First A380 powered by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel takes to the skies - Airbus,"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1maXJzdC1hMzgwLXBvd2VyZWQtYnktMTAwLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLWZ1ZWwtdGFrZXMtdG8tdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 28 March 2022 – Airbus has performed a first A380 flight powered by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Airbus’ A380 test aircraft MSN 1 took off from Blagnac Airport, Toulouse, France at 08h43 on Friday 25 March. The flight lasted about three hours, operating one Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on 100% SAF.

27 tonnes of unblended SAF were provided by TotalEnergies for this flight. The SAF produced in Normandy, close to Le Havre, France, was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), free of aromatics and sulphur, and primarily consisting of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats. A second flight, with the same aircraft, is scheduled to take place from Toulouse to Nice Airport, on the 29 March to test the use of SAF during take-off and landing.

This is the third Airbus aircraft type to fly on 100% SAF over the course of 12 months; the first was an Airbus A350 in March 2021 followed by an A319neo single-aisle aircraft in October 2021.

Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry’s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Key statistics outlined in the Waypoint 2050 report indicate that SAF could contribute between 53% and 71% of required carbon reductions.

All Airbus aircraft are currently certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. The aim is to achieve certification of 100% SAF by the end of this decade.

The A380 aircraft used during the test is the same aircraft recently revealed as Airbus’ ZEROe Demonstrator - a flying testbed for future technologies instrumental to bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

How an Airbus test on an A380 will try out hydrogen fuel - Popular Science,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlci1yZXNoYXBlcy1haXJjcmFmdC13b3JrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month, Airbus announced plans to overhaul an A380 airliner by adding an additional hydrogen-combustion engine to the outside of the plane and installing monitoring equipment. With the changes, the company will be able to test hydrogen-powered flight in real-world conditions.

The move is part of a broader industry goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Passenger air travel is a growing contributor to climate change, making up about three percent of carbon emissions worldwide in 2021. While flying less and investing in more efficient planes can help reduce emissions, new technologies will likely be needed to reach net zero.

Other solutions, like battery-powered air taxis and sustainable aviation fuels, may help cut emissions, but hydrogen in particular might be one of the major paths forward to net zero because it could be used widely in the industry, from shorter regional hops to longer flights with larger planes.

Airbus’s test plane is actually the first-ever A380, with a serial number of one, says Amanda Simpson, vice president of research and technology for Airbus Americas. The aircraft was originally used for certification of both the original A380 and the engine for the A350. Now, Airbus plans to modify it by adding an extra engine on top that will burn hydrogen instead of traditional jet fuel.

The A380 is the largest passenger airliner in service, leaving plenty of room to install monitoring equipment, as well as store the 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of liquid hydrogen that the plane will carry on board for fuel. (Airbus announced in 2019 that it would stop producing the A380, as the industry moves towards two-engine airliners with greater fuel efficiency.)

The placement of this engine, at the top of the plane and in the back, just in front of the tail, is significant, Simpson says. Because it’s separated from the four engines on the wings that will burn traditional jet fuel, Airbus will be able to fly another plane behind the A380 in flight and sample only the emissions from the hydrogen fuel.

Understanding emissions from hydrogen combustion in real-air conditions is one of the major goals of this testing program, Simpson says. While burning liquid hydrogen doesn’t produce CO2, the most abundant greenhouse gas, researchers are still eager to learn more about emissions from hydrogen-powered flight. Hydrogen engines will still produce some nitrous oxides, which are common pollutants, as well as water vapor, which acts as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

The test engine will also allow Airbus to learn more about how best to run hydrogen combustion in flight. Researchers can change the operating conditions of the engine, like the fuel-to-air ratio it burns, and the temperature it runs at, to learn more about how to most efficiently power a hydrogen-powered plane.

Ultimately, these tests are part of the overall plan for Airbus to have a zero-emissions aircraft in service by 2035, Simpson says. In order to meet that deadline, major design decisions will have to be made around 2026, the same year this test craft is expected to take to the sky.

While hydrogen combustion is one of the main possibilities for such a plane, there’s still a chance Airbus will select another technology, Simpson explains. For example, instead of burning hydrogen, it could be combined with oxygen to generate electricity in hydrogen fuel cells. Automotive makers like Toyota and Daimler have been working on developing fuel cells for vehicles, and Simpson says that Airbus is considering the technology, or a hybrid system with both a fuel cell and a combustion engine.

The design of the aircraft these engines might attach to are still being worked out, too. Last year, Airbus revealed three different potential designs for hydrogen-powered aircraft: a prop plane, a small regional jet, and a concept plane that’s a different shape from most commercial aircraft today. It’s a blended-wing body.

This range of designs says something about the future of hydrogen-powered planes, as well as one of the major challenges of hydrogen-powered planes: fuel storage, says Jayant Mukhopadhaya, an analyst at the International Council for Clean Transportation.

Hydrogen is much less dense than traditional jet fuel, even when it’s compressed at high pressures. Comparing the amount of jet fuel and hydrogen needed to generate the same power, hydrogen takes up at least about four times more space.

The storage protocols are different, too. In most planes today, jet fuel lives in the wings. However, hydrogen needs to be contained at high pressures and low temperatures, so it tends to be kept in larger, cylindrical tanks. These tanks can’t fit in the wings of traditional aircraft designs, and instead need to be in the body. The volume of hydrogen needed to fuel a plane can severely limit the remaining space, reducing passenger capacity by a third or more.

Hydrogen requires a different storage solution than traditional jet fuel . Airbus

Aircraft would likely need to be totally redesigned in order to better fit hydrogen inside. One of the concept planes Airbus revealed last year, the blended-wing body design, is an example of a configuration that would better use space for fuel storage. This model in particular may also have other benefits over traditional plane designs, like increasing the aerodynamic efficiency by ten percent or more, Simpson says.

Trying out totally new shapes likely won’t happen fast enough for the first hydrogen-powered planes, Mukhopadhaya says, so companies will probably have to retrofit existing designs to carry large tanks of hydrogen fuel. But eventually, hydrogen combustion could reconfigure what we think of as airplanes.

While these new aircraft could overhaul the industry, even just the two more familiar designs that Airbus released could have a major impact on aviation—the small regional jet and prop plane would together be able to service about a third of all passenger miles flown today, according to a recent ICCT analysis that Mukhopadhaya co-authored.

There are still major challenges to implementing hydrogen-combustion planes, including limited fueling infrastructure, higher costs, and concerns about how sustainable the hydrogen supply is. And longer flights on larger planes will likely take longer to switch over to hydrogen, because of the limited space on board for fuel.

But testing hydrogen-powered engines in real flight conditions could be a major step to legitimizing the technology, and could bring aviation one step closer to reaching net-zero emissions. For now, we’ll have to wait for 2026 to learn more from Airbus’s A380 flight tests."
An A380 superjumbo just completed a flight powered by cooking oil - CNN,"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc2FmLWNvb2tpbmctb2lsLXNjbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc2FmLWNvb2tpbmctb2lsLXNjbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

It’s huge, it’s wide, and it’s potentially a lot more sustainable. The Airbus A380, a behemoth of the skies, has completed a trial flight powered on cooking oil.

The test airplane completed a three-hour flight from Blagnac Airport in Toulouse – Airbus’ French headquarters – on 25 March. It was powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF – predominantly made of used cooking oil and waste fats – and operating on a single Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine.

Airbus then followed up with a second A380 flight, using the same cooking oil fuel, on March 29, flying from Toulouse to Nice. The second flight was to monitor SAF use during take-off and landing.

The fuel used was supplied by TotalEnergies, a company based in France’s Normandy region. It was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which is free of both aromatics and sulfur.

Airbus has been testing the use of SAF-powered flights for the last year, with an A350 being tested in March 2021, and an A319neo single-aisle aircraft flying on cooking oil in October. The company hopes to get its aircraft certified to fly on SAF by the end of the decade. Currently, Airbus aircraft can be powered by up to 50% SAF, blended with traditional kerosene.

“Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry’s ambition of netzero carbon emissions by 2050,” said Airbus in a statement. The company claims that flying planes on SAF could net between 53% to 71% of the carbon reductions required to meet that goal.

Airbus plans to bring the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

SAF, which claims carbon neutrality because of the CO2 absorbed while its organic ingredients are being grown, is already being used in limited amounts by some airlines. But high prices mean that widespread adoption isn’t expected anytime soon.

The world’s largest passenger airplane, the A380’s fortunes have been in decline in recent years with several airlines calling time on their use, partly on the grounds that they’re less fuel efficient than more modern long-range airplanes. Airbus delivered the final ever A380 to Dubai airline Emirates in late 2021.

More recently, Airbus announced that the giant plane would be pressed into service to test an experimental hydrogen-powered engine, another innovation aimed at making flying less environmentally harmful.

Airbus and Boeing to halt supply of aircraft parts to Russian airlines - The Guardian,"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL21hci8wMi9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy10by1oYWx0LXN1cHBseS1vZi1haXJjcmFmdC1wYXJ0cy10by1ydXNzaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVz0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvbWFyLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLXRvLWhhbHQtc3VwcGx5LW9mLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXBhcnRzLXRvLXJ1c3NpYW4tYWlybGluZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has joined Boeing in halting the supply of aircraft parts and services to Russian airlines, squeezing its aviation industry amid the invasion of Ukraine.

The European aerospace firm said on Wednesday it was suspending support and delivery of spare parts, in line with international sanctions.

Boeing stopped work with Russian airlines on Tuesday night after Joe Biden announced further US sanctions against Moscow, following Britain and the EU in banning Russian planes from its airspace.

Q&A Brands that have quit Russia Show A number of companies have pulled their operations and services in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. These include: Retailers Ikea has temporarily closed all stores and factories in Russia, affecting 15,000 workers. It has shuttered its 17 outlets across Russia but said it would keep its Mega shopping centres open.

H&M has temporarily suspended all sales in Russia. The firm said that shops in Ukraine had already been closed temporarily “due to the safety of customers and colleagues”.

JD Sports has ceased all trading in Russia across both its brand websites and wholesale channels, adding that it represented less than 0.05% of annual revenues.

Mango, the Spanish clothing retailer, said it was temporarily closing its shops and its online sale website in Russia, while it is monitoring “with sadness and concern” the situation in Ukraine.

Nike has said it is stopping Russian customers from buying online.

Adidas has suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union.

Marks & Spencer has suspended shipments to its Turkish franchisee’s Russian business. Operation ceased last week at its 10 stores in Ukraine, which employs 250 people. It has 48 stores in Russia and 1,200 employees, also via the franchisee.

Boohoo has halted sales in Russia and closed its Russian trading websites.

Asos has suspended sales in Russia. It said it was “neither practical nor right to continue to trade in Russia”. Travel Airbnb has suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus. It has also taking bookings from people in both countries.

Expedia has stopped selling travel in and out of Russia. Carmakers Volkswagen has stopped production of vehicles in Russia “until further notice”. Vehicle exports to Russia have also been stopped ""with immediate effect”, it said.

Toyota halted production at its St Petersburg plant and vehicle imports into the country have also stopped indefinitely.

General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Renault have halted sales and operations in Russia. Mercedes-Benz said it will stop selling cars and vans to Russia, as has Aston Martin. Harley-Davidson has halted motorcycle shipments to Russia. Drinks industry Diageo, the maker of Smirnoff vodka and Guinness has paused exports to Russia and Ukraine.

Coca-Cola HBC has halted production at its bottling factory in Kyiv and evacuated its employees. Tech, media and entertainment Apple has paused sales in Russia.

Meta, owner of Facebook, said it had stopped recommending content from Russian state media to all users of Facebook, with Instagram to follow.

Google has suspended all advertising in Russia after the country’s internet regulator demanded the company stop showing what it considered were adverts displaying false information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Walt Disney Company is pausing its release of films in Russia.

Netflix said it has no plans to distribute news, sports and entertainment channels from Russian state media. Luxury goods companies Burberry has halted all shipments of luxury goods to Russia “due to operational challenges"". Manufacturing JCB, the British construction equipment maker, said it had paused all operations, including the export of machine and spare parts in the country.

Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

The Seattle-based manufacturer said: “We have suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv. We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines.

“As the conflict continues, our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region.”

Boeing and Airbus were unwilling to predict how halting the supply of parts would affect Russian aviation in the short and medium term. The two manufacturers’ plane account for almost two-thirds of the Russian fleet – 332 Boeing and 304 Airbus aircraft. While maintenance and repair of all aircraft in service is routine and ongoing, the impact is unlikely to be immediate unless critical parts fail.

Western leasing firms will also attempt to repossess jets operated by Russian carriers, with 515 planes leased from foreign companies, according to the aviation and air travel data company Cirium.

Analysts said leased planes on the ground in Russia could be cannibalised to keep others flying. Peter Walter, of the industry consultant IBA, told Reuters: “Because parts are limited, we will expect to see aircraft that are on the ground in Russia being robbed in order to keep the remainder of the fleet operational.”

Sanctions will block the delivery of 37 new planes to Russian airlines this year, comprised mostly of Boeing’s relicensed 737 Max model, with 25 due to go to Utair. A further 25 planes are on order, according to IBA, including 13 of Airbus’s wide-body A350 model set for Aeroflot, Russia largest airline.

Airbus was on Wednesday deciding whether it could continue to keep open its Moscow engineering centre to keep providing services to Russian customers. Some work has been suspended temporarily at the centre. Known as ECAR, it was set up as a joint venture with Russian firms and investors in 2003 and employs 200 Russian engineers.

The German maintenance group Lufthansa Technik also said it had stopped serving Russian customers.

The developments will leave Russian aviation increasingly isolated. Russia’s aviation industry is significant, accounting for about 6% of flights worldwide last year during the pandemic, although almost nine in 10 Aeroflot flights were internal.

Firms in other sectors, meanwhile, have continued to announce their withdrawal from Russian ventures. The energy group ExxonMobil said it would not invest in new developments in Russia because of the attack on Ukraine.

ExxonMobil also said it would start taking steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 project, the vast oil and gas fields it operates for an international consortium on the island on the far north-east of Russia.

It follows competitors in stopping joint operations with Russia, with Shell severing ties with Gazprom and BP offloading its stake in Rosneft.

Direct Publishing of Airbus Imagery to ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online using ArcGIS Notebooks - Esri,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcmkuY29tL2FyY2dpcy1ibG9nL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2FyY2dpcy1vbmxpbmUvaW1hZ2VyeS9hcmNnaXMtbm90ZWJvb2tzLXRvLWFyY2dpcy1pbWFnZS1vbmxpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagery is so much more than a pretty picture. It is captured with the goal of extracting information from it, whether through visualization or analysis. However, imagery must be shared before it can be used and this can often be a time consuming process. This article outlines the advantages of using ArcGIS Notebooks for direct publishing. - Adapted from ""A Guide to Sharing Imagery and Raster Data""

Motivation

When working on an imagery project, significant time can be spent on file transfers. Imagery providers leverage delivery technologies, including FTP and HTTPS, for customers to download their imagery locally. After downloading, users then need to upload their imagery in order to publish services in ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online. While this publishing workflow is fully supported, the imagery is transferred twice over the user’s local internet connection, where download speed—and more commonly, upload speed—can be limiting.

Let’s get some ballpark numbers on potential time savings. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), broadband internet is defined as 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download speed and 3 Mbps upload speed. When download and upload speeds differ, this is referred to as an asymmetrical internet connection. Asymmetrical internet connections are common in both residential and commercial environments to address key internet user profiles, while at the same time addressing bandwidth cost efficiency. Considering these benchmarks above, for a project requiring 10GB of imagery, it would take an hour to download the data, and nearly a full workday to upload. Compared to a commercial cloud environment, which can deliver symmetrical download and upload speeds of ~2,000 Mbps, the process would only take 1 minute in either direction. Better yet, transferring data straight from the imagery provider to ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online via ArcGIS Notebooks only requires moving data once. With ArcGIS Notebooks you can go from days to minutes.

Solution

This article describes the use of ArcGIS Notebooks hosted in ArcGIS Online to decrease the time requirement for file transfers when publishing hosted imagery layers. When hosted in ArcGIS Online, the notebook executes code within a container inside the user’s ArcGIS Online organization. Therefore, imagery downloads directly into ArcGIS Online and does not rely on the internet speed at the user’s computer. Furthermore, while publishing, the imagery is already inside the ArcGIS Online organization, making the upload step very fast. When directing these data transfers with code in an ArcGIS Online hosted notebook, the user maintains full internet bandwidth at their local computer.

Airbus Case Study

Recently, the Airbus Pleiades Neo satellite constellation captured a series of images over St. George’s, Grenada which is available to order using OneAtlas Data, which also offers archive, and tasking products from SPOT 6, SPOT 7, Pleiades 1a, and 1b.

Pleiades Neo provides 30 cm pansharpened multispectral wavelength bands for red, green, blue, near-infrared, red edge, and deep blue. Red edge, and deep blue are new additions to the Pleiades satellite constellation. The red edge band supports improved measurement of plant biophysical parameters including Leaf Area Index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content, as well as the potential for earlier detection of plant stress than possible using near-infrared. The deep blue band helps characterize atmospheric conditions at the time of acquisition, supporting atmospheric correction and dehazing. Deep blue also enhances coastal mapping up to a 35 m depth, with better characterization of water quality and turbidity.

In this case study we published tiled imagery layers in ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online using our API key from OneAtlas Data API to explore all six multispectral bands of Pleiades Neo, across four acquisition dates: Feb 1, 2022, Jan 6, 2022, Sep 24, 2021, and Nov 4, 2021 (see below).

Esri’s ArcGIS API for Python delivers a set of classes, methods, and functions to perform data conversion, reclassification, change detection, and more. Esri has also added ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online support, so you can automate the creation of hosted imagery layers, by transferring the imagery directly from OneAtlas Data to ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online.

Methodology

The solution is achieved using an ArcGIS Notebook (click here to download a copy), which can be run interactively or scheduled to run automatically, publishing ongoing Airbus imagery orders for your area of interest. Note: To take advantage of direct file transfers, be sure to add the ArcGIS Notebook as an item in your ArcGIS Online organization before using it.

Result: Visualizing Hosted Imagery

The resulting hosted imagery layers can be explored in the embedded Web Map below, or explored in more details in a separate browser tab:

All of these capabilities – hosting imagery with the full data model including all bands, and full bit depth, sophisticated raster analytics, and automating content delivery—are now all possible using ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online."

This comes as an additional step toward the co-creation of an Urban Air Mobility ecosystem in the Kingdom.

The signing of this agreement is a testimony to the strong partnership between Airbus and THC, as the company already operates 10 H125s, recently added 20 five-bladed H145s (with an option for an additional ten aircraft) and six ACH160 helicopters (with an option for an additional four) to its fleet.

The agreement foresees the decarbonisation of flight operations for Airbus’ products in THC’s fleet. This includes the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels for conventional helicopters, as well as the introduction of urban air mobility (UAM) services in the country. The agreed cooperation between the parties and the aviation regulatory authorities of the kingdom will enable the safe application of these solutions to a variety of mission segments, such as Emergency Medical Services, Eco tourism or Private and Business Aviation.

France and Spain launch Tiger MkIII programme - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1mcmFuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWluLWxhdW5jaC10aWdlci1ta2lpaS1wcm9ncmFtbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 02 March 2022 – OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation), on behalf of the French and Spanish Armament General Directorate, the DGA (Direction Générale de l’Armement) and the DGAM (Dirección General de Armamento y Material) has awarded a contract to Airbus Helicopters for the development, production, and initial in-service support of the Tiger MkIII attack helicopter upgrade programme.

The contract includes the upgrade of 42 aircraft for France (with the possibility to add another 25 helicopters) and 18 for Spain. In addition, the contract provides the possibility for Germany to later join the Tiger MkIII programme. The first prototype is scheduled for an inaugural flight in 2025. First delivery to the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) will take place in late 2029 followed by a first delivery to Spain in 2030. Development and upgrade work will be conducted in Airbus Helicopters facilities in Albacete (Spain), Marignane (France) and Donauwörth (Germany).

“The Tiger MkIII programme will provide a European answer to the need for a state-of-the-art attack helicopter for the decades to come. With this upgrade, the Tiger will remain an essential and modern asset to its armies and reinforce defence cooperation in Europe,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. He added: “The Tiger MkIII will have no equivalent in the world for high intensity operations and will further improve the connectivity, precision, and fire power capabilities of the current Tiger”.

Tiger MkIII is a comprehensive upgrade of the European attack helicopter’s systems. Proven in combat, the Tiger is difficult to detect, highly agile, and highly survivable, something operators will continue to benefit from with the MkIII upgrade. The new standard will allow the platform to be connected to the digital battlefield in order to perform manned-unmanned teaming as well as share tactical information in real time. It will also provide an unrivaled range of weapons (turret gun, laser-guided rockets and missiles) and renewed detection and targeting capabilities. The integration of state-of-the art avionics will reduce the crew’s workload and enable them to be fully focused on mission execution.



The Tiger MkIII standard configuration will include the integration of the Safran Strix NG sights, the Thales FlytX avionics suite, the Topowl DD helmet-mounted sight display, an Indra IFF upgrade, Thales GNSS, and Safran’s inertial navigation system. The communication suite will be upgraded with Thales’ Contact/Synaps radio and data links dedicated to manned/unmanned teaming. Moreover, for Spain Link16 and SATCOM functionalities will be included. The Spanish Tiger MkIII will be equipped with a battlefield management system and countermeasures provided by Indra, whereas the French Tiger MkIII will be equipped with a battlefield management system by ATOS and countermeasures provided by Thales. The new weapon package for France will include the MBDA MAST-F (Future Tactical Air-to-Surface Missile) and Mistral 3 air-to-air missile. For Spain, new capabilities will include 70mm guided rockets and a new air to ground missile.

Airbus Helicopters is fully committed to supporting the Tiger fleet. In 2019, a tri-lateral Global Support Contract was signed with OCCAR. It aimed at boosting the availability rate of the Tigers in service in the French, German, and Spanish Armies. Thanks to this contract, the availability rate for the French Army Tiger fleet has been significantly progressing over the past couple of years. Further positive results are expected in the coming months in Spain, Germany and France.

Airbus signs MOU with Australia's Fortescue Future Industries to study hydrogen - Airbus,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1haXJidXMtc2lnbnMtbW91LXdpdGgtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1mb3J0ZXNjdWUtZnV0dXJlLWluZHVzdHJpZXMtdG_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse / Perth, 8 March 2022 – Airbus has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), a leading Australian company developing renewable energies across the world, to study the use of liquid hydrogen and Power-to-Liquid fuels for aviation.

It reflects the two partners’ shared ambition to leverage their respective expertise to support the entry-into-service of a hydrogen powered aircraft by 2035 and achieve net-zero.

Under the collaboration, the partners will look at the challenges of hydrogen regulations, supply, infrastructure and fueling for aviation, from the production of hydrogen to its delivery to airports and transfer on-board aircraft.

FFI will provide cost outlook and technology drivers on the various elements of the supply chain, and will build infrastructure deployment scenarios for the supply of green hydrogen to targeted airports.

“The time is now for a green revolution in the aviation industry. This exciting collaboration brings together leaders in the aviation industry with leaders in green energy for a better, greener, cleaner future,” FFI founder and chairman Dr. Andrew Forrest AO said.

“We are all citizens of a global world,” FFI founder and chairman Dr. Andrew Forrest AO said. “People want to be able to see their friends and loved ones in other countries. They want to be able to explore new places. They want to see the world. But we also want there to be a world for the future. By helping to enable a greener aviation industry, we pave the way for the future generation to be able to live in this global society too, and doing so without sacrificing the planet.”

Airbus will provide characteristics on fleet energy usage, scenarios for hydrogen demand in aviation, refueling specifications and aviation regulatory framework.

“Partnerships and cross-sectoral approaches are a necessity to make zero emission aviation a reality. Airbus is preparing itself to put a zero emission aircraft in service by 2035. But this will only be possible if we can ensure enough green hydrogen is produced worldwide and I’m thrilled to see FFI enthusiasm with regards to our ambition.” said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP Zero Emission Aircraft."
Airbus' high-voltage battery technology prepares for EcoPulse flight test and beyond - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAzLWFpcmJ1cy1oaWdoLXZvbHRhZ2UtYmF0dGVyeS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1lY29wdWxzZS1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June last year Airbus successfully performed the EcoPulse* wind tunnel testing at its facility in Filton, UK. These tests evaluated the performance characteristics of the propeller and the cooling process of the six ‘distributed’ electric propulsion units. In 2022, the assembly of the demonstrator – a light aircraft platform supplied by Daher* – is well underway, paving the way for its first test flight later this year.

Now we focus the spotlight on another key enabler being finalised for the EcoPulse demonstrator: the high-voltage Lithium-Ion main battery system developed by Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse. While not taking centre-stage visually, this new battery is nevertheless a very significant innovation which is central to the electrification demonstration with EcoPulse, especially as it is pushing the boundaries for high voltage batteries to be used in an aircraft.

The battery itself is approximately 2.3m long by 75cm wide and 20cm deep. It is mounted under the fuselage and integrated with a reinforced aerodynamic fairing. The battery is one of the two electric sources on the demonstrator, the other being an ""e-Auxiliary power Unit"" (e-APU) provided by Safran.

We started to work on the high voltage Li-ion a few years ago and for this prototype we designed it entirely in-house

Julien Laurent, Airbus Battery Project Leader

Power and energy density

Lightweight, compact, with very high battery power and energy density: the battery reaches these goals thanks to several years of research and development as part of Airbus’ aircraft electrification and sustainability initiatives. Less powerful high-voltage batteries were previously installed on CityAirbus and Airbus Helicopters FlightLab. The result of such incremental advances is this latest high-voltage Lithium-Ion battery. The unit, as designed for EcoPulse, weighs around 350kg, is able to achieve 800 Volts DC and can deliver up to 350 kilowatts of power.

Not only is this power level sufficient for driving EcoPulse’s six electric propulsors, depending on the test conditions, but it also happens to be similar to what would be needed for an airliner’s non-propulsive secondary systems. Airbus is exploring the latter separately as part of its “micro-hybridisation” research, with the high-voltage battery concept being a key ‘technology brick’.

Developing the high-voltage Lithium-Ion battery

So then, how was this battery developed, and what were the challenges and accomplishments in realising it?

“We started to work on the high voltage Li-ion a few years ago,” recalls Julien Laurent, Battery Project Leader, and for this prototype we designed it entirely in-house.”

He explains some notable features: “Our design featured several thousand Lithium-Ion cells, incorporating various safety measures to prevent thermal runaway – such as connecting each cell with wire bonding. Another innovative part is the active cooling system which ensures the optimum temperature for normal operation. Furthermore, this battery system also includes a tailored Battery Management System. This helps to minimise maintenance thanks to its built-in test features and ability to highlight the charge status or whether the cells need to be rebalanced.”

The battery’s high-voltage capability when applied in this context is unique since it is not available today either in aerospace or automotive industries. Notably, the heavier batteries which are used today on aircraft are typically quite low voltage – 28Vdc – and their low energy density means that they are mainly used to start the APU and for emergencies. Moreover, the majority of these are Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) based – which, under the EU’s REACH regulation, will soon have to make way for alternative environmentally-compliant battery chemistries, such as Lithium-Ion.

As for the automotive industry, while there are indeed batteries currently used to power electric cars, these have been too bulky and heavy for aerospace use. In short there are currently no standalone off-the-shelf battery systems which can fulfill our needs in terms of safety and performance.



Manufacturing and testing objectives

Following cell selection and subsequent design integration for EcoPulse, several prototype/specimen batteries will very soon be subjected to testing in Toulouse according to stringent aeronautical standards. These tests will evaluate performance, and environmental and safety attributes, so that the team can be confident it will behave properly and safely once installed into the EcoPulse vehicle.

By understanding high voltage battery behaviour thanks to this testing, Airbus will develop vital competence for applying micro-hybridisation architectures to future aircraft, for example, to optimise power/energy management of non-propulsive functions such as air conditioning, auto flight, and flight controls.

In summary, with EcoPulse we are making some of the bricks which make sense for the global strategy of Airbus. These bricks will help us to develop a wide portfolio of technical and industrial skills to prepare our future platforms to support decarbonisation. There is no one single prospective solution to decarbonise the future Airbus aircraft, but rather, several ones, including the wings, hydrogen, the structure, the flight controls etc. Hybridisation, thanks to batteries such as this, is just one of the enablers which we will need to decarbonise.

This A380 is the latest to test 100% SAF - Airbus,"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAzLXRoaXMtYTM4MC1pcy10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LXRvLXRlc3QtMTAwLXNhZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A380 is one of the most iconic aircraft ever made. Since entering into service in 2007, the world’s largest and most spacious passenger jet has set a new benchmark for in-flight comfort. It has also raised the bar for environmental standards thanks to exceptional fuel efficiency and low noise levels. In fact, the latest Airbus programmes continue to benefit from the many innovations developed for the A380.

A380 takes off with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel show more show less Watch the take-off of the A380 MSN1 operating one engine on 100% SAF. This milestone marks the third Airbus aircraft -- following the A350 and the A319neo -- to test unblended sustainable aviation fuel.

Now, this incredible feat of engineering is set to further enhance its legacy by playing a vital role in helping to achieve certification of 100% SAF by 2030.

This is because, when the A380 MSN1 departed from Toulouse’s Blagnac airport on 25 March, 2022, one of its four engines operated on 100% SAF. The A380 thus officially joins a group of select aircraft that have performed this type of in-flight test – one that includes the A350 and the A319neo. It also marks the first flight test campaign to use 100% SAF on all flight phases, from take-off and climb to cruise and landing.

“This is the first time that unblended SAF has been used on an A380 flight test platform,” explains Wolfgang Absmeier, Airbus Test Pilot. “The flight test met all of our requirements, which will enable us to carry out the next phase of the project consisting of specific engine manoeuvers.”

“This is another great example of the aviation industry coming together to work towards achieving certification of 100% SAF by 2030. Together, we’ve clearly demonstrated that an aircraft as large as the A380 can successfully operate on unblended SAF.”

François Pfindel, Airbus Head of A380 MAP

An industry-wide decarbonisation initiative

The flight test campaign is supported by a variety of partners. Rolls-Royce is conducting compatibility studies related to the engine adaptation for the Trent 900. Pratt & Whitney is providing support for the auxiliary power unit (APU). And TotalEnergies is supplying the unblended SAF.

Indeed, the 100% SAF is made from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which generally consists of used cooking oil and other waste fats. What sets this SAF apart is that it is not mixed with any fossil fuels. Approximately 27 tonnes of SAF will be used for the flight test campaign and is produced in Normandy close to Le Havre, France.

“This is another great example of the aviation industry coming together to work towards achieving certification of 100% SAF by 2030,” explains François Pfindel, Airbus Head of A380 MAP. “Together, we’ve clearly demonstrated that an aircraft as large as the A380 can successfully operate on unblended SAF.”

Airbus has tested unblended sustainable aviation fuel across its product range, from single-aisle and wide-body to superjumbo. Discover the characteristics of each flight test campaign. <br />

An ambitious flight test campaign

Current research programmes – ECLIF3 and VOLCAN – will continue their test campaigns throughout 2022 and 2023 with the A350 and the A319neo. Because the A380 MSN1 has a very limited test window available, the test campaign’s focus is to gather as much data across the aircraft as possible over a two-week period.

While the first flight test phase focuses on outboard engine behaviour of 100% SAF and APU testing, the forthcoming second flight test phase will test this fuel type on the inboard engine and its impact on fuel gauging. On 29 March, the A380 will take off from Toulouse, head towards Nice and return to Toulouse in order to increase engine exposure to 100% SAF.

“Due to the A380’s engine and fuel system configuration, analysing engine and fuel system behaviours with 100% SAF needs to be managed over multiple flights,” François explains. “In doing so, we’ll generate a wealth of data that will help us to complement the research programmes currently underway.”



Following this 100% SAF flight test campaign spanning two weeks, the A380 MSN1 will be renovated to restore its aircraft testing capability and subsequently transformed into the ZEROe demonstrator to test hydrogen combustion technology in the years to come."
India aircraft demand seen at 2210 over next 20 years - Airbus,"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1pbmRpYS1haXJjcmFmdC1kZW1hbmQtc2Vlbi1hdC0yMjEwLW92ZXItbmV4dC0yMC15ZWFyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Passenger traffic to grow at 6.2% annually over the next two decades

Fleet will need 1,770 new small* and 440 medium and large** aircraft

India will need additional 34,000 pilots; 45,000 technicians by 2040

Hyderabad, March 24, 2022: India will require 2,210 new aircraft over the next 20 years, according to Airbus’ latest India Market Forecast. That fleet could comprise 1,770 new small and 440 medium and large aircraft.

Over the next decade, India will grow to have the largest population in the world, its economy will grow the fastest among the G20 nations, and a burgeoning middle class will spend more on air travel. As a result, passenger traffic in India will grow at 6.2% per annum by 2040, the fastest among the major economies and well above the global average of 3.9%.



India has witnessed an upward trend in the growth of air traffic over the last ten years – with domestic traffic growing almost threefold and international traffic more than doubling. On international routes, India has only about 1/10th of the widebody fleet installed in similar markets, depriving homegrown carriers of a larger share of the profitable long-haul routes now dominated by foreign airlines.



“We have seen India’s domestic market develop strongly with our flagship A320 aircraft. It is time now for Indian carriers to unlock the potential of international travel in and out of India, leveraging the country’s demographic, economic and geographic dividends,” said Rémi Maillard, President and MD, Airbus India & South Asia.



“Whether it is expanding existing airlines or supporting new airlines, there must now be a re-fleeting and rethinking about future-oriented solutions with technology that paves the way for sustainable long-range travel. The A350 is the perfect solution for that,” Maillard said, announcing the India Market Forecast on the opening day of the Wing India air show being held at Hyderabad from March 24 to 27, 2022.

The purchase is in response to ongoing efforts by NASA’s Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program to identify commercial satellite data and associated metadata that may benefit NASA Earth science research. A one-year assessment of the Airbus U.S. data products is underway, with the assessment of BlackSky products to begin shortly.

Airbus U.S. is providing a comprehensive catalog of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth observation products from their TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, and PAZ X-band radar satellites along with their suite of elevation data products derived from radar data. The data and imagery offer high temporal and spatial resolution to provide high-resolution imagery and precise elevation information for nearly any point on Earth, independent of cloud cover and weather. The products are applicable to various NASA Earth science investigations, including monitoring drift ice in the absence of daylight, detecting surface movement in oil and gas fields, and identifying objects in remote areas.

BlackSky data are from its constellation of 12 satellites that provide imagery in four reflective bands: red, green, blue, and panchromatic. These satellites are part of BlackSky’s second-generation, or Gen-2, satellites, which are deployed in both Sun-synchronous and mid-inclination orbits to facilitate global coverage. The high spatial and temporal dawn-to-dusk imagery from BlackSky can be used for a wide range of pattern-of-life and anomaly detection research.

Image

Airbus U.S. and BlackSky responded to a Request for Information (RFI) released in October 2019. The RFI was part of CSDA’s on-ramp #2 to assess the utility of commercial smallsat data in achieving goals and objectives related to the NASA Earth Science Division’s Research and Analysis and Applied Sciences Programs. Companies operating commercial small satellite constellations with a minimum of three satellites in non-geostationary orbit with consistent, large-scale coverage were invited to submit a capability statement.

CSDA is a component of NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program and is charged with identifying, evaluating, and acquiring commercial remote sensing imagery and data that support NASA’s Earth science research and application activities. These commercial data may inform any of NASA’s research focus areas: carbon cycle and ecosystems, climate variability and change, atmospheric composition, water and energy cycle, weather and atmospheric dynamics, and Earth surface and interior. The data also may enhance information and situational awareness related to NASA’s applications themes of disasters, water resources, ecological forecasting, health and air quality, food security, energy, and wildfires as well as NASA’s international development efforts."

This contract completes the previous co-engineering phase dedicated to the design and qualification of the units customized to follow Airbus needs under the corresponding development contracts.

Also for the OneSat program, SENER Aeroespacial was awarded with several contracts: the supply of the telemetry, tracking and command (TTC) antennas; and, in mechanisms and actuators, the traditional area of expertise of SENER Aeroespacial, the rotary actuator, being the first electromechanical product designed by SENER Aeroespacial for the space industry that is series produced, with more than 90 units delivered; and the Ejection Mechanism, part of the SSD (Spacecraft Separation Device), manufactured, assembled and tested by SENER in Poland, a company of SENER Aeroespacial.

In this regard, SENER Aeroespacial has strengthened its collaboration with Airbus Defense and Space in the last years, with significant work as a key supplier in several satellites and programs, highlighting the contribution in OneSat, a new paradigm in reconfigurable satellites. This performance made the company to win, in October 2021, the Competitiveness Award during the ‘Suppliers Day’ held annually by Airbus Defence and Space to recognize its best suppliers. In 2019, SENER Aeroespacial also received the “Best Improver” award in the “Equipment & Systems” category for its excellent performance in two other important Airbus projects: Inmarsat-6 and METOP.

In words of the General Director of Space and Science of SENER Aeroespacial, Diego Rodriguez, after receiving the Competitiveness Award from Airbus,”We have doubled our efforts to grow with AIRBUS, in what is a clear case of successful collaboration in the aerospace environment. The results have been very satisfactory with relevant participations in both their institutional and Telecom satellites.”

OneSat represents the paradigm of the mass production in the space market, which seems to be the future of the commercial space sector worldwide. According to Airbus, OneSat will revolutionize the telecommunications satellite market: unlike earlier satellites that were designed for specific missions, OneSat can be fully reconfigured while on-orbit and is able to adjust its coverage area, capacity and frequency “on the fly” to meet changing mission scenarios.

Boeing Plans 737 MAX Production Hike to 47 Aircraft per Month Next Year

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 22 and 49 commercial jets in February 2022, compared to 22 and 32 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Year to date, Boeing and Airbus have delivered 54 and 79 aircraft, compared to 48 and 53, respectively, in January and February of last year. With only 22 shipments in February, Boeing had a quiet month but is still six aircraft ahead of the first two months of 2021. Airbus is now 26 jets ahead of last year’s shipment totals to date.

Following a more than challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. 2022 is expected to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry. However, Boeing and Airbus still have quite a way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels. For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 and 380 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2024 or 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite ongoing Dreamliner quality issues, things are now looking brighter than at any time since March 2019, when the second 737 MAX crash occurred. Orders are strong and deliveries have surged from the 2020 lows, with another sharp increase expected this year. In addition, the 737 MAX is poised to resume commercial flights in China any day now – well over a year after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ungrounded the aircraft in November 2020.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in February 2022, Boeing delivered 22 jets, including 20 737s (all MAX), one 747-8F, and one 777F. The 737 program is currently producing at a rate of 27 per month, up from 19 by the end of October 2021, and continues to progress toward a near-term target of 31 per month. According to Reuters, Boeing has preliminary plans to boost 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023, followed by another increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023. No 787s were delivered in February. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The FAA is reviewing Boeing’s method for inspecting and evaluating the aircraft to ensure it meets federal safety regulations. In February, the head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, stated that the agency needs a “systemic fix” from Boeing to address Dreamliner production issues and would not allow the company to self-certify individual new jets when deliveries resume. However, the FAA has acknowledged that Boeing is heading in the right direction. The FAA wants Boeing to ensure it has a robust plan for the rework that it performs on a large number of new 787s in storage and demonstrate that its delivery processes are stable. According to Boeing, the company is continuing to complete comprehensive inspections across the 787 production system and within the supply chain, while holding detailed, transparent discussions with the FAA, suppliers, and customers. The company continues to perform rework on 787 airplanes in inventory and is engaged in detailed discussions with the FAA.

At the end of last year, Boeing had 110 Dreamliners in storage (manufactured but not yet certified). The current 787 production rate is approximately two aircraft per month, and Boeing expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time. It is currently unknown when deliveries will be allowed to continue. The 777 program will get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X, and Boeing announced recently that it will increase the 777/777X production rate from two to three per month in 2022. On January 31, 2022, Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter, thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In February 2022, Airbus delivered 49 jets, including four A220s, 36 A320s (all NEO), three A330s, and six A350s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by summer 2023. Airbus has also discussed a scenario with a rate of 70 by Q1 2024. Longer term, the company is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 by 2025. The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of five aircraft per month. The rate will be increased to six in early 2022 – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and will be increased to six by early 2023. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that will be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021, Airbus launched the new A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F, 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November and will predominantly compete with the 777F. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). In December 2021, Airbus delivered the 251st and final A380 to Emirates. The A380 is an impressive feat of aeronautical engineering and will, despite its lack of financial success, be forever enshrined in the annals of aviation history. With 123 A380s purchased, Emirates took delivery of nearly half the A380 fleet and currently operates 121 of the superjumbos.

Turning to the February orders review, Boeing had a satisfactory month and booked three orders for a total of 37 jets. The company also reported five cancellations (one 737 MAX and four 787s), resulting in 32 net new orders in total. The largest order was for 18 737 MAXs placed by Air Lease Corporation, followed by an order from an undisclosed customer for 14 737 MAX jets. Another undisclosed customer ordered five 777Fs. In 2021, Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). In 2020, Boeing accumulated a total of 184 gross orders and received 655 cancellations, for a total of -471 net new orders.

Following a slow start to 2022 in January, Airbus reported strong numbers in February. The company booked seven orders for a total of 113 jets. Airbus also reported 42 cancellations (20 A330-900s, 17 A320neos, and five A350-900s), resulting in 71 net new orders. In particular, the A220-300 was in high demand and JetBlue Airways and Aviation Capital Group ordered 30 and 20 aircraft of this type, respectively. Kuwaiti airline Jazeera Airways ordered 28 A320neo family jets (20 A320neo / 8 A321neo). In addition, Singapore Airlines ordered seven A350 freighters, while Kuwait Airways ordered three A321neos and three A330-900 widebody jets.

In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments are included, Boeing comes out ahead with 535 net new orders. In 2020, Airbus accumulated 383 gross orders and received 115 cancellations, for a total of 268 net new orders.

At the end of February 2022, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,058 jets, of which 6,320, or 90 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 667 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of February, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,189 aircraft, of which 4,173, or 80 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.2 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 11.6 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.4 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.3 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 1.98. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.70. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

2022 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast data from the Civil Aircraft Forecast product. For 2022, Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 455 and 702 commercial jets, respectively. Compared to the 2021 level, this is a 33.8 percent increase for Boeing and a 14.9 percent increase for Airbus.

On January 26, Boeing reported Q4 and full-year 2021 earnings and operating results but did not provide any guidance on expected 2022 deliveries. Airbus reported 2021 earnings on February 17 and expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2022. As the basis for its 2022 guidance, Airbus assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, and its own internal operations.

The trinational Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program — intended to provide a swath of new military capabilities to France, Germany, and Spain by 2040 – has yet to enter its research-and-development phase, and risks falling behind schedule if the industry partners cannot compromise on key workshare allowances.

Two of the three prime contractors, Airbus and Dassault, haven’t reached a deal to launch the R&D-related Phase 1B that would lead to a prototype fighter jet by 2027, said Dassault CEO Eric Trappier in a Friday earnings meeting.

“We have done everything possible to sign with Airbus, and I’m waiting for Airbus’ signature,” he said. “The problem is on the other side of the Rhine.”

The Phase 1B contract has been prepared by the French military procurement agency Direction générale de l’armement (DGA), “and we are waiting for Airbus to sign… which is not the case right now,” Trappier said. Dassault is leading France’s industry participation in the FCAS program, while Airbus represents Germany and Indra represents Spain. Indra, who leads Spain’s industry participation in the FCAS program, declined to comment on Friday.

The negotiations, which have dragged on for months now, risk bringing the program to a complete standstill. “There is a moment where we say ‘yes,’ or we say ‘no,’” Trappier continued. “In my opinion, this has gone on a bit too long.”

Per Trappier, the dispute rests on Dassault’s role as the lead for the Next-Generation Fighter element. The program is separated into seven technology “pillars,” each of which is led by a specific company, with subcontractors contributing as well. Dassault is responsible for the new fighter jet, while Airbus leads the “loyal wingman” remote-carrier drone design, along with new cloud capabilities and stealth technologies. Indra leads the sensor systems pillar, while Safran is building a new jet engine for the fighter.

“Dassault should be the leader and the main contractor” for the fighter jet, Trappier said. “Additional requests were introduced to support this program; I said that there was a red line not to be crossed.”

According to Airbus, the kerfuffle boils down to fairness.

“We have managed months ago to find fair and balanced agreements on all 6 other pillars, where even under a defined leadership the competence and capacities of each partner are respected and can participate in an equitable manner,” a spokesman told Defense News. “Airbus has made several proposals to converge also on the Next Generation Fighter (NGF) and we are supporting any solution which will respect both the skills of each partner and the lead role of Dassault Aviation, leading to a fair agreement. We are confident that a resolution can be achieved if the rules of the cooperation agreed by the nations are respected in the NGF, as it is the case on other pillars.”

The program’s stakeholders have long awaited this industry contract. The German, French, and Spanish defense ministers reached their own trinational agreement last summer, which formalized the nations’ funding commitments through Phase 1B and 2, culminating in an initial prototype by 2027. In an Aug. 31 tweet lauding the deal, the German Defense Ministry pointedly said: “Now it’s industry’s turn – come to an agreement.”

The ongoing delay risks pushing back the delivery schedule for the new fighter jet. Meanwhile, Dassault engineers who were due to work on the demonstrator phase have been redeployed elsewhere in the company, Trappier said. They will return to the FCAS program if and when the contract is signed.

“I know they are eager to design an NGF demonstrator,” he said.

The trinational program isn’t the only source of tension between France and Germany at the moment. Reports have emerged that Berlin is once again considering buying U.S.-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as it phases out its aging Tornado fleet, and new Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently announced plans for Germany to invest 100 billion euro (U.S. $110 billion) into its defense.

Trappier, who is also the current president of the French Aerospace Industries Association (GIFAS), said Friday that he is “convinced” Germany will choose the F-35, as it had previously desired. He claimed the Germans are being pressured by the U.S. to use F-35s for their nuclear mission, even as Berlin pays lip service to the need to “Buy European.”

“We will see with our number-one partner, which is Germany, whether the first decision they make [after investing 100 billion euros] is to sign the FCAS contract, or to buy the F-35,” he said.

There was a real push to adapt and be flexible.

As airlines return, or prepare to return to service, FAST talks to Programmes and Services about recent developments and what’s coming up in the future for customers.

Interview with Florent Massou, formerly HO A220 Programme*

*Now HO Wide Body End to End Integration, F. Massou has been replaced by D. Wenninger

Is it true that the A220 performed remarkably well during 2020?

The answer is an overwhelming yes! Even though this is the worst crisis that aviation has faced, we have seen customers continue to fly their A220 aircraft, chiefly because of the low operating costs and high versatility. The A220 was actually the most active fleet in its segment during the crisis - with a minimum of 50% of the fleet in service at the lowest point of the crisis. All aircraft had returned to operation over the summer of 2020. At the end of 2020, following another grounding period, the A220 fleet had fully recovered to pre-crisis level.

What are some of the highlights regarding A220 customers?

We are proud to have welcomed new customers during the pandemic, with first-time deliveries to JetBlue, Air Austral and Air France, to name but a few. Delta was the first customer to receive its A220 from the FAL in Mobile Alabama in October 2020, which comes in addition to the FAL in Mirabel, Quebec.

We launched the ACJ TwoTwenty in October 2020, with the first customer and interior outfitter Comlux. The ACJ is an extra large bizjet which features a signature flexible cabin catalogue based on the A220-100.

And with the A220 now featuring in the Toulouse Airspace Customer Showroom, signed customers can use the mock-up to configure their cabin, experimenting with seats, fabrics and lighting.

What about A220 programme developments and next steps?

In 2019, we announced that the MTOW of the A220 Family was increased by 5,000 lbs and the range by up to 450 nm. Earlier in 2021, we received the authorities’ approval for the A220-300 MTOW for 156,300 lbs - which is higher than expected. So, good news!

The increased MTOW will enable more range on the A220-300, adding additional flexibility for customers with higher payload configurations, for example, enabling higher-density configurations or increased cabin options.

We are now focussed on 3 main challenges: firstly, improving in-service performance to ensure that we remain the benchmark in the market. This includes the maturity of the aircraft in service and supporting our customers via the parts availability provided by Satair, in place since mid-2020. Next, we must increase our production rate and support our supply chain towards an increased production rate, going up to rate 14 in the coming years. Finally, we need to keep on improving the profitability of the programme which we do through activities to lower the aircraft production cost, while ensuring the same level of quality upon delivery and in-service.

Interview with Michael Menking, HO A320 Programme

What change during the pandemic has made a real difference to customers?

In April 2020, we delivered the very first 100% “e-delivered” aircraft. This was a most rewarding moment that not only made a positive difference to the customer experience, but also showed teamwork, agility and innovation.

As well as affording a means of safe business continuity during the COVID-19 crisis the e-Delivery process, with its new collaborative digital aspects, confers enhanced workflow efficiencies, flexibility, transparency, plus a more environmentally-friendly and smoother overall customer experience. It then became a blueprint for Airbus and customers and was extended across the different programmes.

Has the development of the A321XLR been impacted by the pandemic?

Keeping the A321XLR programme development on time whilst the whole world was hit by the health crisis and its social and economic consequences was a priority. We succeeded together with our suppliers and our teams worldwide, and I am proud to say that the A321XLR is on track for entering into service in 2023.

One of the key factors has been the robust industrial set up with the implementation of the Pilot Line, enabling ramp-up of the A321XLR’s fuselages without impacting the existing A320 Family production operations. Designed in 3D, the Pilot Line allows the perfect integration of the A321XLR design data from the beginning. Also part of the seamless XLR development has been the use of digital and full-size demonstrators, de-risking the route to flight clearance and serial manufacturing. These demonstrators have played a major role in validating all the design work and assembly processes and in ensuring that parts are fully prepared for manufacturing.

Interview with Patrick Piedrafita, HO Widebody Programme

Despite a challenging couple of years, can you tell us about some of the positive news for the A350 Family?

The A350 found a new role as some customers decided to convert their aircraft to carry cargo rather than passengers. The aircraft has proven to be particularly practical in a cargo configuration thanks to its cabin space, its fully flat, horizontal floor and its recessed rails. These “preighters” have already transported tonnes of equipment, industrial products and goods.

Airbus is strongly committed to sustainable solutions so it was great news to resume emission test flights of an A350 using 100% sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). These ongoing tests are part of a series to further develop SAF in aviation.

Customers can now choose to receive delivery of their A350s from the Airbus Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC) in Tianjin, China. This additional option builds on our long-term collaboration with China which started over 30 years ago.

And finally, a new freighter is coming to the market! We officially launched the A350F freighter derivative at the Dubai airshow in November 2021 and currently have two orders for 11 aircraft and 2 letters of intent for 11 more. Entry into service is planned in 2025.

What are some of the latest developments in the A330 Family?

In 2020 we received the type certification for our A330-800 which we were then delighted to deliver to customers Kuwait Airways and Uganda airlines.

We also certified the A330-900 251-tonne weight variant and are in the process of certifying the A330-800 251-tonne version enabling greater capability. Meanwhile, we are expecting to announce the new certification for the A330-900 which will bring an increase in capacity to 459 passengers.

Again in line with our sustainability focus, last May we were proud the A330-900 became the first commercial aircraft world-wide to be certified by EASA for ICAO’s new CO2 emissions standard, in compliance with foreseeable CO2 regulations.

What does the situation look like today for widebody operators?

The widebody programme has certainly been badly hit throughout the crisis with long-haul flights suspended and we are not yet back to normal. Our initial concern was to support our customers in this difficult time and we adapted our production rates to cope with new delivery plans.

Today, we are ready to move ahead and have planned to increase production rates for both aircraft types to meet customer demand. This demand is already visible in the 25 A330 orders already made in 2021. We confirm a 50% ramp-up in production on the A330 for the end of November 2022.

Furthermore, we are working with operators to analyse how to optimise their current and future widebody fleets to maximise operational efficiency as they emerge from the crisis.

Interview with Pierre-Henri Brousse, HO Fleet Efficiency, Customer Services

Returning to service after such an extraordinary pause in operations is quite a challenge for customers. What have you been doing to help them?

Covid has taught us some lessons and created even bigger needs for adaptability and reactiveness in terms of aircraft support. We need to think more like our customers.

The first challenge for customers during the lock-downs was how to manage their grounded aircraft. Standard maintenance procedures exist of course for short-term parking and longer-term storing aircraft. However, the sheer quantity of grounded aircraft called for adapted measures such as extending inspection times whilst protecting airworthiness (see Parking & Storage - FAST article).

We also took a close look at our training offers to develop remote/virtual solutions. It was important for pilots and mechanics to maintain and refresh their qualifications and competences even during travel restrictions, in readiness for a return to service.

With 82% of the Airbus fleet in operation or parked in flying condition (as of 30 November 2021), adapting services to support customers and contribute to the industry’s resilience is key. This covers maintenance guidelines and programmes, including reinforced cleaning procedures, more flexible services such as Flight Hour Services (FHS) components-on-demand and different aircraft usage/aircraft versatility such as carrying cargo in the cabin.

Airbus family formation flight with A220-300, A319neo, A330neo and A350-1000

What’s new or coming soon for customers?

We accelerated the Airbus Customer Care Centre project, which has now gone live. This is an enhanced version of our 24/hour AOG centre, with a reinforced team from Engineering and Customer Services. The team works very closely together to offer higher reactivity and quicker, easier-to-implement solutions to operators to prevent and resolve in-service incidents.

The in-service fleet support includes 3 types of support:

Reactive support: providing solutions to in-service issues encountered by operators and MROs such as AOG situations, operational and maintenance queries not already covered by technical documentation

Corrective support: providing fleet-wide solutions to increase fleet efficiency based on customer in-service feedback. This may then lead to service bulletins.

Anticipation support: preventing operational disruptions based on predictive models using in-service data. This can result in pre-defined solutions provided in advance, and technical documentation updates.

With this new set-up, we are reinforcing the ‘extended enterprise’ customer mindset and increasing collaboration efficiency. Meanwhile, using new technologies will help reduce incidents and increase our reactivity.

The crisis has put an enormous strain on the whole of the aviation industry. At the same time, it has pushed Airbus to become faster, more creative and more flexible in what it does and how it does it.

Progress has been made despite the challenging work conditions, bringing customers new aircraft capabilities for greater flexibility, the Customer Care Centre for reinforced support, and a robust industrial system to meet demand. Airbus is also investing in the post-crisis and future era by modernising its industrial system. This will bring greater industrial and production flexibility.

And projects to fly into the future include developing sustainability initiatives (Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the different families and the BelugaXL), and major programmes such as the A321XLR and the A350 Freighter.

A host of new performance and safety enhancing technologies for Airbus single-engine helicopters - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1hLWhvc3Qtb2YtbmV3LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWFuZC1zYWZldHktZW5oYW5jaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy1mb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dallas, 9 March 2022 - Airbus Helicopters puts the spotlight on recently developed improvements for its single-engine helicopter family aimed at enhancing performance and flight safety.

Following the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification in April 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the U.S. and Transport Canada (TCCA) in Canada have recently certified the H125 power upgrade, which increases the aircraft’s performance by up to 10% by making full use of the available power of the existing Safran Helicopter Engines Arriel 2D engine. This major evolution, allowing H125 operators to benefit from up to 320 lb (145 Kg) of additional payload and already proposed as baseline in Europe, will be included as a standard feature at no additional cost on all new H125s delivered in North America as of Q2 2022.

The additional payload gains get even bigger when the power upgrade is coupled with the BLR FastFin tail rotor enhancement and stability system, which received FAA certification last month. The cumulative payload gain is up to 485 lb (220 Kg).

“Improving aviation safety while boosting the competitiveness of our products is one of our top priorities at Airbus Helicopters. With the H125 having raised the bar to unprecedented levels in terms of performance and value for money, Airbus Helicopters has also worked in the last year to bring several new features which will significantly enhance the flight safety of the H125 and the H130,” says Axel Aloccio, Head of Light Helicopters Programme at Airbus Helicopters.

Among the new safety enhancing technologies, a new light data recorder will be available as optional equipment for H125 operators in the last quarter of 2022 and later for H130 operators; hardened and lightweight, this system will record flight data so that all information can be retrieved in the event of an incident. In parallel, all forward-fit H125s and H130s will be equipped, by the end of 2022 and in early 2023 respectively, with a wireless airborne communication system (wACS) from Astronautics Corporation of America as baseline equipment. This system will allow H125 and H130 operators to automatically retrieve their flight, mission, and maintenance data via a 4G or WiFi connection. They will also gain access to Airbus Helicopters’ connected services such as FlyScan predictive maintenance and Flight Analyser flight data monitoring. In addition, the system will have the option to act as an onboard server to interconnect devices and provide passengers and crew with air-to-air and air-to-ground internet on board.

Airbus Helicopters is also announcing the extension of a series of commercial incentives in 2022 to support H125, AS350 and EC130 B4 customers with the retrofit of their fleets with the Crash Resistant Fuel System (CRFS).Airbus Helicopters is introducing a new € 13,000 ($ 15,000) voucher for each CRFS kit purchase, that can be used at any Airbus Helicopter’s approved service centre to pay for CRFS installation and labour costs.

Training being another key element of flight safety, Airbus Helicopters and VRM Switzerland have finalised a partnership agreement for the world’s first H125 virtual reality simulator, a small and lightweight full-motion training device using a virtual reality headset that can fit in any mid-sized aircraft hangar and can be easily transported to multiple sites.

Last but not least, on the H130 side, a brand-new Instrumental panel is available from Q1 2022. Featuring a new Garmin G500H TXi touchscreen main flight display – bigger and brighter than the previous display – com/nav radio GTN650Xi, electronic standby instrument EFD 750, a glove-box in the control panel, a foldable iPad mount and USB plugs, this new cockpit will provide pilots with a significantly-improved human-machine interface and will ease pilot's workload while freeing up valuable space on the control panel.

Facktor recently spoke with McKinsey’s Jess Harrington about her responsibilities at Airbus U.S., the future of the aerospace sector, and her experience as a woman in a male-dominated industry. Excerpts of their conversation follow.

McKinsey: First, tell me about your job. What areas are you focused on?

Debra Facktor: I’m an engineer by training, but I don’t do engineering every day anymore. My job today is running our U.S. Space Systems line of business, which encompasses small satellites, human space flight, and space exploration. I manage a team of great people who understand all the technical aspects of building satellites and traveling out to space.

The biggest part of my job is business development for our small satellites: showcasing our satellites’ capabilities to customers. I sit on the board of Airbus OneWeb Satellites, which is our joint venture with [London-based communications company] OneWeb, so part of my job is providing leadership on the manufacturing side—making sure that our satellites are built on time, on budget, at high quality. These days I spend a lot of my time on email, it seems, and on virtual phone calls. I’m starting to do a little bit more travel, like to our factory in Florida where we make satellites.

Another part of my job is overseeing our US human space flight and space exploration business. For example, Airbus invested in the Bartolomeo platform, which is a large, payload-hosting platform attached to the International Space Station. So, if a company or agency wants to send a payload out to space—say, for Earth observation or for a scientific experiment—it can use our service.

The space economy of the future

McKinsey: It’s amazing how many companies are now venturing out into space. I’d love your thoughts on where the space sector is headed in the coming years. What new kinds of economic activity might we see in space by 2030?

Debra Facktor: Well, for one thing, I think there will be major advances in human space flight. Even in the past year, we’ve seen great progress in the accessibility of space. In planning your 2030 vacation, you might be able to choose between taking a quick trip to Florida or taking a quick trip to space.

In 2030, when thousands more satellites will be orbiting the Earth, a new opportunity in space might be the on-orbit servicing of satellites. We’re starting to see some companies invest in [on-orbit] refueling or repair services, whether it’s to provide a propulsive boost to the correct orbit or to fix a dead battery.

Today, if your car breaks down on the side of the road at midnight, you can call a service like AAA [American Automobile Association]. You have their phone number; you trust them to come and jump your battery or repair your tire. Imagine you break down on that same road at midnight and a stranger comes up and says, “I’ll fix your car.” You’d probably say, “No, thank you. I’m going to wait until AAA comes or until the police come.” The same thing can happen in space: What is the trusted service for satellites? These are some of the issues for companies to work out. It’s about building not just the technical pieces but also the trustworthiness that makes that kind of business model work.

McKinsey: The notion of trustworthiness in space is interesting; it also comes into play when you think about the increasing risk of collisions in space. What do you see as the greatest threats to the continued growth in space activity between now and 2030?

Debra Facktor: One is overcrowding in space. As you said, with all the thousands of satellites and the human space flight missions going on, there’s more debris and a greater likelihood of things hitting each other. We need to be mindful of our behaviors in space when it comes to space debris. We need to be good neighbors. One of the principles of the US Forest Service, for example, is “pack it in, pack it out”: if you go camping in the woods and create trash, you pack up that trash and bring it back out with you. We need to create those kinds of norms in space.

Another concern is protection of information and cybersecurity. We’re all worried about identity theft or spam in our emails, but what happens if our weather satellites start putting out spam? How does that affect airplanes during landing? That’s just one example. We need to protect both the physical assets and the way that data comes to us, because we rely on that data on a day-to-day basis. One promising technology is laser communication, which will enable more secure communications from one satellite to another, and also between satellites and the ground. When data is communicated via laser, it’s less easily intercepted or jammed than when you’re transmitting using radio frequencies.

Government and industry

McKinsey: Who do you think will be providing space technologies? In other words, what will the space ecosystem look like in 2030? Will it be a mix of billionaire-backed start-ups and larger, traditional players like Airbus?

Debra Facktor: I think the space ecosystem in 2030 will still be a mix of government and industry players but maybe playing different roles. I believe there’s always a role for the government—first of all, to invest in R&D that perhaps has no direct commercial application but enables the next generation of STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] research and engenders creativity and learning. That will continue to be important. Government will take risks where industry is not able to and will continue to provide a reliable infrastructure, a common regulatory regime, and a predictable contractual and legal business environment. All of that is important for commercial companies to succeed.

Commercial companies, on the other hand, innovate by coming up with new applications for existing technologies—including applications that we don’t even know we need. The microwave oven didn’t come about because somebody said, “I need to microwave my food.” You didn’t even know you needed one until it existed; the same thing happened with the cell phone.

What we’re starting to see today, and what could happen frequently by 2030, is that those roles reverse: commercial companies will start challenging the assumptions that the government makes and investing a lot more in rapid-cycle R&D. The government might then take those commercial investments to a new level. We’re already seeing a few examples of that, with the government taking advantage of commercial launch vehicles and commercial investments in low-Earth-orbit satellites, like those we are building in our factory in Merritt Island, Florida.

The future of space: It’s getting crowded out there

Tomorrow’s space workforce

McKinsey: Obviously, given the heightened interest and activity in space, the industry will need to attract more talent. What does the ideal 2030 space workforce look like, and what needs to happen to make it look that way?

Debra Facktor: I love the fact that young people are still excited about space and want to come into our industry. Many little kids want to become astronauts. I hope that, in schools, we continue to encourage young people to be successful in math, science, and technical fields but also recognize that other fields are needed in the space industry. People who know how to communicate, people who know how to draw up contracts, experts in political science, experts in the arts—these are all important parts of our space ecosystem.

One of the most important things we can do is to continue to invest in talent and encourage young people—especially women and underrepresented minorities—to go into fields like aerospace. There are a number of new fellowships designed to help make the aerospace industry a more diverse and dynamic environment, and the individuals who become alumni of these fellowships are going to change the world. I really want to see space companies and agencies have equal representation of women and minorities.

McKinsey: There’s already so much competition in the space sector, and it’s only going to intensify. What do you think will differentiate companies by 2030? Will it be technology? Will it be an operating model? Or some combination of those factors?

Debra Facktor: The number one way for a company to differentiate itself is through its culture and how it treats people. The environment you create inside your company is a reflection of the service and product that you deliver to your customers and shareholders. A company can have great technologies but then execute poorly because the culture isn’t there. Conversely, a semi-good idea that people think is just so-so—if you put it with the right team that has the passion and ability to innovate—can turn out beyond all expectations.

So I don’t think the differentiator will be a particular technology or business model. It’s all about the people and the experience. If you have a good experience, regardless of what the product or service is, and the people are enjoying what they do while delivering it, that’s what makes for a good company. Companies with a strong, positive, and inclusive culture are the ones that will survive."

The project builds on the work of the manufacturer’s two prior eVTOL demonstration programs: The 2.3-tonne quadcopter CityAirbus Alpha, and the tilt-wing Vahana.

“We really tested the boundaries of speed, of aerodynamics, of noise and, of course, power [with Vahana and CityAirbus Alpha],” Balkiz Sarihan, head of UAM strategy execution and partnerships, told media during an Airbus briefing.

“If you look at the previous two programs, this is a blend of what we consider to be the best of both worlds.”

As with the CityAirbus Alpha, NextGen is a multicopter (with eight instead of four propellers), but it also has a wing. “It is the best structure and architecture for distance, of course, but you have full hover — there is no compromise on this,” said Sarihan.

She said Airbus has designed the aircraft to be simple to certify, simple to maintain, and provide reduced operating costs. As such, there is no tilting mechanism. The two aft rotors are fixed at an angle to generate forward thrust in cruise.

As with any urban air mobility platform, noise is a major consideration. Sarihan said the aircraft is benefitting from research on technologies that have been tested on other Airbus aircraft, such as the Blue Edge canted rotor blades. These blades are said to reduce the sound levels of the Airbus H160 by up to 50 percent. The technology from these is being incorporated into the NextGen’s propellers, said Sarihan.

Airbus is performing noise tests in Paris “to understand not only the level of noise, but the acoustics of the noise to make sure that when our aircraft is in operation, it is blending seamlessly into the communities,” she added.

The company is targeting 70 db at takeoff, and 65 db during cruise flight.

The CityAirbus NextGen’s operating range will be 80 kilometers (50 miles), with a cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) — somewhat conservative figures compared to some of its competitors.

The eVTOL will have an operating range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and a cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). Airbus Image

“They are conservative, but perhaps pragmatic is also a good word,” said Sarihan. “This is not maximum range . . . this is operational range. What we’re talking about is giving our operators, and our cities, and our infrastructure realistic values of where such a vehicle will start — and it’s also based on today’s technology.”

Still, Airbus believes the aircraft meets a design “sweet spot” that will allow it to address 90 percent of all urban missions. And, as new technologies and capabilities come online — such as ever-more powerful batteries, or autonomy technology — the design allows for them to be incorporated.

“The idea is that the front pod can expand without a major design change in the architecture,” said Sarihan.

Operations

NextGen has a capacity of four: a pilot plus three passengers. Airbus firmly believes UAM operations will be piloted to begin with. Sarihan said the cockpit will be “intuitive” and designed to reduce pilot effort.

“The way that we’re designing it, traditional helicopter pilots will be able to fly it,” she said. “In fact, it should be simpler than the operation of a traditional helicopter .”

As well as banking on existing pilots switching to operate UAMs, Airbus is also working on a training program to develop pilots specifically for the technology.

“Almost everyone [in the UAM sector] is going piloted first — with the exception of a few — so, the demand for pilots will increase,” said Sarihan. “I think this is also a good sign for our pilot community, because we get a lot of [people] saying, ‘autonomy will eliminate the need for pilots’ — this is not at all the case. . . . I think we will see in fact an increased demand and many different applications for pilots.”

For passengers, Sarihan said Airbus has designed NextGen with the user experience in mind, providing as much translucency in the cabin as possible. This will help enhance “the joy of experiencing something that is quite new to most of the public,” she said.

The aircraft will be accessed from the front through clamshell doors. This is both an aesthetic and safety consideration, with Airbus mindful of accommodating passengers who may not be used to flying in vertical-lift aircraft.

To explore how the aircraft will fit into urban communities, Airbus is creating vertiports at Pointoise-Cormeilles-en-Vexin Airport (about 35 km/22 miles northwest of Paris), and in Manching, Germany.

The work in the Pointoise sandbox is begin undertaken with long-term partners Groupe ADP and RATP Group (the airport owner and a major infrastructure company).

“We’ve been working with them since the very early days,” said Sarihan. “[We are] mapping out the requirements, mapping out the routes, mapping out where vertiport locations can go, the first missions that will fly in order to make the UAM service as acceptable as possible to the citizens of Paris.”

Regarding the vertiport in Germany, Sarihan said it would be part of a full UAM working system.

“This means an operational environment where the aircraft will fly, a vertiport, a use space and preliminary operations,” she said. “You want to understand the full system, how it will integrate, [and] how the public will use it. What we plan to do here is take this and export it to additional cities where we plan to grow.”

However, while Airbus has an eye to the technology’s future wider incorporation into societies, it is also mindful that a UAM aircraft will need to be able to use existing infratrastructure, too. CityAirbus NextGen is designed to fit onto existing helipads, with a footprint similar to that of an Airbus H145.

Airbus is developing NextGen to meet the certification standards of EASA’s Special Condition VTOL enhanced category, with certification targeted in 2025.

First operating sectors are likely to be emergency medical services and aerial tourism, said Sarihan. “When you think about also this technology of zero emissions, zero noise, and reaching remote places — when we think of ecotourism applications, this is a beautiful way for us to be able to experience these locations without causing any interruption to the local habitat or environment,” said Sarihan.

Airbus will not, however, be the ones operating the CityAirbus NextGen. That task will be left to third parties — the manufacturer believes these companies will likely be from among its existing network of rotary- and fixed-wing operators.

“Airbus does not have the need or the intention to become an operator in this space,” said Sarihan. “We have introduced this to our existing operator network as an extension of their capabilities and their technology.”

She acknowledged that there may be some missions where “it just makes more sense” to use an eVTOL over a helicopter, but said Airbus sees the new technology as being complementary to operator’s existing fleets.

“When we talk to our operators, they really see it in this way as well,” said Sarihan. “This is also why we’ve chosen this configuration, this performance profile for it.”

While many of its competitors are already taking orders for their aircraft, Sarihan said Airbus is focused on maturing the technology for market, while working with a few select partners.

“We are not out there looking for orders or pre-orders on aircraft, which will come in the second half of the decade,” she said.

The ultimate size of the market will be in the thousands — but it will take time to get there, said Sairhan.

“The steps needed to get to that point in time are sequential for us, so this is why we start with value-add missions,” she said. “It’s not going to go overnight to thousands of vehicles flying everywhere — it’s just not feasible.”"

Fleet will need 1,770 new small* and 440 medium and large** aircraft

India will need additional 34,000 pilots; 45,000 technicians by 2040

Hyderabad, March 24, 2022: India will require 2,210 new aircraft over the next 20 years, according to Airbus’ latest India Market Forecast. That fleet could comprise 1,770 new small and 440 medium and large aircraft.

Over the next decade, India will grow to have the largest population in the world, its economy will grow the fastest among the G20 nations, and a burgeoning middle class will spend more on air travel. As a result, passenger traffic in India will grow at 6.2% per annum by 2040, the fastest among the major economies and well above the global average of 3.9%.

India has witnessed an upward trend in the growth of air traffic over the last ten years – with domestic traffic growing almost threefold and international traffic more than doubling. On international routes, India has only about 1/10th of the widebody fleet installed in similar markets, depriving homegrown carriers of a larger share of the profitable long-haul routes now dominated by foreign airlines.

“We have seen India’s domestic market develop strongly with our flagship A320 aircraft. It is time now for Indian carriers to unlock the potential of international travel in and out of India, leveraging the country’s demographic, economic and geographic dividends,” said Rémi Maillard, President and MD, Airbus India & South Asia.

“Whether it is expanding existing airlines or supporting new airlines, there must now be a re-fleeting and rethinking about future-oriented solutions with technology that paves the way for sustainable long-range travel. The A350 is the perfect solution for that,” Maillard said, announcing the India Market Forecast on the opening day of the Wings India air show being held at Hyderabad from March 24 to 27, 2022.

To serve its growing aviation industry, India will require an additional 34,000 pilots and 45,000 technicians by 2040.

The complete Airbus product line comprises the only aircraft specifically designed for the small single-aisle market, the A220, the world’s best-selling A320 Family, the mid-size widebody A330/330neo and the Long-Range Leader, the A350. In the freight market, Airbus aircraft are available with the A320/321P2F (Passenger to Freighter), the A330-200F and A330P2F as well as the world's newest freighter, the A350F.

Upgrades and retrofits breathe new life into Airbus Helicopters' legacy ranges - Airbus,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAzLXVwZ3JhZGVzLWFuZC1yZXRyb2ZpdHMtYnJlYXRoZS1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1sZWdhY3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With HCare Classics, Airbus Helicopters offers a solution that will ensure older ranges of helicopters can continue to perform at the highest level. More than 2,500 aircraft worldwide from the Dauphin, H120, Puma, Gazelle and Alouette families are potentially eligible. Yet military users with large, often older fleets, already recognise upgrades and retrofits as a key lever to ensure an aircraft lives its fullest possible life.

Panther in flight

Military fleets pave the way

Among the recent modernisation programmes, examples include the United Kingdom Royal Air Force’s Puma and the Fennecs and Panthers (36 and 34 aircraft respectively) of the Brazilian Army Aviation (AvEx).

Led by Airbus Helicopters’ Brazilian subsidiary, Helibras, the project means the Fennec and the Panther have gained new avionics, more powerful and fuel efficient engines, and some on-board equipment, offering at least 20 years of additional life. The final batch of retrofitted aircraft was delivered in December 2021, but the renovated versions have been proving their worth since first deliveries began in 2014.

""In its new K2 standard, the Dauphin has adapted to our needs in a remarkable way,"" says Captain Teles Freire of the 3rd Campo Grande Helicopter Battalion. “During the catastrophic fires we experienced in 2020, the aircraft demonstrated its new capabilities in numerous rescue missions. Thanks to the added power, we are able to carry an additional passenger on board.”

In the same spirit, a major retrofit can completely change the life of a modern aircraft, such as the oil industry’s H225s repurposed by Airbus for U.S.-based Air Center Helicopters Inc.’s governmental missions, or the current modernization offers for the Ecureuil and H135, which provide these aircraft with new operational capabilities.

Extending to the civil world

The success of these programmes has shown there is clearly added value in extending modernisation opportunities to civilian operators of out-of-production aircraft. And this is how the recently launched HCare Classics service offer got off the ground at the start of 2020, with the aim of improving support for “legacy” ranges, i.e. helicopter models whose production is now finished, from spare parts supply all the way up to upgrades that can ultimately lead to new uses.

“Our customers were telling us that their older fleets required a level of support we were not providing,” sums up Guillaume Ramirez, head of programme support for light & medium helicopters. ""So it became essential for us to find solutions to make sure these customers can continue to operate these platforms for as long as they wish, with the peace of mind they deserve.""

The offer launched in November 2021 with two distinct phases: the first, in progress, concerns the support of the Puma, Gazelle, H120 and Dauphin helicopters. A second phase, which will begin this year, will concern the oldest versions of aircraft still in production, such as the twin-turbine Ecureuils or the old versions of BK117 and EC135 (not equipped with Helionix).

Like other Airbus Helicopters HCare programmes, HCare Classics is a partnership between the company and the operators, offering tailor-made support. The à la carte service offer can include flight hour contracts, performance commitments, and obsolescence treatment including upgrades, with a dedicated contract manager overseeing all aspects of the relationship.

“In particular, we are committed to securing the supply of spare parts,” explains Nicolas Simon, head of legacy programmes, “which involves re-industrialising them, or supplying second-hand spare parts via qualified wholesalers. The traceability of these parts is essential.”

An innovative approach to sharing the cost of new upgrades

HCare Classics can also include continuous improvement programmes that evaluate potential modifications to extend the life of the in-service fleet or improve operational performance, fleet safety and supportability. One example is an ongoing project aimed at offering new fully digital avionics to the H120 via a cost-sharing approach. “We’re currently proposing the idea to operators and the development will be launched when enough customers commit – a so-called community upgrade offer,” says Nicolas.

Another ambitious programme concerns the MLU (Mid Life Update, or mid-life renovation) of the Dauphin. The helicopter’s production has just ended in Marignane, but 800 units are still flying around the world. This means the Dauphin has an important future in the hands of its operators, provided that it is kept up to date, which involves, for example, the modernisation of the avionics and the dashboard of the N3 models to make it the equivalent of Dauphin N3+.

Nicolas also mentions the creation of user forums specific to Dauphin and H120 users. “These monthly video conferences, accessible live or in replay via the AirbusWorld collaborative customer platform, are an opportunity to communicate on our product policy and to exchange directly with a community of passionate users.”"
Airbus kicks off Franco-Spanish 'Tiger' helo upgrade program – with Germany TBD - Defense News,"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIyLzAzLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1raWNrcy1vZmYtZnJhbmNvLXNwYW5pc2gtdGlnZXItaGVsby11cGdyYWRlLXByb2dyYW0td2l0aC1nZXJtYW55LXRiZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified OCCAR. It is a European intergovernmental agency.

STUTTGART, Germany – Airbus is cleared to build new Tiger attack helicopters for the French and Spanish armies, while Germany’s participation still remains to be seen.

The European intergovernmental procurement agency Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) signed a contract with the aerospace giant to move forward on the awaited upgrade program, Airbus announced in a Wednesday statement.

The Tiger MkIII program includes 60 aircraft total, with 42 earmarked for the French army and 18 for Spain. France also has the option to tack on another 25 helicopters. First flight is expected in 2025, with the first delivery of a French Tiger helicopter due in 2029, with Madrid to receive its first upgraded aircraft in 2030. Work will be performed in Airbus Helicopter facilities in Albacete, Spain; Marignane, France, and Donauwörth, Germany. The total contract worth was not revealed, and OCCAR did not respond to requests for comment by deadline.

The contract also includes the option for Germany to join the program sometime in the future. Bruno Even, chief executive of Airbus Helicopters, hinted in January that the contract may only include France and Spain to start, per reporting by Flight Global. Airbus was “leaving the door open” for Germany to join, he said.

The German Army has reportedly balked at procuring the upgraded Tiger helicopter, amid concern about the low operational readiness of its current fleet. Australia, which also flies the Tiger helicopter, announced in January 2021 that it would buy Boeing-made AH-64 Apaches to replace its Tigers, and it’s possible Berlin could follow suit.

There is no deadline for Berlin to opt in, an Airbus spokesperson told Defense News on Wednesday. Berlin joined Madrid and Paris in signing a trilateral global support contract with Airbus via OCCAR. The spokesperson declined to comment on why Germany isn’t participating from the get-go, but confirmed that the Donauwörth facilities would be involved regardless.

Thales, Safran, and Indra are also involved in the Tiger upgrade program, which will allow the helicopter to perform manned-unmanned teaming, and feature a range of new weapons as well as detection and targeting capabilities. The standard configuration includes a Thales-made avionics suite, a dual-constellation (GPS and Galileo) satellite navigation system, new helmet-mounted displays, and radio and data links meant for manned-unmanned teaming. Safran is providing its Strix NG sights system, along with an inertial navigation system, while Indra will supply new IFF transponders. The Tiger MkIII will be outfitted with a turret gun, laser-guided rockets, and missiles.

The French variant will also include the MBDA MAST-F (future tactical air-to-surface missile) and Mistral 3 air-to-air missile, along with a new battlefield management system by Atos and a self-protection system built by Thales. Indra is providing the battlefield management system and countermeasures for Spain.

The Spanish Tiger will also include new 70mm guided rockets along with a new air-to-ground missile, as well as Link16 and SATCOM functionalities.

Once delivered, the upgraded Tiger MkIII aircraft are expected to remain operational into the 2040s, per industry officials. Australia, France, Spain, and Germany currently operate Tiger helicopters, which were first produced in 1991.

Airbus flies A380 passenger jet on 100% biofuel for the first time - New Atlas,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWJpb2Z1ZWwtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of a broader push on part of the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint, Airbus has conducted the first ever flight of its giant A380 jumbo jet using 100 percent biofuel. This is the third Airbus aircraft to fly using the sustainable fuel made up of primarily cooking oil, as the company works to certify the technology by the end of the decade.

The aircraft featured in the groundbreaking flight is the Airbus ZEROe Demonstrator, an A380 adapted for use as a flying testbed and one the company plans to also use to test out hydrogen combustion jet engines.

For this particular outing, the aircraft was loaded up with 27 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), made mostly with cooking oil and waste fats. This powered the A380's Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine across a three-hour test flight out of the Blagnac Airport in Toulouse France on March 28, with a second flight then carrying it all the way to Nice Airport on March 29.

This demonstration follows successful flights of the Airbus A350 and the Airbus A319neo single-aisle plane using SAF last year. Using the biofuel to now power the world's largest passenger jet marks another step forward for the testing program, as Airbus aspires to bring the world's first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

Airbus isn't alone in pursuing cleaner aviation with the help of cooking oil. Way back in 2012, Boeing made the first biofuel-powered Pacific crossing in its 787 Dreamliner using a mix of regular jet fuel and fuel derived mainly from cooking oil. In 2014, it even opened up a biofuel production plant in China based to ensure a consistent supply.

In emphasizing the potential of SAF, Airbus refers to the Waypoint 2050 report put together by collaboration of aviation experts to outline how the industry can achieve decarbonization by midway through the century. That report identifies the deploying of SAF as the single largest opportunity to meet these goals, with the potential to deliver between 53 and 71 percent of the required carbon reductions.

As it stands, all of Airbus' aircraft are certified to fly with a 50 percent SAF-kerosene blend. Airbus aims to achieve certification for 100 percent SAF use by the end of the decade.

Galileo 2nd generation satellites ready to navigate into the future - Airbus,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1nYWxpbGVvLTJuZC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtcmVhZHktdG8tbmF2aWdhdGUtaW50by10aGUtZnV0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus satellite design passes important project milestone

Preparing for industrialised manufacturing concept

Friedrichshafen, 08 March 2022 - Airbus has successfully completed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for its system concept for the second generation Galileo navigation satellites. During this important milestone, Airbus' proposed preliminary design and the customer's system requirements have been fully reviewed and agreed.

This paves the way for further verification, acceptance and qualification at equipment and module level. Verification at payload level is already in full swing, with the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the satellite structure also due shortly.

In parallel, the Airbus site in Friedrichshafen, on Lake Constance, is preparing for an industrialised production line for currently six second-generation Galileo satellites. The satellite integration centre, is being completely upgraded to meet current and future requirements for efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and secure production for the Galileo 2nd generation satellites. Galileo second generation is a key milestone in European satellite navigation services that European citizens and billions of users around the world will benefit from, powered by Airbus know-how brought to the project by over 200 highly skilled space engineers. The first Galileo second generation are planned to be launched in 2024.

The world of navigation is changing, driven by rapidly emerging and changing user needs (availability and reliability), a growing number of security threats (jamming and spoofing) and the evolution of other navigation systems. The new batch of Galileo spacecraft built by Airbus is the answer to this changing context. It will make the Galileo service more accurate, secure and dependable, and adaptable over its lifetime spanning two decades.

Weighing around 2.3 tons, each satellite is designed to operate for about 15 years. The state-of-the-art and all-electric medium-Earth orbit (MEO) platform from Airbus, reuses flight proven building blocks from our Telecoms and Earth Observation programmes, taking advantage of a unique combination of heritage and in orbit experience. The flexible and modular navigation payload solution with future growth capability is also based on telecom elements for signal generation.

Galileo is managed and funded by the European Union. The European Commission, ESA and EUSPA have signed an agreement by which ESA acts as design authority and system development prime on behalf of the Commission and EUSPA as the exploitation and operation manager of Galileo.

During the ceremony, Airbus confirmed that Volotea, the Barcelona-based airline, is the first to recruit its Airbus pilot cadets.

The move by Volotea to recruit eleven of Airbus’ newly graduated pilot cadets is an endorsement of the quality of Airbus’ Ab-Initio Training Programme, which opened its doors in 2019. The programme equips cadets with the skills and mind-set required to become an “operationally-ready pilot” focusing on the all-important development of key pilot technical and behavioural competencies. Currently in the final stages of their pilot training, the Airbus cadets will be joining Volotea and flying as commercial airline pilots from April-May this year.

“This is a very important day for Volotea, as we are taking cadets directly from the Airbus Flight Academy Europe for the first time. We’re all very excited by it as we know the programme quality is of a very high standard, adapting perfectly to Volotea´s training philosophy, said Carlos Muñoz, CEO Volotea. Our company keeps on growing year after year our Airbus fleet, and we’re going to be needing many more pilots. We certainly hope this is the beginning of a very successful long-term partnership with the Airbus Flight Academy benefiting many young pilots.”

The inauguration of the new facility provides AFAE, which is the first flight school to deliver the Airbus Pilot Cadet Training Programme in Europe, with an increased capacity to train up-to 200 pilot cadets at any one time. The site, which spans 4.7 hectares,includes a new building of approx. 3200m² which will be dedicated to the training of aspiring pilots with 14 classrooms and briefing rooms, a simulator hall, an auditorium and a restaurant.

By enlarging its ab-initio training base, Airbus reaffirms its longstanding commitment to support its airline customers in anticipating and preparing for the future. In helping to train the pilots of tomorrow, a demand now estimated to be around 550,000 over the next 20 years*, Airbus is ensuring the commercial aircraft industry is ready for air traffic recovery in the 2023-2025 timeframe and the years beyond.

The move to a new campus is also the opportunity for AFAE to commit to and align with Airbus’ global approach to sustainability. A first step was the achievement of ISO 14001 certification for the site in 2021. AFAE now turns its efforts to focusing on a reduction of CO₂ emissions of its training aircraft fleet -an order for the more fuel efficient, quieter Elixir light aircraft is ongoing to complement the current Cirrus fleet, as well as ensuring a decarbonised environmental footprint in terms of its physical sites and supply chain.

Going forward AFAE stands ready to adapt its operations in line with Airbus’ long term zero-emission ambition, all the while ensuring that it maintains the comprehensive and innovative approach to training that Airbus has been renowned for over the past 50 years, via the regular introduction of the latest technologies and learning concepts, including environmental education from Day1.

The Airbus Pilot Cadet Training Programme is open to high school graduates over 18 years old worldwide. Candidates will undergo online and on-site screening tests before being eligible for training which will include 750+ hours of ground school, plus 200 hours of practical (flight and simulator) training.

Review: SAS Business Class Airbus A350-900 (CPH-MIA) - One Mile at a Time,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3Mvc2FzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLWEzNTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After an amazing trip to Oman, it was time for the last segment back to the United States, in Scandinavian Airlines’ A350-900 business class from Copenhagen to Miami.

I was looking forward to this flight, as I hadn’t flown SAS’ A350 business class before. Furthermore, I’ve only ever flown SAS’ long haul business class once (on the A330), and it wasn’t a good experience. I was curious to see how the airline would do this time around.

I’ve gotta say, SAS really impressed me — while there are a few areas for improvement, the crew was friendly, the seats were comfortable, the food was good, and business class passengers get free Wi-Fi. This might just rank in my top five transatlantic business class products.

How I booked my SAS business class ticket

I booked the return itinerary through Air Canada Aeroplan, and managed to ticket the following in business class for 105,000 Aeroplan points plus $55.25 in taxes and fees:

02/27 TK775 Muscat to Istanbul departing 1:20AM arriving 6:05AM

02/27 TK1781 Istanbul to Copenhagen departing 11:50AM arriving 1:10PM

03/01 SK953 Copenhagen to Miami departing 9:35AM arriving 2:05PM

One of the awesome things about Aeroplan is that you can add a stopover to a one-way award for just 5,000 points, so I was able to add one of those here, so I could spend a couple of days in Copenhagen.

SAS business class boarding

After visits to both the SAS Lounge and Eventyr Lounge, it was time to head to the departure gate for our flight to Miami. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 9:35AM, and boarding was scheduled to start at 8:50AM, 45 minutes before departure.

The flight was departing from gate E129, which was a surprising distance from the Eventyr Lounge, even though we were already in the non-Schengen area. We walked really far, and the terminal was also totally deserted.

8:50AM came and went, and there was no announcement about boarding. As a matter of fact, the crew only showed up five minutes after that, at 8:55AM. A moment later the gate agents advised that there was one flight attendant missing, and they were working on finding a replacement, but didn’t have a sense of how long that would take.

At 9:20AM the purser came into the gate area and made an announcement. He explained the situation in greater detail, and said that one flight attendant had called in sick last minute, and a replacement flight attendant should be arriving any minute.

He was extremely professional, and explained that the flight attendant that would be showing up shortly is helping us and not the reason for the delay, so we shouldn’t blame her. Rather he suggested we cheer when she arrives.

Sure enough at 9:30AM the flight attendant showed up, and it was clear that she was rushing to get there, as she was out of breath. She wasn’t just casually strolling with an iced coffee in her hand. Kudos to the crew for the professionalism with which this was handled.

Boarding began roughly two minutes after that last flight attendant arrived, with business class passengers being invited to board first.

SAS A350-900 business class cabin & seats

Scandinavian Airlines’ Airbus A350-900s have a total of 40 business class seats, in a 1-2-1 configuration. There’s a forward cabin (between the first and second set of doors) with eight rows of seats, and a rear cabin (behind the second set of doors) with two rows of seats.

SAS has Vantage XL seats in business class, which you’ll find on quite a few airlines, including Philippine Airlines, Qantas, RwandAir, and more.

Scandinavian Airlines A350-900 business class cabin

In these configurations, seats are staggered in alternating rows to maximize efficiency. This allows the footwell for a particular seat to be to the side of the seat in front. Some people may prefer to sit in the center section if traveling with someone, though in reality you still won’t be that close to the other person (there are no “honeymoon” seats here, as you’d find in some other configurations).

Scandinavian Airlines business class seats A350-900

The differences between seats are more noticeable in the window seats. In odd numbered rows, the window seats are closer to the aisle, so they don’t offer as much privacy, and it’s harder to look out the window.

Scandinavian Airlines business class seats A350-900

In even numbered rows, the window seats are closer to the windows, which would be my preferred seats, given that they offer the most privacy and the best views. I assigned myself seat 8A (row eight is the last row in the forward business class cabin).

SAS business class seats A350-900

Each seat has an 18.5″ seatback television, plus a literature pocket and coat hook next to it.

Along the other side of the seat is a “counter” where you can place things during the flight. There’s also an exposed storage compartment that has a hook for headphones, plus a reading light, the seat controls, entertainment controller, headphone jack, and outlets (USB and AC power).

SAS business class seat functions

In addition to the more customizable seat control positions, there are a few pre-set positions you can control from a panel underneath the side table.

The tray table could be extended from the armrest on the right side of the seat, and it could be folded over in half.

One issue with these staggered configurations can be that the footwell is sometimes on the small side, especially if you have big feet. Fortunately SAS’ Vantage XL seats have reasonably big footwells, so I didn’t find space to be an issue when trying to sleep.

SAS business class seat footwell

Each seat also had the latest generation Airbus overhead consoles, including a reading light and seatbelt sign. Unfortunately there were no individual air nozzles.

The two lavatories for business class passengers were located behind the cabin. They were quite no frills, and weren’t particularly big, didn’t have windows, and didn’t have any exciting amenities.

SAS business class amenities

Waiting at each seat upon boarding was a pillow, blanket, and mattress sheet. I found the bedding to be quite good — the pillow was quite large, the blanket was cozy without being warm, and it was nice to have a mattress pad (though perhaps it was more of a sheet, as it doesn’t offer much additional padding).

SAS business class pillow & blanket

There was also an amenity kit waiting at each seat.

The contents were limited, and included a dental kit, socks, eyeshades, earplugs, face moisturizer, and lip balm.

Then there were headphones, which had a mild noise canceling feature.

About 10 minutes after boarding, pre-departure drinks were served, with the choice of champagne, orange juice, or water. I selected the champagne, which was served in proper glassware.

SAS departure from Copenhagen

Boarding was complete by 9:50AM, about 15 minutes after it started. It was an efficient boarding process, thanks largely to the flight not being too full — business class and premium economy were around 75% full, while economy seemed to be around 50% full.

Once everyone was settled in the purser made his welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 10 hours. At 10AM we began our pushback, at which point the safety video was screened.

Pushing back at Copenhagen Airport

We started taxiing to the runway by 10:05AM — it was a pretty quiet day at the airport, without much movement. There weren’t all that many interesting planes, perhaps aside from an Air China A330.

Taxiing Copenhagen Airport

Air China A330 Copenhagen Airport

I didn’t just look out the window, but also kept an eye on the awesome tail camera that SAS’ A350s have. Gosh I could watch this all day. By 10:15AM we were cleared for takeoff on runway 22R.

We had a smooth takeoff roll and gradual climb out — what a gorgeous wing and engine view I had from my seat!

SAS A350 entertainment & Wi-Fi

As we climbed out I browsed the entertainment selection. While SAS’ entertainment system is pretty responsive, the screen has a frustrating amount of glare, and there don’t seem to be any ways to adjust the settings to improve that. So when the cabin lights are turned on, expect to be dealing with quite a bit of glare.

SAS A350 entertainment system

The entertainment selection was okay, but below average. There were a total of 87 TV shows and 57 movies, which isn’t a huge selection. In particular, I wish there were more than one episode of each TV show, since it can be fun to get into a series sometimes.

As an avgeek I did appreciate the shows on the entertainment about SAS, including how pre-flight inspections are performed, how to overcome fear of flying, etc. Unfortunately each of these only lasted a few minutes at most, so I exhausted that selection pretty quickly.

SAS A350 entertainment system

For most of the flight I simply had the tail camera or the map feature on, which is perfect entertainment, as far as I’m concerned.

Whatever shortcomings SAS has with the entertainment system is more than made up for with Wi-Fi. SAS offers business class passengers complimentary Wi-Fi on one device. Speeds were even excellent.

SAS A350 Wi-Fi system

To access the free Wi-Fi you have to provide your first and last name plus your booking reference, so make sure you have that handy when boarding your flight.

SAS A350 Wi-Fi system

If you don’t have access to free Wi-Fi (or want to buy access for a second device), the cost is a reasonable 199DKK (~$17) for the entire flight without data caps.

SAS A350 Wi-Fi system

There aren’t many airlines offering free Wi-Fi with no data caps across the Atlantic, so this is a huge competitive advantage for SAS, in my opinion.

SAS A350 business class bed

I didn’t sleep on this 10 hour daytime flight, but I did test out the bed mode for comfort. I found the bed to be quite comfortable — the seat padding was good, and I found the seat to be spacious, even though I’m a side sleeper who likes to bend my knees.

One other interesting note about cabin ambiance. The crew never turned off the lights in the cabin during the flight, but rather the below mood lighting was as dark as it got. I find that most airlines turn off lights on longer flights (even if daytime) so that people sleep, though as someone who wanted to stay up, I kind of liked this level of lighting.

SAS business class lunch

The meal service started quickly after takeoff. Oddly there were no menus in business class, but rather an announcement was made over the PA informing passengers of the meal choices. Service started with tablecloths being distributed.

SAS business class tablecloth

After that carts were rolled down the aisle with drinks. I ordered a glass of sparkling water as well as an Italian white wine, which were served with salted cashews. The flight attendant working my aisle had the chef uniform on. I find SAS’ execution of the onboard chef concept to be a bit odd — it’s not like Turkish Airlines, where there’s a specific function the chef seems to perform.

SAS business class lunch — drinks and nuts

The entire meal, from starter to dessert, was served covered and on a single tray.

SAS business class lunch

On the plus side, I found the food quality to be excellent. The starter was described as smoked cod loin with pickled beets and seaweed chunks.

Then for the main course there was the choice of steak with cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes, or Faroe Island salmon with jersualem artichoke sauce, and organic pasta with mushroom sauce.

SAS business class lunch

For dessert there was a dark chocolate tart. After the meal a coffee trolley was rolled down the aisle, so I had a cup of coffee to accompany my dessert.

SAS business class lunch — dessert

While the lack of menus and one tray presentation aren’t ideal, the food quality as such was very good. I enjoyed the starter, main, and dessert, much more than the food I’ve had on most other transatlantic flights.

The entire meal service was also efficient, and within 90 minutes of takeoff all meals were fully cleared.

SAS business class snack & pre-landing meal

There was a self-serve bar in the galley between the two business class cabins. This had several types of drinks, as well as packaged snacks, ranging from nuts, to chocolates, to chips, to gummy bears. Of course other drinks were available directly from the crew.

SAS A350 business class self-serve bar

Roughly at the halfway point of the flight, the crew distributed packaged sandwiches, with the choice of either cheese or ham. I had a cheese sandwich, and it was reasonably tasty.

SAS business class snack

I had a couple of cups of coffee during the flight, which were served in paper cups.

About 90 minutes before landing the pre-arrival snack was served. This consisted of a chicken sandwich on rye bread, and was quite tasty. This was served with a side of fruit and a box of chocolates.

SAS business class pre-landing meal

Coffee & tea were served after the meal, so I had a cup of coffee.

This is probably what impressed me most compared to my last long haul flight on SAS. Unlike my last SAS business class flight, the crew on this flight was lovely. The flight attendants were friendly, attentive, and seemed genuinely happy to be working. Then again, maybe that was partly because they were flying from Northern Europe to Florida in winter, which I imagine might have something to do with it. 😉

SAS approach to Miami

At around 1:35PM local time the captain came on the PA to advise us that we’d be landing in Miami in around 45 minutes. Roughly 15 minutes later we began our descent, and at that point the cabin was already prepared for landing.

Map while approaching Miami

View approaching Miami

As usual, the views on approach to Miami were gorgeous, given that we were landing into the west. We had great views of Miami Beach, the Venetian Islands, Brickell, etc.

You’ve gotta love the traffic at Miami Airport, from an Icelandair Boeing 757 (operating charter flights to Cuba), to a Boliviana de Aviacion Boeing 767.

We ended up arriving at our gate at around 2:30PM, just a bit behind schedule. We were treated to a beautiful view of the SAS A350 while walking toward immigration.

Bottom line

Based on my previous SAS long haul experience, I came into this flight with low expectations. Fortunately they were exceeded significantly. The Vantage XL seats are among the most comfortable transatlantic business class seats offered by a European airline. Add in the tasty food, friendly service, free Wi-Fi, and general comfort of the A350, and this was a fantastic experience.

I’d say the main room for improvement is with the entertainment selection and perhaps the introduction of a menu and drink list, so people can more easily figure out what they’re ordering. But those are minor details in the grand scheme of things, and I’d choose SAS again on a long haul flight in a heartbeat.

Thanks so much for following along with this journey, and stay tuned for the next trip report, launching shortly!

New report demonstrates Airbus' significant contribution to the UK economy - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAzLW5ldy1yZXBvcnQtZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLWFpcmJ1cy1zaWduaWZpY2FudC1jb250cmlidXRpb24tdG8tdGhlLXVrLWVjb25vbXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In addition to setting out Airbus’ full economic footprint in the UK in terms of its gross value-added contribution to GDP, the level of employment it supports across the country, tax revenues, and investment, the report analyses how the company contributes to broader national initiatives such as the Levelling Up plan, net zero and promoting social value activities.





Operating from more than 25 sites across the UK, Airbus is the largest civil aerospace company in the country, the biggest civil aerospace exporter, Britain’s largest space company, the biggest supplier of large aircraft to the Royal Air Force and is responsible for around 50% of the UK’s civil helicopter fleet.



Put simply, the UK is important to Airbus and Airbus is important to the UK, and this survey, spanning data collated over the last three years, outlines how Airbus remains a vital part of the UK’s economic, societal and environmental landscape, even when accounting for the impact of COVID-19 on the wider aviation sector.



We are steadfast in our commitment to the UK, and will continue to invest in our workforce, in the UK supply chain, research and development, and in the technologies that will play a vital role in limiting man-made carbon emissions, providing sustainable aviation that will benefit the entire planet.



As our business looks towards recovery and growth following the pandemic, we continue to view Airbus’ strong and enduring relationship with the United Kingdom as a vital element of Airbus’ ongoing success and we are committed to continuing to deepen our ties over the years and decades to come.

John Harrison, Group General Counsel and Chairman of Airbus UK

The report highlights that, despite the well documented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global aviation sector, Airbus continues to be a significant contributor to the UK’s economy. When looking at Airbus’ contribution from the start of 2019 to the end of 2020, it found that, in terms of GDP, employment, supply chain, tax, and investment, Airbus continues to play a crucial role in the UK’s wider economic performance.

In terms of key highlights, Oxford Economics’ analysis found that:

Airbus directly and indirectly supported a £5.6 billion contribution to UK GDP in 2020

In 2020, £1 in every £92 earned by UK firms from exported goods were products manufactured by Airbus.

In 2020, in addition to its own workforce, Airbus supported approximately 86,400 jobs.

Airbus’ UK supply chain includes hundreds of small- and medium-sized businesses, with SME’s accounting for 30% of all Airbus’ UK suppliers.

Airbus invested £260 million in research and development in 2020.

The UK has a world leading aerospace sector, with Airbus playing a central role in this success. The ground-breaking tech that Airbus and its partners are developing will help secure the future of flight in the next generation aircraft of tomorrow.



This report illustrates the positive impact Airbus has had on communities across the UK, underpinned by an extensive supply chain with a strong focus on innovation – driving growth and providing high-skilled jobs, apprenticeships and careers.

33,000 new pilots and 43,000 technicians need to be trained over the next 20 years

Miami, 10 March 2022 – In the next 20 years the Latin America region will require 2,460 new passenger and freighter aircraft, out of which more than half will help meet rising demand, while 44 percent will support the replacement of older and less fuel efficient aircraft, improving the CO2 efficiency of the fleets operated in the region.

Passenger traffic in Latin America almost tripled since 2002 and is expected to double over the next two decades. Travel rates per capita in Colombia, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil lead this passenger traffic growth. In Chile travel rates per capita will triple. The increase in air travel is being fueled by population and economic growth throughout Latin America.

Domestic and international passenger traffic in Latin America is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years by a factor of 2.3, representing an annual growth rate of 3.9%. By 2040, additional traffic will be driven by domestic markets with a 4.2 percent annual growth rate per year. Both intra-Latin America (flights within Latin America) and Caribbean and Latin America-Rest of the World traffic (routes between Latin America and other regions of the world) will grow by 3.5 percent per year.

The region’s in-service fleet will double from the 1,440 aircraft in-service today to 2,820 in the next two decades. Out of the new passenger and freighter aircraft needed in Latin America and the Caribbean, 2,170 will be for the small segment, 190 for medium aircraft and 100 for large aircraft.

To fly this growing fleet, there will be a forecasted need for 33,000 new pilots and 43,000 technicians to be trained over the next 20 years in Latin America, representing a growth in the Latin America services market from $5.5 billion in 2021 to $19 billion in 2040.

Latin America and the Caribbean is experiencing an air traffic recovery thanks to the lifting of travel restrictions and increase in vaccination rates. The region's air traffic is expected to reach 2019 levels between 2023 and 2025.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, Airbus has sold over 1,100 aircraft and has a backlog of over 500, with more than 700 in operation throughout the region, representing almost 60 percent market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured approximately 70 percent of net orders in the region."
#NextSpace: Mission to Mars - Airbus,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAzLW5leHRzcGFjZS1taXNzaW9uLXRvLW1hcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Very few people get to work on things that leave our planet. Paul Meacham is one of them: The European rover he and his Airbus colleagues built will drive on Mars, searching for signs of life.

There Paul was, all garbed up in his lab coat, cap and goggles. “This is really it”, he remembers thinking one day as he was preparing ESA’s Mars rover Rosalind Franklin for testing in the cleanroom. “This is the flight rover that will actually go to the Red Planet, drive around on it and look for life.” Working on such cutting-edge projects can have that humbling effect on you, but it is also incredibly fulfilling, says Paul: “Not many people get to do exciting stuff and work on things that leave this planet.”

Paul and his Airbus colleagues have spent a number of years ensuring Rosalind Franklin will operate meticulously 350 million km away from Earth. As the Engineering Manager Paul has been coordinating the technical response to issues the team encountered during the testing of the rover. “It is critical to demonstrate that the rover will work correctly the day it arrives on Mars, so various tests, such as thermal cycling, electromagnetic compatibility and mechanical vibration, have to prove this long before the rover ever leaves Earth”, Paul explains.

It is this problem solving that Paul enjoys most about his job - next to witnessing how Rosalind Franklin came to life in the past 13 years he has been working on her. “To me, she seems almost human,” Paul says. That is mostly due to the twin 3D navigation cameras that are attached to the rover’s mast. Not only do they look like eyes, they actually serve as the eyes of the ESA scientists back on Earth: helping them to take images, get data on the surface texture and atmosphere and assign target destinations for the rover. Apart from that Rosalind Franklin moves around completely autonomously.

“We are really pushing the envelope of what is technologically possible”, Paul says. And that is also something people back on Earth will benefit from. This is particularly true of the autonomous navigation system, which runs on a very low power computer and could be used for applications in the nuclear and automotive industry, or even something as simple as a robot to mow grass. Technology from previous Mars missions is now used to detect tuberculosis in Africa.

“Doing things that have never been done before is what makes me get up each morning”, Paul says. And there will be plenty of reasons to do so in the future. From 2028 onwards, Airbus’ second rover will collect Mars samples that will be brought back to our planet by an Airbus-built spacecraft in 2031. This will be the first time ever scientists can study rock samples from Mars.

For the past seven years, Reuter has grown the Volocopter team from a five-person startup to around 500 employees in Germany and Singapore. Over the years, the company has completed more than 1,000 public and private flight tests with its eVTOL aircraft, raising a total of US$579 million in funds.

It recently closed on US$170 million in its Series E funding round, which the company said will be used to help certify its VoloCity eVTOL aircraft and begin commercial operations in time for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Speaking of Reuter’s announced departure in September, Stefan Klocke, chair of Volocopter’s advisory board said, “We fully respect and understand his personal decision and are happy to keep him in the family as a friend and shareholder.”

Hoke left Airbus in September after spending nearly six years at the aerospace company. Prior to Airbus, he spent almost 11 years at German technology company Siemens, serving in various executive roles. Hoke said he believes his extensive experience working at big tech companies will help the Volocopter team “monetize on the leading market position Volocopter has achieved under Florian’s leadership. Volocopter’s product line-up, its certification progress, team spirit, and ecosystem approach put us in a unique competitive position.”

Volocopter is developing a series of eVTOL aircraft, which includes a two-seat VoloCity, as well as a larger passenger-carrying VoloConnect, and an uncrewed VoloDrone for cargo transport. The company said it is the only eVTOL developer that has obtained design, as well as production organization approvals, from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."

STAT MedEvac orders 10 new Airbus H135 helicopters - Airbus,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1zdGF0LW1lZGV2YWMtb3JkZXJzLTEwLW5ldy1haXJidXMtaDEzNS1oZWxpY29wdGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dallas, March 8, 2022 – STAT MedEvac, an Airbus customer for nearly 40 years, has committed to ordering 10 new H135 helicopters as part of a fleet renewal initiative for its air medical operations. STAT’s total Airbus fleet, a mix of H135 and H145 family aircraft, operates out of 18 bases.

“We’ve been flying Airbus products since we began our operations, and couldn’t imagine it any other way,” said Jim Houser, CEO of STAT Medevac. “Going back to the first North American EC135, we’ve been a key operator of the H135 throughout its upgrades and evolutions, and the H135 has continuously met our mission requirements, helping us provide high-quality care in the safest and most efficient way possible. We look forward to renewing our fleet with these 10 new aircraft and we thank Airbus for being such a supportive and fantastic partner all these years.”

STAT MedEvac has flown Airbus helicopters since commencing operations in 1985 and has a longstanding history with the H135 family – it was the first air ambulance program in North America to operate the EC135 in 1997, the first single-pilot IFR program with an EC135 in U.S. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS), the launch customer of the latest H135 variant in North America and the launch customer of the Helionix-equipped version in 2019. The Pennsylvania-based critical care transport provider is the clinical arm for the Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania, and is also the largest single branded, non-profit medical transport system in the Eastern United States.

“STAT MedEvac has become a key part of the H135’s success in the air medical market, and Airbus is extremely proud to support the life-saving missions they carry out every single day,” said Romain Trapp, President of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and Head of the North American region. “With the latest evolution of this proven platform, Airbus aims to continue to meet our EMS customers’ evolving needs to use their helicopters as flying hospitals, and to be able to do so with the latest technologies that reduce pilot workload and increase safety all around. Thank you to the entire team at STAT for your trust in Airbus, and for the incredible work that you do.”

The H135 is the market leader in emergency medical services (EMS) worldwide and can be fitted with a wide range of EMS configurations, providing direct access and ample room for patient care. With the lowest operating and maintenance costs of any twin-engine, the proven H135 family of aircraft include Airbus’ Helionix avionics suite and has recently received an alternate gross weight increase for an additional 265lbs of useful load.

Airbus Helicopters is the leading provider of helicopters to the air medical transport industry, providing some 55% of the 2,600 EMS helicopters flying in the world today and more than half of all new air medical helicopters sold in the last decade in the U.S.

Airbus sees A350 as its ticket to ride as it tries to woo India | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvbWFyLzI3L2FpcmJ1cy1zZWVzLWEzNTAtYXMtaXRzLXRpY2tldC10by1yaWRlLWFzLWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has tried for years to find a new customer for its bigger jets in India, the world's fastest-growing aviation market before covid-19 shattered travel. Two of its previous buyers went bankrupt, while another was sold, giving arch rival Boeing a firm foothold in the South Asian nation's market for transcontinental planes.

Remi Maillard, the chief of Airbus's Indian unit, reckons things are about to change. The European planemaker has doubled down on efforts to sell its A350 jets to local carriers in recent days, with a specific eye on formerly state-run Air India Ltd., which under its new owners -- conglomerate Tata Group -- needs to revamp its fleet of Boeing 777 jets.

""We believe the A350 will trigger a tectonic shift, a change of paradigm in long-haul travel that matches the aspiration of India and its people,"" Maillard told reporters in the southern city of Hyderabad, where top aviation executives and government officials gathered last week for the Wings India airshow. ""The A350 will play a strategic role in this transformation.""

Airbus flew an A350 to three major Indian cities over three days, showcasing the jet to potential customers and media. On Tuesday, Ratan Tata, the Tata Group patriarch who was recently named chairman of Air India, also toured the plane, images posted on social media show.

Boeing and Airbus are in talks with the new owners of Air India about an order for a raft of new jets, Bloomberg News reported last month. Those discussions involve both A350-900s and 787-9 Dreamliners.

Air India has a fleet of 16 Boeing 777 jets, with an average age of more than 12 years, according to Planespotters.net. Of its relatively newer fleet of 27 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, seven are grounded.

In India, ""widebody fleets have remained mostly stagnant for 20 years while single aisle fleets multiplied by a factor of six,"" Maillard said. ""The growth in the domestic market for the last 20 years will be seen in the international market now.""

Airbus, formed through an amalgamation of European planemakers in 1970, previously sold its A380 superjumbos to liquor baron Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines, but the airline collapsed under a pile of debt and the order was canceled. Jet Airways India, which operated A330 jets, also went belly up in 2019, while Air India returned its A330s last decade.

Airbus's lack of success selling widebody planes to Indian carriers contrasts sharply with what it's achieved with narrowbody aircraft. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation, is the world's biggest customer for A320neo jets, and the local affiliates of Singapore Airlines and AirAsia all operate A320 family. Tata Group are the majority owners in both of those ventures.

IndiGo, which once considered buying the international operations of Air India, also held conversations with Airbus and Boeing to buy widebody planes, although that plan was later shelved. Budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd. held talks too but has so far stayed away from placing an order.

India will need 2,210 aircraft by 2040, Airbus predicted last week. While most of them will be smaller jets, 440 planes will be capable of flying long distances, and the market will grow at the world's fastest pace of 6.3% annually for the period, it said.

""The center of gravity of aviation is moving east and is on the high trajectory to land in India,"" Maillard said. ""The time is right for India to turn into an international hub. Long haul will grow massively for the next 10 years due to India's geographic dividend, demographic dividend and economic dividend."""
Engine supply chain shortages could thwart Airbus and Boeing production plans - Flightglobal,"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2VuZ2luZXMvZW5naW5lLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1zaG9ydGFnZXMtY291bGQtdGh3YXJ0LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcGxhbnMvMTQ3NzMzLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the aerospace industry works toward recovery in 2022, there exists within the turbofan manufacturing supply chain an unmistakable sense of deja vu.

Think back to the years immediately before the pandemic. Back then, engine makers were struggling to keep pace as Airbus and Boeing worked to increase assembly of narrowbody jets. Shortages, notably of cast and forged engine components, were holding things up.

Such troubles evaporated amid the pandemic as airlines grounded jets and deferred deliveries of new Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies.

But the same familiar engine supply shortages have emerged again as the industry awakens from the downturn.

Aerospace executives and analysts are again raising alarm. They say long-standing engine supply issues are being made worse by new Covid-era pressures, among them inflation and lack of skilled workers.

Such factors are bearing down on the companies that make engine components, raising uncertainty about how fast suppliers will be able to produce the complex, labour-intensive components needed by companies like Pratt & Whitney and CFM International.

Asked on 26 January about Boeing’s top supply constraints, chief executive David Calhoun responded: “The old engine questions, and castings and forgings… That has already constrained our outlook.”

The entire turbofan chain faces a tall task: keep pace as Airbus and Boeing try to significantly hike production.

“The OEMs have got some wishes on build rate… The chances of making this ramp up are pretty small,” Cliff Collier, principal at aerospace advisory Charles Edwards Management Consulting, said in February at PNAA Advance, an aerospace suppliers’ conference near Seattle.

FAMILIAR PROBLEMS

Collier was among many attendees who warned of supply chain struggles.

The old, familiar casting and forging shortages are back, aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels, managing partner of AeroDynamic Advisory, said at the event.

Before the 737 Max grounding in March 2019, Boeing was cranking out 737s at a brisk clip of 52 monthly. Likewise, Airbus in 2019 delivered an average of nearly 54 A320-family jets monthly. Business was booming, and both airframers were eyeing further rate gains.

But P&W, which makes PW1100Gs for some A320neo-family aircraft, and CFM, which makes Leap turbofans for both A320neos and exclusively for 737 Max narrowbodies, were struggling to keep up.

“Trying to get additional capacity into the supply chain on the casting front is very, very difficult,” Gregory Hayes, chief executive of P&W parent Raytheon Technologies, said in 2019. At the time, Hayes was boss of P&W’s then-parent United Technologies.

In 2019, P&W shipped 746 large commercial aircraft engines, while CFM, a joint venture of Safran and GE Aviation, sold 1,736 Leap powerplants.

The pandemic and the Max grounding in the case of the Leap sent those numbers tumbling. P&W shipped 546 large commercial engines in 2020, and 623 in 2021, while CFM sold 815 Leap turbofans in 2020 and 845 in 2021.

As work dried up, some small suppliers of engine components closed shop. Others moved away from aerospace to produce components for other sectors, says Alex Krutz, managing director of Patriot Industrial Partners, an aerospace and defence advisory.

Many companies survived the downturn thanks partly to government aid, analysts note. Firms also slashed workforces and shuttered operations.

Those included Berkshire Hathaway-owned Precision Castparts, an Oregon-based producer of critically important forged and cast engine components, including airfoils, fan frames, and turbine shrouds. In 2020, Precision said it was cutting 40% of its workforce. Another supplier of metallic engine components, Pittsburgh-based Howmet Aerospace, also laid off staff amid the pandemic. Other companies throughout the engine supply chain did the same.

“They laid off people, and now they have to bring them back,” Krutz says.

That is no easy task.

“You don’t hire people to make… turbine blades off the street,” adds Michaels.

ASSEMBLY RATES

As before, the turbofan chain faces the incredibly difficult challenge of keeping pace as Airbus and Boeing once again work to increase their assembly rates.

The US airframer wants to bring 737 production to 31 jets monthly this year. Airbus has laid out more-ambitious plans. After delivering about 40 A320neo-family jets per month in 2021, the European airframer wants to hit monthly-rate 65 by summer 2023.

“It’s absolutely fantastic news that these build rates are going up… What a great problem to have,” says Gary Lowe of Thyssenkrupp Aerospace’s North American business. But, he warns: “It’s going to be a lot more lumpy and problematic than many people realise.”

Michaels suspects more suppliers might fold. “You will see more failures in the next 18 months than you saw in the previous 18 months,” he says. “It is harder to ramp up than to ramp down.”

Aerospace executives are also calling out concern.

Speaking during Raytheon’s 2021 earnings call on 25 January, Hayes warned of supply chain and labour troubles.

“We see some labour shortages with skilled positions,” he says, adding that Raytheon faces “its share of supply disruptions”. Hayes cited tight supply of “castings” due to a “shortage of welders”.

Safran has raised concern about the aerospace supply chain’s ability to cope with narrowbody engine rate increases. The 845 Leap engines delivered by CFM in 2021 was short of the company’s October 2021 forecast of 900 shipments.

Briefing analysts on 24 February, Safran chief executive Olivier Andries cited “shortages of parts, especially coming from [CFM’s] US supply chain”.

FRAGILE SITUATION

“I would like really to stress the fact that the supply chain has been extremely fragilised. The situation is extremely acute in the USA,” said Andries.

Despite challenges, CFM remains optimistic about its ability to deliver.

“Our engine production rates are fully aligned with Airbus for the A320neo family, and the Boeing 737 Max aircraft demand, through [2023]”, CFM tells FlightGlobal. The company intends to produce about 2,000 Leaps in 2023.

“We are working with our airframer customers on rates [and]… will make a decision by mid-year on future rate rises for 2024 and 2025,” CFM adds.

P&W did not respond to a request for comment.

Castings and forgings are ongoing pinch points due to complex manufacturing processes and exacting specifications.

“It’s a black art,” says Krutz. “Engine components [are] arguably the hardest part of the plane to make.”

Voids, porosity, “micro cracks” and minute product defects force such manufacturers to discard an outsized portion of their product, he says. Manufacturers of metal turbofan components sometimes must make “two to get one”.

“You can get these defects that won’t be accepted by the customers, because it might limit the life of their engine,” Krutz says. Once the metal is pressed or poured, it largely cannot be reworked. “They have to scrap it.”

Consider how that could play out as Airbus and Boeing hike production. A rate of 100 narrowbodies monthly – roughly the airframers’ combined goals – necessitates 200 engines. If a metal component supplier must discard half its product due to defects, that supplier faces the prospect of needing to make 400 copies of that component monthly.

“It’s going to be extremely challenging,” Krutz says of the chain’s ability to ramp production. “I think, eventually, the supply chain will get there.”

Such troubles are compounded by fresh factors like inflation and labour shortages, analysts say.

Many former employees, after being laid off, took jobs elsewhere. Those workers are no longer waiting around for the phone to ring – many found work at other aerospace companies, or even outside the industry.

GLOBAL TENSIONS

Broader geopolitical factors are also at play, including global tensions, which are pushing governments to increase military spending, says Richard Aboulafia, another analyst with AeroDynamic. “This is the most buoyant aerospace defence market I’ve seen.”

As a result, defence OEMs and large contractors have launched into hiring mode; they are filling positions with workers poached from smaller aerospace suppliers.

“A lot of people have been hired away by the defence firms, because defence spending is going gangbusters,” says Aboulafia.

Such large contractors often work under government contracts that permit them to pass increased costs to government customers, helping skirt inflation, the analysts note.

A new cadre of well-capitalised aerospace start-ups are also competing for labour. Those include electric air taxi developers, some of which have landed hundreds of millions of dollars in investment. Their designs may be unproven, but many such companies have enough cash to attract top aerospace engineers.

Such factors are trickling into the engine supply chain and pooling at the feet of small suppliers, which are particularly impacted, Krutz says. The smaller companies already tend to pay less than larger firms. Now, they must hike pay to keep existing employees and to attract new ones.

“Bigger companies are setting the standard for higher wages,” says Krutz. “It takes talent from the lower tiers [and] makes the lower tiers… have to pay more for the existing and new talent coming in.”

Many industries face similar problems, but Krutz says engine makers are particularly affected, because they rely to an outsized degree on components sourced from smaller companies.

These firms, which might have $10 million to $100 million in annual revenue, form the “tail” of the turbofan supply chain. They include “lots of mom and pop shops that do very specialised type of work”, such as manufacturing valves, nozzles or wire harnesses.

Compared to other manufacturers, engine makers have “a longer tail”, Krutz says. He estimates 20% of their spending goes to smaller companies, which often make the same components as other suppliers. The OEMs added small shops to their chains over years, part of a strategy to avoid disruptions when suppliers struggle.

Inflation has also been pushing up material costs, and broader supply chain disruptions have been delaying delivery of raw materials.

“Inflation is seeping in. At some suppliers… it’s 10% or more,” says Michaels.

Krutz says 12 to 15 months might pass between when an engine supplier orders materials to when those materials become a completed product.

“That’s a big, big pressure… financially for those forging businesses,” he says. “It stresses your balance sheet.”

It all adds up to an aerospace supply chain ripe with uncertainty.

“Demand from Airbus and Boeing and Embraer… [is] going up every week,” says Mark Stuckey, vice-president of global aerospace and defence at aluminium supplier Arconic. “This supply chain disruption… in addition to the build-rate ramp up, just means there are going to be all kinds of problems.”"

Date: March 31, 2022

By Zach Griff, The Points Guy

Last summer, United placed its largest single aircraft order in the history of the airline.

The Chicago-based carrier announced firm orders with Boeing for 50 737 Max 8 aircraft and 150 of the longer 737 Max 10 variant, and with Airbus for 70 of the European plane maker’s A321neo, or “new engine option.”

The order is part of the “United Next” program, which is designed to guide the company through its post-pandemic development. (The airline also unveiled a new signature interior and retrofit program as part of the grand reveal last June.)

While details of United’s new aircraft deployment strategy and configuration were initially light, we’re now learning more about the carrier’s plans.

To start, United now expects to receive delivery of its first Airbus A321neo in spring 2023, according to an internal employee communication, which was viewed by TPG and later confirmed by a carrier spokesperson. This timeline is on track with the “early 2023” estimate it provided last June.

Additionally, the carrier will deploy the new A321neo fleet “primarily on domestic routes, filling a role similar to our other large narrowbody aircraft,” the internal memo reads. Right now, United’s largest narrowbody plane by capacity is the 234-seat Boeing 757-300, and the second-largest is the Boeing 737-900 (and 737 Max 9), which has space for 179 passengers.

Taking a look at the airline’s domestic routes for these jets shows that they fly a variety of flights across the country, including the 2,704-mile route from Boston (BOS) to San Francisco (SFO), and the 147-mile hop from Houston (IAH) to Austin (AUS).

United also confirmed that its A321neos will sport the Airbus Cabin Flex fuselage, which means that there will be four cabin doors, two at each end of the plane, along with four overwing window exits. The airline will add a mid-cabin lavatory location to assist with traffic flow, and it’ll install the Airbus XL overhead bins, which should provide room for everyone’s full-size carry-on.

United will add an additional feature to the overhead bins that lowers the resting position of the lid to assist those who aren’t tall enough with closing the bins. Furthermore, those seated in first class will likely appreciate that the A321neo will have a closet near the forward galley for coat storage.

The airline also reiterated that the plane will feature its new signature interior, which includes seat-back entertainment monitors, AC and USB power outlets at all seats and the industry’s fastest available Wi-Fi (which is presumably from ViaSat).

The airline didn’t publish a seat map in the internal memo, so we’ll be sure to follow up with details once they’re public. The airline in June announced that the A321neo is expected to have a similar number of first class and extra-legroom Economy Plus seats as the new 737 Max 10, which will feature 20 and 64, respectively.

The Airbus A321neo has proven to be a popular option for airlines looking for large-gauge single-aisle aircraft. In the U.S., Alaska, American and JetBlue all operate the A321neo, while Delta recently took delivery of its first airframe, with plans to inaugurate the jet in May.

The A321neo offers more favorable economics thanks to improved fuel efficiency and other aerodynamic improvements that have made it a popular choice with U.S. operators. By 2026, United expects that this big aircraft order will lower its total carbon emissions per seat by up to 15%."
How old cooking oil helped power Airbus's biggest plane - Popular Science,"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9haXJidXMtdGVzdHMtc2FmLWluLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus may have decided to stop producing its double-decker A380 aircraft more than three years ago, but the company is now using one of those giant planes as a testbed to experiment with technology that could play a role in the future of aviation. Last Friday, an A380 test aircraft flew for some three hours with one of its four engines powered by 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel.

Airbus flew the same A380 again today, this time for about two hours, and again with one engine getting its power from 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. In these tests, the aircraft’s other three engines burned conventional jet fuel.

Airbus has flown other aircraft using 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel before—both its A350 and A319neo last year—but these recent flights mark the first time it has experimented with the A380, the biggest passenger plane there is. Steven Le Moing, Airbus’s SAF program manager, describes the SAF-powered engine’s performance as completely “normal” and was the same as what they’d seen in previous tests on the other aircraft.

The plane’s test pilot, Wolfgang Absmeier, reported the same. “We didn’t notice any difference, from a pilot point of view,” he said in a video. “The engineers in the back, they were looking at 1,000 parameters, but at first glance, there was no difference at all.”

A look at the other aircraft that Airbus has tested out sustainable aviation fuels on. Airbus

Commercial aircraft are already allowed to fly on a mix of regular jet fuel and SAF—as much as 50 percent SAF—but what makes these tests interesting is that one engine was running on 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel. In this case, the fuel in question mostly came from “used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats,” Airbus says. It’s called a HEFA fuel, which stands for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids.

[Related: All your burning questions about sustainable aviation fuel, answered]

Joshua Heyne, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Dayton, says that “there’s interest from industry to move to the fuel that Airbus tested for this flight.”

However, he says that questions remain about using this type of SAF in the 100-percent form, as opposed to a blend of it with the regular kerosene. The first concern he has is about how compatible it is with the materials in the aircraft, as it could potentially impact seals, or o-rings, in the system, and cause leaks.

The second is the potential for the fuel to affect the way the aircraft measures the quantity of the fuel in the tanks, since it could have a different density compared to traditional jet fuel. Le Moing, of Airbus, says that this second issue has been on their radar. “One of the topics that we explore is the behavior of the gauging system,” he says.

The reason that companies like Airbus are interested in sustainable aviation fuels is because they represent one way to make the industry greener, and ideally contribute less to climate change. Sustainable aviation fuels are a complex topic—here’s an explainer—but they should have less of a carbon footprint than the regular stuff when considering their whole lifecycle. Heyne says that the HEFA fuels also produce less soot and are less likely to create contrails, too.

Besides this Airbus test in the A380 and its other tests last year, other companies have tested out using sustainable aviation fuel. For example, United operated a passenger flight on a 737 MAX last year, with one of its engines burning 100-percent sustainable aviation fuel.

Airbus even has plans to use an A380 to test out hydrogen fuel, although that’s several years away.

Heyne says that the aviation industry is interested in the HEFA-type sustainable aviation fuels that Airbus tested, but he notes that supply availability could be a challenge. “Unfortunately, there’s just not a lot of used cooking oil out there—there’s not enough of it to replace all the aviation fuel we need,” Heyne says, “so we’ve got to look at other pathways.”

Delta’s 'new' Airbus A350s are going to be a big downgrade - The Points Guy,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1vdXRkYXRlZC1jYWJpbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After Delta retired its Boeing 777 fleet during the pandemic, it dubbed the Airbus A350 its flagship aircraft.

After all, the airline's Airbus A350-900s sport Delta's fanciest cabins, including an all-suite business-class along with Premium Select recliners. The biz pods each have sliding doors and direct aisle access, while the premium economy recliners offer more space than coach with upgraded service and amenities.

Delta deploys its A350s on high-profile long-haul routes, such as Atlanta (ATL) to Seoul (ICN) and to Johannesburg (JNB).

Right now, the airline has 19 A350s in its fleet, but that number is about to grow — but unfortunately that's not going to come with the onboard experience customers have come to expect on Delta's other A350s.

Last summer, Delta announced that it was purchasing several used Airbus A350-900 aircraft from LATAM, after the South American mega-carrier, which is currently in bankruptcy protection, said it would retire its A350 fleet. Delta, which announced it was buying a stake in LATAM in 2019, will take nine used A350s from the carrier.

While the additional A350s will enable Delta to grow its long-haul network (especially without the 777s), the carrier has opted to keep the legacy LATAM cabins once they begin flying for Delta, a carrier spokesperson confirmed exclusively to TPG.

Delta's existing four-cabin A350s have 32 signature Delta One Suites, 48 premium economy recliners, 36 Comfort+ extra-legroom seats and 190 standard coach seats.

But these ""new"" A350s that the carrier is picking up from LATAM will feature an outdated business-class product that's arranged in a far inferior 2-2-2 configuration.

These A350s will become the airline's only wide-body business-class cabin without direct aisle access for each passenger, a big drawback for solo travelers.

Plus, these forward-facing lie-flats have limited storage and offer minimal privacy for passengers.

Additionally, the A350s coming from LATAM won't offer a premium economy cabin, which has proven to be quite popular with travelers looking to upgrade their travel experience without splurging for a biz fare.

LATAM's A350s have the same business-class seats as its Boeing 787s, pictured here (Photo courtesy of LATAM)

The A350s joining the fleet will keep the LATAM configuration, with a total of 339 seats spread across 30 business-class pods, 63 extra-legroom coach seats and 246 standard coach ones. The one possible upside for passengers is that these planes will have nearly twice as many Comfort+ seats as compared to Delta's other A350s.

While Delta isn't changing the product on these new A350s, it will repaint the jets in Delta livery, and add its logo and other branding elements, including Delta seat covers and inflight entertainment systems, throughout the planes, a carrier spokesperson confirmed to TPG.

It wasn't immediately clear if Delta would add Wi-Fi to these jets. (They didn't offer internet access when they flew for LATAM.)

Delta told TPG that it'll ultimately retrofit these jets with Delta's signature cabins, but there's no timeline available for when that conversion process might begin.

""This summer, Delta will incorporate the first three of nine pre-owned Airbus A350 aircraft into our global network,"" the carrier said in a statement to TPG. ""The aircraft feature a temporary seating configuration pending further modification to one consistent with the A350 aircraft currently in our fleet. The integration of these aircraft into our fleet will allow for an important increase to our flying capacity to help get our customers where they want to go this summer and beyond.""

For now, the airline will keep the new A350s assigned to specific routes, which should help flyers differentiate between the experiences during the booking process.

Beginning on July 1, the Atlanta (ATL) to Santiago, Chile (SCL), route will be operated by an ex-LATAM A350, while the ATL to Dublin, Ireland (DUB), route will meet the same fate starting on Aug. 1.

As the airline takes additional deliveries of these jets, I'd expect to see them popping up on more long-haul routes, and even possibly subbed in at the last minute should operational issues require a replacement aircraft.

Hopefully, Delta will keep them dedicated to certain routes to avoid needing to downgrade its premium economy flyers, and to level-set expectations.

If you'd like to avoid these A350s, be sure to check the aircraft type and seat map when making a booking.

For now, the airline isn't differentiating between the aircraft type in the search results.

Moreover, when searching for business-class fares, tickets on these ex-LATAM jets are marketed as ""Delta One Suites"" despite being a night-and-day difference from the private pods on the other A35s.

So, you'll need to do some manual research to identify routes operated by these jets.

If you see an A350 listed on a route, and the airline isn't selling premium economy, odds are that it'll be operated by one of the ex-LATAM A350s. To double-check, take a look at the seat map and see what it shows for business class.

(Screenshot courtesy of Delta)

If it shows a 2-2-2 configuration, then the flight will be operated by one of these ""new"" planes.

Hopefully, Delta will get around to retrofitting these cabins sooner rather than later.

Until then, not every A350 in the Delta fleet should be considered a ""flagship"" aircraft — and hopefully, Delta will make that clear going forward."
Delta Air Lines Partners with Airbus on Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft - FLYING,"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLW9uLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has agreed to become the first U.S. carrier to collaborate with Airbus on research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The announcement dovetails with the Atlanta-based airline’s goals to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and Airbus’ plan to use an Airbus A380 to test a hydrogen-engine demonstrator.

Delta says it plans to work with Airbus to “accelerate the development of a hydrogen-powered aircraft and the ecosystem it requires.”

“To pull the future of sustainable aviation forward, we need to accelerate the development and commercialization of potentially disruptive technologies,” said a statement Thursday from Pam Fletcher, Delta’s chief sustainability officer. “Hydrogen fuel is an exciting concept that has the potential to redefine the status quo. These tangible steps lay the groundwork for the next generation of aviation.”

Delta’s memorandum of understanding with Airbus also includes studying requirements for a hydrogen ecosystem that the industry would need to make the transition from jet-A to hydrogen fuel.

Aircraft Concept

Airbus has said any zero-emissions aircraft that would come out of Airbus’ research wouldn’t enter service until 2035, at the earliest.

Delta’s plans include “exploring the technical and economic viability of hydrogen-fueled aircraft, identifying the pathway for introduction into Delta’s fleet and operations, as well as the aircraft’s potential performance in Delta’s fleet,” the company’s statement said. The carrier also intends to identify “challenges such as flight range limits, refueling time and airport compatibility.”

Hydrogen Ecosystem

Developing the ecosystem and surrounding infrastructure to support wide-scale use of liquid hydrogen as an aviation fuel would be a challenging hurdle. Airbus has already launched significant collaborations with Air Liquide, Vinci Airports, Groupe ADP, and Plug Power in the U.S.

To become a viable fuel source, hydrogen production, storage, and delivery would all have to be scaled up. Also, not all hydrogen production methods are fully green. Transforming the global hydrogen fuel ecosystem to be entirely “eco-friendly” would involve building new production facilities.

Net Zero by 2050

Last year, Delta pledged to reach net zero by 2050 as part of the United Nations Race to Zero Campaign.

Globally, the aviation industry produces about 2.1 percent of all “human-induced” carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group.

Industry leaders say alternative fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), will play a significant role in achieving aviation emissions targets. Burning SAF—which is made from sustainable materials such as cooking oil, plant oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste—emits significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels.

Technology has helped clean up the industry somewhat since the birth of the jet age. Jet aircraft in service today are more than 80 percent more fuel efficient per seat kilometer than the initial wave of jet aircraft produced in the 1960s."
"Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Airbus conducts flight fueled by cooking oil, fatty acids - FOX 7 Austin","Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDdhdXN0aW4uY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWNvbmR1Y3RzLTMtaG91ci1mbGlnaHQtdXNpbmctMTAwLWNvbWJvLW9mLWNvb2tpbmctb2lsLWZhdHR5LWFjaWRzLWFzLWZ1ZWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g3YXVzdGluLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1jb25kdWN0cy0zLWhvdXItZmxpZ2h0LXVzaW5nLTEwMC1jb21iby1vZi1jb29raW5nLW9pbC1mYXR0eS1hY2lkcy1hcy1mdWVsLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ newest zero-emission test aircraft, named ZEROe Demonstrator, executed a 3-hour flight using essentially cooking oil as fuel on March 25, according to an Airbus news release.

The plane had one of four engines that used 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which consists of a combination of cooking oils and fatty acids.

The flight took off from the Blagnac Airport in Toulouse, France, at 8:43 a.m. and returned safely, the company said.

The SAF used to fuel the plane was produced in Normandy, France by TotalEnergies, a company that creates sustainable sources of energy for a global market, according to the company website.

The fuel was created from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which is free of aromatics and sulfur, according to Airbus.

This is the third flight an Airbus aircraft has executed using 100% SAF over the past year, the company said. The first flight was on an Airbus A350 in March 2021; the second flight was on an A319neo single-aisle aircraft in October 2021.

""Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry’s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Key statistics outlined in the Waypoint 2050 report indicate that SAF could contribute between 53% and 71% of required carbon reductions,"" the company said.

Currently, all Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with up to 50% blend of SAF that is mixed with kerosene, but the company hopes to achieve 100% SAF by the end of this decade.

A380 takes to the skies with 100% SAF. (Airbus)

Airplane CO2 emissions

Global aviation emissions account for about 2.1% of all human-made carbon emissions, according to data collected by the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG).

In 2019, flights worldwide produced 915 tons of CO2, and aviation accounted for about 12% of all transportation emissions. Road transportation accounted for 74%.

Net-zero by 2050

In October 2021, the world’s largest association of airlines said it was aiming for the air transport industry to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, while acknowledging it will be a ""huge challenge.""

The International Air Transport Association, which has key offices in Geneva, said its general meeting in Boston had agreed on the target, a commitment that would line it up with the goal of the 2015 Paris accords to help keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The industry appears to be counting heavily on a carbon-offset plan laid out by a U.N. organization on civil aviation, but suggests governments have a role to play, too.

""With collective efforts of the entire value chain and supportive government policies, aviation will achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,"" IATA Director-General Willie Walsh said in a statement.

IATA said industry can take steps through use of sustainable fuels, new plane technologies, improved efficiencies and new power sources like electric or hydrogen power — but carbon capture and carbon-offset programs will also have a role.

Airbus partners with Airlift Global to foster Helicopter Emergency Medical Services in India - Airbus,"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy1haXJidXMtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1haXJsaWZ0LWdsb2JhbC10by1mb3N0ZXItaGVsaWNvcHRlci1lbWVyZ2VuY3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hyderabad, March 25, 2022: Airbus has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airlift Global, a company backed by United Kingdom based AUM Capital to foster helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) and associated air medical services in India.

The MoU was signed at Wings India 2022, India’s flagship civil aviation event, by Sunny Guglani, Head of Airbus Helicopters, Airbus India and South Asia and Jayeis B Sonill, Director, Airlift Global in the presence of Dr. Andrew Felmming, the British Deputy High Commissioner to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and Niall Ahern, British First Secretary of Trade. Under the partnership, Airbus and Airlift Global will collaborate to develop a pilot project integrating air ambulance and medical emergency services with the aim of fostering improved healthcare accessibility and connectivity within both urban and rural environments of the country.

Airbus and Airlift Global will identify key frameworks, roadmaps and viable investment instruments necessary to support and sustain credible, impactful emergency air medical services deployment in India. Both organisations will also conduct joint research on HEMS and air ambulance services, and will encourage standardisation of operations of these services with established healthcare and related service providers. Both organisations will also form working groups of industry experts and professionals to drive awareness about HEMS.

“HEMS is a globally established best practice. There is an urgent need for this service in India. HEMS can save lives by ferrying patients and/or accident victims within the ‘Golden Hour’, help in organ transportation and taking healthcare to the remotest parts of our country,” said Sunny Guglani, Head of Airbus Helicopters, Airbus India and South Asia.

“An HEMS ecosystem needs to be built in India in partnership with government bodies, global service providers and helicopter OEMs. Our partnership with Airlift Global is a step in the direction of developing this critical segment of healthcare in India.”

Jayeis B Sonill of Airlift Global commented, “We are pleased to be given the opportunity to assist in the development of HEMS operations in India and help serve patients in their most critical hour of need. Working alongside key partners including state government agencies, medical service providers and other stakeholders, together the sustainable establishment and equitable accessibility of this vital emergency medical air service will be paramount for modern India and better serve humanity. The UK has a long history of HEMS and we look forward to sharing our insights and expertise for the common societal good.”

About 70% of India’s population lives in rural areas with limited access to quick and quality healthcare. Helicopters can bridge this gap by not only transporting patients from rural areas to equipped hospitals but also transporting medical teams to remote locations. The Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways too has recognised the utility of helicopters in saving lives and has implemented HEMS in its plans for new expressways across the country.

Airbus helicopters have been working on various life-saving missions for more than five decades. The organisation offers a range of helicopters recognised for their suitability for HEMS operations, speed and reliability, modular cabins, excellent manoeuvrability, the ability to land anywhere and low operating costs.

“The supply chain, starting with the engine manufacturers, the people that make landing gear … the people that make bits and pieces, are not equipped today to meet the production goals,” Udvar-Hazy said in a wide-ranging conversation at the ISTAT Americas conference on Tuesday. He added that he only found out “this morning” — March 8 — that all of ALC’s 2022 Max deliveries are delayed. The delays average a month.

The lessor is scheduled to take delivery of 27 Airbus A320neo-family and 33 Boeing 737-Max family aircraft this year, according to its 2021 annual report released in February. All of the aircraft are already placed with customers.

The latest narrowbody delays raise series questions about the airframers’ plans to raise production rates. Airbus aims to deliver 720 commercial aircraft, and Boeing as many as 500 aircraft in 2022 — both represent double-digit increases over last year. And both companies have ambitious goals to ramp production to a combined 110-120 A320neo and 737 Max monthly over the next few years. Executives for neither planemaker have said the increases will be easy, but see the targets as achievable.

Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr also questions Boeing’s delivery targets. In a report Tuesday, he said the 500 aircraft target increasingly looks “like a stretch” and cited the planemaker’s weak February numbers when it delivered just 20 aircraft.

Asked whether Boeing’s relationship with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is delaying the Max, Udvar-Hazy said no and again pointed to the airframer. Boeing needs to “get their act together,” he said.

This is not to say FAA relations are not negatively affecting Boeing and its customers. ALC has no view on when the airframer will resume 787 deliveries, Udvar-Hazy said and called a summer resumption “optimistic.” The departure of FAA Administrator Steve Dickson on March 31 has left the agency a “headless ship” amid rework on the 787, certification of the 737 Max 7 and 10, and the 777X program.

“This is all because of the Max, and what Boeing did with the Max,” he said of the slow pace of the FAA.

In January, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said the regulator had identified work on fuselage door surrounds on 110 787s in its inventory that needed to be completed before deliveries can resume. The FAA has indicated that it must sign off on each individual aircraft once work is complete.

Udvar-Hazy estimated that the rework necessary for the 787s in Boeing’s inventory will take up to two years.

“Every conversation we’ve had with Boeing is ‘mañana, mañana, mañana,’ and it’s been that way for months … I hope [deliveries resume] soon,” he said.

On Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Udvar-Hazy said the Russian government may soon find itself “between a rock and a hard place” in terms of internal connectivity due to its airlines’ reliance on Airbus and Boeing jets. Nearly three-quarters of the 861 in-service aircraft in Russia were Airbus or Boeing models — specifically, 304 Airbus and 332 Boeing planes — in February, according to Cirium.

Both airframers, as well as the web of suppliers and lessors around them, are barred from delivering new aircraft or providing maintenance support for existing planes under the Western economic sanctions on Russia. This has prompted Aeroflot to suspend all international flights to protect its foreign-owned fleet from repossession, and talk of potentially cannibalizing select aircraft for their parts to support other planes in the fleet.

“They really need [the air transport] network to connect Russian cities,” said Udvar-Hazy, who added that some sectors to the country’s Far East are longer than transatlantic flights between Europe and the U.S. There is no in-production Russian commercial aircraft that operate those routes.

International lessors have broadly accepted that they are unlikely to recovery any more aircraft leased to Russian airlines.

Udvar-Hazy spoke briefly of the freighter market at ISTAT. ALC is looking at Boeing’s new 777-8 freighter but said that the company does not “see a compelling case” yet for the jet, which he said is heavier than the new Airbus A350 freighter. The lessor launched the A350F at the Dubai Airshow in November with a commitment for seven aircraft."

Airbus Just Flew an A380 Superjumbo Jet Using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel - Robb Report,"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2ZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXBvd2VyZWQtYnktc2FmLTEyMzQ2NzEzMTQv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcG93ZXJlZC1ieS1zYWYtMTIzNDY3MTMxNC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus continues to soar full-speed ahead toward a greener future.

The aviation giant announced Monday that the first A380 to be powered by 100 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) successfully completed a test flight in France.

The gigantic test aircraft, known as MSN 1, took off from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Southern France last Friday, March 25, before safely landing around three hours later. During the flight, the A380 was powered by one Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine running solely on unblended SAF.

Airbus says French energy company TotalEnergies provided around 29 tons of the sustainable bio-fuel for the flight. The SAF, which is made in Normandy, comprises a mix of waste materials, including used cooking oil and other fats. As such, it results in 90 percent less particulate matter (that white stuff you see in the sky) and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 percent.

This is the third Airbus aircraft model to hit the skies on 100 percent SAF in the past 12 months, following an A350 in March 2021 and an A319neo in October 2021. Airbus also plans to run a second flight with the same A380 on March 29 to test the use of the bio-fuel during take-off and landing.

Currently, the entire Airbus fleet is certified to fly with up to a 50 percent blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. The company’s aim is to achieve certification of 100 percent SAF by the end of this decade to help meet the industry’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The experts agree that the bio-fuel will be a big help, too. The recent Waypoint 2050 report predicts SAF could contribute between 53 percent and 71 percent of the required carbon reductions. Airlines such as Gulfstream, Boeing and United have also embraced SAF and carried out successful flights using the bio-fuel.

The A380, which made its debut back in 2007, is actually no longer in production as of last year, but it’s clear the double-decker superjumbo jet still has a role to play. In fact, this particular A380, which has a special engine installed at the back, will act as a testbed for new hydrogen technologies and reportedly help Airbus bring a zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

Greener future, indeed."

The new helicopters, which represent the department’s inaugural partnership with Airbus, will be delivered later this year.

Nashville reaches 526 square miles and includes both high-density urban locations and rural areas. Each year, the department’s aviation unit responds to more than 2,000 calls, including searches for lost children, fleeing felons, drug eradication, robberies and vehicle pursuits.

“We need a versatile, powerful and proven aircraft to help us protect and serve the Nashville community,” said Metro Nashville PD Lt. Tommy Durbin. “After a thorough review of aircraft, it became clear the H125 is the right helicopter for the mission.”

The H125 is a cost effective, multi-mission helicopter that delivers high performance, enhanced maneuverability and reduced pilot workload. As the leading airborne law enforcement helicopter for many state and local agencies, the H125 accounts for nearly half of all intermediate, single-engine helicopters delivered for that mission in North America over the last decade.

“The H125 remains one of the most popular law enforcement helicopters in the U.S., and it’s not hard to see why,” said Ron Kelley, airborne law enforcement segment manager at Airbus Helicopters, Inc. “It thrives in a variety of missions, and law enforcement agencies know it will be there for them when their citizens need it most.”

Standard features on the H125 include dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, a crash resistant fuel system, and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays. The Nashville Police Department’s fleet will be configured with the latest search, communications, and surveillance equipment to support its various airborne law enforcement public safety missions.

The H125 is built at Airbus Helicopters, Inc.’s production and completion facility in Columbus, Mississippi, by a team made up of 40% U.S. veterans.

The cancellation will also apply to its subsidiaries Aurora and Rossiya, the airline said, though Aeroflot said it would continue to fly to Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

Russia had been enjoying a rare and robust aviation recovery as the only global market where domestic air traffic last year exceeded that of 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group. But the airline industry there has been hit hard in the last two weeks, as countries around the world have imposed flight bans and sanctions on Russia because of President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. Mr. Putin and President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus are allies, and Russian forces have attacked Ukraine from Belarus.

Separately, Russia’s aviation authority, Rosaviatsiya, recommended on Saturday that Russian airlines with planes registered in foreign jurisdictions suspend all flights abroad from Sunday because of fears that they could be seized by foreign governments."

A first-time Airbus customer, Kern County selected the H125 platform following a thorough vetting process and several flight demonstrations throughout 2020 and 2021. The new helicopters will protect and serve the county’s population of roughly 900,000, which includes the city of Bakersfield.

“We operate in a challenging environment with hot summers over 100 degrees, cold winters with temperatures below freezing, and as we tested and compared the H125 with other platforms, it quickly became evident that the H125 was the best helicopter overall for all of our missions and provided the best value for the County of Kern,” said Kern County Sheriff’s Office Air Support Lieutenant Joel Swanson. “We’ve operated an Air Unit for 50 years, and we are the only law enforcement airborne support in a county the size of small states. We cannot wait for these aircraft to be delivered and be put to use to support our deputies and serve the citizens of our community.”

Kern County spans roughly 8,100 square miles with a diverse terrain that includes valleys, mountains and desert, elevations of 300 ft. to 8,000 ft. Its temperatures in summer can exceed 105 degrees, requiring a helicopter than can deftly navigate hot and high conditions. In addition, the sheriff’s department sought a platform with impressive endurance, payload capability and the most advanced safety features on the market.

FAA Certification on H160 Imminent

Topping news on the certification front, Airbus Helicopters leadership announced that the company expected to gain FAA certification on its H160 twin turbine model “in the coming months.”

The medium-utility H160’s powerplants—two Safran Arrano 1As—will be SAF compatible from the outset.

“One player cannot de-carbonize the whole sector—it will require wide-scale collaboration with trusted partners,” said Shell Americas aviation manager spokesman Steven Simpson. “The SAF-powered H160 will accelerate decarbonization our operations and showcase Shell’s commitments to using as well as producing SAF.”

The H160 carries the following specifications:

Recommended cruise speed: 138 kts

Max range with standard fuel tanks: 475 nm

Max endurance with standard fuel tanks: 4.5 hrs

Flight envelope: Minus 20C to ISA plus-37C; limited to 50C

Max flight altitude: 20,000 ft

Hover ceiling (in ground effect): 9,300 ft

Capacity: 1 or 2 pilots plus up to 12 passengers

Max takeoff weight: 13,338 pounds

Shell Looks to Utilize the H160

Last year, Shell selected the H160 to integrate into its operations in the Gulf of Mexico through partner PHI, based in Lafayette, Louisiana. The year-long test will put the H160 through its paces prior to the model gaining FAA certification.

The proving would “enable the operator and the final customer to familiarize themselves with the type’s advanced features and mitigate the normal challenges around entry into service,” according to a company release in February 2021.

In an update during a briefing at Heli-Expo, Keith Mullett, managing director of PHI remarked upon how the eight-month program would simulate precisely the conditions the H160 would need to operate in order to integrate into the PHI fleet.

“The route proving program…is really an innovation and something we’re very proud of as part of this partnership.” PHI will use the “best part of a year” to put the aircraft through its paces and examine its training programs along the way.

“I think it’s important for us to realize that this has been a partnership of trust and innovation and working together to arrive at where we are today…It’s PHI’s intention to introduce SAF as part of the introduction of the H160 aircraft in the Gulf of Mexico.”

“This is a true step forward for our industry: [the H160] is safer, it is cleaner, it is quieter than anything that’s out there right now.”

Deliveries in 2021 Rebound

Airbus joined many other OEMs in both the rotorcraft and fixed-wing space in marking increased shipments in 2021, as reported in the latest figures from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) released in February.

Among the strongest winners in the French manufacturer’s portfolio: the H125/H125M, along with the H145/H145M

H125/H125M: 84 units

H130: 15 units

H135/H135M: 15 units

H145/H145M: 44 units

H155: 1 unit

H160: 0 units

H175: 4 units

H215/H215M: 3 units

H225H225M: 14 units

The 324 shipments represent a 12 percent improvement over 2020 figures, which totaled 287 in the company’s rotorcraft division, as well as the delivery numbers reported in 2019, at 300 total. Airbus marked $2.056 billion in total rotorcraft billings for 2021.

More on Partnerships with Safran, Shell

French engine and component manufacturer Safran joined Airbus and Shell in continuing to promote the utilization of sustainable aviation fuel in its powerplants, in various turbine helicopter models across the spectrum.

Specifically, Safran expects to support the use of a 50 percent blend of SAF in its Arrano 1A engines, which received FAA certification in July 2021.

For its part, Shell proposes that it will produce 2 million tonnes of SAF by 2025, which is roughly twice the volume of today’s available supply. The burn rate [of this SAF blend] translates into 50 percent less CO2 emissions, according to Simpson, speaking at Heli-Expo. “That’s a solid step in the right direction.”"
Report: Delta installing lie-flat seats in some new Airbus A321neos - The Points Guy,"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1saWUtZmxhdC1haXJidXMtYTMyMW5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines is planning a premium sub fleet for its latest narrowbody jet that will feature lie-flat beds and a premium economy section.

A week after taking delivery of the first of 155 Airbus A321neos, a report on Monday revealed that Delta will configure 21 of the new aircraft with premium cabins.

The premium A321neos will replace a sub fleet of 18 aging Boeing 757s that were originally delivered to TWA and will fly transcontinental routes, according to Skift Airline Weekly's Edward Russell.

TPG could not independently confirm the report. In a statement to TPG, a Delta spokesperson said, ""We don't have any announcements or plans to share at this time.""

The premium-configured aircraft will feature 148 seats: 16 lie-flat seats in Delta One, 12 Delta Premium Select premium economy seats, 54 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 66 economy seats, according to the report. That's 20 fewer seats than the 757s that these aircraft will be replacing, though those 757s also have 16 lie-flat seats at the pointy end of the plane and feature a fuselage that's about 10 feet longer than an A321neo.

Most Delta A321neos will feature a domestic configuration that includes a new first-class recliner seat. Those aircraft will feature 194 seats: 20 first-class seats, 42 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 132 standard coach seats.

It's unclear what type of seat Delta will select, but the layout shared by Russell appears to show the seats with direct-aisle access in a herringbone or reverse herringbone configuration, similar to the Mint product on the A321LRs that JetBlue currently flies to London.

In the past, Delta has also used these 757s on transatlantic flights. Delta has yet to order the longer-range A321LR, which JetBlue operates to London, or the extra-long-range A321XLR, which has pending orders from United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue. Those A321neo variants would be best suited for a transatlantic mission.

United has previously said that its transcontinental 757 replacement will be the 737 MAX 10, some of which will likewise feature flat beds.

PHI & Shell discuss 8-month 'route-proving' program with H160 in U.S. - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcGhpLXNoZWxsLWRpc2N1c3MtOC1tb250aC1yb3V0ZS1wcm92aW5nLXByb2dyYW0td2l0aC1oMTYwLWluLXUtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PHI and Shell have released more details of the innovative “route proving” program they will begin with Airbus later this year to launch the H160 in the U.S.

The aircraft will begin operations with PHI once it has been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration — a long-awaited step that Airbus hopes to finally complete this summer. With certification in hand, the aircraft will start the route-proving program with PHI over the Gulf of Mexico.

“It’s a pretty comprehensive use of the aircraft, pretty much simulating everything we’re going to be doing when we move to commercial operations,” Keith Mullett, managing director of PHI Aviation, told journalists during a pre-show briefing about the program.

“We’ll also be looking at how we operate the aircraft. It’s a very, very advanced aircraft, with a lot of technology on board, and I think getting that right — getting our operating procedures correct and getting the most from the aircraft, especially the safety features — is going to be really important.”

The program will last about eight months, with data flowing between Shell (the customer), PHI, and Airbus.

“We’ve never done anything like this before that I’m aware of,” said Mullett. “We generally buy a brand new helicopter and put it into service a few weeks after it’s delivered. So thankfully, with Shell’s support and with Airbus’s support, we’re able to do something like this, [which is] really paving the way for a more successful introduction.”

PHI has an initial order for four H160s, all destined for operation in the Gulf of Mexico. The aircraft is a 12-seater in oil-and-gas configuration — occupying a “popular part of the market,” said Mullett, filling a role that is currently provided by the Sikorsky S-76 and Leonardo AW139.

“It generally works the best flying to offshore platforms that are below about 110 nautical miles from shore,” said Mullett. “So that’s how we’ll be using it in the Gulf of Mexico, and that’s how we would intend to use it elsewhere around the world.”

Both Shell and PHI see the H160 as offering a potential benefit in their drive to reduce emissions — Shell is targeting a 50 percent reduction in its own operations by 2030, while PHI is announcing its sustainability program at Heli-Expo and developing supply chains to bring sustainable aviation fuels into its operations.

“[We] see a responsibility to take a leadership role in this area, whether it’s from the general decarbonization as an energy producer, or in the adoption of new technologies to enable that, for which the H160 falls in very nicely,” said Tony Cramp, managing director of Shell Aircraft.

He added that the H160’s anticipated high utilization rate was also very appealing.

“If you look at the utilization for helicopters at the moment — compared with a fixed-wing equivalent — it’s incredibly low,” he said. “We really need to be getting to a point where we’re using those aircraft for more hours of each day, and so the maintenance cost, manpower cost that the [H]160 promises, is one of the big factors that makes it attractive.”

Cramp said Shell believed the H160 would “deliver right across the board” for the company. “It’s raising the bar in terms of safety, its operational abilities, and obviously the environmental footprint as well,” he said. “The relationship we have with Airbus — the access we’ve been given to the design to the manufacturing maturity process —gives us that level of confidence.”"

Both Airbus and Boeing have withdrawn support from Russia’s aviation industry following the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Boeing confirmed on Tuesday that it was suspending all parts, maintenance and technical support for planes in Russia, while Airbus followed suit on Wednesday.

The French planemaker said it would halt support for airlines such as Aeroflot, which uses a number of Airbus jets, such as the A320, the A330, and the A350.

“In line with international sanctions now in place, Airbus has suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country,” the company said in a statement.

“Services provided by the Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia (ECAR) have also been suspended pending further review.”

It follows the decision taken by the UK, EU, US and Canada to ban all Russian owned and operated aircraft from their airspace.

Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has been forced to cancel all flights to and from these nations as a result, as well as having to reroute flight paths to avoid their airspace.

Russia has retaliated in kind, with the abovementioned nations banned from its airspace.

Before the outbreak of war, Russian outbound flight bookings for March, April and May had recovered to 32 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, according to data from travel trends analyst ForwardKeys.

But the attack on Ukraine prompted an instant collapse in the market for Russian outbound travel. Destinations that suffered the highest immediate cancellation rates in the period 24-26 February were Cyprus (300 per cent), Egypt (234 per cent), Turkey (153 per cent), the UK (153 per cent), Armenia (200 per cent) and the Maldives (165 per cent).

Oligarchs have also been hit by the sanctions, with private jet traffic out of Russia dropping by 25 per cent in the last week.

Airspace bans are significantly limiting travel options for owners: “We’ve already seen a big drop in traffic in just three days,” Richard Koe of WingX, which tracks business flights, told Robb Report."

Avianca orders another 88 Airbus A320neos | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxlZXRzL2F2aWFuY2Etb3JkZXJzLWFub3RoZXItODgtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW9zLzE0Nzg0MS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Colombia’s Avianca has ordered 88 Airbus A320neos, with deliveries scheduled between 2025 and 2031.

The Bogota-based carrier has also taken options to acquire another 50 of the jets, Avianca says on 8 March.

“This order highlights that we continue to make the required investments to grow our network in line with our business plan,” says Rohit Philip, Avianca chief financial officer.

The new aircraft will have an updated cabin configuration that will include “Premium”, “Plus” and economy seats, the airline says.

Avianca currently has 110 aircraft in its fleet, with “more than 90” A320s being reconfigured with the new seats, which the company introduced last October. The carrier says that by the end of 2022 all its aircraft will have the new interiors.

In addition to the Airbus narrowbodies, the carrier also operates A330s, Boeing 787-8s and ATR 72-600s. It serves 120 routes to 65 destinations across North and Latin America, and Europe, with 3,200 flights every week.

“The A320neo incorporates the latest technologies including new-generation engines, sharklets and aerodynamics, which together deliver 20% in fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous-generation Airbus aircraft,” says Airbus Latin America chief Arturo Barreira.

The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year after restructuring in the wake of the coronavirus crisis that brought the global aviation industry to a near-standstill in 2020.

It was the first of three major Latin American carriers to complete court-overseen financial restructuring. On 1 December, Avianca said it successfully reached agreements with its creditors, pulled in $1.7 billion in fresh capital and obtained approval for its reorganisation plan. It has pivoted to build a point-to-point network that will appeal to cost-sensitive travellers looking for direct flights and convenience.

The carrier has said it expects to “nearly double its network” in the next three years, expanding to 200 routes. It plans to operate more than 130 aircraft by the end of 2025, and is investing more than $200 million redesigning its cabins."
VSR700 autonomous take-off and landing capabilities tested at sea - Airbus,"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMy12c3I3MDAtYXV0b25vbW91cy10YWtlLW9mZi1hbmQtbGFuZGluZy1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtdGVzdGVkLWF0LXNlYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, Airbus Helicopters has begun trialing autonomous take-off and landing capabilities at sea for the VSR700, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) being developed in the frame of the SDAM (Système de drone aérien de la Marine) programme, conducted by the DGA (Direction générale de l’Armement - the French Armament General Directorate) for the French Navy. Trials were conducted using an optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) based on a modified Guimbal Cabri G2 equipped with the autonomous take-off and landing (ATOL) system developed for the VSR700. This flight test campaign paves the way for the upcoming demonstration of the VSR700, at sea, onboard a French Navy frigate.



“These tests in real-life conditions constitute a crucial step towards the campaign that we will conduct at sea with the DGA and the French Navy later this year,” explained Nicolas Delmas, head of the VSR700 programme for Airbus Helicopters. “Using the OPV, we have demonstrated the unique autonomous take-off and landing capabilities of the VSR700. We have also proved the optimal functioning of the vehicle and its command station interface on board a vessel in realistic conditions.”



The test campaign was conducted off the coast of Brest, France, onboard a civilian vessel equipped with a helicopter landing deck in the presence of experts from the DGA. Beyond demonstrating the ATOL system developed for the VSR700, the trials were also used to assess the approach procedures before landing on the vessel. The VSR700 flight envelope at sea, in proximity to a vessel, was tested in line with development objectives and was confirmed to be fully compatible with naval operations. Both the semi-autonomous and the fully autonomous modes of the ATOL system were demonstrated with success in different sea states. The VSR700 uses Airbus DeckFinder to enable autonomous ship deck take off and landings in all weather conditions, during the day or night. In total, 150 autonomous launches and recoveries took place. The handling and maneuvering of the OPV, representative of the VSR700, on the ship deck were also tested.



The OPV can carry one test pilot in order to enable safer and more agile initial testing before those systems are integrated into the fully autonomous VSR700. The OPV initially conducted piloted take-offs and landings before switching progressively to fully autonomous maneuvers.



Designed to operate alongside other shipborne naval assets, the VSR700 is a UAS in the 500-1,000 kg maximum take off weight range. It offers the best balance of payload capability, endurance and operational cost. It is capable of carrying multiple full-size naval sensors for extended periods and can operate from existing ships, alongside a helicopter, with a low logistical footprint.



The first prototype of the VSR700 performed its maiden flight in 2020 and expanded its flight envelope in 2021. In April 2021, the DGA ordered a second prototype of the VSR700 to focus on trials covering SDAM requirements and to permit broader, more rapid development towards that goal.

It's true.

Airbus says its A380 jet actually completed two test flights recently in France.

It was powered by sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which is predominantly made of used cooking oil and waste fats.

SAF is touted as being carbon neutral, because of the co2 absorbed while its organic ingredients are being grown.

The fuel is already being used in limited amounts by some airlines.

But Airbus plans to bring the world's first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

The aviation industry is coming under increasing scrutiny as a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for 2-3% of global emissions, with that figure potentially rising dramatically over the coming decades if no action is taken. Earlier this month, investor engagement network Climate Action 100+ outlined a series of expectations for airlines to follow in order to align with the IEA’s 2050 net zero scenario, including commitments to ramp the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and to limit the growth in air travel overall.

Julie Kitcher, Airbus E.V.P. Communications & Corporate Affairs, said:

“To decarbonize aviation, we need to develop the right technology bricks and a dynamic hydrogen eco-system. Through close collaboration with key partners, such as Delta, we will integrate our customers’ expertise and specific needs to ensure our zero-emission aircraft will be a game-changer for sustainable aerospace.”

Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions – such as aviation – in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. Despite being the most abundant element in the universe, however, there are no pure hydrogen deposits on Earth and it must be extracted from other materials. Significant investments are required to develop hydrogen ecosystems and clean extraction processes, such as green hydrogen, which uses a renewable energy-powered electrolysis process to extract hydrogen from water.

Focus areas under the new collaboration agreement between Delta and Airbus will include exploring the viability of hydrogen-fueled aircraft, including identifying challenges such as flight range limits, refueling time and airport compatibility, assessing the infrastructure that will be needed to develop and scale green hydrogen, and coalition building with key industry stakeholders.

Introduction

March. 31, 2021, © Leeham News: Last week’s article showed that a Boeing 787 freighter based on the -9 variant would be a suitable replacement for the aging 767-300F.

Should Boeing proceed with the aircraft, expect Airbus to launch a competing airplane, it not launch it before the American OEM.

The A330-200F recorded 38 sales as a factory freighter, a disappointing tally. Which aircraft variant could Airbus use as a baseline to develop a more successful 787F competitor?

The aircraft, registered as A6-CJE, spent two years in storage and has recently been reactivated by the flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates. According to a source inside the company, the test was successful, with the jet reaching its maximum speed at the cruise altitude, as planned.

However, upon the completion of the test, the aircraft entered a shallow dive and started picking up speed, before breaking the sound barrier at approximately 10,000 meters (33,000 feet).

According to the source, the maximum speed the aircraft achieved was 650 knots (1,200 kilometers per hour), which is almost 70 knots (150 kilometers per hour) faster than the speed of sound at that altitude.

“We thought it is done for, we really did. But when it landed, we performed all the checks, and it turned out the plane was completely fine,” an employee of the company, who wishes to remain anonymous, told AeroTime.

Not only did the aircraft break the sound barrier, but it also maintained stable supersonic speed for over two minutes, before the engines started overheating. According to the source, only certain components sustained minor damage. For example, a drainage tube, which is used to discharge waste from the lavatory system, was clogged.

“Theoretically possible”

There have been previous instances of subsonic commercial airplanes breaking the sound barrier in a dive. The most prominent example occurred in 1961, when Douglas DC-8 maintained the speed of Mach 1.012 for 16 seconds in a dive. However, the DC-8 had much weaker engines than the A380, and thus could not sustain such speeds for longer periods of time, or in level flight.

AeroTime contacted Solomon Epstein, the deputy chief engineer at Airbus S.A.S Propulsion Systems Attachment department. Between 1995 and 2001 Epstein oversaw the selection and fitting of Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofan engines during the design phase of the Airbus A380.

“Theoretically it is possible. It would be extremely dangerous, but possible. I am not at all surprised they managed to pull it off,” Epstein commented when presented with the results of the testing.

The maximum theoretical thrust of the Trent 900 is almost 380 kN (kilonewtons), Epstein explained. During a routine take-off, the engine usually produces no more than 330 kN, while during cruise flight at high altitude, no more than 90 kN is needed.

“We have tried pushing the engines up to 200 kN in cruise flight, that’s how the maximum speed of 1,020 km/h, which you can see on Wikipedia, was reached. We did not push it further, there was no need. I guess it could go faster. You have to talk to airframe guys to find out if it can go faster,” Epstein said.

AeroTime has contacted Lawrence Marvick, who was the chief structural engineer at Airbus S.A.S. at the time when the A380 was being designed. However, Marvick declined to comment, saying that he never heard anything about secret supersonic tests of the A380 prototype performed for the United Kingdom Royal Air Force (RAF) in the 1990s.

Possible commercial use

AeroTime contacted Emirates to confirm the story. According to a spokesperson, the accidental supersonic flight during the test really happened, but the results were inconclusive in terms of getting the A380 to go supersonic during commercial operations.

“The A380 is the most prestigious aircraft in the world. Supersonic operations would be a coup for us. The test on April 1 was very promising, but we want to be cautious. A lot more testing has to be done before we know how viable it really is,” the Emirates spokesperson replied to an inquiry by AeroTime.

If implemented, even the limited ability to perform supersonic flight would vastly expand the operational envelope of the A380. At 1,200 km/h it would reach current destinations almost 50% faster, while further improvements, such as more powerful engines, are possible as well.

The General Electric GE9X, which is currently the most powerful engine in the world, has the maximum thrust of 490 kN – almost twice more than the Trent 900.

AeroTime has contacted Zapod Biblerox, an engineer at General Electric, who confirmed that the company has been discussing the sale of unspecified amount of GE9X engines to Emirates. However, the discussions have not reached an advanced stage yet.

“We had a feeling they might want to fit them on their A380s. What a beast that would be. Double the power, double the speed. Put the right pilot in, strip it down a bit, and the thing could go hypersonic,” Bibleros explained.

Hypersonic aircraft can fly five or more times faster than the speed of sound. Currently, leading aerospace manufacturers from such countries as Australia, Canada and Latvia are experimenting with hypersonic aircraft powered by environmentally friendly fuels such as hydrogen, methane and starch.

Not the first time

According to another General Electric engineer, who works under Bibleros and expressed a desire to remain anonymous, there have been earlier reports of Airbus A380 prototypes reaching high supersonic speeds.

Reportedly, the tests were performed between 1975 and 1998 under the special supervision of the United Kingdom Secret Intelligence Service (commonly known as MI6) at the Royal Air Force (RAF) base Luton (LTN), and involved a prototype of the Airbus A380, then known as the A3XX.

The aircraft, fitted with four experimental Atomus engines, was observed reaching the speed of Mach 3 before losing control over Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. The event caused the name of the engine to be associated with infinitesimally small particles, in reference to the pieces to which the aircraft disintegrated. That name eventually entered the English lexicon as the word Atom, which later became a scientific term for the constituent parts of matter.

“That’s Atomus for ya. 60’s technology. What, 300 kN? 400? Now imagine GE9X with almost 500 kN. Imagine an even more powerful engine. Like, improbably powerful. The jet would go like woooosh, like, really fast. Just imagine,” the GE source told Aerotime, and started making strange gestures with the broom he was holding in his hands.

According to another unconfirmed source, a US-based startup Pan American World Airways is currently discussing the possibility of purchasing several of Emirates’ A380s, renaming them Orion III in reference to the Blackburn B-25 Orion, a successful WWII fighter jet, and commencing a bi-weekly service to the Moon."
