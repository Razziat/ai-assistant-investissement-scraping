Mobile Brookley Aeroplex positioned to be anchor in growing aerospace corridor | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Mon, 08 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTMvMDQvbW9iaWxlLWJyb29rbGV5LWFlcm9wbGV4LWdldHMtdXBncmFkZXMtYXMtYWlyYnVzLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ final assembly line at the Brookley complex will produce the A320 family of narrow-body jetliners, with the first customer delivery taking place in Mobile in 2016. But the ripple effects of the project will be felt long before then, and Brookley stands to be the prime beneficiary.

“Brookley is situated right in the center of the Gulf Coast aerospace corridor, and the Airbus facility sets us up to be the nucleus of that corridor,” said Bill Sisson, the former executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority, which owns and operates the Brookley complex.

Airbus officially begins construction of the facility at the Brookley site today with a groundbreaking ceremony.

Sisson, now president of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, said Brookley is ideally equipped to capitalize on growth fueled by Airbus and the region’s rising aerospace/aviation sector. The 1,650-acre industrial park has a runway capable of landing the world’s largest aircraft, stands adjacent to one of the nation’s busiest ports and connects to two interstates and five railroads.

In addition, Brookley’s prospects for growth in aviation/aerospace are enhanced by Alabama’s top-rated worker training programs and the state’s proven track record in economic development, Sisson said. Also, the aviation/aerospace sector is a key target in Accelerate Alabama, the state’s five-year strategic economic development growth plan.

“Because Airbus is locating here, it really positions Brookley as a great anchor for development,” Sissons said. “All of the logistics that drew Airbus here in the first place also apply to suppliers as well. It’s certainly hard to beat Brookley’s logistics.”

Alabama already has a vibrant aerospace sector, comprised of more than 300 companies with 83,000 employees, according to the Alabama Department of Commerce. Many of the biggest aerospace companies have a presence in the state, and the industry spans from Huntsville to the Gulf Coast.

Huntsville has been a major hub for decades with Redstone Arsenal, the center of the U.S. Army’s missile and rocket programs, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, where the Saturn V rocket that took man to the moon was developed.

Montgomery was the site of the nation’s first civilian flight school, founded by Orville and Wilbur Wright. Today, its Maxwell Air Force Base employs 12,000 people and servcs as the headquarters of the Air University, a major training institution.

In Mobile, Brookley houses aviation and aerospace companies including ST Aerospace, which provides commercial aircraft maintenance, and Continental Motors, which makes piston engines for light planes. Airbus also has an engineering office at Brookley. Together, these companies employ more than 2,000 people.

“We already have the beginnings of an aerospace cluster here,” Sisson said.

Sisson said Brookley is logical first-choice location for key Airbus suppliers that need to be in close proximity to the A320 assembly line. Safran Engineering, a service provider to Airbus, is holding a grand-opening ceremony today for its office at Brookley.

Sisson expects other to follow.

“There are a certain number of suppliers that will need to be on the Airbus campus because of production needs,” he said.

The Gulf Coast Aerospace Corridor is often defined as the stretch along Interstate 10 from New Orleans to Panama City, Fla., that hosts a heavy concentration of military bases involved in aviation and a significant NASA presence."
Airbus Offers Extra Wide Seats For Fat Passengers - Business Insider,"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9mZmVycy1leHRyYS13aWRlLXNlYXRzLWZvci1mYXQtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy0yMDEzLTTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1vZmZlcnMtZXh0cmEtd2lkZS1zZWF0cy1mb3ItZmF0LXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtMjAxMy00P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will offer airlines the option of extra-wide seats on its A320 jets to keep up with ""trends in demographics"" and accommodate large passengers, it announced this week at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg.

The extra-wide seats will measure 20 inches across instead of the standard 18 inches, and will likely be installed only as aisle seats.

The window and middle seats will each lose an inch of width to generate the extra space.

Airbus sells the idea as an innovative way to ""meet passenger needs,"" even though two-thirds of its customers will lose out.

The planemaker first floated the idea in 2012, and not everyone loved it: A July poll by Skyscanner found 80 percent of Brits opposed losing an inch of seating to accommodate their larger neighbors, according to AOL UK.

The real winners will be airlines, who will be able to charge extra for the extra-wide seats.

""Passengers in the window seat are already happy and those in the centre seat might not be willing to pay as much for the extra width,"" Airbus aircraft interiors marketing manager Stefanie Von Linstow told Flightglobal.

""The aisle seat seems the most attractive for the concept.""

The issue of how to accommodate large passengers while maintaining already thin profit margins is a difficult one for airlines, which need to minimize the weight of their aircraft to save money on fuel.

The idea of a ""fat tax"" — charging heavy customers an extra fee — is untenable in the U.S. for the time being. Charging extra money for a slightly wider seat is a small step in that direction."
Airbus continues corporate jet battle with Boeing - Corporate Jet Investor,"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnBvcmF0ZWpldGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1jb250aW51ZXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWpldC1iYXR0bGUtd2l0aC1ib2VpbmctMzE2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus continues corporate jet battle with Boeing

news by CJI Expert April 30, 2013 Print this page

Airbus looks to the future with its ultra-long range and ultra-modern family of corporate jets after being out-delivered by Boeing – only for the second time – in 2012.

For the last two years, Airbus’ share of the business jet market has stood at just one percent, but when you are selling jets for around $50 million, you could argue that this is hardly the point.

Like Boeing Business Jets, Airbus builds only long-range, supersized corporate airliners – lavishly decorated and capable of carrying well in excess of 20 passengers in extreme comfort.



Airbus versus Boeing

While Boeing boasts that their BBJs are purpose-built business aircraft, Airbus, headquartered in Toulouse, France, says its family of Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJs) is the most modern family of corporate jets on the market.

“If you look at Boeing, they are still producing the aircraft they were building decades ago,” says David Velupillai, marketing and communications director for Airbus Corporate Jets. “They have tried to make improvements, but, under the skin, they are the same aircraft from the 1960s.”

This was not exactly something that Captain Stephen Taylor, president of Boeing Business Jets, sidestepped in a recent interview with Corporate Jet Investor (“If I am honest, the 737 that we sell today is pretty much the same aircraft that we were selling 16 years ago”) and is precisely why Boeing – who Velupillai consistently refers to as “brand B” throughout our interview – launched the BBJ Max at the end of 2012, which is said to offer an extra 14 per cent of range and a 13 per cent cut down in fuel consumption.

“Boeing may have been talking a lot about the BBJ Max, but the reality is that it will not be ready until something like 2017, which is a very long time away for customers in this market,” says Velupillai.



Deliveries down in 2012

Business jet deliveries were down across the board in 2012 and Airbus was no exception, delivering nine corporate jets, the company’s lowest since 2005. Although Boeing delivered 12 jets last year, this was the only the second time since 2005 that Airbus had been out-delivered by its competitor.

After Airbus builds a jet, the ‘green aircraft’ is then delivered to a cabin outfitter, where the customised interior is fitted and the exterior is painted. Airbus recommends using one of the eight centres which have been audited by the company, and although the customer may end up choosing a centre which is not affiliated with Airbus, Velupillai is keen to stress that the manufacturer still plays an active role in the completions process.

“We will sit down with the customer and will try to understand their needs and how many people they want to fly,” he says. “We will help them to produce a specification for the cabin, which the customer can then take to the outfitter.”

Vellupillai calculates that based on current lead times, Airbus could deliver an aircraft ordered at the time of speaking [April 2013] by the end of 2014. However, the customer must then wait a further 12-18 months before they can fly in the completed aircraft.



Camels, horses and Rolls Royce’s

The primary customers of Airbus Corporate Jets are billionaire private individuals, although the manufacturer also sells executive jets to governments – including Italy, Germany, Thailand, Brazil, France and Venezuela, amongst others – as well as companies that use the aircraft for VVIP charter, like Comlux, Twinjet and Vertis.

Airbus made headlines in the last few years with the sale of the first privately-owned double-decker A380 – the world’s biggest passenger airliner – to Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, who reportedly paid over $500 million for the completed aircraft.

Although there were stories that the jet would include features an extravagant as a garage to hold two Rolls Royce’s and a stable for the Prince’s horses and camels, Vellupillai denies that this was ever the case.

“The private customer is really looking to take the space and lifestyle that they are used to on the ground into the air,” says Vellupillai. “They need a comfortable environment to relax and entertain and so on. The vast majority are not concerned with anything too exotic.”



The size of a house

Regardless of the degree of luxury chosen by the customer, even the smallest member of the Airbus Corporate Jet family, the ACJ18, still offers 80 square metres of floor space in the cabin, which as Vellupillai notes, is “pretty much the size of a house or an apartment.”

The sheer size of an ACJ and its ability to carry large numbers of passengers in varying standards of comfort has proved particularly popular amongst governments.

“One section of the aircraft can be used as an office by day and bedroom by night,” says Vellupillai. “Then you can have economy in the back and a separate business class section.”

“Governments can carry advisers, support staff, heads of companies, maybe even some media, and they do not have to go out and charter extra capacity,” he adds.

Although ACJs can carry more than 100 passengers when configured as airliners, Vellupillai says that most private customers opt for a 19 seat-configuration, making it possible to carry large families while avoiding some of the more stringent restrictions that come with chartering the aircraft for extra revenue.



Big in China

Predictably, Airbus sees China as a big priority at the moment, with Vellupillai noting the fact that the country remains the world’s highest GDP group as well as a relatively new market for business jets. The company proved its commitment to the region by displaying an ACJ318 corporate jet – operated by Comlux – at this year’s annual ABACE event in Shanghai.

A recent study published by the Asian Sky Group claimed that Airbus dominates the corporate airliner segment in Greater China with a 58 per cent market share.

Their study showed that there were a total of 18 ACJs in Greater China at the end of 2012 – six ACJ318s, 10 ACJ319s, one ACJ319 VIP and one ACJ330.

Despite Airbus’ strong presence in China, Vellupillai says that the Middle-East is traditionally the manufacturer’s best-performing region for aircraft.

“Russia was quiet for a while, but we have seen more activity there lately,” he adds."

Given the massive backlog in orders for the new narrow body plane, this is where Airbus needs the capacity.

However, the Airbus Alabama plant is about more than the A320. It's also about giving the European plane maker a better shot at landing U.S. commercial and military orders in the years to come.

Airbus has no plans to build military planes in Mobile, but don't be surprised if that changes in the years to come. Washington has long given Boeing the leg up on major military aircraft contracts in part because the planes are built here in the U.S. by American workers. Airbus will now be able to make that same offer when bidding on Pentagon contracts.

""It will enhance our image because we are procuring $13 billion from U.S. suppliers, we have more than 1,000 employees so far but we are not seen as a U.S. manufacturer,"" said Bregier. ""We will be seen as a very good U.S. citizen which is always helpful when deals with military contracts.""

Airbus Pulls Ahead on Orders

The Mobile ground breaking comes just weeks after Airbus wrapped up a first quarter where it outpaced Boeing in orders and deliveries. Some of that was due to Boeing being unable to deliver any Dreamliners from mid-January through March.



Still, Airbus has been able to raise the pressure on Boeing in areas where Boeing has long been dominant.

Last month it landed an order for more than $20 billion with Lion Air out of Indonesia. Lion Air has long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers.

That order helped Airbus beat Boeing in the first quarter. It was a welcome rebound after Boeing edged Airbus in orders and deliveries last year.

British Air and the A350

Meanwhile, Airbus is close to landing another highly coveted order with another long-time Boeing customer.



British Air is negotiating with Airbus to buy more than $7 billion worth of A350 wide body planes. The new A350s would replace aging Boeing 777 models.

(Read More: Boeing 787 Could Face Costly New Challenge)



Boeing is working on a next-generation of the 777, called the 777X. However, a final design has yet to be approved and while it works on a new 777 many believe it leaves the door open for British Air to order A350s.

The wide-body commercial plane market is far more lucrative than the single aisle segment. The planes have book prices that are more than double the price on narrow body aircraft. It's also a segment Boeing has dominated for years with the 747, 777, and now the 787 Dreamliner.

Biggest Order Ever for Airbus placed by Indonesian Airline - Borgen Project,"Mon, 01 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmdlbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iaWdnZXN0LW9yZGVyLWV2ZXItZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFjZWQtYnktaW5kb25lc2lhbi1haXJsaW5lLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indonesia’s drop in poverty has created millions of new consumers… Including airline passengers.

The struggling French economy has just received a boost in the form of the biggest order ever for Airbus. Indonesia’s Lion Air has just placed an order for 169 A320s and 65 A321 jets worth 18.4 billion Euros with the French aircraft manufacturer.

Lion Air is a major player in Indonesia, holding about 45% market share there. Indonesia has experienced tremendous economic growth and a boom in air travel. Deregulation of the aviation sector in the 1990s has made air travel affordable for many of Indonesia’s 240 million inhabitants, leading to the appearance of dozens of airlines. Although Lion Air currently operates mostly domestic flights, it is likely to begin flying to destinations in other Asian countries.

This is not the first huge order for planes placed by Lion Air, although it is the first time that the company has ordered from Airbus. In 2011, it ordered 230 planes from Boeing, representing that company’s biggest order ever as well. This order was one of the factors that contributed to Boeing passing Airbus to become the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer.

The two companies are locked in a duopoly in the manufacture of large aircraft and are highly competitive with each other. The Airbus order from Lion Air could perhaps shift the momentum for the company to take the lead from Boeing again. Lion Air is a low cost carrier, and it is likely that other emerging low cost carriers will follow its example and order medium-haul jets from Airbus.

The potential for air travel in Indonesia is tremendous. Right now, only 6% of Indonesia’s population has traveled by airplane. It is estimated that 180 million people will fly domestically in Indonesia by 2021, which is three times as many as in 2011. Within the next 10 years, 900 new planes are expected to be delivered to Indonesia.

The potential in Indonesia is representative of the opportunities for aircraft manufacturers in Asia more generally. For example, although there 10 times as many people in Asia as in the United States, right now, there are about three times as many planes in the US.

The rapidly growing Asian economies have led to an emerging middle class. This will certainly increase the demand for air travel, as well as many other previously unattainable products and services, in this part of the world, and no one single aircraft manufacturer or other type of company will be able to meet the demand. This is very good news for both Airbus and Boeing as well as for many other companies looking to target Asia’s rapidly expanding middle classes.

In the case of Airbus in particular, the increased presence in Indonesia will have immediate benefits for the company and France as well as potential longer-term consequences for other European and French companies. Unemployment in France stands at 10% and layoffs from companies are common, so the economy will receive a boost from manufacturing the 234 planes, which will be conducted in France and involve 5,000 employees there. The order could also be influential in helping the rest of Europe. Airbus is owned by EADS, an aerospace and defense company whose shareholders include the Spanish, French and German governments.

French Prime Minister François Hollande hopes that the deal and successful cooperation of several countries in EADS will inspire similar cross-country cooperation in other industries, thereby strengthening European industrial output. There is certainly a huge opportunity to feed booming economies in the developing world, and European companies may need to work together in order to make the most of it.

Putting the U.S. into AirbUS – Building a Factory in Mobile Alabama - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNC9wdXR0aW5nLXRoZS11LXMtaW50by1haXJidXMtYnVpbGRpbmctYS1mYWN0b3J5LWluLW1vYmlsZS1hbGFiYW1hL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last Monday Airbus took its first step towards being an around the clock aircraft maker as it broke ground on its new Mobile, Alabama A320 plant.

When we say around the clock we literally mean it, with the new Mobile factory this will be the 4thA320 factory in the world with others in China, Germany and the company’s headquarters in Toulouse France. When the A320’s begin to be built in this factory the sun will never set on the baby bus.

At the ceremony, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brgier acknowledged how important and significant it is for the company to open a facility in the US, ’œBuilding an A320 family assembly line in Mobile is truly groundbreaking for Airbus. Our customers need more aircraft that cut fuel burn, emissions and operating costs. With this assembly line we will be able to meet our customers’ need at their doorstep, in addition to the worldwide demand for these efficient aircraft. When the line opens, we will be the only maker to assemble aircraft in Asia, Americas and Europe.’

The new line will be located at the Mobile Brookley Aeroplex and will be able to assemble the entire A320 family: the A319, A320 and A321. The airline to receive the first US built A320 will be JetBlue. “We’re excited to welcome our long-term partners at Airbus to the United States and we look forward to taking delivery of the first U.S.-produced Airbus in 2016,” JetBlue spokesperson Mateo LLeras explained to AirlineReporter.com.

Major construction is set to begin this summer and be complete by late 2015 with the first aircraft set to be delivered in early 2016. Once they get the dust settled and Airbus hopes that the assembly line will produce four aircraft per month. The manufacture plans to deliver aircraft from Mobile to North and South America airline customers.

So why is Airbus making this move? Well you have to go back to 2005 when Boeing was originally awarded the US Air Force (AF) Tanker contract. There were too many question surrounding fraud, that the Air Force was required to re-bid. Airbus wanted in on the contract and to make their bid serious, the aircraft maker purchased land in Mobile that it intended to open an A330 tanker factory if they won. In 2008 Airbus was awarded the contract to build the A330 Multi Role Tanker (MRT), so they went through with the purchase the land.

After an appeal by Boeing, the Air Force decided to re-bid for a third time where Boeing won with their 767MRT. But now Airbus had all of this land and once they learned that they lost the contract Airbus announced that it still intended to bring a couple thousand jobs to the Mobile area and create an A320 plant instead of trying to sell the land.

One question that we are all curious about at AirlineReporter.com is that by having this factory in the US now can Airbus sway major US Boeing customers to come its way such as Southwest Airlines, United Airlines or Delta Air Lines who have do already (with an exception to Southwest) have Airbuses in its fleet but only cause they acquired them through mergers with other US major airlines, not from its own purchases.

Also there is potential for Airbus to acquire more land in Mobile, could we see a second line down the road or another type come to the US all together? This could get interesting.

Which of these would be more effective at conducting a humanitarian relief in a threat area?

CRISIS 2016 – A simmering conflict in a Central African nation has spread to a neighbouring country, with armed militias crossing the border and threatening the stability of a newly-elected government. With little notice, its Capital City comes under threat, and a plea is made to the international community for peacekeepers to help restore order.

With historic ties to the region, France is quick off the mark, dispatching an A400M Atlas with a HQ contingent, pallets of equipment, and peacekeepers – 60 personnel in all, with 20 tonnes of cargo. Meanwhile, another Western European nation pledges its assistance, but must turn to the private sector for its airlift needs – they charter a Shorts Belfast to carry their contingent, which will consist of a similar force of 100 peacekeepers along with engineering equipment.

Both transports leave Europe within an hour of each other, however the faster Atlas is first to arrive in Capital City. Rolling blackouts mean the Atlas’ crew need to use Night-Vision Goggles to touch down on a pitch black runway. The slower Belfast meanwhile arrives by dawn, its crew making a VFR approach. By then, the Atlas has reversed itself onto a gravel apron to disgorge its load, and begun loading foreign citizens for evacuation. The Belfast meanwhile is unloaded on a taxiway – all available concrete aprons at Capital City’s airport are occupied by the hulks of 727s and Tu-134s abandoned by the previous regime. Fortunately, the Belfast has brought with it a bulldozer and tow, and by mid-morning, enough cleared space has been made on the concrete tarmac. By now, the Atlas has departed with a full complement of 116 evacuees.

At midday, a panicked message comes through to the peacekeepers – a contingent of 130 people (including an Al Jazeera correspondent and their cameraman) are stranded in a village on the country’s border, with militias cutting off all roads in and out. The Belfast has been unloaded and is ready, but there’s a problem – the village’s airstrip is unsurfaced, and too short for it to land there. Another French Atlas is heading for Capital City carrying a load of peacekeepers, and is re-directed inflight, touching down at the village airstrip after dark – again, with the crew utilising Night-Vision Goggles.

(Avro Vulcan Vs Northrop Grumman B-2 here

It’ll take two trips to shuttle out the village evacuees by Atlas to the Capital City. The first flight is made without problem, but during the loading of passengers for the second flight, intelligence is received that the militias have enlisted a ‘sympathetic’ Air Force Colonel from their home country to the cause. MiG-23s have been observed sneaking over the border, and while French AWACS and Fighter Cover are on their way, the Atlas crew need to leave the airstrip – and fast. Wearing Night-Vision Goggles, the crew of the Atlas lifts off the runway but stays low, using terrain to mask the aircraft from detection.

The trip to Capital City is made without incident, and the evacuees cross the tarmac to the waiting Belfast. There’s just enough time for the Belfast’s crew to stroll over to the newer airlifter and give it a look over. They listen to the Atlas’ crew describe in (broad) detail the evacuation mission, and tour over the 21st century airlifter. The Belfast’s crew have their tour cut short however when their own aircraft, some 52 years old, has been loaded and is ready to fly out.

Winner: A400M Atlas. It’s an unfair comparison – the Belfast was never intended to take payloads ‘to the foxhole’ – but rather, deliver loads to a bridgehead where they could either self-deploy or be loaded in to Beverleys or Argosies. On a strategic level, it’s a fairly even fight – the Belfast is roomier, the Atlas a lot faster. Both are easy to load. But the Atlas is built to land with its load to the fight, under whatever conditions. Despite broadly similar planform and dimensions, it’s hard to compare two aircraft seperated by 40 years and two different roles. What is interesting however is that they are two aircraft united by a common ‘enemy’ – the C-130.

It’s been suggested that had fate turned differently for the United Kingdom, 30 Belfasts would have been produced (instead of 10), and they would have served a full career (instead of retirement from the service in the mid-70s). A few soldiered on in to civil charter, but the Belfast’s race was over before it began. Twisting finances saw the C-130K – with its smaller cargo bay but far greater versatility on airfields – take precedence with the Royal Air Force.

(see the English Electric Lightning versus S-300 SAM here

Some 40 years later, the Royal Air Force is on the cusp of introducing an aircraft which combines the best of both worlds – the Belfast’s strategic capacity (loading entire helicopters and armoured vehicles) with the Hercules’ access to semi-prepared airfields in tough conditions. The degree to which an Atlas can accomplish this in an operational theatre will become clear from 2015, when they arrive in to service with the Royal Air Force’s No. 70 Squadron. The Belfast will have been long gone (the last civil charter airframe sits at Cairns Airport), but an interesting contest will brew in the next decade as the Atlas faces off against C-130s (and C-17As, Antonovs and Embraers) for airlift surpremacy.

Payload: A400M 37 tonnes or 81,600lbs; Belfast 35 tonnes or 78,000lbs.

Cargo ‘Box’: A400M: 17.7m long (plus 5.4m on ramp), 4m wide, 3.85m high (4m aft of wing); Belfast: 25.7m long, 4.9m wide, 4.06m high.

Cruise Speed: A400M 421kts; Belfast 292kts.

Range with max payload: A400M 1781nm; Belfast 970nm.

Hexcel's composites ready to fly on the A350 XWB - Reinforced Plastics,"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9oZXhjZWxzLWNvbXBvc2l0ZXMtcmVhZHktdG8tZmx5LW9uLXRoZS1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Figure 1: Composites content in commercial aircraft has now increased to 50 wt%. (Source: Hexcel.)

Figure 2: Primary structures on the A350 XWB (including fuselage panels, keel beam, wing and empennage) are made from Hexcel’s HexPly M21E prepreg reinforced with HexTow IMA carbon fibre. (Source: Hexcel.)

Hexcel’s experience in intermediate modulus carbon fibre was used to design HexTow IMA to Airbus requirements. Intermediate modulus fibre is preferred for modern aircraft structures because it has the highest strength and stiffness. (Source: Hexcel.)

In February 2013 the first A350 XWB (MSN001) emerged for outdoor testing. (Picture © Airbus/P. Pigeyre.)

Hexcel discussed its significant involvement in the A350 XWB programme during a press conference at the JEC Europe 2013 trade show (12-14 March.)

Increased composites use

Hexcel's Commercial Aerospace business accounted for 60% of its 2012 sales of US$1.58 billion. Revenues from this sector have increased at a CAGR of 11% over the period 2004-2012, led by increasing build rates and new, composites-intensive aircraft programmes.

Boeing and Airbus, which account for the majority of Hexcel's commercial aerospace revenues, have both been progressively increasing their adoption of composites over the years (see Figure 1).

Hexcel's contract for Airbus' new A350 XWB wide-body twinjet is the biggest in its history and is expected to generate revenues of US$4-5 billion over the lifetime of the contract.

Hexcel's HexPly® M21E epoxy prepreg made with HexTow® IMA intermediate carbon fibre is used to manufacture the A350 XWB's fuselage panels, keel beam, the entire wing (covers, spars and centre wing box) and empennage (see Figure 2). Hexcel's total material content on each A350 XWB aircraft is expected to be over $4 million.

For Hexcel, the first flight of the A350 XWB will be the culmination of eight years of product development and qualification and investment in new and expanded manufacturing facilities.

Materials development

Hexcel secured the contract to supply carbon fibre materials for the A350 XWB's primary structures in 2008, by developing a complete composite proposal, including prepreg and associated products. This involved development of both fibre and resin technology within the company.

The fibre is one of the most important constituents in any prepreg, explains Paul Mackenzie, Hexcel VP R&T, and being able to provide enhanced intermediate modulus carbon fibre technology to meet the requirements of the A350 programme was an important aspect of Hexcel's development. The result is HexTow IMA, which provides superior mechanical performance including very high tensile strength (850-900 Ksi) and tensile modulus (40-42 Msi).

Hexcel has a long history of supplying structural prepregs to the aerospace industry. Its HexPly M21 and 8552 systems are widely used at Airbus and are employed on the A380 and A400M programmes. Hexcel chemists developed HexPly M21E epoxy resin to provide enhanced toughness and durability, to ensure the propertiest of the fibre are fully optimised in the cured prepreg laminates.

The prepreg is supplied as unidirectional (UD) tape, which can be very finely slit for automated fibre placement (AFP) and automated tape laying (ATL) processes.

Serving a global supply chain

A further challenge of the programme for Hexcel was ensuring the timely supply of materials to the A350’s global supply chain. In addition to Airbus, around 30 Tier 1 manufacturers, including Aerolia, ATK, GKN, Premium Aerotec and Spirit, are producing structures for the A350 using HexPly M21E/IMA prepreg around the world.

""A key reason for our success, beyond the technology, beyond the mechanical performance of our products, is having the right supply chain to provide timely, huge volumes of prepregs to Airbus and its supply chain throughout the globe,"" affirms Thierry Merlot, Hexcel VP & General Manager Europe/MEA/Asia Pacific.

To produce the vast quantities of prepreg required for the A350 XWB programme Hexcel introduced a new model for the cost-effective large-scale production of prepreg. This involved producing resin film in a continuous process to very tight aerial weight tolerances in Duxford, UK. This has improved the quality, accuracy and consistency of the resin film, giving customers greater control of the cured ply thickness in the parts they produce.

Hexcel's contract for Airbus' new A350 XWB wide-body twinjet is the biggest in its history and is expected to generate revenues of US$4-5 billion over the lifetime of the contract.

The resin film from the UK is delivered to Hexcel facilities in France, Spain and Germany, where the company has invested in new prepreg equipment to produce high qualilty UD prepreg, that is split if requried (for ATL and AFP processing). It is then supplied to nearby Airbus facilities and its Tier 1 suppliers throughout Europe and the USA.

Hexcel reports that this supply chain model for prepreg production results in shorter lead times, greater responsiveness, reduced transportation of materials, point of use delivery, less packaging, reduced inventory and less requirement for cold storage space.

Hexcel has significantly expanded it carbon fibre and prepreg production capacity in order to support the A350 programme.

To meet the increased demand for HexTow carbon fibre, new lines have been added at Hexcel’s PAN precursor facility in Decatur, Alabama, USA; new carbon fibre lines have been commissioned in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; and the company built its first European carbon fibre manufacturing plant in Illescas, Spain.

On the prepreg side, in addition to new matrix plants in the UK and prepreg plant expansions in Spain, Germany and France, Hexcel is currently commissioning a new plant at its Salt Lake City, Utah, facility.

New technologies

Mackenzie also talked about two new Hexcel technologies for future aircraft programmes. In addition to prepreg technologies, the company is also developing out of autoclave technologies, and trying to anticipate future demands of aerospace manufacturers.

HiTape®, which was launched at JEC, is an example of this. This is a UD tape reinforcement designed for out of autoclave processing of primary aircraft structures which is said to offer mechanical properties equivalent to prepregs. (See Hexcel HiTape offers out of autoclave processing of primary aircraft structures.)

""It is a UD tape-type product which you are able to get a very high volume fraction, a 58-60% volume fraction you would expect from prepreg technology, but more importantly, you are able to deposit this in a very high deposition rate approaching 50 kilos an hour, “ Mackenzie explains. “After it’s been laid down to provide the preform, it is then infused with a resin system in order to then cure off out of autoclave to make the final part.”

This development will provide cost improvement in terms of being able to process out of an autoclave-type environment, together with a high mechanical performance.

Mackenzie also highlights HexMC, a carbon fibre/epoxy moulding compound designed for compression moulding for specific point design parts. (See HexMC carbon fibre moulding compound for high volume aircraft parts.)

More Hexcel materials on the A350 In addition to the primary structure, Hexcel is supplying a number of other HexPly prepregs for other structures on the A350 XWB. HexPly 8552 woven and UD prepregs, HexPly M65 woven BMI prepreg and HexPly 914/ASC woven prepreg are used in the engines and nacelles along with Hexcel's engineered core and Acousti-Cap® broadband noise reducing honeycomb. The belly fairing is made from HexPly M26T and F593 woven carbon prepregs, and HexPly M59XF expanded copper foil prepreg. HexWeb® Engineered Core packages are used extensively in the wing leading and trailing edges and ailerons. Other Hexcel products used on the aircraft include HexFlow® RTM 6 infusion resin and HexForce® engineered reinforcements for out of autoclave structures, Redux® adhesives and lightning strike protection solutions.

""It is a chopped fibre product, but it is based on a prepreg system, and as a result has mechanical performance that is certainly excellent, and provides the sort of mechanical performance that can actually then go on to replace titanium fixtures which it is targeting to replace,” MacKenzie reports. “So from HexMC, you’re looking at a number of different types of applications for clips, for brackets, for pans to static guide lanes, and this has also been established, and has been used both on 787, and is also being now considered for use on A350.”

""So this is another technology that Hexcel is developing in order to provide further design options for our aerospace customers to move away from metal and metal technology,” he concludes.

First flight

The A350 XWB is scheduled to take its first flight this summer. Launch customer Qatar Airways is expected to receive its first A350 in mid-2014 and introduce it into passenger service soon afterwards.

Airbus has sold 617 aircraft so far. The smallest of the three models, the A350-800 (270 passengers), has a list price of US$254.3 million. ♦

China to be biggest market for Airbus A380 - People's Daily,"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHA6Ly9lbi5wZW9wbGUuY24vOTA3NzgvODIyNDg2My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China will be the biggest single market for the A380 aircraft, Airbus SAS' super jumbo, the European aircraft manufacturer's chief said on Friday.



Airbus forecast that China will need more than 200 aircraft with 500 or more seats in the next 20 years, and the A380 is the main aircraft in this category, said Fabrice Bregier, president and CEO of Airbus.



""For A380 market growth, we are chasing 5 percent per year at the world level and 10 percent in China,"" he added.



As Chinese air traffic develops, the nation's airlines will operate more international routes, which are suitable for the A380, he said.



The period between 2011 and 2015 is a golden age for China's civil aviation industry, said Li Jiaxiang, head of Civil Aviation Administration of China.



Passenger air traffic will reach 450 million person-trips and investment in civil aviation will exceed 1.5 trillion yuan ($243.15 billion) by the end of 2015, according to the administration.



The super jumbo's market in China is still in its infancy, with only five in the country, belonging to China Southern Airlines Co Ltd.



Hong Kong Airlines, a subsidiary of HNA Group, is reportedly considering changing its 10 A380 orders to smaller aircraft. The carrier plans to enlarge its fleet with A330 and A320 aircraft, as it is cautious about long-haul routes, the airline said earlier.



""It will be long term growth and we cannot expect our Chinese customers to move immediately in large numbers to the A380, "" said Bregier.



A new aircraft program is aimed at the market for the next 30-year period, he said, and new aircraft usually lose money at first. The A380 program will be in profit from 2016 according to Airbus' plan.



""Industry cooperation between Airbus and Chinese aircraft manufacturers will continue increasing and it will be more than $500 million in 2016,"" he said.



Airbus also can expect more orders from China as the negative impact on Airbus' business in China from the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme is fading.



China Aviation Supply Holding Company signed an agreement with Airbus SAS for the purchase of 60 Airbus aircraft, which includes 42 A320 Family aircraft and 18 A330 aircraft on Thursday.



It is the second time that Airbus received large orders from China after the ETS issue and the A330 orders may include some orders, which were suspended after the ETS issue in 2012, business insiders said.

The Celeste seat will be offered to carriers as part of the A350 XWB Catalogue, which also includes a premium economy seat manufactured by Zodiac Seats.

According to Airbus, EADS-Sogerma has optimised its Celeste seats for the forthcoming long-haul aircraft, offering “an innovative cradle seat which provides premium economy passengers with a high level of comfort at an efficient pitch”.

Qatar Airways is the launch customers for the Airbus A350 XWB, and this week the carrier announced plans to fit its A350 aircraft with the same On Air mobile phone and wifi technology as that already provided on its A320 and B787 aircraft (see online news April 8).

Qatar has a total of 80 A350s on order, with the first delivery expected next year.

In February Airbus confirmed that it has dropped plans to use lithium ion batteries in its forthcoming A350 XWB aircraft, following ""continuing uncertainty over the battery issues with Boeing Dreamliner aircraft"". The manufacturer has instead reverted to ""proven and mastered nickel cadmium main batteries for its A350 XWB programme at Entry into Service"".

Spirit Airlines Celebrates Earth Day as it Begins Flying New Airbus A320 with Sharklets - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wNC9nZXQtcGF5LXJhbnQtZWNvbm9teS1jbGFzcy9zcGlyaXQtYTMyMC13aXRoLXNoYXJrbGV0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo and Press Release from Spirit:

Sharklets are Airbus’ new wingtip device that improves the aircraft’s

aerodynamics which significantly reduces fuel burn by up to four

percent and lowers emissions. The technology reduces annual greenhouse

gas emissions by approximately 1,000 tons of CO2 per aircraft — that’s

equivalent to taking 200 cars off the road! Made from light-weight

composites and measuring eight feet in height, Sharklets also offer the

flexibility of adding an additional 100 nautical miles range or

increased payload capability of up to 450 kilograms. In addition, they

reduce engine maintenance costs and increase operational efficiencies,

including improved take-off performance, better rate of climb and

optimum altitude.

“We are thrilled to be celebrating Earth Day by operating our new

Airbus A320 with new Sharklet technology,” said Spirit’s President and

CEO Ben Baldanza. “Spirit is proud to be doing our part to make travel

not only more affordable for our customers, but at the same time green.

From our modern all-Airbus fleet and eco-friendly seating configuration

among other innovations, and now Sharklets, Spirit has taken serious

measures to reduce our fuel consumption and be more eco-conscious,

while at the same time continuing to offer our customers the lowest

fares in the industry.”

“With the debut of their new Sharklets, Spirit is showing it cares for

the planet and the pocketbook,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating

Officer — Customers, Airbus. “By reducing fuel consumption, Sharklets

help the environment and the airline’s bottom line — it’s great Spirit

is taking advantage of the win-win benefits of Sharklets on the A320

Family.”

As part of its green efforts, several years ago Spirit made the

conscious decision to transition to a fleet of new, fuel-efficient

Airbus aircraft and enhanced them with an eco-friendly seating

configuration. In fact, Spirit burns far less fuel per passenger than

its competitors. Its A320 aircraft provide an incredible 89.4 passenger

miles per gallon.* Spirit has also signed an agreement with Airbus for

an order which includes their latest A320neo (new engine option)

aircraft, which will be even more fuel efficient than Spirit’s current

A320s. In addition, Spirit’s “Bring Less, Pay Less” baggage program has

led to a reduction in bags carried per passenger and resulted in Spirit

using the equivalent of nearly six million gallons less fuel in the

past year."
EPIC PHOTOS: Emirates and Qantas Airbus A380’s Fly in Formation - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 03 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNC9lcGljLXBob3Rvcy1lbWlyYXRlcy1hbmQtcWFudGFzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwcy1mbHktaW4tZm9ybWF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Easter Sunday in Sydney, many families spent time to calm down the sugar loaded children while the sun hides amongst the clouds in the southern autumn (fall). Yet in the sky, a unique event happened, never seen before.

To commemorate the start of the partnership between Qantas & Emirates the two airlines decided to hold a special event. At 10:30am, at 1500ft above the Sydney Harbor Bridge an A380 from Qantas, flew in formation with a second A380 from Emirates. This is the first time in aviation history that not only did two A380s flew in formation, but also two from different airlines.

’œThe sight of two of the world’s great airlines flying two of the world’s largest aircraft so close together over Sydney Harbor is a once in a lifetime opportunity,’ said Captain Green Chief pilot for Qantas.

Pilots from both airlines have conducted dozens of special simulator training sessions since January this year. Emirates pilots came to Australia earlier this month to conduct joint sessions in Qantas’ A380 simulator in Sydney and conducted several more practice runs over the past few days.

As VH-OQF (from Qantas) & A6-EDY (from Emirates) flew over Sydney Harbor they used the call sign ’œSeismic’ because Emirates President Tim Clark said ’œthe partnership between Qantas and Emirates will cause a seismic shift in global aviation.’

The Qantas & Emirates partnership is game changing, as it sees the end of the dominant force on the ’œKangaroo Route’ from London to Australia via Singapore. That traditional route was maintained by an agreement between British Airways (IAG) and Qantas for over 15 years. Although Qantas & British Airways are oneworld partner airlines the joint agreement allowed them to coordinate pricing, services and flights between the UK & Australia. However when that agreement ended on the 31st of March, the Emirates partnership began.

With Qantas flying their A380s to London via Dubai, it allows Qantas customers access to 70 destinations in Europe with only one stop over the previous two. Emirates doesn’t come out of the deal empty handed, as they get access to the Qantas domestic network, which is by far the most comprehensive in Australia. Frequent flyer benefits and some on-board services have been aligned between the two carriers making this a true powerhouse to contend with.

I can just imagine standing by the shoreline on Sydney Harbor seeing these two large aircraft flying in formation and being surrounded by a stunned crowd of AvGeeks, tourists & locals. It is only too bad that the sun and blue sky were not out.

The airline is expecting to take delivery of their first double-decker airliner in July of this year and will first use the plane on short-haul routes for training and then on their London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) route starting on October 15th. The second A380 will be placed on their LHR to Hong Kong in November (tickets for both flights are on sale now).

BA’s A380 will be configured to hold 469 passengers in four cabins: First Class (14), Club World (97), World Traveller Plus (55) and World Traveller (303).

The airline has 12 A380s on order, which are expected to all be delivered by 2016.

’œThis will be a very special premiere,” Keith Williams, British Airways’ chief executive, said. “The A380 is a great aircraft that has been developed with huge amounts of British engineering ingenuity. London and Los Angeles are two world-leading cities, and we are proud to be the first airline to connect them with the A380.’

The installation of weapons under the wings provides new operational capabilities to the C295 MPA allowing the aircraft to perform new missions demanding by the customers. In the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role, the C295 is already in-service carrying the MK46 torpedo.

This flight was the last of a series of trials performed in a joint Airbus Military – MBDA collaboration to validate the aerodynamic integration of Marte on C295, its handling qualities and performance tests. This successful trial provides further proof of the operational versatility of the Marte missile and clearly establishes it as the benchmark weapon in the medium weight anti-ship missile sector.

The Marte Mk2/S is a fire-and-forget, all-weather, medium-range sea-skimming anti-ship missile. The weapon is already integrated on the AW-101 and the NFH (Naval NH90) helicopters in service with the Italian Navy and integration activities for the Marte ER on the Eurofighter Typhoon are currently underway.

The missile is equipped with inertial mid-course guidance and radar homing terminal guidance, and capable of destroying small vessels and heavily damaging major vessels. The missile has a weight of 310 Kg and is 3.85 m long."

Made from lightweight composites, the 2.4m tall parts offer the flexibility of adding some 100nm more range or increasing payload capabilities of up to 992lb.

The wing-tip units enable carriers to reduce fuel burn by up to 4% on long-haul routes, according to Airbus.

The A320 is designed to benefit from required navigation performance (RNP) allowing the aircraft to fly precisely along predefined routes by using onboard navigation systems, which is particularly useful for operations at high-altitude airports that are constrained by mountains such as Kathmandu



Nepal Airlines managing director Madan Kharel said: ""Adding the A320 to our fleet will help us capitalise on tourism growth and enhance our network using the most fuel-efficient aircraft available.""

""Adding the A320 to our fleet will help us capitalise on tourism growth and enhance our network using the most fuel-efficient aircraft available.""

Airbus customers COO John Leahy said the A320 is the most capable and efficient aircraft that can serve challenging airports such as Kathmandu

""The Sharklets will deliver 4% less fuel burn, so for a landlocked nation such as Nepal these aircraft will be a lifeline and economic driver for prosperity,"" Leahy added.

NAC was established on 1 July 1958 through the enactment of the Nepal Airlines Corporation Act 1962.

Currently, the carrier operates flights to four international destinations and 25 domestic locations in the Himalayas.

The A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321 and is recognised as the benchmark single-aisle aircraft line.

To date, more than 9,400 A320 aircraft have been sold to in excess of 385 customers and operators worldwide.

British Airways has ordered 18 new Airbus A350 aircraft as part of a move to phase out a fleet of 30 Boeing aircraft over the next 10 years.

The order, announced by BA's parent company International Airlines Group (IAG), allows for an option of a further 18 A350 aeroplanes.

As well as its new Airbus aircraft, IAG plans to place firm orders on 18 Boeing 787s, which together will be used to replace BA's fleet of 30 Boeing 747-400 planes between 2017 and 2023.

IAG also said it was talking to Airbus and Boeing about supplying aircraft for its Spanish arm, Iberia.

The order for the Airbus A350s will be a welcome boost to Britain's aviation industry.

The aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, and the deal is worth 1.6 billion US dollars (£1.04 billion), the company said.

Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said: ""The A350-1000 will bring many benefits to our fleet. Its size and range will be an excellent fit for our existing network and, with lower unit costs, there is an opportunity to operate a new range of destinations profitably.

""This will not only bring greater flexibility to our network but also more choice for our customers.

""This order will also secure jobs in Britain and Spain. The A350's wings are made in Britain while its horizontal tail plane, horizontal tail plane boxes and lower wing covers are made in Spain. Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines are assembled in Britain.""

The order for the A350 aircraft follows BA's decision in 2007 to buy 12 Airbus A380s, the first of which will be delivered this summer.

""This is an important announcement from one of the world's most respected and influential airline brands,"" said John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer.

""The A380 and the A350 are perfectly matched for greener long-haul operations and demonstrate environmental leadership.

""We are simply delighted that British Airways has chosen the A350 to spread its global wings and its iconic livery.""

MBDA Marte missile release trial from airbus military C295 | Press Release | MBDA - MBDA,"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1iZGEtc3lzdGVtcy5jb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbWJkYS1tYXJ0ZS1taXNzaWxlLXJlbGVhc2UtdHJpYWwtZnJvbS1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnktYzI5NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military and MBDA have successfully demonstrated the release of an instrumented Marte MK2/S anti-ship inert missile installed under the wing of the C295 maritime patrol aircraft. This flight was the last of a series of trials performed in a joint Airbus Military – MBDA collaboration to validate the aerodynamic integration of Marte on C295, its handling qualities and performance tests.

The installation of weapons under the wings provides new operational capabilities to the C295 MPA allowing the aircraft to perform new missions demanding by the customers. In the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role, the C295 is already in-service carrying the MK46 torpedo.

This successful trial provides further proof of the operational versatility of the Marte missile and clearly establishes it as the benchmark weapon in the medium weight anti-ship missile sector.

The Marte Mk2/S is already integrated on the AW-101 and the NFH (Naval NH90) helicopters in service with the Italian Navy and integration activities for the Marte ER on the Eurofighter Typhoon are currently underway.

The MBDA Marte MK2/S missile is a fire-and-forget, all-weather, medium-range sea-skimming anti-ship weapon system, equipped with inertial mid-course guidance and radar homing terminal guidance, and capable of destroying small vessels and heavily damaging major vessels. The missile has a weight of 310 kg and is 3.85 m long."

Daimler, whose products include Mercedes-Benz cars, has said it will use the proceeds from the sale of 7.5% stake to focus on its auto business and pay out dividends to shareholders.

""The proceeds from this sale are contributing positively to our free cash flow this year and in addition to the earnings from our ongoing businesses, will also support our policy of stable dividends,"" its financial director, Bodo Uebber, said in a statement.

Daimler was one of the prime movers in launching EADS in 2000, as European firms joined forces to create an aerospace giant to rival Boeing in the US. But the German carmaker has seen its core business outpaced by rivals, such as Volkswagen's Audi and BMW, leading it to reduce its original 30% stake in EADS.

Last year a merger between EADS and the UK's aerospace firm BAE Systems was thwarted at the 11th hour, when the German chancellory vetoed the deal. The aftermath has seen Daimler and French media conglomerate Lagardere sell down their stakes in a streamlining of EADS's complex shareholding structure, which is designed to hold a balance of power between the French and German governments.

""The EADS stake sale secures a stable dividend payment for 2013,"" Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Commerzbank, told Bloomberg news agency. ""It's better for Daimler to invest the money in the company's core business or to spend it to the benefit of the shareholders in the form of a dividend payment."""

British Airways said parent group IAG, which owns also Spanish carrier Iberia, had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to buy 18 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft with an option to purchase 18 more.

Each plane has a catalogue price of $332.1 million, according to European planemaker Airbus’ website, though airlines tend to receive significant discounts on bulk orders.

“After a thorough selection process, International Airlines Group (IAG), and British Airways have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to buy 18 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft plus 18 options, as part of the airline’s on-going long-haul aircraft fleet renewal and modernisation strategy,"" a statement said.

“IAG, owner of both British Airways and Iberia, has also secured commercial terms and delivery slots that could lead to firm orders for Iberia. Firm orders will only be made when Iberia is in a position to grow profitably, having restructured and reduced its cost base,"" it added.

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said adding the A350-1000 to British Airways’s fleet would “bring many benefits.""

He added: “Its size and range will be an excellent fit for our existing network and, with lower unit costs, there is an opportunity to operate a new range of destinations profitably. This will not only bring greater flexibility to our network but also more choice for our customers.""

Earlier this month, IAG said it had reached an agreement with Airbus’ US rival Boeing Co. to buy 18 of its 787 Dreamliners.

The move is a show of confidence in the plane, which was grounded around the world in January owing to problems with its battery system.

IAG meanwhile plunged into an annual net loss of 943 million euros in 2012 on severe financial strains at its Spanish arm Iberia and owing to a soaring fuel bill.

IAG is cutting more than 3,800 jobs at Iberia as the airline struggles as a result of Spain’s weak economic backdrop.

BA and Iberia merged in January 2011 in a tie-up aimed at slashing one another’s costs, as a sharp economic downturn and rise of low-cost competitors sparked steep losses for traditional carriers.

Manufacturer Airbus is offering two inch larger aisle seats on its A320 jets

But window and centre seats will both shrink to make space



Airplane manufacturers are making seats for overweight passengers who are too big to comfortably fit in normal sized seats.

Airbus is offering airlines the option of installing extra-wide seats on A320 jets to cope with what it describes as 'trends in demographics'.

The extra-wide seats will measure 20 inches across instead of the standard 18 inches, and will likely be installed only as aisle seats.

Are you sitting comfortably? Airbus is offering airlines larger seats for obese people on its A320 planes

Window and middle seats will each lose an inch of width to generate the extra space.

Airbus is selling the idea as an innovative way to 'meet passenger needs' - even though two-thirds of passengers will have to make do with less space.

The plans were announced this week at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany.

The company first suggested the idea last year, but a poll back in July by the Skyscanner website found 80 per cent of British fliers were opposed to losing seat space to accommodate larger passengers.

Airbus aircraft interiors marketing manager Stefanie Von Linstow told Flightglobal: 'Passengers in the window seat are already happy and those in the centre seat might not be willing to pay as much for less width.

'The aisle seat seems the most attractive for the concept.'

Room to breathe: The manufacturer is offering the larger seats on its A320 model

Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price.

Chief Executive Chris Langton said this was the 'fairest' way to charge travellers while addressing the obesity crisis - an acute problem in Samoa's Pacific region.

Another carrier, Southwest Airlines requires its 'Customers of Size' who do not fit between the armrests to purchase another seat.

In a November 2012 report on the issue, Dr Bharat Bhatta from Norway's Sogn og Fjordane University College said that a 'fat tax' is the way to price tickets 'correctly'."

BA has agreed to buy 18 of the largest A350-1000 model, which carries a list price of A$308m per plane, in a deal worth a potential A$5.5bn.

Each jet can cater for up to 350 passengers across business class, premium economy and economy cabins.

Although Airbus expects to debut the A350-900 in the middle of next year, with the smaller A350-800 in mid-2016 and the stretched A350-1000 following in mid-2017.

Like the Boeing 787, the A350 uses mainly composite carbon-fibre rather than metal in an attempt to reduce weight, increase fuel efficiency and also boost passenger-experience attributes such as providing lower cabin pressure, higher humidity and larger windows.

However, the supersized A350-1000 is a closer match to the Boeing 777-300ER which BA already operated and recently introduced on its Sydney-London route.

Other airlines backing the Airbus A350 include launch customer Qatar Airways, which has signed up for 80 aircraft; Emirates Airline, which has inked a deal for 70 planes; and Cathay Pacific's pledge to buy 36 A350s.

BA also has 40 of Boeing's 787 on order, making it one of relatively few airlines in the world to adopt a mixed fleet of both 787s and A350s.

Mayor to pitch Iqaluit's cold weather test potential at Paris Air Show - Nunatsiaq News,"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnVuYXRzaWFxLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2FydGljbGUvNjU2NzRJcWFsdWl0X3RvX3VwaG9sZF9pdHNfY2FzZV9hc19haXJjcmFmdF90ZXN0X2NlbnRyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“We want to keep Iqaluit front and foremost in the customer’s mind”

By PETER VARGA

Iqaluit Mayor John Graham will put his expertise as former airport manager to work for the Nunavut capital again this summer, when he heads up a delegation to the Paris Air Show.

The mayor plans to promote Iqaluit as “the world’s premiere cold-weather aerospace test centre,” Graham said.

He’s done that often in the past but this time he’ll do it in the name of the City of Iqaluit, with a delegation organized by city council’s economic development committee.

This delegation is a first for the city. Representatives from territorial and federal governments have promoted the Iqaluit airport in past years, but had no plans to do so in 2013.

“We want to keep Iqaluit front and foremost in the customer’s mind,” Graham said.

As airport manager from 1996 to 2012, Graham hosted cold-weather test runs of several new models of aircraft by Boeing and Airbus, starting with the Boeing 777 in 1996.

His presence at the Paris show in 2005, 2007 and 2009 helped keep Iqaluit on the radar of large and medium-sized manufacturers from Europe and North America.

The main purpose of his first visit to the show in 2005 was largely to persuade Airbus to test its giant two-level A380 at the airport.

“That was my goal,” he said. “It had never flown to North America. And I thought it would be a major milestone for Iqaluit airport, for Nunavut and actually in Canadian aviation history.”

Aircraft testing brings much business to the city during such missions and offers a rare chance to promote Iqaluit on the global stage, said Graham, which is the city’s prime motivation.

Even so, he is quick to point out that the idea of attending the show was not his — but the work of the city’s economic development committee and its chairman, Coun. Mark Morrissey.

The idea took root when Airbus was in the city earlier this year to test a military plane and a new engine on the A380. On meeting members of the project, Morrissey and the mayor found “there is tremendous economic spin-off to the community, as a general observation,” said Graham.

The delegates estimated their team typically spent up to half a million dollars on such large missions in total, including all routine costs to run the mission at the airport as well as accommodation for mission members.

“As a municipal corporation, the city receives nothing from these guys landing,” said Morrissey. “But there’s a clear benefit to the local businesses.”

Morrissey and the city’s development committee found a study from 2005, which estimated that every dollar spent on promoting Iqaluit at the Paris Air Show netted a return of $30 in business to the city.

Attracting that business takes consistent effort, said Morrissey, and in a year when the territorial government has not lined up a delegation as in the past, the city stands to benefit from a mayor with experience doing it.

“I don’t think he had planned on being part of it,” Morrissey laughed. “But to us (city council) it just made absolute sense. He’s been there, he’s done it. He’s got the existing relationship with these companies — so we wanted to use that.”

Graham and Morrissey will be part of a delegation that will include two members of Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services, who represent the local aerospace industry. Also expected are two representatives of the territorial government.

As well maintain the interest of Boeing and Airbus in Iqaluit, this year’s goal is to draw smaller firms to the territorial capital. These include manufacturers of civilian and military aircraft such as Eurocopter, Dassault Aviation of France, Embraer from Brazil, and Canada’s own Bombardier.

“An important part here is to maintain the competitive advantage that we currently have,” said Morrissey.

Airport installations throughout the world are also vying for test contracts, he said, including sites in Sweden, Russia, and the United States, not to mention others closer to home, in Manitoba and Labrador.

A city that owes its existence to the creation of an airbase in the Second World War seems a natural fit. Its location, selected by the U.S. Air Force at the time, was purposefully chosen as a refuelling point on the route to Europe from North America.

To this day it remains relatively close to large aerospace industries abroad, said Graham, and on the pathways of major transcontinental air routes.

Besides the key advantage of its predictable cold, dry climate, which suits well for avionics testing, Iqaluit is within five hours’ flying distance from France – the site of much of Europe’s aerospace industry. It is also on the “High North Atlantic Track,” said Graham – the pathway taken to Europe from major North American cities, and to Asia from cities on the Eastern Seaboard.

“It’s a true polar route,” he said. “Like from New York to New Delhi – right across the North Pole.”

Hosted at Le Bourget Airport, just north of the French capital, the Paris Air Show is the world’s oldest and largest such event. This year’s 50th edition, June 17 to 23, will welcome 151,000 trade visitors and more than 2,100 international exhibitors.

“It’s the world’s number one aviation event. It’s absolutely massive,” said Graham.

City council estimates the event will cost the city $40,000, most of which covers the city’s two representatives, and the city’s booth at the show will be subsidized by the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada. The city is also working with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Industry and Trade to arrange meetings with manufacturers and trade commissioners of other countries.

Aircraft testing has proven to be a sustainable industry for the city so far, said Graham — not to mention “a welcome shot in the arm for the economy in the middle of the winter.”"

China Southern: Airbus A380 flights from Sydney in October - Executive Traveller,"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vY2hpbmEtc291dGhlcm4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmxpZ2h0cy1mcm9tLXN5ZG5leS1pbi1vY3RvYmVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China Southern will launch its flagship Airbus A380 on Sydney-Guangzhou flights from October 27.

The superjumbo will slot into the daily CZ325/326 service, which departs Sydney at 9.50am to reach Guangzhou at 5.30pm.

Further down the track Sydney is also tipped to see China Southern's Boeing 787, the airline says.

Melbourne's daily CZ service to Guangzhou will be upgraded to an Airbus A330-300 by the end of October.

Travellers continuing to London on China Southern's 'Canton Route' will have the option of breaking their journey at Guangzhou for up to 72 hours without a visa, under new transit permit rules to be introduced later this year.

""We are absolutely thrilled that Australians will soon be able to stop over in this vibrant city for up to 72 hours to try some authentic Cantonese Yum Cha, enjoy the local culture and shop til they drop"" said China Southern Executive Vice President Mr Chen Gang.

No 'A380 all the way' on the Canton Route

However, Chen said that China Southern was currently unable to offer an A380 service between Guangzhou and London due to the airline having only five A380s in its fleet.

""We have more Airbus A330s and Boeing 777-300s"" than A380s, Chen told Australian Business Traveller, and also tipped that the Boeing 787 might also find its way onto the London leg.

China Southern currently runs only one international A380 service, that being between Guangzhou and Los Angeles.

The airline's other A380 routes are all within China, including the world's shortest A380 trip of just over two hours between Guangzhou and Shanghai.

Inside China Southern's Airbus A380

CZ's A380 represents a substantial upgrade from the Airbus A330s currently used between Sydney and Guangzhou with improvements from tip to tail.

At the front of the main deck you'll find the first class Platinum Private Suites. These SQ-style suites are ensconced by shoulder-height walls and refreshingly bling-free, outfitted in a calm and elegant royal purple.

The eight suites on board are laid out across two rows, in a 1-2-1 configuration, with the slide-down divider between the middle pairs allowing for a chat with your travelling companion or colleague en route.

The seat controls and extra-large table are found in the handy armrest, which is itself a pleasing size for marshalling all your first class gear.

Most of the upper deck is given over to the airline's confusingly-named business class offering, which China Southern dubs as 'First Class' – good luck trying to swing that one past your company's travel manager when it comes to booking a business trip!

Frequent flyers may be familiar with these types of seats – they're made by EADS Sogerma and adopt a staggered layout with direct aisle access for every passenger.

Simple and clean lines are the order of the day once more for China Southern, with a calm and rather corporate light blue seat and off-white plastic surrounding shell.

The centre pairs (E and F seats on China Southern) are the seats to pick if you're travelling with your other half, and the seats to skip if you're not.

We'd also suggest avoiding the aisle seats on the side and in the middle (C and H on the CZ seatmap) skip since your elbows will be right out in the aisles, ready to be banged by the first trolley or passenger that goes past.

That all makes the A and K window seats, which have a large armrest/cocktail table between you and the rest of the plane, plus a few inches extra bed length, the ones to snag.

And, of course, you get the elbow room on the other side from the window storage bins – all up, the extra surface area makes for a very practical 'office in the sky'.

Looking more closely at the seat, you'll find the controls sensibly up where the contents of your pockets won't brush up against them.

A water bottle holder sits in the corner, with a full universal power point at a handy spot right next to your arm.

We like the clever recessed cupholder/plateholder too: no glasses sliding around here.

Economy class (refreshingly named 'Economy Class') is towards the back of the main cabin in the usual 3-4-3 seat layout.

If you're flying to China in the cheap sets we suggest booking into in the smaller upstairs economy cabin: this sports a roomier 2-4-2 layout with extra elbow and surface space plus more personal storage area for passengers in window seats.

(The seats you want are rows 70 through 78 - avoid row 79, which is a middle block of four seats flanked by the toilets, galley and crew area.)

Cathay Pacific's business class refresh for Airbus A340s - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vY2F0aGF5LXBhY2lmaWMtcy1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1yZWZyZXNoLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTM0MHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cathay Pacific will embark on a refresh of the high-walled herringbone business class seats across its Airbus A340-300 fleet, along with the introduction of a new premium economy cabin.

All 11 of the long-range A340s – which fly from Cathay's Hong Kong hub to several cities including Auckland, Amsterdam and Paris – are set for the refit, with Paris flights CX279/278 first on the list from mid-July.

The upgraded A340s will add Amsterdam and Auckland to their roster in October.

The first-generation flatbed seats, which Cathay codenamed FB1 or Hercules – although less kind travellers have dubbed 'cubicle class' (or, less charitably, 'coffin class') – will be refreshed ""with new colour and trim as per the 747s"" Toby Smith, Cathay’s General Manager of Product, confirmed to Australian Business Traveller earlier today.

""The refresh lightens up the cabin and has a much calmer, more relaxing feel and gives the herringbone seat a new lease of life. We will be progressively retiring the A340s as we take on more Boeing 777s and the Airbus 350.""

The A350's early 2016 arrival into the CX fleet could also see the debut of Cathay's third-generation or FB3 business class seat, Smith says – although he admits that topping today's highly-regarded design will be a hard task.

“I think that’s the challenge for us, what do you do next? I mean, you can’t get flatter than flat!” Smith laughs. “You might make it a little bit wider or a little bit longer, but if you’ve got a bed that takes someone who’s 6’ 2”, 6’ 3”, that’s probably going to be good enough.”

However, while the upgraded Airbus A340s will boast a refresh at the pointy end plus new premium economy seating just behind, the bulk of the plane will still sport the older and infamously uncomfortable 'fixed shell' design seats which declare a jihad on your lower back.

Cathay Pacific confirmed to Australian Business Traveller that the airline's new long-haul economy seat would not be included in the refit.

Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the A340 upgrade would see the current business class seats replaced by Cathay's newest business class product. This was based on incorrect information supplied by a Cathay Pacific spokesperson. Cathay Pacific has since advised that the existing business class cabin will be refreshed rather than replaced, and we've updated this article to reflect that.
