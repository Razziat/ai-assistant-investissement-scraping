"Delta celebrates 100th U.S.-produced Airbus A321, reaffirms commitment to domestic job growth - Delta News Hub","Tue, 09 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5kZWx0YS5jb20vZGVsdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy0xMDB0aC11cy1wcm9kdWNlZC1haXJidXMtYTMyMS1yZWFmZmlybXMtY29tbWl0bWVudC1kb21lc3RpYy1qb2ItZ3Jvd3Ro0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta, Airbus and government leaders gathered in Mobile, Alabama, this week to celebrate the production of Delta’s 100th U.S.-produced Airbus A321.

Delta’s commitment to its cutting-edge fleet was on full display this week in Mobile, Alabama, where the airline celebrated the production of its 100th U.S.-produced A321 from manufacturing partner, Airbus.

Airbus launched its first U.S. production facility in 2015, with just under 400 employees and Delta received its first aircraft from the Mobile facility in 2016. Because of Delta’s strong partnership with Airbus, the Mobile facility now supports more than 1,600 jobs.

The A321 is central to Delta’s fleet strategy, which focuses on delivering next-level customer service and some of the most fuel-efficient aircraft made today.

“I am grateful for the ongoing partnership between Delta and Airbus, which continues to support good-paying jobs that help families live their American Dream, bolster local communities, and strengthen the regional economy,” said U.S. Senator Katie Britt. “This landmark achievement is only possible because of the hard work, dedication and skill of Airbus employees across Alabama.”

Though the production of Delta’s 100th A321 from Mobile is a milestone celebration, Delta received its actual 100th aircraft from the facility last fall.

“Delta’s premium travel experience on our state-of-the-art fleet is made possible by manufacturing partners like Airbus,” said Kristen Bojko, V.P. -- Fleet for Delta Air Lines. “Delta’s 100th U.S.-produced A321 aircraft is a significant milestone that reinforces our commitment to flying more fuel-efficient aircraft while investing in quality U.S.-based jobs.”

“Delta has had a truly essential role in the growth story of Airbus in Mobile and manufacturing in the United States,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairman and CEO, Airbus Americas, Inc. “Delta has recognized our commitment to providing modern, efficient and passenger-friendly aircraft to our customers. It’s particularly special when we can deliver their aircraft from right here in the U.S.A.”

Delta has a long history of partnering with manufacturers with production operations in the U.S. Delta recently announced a Boeing order for 100 737-10 aircraft, which will be assembled in Renton, Washington.

Article Aircraft Delta adds state-of-the-art, fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX to fleet The aircraft will be 20%-30% more fuel efficient than the retiring Delta planes it will replace, making the agreement an important step in Delta’s journey toward a sustainable future for aviation.

Both the A321 and 737-10 provide an elevated and fuel-efficient travel experience and represents thousands of domestic jobs. Both additions to Delta’s fleet play a large role in its initiative to elevate and reshape the future of travel in the air and on the ground.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9960147142410278}",positive,0.9960147142410278,1

Lufthansa and Airbus mark delivery of 600th Lufthansa aircraft at Airbus's Hamburg-Finkenwerder site - newsroom.lufthansagroup.com,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmx1ZnRoYW5zYWdyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9sdWZ0aGFuc2EtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1tYXJrLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLTYwMHRoLWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1haXJjcmFmdC1hdC1haXJidXNzLWhhbWJ1cmctZmlua2Vud2VyZGVyLXNpdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The delivery to Lufthansa of its first Airbus A300B2 on February 9, 1976 laid the foundation for a strong partnership within European civil aviation that has now extended almost 50 years. With more than ten different Airbus aircraft types supplied since then to almost every air operator in the Lufthansa Group, today saw the 600th such aircraft – an Airbus A321neo – handed over to Lufthansa in a formal ceremony at Airbus’s Hamburg-Finkenwerder site.

Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Lufthansa Group Executive Board:

“Lufthansa and Airbus are united by a very special partnership. Ever since Airbus’s creation, we have enjoyed close and trusting collaborations on a wide range of research projects and new developments. Lufthansa has also served no fewer than four times as Airbus’s launching customer for a new aircraft type, most recently for the A320neo family that is proving such a success. Lufthansa has ordered every family of aircraft that Airbus has developed over the past five decades. And more than 90 per cent of the 600 Airbuses that we have taken delivery of during that time are still in Lufthansa Group service today. We also wish to welcome our 700th Airbus to our fleet as part of Lufthansa’s centennial celebrations in 2026.”

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO:

“Lufthansa and Airbus have been partners ever since we delivered the first Lufthansa A300 back in February 1976. Since then, Lufthansa has taken delivery of an Airbus aircraft an average of every month – 600 of them in almost 50 years! No other airline group has received more of our aircraft to date. My particular thanks, on behalf of everyone at Airbus, go to all the teams at Lufthansa for all their confidence and trust. We look forward to the next 50 years of our partnership and our shared commitment to the goal of sustainable air travel.”

The story to date

Lufthansa signed its first purchase agreement with Airbus for three A300B2s in 1975 and received its first such aircraft from Europe’s new manufacturer seven months later on February 9, 1976. Subsequent years saw the first deliveries of further Airbus types: the A310 in 1983, followed by the A300-600 in 1987. The first Airbus A320 to join the Lufthansa fleet was delivered in October 1989. Over 370 aircraft of the A320 family are in service today with the various airlines of the Lufthansa Group. The first A340 followed in 1993; and just one year later the Lufthansa Airbus fleet passed the 100-aircraft mark. The A330 followed in 2004; and in 2010 the A380 – the world’s largest passenger aircraft – joined the Lufthansa long-haul fleet.

Lufthansa has also served as launching customer for a new Airbus type on four occasions to date: for the A310, the A340, the A220 and – in 2016 –A320neo. Not only the Airbus A320 family is a cornerstone of today’s Lufthansa fleet: the A350-900, which first arrived in 2016, has also become a key component in the Lufthansa long-haul fleet, and the Lufthansa Group is the world’s third-biggest A350 customer.

600th Airbus named ‘Münster’

The 600th Airbus aircraft to be delivered to Lufthansa, which bears the registration D-AIEQ, is an Airbus A321neo. Seating 215 passengers, the A321neo is a state-of-the-art and fuel-efficient short- and medium-haul twinjet that has been in Lufthansa service since 2019. D-AIEQ has been named ‘Münster’ after the German city.

Partners in sustainability, too

Lufthansa and Airbus attach particular importance to their collaborations on the sustainability and the research & development fronts. Over the last three decades, the Lufthansa Group has equipped several of its long-haul Airbus aircraft with instruments to conduct climate and weather research. In addition to three such Airbus jets that are presently gathering climate-related data for scientific purposes, Lufthansa is also working with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology on a world-first project to convert a Lufthansa Airbus A350-900 into a research aircraft.

Lufthansa performed its longest non-stop flight to date in 2021 when it flew one of its Airbus A350-900s from Hamburg to Mount Pleasant on the Falkland Islands on behalf of the Alfred Wegener Institute. The same year also saw a Lufthansa A350-900 converted into a climate research aircraft for the CARIBIC Project.

Back in 2011 Lufthansa was the first airline to trial biofuel in its daily flight operations. For some six months, a Lufthansa Airbus A321 was operated on the Hamburg-Frankfurt route with one of its two engines powered with a fuel blend consisting 50% of biosynthetic kerosene. In the same year Lufthansa teamed up with the Forschungszentrum Jülich to conduct a new type of long-term climate research study using scheduled air services to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere. As part of this IAGOS research project, specially developed instruments were installed aboard a Lufthansa Airbus A340-300 to collect trace elements from the atmosphere in the course of the aircraft’s regular flight operations.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9757161140441895}",positive,0.9757161140441895,1
Airbus celebrates milestone in Mobile while looking to expand workforce in near future - Fox 10 News,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMDgvYWlyYnVzLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtbWlsZXN0b25lLW1vYmlsZS13aGlsZS1sb29raW5nLWV4cGFuZC13b3JrZm9yY2UtbmVhci1mdXR1cmUv0gGAAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMDgvYWlyYnVzLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtbWlsZXN0b25lLW1vYmlsZS13aGlsZS1sb29raW5nLWV4cGFuZC13b3JrZm9yY2UtbmVhci1mdXR1cmUvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - Airbus and area politicians toasted a milestone Monday, but both have much bigger goals for the airplane manufacturer.

The occasion for Monday’s celebration was the 100th plane from the company’s family of A320 jets built at the Airbus assembly plant at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley to Delta Air Lines.

“Here’s to the future,” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said, raising a champagne flute in a roomful of Airbus employees and dignitaries.

The assembly plant employs 1,600 workers and another 400 work at an engineering center nearby and at a facility at Mobile Regional Airport. The workforce is up several hundred since the beginning of last year, and Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO Jeff Knittel said that number is poised to grow. He told reporters he expects to hire 300 to 400 employees in the coming year and more after that.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see another thousand employees here over time,” he told reporters.

From the podium, Knittel said the company has come a long way from its origins in Mobile with a small engineering center.

“When you look back on where we were five, 10 years ago, I don’t think anyone could’ve imagined what we are doing here. … We’ve gone from 50, 100 employees – this site now has 1,600 employees,” he said. “And we’ll have well over 2,000 very, very soon.”

Not bad for a city that a Boeing executive once derisively suggested could not put together a tricycle on Christmas morning.

The plane’s handover to Delta – which, technically, will not happen for another few days – comes at a time of strong global demand and when Airbus has a clear edge over its longtime rival, Boeing Co.

Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia said Airbus is working toward 75 new planes a month worldwide, while Boeing is at 31 and aiming for about 50. He said expanding to Mobile has benefited both the company and the city.

“In terms of Mobile, it’s worked out really well, giving them a little extra capacity and also helping to kind of circumvent, work around any protectionist impulses by American politicians,” he told FOX10 News.

A second assembly line under construction at Brookley is scheduled to open at 2025, and the company last year launched a joint bid with Lockheed Martin to try again for a contract to build aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force. Airbus and Mobile lost out to Boeing on that contract in 2011, but Knittel said he is optimistic. He noted that the Airbus assembly line in Mobile has produced 300 commercial planes.

“When you look at the tanker, there’s no reason we can’t do a similar thing,” he said.

Aboulafia, managing director of Aerodynamic Advisory, said Airbus is well-entrenched in Mobile with or without a military contract.

“It’s looking pretty good for Mobile, both for the A320s and A220s and, perhaps, beyond that,” he said. “You know, basically, it’s all hands on deck for Airbus. They need all the capacity they can get. It’s even possible they’ll put additional work there, not just final assembly.”

Airbus has struggled to hit delivery targets. Its engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney, has had well-publicized complaints about the durability of its engines and delays in delivering them. Aboulafia called engines the “weakest link” of the supply chain, adding that companies across many industries have struggled to return to normalcy after the COVID-19 pandemic.

While declining to address issues with any particular supplier, Knittel did acknowledged the problem.

“There are supply chain issues,” he said. “We work closely with our partners, who are the suppliers. We have good visibility as to what those specific issues are. … We’ve said it publicly – supply chain has been an obstacle. And we need to work together to solve the problem. And we will.”

As for Delta, it holds the distinction of flying all of the different commercial aircraft that Airbus manufacturers.

Heather Wingate, the company’s senior vice president of government affairs, said the A320 is an important part of the airliner’s future.

“This plane, as I mentioned in my remarks, is incredibly fuel efficient, which is very important to us as we look towards a net zero future,” he said.

Airbus has ambitious goal of delivering 720 planes worldwide by the end of the year and got off to a slow start.

“We know we can do it,” Knittel said. “We have the right employees to do it. That doesn’t mean there’s not obstacles. It doesn’t mean there aren’t challenges, but we believe that we can deliver at least 720 airplanes this year.”

VSR700 tested at sea in full operational configuration - Airbus,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNS12c3I3MDAtdGVzdGVkLWF0LXNlYS1pbi1mdWxsLW9wZXJhdGlvbmFsLWNvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, Airbus Helicopters and the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) tested the unmanned aerial system (UAS) VSR700 for the first time in an operational configuration from a ship at sea. At the beginning of May, the VSR700 performed 80 fully autonomous take-offs and landings from a civil vessel equipped with a helicopter deck, cruising off the coast of Brittany in the west of France.

“This flight test campaign was an important step for the VSR700 programme as it allowed us to validate the excellent performance of the drone in operational conditions, which were representative of its future missions,” said Nicolas Delmas, Head of VSR700 programme at Airbus Helicopters. “The VSR700 prototype opened its flight envelope in winds above 40 knots, accumulated eight hours of testing in 14 flights, and made successful landings in several different sea states,” he added.

In 2022, the autonomous take-off and landing capabilities of the VSR700 were tested from the same vessel using an optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) based on a modified Guimbal Cabri G2 equipped with the autonomous take-off and landing (ATOL) system developed for the VSR700. This time the test campaign took place with the SDAM demonstrator and fully validated the capabilities of the system as part of the SDAM (Système de Drone Aérien pour la Marine) study that was awarded to Airbus Helicopters and Naval Group in 2017.

Autonomous take-off and landing capabilities are a key asset of the VSR700 and are made possible with the use of the Airbus DeckFinder system. This enables autonomous launch and recovery of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) with an accuracy of 10-20cm during challenging operations in harsh environmental conditions, independently of GNSS/GPS and regardless of degraded visual conditions.

This new test campaign follows two series of trials that were conducted with the DGA in late 2022 and early 2023 from the Levant Island test center located in the south of France. During these trials, the SDAM prototype demonstrated its ability to operate in a maritime environment. The handling qualities of the aircraft were tested as well as the capabilities of the sensors (a maritime surveillance radar, an electro optical sensor, and an AIS receiver) alongside the mission system developed by Naval Group.

The next development steps will see the second VSR700 prototype perform its maiden flight ahead of flight testing onboard a French Navy FREMM during the second semester of this year.

Revenues € 11.8 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 0.8 billion

EBIT (reported) € 0.4 billion; EPS (reported) € 0.59

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € -0.9 billion

Guidance unchanged

Amsterdam, 03 May 2023 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for its First Quarter (Q1) ending 31 March 2023.

“The first quarter confirmed strong demand for our products, particularly for commercial aircraft. We delivered 127 commercial aircraft, which is reflected in the Q1 financials. The quarter also benefited from a good performance in Helicopters,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to face an adverse operating environment that includes in particular persistent tensions in the supply chain. Our 2023 guidance is unchanged with commercial aircraft deliveries expected to be backloaded. We remain focused on delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up and longer-term transformation.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 156 (Q1 2022: 253 aircraft), with net orders of 142 aircraft after cancellations (Q1 2022: 83 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,254 commercial aircraft at the end of March 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 39 net orders (Q1 2022: 56 units) which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 2.5 billion (Q1 2022: € 3.2 billion).

Consolidated revenues decreased slightly to € 11.8 billion (Q1 2022: € 12.0 billion). A total of 127 commercial aircraft were delivered (Q1 2022: 142(1) aircraft), comprising 10 A220s, 106 A320 Family, 6 A330sand 5 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased 5 percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the lower deliveries, partly offset by the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters deliveries increased to 71 units (Q1 2022: 39 units), mainly driven by the Light helicopter segment. The Division’s revenues rose 26 percent, mainly reflecting deliveries and a solid performance across programmes, favourable mix effects as well as a good start to the year in services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 percent, mainly driven by lower volume in Military Air Systems and in Space Systems. One A400M transport aircraft was delivered in Q1 2023.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – decreased to € 773 million (Q1 2022: € 1,263 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities decreased to € 580 million (Q1 2022: € 1,065 million). The decrease reflects the lower deliveries, a slightly less favourable hedge rate compared to Q1 2022 and investments for preparing the future. Q1 2022 included the positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia.

The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft by the middle of the decade. On the A320 Family programme, the Company continues to ramp-up towards a monthly production rate of 65 aircraft by the end of 2024. The recently announced decision to add a second Final Assembly Line in Tianjin will increase global industrial capacity to 10 Final Assembly Lines for the A320 Family, supporting Airbus' plans to produce 75 aircraft per month in 2026. The flight test programme of the A321XLR is progressing and entry-into-service is expected to take place in Q2 2024.

As previously announced, the Company targets rate 4 for the A330 in 2024 and rate 9 for the A350 at the end of 2025. On the A350F, the first components were recently produced by Airbus Atlantic in Nantes. As the first milestones are reached, the industrial planning for this variant is being slightly adjusted with the entry-into-service now slipping into 2026.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 156 million (Q1 2022: € 90 million), reflecting the solid performance across programmes, favourable mix effects and the good start in services. Q1 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 36 million (Q1 2022: € 106 million), mainly reflecting the lower volume in Military Air Systems and in Space Systems. Q1 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 683 million (Q1 2022: € 586 million).

Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 390 million (Q1 2022: € 1,429 million), including net Adjustments of € -383 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ -360 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation;

€ -9 million related to the Aerostructures transformation;

€ -14 million of other costs including compliance.

The financial result was € 149 million (Q1 2022: € 166 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments, partly offset by negative impacts from the revaluation of financial instruments and the net interest result. Consolidated net income(2) was € 466 million (Q1 2022: € 1,219 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 0.59 (Q1 2022: € 1.55).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was € -889 million (Q1 2022: € 213 million), mainly reflecting the necessary inventory build-up as the Company executes the production ramp-up. Consolidated free cash flow was € -886 million (Q1 2022: € 161 million). The gross cash position stood at € 22.4 billion at the end of March 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 8.4 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion).

Outlook

The guidance issued in February 2023 remains unchanged.

As the basis for its 2023 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2023 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2023 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 6.0 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.0 billion.

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1.

Philippine Airlines selects A350-1000 for future long haul fleet - Airbus,"Wed, 10 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNS1waGlsaXBwaW5lLWFpcmxpbmVzLXNlbGVjdHMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtbG9uZy1oYXVsLWZsZWV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 10 May 2023 – Philippine Airlines (PAL) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airbus for the purchase of nine A350-1000s. Under the Philippine carrier’s Ultra Long Haul Fleet project, the A350-1000 will be operated on non-stop services from Manila to North America, including to the East Coast of the US and Canada.

The new aircraft will join two A350-900s already in service at the airline and currently flying to destinations in North America, Asia and Australia. As with the A350-900, the PAL A350-1000s will be configured in a premium layout with separate Business Class, Premium Economy and Economy Class cabins.

Captain Stanley K. Ng, President and Chief Operating Officer of Philippine Airlines, said that the range of the A350-1000 would enable the airline to fly non-stop transpacific and transpolar routes in both directions all year. These will include some of the longest commercial flights in the world, such as those linking the Philippines with New York and Toronto. With an expanded A350 fleet, PAL will have the ability to once again provide a direct link from the Philippines to Europe.

“The A350-1000 combines greater range capability with the higher capacity we need to serve future demand. It’s the perfect aircraft to enable PAL to meet its expansion plans in a sustainable way, while offering passengers the highest levels of onboard comfort. We are committed to offering our passengers the best possible travel experience, and these state-of-the-art aircraft will enable us to do just that as we carry out our mission to connect the world, and grow trade and tourism.”

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, said: “Flying passengers farther and in greater comfort, the A350 brings a step-change in fuel efficiency and an immediate significant contribution to reduced emissions. These are the attributes that have made the A350 the choice of leading airlines worldwide. We look forward to working closely with our long-standing customer Philippine Airlines as it moves forward with its long haul fleet modernisation programme.”

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft and has set new standards for intercontinental travel. It offers the longest range capability of any commercial airliner in production today and is capable of flying 8,700 nautical miles or 16,100 kilometres non-stop.

At the end of April 2023, the A350 Family had won 928 firm orders from 54 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful wide-body aircraft ever. Some 530 aircraft are currently in the fleets of 40 airlines, flying primarily on long haul routes.

Philippine Airlines operates various Airbus types on its full service network. In addition to the A350 on long-haul intercontinental routes, PAL flies A330-300s on services to the Middle East, Australia and various points in Asia. The Philippine flag carrier also operates a fleet of A320 and A321 single aisle aircraft on its extensive domestic and regional network out of hubs in Manila and Cebu.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9934374690055847}",neutral,0.9934374690055847,0

This is the eighth helicopter delivered under the 36-unit contract signed at the end of 2021 to supply the Armed Forces and State Security Forces.

This delivery is six months ahead of schedule, which will facilitate crew training and the entry into service of the H135 for the 78th Wing at the MIlitary School of Helicopters in Armilla (Granada), where it will perform advanced training tasks for military pilots. Once the planned fleet of 11 helicopters are delivered to the Air Force, the H135 will become the helicopter of reference for pilot training for the Spanish Air Force, Army, Navy, the Guardia Civil and other countries requesting such training at the Granada base.

""We are very proud to know that all young pilots from the Ministry of Defence corps will now be trained on the H135, the world's benchmark for military training missions. It is a versatile, reliable and efficient helicopter, ideal for the transition to more complex aircraft, with more than 400,000 flight hours of military training for 12 military customers. We are confident that the H135 will represent a leap in the quality of teaching and will reinforce the Military Helicopter School as the benchmark it is, throughout the world"" said Fernando Lombo, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters Spain.

The H135 is already in service with the Spanish Army’s training unit (ACAVIET) and the Emergency Battalion (BHELEME II). In the coming months, the Navy will also receive the first of the seven H135 units foreseen in the contract. The H135 is the most popular helicopter in the Spanish fleet, thanks to its operational versatility, flying missions as diverse and demanding as military training, police surveillance and intervention, mountain rescue missions and emergency medical transport, for which it is the benchmark in Europe.

The light twin-engine Airbus H135 is equipped with the most advanced technologies available, including Airbus Helicopters' Helionix avionics suite. Some 1,400 H135 helicopters are operated by more than 300 operators in 65 countries. The fleet has accumulated more than 6.5 million flight hours.

The increased capacity improves the passenger experience and reduces cabin crew workload, in particular during boarding and deplaning.

The bins have been developed to perfectly match the Airspace cabin design language, so airlines with mixed A320 Family fleets or operating Airbus widebodies with Airspace cabins can offer connecting passengers a more seamless transition from one flight to another.

Optimised for plug & play replacement of the in-service enhanced bins, the new L Bins can be retrofitted in 3 to 5 days, making them the fastest and most cost effective A320 Family retrofit solution. They also share common parts with Airspace XL Bins for lower spares holding costs in mixed fleets.

The bins, which are made of ultra-lightweight and highly stable composite products, will be manufactured by EFW (Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH), an Airbus First Tier supplier for composite components since 1993. Production will take place in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site employing measures such as photovoltaics and bioenergy.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",positive,0.9999983310699463,1

From now on, their medical personnel will use them to save lives: In the containers, they can safely transport the sick, injured and wounded to hospitals or field hospitals - and even provide medical care while doing so.



""Our protected-wounded transport containers improve the Bundeswehr's rescue chain and ability to recover, transport and treat the wounded in crisis areas,"" said Harald Mannheim, managing director of Airbus Defence and Space GmbH. ""In this respect, the GVTC is further proof of how we and our state-of-the-art technologies help all those who help others.""



The first GVTC, delivered on 20 April, will be used as a so-called ‘proof-of-concept’ vehicle. This means that the Bundeswehr will put the container through its paces and train and educate its medical personnel on it, after which, the GVTC will go into series production. The 12-series GVTCs are then scheduled to be handed over to the Bundeswehr from 2024 to 2026.

The protected-wounded transport container is based on the international ISO standard 20-foot container.



The GVTC: flexible, simple and safe



The GVTC, which Airbus Defence and Space developed with partner companies Drehtainer GmbH and Binz Automotive, is based on the international ISO standard 20-foot container. It is around 6 metres long and can be easily mounted on existing Bundeswehr trucks via an integrated hook roll-off system. Cranes or other special equipment are not required.



In the GVTC, two paramedics can treat up to eight patients and, for example, monitor their vital signs and oxygen saturation, perform a defibrillator operation or have patients ventilated via the integrated oxygen-generation system.

ABU DHABI, UAE, May 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC – Masdar, one of the world's leading clean energy companies, has signed an agreement with Airbus, the largest aeronautics and space company in Europe and a worldwide leader to support the development and growth of the global sustainable aviation fuel market.

Mikail Houari, President, Airbus Africa and Middle East; Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus; HE Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber; Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology, Chairman of Masdar and COP28 President-Designate; Abdelqader El Ramahi, Chief Green Hydrogen Officer, Masdar

The signing ceremony was held in the presence of His Excellency Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Chairman of Masdar and COP28 President-Designate, Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus, and Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer, Masdar. The agreement was signed by Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi, Chief Green Hydrogen Officer, Masdar and Mikail Houari, President, Airbus Africa and Middle East.

The agreement highlights areas of collaboration between the two companies, including Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Green Hydrogen, Direct Air Capture technologies, as well as supporting the development and implementation of 'book and claim' solutions.

Direct Air Capture technologies enable the capturing of atmospheric CO2 which could, in combination with Hydrogen be used to produce synthetic SAF. The use of SAF based on Green Hydrogen and Direct Air Capture is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 percent when compared to conventional jet fuel with the global sustainable aviation fuel market expected to grow to over US$14bn by 2032, according to Precedence Research.

Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer, Masdar, said: ""This MoU with Airbus further amplifies Masdar's commitment to accelerating the reduction of global carbon emissions and pioneering worldwide efforts towards decarbonization. We look forward to working closely with Airbus to support the development of the global sustainable aviation fuel market and to exploring the adoption of creative low carbon solutions in support of net zero.""

Mikail Houari, President, Airbus Africa and Middle East, said: ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the best solutions for reducing the aviation sector's carbon footprint and this agreement will support in advancing its much-needed development and growth. At Airbus, we continue to lead the industry towards a more sustainable future. We are committed to contributing to driving innovation to support the ambition set by IATA, ATAG and ICAO to reach ""net zero carbon emissions by 2050.""

""We have a legacy of successful collaborations in the UAE that has contributed to advancing the country's aerospace sector capabilities. This new agreement with Masdar marks yet another milestone in the partnership between Airbus and the UAE,"" he added.

Sustainable aviation fuel is an immediately available solution for significantly reducing the CO2 emissions of global air transportation. It can be used as a drop-in fuel without modifying existing storage and refueling infrastructure, aircraft, or engines. The gradual incorporation of the fuel worldwide is estimated to significantly help lower the CO2 emissions of air transportation and is key to a net-zero future for the global aviation industry.

Earlier this year, during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, Masdar also announced that the Masdar-led initiative focusing on green hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is actively working with licensors to certify a new production pathway for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from methanol.

Established in 2006, Masdar is the UAE's clean energy powerhouse, active in over 40 countries across the globe, and has invested in a portfolio of renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of around 20 gigawatts (GW).

Airbus’s Future Planes Will Have See-Through Ceilings So You Can Gaze at the Stars While You Fly - Robb Report,"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1jYWJpbi1jb25jZXB0LWZ1dHVyZS0xMjM0ODQ5NDU5L9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1jYWJpbi1jb25jZXB0LWZ1dHVyZS0xMjM0ODQ5NDU5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus just gave jet-setters a glimpse at the future of the in-flight experience.

The aerospace giant presented its next-gen aircraft cabin during a virtual media briefing. Developed in partnership with 10 airlines and eight technology firms, Airspace is at the bleeding edge of aeronautical design and will shape how the company creates jet interiors from 2035 onwards.

The company says the concept is built on three pillars: transparency, decarbonization, and circularity. That’s a fancy way of saying the cabin is eco-friendly and will help offset each plane’s carbon footprint. Of course, Airbus says fliers can expect more personalized service, better seats, additional smart devices, and an “enhanced atmosphere.” The enhancements, it appears, will include a see-through ceiling that allows passengers to gaze up at the clouds or stars while flying—or soak in some natural light.

Airspace cabins will help to offset the plane’s carbon emissions. Airbus

In terms of transparency, passengers will be able to easily view the environmental impact of each flight via a mobile travel companion app, which will also offer options for ways to offset carbon emissions.

Speaking of decarbonization, Airbus claims the easiest way to cut emissions is to reduce the plane’s weight. To that end, the new cabins will feature a “bionic design” that will reportedly lower a plane’s weight by 40 percent. Part of this reduction comes from new catering and trolley concepts that would reduce the galley weight. Pre-ordering food on long-range flights could lower waste and weight by 15 percent, for instance.

Passengers will be able to see the environmental impact of each flight. Airbus

As for circularity, Airbus says it will rethink its cabin materials, opting for versions it can recycle, repair, and reuse.

So, when will Airspace take flight? Airbus will begin making changes to its existing cabin range this year, but will fully introduce the concept with its next generation of aircraft. The company says it will provide more information about the new cabins at the 2023 Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany next week. Stay tuned.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9929558038711548}",neutral,0.9929558038711548,0

Airbus tees up new surveillance drone with 'Made in Spain' tack - C4ISRNET,"Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS91bm1hbm5lZC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2FpcmJ1cy10ZWVzLXVwLW5ldy1zdXJ2ZWlsbGFuY2UtZHJvbmUtd2l0aC1tYWRlLWluLXNwYWluLXRhY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID — Airbus Spain is ready to start work on the high-endurance drone SiRTAP for the Spanish and Colombian air forces, saying the first units could be delivered to Spain by 2026 if the government approves a contract soon.

Launched in 2015, following an initial request from Spain and later on joined by Colombia, Airbus has been leading the SirTAP (Sistema RPAS Táctico de Altas Prestaciones) program – previously known as the Atlante 2 MALE drone– aimed at creating a tactical unmanned aerial vehicle suited for intelligence gathering and surveillance. The platforms are set to replace both countries’ aging Israeli-made drone fleets, Spain’s Searcher MkIIs manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries’ (IAI) and Colombia’s Hermes 450, produced by Elbit.

Speaking to Defense News at the Feria Internacional de Defensa y Seguridad (FEINDEF) exhibition here, Jean-Brice Dumont, head of military air systems at Airbus, said that Spain is considering procuring a total of 27 SiRTAPs, each of which consists of three aircraft, a ground control station and data reception equipment. The drone is currently still in a pre-design phase.

“Our objective would be to have the first batch of these delivered by 2026 … which means we have to hit the ground running to make this happen,” Dumont said. No contract has yet been signed, however.

Both nations signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for cooperation on the drone in 2019, followed by a formal proposal submitted by Airbus to the Spanish Ministry of Industry in January 2021. More recently, the Spanish MoD obtained approval to invest approximately USD $542 million (€500 million) from its defense budget into the drone project.

As for Colombia, the country is reportedly looking to buy six systems, including 18 drones, with some Colombian suppliers contributing elements to the design of the systems.

Airbus officials have previously stressed the program’s premise of producing 90% of drone components in Spain. However, Dumont points out that in order to meet the goals of fast-tracking the program, a compromise may have to be reached in possibly opting for non-Spanish suppliers in some cases.

The SiRTAP is envisioned to have over 20 hours of endurance, flying at altitudes of 21,000 feet while carrying up to 150 kilograms of payload. A collapsible design means forces can eventually transport it overland and by air in transport aircraft such as the C-295, which can carry two drones. It is suited for various mission sets including intelligence gathering, maritime surveillance, convoy escort and force protection as well as electronic warfare, according to Airbus.

Dumont notes that the platform was primarily designed as a cost-effective solution to appeal in part to air forces with lower budgets but wishing to acquire advanced capabilities and certifications. Although the SiRTAP is currently a Spanish-Colombian story, other countries are said to have shown interest in the drone and are closely monitoring its development, including France, he said.

"Airbus Identifies Heat, Humidity As Causes Of A380 Wing-Spar Cracking - Aviation Week","Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L3NhZmV0eS1vcHMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtaWRlbnRpZmllcy1oZWF0LWh1bWlkaXR5LWNhdXNlcy1hMzgwLXdpbmctc3Bhci1jcmFja2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANKFURT—A phenomenon called hydrogen assisted cracking or hydrogen embrittlement has been identified as the cause of accelerated crack development in certain wing spars of Airbus A380s that have been stored for extended periods of time.

“The biggest driver is temperature; the second is moisture,” Pierre-Henri Brousse, head of the A380 program, told Aviation Week. When aircraft are on the ground and exposed to extreme weather conditions, hydrogen is diffused into the materials and causes embrittlement of the aluminum alloy, which in turn makes the generation of cracks easier.

Inspections to include “factored time on ground”

Storage recommendations will not change for A380 and other aircraft types

MRO capacity shortage makes repair work challenging

The findings are behind a May 11 airworthiness directive (AD) issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) that introduced the concept of “factored time on ground” (FTOG) and required inspections and potentially repairs at intervals also linked to actual aircraft age and a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) threshold of 510 tons.

The affected areas are the top and bottom flanges of the outer rear spar (ORS) between ribs 33 and 49. Previous ADs also included instructions for other parts in which defects had been found—the outer inner front spar (OIFS) between ribs 8 and 14 and the outer front spar between ribs 38 and 49.

EASA and Airbus had determined as early as 2019 that aircraft have to be inspected 15 years after the date of the wingbox assembly.

Following the findings, the maintenance limit was pulled forward twice. EASA published an AD on Aug. 31, 2022, expanding on a 2019 directive. In the AD, EASA said: “Occurrences have been reported of finding cracks in the affected areas of the wing ORS on in-service A380 aeroplanes. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could reduce the structural integrity of the wing.” The 2019 AD, based on Airbus’ service bulletin A380-57-8263, had initially set the 15-year limit. However, “since that AD was issued, it has been determined that additional areas may be affected by the same unsafe condition, and that all MSN (manufacturer serial numbers) must be inspected.” EASA added in December 2022 that “recent inspection results have indicated the need for ORS inspection from 15 years to 12.5 years.” That was later revised to 11.5 years—with the initial date of wing box assembly as the reference point.

But that remained insufficient. “We inspected some aircraft that were younger than the threshold described by the regulator,” Brousse said. “And we had some findings.”

Airbus then launched a deep dive into the data to try to understand why aircraft as young as 10 years (after wing box assembly and therefore with sometimes significantly fewer years in revenue service) were developing the cracks. “We accumulated a sample that became statistically relevant,” Brousse said. Eventually, the research yielded results—namely that storage conditions have an effect on how fast the cracking develops.

Importantly, the findings will not “substantially change” Airbus’ recommendations for storage of the A380 or any other type. The aluminum alloy of the affected spars is no longer used in any other Airbus aircraft and is changed to a different material when parts are replaced during repairs. “We have no concerns for other components,” Brousse said.

Airbus has not disclosed which airlines are most affected by the defects. However, Emirates said in November 2022 that it is dealing with the issue. The airline had parked many of its A380s at the Dubai World Central airport during the coronavirus pandemic, where they were exposed to particularly high temperatures and humidity during summer. Qatar Airways and Etihad are two more Gulf carriers with A380 fleets, though Etihad is only now beginning to return its A380s to service.

According to Aviation Week Network’s Fleet Discovery database, 135 A380s are in active service, with Emirates operating 87 of them. Singapore Airlines and British Airways are flying 11 of the aircraft each. Qatar Airways and Qantas are following with seven and six, respectively. Most current A380 operators are in the process of returning more of the aircraft from storage, given how fast demand has rebounded on long-haul routes.

Emirates has two more aircraft in parked/reserve status, six are parked and 26 are stored.

According to Airbus, wing inspections take about one week. The non-destructive test inspections can typically be performed by airlines in-house. Affected parts can be repaired through local stopholes or reinforcements, or will be replaced. Stopholes can be introduced in one shift, while the more extensive repairs can take one week per area affected.

Finding enough MRO capacity to deal with the repairs is an ongoing issue, Brousse said. However, he described the situation as manageable and now that A380s are being taken out of service because of the cracking, Airbus is trying to find more MRO providers globally that have the needed A380 capability and free capacity. The manufacturer is also helping with repairs of some aircraft that are performed in Airbus hangars in Toulouse.

Emirates has returned younger aircraft first to avoid running into inspection intervals early. An Emirates spokesperson said the airline is reviewing the inspection requirements outlined in the May 11 EASA AD. “Currently, we see minimal disruption to our scheduled A380 operations,” the spokesperson told Aviation Week. “We are working on the mid-longer term MRO support requirements for our A380 fleet. We expect a large part of the work will be conducted at Emirates’ Engineering Center, and we are also looking at supplementary support from Airbus and our MRO partners.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998692274093628}",neutral,0.9998692274093628,0
China's C919 first flight rattles Boeing-Airbus duopoly - Fortune,"Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9jaGluYS1haXJwbGFuZS1qZXQtYzkxOS1jb21hYy1maXJzdC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWZsaWdodC1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pomp and circumstance greeted the arrival of China Eastern Airlines flight MU9191 in Beijing’s Capital Airport on Sunday. Chinese state broadcasters streamed the entire flight, which departed from Shanghai. Two fire engines greeting the arriving jet with a water salute. Passengers on the flight itself got a special menu: claypot rice, mango pudding, and White Rabbit candy—a Shanghai specialty.

The celebration marked the first commercial flight of the C919, a single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft designed by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). Both COMAC and China hope the new plane can compete with Boeing’s 737 Max and Airbus’s A320, helping break the decades-long duopoly held by the two commercial aviation giants.

The C919’s first flight has been a long time coming for COMAC. The company first announced the plane in 2007, but production delays pushed the first test flight to 2017. Chinese regulators only approved the plane for commercial passenger operations last September. COMAC delivered the first plane to China Eastern in December 2022.

China Eastern now expects to put the C919 into regular commercial service, including a route between Shanghai and Chengdu, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province.

C919 fits into Beijing strategy of self-sufficiency

Beijing hopes the C919 proves that its strategy to build up domestic firms in high-end manufacturing and technology—not just in aerospace but also sectors like semiconductors, renewable energy, and electric vehicles—is paying off.

Worsening U.S.-China tensions, as well as U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China, have made Beijing’s effort of self-sufficiency more urgent. COMAC’s new plane will help the country withstand the U.S.’s “high-tech containment strategy,” argued an editorial from state-run outlet Global Times earlier this year.

Yet production of the C919 will be slow. While COMAC says it has received over 1,200 orders for the new jet, it only expects to be able to produce 150 planes domestically a year by 2028. By comparison, Airbus and Boeing delivered 661 and 480 planes respectively last year.

Earlier efforts to break up Boeing-Airbus duopoly

Several other companies have tried, and failed, to challenge Boeing and Airbus’s dominance. In 2018, Canada-based Bombardier ceded control of the CSeries, its most recent commercial plane, to Airbus. Then, in February of this year, Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi abandoned its 15-year plan to create a regional jet.

Yet Chinese government support could give the C919 a potential advantage, as Chinese airlines—several of which are state-run—order the plane to support COMAC. Those orders might hurt Boeing and Airbus, both of which have sold hundreds of planes to Chinese airlines.

Boeing’s struggles in China

Boeing, in particular, has not yet rebounded from its 737 Max debacle in China. Beijing grounded the plane in March 2019 after the Boeing model was involved in two high-profile accidents, and only re-approved the plane for flight in December 2021. Even then, the 737 Max did not return to China’s skies until January. Chinese carriers have started to shift their allegiance to Airbus over Boeing.

In 2021, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury predicted that COMAC might be able to capture market share from Boeing and Airbus when it comes to single-aisle planes (like Airbus’s A320), creating a “triopoly” by the end of the decade.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9761216640472412}",neutral,0.9761216640472412,0

"EarthCARE, when a satellite sheds light on the clouds - Airbus","Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LWVhcnRoY2FyZS13aGVuLWEtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXNoZWRzLWxpZ2h0LW9uLXRoZS1jbG91ZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EarthCARE is an important new satellite designed and built by Airbus to help scientists better understand climate change on clouds, aerosols and radiation. Under construction for the European Space Agency (ESA), Airbus successfully completed the Electro-Magnetic Compatibility tests in April 2023 and now this latest ESA “Earth Explorer” satellite is getting closer to launch in May 2024.

The impact of climate change is visible everyday on our planet. One of the starkest changes we are experiencing is increasing temperatures.

Although temperature increases can be analysed on the ground, satellite information provides a valuable, complementary source of data that helps refine prediction models. A better understanding of how the different elements that impact our climate interact together is vital. The study of clouds and aerosols - tiny atmospheric particles - is one of them, since clouds are a key regulator of the Earth’s average temperature.

This is where the scientific EarthCARE mission, a joint venture between Europe (ESA) and Japan (the JAXA Japanese space agency), comes in, to quantify the role that clouds and aerosols play in heating and cooling Earth’s atmosphere.

A breakthrough in studying climate change from space

EarthCARE, standing for Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer, is backed by more than 200 research institutes around the world. Scientists will be able to use the data to create accurate models of cloud development, their behaviour, composition, and interaction with aerosols.

Clouds influence the Earth's energy balance (the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing energy from the Earth), climate and weather.

Some clouds reflect solar energy back to space, contributing to cooling. Others act as a radiative “blanket”, locking in some of the energy emitted from the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere and contributing to warming.

In addition, aerosols influence the lifecycle of clouds as they absorb and retain water or become the core of cloud droplets. They contribute indirectly to radiative forcing, quantifying the change in the Earth’s energy budget.

“Predicting temperature variations is really difficult as the models contain a lot of uncertainties and different parameters to take into account,” says Maximilian Sauer, EarthCARE project Leader at Airbus Defence and Space. Cloud systems are complex and because they change and move rapidly, their structure is hard to simulate. “For the first time, EarthCARE will enable us to collect simultaneous observations of cloud and aerosol profiles, together with solar and thermal radiation to enhance climate models.”

EarthCARE will circle Earth in a Sun-synchronous polar orbit crossing the equator in the early afternoon to optimise daylight conditions.The mission will measure the vertical structure and horizontal distribution of cloud and aerosol fields, together with the levels of outgoing radiation.

The computermodels being developed will allow more accurate representations of the heating or cooling process happening on our planet. The data will also help scientists to learn more on the interrelationships between clouds and rainfall, their effects on radiation and the balance between clouds’ cooling and warming influences.

Final tests complete on EarthCARE

The EarthCARE satellite, the largest and most complex Earth Explorer to date, will carry four scientific instruments: a lidar and a radar to measure the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols, an imager to collect cloud and aerosol information across the satellite ground track and a broadband radiometer for measuring outgoing reflected solar and emitted thermal energy at the top of the atmosphere.

After finalising integration in June 2022, EarthCARE was transported from the Airbus site in Friedrichshafen, Germany, to the European Space Agency's ESTEC technology centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. There, it was thoroughly tested to make sure it could survive the stresses and strains that occur during launch and the environmental conditions that await it in orbit. In April 2023, it completed its electromagnetic compatibility test to ensure that the electrical and electronic equipment onboard function correctly without disturbing the scientific instruments. With that last month's major milestone achieved, the satellite is now ready for space.

With the new EarthCARE mission, Airbus continues to support scientists to better understand our climate by providing valuable data that will improve current models for climate prediction. Following the Aeolus mission, Airbus keeps pioneering cutting-edge technologies with ATLID, the atmospheric lidar instrument, making the company a worldwide specialist in spaceborne lidar to protect the planet.

Storage May Exacerbate Airbus A380 Wing-Spar Crack Issue - Aviation Week,"Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L3NhZmV0eS1vcHMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi9zdG9yYWdlLW1heS1leGFjZXJiYXRlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXdpbmctc3Bhci1jcmFjay1pc3N1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380s that sit idle in severe environmental conditions may be susceptible to wing-spar cracking previously linked to the wing’s age, prompting the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to adopt broader inspection criteria recommended by the manufacturer.

A May 11 airworthiness directive (AD) requires A380 operators to calculate “factored time on ground” (FTOG) and conduct inspections based on Airbus’ revised criteria. The AD is based on a May 11 Airbus operators’ telex.

The AD builds on existing inspection criteria for the A380 wing box areas: the top and bottom flanges of the outer rear spar (ORS) between Ribs 33 and 49, the outer inner front spar (OIFS) between Ribs 8 and 14 and the outer front spar (OFS) between Ribs 38 and 49. The original AD was issued in 2019, covering only part of the affected area and setting inspection thresholds starting 15 years after the wing box assembly date. Feedback from operators and additional work by Airbus prompted subsequent ADs that expanded the areas that needed checks and shortened the inspection thresholds. The most recent AD, issued in 2022, mandated starting ORS inspections 11.5 years after the wing box assembly date.

The new criteria affect only the ORS area.

“Since that [2022] AD was issued, prompted by analysis of further inspection results, it was determined that the threshold for ORS inspection must depend on more criteria than only the wing age,” EASA said. “The severity of ORS findings showed a relationship with the amount of time an airplane spends on ground (e.g., parked, stored) in severe environmental conditions. This new criterion introduces the need to calculate FTOG as defined [in the Airbus telex].”

Among the new triggers for ORS inspections is an aircraft returning to service after 12 or more months in service. The most recent, previously mandated checks are still in place.

Wing inspections take about one week. The non-destructive checks are typically performed by airlines in-house.

Aviation Week Network’s Fleet Discovery shows 140 A380s in regular service. Another 75 are listed as parked or stored. Emirates Airline has 121 of them, including 88 in service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999899864196777}",neutral,0.9999899864196777,0
"Mobile City Council, County Commission poised to give Airbus $20 million - Fox 10 News","Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvbW9iaWxlLWNpdHktY291bmNpbC1jb3VudHktY29tbWlzc2lvbi1wb2lzZWQtZ2l2ZS1haXJidXMtMjAtbWlsbGlvbi_SAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxMHR2LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L21vYmlsZS1jaXR5LWNvdW5jaWwtY291bnR5LWNvbW1pc3Npb24tcG9pc2VkLWdpdmUtYWlyYnVzLTIwLW1pbGxpb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - City and county leaders will vote next week to give Airbus a combined $20 million to support an expansion of airplane manufacturing in the city.

The city and county each would contribute $10 million over a decade. Of the city’s portion, $2.5 million would fund worker apprenticeship and training initiatives. The rest would help pay for employee retention efforts and offset part of the costs associated with a third assembly line under construction at the company’s plant at Mobile Aeroplex and Brookley.

That assembly line will double the company’s manufacturing capacity for the popular A320 model. The bulk of the company’s 2,000 workers at three locations in Mobile work at the manufacturing plant. The company expects to add 1,000 additional jobs at an average hourly wage of at least $31.25.

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said the city’s $10 million is modest compared to overall $700 million investment that he maintains will do more than just create jobs.

“Airbus has become a significant – not just an employer – but from an image of the city,” he said. “You know, in the aviation, aeronautics world, I mean, everybody pretty much that pays attention in that world knows about Mobile, Alabama, and the great things that are going on.”

Under terms of the proposed agreement, the city would contribute $5 million followed by nine annual installments of $555,556 over a decade. The company would have to refund money if it fails to hit job targets.

The County Commission will discuss a similar arrangement at an agenda-setting meeting Thursday, with a vote expected on Monday.

“We remain grateful for our strong partnerships with state and local leaders as we continue to expand the footprint of Airbus’ U.S. Manufacturing Facility and add another 1,000 jobs,” Airbus Americas spokeswoman Techie Hinkebein said in an email to FOX10 News.

The proposal appears to have widespread support on the City Council.

“There’s a partnership there where with growth of this size that helps to provide opportunity our city,” District 2 Councilman William Carroll told FOX10 News.

Carroll said he expects the growth of Airbus to pay long-term dividends.

“We complain about brain drain,” he said. “You know, let’s do the things that provide the jobs keep people here.”

But District 1 Councilman Cory Penn told FOX10 News that he wants to learn more whether the city will get an appropriate return on a $10 million taxpayer expenditure.

“We’re gonna ask, of course, those questions and figure out you know, in what ways that it can benefit our residents and our city,” he said.

Mobile County Commission President Connie Hudson said she supports the incentives.

“This is a huge expansion for them,” she told FOX10 News. “Another thousand jobs is what they’re talking about.”

But Commissioner Randall Dueitt said he has some reservations.

“I still have a lot of issues with Airbus, and that’s incentivizing companies that don’t hire people who live in Mobile County,” he said.

Dueitt, who represents the southern part of the county, said too many Airbus workers live in Baldwin County, which he said reaps the benefits of Mobile County subsidies. In the past, he said, Aibus has pledged to make “good-faith efforts” to ensure Mobile County residents fill open positions.

“I think we have to ask them to do more than make a good-faith effort,” he said.

Aircraft developer Airbus and France’s military procurement office, Direction Générale de l’Armement, or DGA, jointly conducted the test this month, Airbus said in a May 15 press release.

RELATED

The VSR700 UAS serves as a demonstrator for the French Navy’s “SDAM” future maritime drone program, the acronym standing for the French “Système de Drone Aérien pour la Marine.” Once operational, the SDAMs are expected to be deployed aboard France’s FREMM multi-mission frigates.

One key capability for the new system is vertical takeoff and landing, as well as autonomous takeoff and landing. Airbus said Monday that the aircraft performed 80 fully autonomous takeoffs and landings from a civil vessel outfitted with a helicopter deck, off France’s West Coast of Brittany.

Frigate Fog Landing Deckfinder 2 VSR700 (Airbus)

The VSR700 prototype opened its flight envelope in winds above 40 knots, accumulated eight hours of testing in 14 flights, and made successful landings in several different sea states, said Nicolas Delmas, head of the VSR700 program at Airbus Helicopters in a press release.

The SDAM program aims to develop an vertical-takeoff-and-landing UAS capable of flying for eight hours, carry multiple payloads, and reach speeds of 185 kilometers/hour (115 mph). The company’s DeckFinder system is what enables autonomous launch and recovery of unmanned aerial systems, with Airbus claiming an accuracy of 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) during challenging operations in harsh environmental conditions, independently of GNSS/GPS and regardless of degraded visual conditions.

Prior to the May flight test campaign, Airbus and the DGA in 2022 tested the autonomous takeoff and landing capabilities aboard an optionally piloted vehicle, based on a modified Guimbal Cabri G2, but this latest test was the first time the VSR700 demonstrator was used, the company said. The VSR700 made its maiden flight in 2019.

Airbus and Naval Group were jointly awarded the SDAM risk reduction contract in 2017. Naval Group is developing the mission system for the UAS. The light military tactical vehicle is meant to be deployable aboard both frigates and destroyers, in support of intelligence, surveillance, targeting, and reconnaissance missions, along with anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, search-and-rescue and maritime security.

According to the proposed 2024-2030 military programming law currently being debated by France’s Congress, the Ministry of Defense wants three SDAM aircraft delivered by the end of 2023, eight by the end of 2030, and at least 15 delivered by around 2035.

The DGA procured a second VSR700 demonstrator in 2022. Airbus expects this second aircraft to perform its maiden flight during the second half of 2023, ahead of flight testing aboard a FREMM ship.

Latest generation A220 begins demo tour of Southeast Asia - Airbus,"Tue, 23 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNS1sYXRlc3QtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1hMjIwLWJlZ2lucy1kZW1vLXRvdXItb2Ytc291dGhlYXN0LWFzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Langkawi, 23 May 2023 – Airbus has begun a demonstration tour of Southeast Asia with its latest generation A220. The aircraft arrived today at the Langkawi International Airshow (LIMA 2023) taking place in Malaysia, where it will be on static display for the first day of the show and will also undertake a demonstration flight for industry guests and members of the media.

The A220 is the most modern airliner in its size category, carrying between 100 to 160 passengers on flights of up to 3,450 nautical miles (6,400km). This would enable direct non-stop services between any two points in Malaysia and regional services to destinations afield such as Darwin and Perth in Australia, the Middle East, Tokyo and Seoul.

The A220 brings a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions when compared with previous-generation aircraft of a similar size. This makes an immediate contribution to industry goals to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with 100% SAF by 2030.

The aircraft which will be on display at LIMA 2023 is leased by Airbus from airBaltic. It features a comfortable layout with 148 seats in a single-class passenger cabin. Prior to flying to Langkawi the aircraft made a stop in Kuching in Sarawak, where it was refuelled with a 10% blend of SAF, supplied by Neste.

Following the stop in Langkawi, the aircraft will continue on its tour to visit Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok and Koh Samui.

The A220 is available in two versions, with the -100 variant seating between 100 and 130 passengers and the larger -300 variant seating between 130 and 160 in typical layouts. It has the largest cabin, seats and windows in its class, offering passengers superior comfort. The aircraft is powered by the latest generation Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines.

To date, Airbus has received 785 orders for the A220 and delivered more than 260 aircraft for this Programme.

The tactical aircraft took off from Seville, Spain, on the 5 May at 11.45 local time (GMT+1) and landed at 14.45 after 3 hours of flight.



“This first flight represents a significant accomplishment for the first Make in India aerospace programme. With the Indian Air Force set to become the largest operator of the C295 in the world, this programme exemplifies our commitment to improve the Indian Air Force (IAF) operational capabilities,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.



India acquired 56 C295 aircraft in September 2021 to replace the (IAF) legacy AVRO fleet. The first 16 aircraft will be assembled in Seville, Spain, and delivered to the customer in ‘fly-away’ condition. The following 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by the Tata Advanced Systems (TASL) in India as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies.



This programme will significantly contribute to developing the country’s military industrial ecosystem from the manufacturing to assembly, testing, to delivery and maintenance of the complete lifecycle of the aircraft.



The C295 programme comprises a total of 281 orders from 39 operators, making it an unmatched aircraft in its weight and mission class.

Airbus Designs a Space Station With Artificial Gravity - Universe Today,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE2MTExMi9haXJidXMtZGVzaWducy1hLXNwYWNlLXN0YXRpb24td2l0aC1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWdyYXZpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The International Space Station (ISS) is nearing the end of its service. While NASA and its partners have committed to keeping it in operation until 2030, plans are already in place for successor space stations that will carry on the ISS’ legacy. China plans to assume a leading role with Tiangong, while the India Space Research Organization (ISRO) plans to deploy its own space station by mid-decade. NASA has also contracted with three aerospace companies to design commercial space stations, including Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef, the Axiom Space Station (AxS), and Starlab.

Well, buckle up! The European multinational aerospace giant Airbus has thrown its hat into the ring! In a recently-released video, the company detailed its proposal for a Multi-Purpose Orbital Module (MPOP) called the Airbus LOOP. This modular space segment contains three decks, a centrifuge, and enough volume for a crew of four, making it suitable for future space stations and long-duration missions to Mars. The LOOP builds on the company’s long history of human spaceflight programs, like the ISS Columbus Module , the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), and the Orion European Service Module (ESM).

As you can see from the video below, the interior design consists of three levels (or decks). These include (from top to bottom) a Habitation Deck, a Science Deck, and a Centrifuge that simulates gravity for two crewmembers at a time. The module measures eight meters (about 26 feet) in diameter and roughly the same length, providing close to 100 cubic meters (~3500 ft3) of volume. According to Airbus, separating the interior into different decks allows for an “internal safe harbor concept,” meaning that the crew can move to the deck that affords the most protection in the event of a solar flare or other hazards.

Each deck is accessible via a central “Tunnel” surrounded by a greenhouse structure that can accommodate plant experiments and provide a steady supply of supplemental greens, legumes, and other plants (similar to greenhouses aboard the ISS). The module is designed for a crew of four but can reportedly accommodate up to eight astronauts at a time (temporarily). The deck selection can be adapted to individual mission requirements and objectives, or the mechanical structure can be used alone (a “dry module”).

Individual decks can be equipped with mission-specific machinery and infrastructure depending on the mission requirements. In the standard design, the Habitation Deck is essentially a “common area” with large windows and exercise equipment (stationary bikes). The Science Deck is equipped with multiple computer terminals, an airlock that allows the crew to conduct extra-vehicular activities (EVAs), and smaller portholes to provide views of space. But what is perhaps the most interesting element of the LOOP is the Centrifuge, which consists of two weights and two crew pods.

These pods contain exercise bikes and can accommodate a single crewperson, allowing the crew to work out (two at a time) in a simulated gravity environment. This three-deck design meets all of the basic needs of long-duration stays in space and (according to Airbus) makes the LOOP compatible with all crew and cargo vehicles, including those currently in service and those in development. This includes the ISS, where the LOOP would be integrated to provide additional volume and even “gravity therapy.”

It could also be integrated into the Lunar Gateway or could act as the habitation module of the proposed Deep Space Transport (DST). Airbus also emphasizes that multiple LOOP modules can be combined to create a full-on space station, each outfitted with various decks to accommodate a range of operations and experiments. In this respect, the LOOP could occupy a role similar to what NASA had in mind with his proposed Non-Atmospheric Universal Transport Intended for Lengthy United States Exploration (Nautilus-X) concept.

There’s no indication yet of how much gravity the Centrifuge will be able to simulate, but some rough calculations using SpinCalc and SpaceCalc provided some estimates. According to both apps, the Centrifuge would need to have an angular velocity of 3.86 m/s (12.66 ft/s) and achieve 9.2 rotations per minute to simulate Martian gravity – 3.72 m/s2, or about 38% of Earth’s. It is possible it could be spun down to 2.55 m/s (8.35 ft/s), making six rotations per minute, to simulate Lunar gravity (about 16.5%) as well.

This would be especially useful during missions to Mars since it would help mitigate the physiological effects of microgravity while acclimating the crew to what they will experience on the surface. Hopefully, more information will be available soon, including radiation shielding, materials, and weight estimates. Needless to say, NASA and other space agencies are facing some significant challenges when it comes to future missions and operations in space. These include renewed lunar exploration and development, the first crewed missions to Mars, and what to do once the ISS is decommissioned.

As always, NASA has called upon the commercial space sector to provide innovative solutions to these challenges, and they are answering!

"Maintaining Airbus, Boeing Balance ‘Really Important,’ Delta CEO Says - Aviation Week","Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvbWFpbnRhaW5pbmctYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1iYWxhbmNlLXJlYWxseS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtZGVsdGEtY2VvLXNheXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK—Delta Air Lines does not currently have plans for an aggressive shift in its fleet makeup between Boeing and Airbus, its top executive says.

“We are always working with Airbus and Boeing, and you’re right, at the current time we’re taking primarily Airbus, but we’re excited to be getting the Boeing MAX in a couple of years,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Aviation Week on the sidelines of a Wings Club luncheon on May 17. “Keeping a balance between Boeing and Airbus product is really important to us.”

The carrier currently operates an in-service fleet of 445 Boeing and 411 Airbus aircraft, according to Aviation Week Network’s Fleet Discovery database, with 216 Airbus and 100 Boeing aircraft on order, comprising A321s, A330s, A350s, A220s and 737-10s.

“We make our decisions on aircraft and spend patterns on the long cycle,” Bastian told the luncheon attendees, noting that the airline is paying cash for fleet investments and expects to make a minimum of $2 billion in free cash in 2023, with the goal of doubling that number in 2024.

“The story of Delta is one of cash, one of free cash,” he added. So far in 2023, the airline has recorded the 20 highest cash sale days in company history, with nearly 60% of Delta’s revenues being non ticket-driven. Business travel levels are only about 80% recovered when compared to 2019—by traditional measure.

“But our economy is larger so that means we’re only probably about two-thirds of the way back,” Bastian added.

Calling summer 2022 very much the summer of domestic travel, Bastian says this is the summer for international, with demand “off the charts.”

“The industry will have a chance to redeem itself a little bit from last summer,” Bastian added. “We all stretched ourselves well beyond, even though we all told ourselves not to do it. It’s hard not to do it when you see that demand that’s coming ... Last summer we weren’t very disciplined, we did everything we could to take in cash. This summer is going to be very much about staying disciplined.”

With a positive outlook that extends past the summer season—“even the early look into the fall is strong”—Bastian said its second quarter (Q2) performance is expected to come “pretty darn close” to Q2 2019.

The Atlanta-based carrier is a part of the Capital Access Alliance, a coalition supporting recently introduced legislation pushing on federal restrictions at Washington Reagan National Airport to add more and longer flights. Though supportive of the effort, the airline is not yet naming any longer routes it would want to see added, should the bill pass.

“We’re not ready to get that far yet,” Bastian told Aviation Week. “We just want to see greater access.”

Delta Air Lines is in talks with Airbus for a significant wide-body aircraft order, according to people familiar with the matter, as rising demand for long-haul flying prompts airlines to restore post-COVID networks and replace older planes.

The talks cover both A350 and A330neo twin-aisle jets, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. An agreement isn't assured, they cautioned. A potential order could total dozens of planes, as Delta works to replace a combined fleet of more than 100 older A330 and Boeing Co. 767 models, one of the people said.

An Airbus spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. Delta had no immediate comment.

Long-distance flying is catching up with short haul's rebound from the COVID travel slump. Airlines are locking in delivery slots in a bet on a sustained recovery, and to ensure access to new jets as manufacturing issues, including shortages of supply and labor, threaten to go on for years.

This year, Delta expects to operate 30% of its capacity on international long-haul routes, similar to the ratio in 2019.

While the Paris Air Show — a showcase for major orders — is approaching next month, the talks may not be advanced enough to for a deal to be reached by then, the people said. Atlanta-based Delta already operates both Airbus models and has hinted at buying more A330s.

It's the biggest operator of that Airbus type, with 63 planes as of March, including 21 of the re-engined A330neo, which touts improved fuel economy. Delta's older A330-200s average 18 years and its A330-300s, 14 years.

Delta also had 28 Airbus A350s — a newer, more advanced aircraft. It had a total of 33 A330s and A350s on order as of March 31.

The airline has also said it could replace Boeing 767s — some of the oldest aircraft in its fleet — with A330neos, noting the improved unit costs.

Delta had 66 767s in its fleet at the end of March, with 767-300ERs averaging 27 years and 767-400ERs at just over 22 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9728057384490967}",neutral,0.9728057384490967,0

One proposed solution rivals the power of fossil fuels without the emissions — hydrogen. With the industry attempting to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, both big players like Airbus and startups alike are exploring the technology.

""Airbus has been looking at hydrogen for a long time and recently, within the last years, has increased that focus. Looking at both hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion"" says Martha Neubauer, senior associate at AeroDynamic Advisory.

Airbus announced concept designs for several zero-emission, hydrogen-powered planes in 2020 and intends to test a hydrogen engine on an A380 in 2026.

Two startups, ZeroAvia and Universal Hydrogen, are also pursuing hydrogen-powered aircraft. Both have recently completed test flights with regional-sized planes and are hoping to enter the market by 2025. But significant challenges lie ahead, from getting regulatory approval to developing the hydrogen infrastructure.

Aero Evacuation: lifesaving missions with military aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA1LWFlcm8tZXZhY3VhdGlvbi1saWZlc2F2aW5nLW1pc3Npb25zLXdpdGgtbWlsaXRhcnktYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Medicalised aircraft such as the Airbus C295 are indispensable tools for crisis evacuation and the transport of critically ill patients.

October 2022. A Hospital in Tenerife. A patient undergoes cardiac surgery to insert an intra-aortic balloon pump, a circulatory support device. The person being operated on, weighing about 100 kilos, suffers a complication that requires transfer to a hospital specialised in complex cardiovascular surgery.

The Spanish Air Force's Aero Evacuation Medical Unit (UMAER), located at the Torrejón base (Madrid), receives the call from the Chief of Staff office, which has approved the request from the hospital. In just two hours, the team configures a C295 aircraft for medical evacuation (Medevac) and flies to Tenerife airport. The patient is waiting on the tarmac on a stretcher connected to two complex systems: the console that regulates the counterpulsation balloon and an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation System (ECMO). The patient and all additional mechanical ventilation equipment is brought into the aircraft through the tailgate. The C295 quickly takes off and flies to Gran Canaria island, and then continues the transfer by road to the Hospital Negrín.

In an earlier mission, a medicalised C295 from UMAER urgently evacuated another extremely critical patient, also on ECMO, from Palma de Mallorca to Madrid. This time it was a 12-month-old boy, who was treated in the Pneumology Intensive Care Unit of the 12 de Octubre hospital.

Thanks to these timely interventions both the adult and the child would live.

Francisco Cantalejo, the UMAER’s Head of Operations, recounts two of the situations he has had to deal with: ""When dealing with critically ill patients, the advantage of the C295 is that its tailgate allows us to bring bulky medical equipment into the aircraft and work seamlessly 360 degrees around the stretcher.""

""In the UMAER, we are a team. When you get on a plane you are no longer a military rank but a member of a medical team where we are all equal and where each of us has our own mission,"" says Francisco Cantalejo (centre of the photo.) Courtesy of Francisco Cantalejo / UMAER

Transfer of critically ill patients and humanitarian missions by military transport aircraft

The UMAER has evacuated Ebola-infected patients in Sierra Leone and Liberia, assisted in the evacuation of thousands of Afghan refugees from Kabul during the airlift in 2021 and carried out numerous patient transfer missions affected by COVID-19.

""We perform about 40 missions a year. They are mostly medical aero-evacuations of between one and three patients, whether civilians or military personnel deployed on operation, but we also carry out international missions to respond to natural disasters or crisis situations,"" Francisco points out.

UMAER: on 24-hour alert, operational in just two hours

Whenever there is a request for assistance, the head of UMAR - Pilar Salvador - manages the availability of the aircraft and activates her team accordingly. For example, in a recent emergency of a patient with a time-dependent blood disorder pathology, an A400M was selected to fly from Iraq to Turkey, as only armored aircraft are allowed to land at Baghdad airport. An UMAER team then flew to Turkey to return the patient in a medicalised flight to Spain.

Francisco, as chief of operations, is in charge of assessing the clinical condition of the patient or persons to be evacuated and which personnel are needed; the medical officers on duty organise the material required for the mission - stretchers, electro-medical equipment, disposable bags, etc. - and the medical technicians prepare the aircraft's configuration and medicalised pallets.

The UMAER works in coordination with the Air Force's 45th Transport Group, 31st Wing and 35th Wing units and platforms such as the Airbus A400M, C295 and A310, as well as Falcon 900. The unit is also integrated into the European Air Transport Command (EATC), located in Eindhoven, which manages a shared fleet of aircraft from seven countries for air mobility and aero-evacuation missions within Europe.

""We are often called upon by the EATC, both because of our location in the southern part of Europe and because of our flexibility and capacity to react quickly,"" explains Francisco. ""We are on standby 24 hours a day, seven days a week. From the moment we are activated, within an hour we are able to have an Intensive Surveillance Unit ready to mount on a C295 or A400M, with equipment structures weighing around 1,200 kilos, to be able to deploy for an evacuation mission in just two hours.""

Numerous armed forces used the A400M (pictured here), A330 MRTT and C295 in Medevac and transport missions helping in the fight against the COVID-19.

The challenges of aero-medical evacuation

An anesthesiologist by training, Francisco has always felt that, ""to be able to help in situations of maximum hospital emergency,"" was his thing. ""Setting up an ICU on an airplane is exciting, but there is no room for you to become complacent, the work is different from any hospital facility. Patients are often in critical condition and can get worse just by moving around an air environment.""

That's why factors such as ergonomics and accessibility are vital within a Medevac cabin.

Now, based on experience with other military aircraft such as the A400M and A330 MRTT, Airbus teams have developed a new Intensive Care Transport Module for the C295. ""Our main objective is for it to be a low-cost, modular solution, allowing the same aircraft to be used for various types of missions, either with all the equipment as a mobile ICU or a more basic configuration,"" explains project lead Ángel Sánchez Franco, who is also head of C295 product policy and business development at Airbus Defence and Space.

The development of this mobile ICU is the result of Airbus' experience designing different types of Medevac solutions over the years and discussions held with UMAER and area forces such as the Portuguese or Czech. ""We have integrated direct feedback from medical teams such as varying the placement of oxygen cylinders to stay out of the way or having a greater number of plugs. In addition, we have designed a new quick-attach mechanism so that the module can be quickly assembled and disassembled,"" says Ángel.

Airbus wants to make this innovation a solution that can be installed on all its military transport aircraft. ""Versatility is the great advantage of the C295, a single platform allows you to do a multitude of different missions,"" says Ángel, who is in frequent contact with the aircraft's operators to respond to their needs. ""In addition to passenger transport, the C295 can be quickly configured to transport cargo or for medical evacuation of patients, or equipped with a multitude of sensors for surveillance, search and rescue tasks"".

On medical evacuation flights, the UMAER transports oxygen for 12 extra hours if there is a hospital close to the base where the aircraft lands, or is extended to 24 extra hours if, on the other hand, the area of operations is conflictive or the weather forecast is adverse.

Spanish Air Force: A vocation to serve the public

""In the UMAER, we are a team. When you get on a plane you are no longer a military rank but a member of a medical team where we are all equal and where each of us has our own mission,"" emphasises Francisco, who has been with the unit for more than 25 years. ""There are moments at the end of a complex mission, when we are collecting the equipment from the aircraft, when we look at each other and we say to each other in a good way: 'what a crazy thing we have done'.""

The emotional connection extends to patients as well, as evidenced by the fact that the UMAER team maintains contact with many of the people they have treated. ""When you do evacuations of this kind, there are gestures that you don't forget: a look from a patient, the way they hold your hand, ask you to take them home... Sharing their joy when you bring them back is a very special emotion,"" says Francisco, recalling one of his first missions, the transfer of several children injured in the 1998 Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland. ""Sometimes this work is very hard, because things don't always go well. But when you manage to save a life, the collective satisfaction is incredible. It's the best feeling in the world.""

Arabsat Badr-8 successfully launched: featuring Airbus' innovative optical communications payload TELEO - Airbus,"Sat, 27 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNS1hcmFic2F0LWJhZHItOC1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWQtZmVhdHVyaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1pbm5vdmF0aXZl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 27 May 2023 - The Airbus-built Arabsat Badr-8 telecommunications satellite has been successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Based on Airbus’ latest geostationary Eurostar Neo satellite, Badr-8 will provide connectivity for users across Europe, Middle East, Africa, and central Asia.

The spacecraft is also equipped with a world first, Airbus’ innovative space demonstrator TELEO to provide space to ground optical communications at gigabit speeds. The TELEO demonstrator payload is designed to facilitate very high capacity optical feeder link communications, playing a crucial role in Airbus’ development of a new generation of optical communications technology in space.

Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems said: “Marking our third successful launch of the Eurostar Neo series and our eighth spacecraft built for Arabsat, Badr-8, equipped with the very innovative TELEO payload, is the latest major milestone for our telecoms business. Featuring increased payload capacity and more efficient power and thermal control systems, Badr-8 will replace and increase Arabsat’s capacity.

Following the successful launch and separation, Badr-8 is using its electric propulsion system to reach geostationary orbit at 36,000 km. The satellite will then undergo a comprehensive testing period in geostationary orbit before entering full service. With a launch mass of 4.5 tons and 17.8 kW of power, the satellite is designed to operate in orbit for 15 years. Airbus’ ultra-reliable geostationary telecommunications satellites have achieved more than 1,300 years of service in orbit.

Airbus’ Eurostar Neo platform has been developed in the frame of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Partnership Projects, together with the French space agency CNES, and strongly supported by the UK Space Agency and other agencies across Europe. The TELEO demonstrator payload was developed with support from CNES.

Airbus: A Focus On Innovation - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hLWZvY3VzLW9uLWlubm92YXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global commercial helicopter market is on a path to recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic that shook the industry and its supply chain. Airbus Helicopters is evolving with the market, meeting the needs of its customers so they can continue to perform essential missions.

The company has risen to the challenge, implementing a global transformation plan to improve how it designs, produces, and maintains the current fleet of Airbus helicopters all while preparing for the future.

From digitalization, to enhanced safety and upgraded performance, Airbus’s approach encompasses a range of missions and conditions that its partners and operators face every day. Airbus aims to help its customers make the world a safer place, unite people who are passionate about helicopters, and constantly innovate to create quieter and cleaner rotorcraft.

Desruptive Lab 1th flight, with Samuel CHARTIER,Experimental Test Pilot, and Alain DELAVET, Flight Test Ingineer, at Airbus Helicopters, Marignane.

At this year’s HAI Heli-Expo, showgoers can see first-hand how Airbus is pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world. Its H160 will be on display, alongside the versatile H125, and the tailored ACH130 Aston Martin edition, not to mention a dedicated innovation experience and Airbus’s efficient support and services solutions.

Airbus’s next-generation helicopter, the H160, has gained ground as a key addition to a variety of customers’ fleets, entering into service in Japan, Brazil and across Europe. With orders in mission segments ranging from search-and-rescue, to law enforcement, to public services, and private and business aviation, the aircraft is also set to become a crucial partner in the energy sector, supporting operators and customers, such as PHI and Shell.

Incorporating as many as 68 patents, the H160’s value-add across the entire range of mission segments notably resides in its innovative, safety-enhancing design. Featuring the brightest cabin of its class, and equipped with a vortex pre-alerting feature, as well as cutting-edge automation modes, the H160 enables crew members to focus on crucial tasks and drastically reduces pilot workload.

Customer centricity is paramount to meeting each operator’s distinctive needs and requirements, especially for support and services. The addition of ZF Luftfahrttechnik to Airbus Helicopters’ portfolio at the end of 2022 is a prime example of how the company is broadening its range of maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, and securing additional competences in dynamic systems — notably for the H135 and H145 helicopters.

Airbus strives to integrate customers’ feedback every step along the way, and reshaping its support solutions is testimony to this commitment. After launching an updated HCare offer at Heli-Expo 2022, customers now have access to three flexible solutions to support them from the day their new helicopter enters service until the end of its life. Thanks to a suite of digital tools and step-by-step assistance, Airbus Helicopters brings in new solutions that match operators’ needs, easing rotorcraft maintenance while optimizing its health and usage.

Innovation remains a key focus at Airbus Helicopters. In December 2022, Airbus unveiled its DisruptiveLab, a new demonstrator that will enable the company to further test technologies that reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 50 percent. With the goal to evaluate a new aerodynamic architecture intended to reduce fuel consumption, as well as pursue the implementation of hybridization, the DisruptiveLab kicked off its flight test campaign in January 2023.

Reducing the carbon footprint of its aircraft is equally served by its efforts to make advanced air mobility a reality. After selecting partners for the CityAirbus NextGen’s structural components, the eVTOL aircraft is now getting closer to its testing phase. To prepare for entry into service, Airbus has partnered with a series of major industrial and institutional players, including Chile-based operator Ecocopter, Italian flag carrier ITA Airways, and Japanese operator Hiratagakuen, to create the necessary ecosystems to launch this new mobility service across continents.

Airbus’s unwavering priority is to help countries protect their citizens and make their critical missions possible. Suited for intensive care transport and designed to comply with the requirements set by national medical regulatory agencies, the five-bladed H145 has become a game-changer for medical services providers.

When it comes to saving lives, helicopters provide an unparalleled advantage to intervene within the “golden hour.” The H145 is just the right fit, with its spacious cabin, increased payload, and eased maintenance process, overall improving the helicopter’s performance and availability.

Meanwhile, the H125 is also making a difference for law enforcement customers. Less than a year after the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department ordered two H125s, both aircraft have been delivered and placed in service — further evidence of how the H125 has become an important lever to help make the world a safer place.

With its versatility and maneuverability, the helicopter is well-adapted to a variety of public service operations, including surveillance, search-and-rescue, and command and control. The rotorcraft benefits from bespoke equipment to meet the most demanding police mission requirements. Night vision goggle-compatible instruments, searchlights, hoist, high-resolution camera (optical sensor) with mapping system, and wire strike protection are just a few of the available additions to the H125’s law enforcement configuration.

Airbus has also made it a mission to unite people who are passionate about helicopters, and support those who fly them. The elegant ACH130 Aston Martin edition is proof of how Airbus Corporate Helicopters is rising to the challenge of providing private and business aviation customers with a tailored flight experience. Designed in partnership with luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin, the ACH130 provides increased comfort and refined aesthetics, while integrating the company’s latest innovations to improve safety of flight and support customers in taking a step toward reduced carbon emissions, with 10 percent more power and lower fuel consumption.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9853498935699463}",positive,0.9853498935699463,1
UAE cancels €800m military helicopter deal with Airbus: Government official - Breaking Defense,"Tue, 09 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3VhZS1jYW5jZWxzLWU4MDBtLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZGVhbC13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW9mZmljaWFsL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3VhZS1jYW5jZWxzLWU4MDBtLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZGVhbC13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW9mZmljaWFsLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BEIRUT — The UAE has terminated a nearly €800 million contract to procure 12 H225 Caracal multirole helicopters from French aircraft giant Airbus, a government official exclusively told Breaking Defense.

“We recently terminated a contract with Airbus Helicopters to purchase H225 helicopters. We found it difficult to continue the contract due to the high lifecycle cost, the limitations in adapting to modular designs of future mission requirements, and the complex technical proposal,” Muammar Abdulla Abushehab, defense and security industry affairs sector chief for the Tawazun council, said in a May 8 interview.

The Tawazun council is the UAE’s independent government entity that works closely with the Ministry of Defense and security agencies in the United Arab Emirates, and it is assigned, among other roles, the research and development as well as technological innovation side of the sector.

Requests for comment to Airbus were not returned by press time.

Abushehab said the cancellation was not a political one, but based entirely on financial and technical reasons. “The company lacked the serious motivation to respond to our demands in order to meet the pressing requirements of the government. The failure to achieve in-country value goals was another factor in the decision to terminate the contract,” he said.

In December 2021, UAE ordered 12 H225M Caracal helicopters during the French president’s visit for an estimated price of €750-€800 million. The H225M is the military version of the H225 and can be mounted with different sets of weaponry, from machine guns to rockets to anti-ship missiles. It is operational within the French air force, and has been contracted for export by 11 customers.

Speaking more broadly about the Tawazun Council’s role in the defense sector, Abushehab said his mandate “includes managing governmental defense and security research and development activities, including dual-use applications, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense.”

He added that the main R&D goal is to support acquisition operations, generate intellectual property and product lines and outsource them to industry, and nurture national talents.

“At this point in time, our primary focus is on developing in-country value through all of the operations that we undertake in collaboration with both our local and our international partners,” he said. Tawazun Council has signed contracts with major defense contractors to codevelop in its labs in the UAE. These firms include Raytheon, Boeing, Leonardo, Saab, L3 Harris and others.

“Defense contractors can now obtain offset credits by participating in economic activities that boost the local economy, accelerate technology and know-how transfer, provide job and training opportunities, and improve the supply chain,” he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9449203610420227}",neutral,0.9449203610420227,0
“The father of them all”: How the Barracuda drone's legacy flies on - Airbus,"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA1LXRoZS1mYXRoZXItb2YtdGhlbS1hbGwtaG93LXRoZS1iYXJyYWN1ZGEtZHJvbmVzLWxlZ2FjeS1mbGllcy1vbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some 20 years ago, Airbus pioneers made a unique drone technology demonstrator fly in just 40 months. After six test campaigns, the Barracuda was retired. But its technologies will fly on - in two of Europe's largest defence projects: the Eurodrone and the Future Combat Air System.

The most emotional moment in Peter Hunkel's professional life lasted all of 15 minutes. Flashback to Sunday, April 2, 2006: The wall clock in the ground control station at San Javier/Murcia Airport in Spain shows 6:14 a.m. It's time to get going. After receiving the ‘take off’ command at the click of a mouse, the unmanned Barracuda technology demonstrator automatically releases its brakes, goes into full thrust and takes off after less than 1,000 metres. The drone flies autonomously over the Mediterranean as programmed and lands safely at 6:30 a.m. All the tension of the past few months dissipates as the team at the ground station and on the tarmac cheer exuberantly.

""It was an incredible feeling, we had achieved the seemingly impossible,"" says Peter Hunkel, who, as programme manager, made the Barracuda fly with a core team of 35 colleagues. And they did it in record time: it took just 40 months from the first design of the aircraft to the first flight. ""That's very impressive - other aircraft often take decades to take off for the first time,"" explains Mario Kalanja, who designed the Barracuda.

The Barracuda takes off on its maiden flight

Secret programme, small bubble and agile development

The Barracuda project was launched in early 2003 at Airbus in Manching, Europe's leading military aviation centre. Initially, the project was run in secrecy as a so-called ""black programme"". And that was a good thing, recalls Thomas Gottmann, the Barracuda's chief engineer at the time: ""We were few people, in one building, had short distances, hardly any admin, and the full support of management. In short, we were working in a bubble and needed only to worry about one thing: developing the largest unmanned aircraft in Europe at the time in the shortest possible time."" To do this, the team closely analysed civil and military aircraft development, then streamlined and simplified it.

""We were 'agile' before the term was even invented,"" adds Peter Hunkel. The project was financed from the company's own funds, with additional support from the German Federal Ministry of Defense, the German Procurement agency BAAINBw and the Wehrtechnische Dienststellen (WTD).

""Building an aircraft that looks like a combat aircraft""

The result is something to behold: The jet-powered Barracuda is made almost entirely of carbon fiber composites. It is over eight metres long and its wingspan measures over seven metres. Its maximum take-off mass is more than three tons. The Barracuda flies automatically and is connected via several data links to the ground control station from which the aircraft is monitored and commanded only by high-level commands.

But why does the Barracuda actually look the way it does? ""I was tasked to design an unmanned aircraft that would look like a 'combat aircraft’,"" explains designer Kalanja. ""It was also to be stealthy and have a low radar signature. In that respect, the stealth and aerodynamics rules dictated the design to have similar leading and trailing edges for the wings and for vertical and horizontal tails to keep radar reflections aligned in certain directions.”

Setback, comeback and 6 successful flight campaigns

The project suffered a setback in September 2006 when the Barracuda crashed into the sea on its second test flight during the landing approach. After a thorough investigation of the causes in collaboration with the German Air Force, the platform was rebuilt, incorporating the results of previous tests and the necessary improvements. Two and a half years later, in 2009, the Barracuda launched again. In this flight campaign, the team tested the drone's reconnaissance capabilities and how its flight path could be shaped using the images and video it transmitted.

This was followed in 2010 by tests of the co-operative anti-collision system, which allows the drone to avoid other aircraft, such as commercial airliners. Structure integrated antennae were also tested on the Barracuda. In 2012, the team tested how to automatically adjust the drone's flight path, for example, if the airspace proves impassable due to a threat. Automatic ground target recognition was also demonstrated during the 2012 flight campaign. The final flight campaign tested how the Barracuda can monitor and track targets in combination with a manned aircraft with data fusion from different sensors on different flying platforms.

The legacy flies on

All of these technologies are now ready to launch for two of the largest defense projects in Europe: the first large-scale European military drone, Eurodrone, and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS). ""The Barracuda is the father of them all,"" Hunkel says. ""A lot of it goes back to our demonstrator."" That's true, for example, of the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance technologies that will be used in the Eurodrone when it enters service later this decade.

FCAS, which is expected to be operational by 2040, will also benefit from the technologies and lessons learned from the Barracuda. Especially when it comes to the interaction of manned and unmanned aircraft. In FCAS, Remote Carrier drones with different sizes and capabilities are vital assets. They will operate in a team with the manned New Generation Fighter and the Eurofighter, supporting their pilots in their missions and taking on dangerous tasks such as taking out enemy air defences or investigating potential threats in hostile territory.

""None of this would be possible without the Barracuda UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) system,"" says Thomas Gottmann, adding, ""the Barracuda is truly unique - it's good to know that some of the things we developed then will fly on in the latest state-of-the art products, helping to ensure Europe’s sovereignty and autonomy.""

Emirates Airline accounts for about 72% of the total capacity offered with 2.3 million seats across almost 4,500 flights. British Airways (BA) ranks second with 245,000 seats and Singapore Airlines third with 229,000.

The latest figures provided by OAG Schedules Analyser show that Dubai-based Emirates’ A380 capacity has now exceeded the total available in May 2019.

Dubai International (DXB) unsurprisingly tops the list when it comes to the top 10 airports worldwide, ranked by the most A380 departure seats during May 2023. In total, there are more than 1.1 million departure seats from DXB, marking a rise of 1.3% on May 2019.

All other airports in the top 10 have witnessed a drop in capacity compared with pre-pandemic levels, apart from Johannesburg, which is up by almost 99% thanks to double-daily service from both BA and Emirates.

Looking at the biggest airport pairs, Dubai features in the top six by A380 capacity this month. The schedules data shows that Dubai-London Heathrow has the largest volume of available A380 seats, totaling over 205,000.

The biggest A380 route not to touch Dubai is London Heathrow-Singapore with 88,500 monthly seats. Overall, 73 airport pairs worldwide have received A380 flights during May 2023.

The total A380 capacity available worldwide now exceeds 3.2 million monthly seats, although the figure represents a drop of some 31% on pre-pandemic levels. However, capacity will rise further in June and July as Etihad Airways and Lufthansa are poised to return the aircraft to commercial service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999438524246216}",neutral,0.9999438524246216,0

Delta Air Lines in widebody order talks with Airbus - report - ch-aviation,"Fri, 19 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9wb3J0YWwvbmV3cy8xMjc3OTctZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLWluLXdpZGVib2R5LW9yZGVyLXRhbGtzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines (DL, Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson) is reportedly talking to Airbus about an order for ""dozens"" of widebodies, according to Bloomberg. The report cites an insider close to the talks who says both A330-900Ns and A350 models are under consideration to replace older, existing A330s and B767 types.

While talks remain ongoing, there is a tentative expectation that an announcement may be made at the upcoming Paris Air Show. Delta Air Lines already operates A330-900Ns and A350-900s, but also has a large stock of older A330-200, A330-300, B767-300ER, and B767-400ER types.

According to ch-aviation fleets data, Delta now operates twenty-two A330-900Ns, with an average fleet age of 1.9 years. It also has a further 16 on order. The airline also has twenty-eight A350-900s in its fleet, with an average fleet age of 4.6 years. There are another six still to be delivered.

Among the older widebodies Delta is reportedly looking to replace, there are eleven A330-200s with an average fleet age of 18.1 years, thirty-one A330-300s with an average fleet age of 14.4 years, forty-five B767-300ERs with an average fleet age of 27.2 years, and twenty-one B767-400ERs with an average fleet age of 22.4 years.

While the report did not specify which A350 variant the airline was eyeing, there was speculation late last year that Delta was looking to order A350-1000s. That speculation was linked to the then cancelled Qatar Airways (QR, Doha Hamad International) order, which saw Airbus holding onto completed or about to be completed A350s, and reports Delta was looking for a sharp deal to take the aircraft off the manufacturer's hands. However, the legal dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways is now settled and the order for twenty-three A350-1000s reinstated.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999958276748657}",neutral,0.9999958276748657,0

The European plane maker revealed a lower-than-expected drop in its core earnings for the period, with commercial aircraft revenues declining by 5% to €11.8bn (US$13bn). Operating earnings for the group stood at €773m (US$854m), down 39% year-on-year.

In total, 127 airframes were delivered in Q1, including ten A220s, 106 A320 family, six A330s and five A350s. Meanwhile, there were 156 gross commercial aircraft orders, bringing the backlog to 7,254 commercial airframes.

“Strong Demand”

Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, said, “The first quarter confirmed strong demand for our products, particularly for commercial aircraft. We delivered 127 commercial aircraft, which is reflected in the Q1 financials. The quarter also benefited from a good performance in Helicopters.”

Indeed, Airbus Helicopters bagged 39 net orders during Q1 with an EBIT increasing to €156m (US$172m). Its Defence and Space order intake value stood at €2.5bn (US$2.7bn), but its EBIT was down to €36m (US$39m) compared to €106m (US$117) in Q1 2022.

The lower-than-expected results were partly blamed on “an adverse operating environment that includes in particular persistent tensions in the supply chain,” Mr Faury said. US engine maker Pratt & Whitney was singled out after issues with its GTF engines, especially in hot and dusty climates that have led to quicker than anticipated wear on the power plants.

A350F Delay

The results also revealed a delay in the entry-into-service of its A350 freighter. Despite the first components for the new cargo jet being produced by Airbus Atlantic in Nantes, the manufacturer said that “the industrial planning for this variant is being slightly adjusted with the entry-into-service now slipping into 2026.”

However, service entry of the new A321XLR is still expected to occur during the second quarter of 2024 as its flight test program progresses.

Airbus is also ramping up production of its other commercial airframes, including the A220, up to 14 per month “by the middle of the decade,” and the A320 family, which is expected to produce 65 aircraft per month by the end of 2024. The announcement of a second Final Assembly Line in Tianjin, China, has helped this target. Meanwhile, the company aims to produce four A330s per month in 2024 and nine A350s monthly by the end of 2025.

Airbus's Future Planes Will Have See-Through Ceilings So You Can Gaze at the Stars While You Fly - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXBsYW5lcy1sb29rLTIwMzUtMTkwMDAwMTIzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus just gave jet-setters a glimpse at the future of the in-flight experience.

The aerospace giant presented its next-gen aircraft cabin during a virtual media briefing. Developed in partnership with 10 airlines and eight technology firms, Airspace is at the bleeding edge of aeronautical design and will shape how the company creates jet interiors from 2035 onwards.

More from Robb Report

The company says the concept is built on three pillars: transparency, decarbonization, and circularity. That’s a fancy way of saying the cabin is eco-friendly and will help offset each plane’s carbon footprint. Of course, Airbus says fliers can expect more personalized service, better seats, additional smart devices, and an “enhanced atmosphere.” The enhancements, it appears, will include a see-through ceiling that allows passengers to gaze up at the clouds or stars while flying—or soak in some natural light.

Airspace cabins will help to offset the plane’s carbon emissions.

In terms of transparency, passengers will be able to easily view the environmental impact of each flight via a mobile travel companion app, which will also offer options for ways to offset carbon emissions.

Speaking of decarbonization, Airbus claims the easiest way to cut emissions is to reduce the plane’s weight. To that end, the new cabins will feature a “bionic design” that will reportedly lower a plane’s weight by 40 percent. Part of this reduction comes from new catering and trolley concepts that would reduce the galley weight. Pre-ordering food on long-range flights could lower waste and weight by 15 percent, for instance.

Passengers will be able to see the environmental impact of each flight.

As for circularity, Airbus says it will rethink its cabin materials, opting for versions it can recycle, repair, and reuse.

So, when will Airspace take flight? Airbus will begin making changes to its existing cabin range this year, but will fully introduce the concept with its next generation of aircraft. The company says it will provide more information about the new cabins at the 2023 Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany next week. Stay tuned.

Joe Anselmo:

Welcome to this week's Check 6 Podcast. I'm Joe Anselmo, Aviation Week's Editorial Director.

He's done it again. Aviation Week Senior Editor, Guy Norris has rolled out another scoop, this one the latest cover story in the April 24th edition of Aviation Week magazine. Guy's story reveals how a California startup named JetZero is aiming to develop a blended wing body aircraft that could serve the US Air Force's desire for a new tanker transport. But it's more than that. This aircraft also could be repurposed as a commercial mid-market airliner, putting JetZero up squarely against the seemingly impenetrable Airbus-Boeing duopoly.

Audacious? For sure. But the fact that JetZero is partnering with Northrop Grumman shows that this project is more than a pipe dream.

Joining us today to discuss all of this are: Guy Norris; Aviation Week columnist Richard Aboulafia of Aerodynamic Advisory, who has visited JetZero and met with its founders. And rounding us out is Aviation Week Military Editor Steve Trimble, who has written for decades on blended wing bodied concepts.

Guy, let's kickoff with you. Really quickly, could you tell our listeners, first of all what a blended wing body aircraft is and why JetZero thinks this is the way to go?

Guy Norris:

Hi, Joe. The blended wing body concept for those that don't know is essentially where an airframe structure and the aerodynamics are blended. So, when you imagine normally you have a distinct fuselage with wings attached to the outside. This time it's a seamless transition between the two. And this enables the fuselage to actually contribute to the lift. That's the huge part of the blended wing body secret, really. It's also known generically as a hybrid wing body. But the configuration is usually tailless and it's more efficient because obviously, you've got a reduced wetted area, there's less friction and lower form drag.

So, the additional benefit of this is not only do you get all this extra lift for free, but that's another debate. But you also get the fact that the engines have to be above the body, so therefore they're shielded from the ground. So it's a lot quieter too. So it ticks the boxes in an awful lot of ways as far as the nice aircraft to have for the future, both from a sustainability and a noise and environmental perspective.

And JetZero, just to quickly follow on from that, has been operating in stealth for a couple of years and it's emerged just now because it has found this moment in time when it's able to address a military and commercial market simultaneously. And because this military market will basically reveal its existence, it has decided the time is right to come out into the open. So, it's an exciting project. And I think it's well worth paying attention to.

Joe Anselmo:

And the way it works is they would develop it as a tanker for an Air Force program and then also it would be repurposed as a mid-market airliner, correct?

Guy Norris:

Exactly. So this is the point of why this serendipity really is quite valuable to look at now. They've seen the fact that the Air Force is interested finally in adapting this concept for a future tanker transport. And at the same time, it just so happens, that that would make a pretty darn good 250, 220-seat type commercial aircraft, which oh, just happens to fill the mid-market sector, which Boeing and Airbus are really not addressing directly at the moment with any of their products or in the foreseeable future.

So, a bit like Boeing in the mid-'1950s when it developed the Dash 80, the D367-80 model, which ultimately became the Boeing 707 and the KC-135. They see a similar window of opportunity here to rewrite the landscape or redraw it, I should say, for commercial aviation.

Joe Anselmo:

Richard, you and your colleague, Kevin Michaels, have been out to JetZero and talked with them. What did you guys see and what do you think of it?

Richard Aboulafia:

It was pretty remarkable. A terrific team of folks. Their facilities are modest. Obviously, this is one of those typical startup ‘just-add-capital’ stories. But there's no denying the passion and the intriguing idea pretty much exactly what Guy, I think, was talking about before. It's hard to not be attracted to a promising new technology. It's been around.

And a couple themes that really appeal to me, one, people view technology as something that just happens and reinvents everything rather than the historical model of technology, which is that very often it's around for many decades and suddenly finds relevance. There are many other examples of that in history, and this certainly fits that pattern. David Edgerton wrote a great book called The Shock of the Old that talks about the historical parallels in technology development. And BWB of course, has been around for a great many decades and it suddenly seems to have this tremendous relevance.

The other thing that really hit me was this going in as a taker and then finding the commercial relevance that Guy talks about. Because right now, it does seem incredibly neglected as a very promising business opportunity. You've got the A321neo, which is not very good for this mission, but its what everyone has to buy because Boeing has said they're not doing anything. So. you come in with something disruptive, hey, there's something there. And not only that, you've got Northrop's involvement as a tanker, as you say. I think that's important.

As we all know, the defense contractors became pure plays. How do we entice some of them to get back into the commercial world? And this might be exactly the way to do that.

Joe Anselmo:

I want to get to Steve, but Guy, one follow-up to what Richard just said, what are the advertised benefits of this commercial aircraft in terms of fuel burn, and operating costs, and things like that? What's the advantage of going with a blended wing body?

Guy Norris:

We mentioned the position of the engines and the quiet side of things and how it would address any concerns you have on airport environment noise. But essentially, the key parameter from an airline economics perspective is the fact that you could look at between 30% and 50% lower fuel burn from the lower drag that I mentioned as far as the form factor of this blended wing body design. So, that immediately changes the game, because as a modern structure, this would be built from composites, therefore you have the advantages of that lightweight structure. But you've also got the ability therefore, to lift this aircraft, which would be, we should say that the concept they're looking at is about the size of a wing span of about an A330, but shorter than a 767, so if you can picture that combination.

But yet that's obviously a widebody sized aircraft, but it would be powered by either Pratt & Whitney PW 1100 geared turbofan or the CFM LEAP. So you're talking about an aircraft that traditionally would be powered by 50-60,000 pound thrust engines being powered instead by something about 35,000 pounds. And of course, this is a generation of engines that we know and love that have been optimized to for lower fuel burn anyway. So, the combination of those two factors plus the low noise of the upper mounted engines means that this would really fulfill a lot of the demands and wishes, particularly for the mid-market, which as Richard mentioned, is significantly underserved right now.

Joe Anselmo:

Steve Trimble, they've teed it up for you. You buying what you hear?

Steve Trimble:

I tend to be the glass-half-empty perspective on the staff, and it's definitely true with blended wing body, which I've written about in mini surges of interest over the past 20 years, really since the concept really got going by Bob Liebeck at McDonnell Douglass in 1993, 1994, that timeframe. And he was really the pioneer of all this. And then Boeing of course, and McDonnell Douglas became the same company and he tried to get it going there. But there were always some challenges, which Liebeck has always acknowledged, and I'm sure Guy is very well aware of, and Richard. I think those challenges are still with us. So, I'd like to go over them, a few of them, and see what Guy and Richard think about it.

There is an efficiency improvement obviously when you go from basically that circular fuselage structure that is just along for the ride aerodynamically speaking, not really contributing to the lift. If anything, detracting significantly from it, versus a full flying wing where much more of the structure is involved in producing lift, so you do get that efficiency. But it does come at a price.

The first is that it's hard to beat the load efficiency of a circular structure like a fuselage. And that's really how the industry consolidated on that shape to begin with. When you start making that center body shape rectangular or some other non-circular shape, you lose a lot of that strength advantage. And so what that means is you just have to bulk it up more. You have to make it stronger than it would be compared to a circular structure. And therefore, some of the efficiency advantages of a blended wing body starts eroding.

Now, that's less of an issue, say for a military application that the Air Force is studying it for, because their business model, as you might say, is not so tied on cost-effectiveness. They're about mission execution with some interest in making it as cost-effective as possible. Whereas airlines are much more about the cost-effectiveness.

And not only that, it's not just the outside, but internally it's also very difficult to pressurize a non-circular structure. So what you're going to have probably are circular pressure vessels within that blended wing body center body, which means that you're going to have a lot of space where you can put some things in the non-pressurized space, but there's just going to be a lot of inefficient use of space compared to a circular fuselage.

So ,those are some of the classic issues with it. We could talk about some other things. Those engines ingesting the boundary layer on the back, the trailing edge of the thing are great. From a maintenance perspective and access, it's a little less so. That's come up in a lot of these conversations.

Passengers are going to have to adapt to this kind of cabin, which is going to be a lot different than what they're used to. Probably won't have windows. May have skylights in the case of JetZero, which would be interesting when we go back to that structural loading conversation and how they're able to manage that. And egress has also been an issue when you talk about passenger applications.

I would also add that, I don't know this for a fact, but I suspect it may be difficult to customize or tailor the size of the blended wing body for a specific applications. So everybody probably listening to this podcast is well aware that there's a 737-7. There's a 737-8, a 737-9, and A320 and A321. And it's very straightforward to do that with a circular fuselage structure. You put a structural plug ahead of the wing and a structural plug after the wing, or actually on either side or the center of gravity, and you've got a larger or smaller aircraft depending on what mission application you're trying to tailor it for. It's not quite as straightforward with the blended wing body. You probably have to do that change if you're going to do it laterally instead of lengthwise, which creates some issues for gate access and other things.

So, from a military standpoint, and there is definite military interest, in fact, I think I actually broke the story on that with the Air Force reviving their interest in blend wing body based on some comments made at actually Aviation Week's MRO Americas Conference by an Air Force official last year. They are definitely pursuing this as a possible option for a next generation tanker and airlifter that would enter service at some time in the mid to late 2030s. I think there's probably merit to all that depending on what the Air Force decides to do and what requirements they establish for themselves. But the conversion to an airliner application, there's always been some issues with that. And I'm not sure if they've been completely addressed yet with the JetZero application.

Joe Anselmo:

Richard, even if it did work, if you look at the history of the Airbus Boeing duopoly, Embraer looked at taking it on, decided against it. Bombardier did at the lower end with the C Series, developed a great airplane, and then they got crushed and ended up having to sell it for a dollar to Airbus and get out of the commercial aircraft business. Comac only exists because of the Chinese government and really isn't a threat. So what makes this different?

Richard Aboulafia:

Obviously that's the issue, barriers to entry. And this is an industry based on scale. And of course, it's an industry based upon commodity pricing, which means you go in expecting to make money in say year three, and everyone crushes you, just like you say about Bombardier. What's different this time is that possible in ramp via the military side. The prospect of moving up the learning curve and finding someone who's behind you that is deeply capitalized and then going with you down the commercial road, that's completely different from Bombardier or Embraer and certainly Comac.

And this is a long shot, right? But once upon a time, Northrop Grumman had a sizable commercial unit. They built the barrel of the 747s, as a matter of fact. Lockheed of course, had a very large commercial side, L-1011 and whatever else, and other transports. Who's to say that Northrop Grumman gets into this, likes what they see, sees a better mousetrap on the commercial side and says, ""All right, let's get back into the commercial world""? And that would be intriguing.

Because you look at the world of possible new entrants and something that would break the duopoly. Two things are needed, one is for one of the duopolists to fall asleep at the switch and God knows it sure seems to be the case with Boeing right now, unless they decide to reverse their no-new-product this decade mantra. And the other thing that's needed is somebody with really deep pockets. And that of course, could be Northrop Grumman. So, I think this could be different, but it's far from a slam dunk.

Guy Norris:

And to Richard's point, I think the other thing that seems to be relevant in this regard is the fact that the supplier base as well seemed very keen on there being a third player in this market. So, if we believe what JetZero is saying, they say the reaction they've had across the industry has been remarkably positive. So we could be looking at a large base of industrial and supply base, which would be part of this process. It's not just a long shot in that regard. It seems that there are keen participants out there potentially looking at the duopoly and maybe changing the game here a little bit.

And of course, we mustn't forget, we've mentioned it before, but this middle market sector is crying out for a response and it's simply not being met. Airbus and Boeing have both decided for their various reasons, they just can't afford to or do not want to upset the apple cart right now. And neither is willing to push that way into the market. So, there is an opportunity, a genuine need.

And can I just say quickly about some of the criticisms, Steve, rightly so mentioned 'cause he's right. The blended wing body has been around a long time and why hasn't it happened before? It's a legitimate set of questions.

Egress for example, the design details that JetZero shared with us show that bizarrely there are actually as many exits available, say for a wheels-up landing for egress as there are on tube and wing airliner. And in fact, the access, the speed and distance from even a center aisle position in the center section of seats to the nearest exit is actually quicker or as quick as it is with any regular tube and wing. The loading effect on the circular fuselage argument, JetZero thinks it has basically enough composite knowledge now to overcome those earlier issues with squared off cabin sections. They looked at the design interior of this.

And the interesting thing about it is, yes, there is volume in there, but they think they can use it all. Even for example, if it evolves to a hydrogen economy in the future, there's plenty of room in there for liquid hydrogen tanks in the future. And scaling, that's maybe not something you'd have to worry about if they were aiming initially at this mid-market sector. But you're right, everybody has to consider what to do with the family. And Mark Page, who was principal designer at JetZero and one of the people who worked with Bob Liebeck for years, who came up with this T section way of being able to, you basically put an inverted T which forms the core of each of these models, and you can scale up around it, shrink it, or stretch it without affecting the overall configuration.

And my last point, sorry to go on, is that one of the initiatives that Mark's come up with is this pivot gear design. And this is really a key part of the concept. It enables the whole body to be tilted six degrees or thereabouts, so the body angle contributes to the lift, which means that you don't have a lot of the pitch control issues that a lot of these larger BWB concepts have had in the past. That's going to be an important design change in this.

Joe Anselmo:

Steve, our listeners can't see your face, but I can, and you looked a little skeptical there.

Steve Trimble:

Well, skeptical but impressed. I'm glad that they're addressing some of the... I'm sure they're aware of those issues and it sounds like they've got some pretty ingenious and clever ways of dealing with it. Like I said, I mean, I do think that there's definite interest and it's an easier path for them on the military side for a lot of reasons. But of course, the military itself may not actually have the financing in capitalized ability to pull this off on its own.

In fact, when they came out with their RFP for companies to submit to build this X-plane that they want to build in the next few years at this scale, they said that we want a company that can show us a business plan to make an airliner out of this so that they can defray and offset some of the costs so that the Air Force doesn't have to pay for the whole thing. So they will have to address these issues almost simultaneously, these efficiency issues and performance issues that they have to address in order to make it competitive in the airliner space.

And then of course, it's what Richard was talking about, just the financing and leverage advantage, the scale advantage that Airbus and Boeing can bring to the table if they so decide is hard for anybody to overcome, even with the backing of the Air Force, given that the Air Force order, it will only ever be 15 aircraft per year at the most. I mean. Well, maybe more, but it's hard to imagine that at this point.

So that's what they're up against. I really wish them well. It'd be great to see it happen. I've covered this for many years. I was there when Boeing delivered the pultruded rod stitch efficient unitized structure or PRESEUS that they tried to solve a lot of these structural loading problems under a NASA contract back in 2012 or so. And I hope that they figured it out. But it is a big challenge.

Guy Norris:

And just mentioning NASA, of course, I must point out that they were pretty keen on, they've got the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator Program, which they awarded to Boeing with the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing, which is another great efficient design that's been hatched for the future. But they were sufficiently keen on the JetZero concept to award them an initial subscale flight demonstrator contract. And that is being built as we speak. Or in fact, it's been built and it's about to go up to the desert to begin flying later this year. So, it's not to say that NASA themselves weren't encouraged by what they were seeing with this new concept, particularly the pivot gear that I was just mentioning.

And people will say, ""Well, hang on a minute. Why is NASA, if it is that interested, why didn't it award JetZero the contract for the full up aircraft? Or why did it go to Transonic Truss-Braced Wing?"" Well, of course, that is a different sector of the market. The TTBW will really address the replacement single aisle market for the future, whereas it doesn't at the moment anyway, scale up to anything much larger than a 75. So you're in that gray area, but essentially two different markets.

Joe Anselmo:

And what's the timetable? When is the Air Force going to make this award for the tanker?

Steve Trimble:

Well, so there's a process that they're still unfolding. Now the plan is to start with this X-plane, which they talked about being a full-scale X-plane and actually to have it fly by the end of 2026, or fiscal 2026, which I think seems very ambitious and aggressive even for an X-plane. But perhaps that they can make that work. A lot of it depends on how much funding they can get from Congress in fiscal 2024, assuming they can get any funding at all out of this Congress this year, because that could delay things as well.

Based on that, they want to be able to get this product, if this is the way they go for next generation tanker and airlifter, they want this to be the follow on to the KC-46 or whatever comes out of the bridge tanker concept. That's a whole other story about where that's going. So in the mid 2030s, late 2030s, they want to have this, whatever that is, be available to be that next tanker. And they want it to be more stealthy, which a flying wing can help them accomplish as well. So that's the general plan, but it depends on several factors that are not even all in the Air Force's control.

Joe Anselmo:

We will continue to stay on top of this story, obviously. Steve Trimble, thanks for your insights. Guy, congratulations on your scoop. Always great to have you. And Richard, thanks for taking the time to join us. We always love having you on as well.

El Al Mulls Airbus Order as Q1 2023 Results Announced - Airways Magazine,"Thu, 25 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZWwtYWwtYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVyLXExLTIwMjMtcmVzdWx0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – The national carrier of Israel El Al (LY) has revealed its 2023 first quarter (Q1) financial results, narrowing its net losses to $34m compared to a loss of $66m for the same quarter last year.

Overall operating profit came in at $9m compared with an operating loss of $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. Revenues increased to $500m, up from $283m in 2022. It marked the first time since 2019 that revenues had risen for Q1.

The airline also enjoyed rising load factors, up to 85% for the three months from January to March. Indeed, the airline is now operating at 93% of its pre-crisis levels. Like most carriers, however, its operating expenses have swelled, totalling $491.5m, with fuel accounting for 27%.

Fleet News

In its financial report, the Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport (TLV) based carrier said it was also planning to expand its fleet from 45 to 60 by 2028. It has requested proposals from its long-time aircraft partner Boeing and European plane maker Airbus to upgrade its single-aisle fleet.

Currently, the airline’s short-haul fleet comprises the Boeing 737, of which it has 24 in service with a mix of -800s and -900ERs. According to the statement, the airline is now “examining the proposals it received.”

On the long-haul front, El Al expects to receive its last Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner from its original order during the third quarter of this year after signing a financial agreement for the jet. A second 787 will also arrive next year.

It also hinted that it could further increase its Dreamliner fleet to 22 by 2028. This would allow it to add new routes to Australia, the Philippines and additional US cities, for which it is currently in discussions with the relevant authorities.

A220 Engine Woes Continue as More Operators Forced to Ground Airframes - Airways Magazine,"Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYTIyMC1lbmdpbmUtd29lcy1ncm91bmRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – Ongoing supply chain issues continue to cause a headache for operators of the Airbus A220. Several airlines have been forced to ground the type due to problems with its Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) PW1500G engines.

Many operators have encountered problems, while P&W deal with turnaround time delays as they attempt to resolve the issues and have struggled to source replacements.

Swiss Issues

Lufthansa Group member Swiss Air Lines (LX) is the latest carrier to reveal a problem, with one-third of its A220 fleet now grounded. The airline has leased six A220-300s from Air Baltic (BT) to cover the slack. LX currently operates 30 examples, including the -100 and larger -300 series.

This is not the first time LX has encountered issues with its A220s. The carrier grounded its entire fleet in 2019 after one of its -300s experience engine problems mid-flight.

Four separate inflight engine shutdowns also led the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue airworthiness directives to A220 operators in 2019 and 2020.

On May 4, it was revealed that Iraqi Airways (IA) had been ordered to ground its entire A220-300 fleet by the Iraq Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA). The airline currently has four of the type in service.

Latvian flag carrier Air Baltic (BT), whose fleet is made up entirely of the A220, was forced to temporarily wet-lease additional aircraft (four Avion Express (X9) Airbus A320s) between March 27 and May 31, 2023, due to almost a dozen of its -300s being grounded.

In a statement, Martin Gauss, BT President and CEO said that “the extended turnaround times for Pratt & Whitney servicing the engines are causing operational disruption for airBaltic. They, as a long-term partner of airBaltic, could not keep the given promise again on the improved turnaround times. Therefore, airBaltic is contracting replacement capacity in the form of ACMI wet-lease aircraft.”

African Airlines

Meanwhile, Air Tanzania (TC) has been grappling with issues with its A220 fleet since November, when it was forced to operate a reduced schedule due to the grounding of three out of its four -300 examples. At the time, Air Tanzania CEO Ladislaus Matindi said, “The PW1524G-3 engines made by Pratt & Whitney for A220-300 planes are supposed to be removed for maintenance after 5,260 landings, but due to engine design defects, they are removed before even 1,000 landings.”

Air Senegal (HC), who became the fourth African operator of the A220 in January 2022, quickly began to look for a replacement for the type after engine issues led it to cancel the lease of five further airframes due to arrive from Macquarie AirFinance.

In March, the two carriers joined forces to consider joint action against the engine maker. Managers from both airlines met to discuss the best source of action moving forward to find a solution to the persistent engine issues.

State-owned flag carrier Egyptair (MS) has also grounded seven of its 12 A220s for the same reason.

Other GTF Engine Issues

GTF engine issues are also causing a headache for Airbus A320 family operators. Lufthansa (LH) has been forced to ground three newly delivered A320neos.

Indian low-cost carrier Go First (G8) recently suspended operations and declared bankruptcy, citing issues with its A320neo family aircraft’s GTF engines as the primary reason for the grounding.

These engine problems come as the global airline industry ramps up for what is set to be a bumper summer season. P&W has said it is working hard to resolve the issues and hopes that the industry-wide supply chain issues will subside later this year.

The LAX-PIT route will be year-round and commence on Sept. 8. It will be flown 2X-weekly with Breeze's Airbus A220-300 aircraft.

LAX will be the 11th airport served by Breeze from PIT. Spirit Airlines currently operates daily flights between the western Pennsylvania airport and LAX, according to PIT.

Breeze started flying 2X-weekly from PIT to Orange County John Wayne Airport in southern California on a seasonal basis on March 31. That service will continue through Sept. 4 and is “expected to return in 2024,” again on a seasonal basis, PIT says.

News of the LAX-PIT route came as Breeze on May 25 launched 2X-weekly service between Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU) in North Carolina. American Airlines operates 2X-daily flights on the PIT-RDU route. Breeze also resumed seasonal service to Norfolk International Airport in Virginia.

From May 26, Breeze will open 2X-weekly service from PIT to both Long Island MacArthur Airport (ISP) in New York and Jacksonville International Airport (JAX) in Florida. According to PIT, Breeze will be the first airline to serve ISP from the airport in more than 25 years. Breeze will compete with Allegiant Air on the PIT-JAX route.

Breeze also will begin 2X-weekly service between PIT and Portland International Jetport (PWM) in Maine from June 2, giving PIT a connection to PWM for the first time since United Airlines dropped the route following the 2021 summer.

Breeze was launched in 2021 by Azul Brazilian Airlines and JetBlue Airways founder David Neeleman.

Speaking recently in Munich, Thellmann said, “Our objective is to fly passengers in a safe and emission-free aircraft from Munich Airport to the Ingolstadt area, about 65 km away.”

While aloft, the aircraft will use Europe’s new and improved unmanned traffic management services, i.e. U-Space. It will then land automatically at a connected vertiport.

The initiative comprises three main research modules. “First, there is the aircraft itself,” Thellmann said. “We are using the CityAirbus NextGen, our new flagship eVTOL [electric vertical take-off and landing] vehicle, which essentially unites the strengths of our two previous eVTOL configurations. There have been a number of new technologies required for this, specifically for the electrification of the propulsion system, as well as the capacity for highly automated operation, up to fully autonomous flight movements, EASA Level 3. And there are also certification aspects of eVTOL that we have been developing together with stakeholders.”

More to it

The second module concerns the airside infrastructure, the U-Space element. “Today’s airspace is segregated,” said Thellmann. “U-space will integrate it, overseeing and controlling all sorts of aircraft, smaller and larger ones, for passengers and goods. It’s a new philosophy, and it’s a big, big topic this year [2023] in Europe. U-Space is an essential building block for the certification of eVTOL in the corresponding airspace. We can see it just starting to be implemented in national laws, but there’s a long way to go. Germany got underway with U-Space on the first of January with the Federal Transport Ministry.”

The third key module for Airbus AMI is the ground infrastructure, the so-called vertiports. “The start-up of air mobility in urban and regional areas requires detailed investigations of this aspect,” Thellmann said. “You are going to need enough landing sites. The vertiports will have to be integrated into existing airports, like Munich airport, and also into city environments. But this is more complicated than it seems. To know how to integrate these vertiports in cities, you have to understand the traffic flows. You have to understand how the city is laid out. There are cities like Paris with dense centers and there are others cities with multiple centers. There are questions of geography to understand. All these vertiports will need to be constructed and certified, so we need to involve EASA and other national safety agencies.”

The complete AMI solution, including the CityAirbus NextGen, U-Space services and the connected vertiport will be tested under realistic conditions at the expanded Airbus Drone Innovation Center in Manching. AMI brings together 30 partners working on 10 distinct sub-projects. “We’ve said we want to do this within ten years, and the project started last year [2022],” said Thellmann, “so our target is 2032.” For now, the initiative is funded through 2025, to the tune of 125 million Euros.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999744892120361}",neutral,0.9999744892120361,0
Mayo Clinic adds new Airbus H145-D3 to Minn. fleet - EMS1.com,"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtczEuY29tL2Fpci1tZWRpY2FsLXRyYW5zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYXlvLWNsaW5pYy1hZGRzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtaDE0NS1kMy10by1taW5uLWZsZWV0LWFvUkVOSHJ3cWkzUGlCZW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Brian Arola

The Free Press

MANKATO, Minn. — Mayo Clinic Ambulance Service recently debuted a new medical helicopter stationed in Mankato.

Mankato is Mayo’s first site to utilize the H145-D3 model copter, two generations newer than what it previously had.

Crews began using the new aircraft on May 25 out of its Mankato Regional Airport hangar. As of Monday, it had transported 11 patients.

The latest, higher-powered model has updated safety and rotor systems and can handle more weight on emergency calls, said chief pilot Pat Hammann.

“We’re able to basically take the entire crew, all their equipment, the patient and still have a full tank of gas,” he said. “That was something that we haven’t had.”

The older model’s lower weight thresholds meant copters could only carry so much fuel at a time. More fuel on board can improve response times, said pilot Kai Schutte.

“Now we can have more fuel on board the aircraft and know we can still go over to a hospital, pick up, and go on a longer flight where we don’t need to refuel,” he said.

https://www.facebook.com/MayoClinicAmbulanceService/photos/a.178053389698980/1424986998338940/

Schutte and Hammann are two of the five Mayo Clinic Ambulance Service helicopter pilots in Mankato. The total crew also includes four paramedics and seven nurses.

A typical emergency response involves one pilot, nurse and paramedic on board. Most transports they do are from one hospital to another, with a Mankato to Rochester flight taking about 35 minutes.

Crews work 12-hour shifts out of the hangar, which has a kitchen, living room and sleeping quarters on site. Once an emergency call comes in, they go through a safety protocol before lifting off.

After an adjustment period to the new equipment, Schutte said, the team was getting off the ground in short order during the aircraft’s inaugural weekend. Schutte and crew had a five-transport shift over the weekend.

“By the end of the shift we were down to about that 10-minute range, which is what we’re looking for,” he said.

In some cases, the helicopter crew needs to fly to a crash site or land near a home to bring a stroke or heart attack patient to a hospital. A patient’s needs would determine whether a helicopter or ground transport is best suited to get them to an emergency room.

Hammann, Schutte, paramedic Andrea Forster and nurse Heather Hilke showcased the helicopter’s new capabilities Tuesday before Schutte and Forster hopped in for a demonstration flight from the airport to the hospital. The hospital’s ongoing construction project includes a new helipad.

As a pilot, Schutte said the new autopilot system is one of the more noticeable improvements on the new aircraft. Once engaged, the system allows the pilot to focus on other safety considerations, while cameras in the back, another new feature, enable viewing of the crew loading a patient on board once on the ground.

The new helicopter is also higher-powered, Hammann said, improving safety when navigating through difficult weather conditions.

“The engines produce about 23% more power than we had previously,” he said.

The £116 million government-funded NSTF, operated by experts from the STFC RAL Space (Science and Technology Facilities Council), will carry out the SKYNET 6A test campaign, including electromagnetic compatibility, as well as acoustic and thermal vacuum testing, to replicate the harsh conditions of space.

Richard Franklin, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK, said: “SKYNET 6A is designed and manufactured at our Stevenage and Portsmouth sites and will undergo its entire testing campaign at the new National Satellite Test Facility. It is fitting that the facility’s first testing contract is for Britain’s’ next generation SKYNET 6A, which will provide critical, secure-communications capability for our armed forces and will help further extend the UK’s space ecosystem and capability.”

Ian Annett, Deputy CEO at the UK Space Agency, said: “The National Satellite Test Facility is a significant addition to the UK’s growing space infrastructure that will improve the support available for companies across the breadth of the UK space industry, which employ thousands of people across the country. The brand new facility, the first customer of which will be Airbus Defence and Space, will also help attract new businesses of all shapes and sizes to Harwell and the UK. This will catalyse investment and accelerate the development of new technologies for decades to come – from advanced satellite manufacturing to secure communications, navigation and Earth observation.”

SKYNET 6A will be the first SKYNET milsatcom satellite to be entirely designed, built and tested in the UK. The programme involves a 500-strong team at Airbus and is being supported by more than 45 SMEs across the UK. This geostationary telecommunications satellite will provide secure communications services for the UK’s armed forces around the world following its launch in 2025.

Most of the work zones were not directly visible from the spot where company executives and elected officials spoke, and where a few dozen employees gathered to celebrate the production of the 100th Alabama-built A320-family jetliner to Delta. But the plentiful evidence that Airbus is building for boom times certainly helped set the mood.

“I’m starting to get really comfortable in Alabama,” said Jeff Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas. “I may have to move here. I just read in the Wall Street Journal that this is the place to be.” (That paper recently reported that coastal Alabama’s lower cost of living was tempting people to move there from Florida.)

“Preach it,” responded U.S. Rep. Jerry Carl, who along with Sen. Katie Britt was among those present.

Delta flies more than 400 Airbus aircraft, said Heather Wingate, senior VP of government relations for Delta. If you count a few A220-class jets, which Airbus also assembles in Mobile, more than a quarter of them were manufactured in Mobile.

More are coming. Airbus executives confirmed about a year ago that they planned to build a third Final Assembly Line in Mobile. The new line, like the first, will produce A320-family jets. Demand is high for the single-aisle, twin-engine jet and Airbus aims to ramp up production to unprecedented levels to capitalize. It’s also adding a second line to its A320 FAL in China.

“When you look back on where we were 5-10 years ago, I don’t think anyone could have imagined what we are doing here,” said Knittel. “Where we are today in Mobile? I’ve talked about the growth, but it’s not just growth in facilities, it’s growth in employees. We’ve gone from 50, 100 employees, this site now has 1,600 employees and we’ll have well over 2,000 very soon.”

In comments to reporters after the ceremony, Knittel said he anticipates the addition of 300 or 400 employees “in the coming year” and the eventual addition of 1,000 “over time.”

As might be expected, the occasion was a love-fest between Delta, Airbus and local officials. Knittel said of the latter group that the Mobile site’s growth has “really been a function of a great cooperation, federal, state and local. And quite honestly, in my experience, I have never seen a more aligned, and more importantly helpful, group. It’s not often you get saying what can we do to help. And that happens with this group.”

Knittel said to Delta, “You’re such an amazing partner for us.”

“It’s a very proud moment,” said Wingate. “We hold deep appreciation for our partnership with Airbus.”

Many singled out the Airbus workforce in Mobile.

“I got to walk through and watch you all a couple of months ago and I was blown away,” said Britt.

Carl said that Mobile’s workforce was becoming a selling point for the city. “We sell you every day, in my position,” he said. “We’re talking to other companies, we’re talking about your family, we’re talking about your commitment. We’re talking about our culture. We talk about you, the employees of Airbus and all the workforce in Mobile, because we’re family.”

He told the workers present that they were part of a David and Goliath story, presenting Boeing as the Goliath whose partisans scoffed at the idea of building jets in Mobile. “You’re David. You got the rock,” he said. “Goliath has got a sore chin right now, and we’re just getting started with Goliath. We just got him knocked off his feet a little bit, we’re going to finish him out.”

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson tossed out the possibility that after the expanded facilities begin operation in 2025, Mobile could be churning out 20 jetliners a month. Knittel said that it’s possible, through Airbus’ planning includes some “cushion.”

Within a few years, Knittel said, the Mobile campus will be capable of producing four A220s per month, plus up to eight A320s on the older line plus up to eight more on the new line.

“We are adding capacity around the world to meet the demands of the markets. And as you know the U.S. market is a growing market, and that’s why Mobile is so critical to the future,” Knittel said. “That doesn’t mean we’ll max out the lines. It’s a question of global demand. We’re building in cushion to ensure that we have the ability to meet more customers’ needs. So we’ll see how many airplanes we actually produce. Building production capability is different than actually producing the number of airplanes.”

Knittel cited FlightWorks, the museum and training center built in a partnership between Airbus and the state, as an asset.

“We are educating young people today for the future of aviation and, to be honest, other industries,” Knittel said. “Other states are asking us if they can copy it.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9976611137390137}",neutral,0.9976611137390137,0

Airbus Vows Faster Year-End Deliveries After Slack First Quarter - SupplyChainBrain,"Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM3MTc1LWFpcmJ1cy12b3dzLWZhc3Rlci15ZWFyLWVuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWFmdGVyLXNsYWNrLWZpcnN0LXF1YXJ0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE vowed to turn around its slow pace of aircraft deliveries in the second half of 2023 after lackluster output weighed on profit and sales in the first quarter.

The world’s biggest commercial aircraft manufacturer said the final four months of 2023 would be stronger, as Airbus follows its typical pattern of churning out a much higher number of jets in the final stretch. Speaking on a call with journalists after reporting earnings, chief executive officer Guillaume Faury reiterated his goal to hand over 720 units in 2023, while cautioning that the pace of deliveries would be “significantly” lower in the first half of 2023 than the second.

Airbus has warned of persistent issues with its supply chain that have created “challenges to roll the ball forward at the speed we want,” according to Faury. Besides a lack of skilled labor and parts, the company has also been forced to grapple with glitches on some of its most advanced aircraft engines, including the Pratt & Whitney units that power the A320 and smaller A220 single-aisle jets.

Faury said Airbus is “very closely monitoring” the issues on Pratt’s Geared Turbo Fan unit. Deutsche Lufthansa AG said May 3 that a third of its A220 fleet in Zurich is grounded because of engine issues. That’s adding to a growing chorus of carriers complaining of bigger-than-usual outages on their fleets just as the airline industry gears up for a bumper summer.

Airbus earlier reported a drop in first-quarter profit and sales amid the supply issues. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes fell to €773 million ($854 million) from €1.26 billion in the first three months of 2022, Airbus said in a statement. Sales dipped to €11.8 billion from €12 billion.

The company stood by its full-year targets for cash flow and aircraft deliveries, while pushing back the entry into service date of its A350 freighter version into 2026, which Faury said amounts to “a few months.”

Supplier Woes

Airbus has struggled to meet soaring demand for aircraft as travel rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic. Suppliers contending with the residual impact of the global health crisis are still short of workers and can’t meet demand for components ranging from seats to semiconductors to raw materials. That’s sapped profit and cash flows because Airbus recognizes revenue only when a plane is delivered.

“We continue to face an adverse operating environment that includes, in particular, persistent tensions in the supply chain,” Faury said in the statement. “We remain focused on delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up and longer-term transformation.”

Foreign-exchange movements also squeezed profit. Airbus receives revenue in dollars, which have been falling in value against the euro, the currency that makes up the bulk of its expenses. Airbus said it had taken a charge of €360 million related to a mismatch in pre-delivery payments in dollars and a revaluation of its balance sheet.

The company had negative free cash flow of about €889 million, compared with positive free cash flow of €213 million in 2023, which it attributed to inventory build-up as it prepares to ramp up production.

April Shipments

Shipments totaled 127 planes in the first quarter of 2023, a 9% drop from Q1 2022, leaving Airbus to lag behind Boeing Co. for the first time in almost five years. Bloomberg reported earlier on May 3 that Airbus deliveries fell to about 55 jets in April 2023 from March 2023. The company didn’t provide a figure for its April 2023 deliveries in the earnings release.

The supply constraints could last until the end of 2024 or even into 2025, putting pressure on the plane maker’s ambitious production ramp-up of its best-selling A320neo family to 75 a month by 2026.

In January 2023, Toulouse, France-based Airbus forecast an approximately 7% increase in adjusted earnings before interest and tax to €6 billion for all of 2023. It expects free cash flow before some items to drop to €3 billion from €4.7 billion.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9774282574653625}",negative,0.9774282574653625,-1

The Lufthansa Group has received more Airbus aircraft than any other customer worldwide, it has been the launch customer for Airbus aircraft four times, and it is the third-biggest A350 customer. A special livery for the milestone A321neo was unveiled today at the delivery ceremony at the Hamburg-Finkenwerder site.

On February 9, 1976, LH received its first Airbus A300B2, laying the groundwork for a long-lasting partnership in European civil aviation that has now lasted almost 50 years. Since then, more than ten different Airbus aircraft types have been supplied to nearly every air operator in the Lufthansa Group.

History of Lufthansa-Airbus

Lufthansa signed its first purchase agreement with Airbus for three A300B2s in 1975 and received its first such aircraft from Europe’s new manufacturer seven months later on February 9, 1976. Subsequent years saw the first deliveries of further Airbus types: the A310 in 1983, followed by the A300-600 in 1987.

The first Airbus A320 to join the LH fleet was delivered in October 1989. Over 370 aircraft of the A320 family are in service today with the various airlines of the LH Group. The first A340 followed in 1993, and just one year later the LH Airbus fleet passed the 100-aircraft mark. The A330 followed in 2004, and in 2010 the A380 joined the airline’s long-haul fleet.

Lufthansa has also served as the launch customer for the A310, the A340, the A220, and the A320neo. While the Airbus A320 family is a cornerstone of today’s LH fleet, the A350-900, which first arrived in 2016, has also become a key component in the German carrier’s long-haul fleet.

600th Airbus named ‘Münster’

The 600th Airbus aircraft to be delivered to Lufthansa, which bears the registration D-AIEQ, is an Airbus A321neo. Seating 215 passengers, the A321neo is a state-of-the-art and fuel-efficient short- and medium-haul twinjet that has been in Lufthansa service since 2019. D-AIEQ has been named ‘Münster’ after the German city.

Comments from Lufthansa, Airbus Officials

Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Lufthansa Group Executive Board: “Lufthansa and Airbus are united by a very special partnership. Ever since Airbus’s creation, we have enjoyed close and trusting collaborations on a wide range of research projects and new developments. Lufthansa has also served no fewer than four times as Airbus’s launching customer for a new aircraft type, most recently for the A320neo family that is proving such a success.

The LH Chairman added, “Lufthansa has ordered every family of aircraft that Airbus has developed over the past five decades. And more than 90 percent of the 600 Airbuses that we have taken delivery of during that time are still in Lufthansa Group service today. We also wish to welcome our 700th Airbus to our fleet as part of Lufthansa’s centennial celebrations in 2026.”

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, “Lufthansa and Airbus have been partners ever since we delivered the first Lufthansa A300 back in February 1976. Since then, Lufthansa has taken delivery of an Airbus aircraft an average of every month – 600 of them in almost 50 years! No other airline group has received more of our aircraft to date.

The CEO ended by thanking on behalf of the company “all the teams at Lufthansa for all their confidence and trust. We look forward to the next 50 years of our partnership and our shared commitment to the goal of sustainable air travel.”

Airbus Unveils Its Airspace Cabin Vision 2035+ – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpcnNwYWNlLWNhYmluLXZpc2lvbi0yMDM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS — In the lead-up to Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX), Airbus unveiled its Airspace Cabin Vision 2035+ today at its Toulouse, France headquarters.

The French airframer brought together ten airlines and eight technology companies to contribute to a vision that rethinks how the cabin should look and feel while maintaining superior passenger comfort.

Decarbonization

Airbus states that at the core of the new cabin designs is decarbonization. Currently, research indicates that the cabin can contribute 10-20% of the aircraft’s overall environmental impact during its lifecycle. Airbus says that lightweight solutions are one of the most powerful emissions-cutting levers in the cabin.

Lighter, bionic designs will help reduce cabin weight by up to 40%, and new catering concepts such as pre-ordering your meal on long-haul flights or picking up your snack at the boarding gate on short-haul flights will help reduce food waste and weight by up to 15%.

Airbus’ lightweight designs incorporate bionic principles and 3D printing technologies. The company intends to reduce the number of cabin materials used and to concentrate on less carbon-intensive solutions than those currently in use, such as biobased fabrics and recycled polymers.

Furthermore, smart system design will optimize energy consumption and resource utilization.

Circularity

Another key component of Airbus’ new cabin design proposal is the concept of circularity. As the world transitions to a more circular economy, enabled by End-to-End digitalized data transparency, Airbus says it’s rethinking the materials used inside the cabin so that they can be recycled, reused, and repaired throughout their lifecycle.

Airbus’ plan is for its engineers and designers to be able to develop the best solutions for the entire product life cycle using digital tools. All cabin elements, such as galleys, seats, and lining, will be managed and eventually recycled thanks to traceability.

“Rethink, recycle, repair, and reuse” are Airbus’ guiding principles for its cabin design approach going forward.

When Will We Start Seeing the New Cabin Changes?

Airbus says that its smart processes, lightweight design, and circular approach will all contribute toward clean aerospace by the end of the year.

Cabin lining and components will be developed for current aircraft using new materials, and full implementation will begin with the next-generation aircraft.

The A330neo will join the ITA Airways fleet in June to serve its long-haul routes and new intercontinental destinations.

The A330neo is the latest-generation aircraft type from Airbus to join the ITA Airways’ fleet. The airline already operates all Airbus aircraft Families with a fleet of 68 Airbus aircraft (4 A220s, 50 A320 Family, 8 A330-200s and 6 A350-900s). By selecting A330neos, ITA Airways is further consolidating its strategy of being an all Airbus operator and leveraging new levels of efficiency and flexibility.

With the introduction of the latest generation eco-efficient A330neo, ITA Airways continues its fleet modernisation to meet its ambitious sustainability targets. To further support this ambition the delivery flight will be powered by a 16% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The A330neo delivers unbeatable operating economics and boasts an award-winning Airspace cabin with more passenger space, a new lighting system, the latest in-flight entertainment systems and full connectivity throughout the cabin.

ITA Airways’s A330neo named Gelindo Bordin, to commemorate the Italian Olympic marathon champion, will feature a three-class cabin layout designed by renowned designer Walter De Silva. It’ll feature 30 full lie-flat bed business class seats, 24 premium and 237 latest generation economy class seats of which, 36 are dedicated to comfort economy.

The aerospace giant presented its next-gen aircraft cabin during a virtual media briefing. Developed in partnership with 10 airlines and eight technology firms, Airspace is at the bleeding edge of aeronautical design and will shape how the company creates jet interiors from 2035 onwards.

More from Robb Report

The company says the concept is built on three pillars: transparency, decarbonization, and circularity. That’s a fancy way of saying the cabin is eco-friendly and will help offset each plane’s carbon footprint. Of course, Airbus says fliers can expect more personalized service, better seats, additional smart devices, and an “enhanced atmosphere.” The enhancements, it appears, will include a see-through ceiling that allows passengers to gaze up at the clouds or stars while flying—or soak in some natural light.

Airspace cabins will help to offset the plane’s carbon emissions.

In terms of transparency, passengers will be able to easily view the environmental impact of each flight via a mobile travel companion app, which will also offer options for ways to offset carbon emissions.

Speaking of decarbonization, Airbus claims the easiest way to cut emissions is to reduce the plane’s weight. To that end, the new cabins will feature a “bionic design” that will reportedly lower a plane’s weight by 40 percent. Part of this reduction comes from new catering and trolley concepts that would reduce the galley weight. Pre-ordering food on long-range flights could lower waste and weight by 15 percent, for instance.

Passengers will be able to see the environmental impact of each flight.

As for circularity, Airbus says it will rethink its cabin materials, opting for versions it can recycle, repair, and reuse.

So, when will Airspace take flight? Airbus will begin making changes to its existing cabin range this year, but will fully introduce the concept with its next generation of aircraft. The company says it will provide more information about the new cabins at the 2023 Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany next week. Stay tuned.
