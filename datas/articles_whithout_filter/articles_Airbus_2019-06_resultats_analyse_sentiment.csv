Airbus reaches new heights with the help of Microsoft mixed reality technology - Source - Microsoft,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL25ld3MubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9zb3VyY2UvZmVhdHVyZXMvZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi9haXJidXMtcmVhY2hlcy1uZXctaGVpZ2h0cy13aXRoLXRoZS1oZWxwLW9mLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1taXhlZC1yZWFsaXR5LXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It took Airbus 40 years to build its first 10,000 aircraft. Over the next 20 years, the aerospace giant aims to build 20,000 more—a formidable challenge that will require cutting-edge innovation.

Holographic technology from Microsoft, known as “mixed reality” because it combines physical and digital worlds, will be key to helping Airbus reach this ambitious goal.

“Our challenge in the coming years is to manufacture more aircraft faster, and for that we need to enable our workers to be much better equipped and to be much more effective in what they do. We need to raise the bar,” says Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president of engineering at Airbus, which manufactures aircraft, helicopters, satellites and launch vehicles.

“To face this challenge, we intend to make an intense use of mixed reality and that’s why we’ve partnered with Microsoft,” Dumont says.

Microsoft’s mixed reality technology can be used to help Airbus production workers access information and instructions while their hands are occupied, for example. It can also facilitate training without tying up expensive equipment or even requiring the trainee to travel to where the equipment is located. This is just the beginning: Airbus has identified more than 300 use cases for mixed reality.

Airbus has been exploring mixed reality for several years, and started working with Microsoft on mixed reality solutions four years ago. Those solutions will get a boost with the advanced capabilities of HoloLens 2, Microsoft’s latest-generation mixed reality headset, and a growing portfolio of mixed reality applications and services from Microsoft and industry partners.

What is mixed reality?

Mixed reality takes digital information beyond two-dimensional screens to a three-dimensional experience by using holograms, which are images made of light and sound.

Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is a culmination of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), hardware design and mixed reality development. It allows people to interact with holograms in physical space, meaning that they can view and manipulate holographic images on their own in the air or in combination with real physical objects.

The recent release of HoloLens 2 takes the mixed reality experience a step further, allowing users to manipulate holograms the same way they would handle physical objects. The headset also offers eye tracking that can sense when a user’s eyes land on a particular location and produce relevant digital information, as well as automatic scrolling as the user reads. Users can log in via iris recognition, making sharing among multiple people easy and secure.

Putting mixed reality to work

Airbus has seen impressive results in its trials and deployments of Microsoft’s mixed reality technology in training, design and manufacturing.

“Mixed reality can help us to increase quality, safety and security,” Dumont says. “The level of human error is significantly reduced, and in aerospace, increased quality is increased safety—and needless to say, security goes with that.”

Mixed reality allows aerospace trainees to learn in an immersive virtual environment without the need for an actual physical aircraft or parts. This 3D environment can offer features that real-life training cannot, such as the ability to view elements in three dimensions from any angle.

HoloLens helps Airbus designers virtually test their designs to see if they are ready for manufacture. Mixed reality speeds up the process substantially, decreasing the time spent by 80 percent.

Mixed reality technology can also help workers on the production line access crucial information while keeping their hands free. Digital information, such as instructions or diagrams, can be overlaid on a real piece of machinery to aid in complex or hard-to-reach tasks. These kinds of mixed-reality solutions have allowed Airbus to cut manufacturing time by a third while improving quality.

Mixed reality empowers employees to execute their jobs in the most efficient and ergonomic way possible, and this contributes directly to performance improvements, according to Barbara Bergmeier, who is head of operations at Airbus Defense and Space.

“By having the right information at the right time in hands free mode, not only does quality increase, but also safety, and this is what we are looking for. Quality without consideration of the well-being of our workers is not possible,” she says.

Working together to evolve mixed reality

Not only is Airbus creating solutions for its workforce, but it has built off-the-shelf solutions for its customers, so they can also benefit from Airbus’ expertise in building mixed reality solutions. Starting at the Paris Air Show, Airbus will be selling these in partnership with Microsoft on HoloLens 2.

“HoloLens 2 was born from the inspiration that it be designed for the customer, by the customer,” says Alex Kipman, technical fellow in Microsoft’s Cloud and AI group. “Airbus has long been a strategic partner in building the future of mixed reality solutions for an industrial environment and we have learned a lot from them. We are thrilled to continue our partnership as we embark on this next era of computing, the era of mixed reality and artificial intelligence.”

The first new solution offered under this partnership is a mixed reality training program first released with Japan Airlines (JAL). It helps maintenance operators and cabin crews learn in a 3D holographic environment and access instructions, heads-up and hands-free, while on the job.

In addition, Airbus will launch a collaborative map solution that allows participants from the defense and aerospace fields to virtually connect, quickly share space data and interact with complex virtual environments to plan and prepare ahead of missions.

Airbus is working on requests from other customers for mixed reality maintenance, training and remote collaboration solutions.

Leading in real life

Airbus’ collaboration with Microsoft on mixed reality goes beyond helping the company reach its internal goals. Such technological innovation is crucial to Airbus’ larger objective to become a world leader in digital services for the aerospace industry.

“We are very optimistic about this future collaboration with Microsoft based off what we’ve done in the last four years,” Dumont says. “This is really a way for us to lead our digital transformation. It’s multifold, but the use of mixed reality and HoloLens 2 are one of the key assets for Airbus in the future.”

"Boeing and Airbus made huge mistakes, but their dominance is under no threat - CNN","Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wNi8yNS9idXNpbmVzcy9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWR1b3BvbHkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTkvMDYvMjUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1kdW9wb2x5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN Business —

Boeing and Airbus dominate aviation like precious few duos dominate their industries. That’s why both plane makers will probably weather their recent multi-billion dollar mistakes.

Boeing’s problem is the tragedy of two fatal crashes involving its bestselling passenger jet, the 737 Max. It has led to a global grounding of the plane, a halt in deliveries, and so-far-untold billions of dollars in costs.

Airbus failed to read the market correctly. Earlier this year it pulled the plug on the A380 superjumbo, a two-deck aircraft it spent $25 billion to develop. Airbus sold less than quarter of the 1,200 planes it had originally expected to sell.

But the two companies’ combined dominance is a self-perpetuating fact of life.

A new competitor, if one should emerge, would have a difficult time taking significant market share from Airbus and Boeing. Costs are great for an upstart competitor to compete in one of the most capital-intensive industries in the world. And airlines can’t easily switch to a different airplane manufacturer once they invest in one company’s model, because of the increased cost of pilot training, maintenance and spare parts.

That means neither Boeing nor Airbus need to worry too much about missteps.

The two companies compete fiercely for orders. But even if an airline wanted to switch between one manufacturer and the other, it would have to wait years to get a plane from the rival manufacturer, because of a huge backlog in orders. So it’ll be difficult for either Boeing or Airbus to “lose” the market to the other.

And both companies have billions of dollars in cash on their balance sheets to ride out any problem. Failure is literally not an option.

“I don’t see any possibility for one of them to go under,” said Bijan Vasigh, an economics professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

Despite their problems, Airbus (EADSF)’ stock is up more 47% for the year. Boeing (BA) shares are up nearly 16%.

Why Boeing and Airbus’ dominance is here to stay

Part of the lack of competition is because of the huge capital expense required to develop and build a commercial plane, something that dwarfs the development cost in other fields.

“The barriers to entry are enormous in this market,” said Cai von Rumohr, aerospace analyst with Cowen. “This is a business where you have to have a lot of scale, a lot of cash.” He said that’s the reason why Bombardier and Embraer, which have made smaller planes used by regional airlines that provide feeder flights, sold some of their businesses to Airbus and Boeing.

Both Bombardier and Embraer developed slightly larger jets than their traditional small passenger planes. The Bombardier C Series jet and the Embraer E2 jet could have posed a challenge to the bread-and-butter single-aisle jets at the core of Boeing’s and Airbus’ business. But both ended up essentially selling control of their jet business rather than trying to compete head-to-head with the big boys.

There is one potential major competitor on the horizon.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, has a single-aisle plane, the C919, designed to challenge the A320 and 737 Max. China is forecast to be the largest market, by far, for new plane purchases. Boeing forecasts commercial plane purchases will total $3.1 trillion over the next decade, with 40% of those purchases going to the Asia Pacific region. That gives Comac an advantage that no other potential competitor enjoys.

As a state-run company, Comac could be well positioned to sell to the Chinese market. With its Made In China program, the Chinese government wants to support domestic manufacturing.

But the C919 is still months if not years away from being certified for passenger use. And it’s not clear how successful it will be.

Part of the doubt is that as a government-run company Comac, has strict rules on using Chinese suppliers, which could make the plane less competitive, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group.

“They have one of the biggest markets in the world, great resources, unlimited talent. The only thing they can do to fail is exactly what they’re doing,” said Aboulafia. “If they change the rules, they could be phenomenal.”

Just as with their western counterparts, Chinese airlines are already heavily invested in Boeing and Airbus planes. They would have the same trouble switching to a new supplier.

Aboulafia said that even when the Comac plane is ready, he doesn’t believe the Chinese government would require airlines there to stop purchasing from Boeing or Airbus.

“Whenever someone complains about the trade imbalance, the Chinese point to airplane purchases,” he said.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9770544171333313}",negative,0.9770544171333313,-1
"Pilotless planes? Airbus thinks public, regulators will warm to idea - USA TODAY","Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy8yMDE5LzA2LzE4L3BpbG90bGVzcy1wbGFuZXMtYWlyYnVzLXRoaW5rcy1wdWJsaWMtcmVndWxhdG9ycy13YXJtLWlkZWEvMTQ4NjIyMTAwMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Would you be willing to fly on a pilotless jet? Airbus bets the answer is yes – eventually

LE BOURGET, France – The chief salesman for Airbus says his company already has the technology to fly passenger planes without pilots at all – and is working on winning over regulators and travelers to the idea.

Christian Scherer also said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday that Airbus hopes to be selling hybrid or electric passenger jets by around 2035.

While the company is still far from ready to churn out battery-operated jumbo jets, Scherer said Airbus already has “the technology for autonomous flying” and for planes flown by just one pilot.

On autopilot: 'Pilots are losing their basic flying skills,' some fear after Boeing 737 Max crashes

“This is not a matter of technology – it’s a matter of interaction with the regulators, the perception in the traveling public,” he told The Associated Press.

“When can we introduce it in large commercial aircraft? That is a matter we are discussing with regulators and customers, but technology-wise, we don’t see a hurdle.”

Several manufacturers are presenting unmanned aircraft at the Paris Air Show, primarily for military purposes – and some are also proposing pilotless “air taxis” of the future.

When it comes to autonomous passenger jets, safety is an obvious concern. It’s an issue that is on many minds after two deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max jet that have implicated problematic anti-stall software.

Scherer said the crashes “highlighted and underlined the need for absolute, uncompromising safety in this industry, whether from Airbus, Boeing or any other plane.”

While he said Airbus’ sales strategy hasn’t changed as a result of the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, “there is a capacity need that materialized as a result of this, and naturally you have airlines that are frustrated over capacity, that are looking for answers.”

Airbus announced several orders Monday as the air show kicked off, while Boeing had an anemic day as it works to win back trust from customers.

Scherer forecast continued growth in the aviation industry after several boom years, predicting the world will need at least 37,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years, especially in Asia – and that eventually the whole industry will stop creating emissions and “decarbonize.”

Boeing is seeing lackluster contracts at the Paris Air Show so far as it tries to win back trust from customers after the crashes of two 737 Max jets.

The company announced a deal Monday to provide services and parts for British Airways via its owner International Airlines Group, and another to provide technology to help United Airlines set pilot schedules. Boeing also struck a deal for freighter jets with leasing company GECAS.

Asked whether the Max crashes affected its trust in Boeing, British Airways Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning said, “We’re confident that Boeing will solve those issues and will get these issues behind them.” His airline did not announce any new plane purchases from Boeing.

In contrast, rival Airbus announced a string of plane sales on the first day of the Paris Air Show worth several billion dollars.

Boeing’s CEO said the company came to the air show with a tone of humility after the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, which killed 346 people.

3:10 p.m.

Families of victims, regulators and airlines have mixed feelings about Boeing’s apology for 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people.

Ningsi Ayorbaba told The Associated Press: “I hope this is a good signal for the victims to have compensation rights that we have not yet received.”

Her husband Paul Ferdinand Ayorbaba died in the Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October. She is among dozens of families who have filed lawsuits against Boeing.

Indonesia’s transportation ministry said the government is still waiting for “transparent work of the aircraft maker to fix the problem” that led to the crashes. Investigations are underway.

An Ethiopian who lost her younger brother in an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March said Boeing’s apology is not enough, and expressed concern about Boeing’s push to re-certify the 737 Max.

Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said Boeing’s apology Monday at the Paris Air Show “is consistent with our opinion.”

12:20 p.m.

France, Germany and Spain have agreed to develop a joint European fighter jet and air combat system that could also control drones and satellites.

With a model of the jet as a backdrop, defense ministers from the three countries signed an agreement Monday at the Paris Air Show that lays out how the countries will cooperate on the project, which would include a new-generation combat aircraft. French President Emmanuel Macron presided over the signing.

The Future Combat Air System is expected to be operational by 2040.

France sees it as a key step in its push for more European defense efforts, given U.S. President Donald Trump’s apparent lack of enthusiasm for supporting Europe militarily.

Authorities have not said how much it would cost but the dpa news agency estimates it could be 100 billion euros ($112 billion).

11:25 a.m.

Airbus will start making a new single-aisle long-range jet, beating rival Boeing to the market in this category.

The European plane maker launched the A321XLR jet Monday at the Paris Air Show, saying it will be ready for customers in 2023 and will fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 kilometers).

Chief salesman Christian Scherer would not say how much the plane would cost to develop, but said it would be significantly less than building a whole new plane because it is an upgraded version of the existing A321.

It was the biggest new plane announcement expected at the Paris Air Show gathering of aviation industry powerhouses.

Boeing is considering whether to build a new jet — the concept is dubbed New Midsize Airplane, or NMA — that would be close in size to the A321XLR. It would fill a gap in the Boeing lineup between the smaller 737 and the larger 777 and 787.

Right after the launch, Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation signed a letter of intent to buy 27 of the new Airbus planes.

9:55 a.m.

A Boeing executive is apologizing to airlines and families of victims of 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.

Kevin McAllister, CEO of Boeing’s commercial aircraft, told reporters at the Paris Air Show on Monday that “we are very sorry for the loss of lives” in the Lion Air crash in October and Ethiopian Airlines crash in March. A total of 346 people were killed.

McAllister also said “I’m sorry for the disruption” to airlines from the subsequent grounding of all Max planes worldwide, and to their passengers. He stressed that the company is working hard to learn from what went wrong but wouldn’t say when the plane could fly again.

Other Boeing executives also stressed the company’s focus on safety and condolences to victims’ families.

Angle-measuring sensors in both planes malfunctioned, alerting anti-stall software to push the noses of the planes down. The pilots were unable to take back control of the planes. Investigations are underway.

9:45 a.m.

The world’s aviation elite are gathering at the Paris Air Show with safety concerns on many minds after two crashes of the popular Boeing 737 Max.

The global economic slowdown and trade tensions between the U.S. and other powers are also weighing on the event that opened Monday at Le Bourget airfield.

Boeing’s CEO said the company is heading into this week’s show with “humility” after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia and Boeing’s botched communication over a cockpit warning system in the Max.

Rival Airbus is expecting some big orders despite a slow sales year so far, and is likely to unveil its long-range A320 XLR at the Paris show.

The event also is showcasing electric planes, pilotless air taxis and other cutting-edge technology.

The deal for the A321XLR jetliners, announced at the Paris Air Show on Wednesday, makes the Fort Worth-based airline the first major U.S. carrier to agree to buy the longest-range narrowbody plane Airbus now offers. Under the agreement, American will convert 30 of its orders for the smaller Airbus A321neo in favor of the longer-range model, and order an 20 additional A321XLRs.

The planes could replace some older aircraft like Boeing 757s. The new planes are aimed at longer routes where there aren't enough travelers to support the expense of operating a larger twin-aisle jet.

American's endorsement of the new Airbus planes comes as Boeing is mulling an all-new double-aisle plane targeting mid-range routes. Analysts had expected Boeing to unveil the new offering at the Paris Air Show. But hopes faded as the Chicago-based company has been hobbled by the crisis left by two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which have been grounded since mid-March.

Boeing did win a surprise vote of confidence in the 737 Max during this year's air show with a 200-plane order from British Airways' parent International Consolidated Airlines Group, the first order for the beleaguered jets since they were grounded three months ago. IAG also ordered 14 Airbus XLR planes for its Iberia and Aer Lingus airlines.

Neither American Airlines nor Airbus would disclose the financial terms of the deal, but American Airlines president Robert Isom said the XLR will initially cost the airline more than the A321neo.

""My feeling is this aircraft certainly gives us much greater utility in the long run and at the end of the day will be worth quite bit more to us,"" Isom said in a video discussing the deal released by American Airlines.

The 321XLR is expected to open more routes between the U.S. and smaller, secondary cities in Europe. For example, American could fly it between Philadelphia and Basel, Switzerland. ""This opportunity, with the enhancements being made to the XLR are really cool,"" said Isom.

Since Airbus announced plans for the plane on Monday, the company has racked up eight orders for more than 160 XLRs. Air Lease Corporation, which leases hundreds of airplanes to airlines around the world, placed the initial order for 27 XLRs. Air Lease CEO John Plueger told CNBC the plane is ""a blockbuster.""

American is the first U.S.-based airline to order the newest Airbus plane, but Denver-based Frontier Airlines will also be flying the XLR shortly after deliveries begin in 2023. Frontier's parent company, private equity firm, Indigo Partners placed an order for 50 XLR planes, with initial plans to put 18 of them into Frontier's fleet, and the others in its stable of discount carriers in Latin America and Europe.

After the Paris Air Show in June 2011 American Airlines announced a massive 460-plane order that included both Boeing planes and Airbus jets, American's first order from the European manufacturer in more than 20 years. The Airbus order included 260 planes, half of them for the neo, or new-engine option that provided more fuel efficiency.

HPM: Airbus A220 assembly line project gaining momentum in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvaHBtLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLWFzc2VtYmx5LWxpbmUtcHJvamVjdC1nYWluaW5nLW1vbWVudHVtLWluLWFsYWJhbWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The facility now being built on the Mobile campus is also strategically significant as it will allow Airbus to produce a second aircraft type in Alabama — the single-aisle A220 passenger jet to meet the demands of U.S. airlines.

It’s also an extension of the partnership the Alabama firm has forged with Airbus.

“The relationship with Airbus has played an integral role in the growth of HPM, and we’re honored to expand our partnership on the new A220 assembly line,” said Ryan Austin, chief operations officer at HPM. “Through past projects, we have cultivated a mutual respect and keen understanding of the strategic processes and objectives for each organization.

“Those symmetries will enable us to deliver a top-caliber facility that will help Airbus to achieve its production goals and will ultimately contribute to increased growth and prosperity for the city of Mobile and state of Alabama,” he said.

RENEWED PARTNERSHIPS

Though the groundbreaking ceremony was staged just five months ago, HPM’s work on the project actually started in Spring 2018, when it began working on programming efforts with Airbus and its A220 partner, Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier, according to Ellis.

HPM then teamed with the engineering and development firm Mott MacDonald, a partner on the A320 project, to draw up a master plan and assemble the design build and construction teams for the new project.

HPM tapped Brasfield & Gorrie, which built the A320 assembly line, for the same role in the A220 project. Another Birmingham-based firm, BL Harbert International, is adding four additional hangar bays to support A220 and A320 production.

Both are moving forward for a fast-track delivery for Airbus, which aims to begin assembling A220 aircraft at the site this summer.

Ellis said BL Harbert has topped out the steel structures for the new bays and begun pouring slabs and enclosing the buildings. Brasfield & Gorrie is already into steel construction and prepping areas for an underground tunnel that will run within the assembly line.

“They’ve got all the foundation systems installed and all of the temporary shoring. They are closing in on about 50 percent completion with the building of the final assembly line,” Ellis said. “Over the next 60 days, we’ll start to install roof and exterior wall systems once they get the steel far enough along.”

A future phase of the project calls for an expansion of the delivery center on the Airbus campus, where more than 120 Alabama-made A320 Family aircraft have already been delivered to eight U.S.-based airline customers.

“This will be a nice enhancement to the facility there and will bring a little more prominence and ceremony to the delivery of aircraft in Mobile,” Ellis said.

Once the new facility is at full production, Airbus plans to build four A220 aircraft each month.

The company is hiring more than 400 new workers to staff the new assembly line and is also adding jobs to increase production of A320 Family aircraft in Alabama. Read a story on Airbus’ hiring plans.

MEETING GOALS

The A220 project’s accelerated timeline has prompted HPM to take a different approach than the one it used with the original assembly line.

“This is a bit more streamlined. We are designing while building, while we are prepping for equipment to be installed, so that as soon as things are tested and approved, we can begin working with the operations team to bring aircraft through the facility,” Ellis said.

Another challenge for HPM is that the heavy-duty construction work must be performed on the site of a major manufacturing facility.

“We cannot in any way, shape, form or fashion impact their ongoing operations. That is a unique challenge in and of itself,” he said.

‘LAUNCHING PAD’

Since completing the A320 assembly line project for Airbus, HPM has been involved in several large-scale aerospace and aviation projects, including Aerojet Rocketdyne’s new advanced manufacturing facility in Huntsville, and expansion projects for MRO companies VT MAE and HAECO America.

Earlier this year, HPM was selected to help Boom Aviation locate, design and build a manufacturing facility for its planned supersonic airliner. Two years ago, HPM began its work alongside the properties and facilities teams of FedEx Express throughout the U.S. managing airport and runway projects, enhancing sorting facilities and renovating offices.

“The A320 project was really our launching pad into aerospace and aviation,” Ellis said.

Since then, HPM has also worked with global manufacturers such as Continental Tire and Mercedes-Benz, which is adding a second campus to its industrial footprint in Alabama.

“When you work for an international client the size and magnitude of Airbus, and you satisfy and please them, the rest of the world stands up and takes notice,” Ellis said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9665044546127319}",neutral,0.9665044546127319,0

"Airbus touts left-hook, right-hook MoM approach but Paris plan unclear - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXRvdXRzLWxlZnQtaG9vay1yaWdodC1ob29rLW1vbS1hcHByb2FjaC1idXQtcGFyaXMtcGxhbi11bmNsZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The middle of the market finds itself in an unprecedented kind of hot stasis. The Paris Air Show — where nine or even four months ago, Boeing was expected to go full speed ahead and launch its NMA, the aircraft with which it intends to counter Airbus in the middle of the market — is less than two weeks away. Airbus has dominated the MoM with its A321neo, but during its recent Innovation Days media event outside Toulouse, Airbus’ plans for Le Bourget remained rather undisclosed.

The airframer seems to feel no pressure to make the next move given Boeing’s focus on getting the grounded 737 MAX safely back in the air, after crashes killing hundreds of people raised fundamental questions about its capacity to safely engineer aircraft, the FAA’s oversight of aircraft and system certification, and indeed what the full impact will be on suppliers, including suppliers of seats, overhead bins, lavatories, IFE, IFC, lighting, etc. For its part, Boeing has indicated it still intends to decide this year whether to offer its NMA, according to a report by Flightglobal.

Adding to Boeing’s credibility problems, the US airframer’s latest cleansheet program, the 787, has seen its Charleston Dreamliner production head depart following what the New York Times describes as “shoddy production practices and weak oversight at the factory”. Separately, Boeing has informed the FAA that certain 737NG and 737 MAX leading edge slat tracks may have been improperly manufactured and may not meet all applicable regulatory requirements for strength and durability, the FAA said in a statement promising a forthcoming Airworthiness Directive.

Airbus loves to make big aircraft and order announcements at the Paris Air Show, where it has the home ground and can engage more French media in particular. Had Boeing launched the NMA, Airbus would have been expected to counter with further models in its A320neo re-engined narrowbody twinjet family — particularly to extend the capacity of the A321neo and its long-range model the A321LR. And had Airbus still been planning to do so, it would have been expected to signal strongly its intentions at the pre-Le Bourget briefing during its Innovation Days event.

Hands up: that’s a lot of conditional clauses. But Airbus’ response from chief commercial officer Christian Scherer — with later hints from new chief executive officer Guillaume Faury — is that the company will be further developing the somewhat unusual metaphor of the “rock and a hard place” of the company’s single- and twin-aisle aircraft, but isn’t yet willing to talk about the details.

“In the middle of the market, here again there isn’t a one-solution-fits-all recipe on this. What Airbus has in the middle of the market, which by far is most the competitive one — this is where the bulk of the airlines compete with each other, and for every market you have several airlines competing with each other — in this market space you want to have the most flexible economic solution for your customers,” Scherer said.

“Airbus’ solution is the two-fold solution: it’s the A320, A321, in particular the latter, the A321, that for the first time on a single-aisle airplane offers widebody economics and, gradually, widebody range for single-aisle trip costs,” Scherer elaborated. “At the same time we have a very very proven program, the A330, also re-engined so that we keep innovating and staying at the forefront of economic efficiency.

Suggesting that Airbus might well take a leaf from the playbook Boeing used to snatch Hawaiian Airlines’ widebodies out from under Airbus’ nose at last year’s Farnborough Air Show, Scherer noted that “we have a left-hook, right-hook approach to this middle of the market segment, with absolutely unbeatable economics, because these airplanes are offered with the latest engine technology and therefore the lowest fuel consumption, not to mention the comfort levels, but at the same time both programs are so mature that it gives Airbus…let’s call it the pricing flexibility that we need to address this extremely competitive segment of the market.”

Boeing is certainly stuck on the ‘rock’ of the A321neo and the A321LR long-range version of the family, which has significantly outsold its 737 MAX 9 and MAX 10 counterparts. The A330neo is less of a Charybdis to the A321neo’s Scylla, however: the market has by no means gone wild, particularly for the smaller -800 version.

And there was a notable lack of detail from Airbus about what the next part of the narrowbody “rock” will look like: “you can imagine our strategy,” said Scherer at an event where Airbus might have been expected to provide some clarity.

The airframer’s next move has been mooted as what Scherer described with something of a handwave as an “XLR, YLR, ZLR” slate of options. That said, on balance, it seems Airbus essentially has four most likely moves for the A321neo, which one could describe in the current Airbus naming style as follows:

1) the A322: a physical frame stretch of the A321neo, but without the LR’s extra fuel tanks.

2) the A321XLR: an A321neo, but with further supplementary fuel capacity to the A321LR’s existing fuel tanks.

3) the A322LR: the physical frame stretch and the existing A321LR fuel tanks.

4) the A322XLR: both the physical frame stretch and supplementary fuel capacity to the A321LR.

On the “hard place” side, a further option is to create an A330neo that is not “too much aircraft” like the A330-800neo, let alone the larger A330-900neo. This would be closer to the original regional aircraft vision for the A330, but seems less likely, particularly given the tepid response to the original A350 (essentially a re-engined A330) and the sunsetting of the A380. Airbus will not want to be seen to have misread the market again.

Still, the next move in the MoM game is Boeing’s. The US airframer appears strongly constrained by the 737 MAX situation. With every day that passes with the MAX still grounded before the Paris Air Show in mid-June it seems less likely that Boeing will be willing to make new announcements when the world arrives in Le Bourget. US operators of the MAX, meanwhile, are pushing out service reentry into late summer, even if the FAA ungrounds the MAX sooner.

Thus far, the MAX pain for PaxEx suppliers has been mitigated by the fact that Boeing continues to produce the MAX, albeit at a reduced rate, and hardware deliveries continue. For IFC providers specifically, however, grounded planes mean less service revenue.

For instance, at the end of Viasat’s fiscal fourth quarter, a total 47 Viasat IFC-fitted MAX aircraft were grounded, representing “4-ish% of our fleet”, according to CEO Mark Dankberg. But those planes get used a lot, he noted during the earnings call. “I think that, boy, we don’t profess to know anything more than what the market as a whole knows, so there’s hope that they’ll be in service again during the September quarter. We’re going to do what we can to support our airline customers. I think that, given that it’s that size of our fleet, you can think of it as having roughly proportional of revenue in that space.”

Airbus, in the position of strength with the A321neo, is under little obligation to increase demand for what is already a very in-demand aircraft — and one that would pose substantial issues in engine and cabin supply chains if looking to increase supply. Scherer has been clear that he is in a fortunate position in not having enough airplanes to sell.

The timing of the present situation is also of benefit to Airbus, with some complexities. If Airbus continues to sell the A321neo and A321LR as its primary MoM offering, the only downside is if early delivery airline customers feel bait-and-switched by the later arrival of any of the four other options. But even if those customers don’t manage later to change their aircraft to the improved versions before delivery, Airbus could almost certainly mollify those customers with a sweetheart deal, buybacks of the still-in-demand narrowbodies, or even potentially in-service upgrades.

A delay in announcing A320neo family incremental improvements could also perhaps be politic from a type certificate point of view. Scrutiny on certification is already intense during the MAX debacle, and one piece of fallout may be that the way supplemental type certificates for existing aircraft are regulated could change.

With the recent renaming of Embraer’s commercial aviation division to Boeing Brasil – Commercial, it may well be that the PAS19 focus for Boeing is in the regional and small airliner division.

The moves on the MoM chessboard after Le Bourget are clouded in haziness, externalities, chance and happenstance. For every cycle that Airbus continues to dominate the middle of the market, the appeal and purpose of the NMA diminishes, weakening a business case that is already under scrutiny.

"Airbus and Microsoft team up to sell holographic tech to airlines, defense and aerospace companies - GeekWire","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE5L2FpcmJ1cy1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbS1zZWxsLWhvbG9ncmFwaGljLXRlY2gtYWlybGluZXMtZGVmZW5zZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After four years using Microsoft’s HoloLens internally, aerospace giant Airbus is partnering with the tech company to sell specialized holographic programs that run on the mixed-reality headsets to other companies in aerospace and defense.

Microsoft and Airbus are unveiling the plan Monday at the Paris Air Show.

It’s part of a broader effort by Microsoft to get its latest device, HoloLens 2, into the hands of more big business customers, through a variety of programs that augment the physical world via headset. Microsoft is looking to differentiate itself from many others in virtual and augmented reality, such as Oculus and Magic Leap, by focusing primarily on business and industrial applications, rather than games and consumer apps.

Airbus is to looking to use mixed reality technology to expand into more parts of the global aerospace industry, while giving itself a technological edge. The company uses HoloLens to help train production workers and give them access to information and virtual instructions, and it says it has identified more than 300 additional uses for mixed reality in its operations.

“Our challenge in the coming years is to manufacture more aircraft faster, and for that we need to enable our workers to be much better equipped and to be much more effective in what they do. We need to raise the bar,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus executive vice president of engineering, in a news release announcing the expanded partnership.

Airbus rival Boeing, Microsoft’s longtime neighbor in the Seattle region, has also been experimenting with HoloLens to help with everything from airplane manufacturing to fighting wildfires with drones. Boeing even featured the Microsoft device in a video last month congratulating its European competitor on its 50th anniversary.

The first tech solution offered under the expanded partnership between Microsoft and Airbus will be a program that lets airline maintenance workers and cabin crews train in a 3D holographic environment, and access virtual instructions on the job via HoloLens, without needing to pick up a physical instruction manual.

This technology was first developed by Airbus and Japan Airlines, and will now be made available by Airbus and Microsoft to other companies, as well.

Airbus is also expected to offer a holographic map technology “that allows participants from the defense and aerospace fields to virtually connect, quickly share space data and interact with complex virtual environments to plan and prepare ahead of missions,” according to the announcement.

The companies say Airbus is also working on other mixed reality applications for maintenance, training and remote collaboration.

The collaboration on holographic technology is an example of an ongoing partnership between Microsoft and Airbus, which separately last year began shifting its entire workforce away from Microsoft’s Office 365 to Google’s G Suite, according to a report at the time in the Register.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9651157855987549}",neutral,0.9651157855987549,0
Airbus A300: The history of the plane that launched an empire - CNN,"Sat, 01 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtaGlzdG9yeS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

This year, around 4 billion plane passengers will take to the sky – and most of them will travel in an Airbus or a Boeing.

These two Goliaths have dominated aerospace manufacturing for half a century, with few competitors coming close.

While US company Boeing, the world leader, has been around since 1916, its European rival Airbus emerged much later.

In the years after World War II, American companies dominated the aviation industry and so, in the late 1960s, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, then known as Airbus Industrie, came together to develop a challenger.

On May 29, 1969, at the Paris Air Show, an historic agreement was signed between the French Minister of Transport Jean Chamant and the German Minister of Economic Affairs Karl Schiller.

Airbus Industrie would develop the world’s first wide-body twin-engine jet airliner, the Airbus A300. It was a plane that would launch an empire.

Light and efficient

There were a couple of innovations that made this plane special. The wide body and raised cabin floor meant it could carry passengers and cargo at the same time, allowing airlines to increase profitability.

The wings, designed by Hawker Siddeley, gave the airplane enough lift to climb faster and attain a level cruise altitude sooner than other passenger aircraft of the time, giving cabin crew more time for the in-flight service.

It could hold 270 passengers and, with a range of 1,200 nautical miles, was designed to serve the short- to medium-haul market.

Because it had two engines rather than the standard three, it was lighter and more efficient than its contemporary US rivals, such as the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10.

Construction

Construction was a pan-European exercise.

The wings were constructed in the UK, then transported to Bremen, Germany. to be fitted with moving surfaces. They were then shipped to nearby Lemwerder, Germany, where they – along with the rear fuselage sections – were flown to the final assembly line in Toulouse, France.

The engines came from the US, the tail assemblies from Spain, while the central wingbox and nose were built in the French towns of St Nazaire and Nantes.

The road convoy of parts to the assembly line attracted curious crowds – an Airbus tradition that would continue through the decades, with people regularly turning out to see the components arrive for the mammoth A380.

Unveiling

The A300B was unveiled to the French public on September 28, 1972, in a joint ceremony with another European plane which was to make history: the legendary, supersonic Concorde.

The A300B made its first flight one month later, in October 1972, landing in high crosswinds that tested the mettle of pilots Max Fischl and Bernard Ziegler.

The plane entered service with Air France in May 1974. Sales were slow at the start, and it was unclear whether the European start-up would survive.

Three-engine planes were still the industry standard, and there was skepticism whether two engines could safely carry passengers over long distances.

A lifeline appeared in 1977 when the US-based Eastern Airlines gave them a shot by leasing four planes for six months. The company ended up buying those craft and ordering 19 more.

Expansion

A decade after the arrival of the A300, the Airbus family expanded with the A310 taking to the air in 1982 and the A300-600 in 1983.

The A310 was a shorter, longer-ranger aircraft than the 300, seating 218 in a two-class configuration.

The A300-600, meanwhile, introduced an improved wing featuring a recambered trailing edge.

The A300/A310 would spawn many variants, but two stand out as the most exciting.

There’s the Airbus A300 Zero-G, a reduced-gravity aircraft used for training astronauts. And then there’s the A300-600ST Beluga, a huge, whale-shaped cargo freight version of the A300-600, used to transport Airbus parts from factory to final assembly line.

Legacy

“The legacy of the A-300 lies in the innovations and their applications … in the fields of composite structures, wing tips (for drag reduction), electrical signaling for secondary controls [and] control of center of gravity,” says Ruxandra Botez, Canada research chair in aircraft modeling and simulation technologies at the University of Quebec.

It was the first passenger aircraft to use composite materials, with fiber-reinforced plastic being used in its tail fin.

Its “successful demonstration of the wide body twin-jet configuration,” says Luigi Martinelli, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, led to it becoming “the de facto standard.”

“The wing design was quite advanced for the time as it is concurrent with the introduction of supercritical airfoils, and the adoption of other novel technologies,” he adds.

The introduction of a two-person cockpit eliminated the need for an on-board flight engineer, and it also pioneered fly-by-wire control, improving handling and safety.

Still in service

In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS-compliant aircraft. The draw for this with customers was that it qualified for extended twin-engine operations over water, offering more versatility in routing.

“The initial shortcoming of the project was probably a lack of understanding of the market,” says Martinelli. “I think it is fair to say that the A300 was saved by the ETOPS certification, which opened up a viable market for the plane.”

Guillaume Faury, the CEO of Airbus, said in a statement marking the 50th anniversary, that Airbus “has been a showcase of European integration.”

While the collaborate European project it was unveiled alongside, the Concorde, has captured the public imagination more, the A300 has made its mark as a reliable workhorse.

By the time construction of the A300 ceased in 2007, 561 had been made. Many are still in service today.

Today, they’re mostly used as freight aircraft, with UPS Airlines and FedEx Express its biggest operators.

UPS Airlines Captain Mark Melder tells CNN Travel, “As a captain on the A300 for 17 years, I am a true fan and advocate for the aircraft. Its reliability, performance and comfort have proven it to be a pilot’s aircraft.

“Things are only going to get better for those of us that fly the A300, as we are in the process of modernizing the flight deck. This will keep us flying this tremendous aircraft well into the future.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996320009231567}",neutral,0.9996320009231567,0
How the albatross is inspiring next generation of aircraft wings - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNi1ob3ctdGhlLWFsYmF0cm9zcy1pcy1pbnNwaXJpbmctbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXdpbmdz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus engineers have developed a scale-model aeroplane with the first in-flight, flapping wing-tips that could revolutionise aircraft wing-design.



The aerospace giant has drawn on nature to develop its ‘semi-aeroelastic hinge’ concept to reduce drag and overall wing weight, while combating the effects of turbulence and wind gusts.

Known as AlbatrossOne, the remote-controlled aircraft has already taken its first flights to prove the concept and the team will now conduct further testing before the demonstrator, based on the manufacturer’s A321 plane, is scaled-up further.

“While hinged wing-tips are not new – military jets employ them to allow greater storage capacity on aircraft carriers – the Airbus demonstrator is the first aircraft to trial in-flight, freely-flapping wing-tips to relieve the effects of wind gusts and turbulence,” explained Airbus engineer Tom Wilson, based in Filton, north Bristol, UK.

“We drew inspiration from nature – the albatross marine bird locks its wings at the shoulder for long-distance soaring but unlocks them when wind-gusts occur or manoeuvering is required.

“The AlbatrossOne model will explore the benefits of unlockable, freely-flapping wing-tips – accounting for a up to a third of the length of the wing – to react autonomously during in-flight turbulence and lessen the load on the wing at its base, so reducing the need for heavily reinforced wing boxes.”

Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus’ Executive Vice-President of Engineering, said the project showed “how nature can inspire us”. He said: “When there is a wind gust or turbulence, the wing of a conventional aircraft transmits huge loads to the fuselage, so the base of the wing must be heavily strengthened, adding weight to the aircraft.

“Allowing the wing-tips to react and flex to gusts reduces the loads and allows us to make lighter and longer wings – the longer the wing, the less drag it creates up to an optimum, so there are potentially more fuel efficiencies to exploit.”

The first test flights of the AlbatrossOne demonstrator, developed by Airbus engineers in Filton, were concluded in February after a 20-month development programme. Speaking in Toulouse, Dumont said AlbatrossOne was the “first Filton aircraft since Concorde”.

It has been constructed from carbonfibre and glassfibre-reinforced polymers, as well as components from additive-layer manufacturing.

Initial testing of AlbatrossOne has examined the demonstrator’s stability with the wing-tips locked and completely unlocked, says fellow Filton engineer James Kirk.

“The next step is to conduct further tests to combine the two modes, allowing the wing-tips to unlock during flight and to examine the transition,” he added.

The team presented their research at the International Forum on Aeroelasticity and Structural Dynamics conference in the United States this week.

Le Bourget, 18 June 2019 – Optaforce, a software solution developed by Airbus Defence and Space in partnership with start-up company COSLING to optimise the planning of aircraft maintenance, will be deployed on the French MIRAGE 2000 fleet in autumn 2019.

This innovative solution was developed as part of the OptiPlan Challenge launched in 2018 by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) via its DGA Lab, with the support of the French Aeronautical Maintenance Department (DMAé). Optaforce is based on a high-performance optimisation algorithm using Artificial Intelligence and offers an ergonomic interface that can generate multiple planning scenarios.

“In just three months, thanks to intensive collaboration with COSLING, we have successfully created a prototype that meets with the expectations of the DMAé,” said François Lombard, Director of Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space. “Optaforce will help to better manage the resources of the French Air Force.”

Optaforce will maximise aircraft availability, reduce maintenance costs and optimise the use of resources. It will also be possible to manage contingencies and easily reconfigure aircraft for new missions, thus saving time and improving fleet management.

“We built the algorithm by successive iterations integrating the suggestions and remarks of the Chief Warrant Officers as we proceeded. This agile operation allowed us to quickly develop a functional prototype, able to help all stakeholders in their decision making. It was great to build Optaforce with such motivated people and we will continue to work with Airbus and the French armed forces with pride and pleasure,” said Jean-Guillaume FAGES, Co-founder of COSLING.

In addition to managing the Mirage 2000 fleet, the Optaforce solution can be used to optimise the planning of other fleets in service with the French armed forces and, more generally, any fleet covered by a maintenance programme. Optaforce is currently on display at the Paris Air Show 2019 and can be seen at the stand of the French Ministry of the Armed Forces.

The Newport Hub helps promote Wales’ reputation for cyber excellence by developing cyber talent in the region and engaging with Welsh industry and academia.

An ambitious cyber security initiative jointly funded by the Welsh Government and Airbus called CyberLab is hosted at the Airbus Cyber Innovation Hub. The dedicated up to £8 million programme of activity and research in a laboratory environment develops fundamental cyber security research for key industrial requirements in advanced manufacturing organisations.

Partnerships with academia are key to Airbus Cyber Innovation’s goal of identifying and developing emerging research and technology.

The Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Analytics is a partnership with Cardiff University launched in 2017. A leading UK academic research unit for cyber security analytics, the team is developing new ways of protecting corporate IT networks, intellectual property and critical national infrastructure from cyber attacks.

Beyond this, close collaboration between Cardiff University and Airbus Cyber Innovation has been a great asset in driving innovation and skills development forward for Wales and the wider world.

The Centre of Excellence in Industrial Control System (ICS) Security is a longstanding partnership with De Montfort University’s Cyber Technology Institute (CTI). This initiative is focused on the research of tools, techniques and knowledge for the protection of Industrial Control Systems.

Attending the opening, Ken Skates AM, Minister for Economy and Transport, said: “I am delighted to be working in partnership with Airbus on this exciting and absolutely vital new facility. This Cyber Innovation Hub will give front line leadership in cyber security to companies and enterprises across Wales and indeed the UK for this and future generations. I view Cyber as a building block for every commercial enterprise in Wales. It is not only larger businesses that should be concerned about cyber security, it is every size of business across the entire Country who needs to take action now to safeguard our national infrastructure and strong supply chain.”

Dr Kevin Jones, Head of Airbus Cyber Innovation, said: “The launch of the Cyber Innovation Hub is further recognition of the strategic importance of the cybersecurity research and innovation programme for Airbus. It demonstrates the company’s commitment to cybersecurity and research into the protection of business and critical systems and recognises the value of the cyber security ecosystem in Wales. The flagship cyber innovation laboratory and CyberLab programme enables transformation of the cyber security horizon, and further enhances the “Cyber Wales” brand on a global scale.”

Katherine Bennett CBE, Airbus Senior Vice President for the UK, said “Airbus works very closely with our partners from academia and government right across our UK business manufacturing and designing aircraft, satellites and helicopters. The opening of our Cyber Innovation Hub is another fantastic example of how, working together, we can boost important research into this critical, fast-developing sector which helps to protect not only Airbus’ own products and systems but those of our customers around the world.”

Airbus tests its Network for the Sky on a MRTT aircraft - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNi1haXJidXMtdGVzdHMtaXRzLW5ldHdvcmstZm9yLXRoZS1za3ktb24tYS1tcnR0LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusDefence

13 June 2019 – Airbus has successfully completed a flight demonstration of a connected airborne battlespace scenario, centred on a MRTT aircraft. The test was carried out as part of the development of Airbus’ Network for the Sky (NFTS) programme. This follows on from last August’s demonstration in Canada of secure mobile communications using a stratospheric balloon to simulate a HAPS (High Altitude Pseudo Satellite), such as Airbus’ Zephyr UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).

NFTS combines various technologies - satellite and ground communications, air-to-ground, ground-to-air and air-to-air tactical links, 5G mobile communications and laser connections - in a resilient, unified, secure, highly interoperable, mesh network. Aircraft, UAVs and helicopters currently use networks with limited bandwidth and interoperability, and often little resilience. NFTS will allow them to form an integral part of high-speed military networks.

“This unique demonstration is a significant milestone in realising our vision of secure connectivity, which will enable the future air combat cloud and enhance real time execution of military missions,” said Evert Dudok, Head of Communications, Intelligence & Security at Airbus Defence and Space.

The demonstration scenario simulates the establishment of multi-Mbit/s, wideband communication links between ground forces operatives, a fighter jet, a MRTT, and a combined air operations centre (CAOC) on the ground. Both the operatives and jet fighter had to send video in real time to provide enhanced real-time situational awareness and receive instructions from the CAOC in return.

The operative located in Getafe (Spain) was equipped with a standard handheld radio for NATO forces (ROVER). The fighter was deployed to obtain imagery of the area of interest and act as a communications node between the operative and the MRTT flying at 30,000 feet within a 150 km radius in secure airspace. Communications were thus relayed between the fighter jet and the MRTT, via a wideband LOS (line-of-sight) data link. The MRTT then routed the video along with its own communications via a wideband satellite link to an space teleport near Washington, D.C. The communications flow was then returned to Europe via a terrestrial link to the CAOC.

This complex scenario demonstrates the real-time operation of secure end-to-end communications across different networks and technologies: ground-air tactical link, air-air wideband link between two aircrafts, air-satellite relay and terrestrial networks. This type of configuration, known as a ‘hybrid network’, represents the future of military communications and meets the needs of armed forces to be able to use a wide range of networks while allowing these to be managed dynamically and transparently. The solutions developed by Airbus thus allow secure IP (Internet Protocol) communications to be established, links to be reconfigured in real time and the available bandwidth to be allocated to data links based on operational priorities.

For this demonstration an MRTT aircraft has been equipped with Janus, Airbus’ new tri-band (Ku-Ka-MilKa) satellite antenna, as well as the latest version of the Proteus satellite modem, which is highly resilient against interference and jamming, and Airbus’ aircraft links integration management system (ALIMS).

This exercise paves the way for the development of the core capability for SMART MRTT connectivity, which will allow the MRTT to act as a high-end communication node. Network for the Sky (NFTS) sets the foundation for the connected airborne battlespace, with the objective to offer a full operational capability by 2020. The NFTS programme is part of Airbus’ Future Air Power project and is fully aligned with the development of the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

MR, VR and AR see traction in manufacturing

Aerospace and manufacturing industries have emerged as one of the primary areas XR technologies are gaing traction traction.

“I am already seeing significant adoption of XR for the aerospace industry because of the cost of the components and the difficulty and cost of training,” said Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “By bringing these barriers down and reducing cost, these technologies are quickly being implemented in many different engineering applications, including aerospace.”

HoloLens devices could offer greater insight into the progress of manufacturing within Airbus, he said.

“I believe it will be absolutely crucial to the company’s front-line workers because now the company will have real-time data about where in the manufacturing process each part of the plane is at, as opposed to at the end of the day when the workers finish their jobs,” he said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9515182971954346}",positive,0.9515182971954346,1

Airbus is set to launch its updated A321XLR at the Paris Air Show next week, another incremental performance push for its single-aisle jet as it adds more range and seeks to squeeze Boeing’s options for its own all-new mid-market airliner, according to four people familiar with the company’s plans.

Airbus continues to finalize the slate of buyers for the jet’s formal commercial debut next week at the biennial aerospace gathering which begins June 17, but the launch will be a mix of both new purchase commitments, as well as conversions of existing A320neo family aircraft orders. The Paris deals for the aircraft are expected to include buyers from different regions of the world, including at least one U.S. airline, two of the people said.

Firm specifications of the new aircraft have yet to be disclosed by the company, but one person briefed on the jet’s performance said that the aircraft will be able to complete a U.S. transcontinental flight from New York to Los Angeles against the usual seasonal headwinds with a full complement of 240 passengers and their bags.

The Chicago-based maker of the 737 said it will provide parts for British Airways' Airbus A320s and its A320neo narrow-body jets.

Boeing two years ago separated out its aircraft services business, which CEO Dennis Muilenburg said could grow to a $50 billion-a-year business. The unit generated more than $17 billion of Boeing's record $101 billion in sales last year.

Boeing has been trying to increase its control in the aircraft-part supply chain, efforts that have included joint ventures or outright acquisitions. The effort included deals with companies that make airplane engines, seats and other components.

Under the agreement, Boeing will own and manage parts for British Airways, which operates both Boeing and Airbus planes, it said.

""We are proud to have the opportunity to serve British Airways' needs regardless of platform,"" Boeing's senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing, Ihssane Mounir, said in a release.

Airbus could offer a similar arrangement for its airline customers who operate mixed fleets, such as British Airways, but it does not currently have a customer for that service, Airbus spokesman James Darcy.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998601675033569}",positive,0.9998601675033569,1
How much trouble does Airbus's new plane pose to Boeing? - The Economist,"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZ3VsbGl2ZXIvMjAxOS8wNi8yMS9ob3ctbXVjaC10cm91YmxlLWRvZXMtYWlyYnVzcy1uZXctcGxhbmUtcG9zZS10by1ib2VpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BOEING, AN American aerospace giant, had once hoped that it would have a good week at this year’s Paris Air Show, which ends on June 23rd. It was expected to launch the 797, a new mid-sized jet to fill the gap in its range between its smaller 737 narrow-body airliner and its much larger 787 and 777 wide-body jets. But instead it was Airbus, its European arch-rival, that launched a plane that fitted this criteria. The A321XLR (the XLR stands for “extra long range”) is a version of the planemaker’s popular narrow-body adapted to boost its range to 5,400 miles (8,700 km). This is made possible by enlarging the aircraft’s centre fuel tank. It is a move that could spell trouble for Boeing’s own plans to fill the middle of the market.

The A321XLR is a plane “that is of interest to the entire world,” says Francois Caudron, a marketing boss at Airbus. He says the demand for the proposed jet came from airlines flying previous A321 models, which had a range of about 4,000 miles. “The market, asked us, ‘With the A321 now, we can fly from the East Coast of the United States into Europe, but we can’t really go deep into Europe. We can’t go to Rome. So Airbus, can you do something to give us another 500 nautical miles?’” The company responded, he says, with a new fuel tank configuration that added an extra 700 nautical miles.

Boeing had hoped to answer that same question with its proposed Boeing 797. The American firm had hoped that it would serve as a replacement for the Boeing 757 and 767, two older mid-sized jets. But Mr Caudron says that Airbus also sees the new model as a replacement for Boeing’s 757. Both are narrow-body jets and they offer the same range and similar seating capacities. The XLR also burns 30% less fuel than the 757. Boeing’s proposed New Midsize Airplane (NMA) is instead a wide-body aircraft with two instead of one aisle. It has a slightly larger seating capacity and has more range than the XLR. So it seems much more like a replacement for the Boeing 767 in terms of size and design. All the extra space would certainly make it a more comfortable plane than the XLR for flyers. But it would also be more costly plane to fly, as the wider fuselage increases the amount of drag on the plane. And as passengers increasingly choose the cheapest tickets whatever the service on board an airline is like, that could harm sales.

Much has been made of Boeing’s other troubles for the postponement of the 797’s launch. It is true that the continued grounding of its 737 MAX planes, due to safety worries following two crashes of the type in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people, does not help. But even before the 737 MAX’s problems, the business case for the 797 was already weak. Analysts have long said that the business plan only made sense if the profits from aftermarket services, such as maintenance checks and spare parts, were enough to make up the losses produced by designing and building the planes. With the XLR eating into the bottom of that market, it has become weaker still.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999644756317139}",neutral,0.9999644756317139,0

The MoU, signed by Air Commodore Dayasagar, Executive Director at PHL and Ashish Saraf, Head of Airbus Helicopters for India and South Asia, also includes customised training and an on-site Safety Management System (SMS) for PHL pilots.

The MoU stipulates that Airbus Helicopters will support PHL in growing its onshore, offshore and inland travel markets by introducing the best-in-class H145 and H225 rotorcrafts into their fleet. Airbus Helicopters will also provide predictive and scheduled maintenance, repair and overhaul services for PHL’s existing Airbus AS365N Dauphin helicopters, the MoU said.

PHL is the largest customer in the world for Airbus Dauphin helicopters. It currently has 37 units deployed for offshore Oil & Gas operations, VIP transportation and other utility duties.

The H145 and H225 are multi-role helicopters, ideal for supporting PHL’s wide range of missions across the country. The H145 is a member of Airbus’ four-tonne-class twin-engine helicopter product range with designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions. The H145 family (BK117, EC145 and H145) has more than 1,300 helicopters in service around the world and has clocked more than 5.5 million flight hours.

The 11-tonne twin-engine H225 is the choice of commercial operators and governmental agencies for its long range and all-weather capabilities. Its payload and range capacity make the H225 the most cost-effective helicopter for long-distance offshore operations, such as PHL’s inter-island operations around the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands.

The H225 is the latest member of Airbus’ proven Super Puma family, which has accumulated more than 5.5 million flight hours in operation around the world, including in highly challenging maritime environments and severe icing conditions.

Airbus integration of A220 programme into Airbus Customer Support & Services network is underway - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDYtYWlyYnVzLWludGVncmF0aW9uLW9mLWEyMjAtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWludG8tYWlyYnVzLWN1c3RvbWVyLXN1cHBvcnQtc2VydmljZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A220 Customer Services activities are being integrated into the Airbus network, in order to provide customers with improved and efficient support & services, fully supported by Airbus. This will leverage Airbus’ experience and resources in the following areas: field service representatives (FSRs) and customer support directors (CSDs); training materials; cabin operations; fleet performance; and flight simulation products.

To accomplish this, the specific integration streams are being rolled-out as follows:

Airbus is providing FSRs to support the A220 fleet. CSD support will be provided by either Airbus Canada or Airbus, dependent on the set-up within an individual operator.

Airbus is developing for Airbus Canada the flight, flight attendant and maintenance training courseware content. This material, which will become available starting next year, will be used by the A220 Approved Training Providers. Accordingly, Airbus will replace Bombardier’s Flight Attendance Training Guidelines with an A220 Cabin Crew Operating Manual by mid-next year.

Airbus Canada is shifting to Airbus tools and methodology to compute the A220 aircraft reliability and other performance metrics which will provide a harmonized experience with other Airbus platforms. Leveraging Skywise capabilities, Airbus Canada will thus offer new digital tools for improved processes in the coming year.

Airbus Canada and Airbus teams are preparing the transfer of the support to operators and training device manufacturers related to simulator data package and hardware. This activity will take place during the summer.

In addition, all material services (trade parts and smart parts) will be led by and under the responsibility of SATAIR and Airbus Flight Hours Services (FHS) respectively to support the A220 programme. Airbus Canada, Airbus FHS, SATAIR and Bombardier are currently working on a transfer plan together with the A220 operators that will materialize by the end of the year.

Last but not least, Airbus maintenance operations and working parties teams will also take over from Bombardier’s A220 mobile repair team (MRT) for all major repair needs. This transition will last about a year, and in the meantime Airbus Canada and Bombardier MRT will support customers until the Airbus teams are fully operational on the A220.

The purchase agreement includes the conversion of 30 of American’s existing A321neo slots to A321XLRs and incremental orders for an additional 20 A321XLRs.

The A321XLR will have the longest range of any single-aisle commercial jetliner. The added range of up to 4,700 nm will allow airlines to operate the aircraft from U.S. East Coast airports to medium-size European cities.



As a further enhancement of the A321neo and A321LR, the A321XLR will have a maximum takeoff weight of 101 metric tonnes without sacrificing performance. The A321XLR is powered by the same engines, and has more than 90 percent commonality with the A321neo.



American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is the largest Airbus operator in the world with 422 Airbus aircraft. Including today’s announcement, American has outstanding orders for 115 A321neos and A321XLRs from Airbus.



The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – 15% more than the A321LR and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft. For passengers, the A321XLR’s new Airspace cabin will provide the best travel experience offering seats in all classes on a single-aisle aircraft.

"Airbus confirms A321XLR, trails A330neo orders in new market segments - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWNvbmZpcm1zLWEzMjF4bHItdHJhaWxzLWEzMzBuZW8tb3JkZXJzLWluLW5ldy1tYXJrZXQtc2VnbWVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2019 is a transitional year for Airbus as the A220 beds into the airframer’s product line, the A380 heads into the sunset and further evolutions of the A320neo and A350 families continue to be mooted. The Paris Air Show is also the first major show since Airbus itself reorganised around a new executive team, notably on the commercial side with Guillaume Faury essentially succeeding both Tom Enders and Fabrice Brégier, and Christian Scherer taking over for larger-than-life chief salesman John Leahy.

“I have the easiest job in this industry, owing to the quality of our products,” Scherer quipped at the beginning of a media briefing in Paris the Friday before the airshow. And indeed, the airframer is forecasting substantial demand.

“Our global market forecast sees, over the next twenty years, a little bit more than 37,000 commercial aircraft delivering into this market, of which about 28,500 or so are single aisle. In the medium category, we see about 5,500, and in the larger category about 3,300 aircraft,” Scherer said.

The key change for Airbus’ forecast is the absence of the A380’s ’XL’ segment, which it has combined together. Scherer’s slides split out “small” as the A220 (né Bombardier C Series) and the “A320 family”, which used an A320neo as illustration.

Separated from the “A320 family” on the “medium” slide is the A321neo — interestingly using the livery of the A321LR neo variant, but with the A321neo label — and the A330neo.

“Large”, following the sunsetting of the A380 programme, is the A350 family, with both the -900 and -1000 shown on Scherer’s slides.

“About a good third of deliveries are foreseen to be in the greater Asia-Pacific region, including China and India of course. Europe, North America and South America are about the same, and then the rest of the world are the other third,” Scherer said.

Scherer noted that Airbus’ forecast is relatively lower than others’ (particularly Boeing’s) in the single-aisle category, noting at the same time Airbus’ previous and current strength in this market segment, both with the strong sales of the A320 family at the higher end of the category and the A220 at the lower end.

“In the middle of the bell-shaped curve of distribution of aircraft, we have the very, very proven new neo families, the A320neo family and the A330neos. Then on the side, on the smaller capacity aircraft we have a brand new family with the A220, and on the upper long-range segment we have a brand-new — the only brand-new — capacity long-range family with the A350s,” Scherer said.

There is, of course something of a cognitive disconnect between Scherer’s criticism of the 777X, positioning the A350 as the “only brand-new” airplane while also calling the A330neo “brand new”.

“In the infamous middle of the market, we address it with two solutions,” Scherer noted. “We address it with the A321neo, as I mentioned now with an exit limit of up to 240 seats and a range of 4000 [nautical] miles and, hint hint hint, maybe a little bit more in the near future.”

In other words: following some muted messages last month, expect the A321XLR this week.

“That’s the lower end of the medium, the mid-size market. At the upper end of the mid-size market we have a brand new airplane called the A330neo,” Scherer said, highlighting the mixed-fleet opportunities of the A320 and A330 families, as used by airlines including Finnair and Thomas Cook that operate both aircraft, creating substantial pilot rostering efficiencies.

In an effort to push back against the narrative of the A330neo as slow-selling, Scherer noted that there are “19 customers for the A330neo, of a total market that has 121 customers.”

Scherer also gave a nudge-nudge, wink-wink nod that he expects to announce more A330neo orders at Le Bourget, saying that the market should, “by the way, keep watching. The A330 is a very efficient way to address this marketplace.”

Of these, eight are destined for Iberia and six for Aer Lingus.

IAG, the parent company of leading airlines also including British Airways, Level and Vueling, is one of Airbus’s largest customers and this agreement will take the overall order from the group to 530 aircraft. IAG airlines combined operate one of the world’s largest Airbus fleets with over 400 aircraft.

The aircraft will enable Aer Lingus to launch new routes beyond the US East Coast and Canada. For Iberia, this is a new aircraft type that will enable it to operate new transatlantic destinations and increase frequencies in key markets.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – 15% more than the A321LR and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft. This will enable operators to open new world-wide routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, as well as further extending the Family’s non-stop reach on direct transatlantic flights between continental Europe and the Americas. For passengers, the A321XLR’s new Airspace cabin will provide the best travel experience, while offering seats in all classes with the same high-comfort as on a long-haul wide-body, with the low costs of a single-aisle aircraft.

Why The Airbus A350 Was The Make It Or Break It Aircraft For Airbus - AeroTime,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjMxMTEtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtaW1wb3J0YW5jZdIBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjMxMTEtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtaW1wb3J0YW5jZS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why The Airbus A350 Was The Make It Or Break It Aircraft For Airbus

Exactly 6 years ago, on June 14th, 2013, the Airbus A350 made its first flight.

On that day, everyone at Airbus was generally anxious – the Airbus A350 will either lift the company up or, if unsuccessful, would spiral Airbus into a slow failure.

At the beginning of the day, the workers at Toulouse watching the first Airbus A350 flight live and the people at other Airbus manufacturing sites watching live streams were nervously waiting for the lift-off of the A350.

At the end of the day, a collective sigh of relief could probably be heard all over Europe.

But why? Why was the Airbus A350 so important to the company?

In short, wide-body aircraft.

On a longer note, let’s try to understand the at-the-time situation at Airbus, the wide-body market and how did it all turn out, 6 years later.

The Airbus A350 similarities with the Boeing 737 MAX

Ironically, just like Boeing had a huge headache with the Airbus A320neo in 2011, so did Airbus with the Boeing 787. Initially, Airbus thought that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would go head-to-head with the Airbus A330, but as time went on, Airbus realized that they needed a response to the Dreamliner.

In addition, Airbus was already investing a lot of money into the Airbus A380, as Airbus saw a gap in the very large aircraft market. The Airbus A380 recorded its first test flight in 2005. A year earlier, in a private meeting with various airlines, Airbus CEO Noël Forgeard announced a new model that did not have a name at the time.

The new model was supposed to complement the existing A330. A new aircraft would be dubbed the A330-200 Lite and promise an increased range – the fuselage would stay the same, meaning no extra passengers would be seated on the aircraft. But the 787 promised to do everything better than the A330 Lite – more range, more passengers and most importantly, it was more economical due to the new engines and materials used on the frame.

Anyhow, airlines initially were not very keen – Airbus received limited attention to its new project, as customers wanted something new and better than the Boeing 787 or the Airbus A330. If Airbus wanted to beat Boeing in the twin-engine long-haul aircraft market, it would need something revolutionary to sway airlines from ordering the Dreamliner.

And an A330 Lite was not the solution.

Airbus was back to the drawing board under a difficult time – the A380 had its own fair share of production issues and the aviation sector was facing a downturn. But Airbus had to do something, as Boeing was dominating the industry at the time.

Drawing the wide-body market

In the late ’90s to early 2000s when Airbus announced the A350 for the first time in 2004, the commercial aviation looked quite different from what it is today.

Boeing was clearly ahead of Airbus, as it had several wide-body jets out at the time – 747, 767 and the 777.

Meanwhile, Airbus had the A300, A310, A330 and the A340.

In addition, you had the tri-jet wide-bodies at the time – the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar.

But the tri-jets were nearing their expiration date and Boeing absorbed McDonnell Douglas, including all of their aircraft, as McDonnell Douglas was heavily struggling with the repercussions from their decision to release the MD-11 with three engines. At a time when everyone in the aviation industry started to tilt towards twin-engine configurations, someone had to be the stubborn guy, right?

The Queen Of The Skies had free reign, as the A380 would only make its debut in 2007 and the Boeing 767 safely handled Airbus‘ competition of the A300 and the A310.

The Airbus A330 and the Boeing 777 are fairly similar in size and passenger capacity, with the 777 having the slight advantage in both categories. However, the Airbus A330 had more range (except on the 777‘s ER and LR versions) and was much cheaper to purchase back in those days.

Nevertheless, the two jets had found their comfortable place under the sun. They are both getting updated with the A330neo already flying commercially since last December with TAP Portugal, while the new 777X is set to make its commercial debut in the summer of 2020. Engine issues might delay that date, as GE is experiencing problems with the new GE9X engine.

Quad-engine mistakes

While McDonnell Douglas managed to shut their coffin with the final nail called the MD-11, Airbus made the same mistake with the A340. Fortunately, the mistake did not cost them the company.

Simply put, the A340 shared a lot of the same parts with the A330, reducing the R&D and production costs for the European conglomerate.

But in the late 1980s, when tri-jets like the L-1011 became obsolete due to ETOPS rules when twin-engine aircraft like the Airbus A300 or the Boeing 767 could cross oceans and fly between North America and Europe.

Great news followed in 1989 when American Airlines (A1G) (AAL) crossed the Pacific Ocean on a validation flight from Dallas to Hawaii with a Boeing 767-300 ER. The FAA granted American Airlines (A1G) (AAL) their 180-minute ETOPS certificate and the doors to twin engines operating long-haul routes, previously unavailable to them, opened up.

In short, ETOPS was a rule for twin-engine aircraft in order to guarantee their safety. On a commercial flight, an aircraft with two engines could not fly a route that did not have an airport within a 60-minute flight distance to divert to. Aviation authorities increased the time period for diversions, which resulted in the 1989 breakthrough for airplanes with two engines.

But two years after the 1989 ETOPS extension, Airbus introduced a new aircraft – the A340.

With four engines.

Emirates Airbus A340

Meanwhile, Boeing officially introduced the 777 in 1989 and the American manufacturer began taking orders from airlines for their newest wide-body.

At the time, the future was clear – Boeing had seen the slowing orders for the 747 and the fact that airline executives did not want new trijets.

Somehow, Airbus missed the memo.

While the A330 became one of the most successful aircraft of the Airbus range, the A340 did not. In total, airlines ordered only 377 Airbus A340s.

In contrast, airlines already ordered 230 Airbus A330neos, according to Airbus’ order and deliveries files up to May 2019.

On the other side of the competition, airlines have ordered 2033 Boeing 777s, with 217 of them being Freighters.

Importance of the Airbus A350

Looking at the numbers alone, the message is clear – the Airbus A340 was not successful. While it might have been a record-breaker at the time for performance, airlines were not very keen on the project and when fuel prices soared, so did the operational costs of the airliner. In order to avoid making a loss each flight, carriers placed the quad-engine aircraft on a limited number of routes or tried to sell them.

But Airbus had a saving grace – the A340 shared a lot of the same parts with the A330. Thus, the company saved itself from being riddled with huge debts.

Nevertheless, we can outline two main reasons for the A350:

Firstly, Boeing announced the 787 that Airbus had no answer for;

Secondly, Airbus still had a gap left in the market that the A340 failed to fill.

Looking in hindsight, if Airbus would have decided against the decision to design the A350, it would lose a total of 893 orders it currently has for the aircraft. Potentially, the market of ultra-long-haul jets is at 2333 aircraft, combining both the 787 and the A350 orders.

Essentially, if Airbus still wanted to have a say in the big wide-body market, the A350 was a must.

Orders are slowly picking up after airlines order very big numbers of the A350 in 2013, 2008 and 2007. Apart those years, airline orders were scarce and at the lowest point, carriers only ordered 10 Airbus A350’s in 2011.

But more airlines are looking into the A350.

Achieving goals

In the grand scheme of things, a BBC article published in 2013 estimates the development costs to be around € 11 billion. At the 2009 Paris Air Show, Tom Enders, who recently retired from the position of CEO at Airbus, has also indicated the cost to be €11 billion. In a press release discussing the financial results of 2018, Airbus has noted that the company plans to break-even on the A350 program in 2019.

As production increases, so does the general profit of the program. According to several sources, Airbus currently produces 10 A350’s a month. The European manufacturer achieved this target rate at the end of 2018.

As a result, Airbus has its hands full with the production of the A350 – a happy change from the dry sea of the A340 orders. So, essentially Airbus achieved one of its goals – it replaced the sub-par sales performance of the A340 and the program looks like it has a bright future ahead of it.

What about providing an answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner?

The Airbus A350 model range, when compared to the 787 range has the bigger range (including ULR flights), can seat more passengers and has more cargo capacity.

However, the Boeing 787 is significantly cheaper. Although aircraft manufacturers publish base prices, the real prices airlines pay for aircraft are kept in the dark between the two parties. Nevertheless, they can still indicate that the Airbus A350 is much more expensive.

For example, when comparing the A350-1000 and the 787-10, the latter is $28 million cheaper. The same story repeats itself when comparing the A350-900 and the 787-9, as both manufacturers list the price to be at $317.4 million and $292.5 million respectively.

In reality, airlines will pay much less for the two aircraft. It all depends on how much discount both manufacturers can provide. Considering that the Dreamliner has been in production for 3 more years, Boeing has a lot more flexibility regarding the price.

Nevertheless, Airbus has provided excellent competition for the 787 and has regained ground in the industry.

Future of the A350

With Airbus’ response to the 787, Boeing has realized they have to come up with an answer of their own – the 777X family.

With revolutionary wing-tips and an engine that is as wide as the 737, Boeing promises something that airlines are craving for – even more efficiency. According to Boeing, when comparing the 777X and the Airbus A350, the 777X promises 10% lower operating costs with even more range than Airbus’ aircraft.

While for now, Airbus has enough orders to make a profit in the near future, the next decade in the battle for the best ultra-long-haul jet will be spicy.

Airbus has teased that they plan to stretch the A350 to compete with the 777X. However, Airbus‘ own Guillaume Faury was very reluctant to provide a definitive answer regarding the capability upgrade of the A350:

Until then, we can only speculate what Airbus has in their pockets regarding the future of the A350 program. Even though airlines can debate the decision between the A350 and the 787, the 777X safely brings back Boeing into the dominant position in the long-haul wide-body market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9644123315811157}",neutral,0.9644123315811157,0
Why the Airbus A380 failed to take off - The New Economy,"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2Vjb25vbXkuY29tL3N0cmF0ZWd5L3doeS10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmFpbGVkLXRvLXRha2Utb2Zm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it was first announced in 2005, the Airbus A380 was supposed to represent the future of flying. Now, after just 12 years in service, the aircraft is being discontinued as the industry moves towards a no-frills approach

In 2005, when Virgin Atlantic placed an order for six Airbus A380 jets, Richard Branson joked that the airliners, which featured double beds and a casino, would offer customers “two ways to get lucky”, according to The New York Times. Airbus had placed its bet: as more passengers took to the skies each day, it predicted that airlines would demand larger jets as airports and routes became increasingly congested.

The aerospace manufacturer envisioned that the future of flying would be based on the ‘hub and spoke’ model, with passengers travelling between major airports and using connecting flights to reach their final destination.

Designed to compete with Boeing’s models, the A380 was never able to match the success of the 747

Fast-forward to 2019, and Airbus’ forecast has unravelled. Last year, Virgin cancelled its long-standing order of six A380s. Then, in February 2019, Emirates – the most loyal customer of the superjumbo programme – cut its order from 53 to 14 aircraft, while Qantas cancelled the delivery of its last eight A380s. This was the final nail in the coffin for the project: Airbus reluctantly announced the “painful” decision to permanently halt the A380 production line in 2021, following years of speculation regarding the model’s future. The plane that many thought would revolutionise aviation lasted just 16 years.

Efficiency is key

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Boeing made a bet of its own. Conversely to Airbus, the Seattle-based manufacturer envisioned customers flying point to point between smaller airports. As the A380 took to the skies for the first time in 2007 – just as the global financial crisis was starting to hit the pockets of operators and customers – Boeing unveiled the smaller, sleeker, more efficient Dreamliner 787 aircraft, a jet that could fly the same distance as Airbus’ jumbo on two fewer engines.

As margins were stretched, airlines struggled to afford the risks associated with jumbo jets. An aircraft that was smaller and quicker to refill was a far more appealing offer. “The A380 is an aircraft that frightens airline CFOs; the risk of failing to sell so many seats is just too high,” a senior aerospace industry source told Reuters in February. As Airbus grappled to find potential customers for its flagship craft, orders for the 787 were piling up.

“The future of aviation is being driven not by the big, established global players, but by small, low-cost start-up operators,” Martin Pugsley, Head of Financial Services at law firm DWF, told The New Economy. “These companies look to scale up quickly by offering lots of flights connecting lots of locations. To do this, they need smaller, lower-cost, fuel-efficient, single-aisle aircraft that have a quick turnaround time. The fastest-growing markets for aviation services are in the developing world, and most of these new players are following the low-cost model too.”

Airbus relied on Emirates to keep the A380 programme running. Prior to cutting its order, the Dubai-based airline had ordered a total of 162 jets (with 109 currently in operation) – nearly seven times more than the second-largest operator, Singapore Airlines (with 24). Only three other airlines have more than 10 in their fleet, while just one Chinese carrier – China Southern – operates the model. Not one American airline has made an order.

In total, there were 290 firm orders for the jet, of which 234 have been delivered – well short of Airbus’ target of 700. Analysts believe the company has only recuperated a small fraction of the estimated $20bn spent on research and development. The jet, first dreamed up in 1988 and blighted by years of delays as Airbus attempted to get it in the skies, never really took off.

Wrong place, wrong time

Many have asserted that the A380 programme was doomed to fail well before production began. Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia slated the aircraft, calling it “simply the dumbest programme of modern times” in a 2019 interview with travel blog the Points Guy. Designed to compete with Boeing’s models, the A380 was never able to match the success of Boeing’s own jumbo, the 747 – an aeroplane that came to be known as the ‘Queen of the Skies’. Boeing sold roughly 1,500 of the aircraft, with its ‘hump’ becoming the most recognisable silhouette in the sky.

However, regulations have significantly changed since the jumbo jet’s introduction more than 50 years ago. In the early days of aviation, Extended-Range Twin-Engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS) decreed that two-engine aircraft had to fly within 60 minutes of an airport in case they encountered engine issues. As technology progressed and aircraft manufacturers improved their safety records, these regulations were gradually relaxed. Today, Boeing’s 777 and 787 models are able to fly as far as five hours from the nearest airport, leaving them free to operate on effectively any route in the world and opening up new opportunities to airlines – opportunities that have crowded out the A380.

The A380 had its first test flight in 2005 – two years before the new ETOPS directive was issued. With the aircraft designed to take advantage of the previous rules, the change to regulations were a huge blow. “What we are seeing here is the end of the large, four-engined aircraft,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in February. “There has been speculation that we were 10 years too early; I think it is clear that we were 10 years too late.” The 747 was a roaring success because it entered service during a period of strict regulation, making it the only option. The A380, meanwhile, deemed a financial flop, was overwhelmed by increased competition as a result of relaxed rules.

Oversized expectations

The spaciousness of the A380 made it a favourite with passengers, while its scale made it a favourite among plane spotters. A dedicated website was set up to help passengers choose a route served by the jet, and in February 2019, The Guardian’s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham said “it felt a miracle” that this enormous plane could fly.

But in spite of this reverence, business travellers – integral to the profit margins of legacy airlines and flag carriers on long-haul routes – demonstrated an overwhelming preference for flight frequency and flexible schedules over aircraft size. Airlines found they could fly two 777s on a typical long-haul route at a lower total cost than flying one A380, making the aircraft economically uncompetitive on all but a handful of routes worldwide.

“When Airbus unveiled the prototype in 2005, its main selling point was its sheer size. Ironically, the aircraft’s size is what turned potential airline customers off,” said Pugsley. “Each unit is naturally far more expensive than smaller rival models, which meant that Airbus was operating in a small market from the very beginning.”

The limited appeal was further compounded by a lack of airport facilities capable of handling the plane. Airbus had out-engineered the airports: gates had to be refitted to accommodate a plane of such magnitude; runways had to be strengthened to cope with its weight; and even terminals had to be adjusted to ease potential passenger congestion issues stemming from the A380’s vast capacity. “When you deal with new technologies where the industry has not enough previous experience, it’s easy to underestimate the challenges during the design,” Paolo Colombo, Global Industry Director at software developer ANSYS, told The New Economy.

As one innovation meets its demise, another is born. The Boeing 777-9 is due to make its first flight later this year and, though it has just a single deck, its expected capacity of around 400 passengers near enough matches that of the A380. Further, despite having half as many engines, it can fly just as far. Equipped with folding wing tips, the jet can operate in and out of all of the world’s major airports.

With the aircraft already outstripping the A380 in terms of orders a year before its formal launch, it looks like the new ‘Triple Seven’ could be the future of aviation. But, then again, the same was once said of the A380.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9349643588066101}",neutral,0.9349643588066101,0

The news is a blow to Boeing, which has delayed its plans to produce a similar aircraft as it strives to get the 737 Max jet back in service after the fleet was grounded following two fatal crashes.

The Airbus A321XLR, an upgrade on the current A321neo, will begin flying in 2023, two years before Boeing had initially expected to introduce its own midsize plane. It is 30 percent more fuel efficient than jets currently offered by competitors, according to Netherlands-based company, and can fly up to 4,700 miles.

“Airlines will be able to operate a lower-cost single-aisle aircraft on longer and less heavily travelled routes – many of which can now only be served by larger and less efficient wide-body aircraft,” Airbus said in a statement. “This will enable operators to open new world-wide routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia.”

Carriers including JetBlue Airways have already reportedly expressed interest in the A321XLR.

At the Paris Air Show, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the Chicago-based manufacturer is continuing to evaluate whether to move forward with the expected $15 billion investment on its own competing aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration has reportedly informed Boeing it will soon begin flight trials of the software update intended to fix the issues with the Max jet.

Muilenburg acknowledged on Sunday the firm made a “mistake” in how it handled the implementation of a key safety alert that contributed to the crashes.

Airbus pushes MRTT aircraft as test bed for future aerial combat network - Defense News,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvcGFyaXMtYWlyLXNob3cvMjAxOS8wNi8xOC9haXJidXMtcHVzaGVzLW1ydHQtYWlyY3JhZnQtYXMtdGVzdC1iZWQtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1hZXJpYWwtY29tYmF0LW5ldHdvcmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus is banking on its fleet of tankers and cargo hauler to test the initial building blocks of a novel data network meant to connect all elements of the Future Combat Air System, according to company officials.

The aircraft are suited for that role because they have the space to accommodate experimental equipment, and the tests offer user nations the option of using the aircraft in a new role, executives told Defense News at the Paris Air Show.

The push to field an interconnected sensor suite is a central theme of the Franco-German-Spanish fighter program, which kicked into higher gear earlier this week with the blessing of French President Emmanuel Macron and the three partner countries’ defense ministers.

Part of the sixth-generation flavor envisioned for the FCAS program stems from the idea that a smattering of drones, sensors and manned aircraft would tackle missions together under the direction of an intelligent data backbone.

“The level of connectivity is much greater than in current systems,” David Kingdon Jones, head of airborne connectivity, communications, intelligence and security at Airbus, told Defense News in an interview.

He said engineers are no longer treating connectivity as a mere must-have to make network elements talk to one another. Instead, they believe there is a new level of capability to be unlocked if FCAS nodes can push information securely and intelligently to where it is needed in combat.

RELATED

“Connectivity currently is mostly about point-to-point,” Jones said. Infusing a true network character into the future aerial weapon, on the other hand, will bring new gains so long as the necessary breakthroughs can be achieved in increased bandwidth and security, he added.

Airbus recently announced the completion of a test series with a multirole tanker transport (MRTT) plane over Spain. The demonstration is part of the company’s effort to field what executives have dubbed the “Network for the Sky,” or NFTS. It combines communications nodes from space all the way down to soldier radios, plus 5G mobile traffic, and — in a couple of years — laser connections.

Another round of tests featuring the aircraft is planned for late 2020 or early 2021, according to Didier Plantecoste, head of MRTT and Airbus derivatives programs. The company plans to incrementally phase in new networking capabilities in what he called “baby demonstrations.”

For the most recent test in May, engineers established a multi-Mbit/s (megabit per second) data pipeline connecting a soldier on the ground with a fighter jet launched to obtain imagery of a nearby target area, which then fed the data through a chain involving the MRTT plane, a satellite layer and ground station in North America, and back to the air operations center in Europe.

According to Jones, that level of connectivity so far has been achieved only by American forces and is new for Europeans. In particular, achieving a degree of network self-management, such as selecting a fallback connection if one strand breaks down, is new for forces here, he added.

Officials acknowledge their plan for an intelligent, aerial data network has a similar ring as the U.S. military’s idea of network-centric operations that was all the rage in 1990s and the early days of the Iraq invasion. “It’s very, very similar,” Jones said.

The theory has fallen somewhat out of favor since then because American forces were so enamored with the idea of controlling the battle via sophisticated networking equipment that the advent of a decidedly low-tech weapon, the improvised explosive device, caught them flat-footed.

Airbus has an established assembly line in Mobile for its A320 family of jets. An assembly line for the A220 family, a smaller series of passenger jets designed to carry 100 to 150 people, is now under construction. The company expects to deliver its first Alabama-built A220 in mid-2020.

A photo released by Airbus doesn't provide much of a look at the first Major Component Assemblies (MCAs) to arrive in Mobile for the A220. The company said the shipment contained the aft fuselage and cockpit for the jet.

“With the arrival of these assemblies, A220 production in Mobile will shortly become a reality,” said Paul Gaskell, President of Airbus U.S. A220 Inc. “The arrival of these MCAs is taking place almost four years to the day from when our first A320 MCAs arrived. It’s amazing to see how much we’ve grown over that time, and an exciting time for Airbus, Mobile and Alabama. The team has been working very hard over the past year to make this happen, and we’re ready to get started delivering another great aircraft from Mobile.”

According to information released by Airbus, A220 production is scheduled to begin ""in the next couple of months, even as construction on some of the A220-specific buildings on the campus continues over the next year.""

The first wave of A220 employees has been training in Mirabel, Canada. The A220 was initially developed by Bombardier and built at a Bombardier facility in Mirabel, before the two companies formed a partnership to build and market the jet under the Airbus name.

Middle East Airlines orders four Airbus A321XLRs - Airbus,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNi1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1vcmRlcnMtZm91ci1haXJidXMtYTMyMXhscnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le Bourget - Middle East Airlines (MEA), the flag carrier of Lebanon, has signed a firm order for four A321XLRs, making it the launch airline customer of Airbus latest evolution of the winning A321neo family.

The agreement takes Middle East Airlines’ cumulative single aisle orders with Airbus to 15 A321neo family aircraft, including 11 A321neos and 4 A321XLRs with deliveries starting in 2020. MEA will use the A321XLR to strengthen its network in Africa and Asia.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – 15% more than the A321LR and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft. This will enable operators to open new world-wide routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, as well as further extending the Family’s non-stop reach on direct transatlantic flights between continental Europe and the Americas. For passengers, the A321XLR’s new Airspace cabin will provide the best travel experience, while offering seats in all classes with the same high-comfort as on a long-haul wide-body, with the low costs of a single-aisle aircraft.

The A320neo and its derivatives are the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft family with over 6,500 orders from some 100 customers since its launch in 2010. It has pioneered and incorporated the latest technologies, including new generation engines and the industry's reference cabin design, delivering 20% fuel cost per seat savings alone. The A320neo also offers significant environmental benefits with nearly a 50% reduction in noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft.

Airbus flight tests plane with flapping wing-tips inspired by the albatross - New Atlas,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1mbGFwcGluZy13aW5nLXBsYW5lLzYwMTYyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Taking their cues from the birds, Airbus engineers have flown a scale-model airplane that incorporates flapping wing-tips. Based on the structure of the albatross wing, the remote-controlled AlbatrossOne uses a ""semi-aeroelastic hinge"" concept that reacts to turbulence and wind gusts to minimize their effects and reduce stress on the airframe.

If you watch old newsreels online, sooner or later you're bound to come across clips of some inventor showing off an ornithopter – an airplane that flies by flapping its wings like a bird. What makes these grainy, black and white films so funny is that as the machine gyrates like a demented crow trying to take off, it remains stuck firmly to the ground until it shakes itself to bits.

But imitating the birds isn't that daft an idea. Leonardo Da Vinci's early plans for a flying machine were based on his observations of the birds, and modern engineers are still very interested in taking some tips from our feathered friends.

For example, the Airbus semi-aeroelastic hinge takes its inspiration not from the wild flapping of the crow, but the graceful soaring of the sea albatross, which can fly for thousands of miles without flapping its wings. The albatross doesn't get tired because it can lock its wing bones in place and then unlock them when it runs into a wind gust or wants to do come maneuvering.

AlbatrossOne uses a ""semi-aeroelastic hinge"" concept that reacts to turbulence and wind gusts to minimize their effects and reduce stress on the airframe Airbus

The semi-automatic hinge does something similar. Airbus says the folding wing is nothing new – aircraft carriers are full of aircraft equipped with them – but the Airbus demonstrator has freely-flapping wings that can lock and unlock in flight as air conditions change.

The demonstrator is a scaled down version of an Airbus A31 aircraft that's made out of carbon composites and glass-reinforced resins. It was developed over a 20-month period at Filton, South Gloucestershire, England, the home of the famous Concorde SST and is billed as the ""first Filton aircraft since Concorde.""

According to Airbus engineer Tom Wilson, the flapping section extends along a third of the length of the wing and is designed to react autonomously to in-flight turbulence and lessen the load on the wing at its base. This is a great weight savings because it means that the airframe doesn't need the heavily reinforced wing boxes that prevent the wings from being too stressed where they meet the fuselage.

The first test flights that concluded in February 2019 took place with the wings fully locked or unlocked from takeoff to landing. The next phase will involve unlocking the wings in flight to study the transition.

""[This is] how nature can inspire us,"" says Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus' Executive Vice-President of Engineering. ""When there is a wind gust or turbulence, the wing of a conventional aircraft transmits huge loads to the fuselage, so the base of the wing must be heavily strengthened, adding weight to the aircraft. Allowing the wing-tips to react and flex to gusts reduces the loads and allows us to make lighter and longer wings – the longer the wing, the less drag it creates up to an optimum, so there are potentially more fuel efficiencies to exploit.""

The project results were presented last week at the International Forum on Aeroelasticity and Structural Dynamics conference in Savannah, Georgia.

"Airbus unveils design for A321XLR, world’s ‘longest range’ narrow-body plane - CNN","Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXNpbmdsZS1haXNsZS1sb25nLXJhbmdlLXBsYW5lLXNjbGktaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has unveiled designs for the A321XLR – an aircraft it claims will be the world’s “longest range single-aisle airliner.”

The airliner, set to be rolled out in 2023, has an “unprecedented” long range of up to 4,700 nm (nautical miles), Airbus said. The ability of a lower cost single-aisle craft to travel such distances will allow operators to open new long haul services, particularly on less heavily traveled routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, according to the manufacturer.

The new model has 15% more range than its predecessor, the A321LR – paving the way the way for direct transatlantic flights between continental Europe and the Americas.

The plane also comes with features that Airbus hopes will improve its “environmental performance.” The manufacturer claims that it will have 20% lower fuel burn per seat, and will produce 5,000 tonnes less CO2 per year. Airbus also says that the aircraft has a noise footprint that is 50% lower for passengers and airports.

The state-of-the-art plane, 44.51 meters in length, will be able to seat between 180 and 220 passengers if operators choose to seat passengers in traditional two class seating.

Other changes to the aircraft include a new permanent rear center tank for more fuel volume and a modified landing gear for an increased maximum take-off weight of 101 metric tonnes.

“We’re giving the market what it’s asking for… the A321XLR is the longest range single aisle aircraft – available now,” said Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, in a written statement to CNN.

According to Airbus, the A320neo Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle aircraft with over 6,500 orders from more than 100 customers since its launch in 2010.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9710911512374878}",neutral,0.9710911512374878,0
"Looking to a sustainable future, and advancing digital transformation for Airbus services - Airbus","Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA2LWxvb2tpbmctdG8tYS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1mdXR1cmUtYW5kLWFkdmFuY2luZy1kaWdpdGFsLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uLWZvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ leading role in aerospace industry digital transformation is evident at this week’s Paris Air Show, where the company’s emphasis on digital-powered, cross-divisional services is as important as its exhibits of aircraft, spacecraft and other hardware. The company’s outlook on the future of aviation, with a focus on sustainability, also is reinforced with technologies and partnerships highlighted at Le Bourget Airport.

Expanding Airbus’ portfolio of military digital services: SmartForce

A service Airbus is continuing to develop, and which is in focus at the Paris Air Show, is SmartForce – the company’s digital services offering for aircraft and helicopters in military fleets. Seven new services have now been added to the existing umbrella of SmartForce, ranging from reliability analytics and maintenance planning to fleet optimisation – which was detailed by the Airbus team.

“SmartForce is a new service – launched last year – which is generating high customer interest,” explained Stephan Miegel, Head of Airbus Military Aircraft Services. “The seven products we launched at this air show will be continuously enriched in accordance with customer feedback. And there are more services to come.”

Miegel continued: “Some of the SmartForce services are the same for both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, while others differ depending on the customers and their individual needs. Customers have the opportunity to choose from the range of services we have on offer in order to maximise fleet availability and improve operational mission success.”

The SmartForce suite of services utilises data gathered by Airbus-built military aircraft and helicopters, providing intelligence whenever and wherever needed – and sharing the aggregated data between operators to increase the range and effectiveness.

A digital open-data platform with Airbus Services

In Airbus’ Paris Air Show display area, Airbus Services is presenting for the first time its new “Flight Hour maintenance Services powered by Skywise” – the company’s open-data platform of reference for all major aerospace players. The new service will identify required parts for customers’ aircraft, locate the nearest worldwide logistics centre where these parts are stored, and track their delivery to customers, to be provided at the right time. Powered by Skywise, Flight Hour Services can be used directly by airlines’ maintenance control centres or by Airbus for its full FHS service on all Airbus aircraft.

Since launching Skywise at the 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus has progressed from four “early adopter” airlines to 80-plus operators, growing from a few hundred aircraft supplying data for the platform to more than 6,000 today, according to Marc Fontaine, Head of Airbus’ Digital Transformation Office. There are over 10,000 unique monthly users on the Skywise platform, involving airlines, suppliers and users within Airbus.

Airbus’ evolution of the Skywise offer includes the Paris Air Show announcement of the first Skywise digital services for the leasing community, with CDB Aviation and CALC signing up as the initial customers.

Skywise provides all users with one secure, cloud-based platform for aviation data that is aggregated and anonymised, and which is enriched from multiple sources across the industry – including airline operators and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The more data that airlines and OEMs share in the Skywise Core platform, the more accurate the predictions and models for the connected users.

By adopting Skywise, airlines will benefit from a “supercharged” and ever-evolving digital platform, enabling operating efficiencies, savings and revenue opportunities which are achieved by reducing operational interruptions, burning less fuel, operating more efficiently, reducing workload and leaving room for third-party services (mostly in maintenance).

An exponential growth for the Skywise services platform

Fontaine said the exponential growth of Skywise users underscores how fast digital transformation is advancing in aviation. “This shows how an industry that many people expected to be a late adopter of digital technologies can take the lead…or could be subject to disruption if it does not accept the revolution that is happening.”

The digital transformation process was a major challenge for Airbus, according to Fontaine, who noted “there is no textbook on how to apply digital transformation to industrial systems such as aerospace and aviation.”

In reviewing Airbus’ digital transformation to date, Fontaine said one of the lessons learned was that multiple “digital foundations” are needed to be put in place, including information management (IM) and data governance.

Fontaine explained that the transformation of information management is essential, as companies such as Airbus were previously focussed on the core capabilities of engineering, manufacturing and supply. “While IM was a more ‘remote’ support function in the past, it is becoming blended in everything we do today – from design and manufacturing to services – so we need to completely transform the profile and pre-eminence of our IM departments,” he explained.

Data governance also is vital, Fontaine added, especially for the Skywise services platform – as it gathers data from the airline operators and suppliers, as well as from within Airbus. “Data governance involves issues ranging from who owns the data and who gives access rights to how we share it with the airlines, and when suppliers can access the data,” he said. “Dealing with data governance is a huge challenge, requiring a tremendous effort to put policies in place, and to ensure the proper execution of these policies.”

Expanding the reach of Airbus’ services portfolio

Other services programme updates announced during the Paris Air Show include Airbus’ integration of the A220 programme – its newest single-aisle jetliner family member – into its Customer Support & Services network. On the new business side, Chilean low-cost carrier SKY Airline was identified as the launch customer for the new Airbus Chile Training Centre; completion of the first A380 full-cabin retrofit for Singapore Airlines, performed collaboratively by SIA Engineering Company and Airbus Services, was introduced at the show as well.

“Services are core to the Airbus strategy, optimising the aircraft operations until dismantling and improving efficiency throughout the full life cycle,” Rémi Maillard, Head of Services by Airbus, explained to the media during a press conference.

E-Fan X: building the future of aviation today

The aviation industry is moving towards zero-emission flight – and one area of focus for Airbus E-Fan X, a hybrid-electric flight demonstrator project, which was a topic of discussion during the Paris Air Show. Expected to make its first flight in 2021, this testbed will mark an important step in Airbus’ electrification journey.

Using a BAe146-RJ100 airliner as the testbed platform, programme teams will remove one of its four turbofan jet engines, replacing it with a 2-MW electric motor accompanied by a serial hybrid electric propulsion architecture. By maturing the technology, performance, safety and reliability of this testbed, Airbus, along with its partner Rolls-Royce, is accelerating progress on hybrid-electric technology – exploring such challenges of high-power propulsion systems as thermal effects, electric thrust management, altitude and dynamic effects on electric systems, and electromagnetic compatibility issues.

E-Fan X is an evolution of Airbus’ strategy to advance the state of more-electric aviation, and follows its well-known E-Fan demonstrator – which performed a pioneering crossing of the English Channel in 2015. By stepping up from the small, two-seat E-Fan to the E-Fan X, Airbus is increasing the onboard power levels from kilowatts to megawatts.

Airbus Helicopters and Safran Helicopter Engines team up for sustainability

In other news during Day 3 of the Paris Air Show, Airbus Helicopters and Safran Helicopter Engines announced plans to team up in exploring the potential for more sustainable vertical flight. The two companies are seeking to jointly demonstrate future technologies that will help reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions, while continuing to improve safety. Among the options the team will be exploring are: electric-hybrid flight, biofuels, along with advanced engine architectures.

“Together with Safran, we want to grow the trend and continue to lead the industry in welcoming innovative solutions to progress on reducing emissions in terms of noise and fuel consumption,” Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO, told reporters during a joint press conference.

Continuous popularity of single-aisle aircraft

Airbus Commercial Aircraft were back in the news at the Paris Air Show today, with its single-aisle aircraft family order book continuing to grow. Announcements included the A321XLR version (officially launched Monday at the Paris Air Show) receiving 50 orders from Indigo Partners; while American Airlines also booked 50 aircraft of the type (30 of which will be converted from the carrier’s existing order for A321neos); Qantas Airways Limited converted 26 of its existing A320neo Family orders into the A321XLR version, and booked 10 additional A321XLRs.

Other NEO (new engine option) members of the A320 Family also remain popular with airlines, with Accipiter Holdings announcing the signing of a Purchase Agreement with Airbus for 20 A320neo aircraft – while China Airlines signed a Memorandum of Agreement for 11 A321neo jetliners, with another 14 on lease.

Rome to New York in a narrowbody jet? Airbus launches a lean new plane for long flights - CNBC,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWJldHMtb24tc21hbGxlci1qZXRzLWZvci1sb25nLWZsaWdodHMtd2l0aC1uZXctYTMyMXhsci5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTkvMDYvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWJldHMtb24tc21hbGxlci1qZXRzLWZvci1sb25nLWZsaWdodHMtd2l0aC1uZXctYTMyMXhsci5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing 747 jumbo jet that started flying half a century ago opened up so many destinations that it became known as the plane that shrank the world. Now a rival manufacturer wants to shrink the planes.

Airbus on Monday announced plans to build an extended-range version of its single-aisle A321 jet, a bet on expanding what its line of leaner planes can do and that travelers and airlines will warm to flying a narrowbody aircraft on trips that could be longer than eight hours.

The new Airbus A321XLR, would have a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles that could let it link cities like New York and Rome or Tokyo and Sydney. Airbus plans to increase the range by 15% compared with its standard long-range A321, which JetBlue Airways in April said it would use for its first service to London in 2021.

The plane marks a shift for Airbus and commercial flight shifting toward smaller, nimbler aircraft. Airbus earlier this year announced it will end production of the A380, the world's largest passenger plane, as demand for the 500-passenger plane faltered and airlines' appetite for leaner aircraft rose.

Airbus' announcement comes as its main competitor, Boeing, is hobbled by the crisis surrounding two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes, aircraft that have been grounded worldwide since mid-March. Boeing has been mulling an all-new twin-aisle plane that would be smaller than its 787s but larger than its 737s.

Airbus argues that its plane could serve carriers who want to fill it with 180 to 220 passengers in two cabins, but don't want to have the expense of operating a wide-body plane, which would have more seats to fill. The company expects the planes to be delivered in 2023.

""You can use a narrowbody, a single-aisle plane going long distances and you can connect cities that had no possibility of connections with a good business case,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC in an interview on Monday following the announcement.

Faury said he wasn't concerned that controversy over Boeing's regulatory approval process for the 737 Max could bring more scrutiny of Airbus' new plane.

""That might be good news,"" he said. ""That's the way to raise the level of safety.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999472439289093}",neutral,0.999472439289093,0
Airbus “goes the distance” with its jetliner families and readies a new chapter in European defence - Airbus,"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1nb2VzLXRoZS1kaXN0YW5jZS13aXRoLWl0cy1qZXRsaW5lci1mYW1pbGllcy1hbmQtcmVhZGllcy1hLW5ldy1jaGFwdGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus recapped its Paris Air Show achievements on the event’s final fully professional day, underscoring strong endorsements for its jetliner families – including the newly-launched A321XLR (extra-long range) version; marking a major industrial milestone for Europe’s Future Air Combat System; and reinforcing Airbus Corporate Helicopters’ Chinese market presence with this country’s launch customer for the ACH160 rotorcraft.

Speaking to reporters at Le Bourget Airport, Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury and Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said Airbus’ new business announced this week for a total of 383 aircraft (along with 375 conversions of existing aircraft orders) was a clear endorsement of the company’s jetliner families’ product strategy – supported by a very vibrant market.

“The number of orders and commitments received, along with the number and diversity of airlines and lessors, serves as a strong endorsement of our product strategy,” Scherer added, as demonstrated by the new business for both the single-aisle A320 product line and the new wide-body A330neo.

The single-aisle aircraft’s growing popularity

The extra-long-range single-aisle A321XLR made headlines with its official launch at the air show, followed by announcements of 48 orders and 89 commitments, as well as 112 conversions from existing A321neo bookings to the A321XLR version through the air show’s fourth day.

With an extended range of up to 4,700 nm, the A321XLR is the newest member of the A320neo Family and the next evolutionary step for Airbus’ single-aisle product line, responding to market needs for even more range and payload, generating more value for operators – while offering an enhanced passenger experience with the “Airspace by Airbus” cabin.

Other A320 Family members received 127 orders and commitments through today. “These results show the continuous interest in Airbus single-aisle aircraft despite an already-very solid order book and commitments out to 2024,” elaborated Scherer. “We are receiving endorsements from all market segments, including lessors, low-cost carriers as well as mainstream carriers.”

Airbus’ latest addition to its single-aisle product line – the A220 – won new business for 85 aircraft, further demonstrating customers’ interest in the efficient jetliners that are purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market. CEO Faury noted that the A220 made its first Paris Air Show appearance as a member of the Airbus commercial aircraft product lineup, with an airBaltic A220-300 on display.

Market-leading wide-bodies: two aircraft, four sizes

The week’s orders also reconfirmed the continuing popularity of Airbus’ wide-body A330, paced by the latest version – the A330neo, which gained a combined total of 24 orders and commitments in the longer-fuselage A330-900 configuration.

Reinforcing the A330neo’s market appeal is the aircraft family’s commonality with the Airbus’ A350 XWB, constituting the most modern and efficient wide-body product line. Its four members (the A330-800 and A330-900, along with the A350-900 and A350-1000) provide four optimally sized wide-body aircraft with seating capacities from 220 to 410 passengers and a range of more than 7,000 nm. They benefit from the latest propulsion technology and aerodynamic enhancements, while also providing an exclusive passenger experience with the modern “Airspace by Airbus” cabin, plus cockpit commonality for pilots.

The attributes of Airbus’ A330neo/A350 XWB wide-body jetliners were cited by Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss when the carrier announced its order this week for 14 A330-900s, with options for six more – supporting its fleet renewal and expansion. “In addition to providing a 13% fuel reduction from our current A330-200 and A330-300 fleet, the A330neo operates with lower noise and has the commonality advantage with our A350 XWBs,” Weiss said. “This decision was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that sets the airline on a path for growth.”

A350 XWB technology applied to the A330neo includes the Rolls-Royce Trent family new engines and the latest aerodynamic features, such as new composite sharklets. The A330neo also benefits from proven profitability, exceptional operational flexibility on sectors from 30 min. up to 17 hrs. and 99.5% operational reliability of the A330, which has over 1,400 aircraft in service all over the world.

Looking into the future with FCAS

The Paris Air Show also served as the venue for a major European defence milestone, with Airbus and Dassault Aviation delivering their first Demonstrator Phase industrial proposal for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS). While briefing reporters, Guillaume Faury underscored the significant progress made during the show, “We are very happy to see Spain’s decision to join the French and German initiative and the partnership we have with Dassault being reinforced and going to the next step of the programme,” he told journalists.

The FCAS is a network-based, information-centric combat system that includes a new fighter aircraft and Remote Carriers (RCs). Bruno Fichefeux, the FCAS head at Airbus, said the programme must develop technologies that will be viable in 2040 and beyond – making the system that is open, flexible and adaptable to future upgrades and advancements.

Airbus Helicopters expands international partnerships

In other Paris Air Show activity, Airbus Helicopters announced that Shenzhen Eastern General Aviation Company has signed an agreement for an ACH160 – becoming the launch customer for this helicopter type in China. The ACH160 is a member of the Airbus Corporate Helicopters product line – and a variant of Airbus Helicopters’ innovative medium twin-engine rotorcraft designed to create added value for customers in performance, economic competitiveness, safety and comfort.

Additionally, Airbus Helicopters will explore potential cooperation projects with Turkish Aerospace, per a Memorandum of Understanding signed by Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even and Turkish Aerospace President/CEO Prof. Dr. Temel Kotil.

Connectivity onboard, and across platforms

Another Airbus focus at the Paris Air Show was connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT). Connectivity already is changing lives on Earth – and as these technologies are increasingly being used on aircraft, aviation is benefitting from connectivity across platforms, making the industry safer and more efficient.

With a unique experience that crosses the domains of aircraft, satellites and secure military communications, Airbus is working on harmonising platform connectivity and developing interoperable communication solutions. These solutions can be applied to such diverse platforms as jetliners, helicopters, drones, future VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, satellites, command centres and mobile units deployed on the ground or at sea.

For connectivity in the air transport sector, Airbus aims to offer the same seamless experience aloft that people have with their mobile phones and devices on the ground – but with the reliability and cybersecurity standards of the aviation industry.

Airbus envisions using connectivity to enhance the passenger experience, while also keeping cabin personnel and flight crews informed of the on-board status – literally from nose to tail. Called the “Connected Experience by Airbus,” it includes such applications as real-time tracking of baggage loading in overhead bins while passengers embark, improving galley monitoring to track food and beverage stocks, performing predictive maintenance through the remote monitoring of lavatories, along with keeping watch on premium-class seats to ensure their functionality and signal problems in case of malfunctions.

An additional benefit of these technologies is improved operational efficiency, as faster data speeds will enable jetliners to gather and share more in-flight information with other aircraft, as well as ground teams and the air traffic system.

Underpinning this new era of connectivity is Skywise, which the company is evolving to serve as aerospace’s data platform of reference. With flexible and visual tools, Skywise enables airlines to store, access, manage and analyse data more efficiently while also benchmarking against other airline users’ trends.

"Airbus founding father and visionary, Roger Béteille, passes away - aviator.aero","Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL2FpcmJ1cy1mb3VuZGluZy1mYXRoZXItYW5kLXZpc2lvbmFyeS1yb2dlci1iZXRlaWxsZS1wYXNzZXMtYXdheS_SAWJodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmF2aWF0b3IuYWVyby9haXJidXMtZm91bmRpbmctZmF0aGVyLWFuZC12aXNpb25hcnktcm9nZXItYmV0ZWlsbGUtcGFzc2VzLWF3YXkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 25 June 2019 – Airbus is saddened that one of its founding fathers, Roger Béteille, who not only shaped Airbus’ first commercial aircraft - the A300B - but also Airbus Industrie, passed away on 14 June at the age of 97.

Born in Aveyron, France, in 1921, Roger Béteille studied at Supaéro in Toulouse before joining France’s SNCASE, which later became Sud Aviation, in 1943. He received his pilot’s licence in 1945, becoming thereafter flight test engineer in 1952. He was part of the flight test team on the Caravelle’s first flight.

In July 1967, the idea to develop a 300-seater all new wide-body twinjet was progressing and Mr Béteille was appointed chief engineer for the A300 programme at Sud Aviation. It soon became clear that launch customers Air France and Lufthansa wanted a smaller product.

So, in early 1968 Mr Béteille started work in secret on what would become the A300B, a 250 seater with a hold large enough to accommodate two standard containers side by side. The innovative fuselage cross-section he designed is still in use today on the A330.

Known as ‘the man with the white tie’, it was Béteille, along with Airbus’ first production director Felix Kracht, who drew up the workshare which forms the basis of Airbus’ European production system that still defines the company today. “I wanted to use all the available talents and capacities to their utmost without worrying about the colour of the flag or what language was spoken,” he said at the time. He extended this approach to creating a multinational flight test team. The A300B was formally lauched in 1969.

When the Airbus Industrie grouping of economic interests (GIE) was created in 1970, Roger Béteille, now senior vice president of engineering, pushed for its headquarters to be close to the final assembly line in Toulouse, so potential customers could see the product under construction.

By the time the A300B made its first flight on 28 October 1972, Béteille had gained a strong understanding of airlines’ needs, something he put to good use during a decade-long campaign to gain customers. Despite the lean years that followed the OPEC oil crisis, his efforts culminated in the A300’s first US customer - Eastern Airlines - in 1977.

Eastern was led by the former Commander of Apollo 8, Frank Borman, with whom Roger Béteille built a strong relationship.

From the very start, Roger Béteille nurtured a dream: to found an aircraft family. “I was convinced that Airbus would never take off with a single aircraft,” he explained. “Potential customers would wonder if we’d still be around in ten or 20 years’ time.”

His dream truly came to fruition towards the end of his career, when in March 1984 he managed the formal launch of the A320.

Roger Béteille was instrumental in developing its fly-by-wire (FBW) controls, with increased flight safety and wider fuselage, all of which were key to its huge commercial success. Fly-by-wire also enabled the start of cockpit commonality and cross-crew qualification for pilots across Airbus aircraft.

Saudi Arabian Airlines, the kingdom's national airline, said Tuesday it had ordered 65 A320neo-type aircraft from Airbus, worth more than $7.4 billion at list prices, giving an early boost to the European manufacturer at the Paris Air Show.

The deal is part of Saudi Arabian Airlines' plans to boost its A320neo fleet to up to 100 aircraft from 35 now.

It includes 15 aircraft of the new A321 XLR type, capable of flying distances up to 8,700 kilometres (5,400 miles).

Of the total 65 orders, 35 are still options.

""Passenger demand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is experiencing strong growth on domestic, regional and international routes. The additional aircraft will be deployed to support the national carrier's plan to boost capacity,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The French aerospace bonanza is traditionally a key theatre for rivals Airbus and Boeing to clock up orders, and this year Boeing entered the race handicapped by the fallout from crashes of two of its 737 MAX aircraft that together killed 346 people.

But in a surprise announcement Tuesday, British Airways owner International Airlines Group said it had signed a letter of intent with Boeing for delivery of 200 planes of the 737 MAX type.

""We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators,"" IAG CEO Willie Walsh said.

IAG is getting a 'substantial discount' on the 737 MAX model which is in deep trouble after two fatal crashes

IAG said the aircraft would be used by a number of its airlines including Vueling, LEVEL, and British Airways at London Gatwick airport.

Boeing said IAG, whose single-aisle fleet is currently made up almost exclusively of Airbus A320 aircraft, was turning to the 737 MAX ""as part of diversifying its future fleet to spur competition"".

If Tuesday's deal is converted into a firm order, it would be worth $24 billion according to list prices, but IAG said it had negotiated ""a substantial discount"".

Airbus's neo line comprises aircraft with new engines designed to use 15 percent less fuel than the previous generation.

Airbus also signed a letter of intent with low-cost Philippines airline Cebu Pacific to deliver 31 aircraft, of which 16 are A330neos, 10 A321 XLRs and 5 A320neos.

The A321 XLR models are to allow the airline to offer direct flights from the Philippines to India and Australia, Airbus said.

Also at the Paris Air Show, US leasing company Air Lease Corp announced a letter of intent to buy 27 Airbus A321 XLRs, Virgin ordered 14 long-haul aircraft of the A300-900 family and Delta ordered five A220-100s.

Based on Daher’s TBM platform, this project, kick-started by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council) with support from DGAC (the French Civil Aviation Authority), will develop technologies that boost the environmental efficiency of aircraft and meet the future needs of the air travel industry.

The aviation industry as a whole is committed to the development of cleaner aviation.

The overall approach spans 3 areas of research and development:

The distributed hybrid propulsion system will be provided by Safran;

Airbus will have responsibility for the aerodynamic optimisation of the distributed propulsion system, the installation of high energy density batteries and the use of those batteries to power the aircraft;

Component and systems installation, flight testing, overall analysis and regulatory construction will be undertaken by Daher using its TBM platform.

The purpose of this three-way collaboration is to validate technologies designed to reduce CO2 emissions, noise pollution, and create new uses for air transportation.

“Reducing the environmental impact of aircraft is a priority for the industry as a whole. So it is with enthusiasm and determination that we welcome the opportunity to be part of this unique partnership alongside Airbus and Safran to succeed in the ambitious challenge set by CORAC. We are determined to make it a distinctive feature of the French aviation industry, and are certain that all stakeholders will unite around it,” said Nicolas Orance, SVP Aerospace and Defense BU at Daher.

Safran will supply the entire EcoPulseTM distributed hybrid propulsion system (excluding batteries), consisting of a turbogenerator (a combined turbine and power generator), an electric power management system and integrated electric thrusters (or e-Propellers) including electric motors and propellers. The electric thrusters will be integrated into the EcoPulseTM wing and will provide propulsion thrust, at the same time as delivering aerodynamic gains (reducing wing surface area and wingtip marginal vortices, and therefore drag).

The installation of a distributed propulsion system on a TBM aircraft is an exciting opportunity to boost its efficiency, diversify its missions, reduce its environmental footprint and cut its operating costs.

“Safran has developed a technology roadmap for the installation of electric thrusters on aircraft. EcoPulseTM offers us an excellent opportunity to evaluate and identify the specific features expected by this market, particularly in terms of new hybrid propulsion aircraft projects. Safran intends to position itself as the market leader in this type of propulsion system by 2025,” said Stéphane Cueille, Head of R&T and Innovation at Safran.

Airbus will be involved in the aerodynamic modeling of the demonstrator, both to support configuration choices and to enable the development of flight control laws. All these considerations should make it possible to demonstrate the benefits of distributed propulsion, and provide the baselines for the design of optimised distributed propulsion aircraft in terms of methods, tools and outcomes.

“This distributed hybrid propulsion demonstrator is a very important step towards preparing the certification standards for a more electric aircraft. It also gives us the opportunity to improve our simulation models and consider their use on larger aircraft,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President Engineering at Airbus.

Airbus prepares for A321XLR launch - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNi8xNC9haXJidXMtcHJlcGFyZXMtZm9yLWEzMjF4bHItbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Adding to their lineup of A320neo Family aircraft, Airbus is reportedly preparing for the launch of their A321XLR during the Paris Airshow next week.

Initially reported by Jon Ostrower from The Air Current who secured four sources familiar with the matter, Airbus is set to launch the aircraft with a mixture of new commitments, including from one U.S. based airline, and conversions from other aircraft from existing customers.

Airbus A320neo

During my time at the 2019 Airbus Innovation Days in May, questions around the A321XLR or a longer range A321 to compete with Boeing’s NMA study occasionally flew towards Airbus executives, however were returned with limited answers.

Although Airbus hasn’t listed any technical specifications for the proposed aircraft, the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is slated to be 101-103t compared to the 97t of the A321LR.

Paired with reinforced landing gear, an enlarged center fuel tank and the rumored wing upgrade, the aircraft is believed to have a range of 4500-4700 nautical miles carrying 206-220 passengers.

Airbus A321 LR Infographic

Additionally, Flight Global reports Airbus might step away from the conventional A320 Family cockpit and incorporate the latest technology found on the A350 XWB.

The amount of media attention the proposed jet is receiving isn’t surprising given the thoughts airlines are expressing on the type. Here are some airlines expressing interesting in the upgraded model:

American Airlines

JetBlue

LEVEL

United Airlines

Icelandair

AirAsia

Jetstar Australia

Qantas

Indigo Partners

What stands out is the tier of potential customers involved. None of these airlines/equity firms are small players. Airbus plans to launch the jet with 300 commitments for the type so if these are the airlines potentially involved, Airbus is in for a good show.

As Boeing continues to battle their 737 MAX woes, their show is likely to be an effort to rebuild public trust and ensure their customers stick with their aircraft, with a slide of widebody announcements.

However, regarding the A321XLR, the hopeful announcement of the NMA or Boeing “797” is now unlikely as the manufacturer continues to study a market case and focus resources where needed.

Boeing 737 MAX 10

Though with all this attention from critical airlines from all over the world, will Boeing end up in the position they were in a few years ago where the A320neo launch absolutely shredded them, forcing them to build the 737 MAX? Will Boeing be forced to commit to a new aircraft? Will it be too late?

These are all questions that will be answered during the 2019 Paris Airshow and the future announcements tied to the show.

Airbus' 24cm problem with popularizing the ten-abreast A350 - - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvYWlyYnVzLTI0Y20tcHJvYmxlbS13aXRoLXBvcHVsYXJpemluZy10aGUtdGVuLWFicmVhc3QtYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the absence of the A380 at the upper range of its future aircraft plans, Airbus’ push to compare a 400-passenger A350-1000 with a 400-passenger Boeing 777X as its high-capacity offering is, it seems, based on requiring ten-abreast seating that the airframer initially pegged at 16.4”, but is now promising as 17”.

Following an Airbus pre-briefing in advance of the Paris Air Show, this push is so far relying on substantial confusion, a firm lack of detail, and what felt like obfuscation around the competition between the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 777X.

At its Innovation Days media summit in Toulouse last month, Scherer (and other Airbus executives) teased the airframer’s work to densify the A350’s economy class, promising a more palatable ten-abreast configuration than the 16.4” seat width that the A350 3-4-3 layout was initially calculated to give.

Praising the A350 in Paris, Scherer said, “when you fly long ranges at up to 8,000 miles, when you fly 350-400 people up to 8,000 miles, that’s where the economic difference from new technology becomes very, very perceptible — for the airline, for the airline CEO on the bottom line, and for the passenger in the cabin. I just sat the other day on the ultra-long-range flight from Los Angeles to Singapore. I came out of that A350 flight feeling absolutely great. It sounds esoteric, perhaps, but the cabin experience of a brand new A350 with the air quality, the cabin pressure altitude, and the noise level of the airplane makes a huge difference.”

Far be it for Runway Girl Network to get ‘esoteric’ about cabins, but Scherer will, of course, have been at least in premium economy and more likely business class on that Singapore Airlines flight, which does not offer an economy class product on the route — let alone an ultra-narrow ten-abreast one.

In what was one of his most controversial statements of the evening, Scherer continued, stating that “quantitatively, the A350-1000, 400 passengers, will fly a good solid 400 people, full of cargo, deep from inside Asia, deep into America. That airplane, when it takes off with its full load out of Asia, will take off 45 tonnes lighter than its equivalent competing aircraft.”

In answer to RGN’s question about whether this 45t (consisting, Scherer said, of 35t lighter weight and thus 10t less fuel) and 400-passenger configuration included the need to operate ten-abreast seating, Scherer noted that “the short answer to your question is: ten-abreast vs ten-abreast, the A350 is unbeatable.”

This is not surprising: an airplane substantially shorter (73.79m compared with 76.72m of the 777-9X) and narrower than another airplane should indeed be lighter.

Based on the A350’s fuselage width of 5.96m and the 777-9’s fuselage width of 6.2m, the difference between fuselage widths is 24cm (9.45 inches), or 2.4cm per passenger in ten abreast seating, if Boeing and Airbus can do similar work on sidewalls.

As for 400 seats, this looks to be complicated as well. While airframer “typical configurations” are often unrealistic, the sort of longhaul configurations of the -1000 seen so far are Qatar Airways (46 business plus 281 economy for a total of 327) and Cathay Pacific (46 business plus 32 premium economy and 256 economy for a total of 334).

Rumored configurations from other longhaul carriers look similar, with regular economy looking to be around Cathay’s 30 rows or Qatar’s 32. Adding a seat in each row gets the layout thus to some 360-odd seats. Perhaps one might imagine the Qatar example without the two rows of Qsuites after doors 2, but even so, there are few airlines willing to eschew the profitability of premium economy these days.

“This symbolic statement I made is in your typical configurations, but you’re right, the 777 is slightly larger,” Scherer admitted in response to RGN. “We are having a number of initiatives that we can demonstrate now giving airlines the opportunity to put 17” seats ten abreast across the A350, allowing it to be just as large in terms of passenger capacity as the 9X. That makes it uncatchable.”

While RGN is by no means unfamiliar with the advances in seating and monument ergonomics and kinematics to carve out extra space within the cabins, a 2.4cm per passenger difference is enormous and requires detailed justification to be taken as read. Despite multiple requests from RGN, Airbus has not supplied any further details of how it plans to create 24cm of room within the A350’s fuselage.

Le Bourget, Airbus Helicopters, the world’s largest civil helicopter manufacturer, and Safran Helicopter Engines, the global leader in helicopter turbines, are teaming up to prepare the future of cleaner, quieter and more efficient vertical flight, ahead of the upcoming Horizon Europe research programme which should be carried out during the next decade.

A Letter of Intent (LoI) was signed at the Paris Air Show between the two companies which formalised their willingness to jointly demonstrate future technologies that will significantly contribute to the reduction of CO 2 emissions and sound levels for future vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) platforms. A number of technological streams will be investigated, including various levels of electrification, higher-efficiency gas turbines or alternative fuels, as well as advanced engine architectures to further reduce the acoustic footprint of turbines.

“We are on the verge of a green revolution in our industry, and as the world’s largest civil helicopter manufacturer I believe it is our responsibility to advance technologies and solutions that will continue to make vertical flight the best choice to connect cities and carry passengers safely in urban environments,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “This future cooperation with Safran Helicopter Engines will ensure that we are in the best position to leverage and mature new propulsion methods that will support the development of cleaner and quieter helicopter platforms. The Horizon Europe programme is the ideal solution to pull skills and know-how from across Europe, and I strongly believe in its ability to drive long-lasting change in our industry.”

Airbus Helicopters and Safran Helicopter Engines have worked for years on the development of advanced propulsion solutions, including most recently an innovative electrically-powered “eco mode” enabling the pausing and restarting of a gas turbine in flight on twin-engine helicopters. This technology, which will generate fuel savings and increase range, will be tested on the Racer high-speed demonstrator, developed in the frame of the Clean Sky 2 European research programme.

Franck Saudo, President of Safran Helicopter Engines, said: “This future cooperation with Airbus in the frame of the Horizon Europe programme is a great opportunity to prepare propulsion systems for future helicopters. Today, Safran is the most capable provider of integrated and efficient propulsive systems, with the widest gas turbine power range and a complete range of electric systems for hybrid electric propulsive solutions, in addition to strong testing, qualification and certification expertise. We are very pleased to partner with Airbus Helicopters in this journey for a lower environmental footprint of air transport.”

Airbus' 4700nm A321XLR asks serious narrowbody PaxEx questions - - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvYWlyYnVzLTQ3MDBubS1hMzIxeGxyLWFza3Mtc2VyaW91cy1uYXJyb3dib2R5LXBheGV4LXF1ZXN0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fifty years ago, the original Boeing 747-100 featured a maximum range of 4,620nm. Today at the Paris Air Show, Airbus unveiled the A321XLR, an even longer range version of its stretched A320neo family member, with a range of 4,700nm, up from 4,000nm on the previous A321LR version. The step change for narrowbody aircraft is immense, and the A321XLR was launched with a confident order for twenty-seven aircraft from the bellwether Stephen Udvar-Hazy at Air Lease Corporation.

The differences from the existing A321 are few: an integrated rear centre fuel tank plus the auxiliary centre tank system of the A321LR, upgraded landing gear, and new flaps, but the basic aircraft is the A321neo, including the Cabin Flex options that enable either high-premium, high-capacity or indeed a mix of both.

Airbus will deliver the A321XLR from 2023, and many airlines still looking to make a decision on how they will address the lower to middle of the “middle of the market” space will be asking themselves whether they take an already-certified aircraft with an engine that has already gone through the seemingly inevitable teething issues, available now for delivery four years hence, or whether they will wait for the Boeing NMA, the anticipated small twin-aisle currently in stasis as Boeing’s focus remains on apologizing for the 737 MAX and looking to return it to the sky.

So what does it mean for passenger experience if a flight like New York to Istanbul or London to Beijing (both currently 9h40m nonstop) ends up on a single-aisle aircraft? There was a surprising amount of criticism at the idea of spending so much time in a narrowbody aircraft around the Paris Air Show and especially in response online.

Certainly, there are valid criticisms: the A321 is slower than most widebodies, as RGN’s In Conversation podcast guest Howard Slutsken noted this month. If airlines choose to underprovision lavatories, too, this is a problem, as is the lack of any requirement from regulators to provision lavatories for people with reduced mobility. (The much-criticized Space-Flex combo galley-lav, for all its faults, does at least offer PRM access.)

The A321neo also lacks the lower cabin altitude of some new widebodies like the 787 and A350 — which does not, it must be said, exist on the existing 777, A330, 747 or 767 families, which make up the vast majority of widebody flying, including some of the world’s longest routes.

But many passengers will also see many benefits to the A321XLR.

Let’s take purely the route aspect for a start. The A321XLR is not made for the kind of trunk routes where we currently see large widebodies operating frequently. It may well replace some — TAP Air Portugal has swapped a twice-weekly A330-200 between Porto and Newark for six weekly A321LR flights already, and is eyeing the A321XLR — but that’s likely to be an overall benefit.

New routes that are uneconomic with widebodies can also be opened up. If the options for, say, Berlin to Boston or Shanghai are a connection at one of the European megahubs including a cramped regional jet or IFE-free narrowbody mainline aircraft, a long hike, a wait and then a second flight, or a simple nonstop with a longhaul-quality aircraft, perhaps with entertainment, which is the better overall passenger experience?

A narrowbody done well can also be very popular, and with the Airspace cabin with larger bins and updated design doing it well will be easier than ever.

Compare the passenger experience on board, say, a Delta 767-300ER and a JetBlue Mint A321 between JFK and LAX, or most United pre-Polaris (especially the ‘domestic’ 777 fleet) and many passengers would take JetBlue in either its Mint business or roomy economy.

Your journalist recalls with fondness the sweet spot of the OpenSkies 757 fleet that used to shuttle between Paris and New York, with big comfortable premium economy cradle sleepers in a 2-2 layout that were far superior to any other premium economy offering across the Atlantic, and with the added benefit of landing aboard a smaller aircraft to avoid massive immigration queues, a big plus internationally.

Moreover, compared with many modern widebodies, especially the Boeing 777 in its now-usual ten-abreast configuration, or the Boeing 787 in its usual 3-3-3 layout, the A321XLR will have substantially wider seats, just as wide as its A330 stablemate.

Yes, some airlines will cheap out and squeeze the seats in. But new competition means passengers have choice getting from A to B, whether via C or nonstop — and it generally also means cheaper fares. As we’ve seen so many times, for many travelers that’s their favorite kind of passenger experience.

Saudi Arabian Airlines to boost A320neo Family fleet up to 100 - Airbus,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNi1zYXVkaS1hcmFiaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLWJvb3N0LWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LWZsZWV0LXVwLXRvLTEwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le Bourget – Saudi Arabian Airlines, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, has decided to expand its existing A320neo Family order from 35 to as many as 100 NEO aircraft including 35 options. The additional firm order takes SAUDIA’s order of A320neo Family aircraft to 65 of which 15 are A321XLRs.

The agreement was announced at the Paris Air Show by His Excellency Eng. Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser, Director General of Saudi Arabian Airlines Corporation and Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.



Passenger demand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is experiencing strong growth on domestic, regional and international routes. The additional aircraft will be deployed to support the national carrier’s plan to boost capacity. Airbus and SAUDIA have also agreed to further expand their partnership with the development of technical training, maintenance and other services.



SAUDIA is the biggest Airbus operator in the Kingdom and currently operates a portfolio of 100 Airbus aircraft comprising A320ceo Family and A330ceo. This latest purchase is in line with the Group’s Transformation Program, which includes the establishment and growth of a dual-brand strategy of operating airlines catering to the different customer segments in the Kingdom, the region and beyond.



The A320neo and its derivative aircraft Family members are the world’s best-selling single aisle aircraft with over 6,500 orders from more than 100 customers. It incorporates an industry-leading cabin design and latest generation engines, delivering 20% fuel savings alone. The A320neo also offers also a 50% reduction in noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft.

AirAsia

Starting with AirAsia, the airline announced its decision to convert 253 Airbus A320neo aircraft to the larger A321neo variant in response to the increasing demand around their network.

According to Airbus’ media release, AirAsia has placed total orders for 592 A320 Family aircraft. After this up-sizing, AirAsia’s backlog with Airbus includes 353 A321neo.

AirAsia were reportedly in talks for the A321XLR, no discussion has been presented by Airbus. It’s unknown if the order breakdown will comprise of A321 sub-variants.

Saudi Arabian Airlines

Saudi Arabian Airlines announced at the Paris Airshow today, their decision to expand their A320neo Family aircraft order to as many as 100 aircraft, including 35 options.

The additional firm order takes Saudi Arabian Airlines’ total order to 65 aircraft, of which, 15 are the recently launched A321XLR.

Again, Saudi Arabian Airlines based this decision on the increasing traffic within its network and surrounds.

The show so far

Two days in and we’re clearly seeing Airbus’ success with the orders. Likely strained by the ongoing 737 MAX crisis, Boeing has only come out with a handful of orders, albeit the recent Korean Air 787 deal was a strong win.

With reports spreading that American Airlines is preparing for a significant A321XLR order, the scheme isn’t looking so great for Boeing.

However, with five days to go, it’s still to far too early to call this show a “failure” for the company. After all, any order is still a positive and attendance is important for rebuilding trust with the public.

"Airbus' high-profile jetliner presence at Le Bourget, and partnering with start-ups for FCAS - Airbus","Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1oaWdoLXByb2ZpbGUtamV0bGluZXItcHJlc2VuY2UtYXQtbGUtYm91cmdldC1hbmQtcGFydG5lcmluZy13aXRoLXN0YXJ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From Airbus’ smallest single-aisle jetliner – the A220, to the world’s largest passenger airplane –the A380, the company’s commercial aircraft family had a high-profile presence at this week’s Paris Air Show. An A380 utilised by Portuguese leasing specialist Hi Fly was a crowd-pleaser during today’s flying display, while an A220-300 in the colours of Latvian operator airBaltic was included in Airbus’ exhibit area at Le Bourget Airport.

The A380’s operational numbers are as impressive as its size: approximately 140,000 passengers are transported daily by the 230-plus aircraft in service today, with some 150 routes and 70 destinations serviced by the jetliner. Equally remarkable are the fleet statistics: a daily utilisation of 13-plus hours, average flight durations of more than eight hours, and a 99.1% operational reliability.

This underscores the double-deck jetliner’s continuing role in boosting traffic, feeding networks and hubs, as well as helping maximise profitability for airlines and carriers around the world. Its flexibility is demonstrated by the variety of routes flown, as illustrated by the fleet-leader, Emirates (currently operating more than 100 A380s on 550 weekly flights), with trips ranging from the 1-hour, 350-km. trip between Dubai and Muscat to long-haul and ultra-long-haul routes linking Dubai with Los Angeles (13,800 km), Dallas (15,200 km), and Auckland (15,250 km, for a flight duration of 16 hours).

A380 services meet airlines’ needs for additional seats

Airbus’ tagline for the A380 is: “More seats to meet demand,” which is illustrated by such multi-frequency utilisation as Emirates’ Dubai to London service (nine daily A380 flights), between London and Singapore (a total of six daily trips, operated by British Airways, Qantas and Singapore Airlines), five daily Singapore-Sydney flights (flown by Qantas and Singapore Airways), and four daily trips linking Abu Dhabi and Paris (Etihad Airways).

Other examples of services that benefit from the A380’s size, efficiency and passenger comfort are Malaysia Airline’s Amal pilgrim flights to Saudi Arabia for Hajj and Umrah; Tokyo-Honolulu flights by the latest A380 operator – All Nippon Airways – introducing a new level of luxury service for passengers on the no. 1 resort route for Japanese travellers; and missions performed by Hi Fly (the first A380 wet-lessor, using second-hand aircraft) on behalf of Air Austral, Air Senegal, Norwegian, and Thomas Cook.

Although Airbus’ production of the A380 is to be phased out by 2021, there’s a long future ahead for this jetliner. In addition to the commitment for continued support, services and spares availability by Airbus and its suppliers, the A380 fleet will benefit from operational improvements and optimisation of the A380’s maintenance programme.

iflyA380.com makes it easy to find and book A380 flights

To facilitate passengers’ search and reservation of A380 flights, the Airbus iflyA380.com booking assistant website and smartphone application remain popular platforms, attracting millions of visitors since their launch in 2016 and 2018, respectively. They provide all information necessary to choose an A380 flight, and also feature Instagram posts by passengers sharing their experience aboard the aircraft.

Today, an A380 takes off or lands every two minutes somewhere in the world, and the iconic jetliner will be proudly flying for decades to come.

Airbus’ smallest jetliner A220: the airBaltic experience

In addition to having airBaltic’s A220-300 on display at Le Bourget Airport, the airline briefed international journalists on its experience since the service entry in December 2016. The 150-seat two-class jetliner features the quietest cabin in its category, offering wide-body comfort in a single-aisle configuration.

“The aircraft has contributed to a range of changes in airBaltic’s business model with its economics and the positive passenger experience,” said Martin Gauss, airBaltic’s CEO. “Additionally, this 150-seat airplane allows us to enter markets unavailable to competitors.”

Gauss expects the A220’s new extended range to provide even more opportunities for the operator, opening routes such as Riga, Latvia to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The A220’s comfort and reliability were reconfirmed when airBaltic was chosen as the Pope’s official carrier during his visit to the Baltic states in 2018. “After the trip, Pope Francis told us he was very happy with the aircraft, as it gave him and his delegation the comfort level he expected,” said Gauss.

Airbus’ vision for autonomous flight

Another topic highlighted today at the Paris Air Show was autonomous technology – underscoring Airbus’ core goal of connecting and protecting people, embracing autonomous technology to serve its missions. Autonomous flight is changing the aerospace and transportation industry – and Airbus innovation is at the forefront of this transformation. Autonomous systems already exist across the company’s product portfolio – from space launch vehicles and satellites to drone systems and commercial aircraft.

Airbus’ Silicon Valley outpost, A3, is contributing to the company’s vision on autonomy through Wayfinder: a project which is creating scalable, certifiable autonomy-related systems that can power self-piloted aircraft applications throughout Airbus – ranging from small urban air vehicles to large commercial jetliners.

The work began with another Airbus innovation – the Vahana all-electric, self-piloted demonstrator – for which the Wayfinder team developed the on-board detect-and-avoid systems used to safely navigate in high-density urban airspace. As a result of this successful project, Wayfinder was launched to evolve a common set of software and hardware to be used in a scalable way for a range of aircraft – focusing on technology, data-driven development processes and safety.

Technologies developed by the team can provide both near-term and long-term value to Airbus, supporting the company’s position as an aerospace industry leader and innovator.

Partnering with start-ups for technological breakthroughs in FCAS

In other developments at the Paris Air Show, Airbus announced plans to cooperate with innovative technology players – including start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as research institutes particularly in the software domain – with the aim of unlocking new ideas, technologies and research for Europe’s Future Combat Air System project. Airbus also has begun seeking suitable partners with the help of such internal initiatives as Airbus BizLab and Airbus Ventures. Bruno Fichefeux, the Head of FCAS at Airbus, believes partnering with innovative industry players will allow Airbus to remain at the cutting edge of development, ensuring the ambitious European FCAS military aviation project will benefit from the industry’s latest technological advances.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985926747322083}",neutral,0.9985926747322083,0

Paris 2019: Airbus launches A321XLR on back of ALC order - Aviation Week,"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL3BhcmlzLTIwMTktYWlyYnVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLWEzMjF4bHItYmFjay1hbGMtb3JkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus made the decision on the back of several launch orders that are expected to be unveiled at the show later his week. The first publicly announced commitment came from Air Lease Corporation (ALC).

The lessor signed a memorandum of agreement for 27 aircraft. The company also committed to buying 23 A321neos that can be converted to the LR version of the aircraft and 50 A220-300s.

ALC will receive the first A321XLR “at the back end of 2023” according to executive chairman Steve Udvar-Hazy. That would be around two years ahead of the earliest conceivable entry-into-service date of the proposed Boeing new mid-market airplane (NMA).

ALC chief executive John Plueger sees “a potential for 50 new airlines [ordering the XLR] in the next five years at least.” The aircraft will be a “formidable competitor” for the planned NMA, he said. “And it will be available many years earlier.""

Airbus is using the A321neo variant as a tool to make the NMA’s addressable market as small as possible. The launch is now adding pressure on Boeing to move ahead with the NMA to avoid losing too much of the segment.

Airbus chief commercial officer Christian Scherer pointed out that ALC is “a reference for many [airlines] in their fleet decisions.”

Unlike Boeing, Airbus has no plans for an all-new aircraft in market niche but plans to pitch the A321LR/XLR and the A330neo to airlines.

The A321XLR differs in some ways from the baseline A321neo and the A321LR. Its maximum take-off weight is increased from 97 to 101 tonnes, the gear will be strengthened and Airbus is developing single-slotted flaps to preserve the take-off performance of today’s aircraft. Engine thrust requirements are not changing according to Airbus although Hazy hinted that the engine manufacturers will “have to make some improvements”.

The main change to the aircraft’s configuration is the addition of an integrated rear centre tank (RCT) for increased fuel volume. Airlines also have the option to add another auxiliary fuel tank forward of the wing should missions require it.

The aircraft will be capable for flying up to 4,700 nm in a configuration for around 200 passengers. That is around 700 nm more than what the LR offers. It puts the aircraft into the same range territory as the 757. The A321neo is certified for up to 244 passengers and is to burn 30% less fuel per seat than the Boeing 757 which is currently used on thin long-haul routes by many airlines across the Atlantic

Scherer said the RCT will hold an additional fuel volume equivalent to four auxiliary fuel tanks but will only occupy the space of two and weigh as much as one of the removable tanks. The arrangement, he pointed out, is liberating space for cargo. The RCT will weigh “a few hundred pounds” and will therefore not add a lot of unnecessary structural weight for the aircraft on shorter missions where the additional capabilities are not required.

The XLR can do missions like Sapporo-Delhi from the Middle East to Bali, from Japan to Australia, Rome to New York or Miami to Buenos Aires, Scherer pointed out.

Airbus has 2,327 firm orders for the A321neo and 130 for the LR version.

It’s part of a wider trend that has some Israeli observers fretting over the “Americanization” of their proud defense industry.

Israel’s current political crisis is compounding the problem, with the country headed into its second general election in five months after embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition. But a long-term driver is a change the US made to its Foreign Military Financing (FMF) loans to Israel, requiring Tel Aviv to spend an ever-growing share of FMF funds — eventually, as of 2028, 100 percent — on US contractors.

With the Israeli defense budget long dependent on US subsidies, the rule change pushes Tel Aviv to favor US firms and US-led teams for contracts. That, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) says, is why the Israeli government won’t even give it a chance to compete for a new Israeli Air Force tanker. Even Israeli exports are affected by the Americanization trend, with Rafael teaming with Lockheed on its SPICE and Spike smart weapons — and IAI’s own ELTA subsidiary is joining forces with Lockheed on radar.

Tanker Troubles

Mid-air refueling is crucial to extend the range of modern jet fighters — for example, if Israel decides to strike Iran, almost a thousand miles away. But the Israeli Air Force relies on aging tankers converted from the venerable Boeing 707, first built in 1959. One tanker was recently retired after 34 years in service. Old aircraft can only be refitted and upgraded so many times, and the IAF says it urgently needs six to eight new tankers and any further delays in buying replacements could result in “serious operational problems.”

So, on May 16, the Israeli defense ministry issued a formal Letter Of Request (LOR) to buy two of Boeing’s brand-new — and so far badly buggy — KC-46As, derived from the civilian 767. Israeli sources say Tel Aviv may ask the US Air Force to divert two aircraft from the production line to the IAF so the first tanker can arrive in Israel in 2022.

But not even two weeks after the request for KC-46As came out, on May 29th, Netanyahu failed to form a coalition and dissolved the Knesset, with new elections set for September. Amidst the turmoil, a joint delegation of Boeing’s biggest rivals, Lockheed Martin and Airbus, came to the Israeli government with their own tanker proposal. They offered the Airbus A-330 MMRT, to be assembled not in Europe but at an Airbus facility in Mobile, Alabama.

That could drive the tankers up to the 50 percent US-built threshold that would allow Israel to buy them with American FMF dollars. Lockheed and Airbus refused to answer questions about their joint offer. But the two companies did sign an agreement in December to explore tanker sales and services worldwide, a move widely seen as aimed at countries receiving American FMF funds.

Meanwhile, Israel’s own IAI has offered to convert used Boeing 767s — the same aircraft from which the KC-46A derives — to serve as new tankers for the Israeli Air Force. IAI claims that the Israeli defense ministry has not even given it the chance to compete for the tanker replacement.

Of course, it’s possible that the IAF is sick of old aircraft and has demanded brand-new 767 tankers straight from Boeing, not reconditioned ones via IAI. That said, it’s also significant that Tel Aviv can’t spend FMF funds on an IAI contract, but it can on a Lockheed-Airbus bid.

Bombs, Missiles, & Radars

While IAI looks for slingstones to take down the American Goliath, its Israeli archrival has decided to join the gentile giant. On May 16th — the same day Tel Aviv formally asked to buy Boeing tankers — Rafael and Lockheed Martin announced a partnership “to jointly develop, market, manufacture and support Rafael’s Smart, Precise Impact and Cost-Effective (SPICE™) guidance kits for U.S. sale.” The two companies had already joined forces to market Rafael’s Spike missiles to the US Army the year before.

(Yes, Rafael really offers two related products whose names are just one letter apart, a branding faux-pas of the first order).

SPICE-equipped smart bombs have been a crucial tool in Israeli airstrikes on Iranian-linked facilities in Syria, where there’s intense political imperative to limit collateral damage, especially to Russian advisors nearby. The Lebanese press has reported that SPICE fragments were found at strike sites.

So SPICE has been a quintessentially Israeli instrument. But an Israeli source said that the “Americanization” of the weapon will allow Lockheed to offer it to customers worldwide, especially operators of Lockheed’s F-16 Falcon and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. (Israeli flies both).

Meanwhile, IAI’s own electronics subsidiary, ELTA, is partnering with Lockheed for the US Army’s Lower-Tier Air & Missile Defense Sensor radar competition. LTAMDS evolved from an effort to modernize the Patriot’s radar but is now intended to play a wider role in the Army’s future air and missile defense network. The Lockheed-ELTA offering is based on the Israeli company’s S-Band Multi-Missile Radar (MMR) used on one of the Israeli defense industry’s star systems, Iron Dome, which the US Army is buying as a stop-gap missile defense.

So what does Lockheed bring to this partnership? To start with, access to the US market and US dollars — which will be increasingly critical to Israeli arms makers as the clock counts down to 2028.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5191095471382141}",negative,0.5191095471382141,-1

HARBIN - Harbin Hafei Airbus Composite Manufacturing Centre (HMC), a joint venture between Airbus and Chinese partners, has become the sole composite structure supplier of some A350 XWB parts, announced Airbus on Thursday.

The joint venture in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, has become a key part of the global supply chain, Airbus said.

According to Airbus, HMC is now the sole composite structure supplier worldwide for its A350XWB rudder, elevator, belly fairing and S19 maintenance door work package. Operational A350XWB airplanes are assembled with these composite parts which are manufactured in China.

It also provides 100 percent of all its A320 single-aisle aircraft's rudder shells and 80 percent of all rudder assemblies.

""Harbin Composite Manufacturing Centre is a key participant which makes the A350XWB and A320 fly. It has become an integrated part in Airbus' global supply chain and will continue to play an important role in contributing to the success of Airbus commercial aircraft,"" said Francois Mery, Airbus Commercial Aircraft China COO.

Mery made the remarks at the tenth anniversary of the operation of the HMC. He said Airbus will continue to extend and deepen the long-term partnership with the Chinese aviation industry.

""We are moving faster to meet the target of making the total value of China-Airbus industrial cooperation to reach one billion dollars by 2020,"" he added.

The HMC is a joint venture between Airbus and its Chinese partners of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and Harbin Development Zone Infrastructure Development Company Limited (HELI). Airbus China owns 29 percent of the joint venture.

For the A350XWB program, the manufacturing center delivered its 300th A350XWB elevator in May this year. And the 300th A350XWB rudder and 400th A350XWB maintenance door will be delivered in the coming months.

And for the A320 program, HMC delivered the 1,000th A320 rudder in June 2017, followed by the 2,000th delivery in May this year.

""The successful operation of the HMC for ten years is an important achievement of the win-win cooperation between AVIC and Airbus,"" said Gu Haicheng, vice-president of AVIC and chairman of the HMC Board.

""It also marks a major step of the integration of China into global aviation industry chain,"" he said.

China is the largest market of Airbus commercial aircraft. To date, around 1,750 Airbus commercial airplanes are serving for the Chinese market, according to Airbus.

Meanwhile, China is also an important industrial cooperation partner of Airbus. In 2017, the total value of industrial cooperation between Airbus and the Chinese aviation industry reached $641 million in 2017.

China is now the world's second largest civil aviation market and is expected to become the largest in mid-2020, according to the International Air Transport Association.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8409236073493958}",neutral,0.8409236073493958,0
Cost reduction central to Airbus future-wing programme - Flightglobal,"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyZnJhbWVycy9jb3N0LXJlZHVjdGlvbi1jZW50cmFsLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1mdXR1cmUtd2luZy1wcm9ncmFtbWUvMTMyNjc2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will in June begin assembly of the first structure under its Wing of Tomorrow technology demonstrator programme, aimed at developing a composite wing manufacturing concept for a next-generation single-aisle aircraft. The 5m (16ft) part is an initial test article ahead of the planned assembly in 2020 of three full-scale demonstrators at a newly built research centre next to Airbus’s UK wing factory in Broughton, Flintshire.

Although Airbus has not yet launched a replacement for its A320 family, the manufacturer appears keen to employ a carbonfibre wing on any future single-aisle aircraft. Sue Partridge, head of the Wing of Tomorrow programme, told FlightGlobal in April that the goal is for the primary wing structure to be made from carbonfibre, while individual components may be manufactured from advanced metallic or thermoplastic composite materials.

Switching to a carbonfibre structure on new-generation aircraft – such as the A350 or Boeing 787 – has enabled airframers to improve aerodynamic efficiency by building longer, slimmer wings without the weight penalty from a traditional metal design.

A350-900

Airbus

Airbus has used carbonfibre empennages and other composite components on its aircraft for decades – as has Boeing – and has been able to increase production of those parts as aircraft output has grown, especially in the single-aisle segment. The European airframer intends to raise monthly output of A320-family aircraft to 60 units this year, and has studied potential increases beyond 70.

But conventional carbonfibre manufacturing is substantially more expensive and requires longer cycle times than traditional aluminium aerostructures. Also, output cannot be simply scaled up - a serious impediment to rising narrowbody production

Partridge’s brief is to develop a production approach that will reduce the manufacturing cost for a composite single-aisle wing to match that of the metal wing on today's A321. Additionally, the system will need to support output of 60 aircraft per month within two years of a programme launch – “the critical bit of the target”, she notes – and be capable of reaching rate 100 at a later stage.

GREATER AUTOMATION

The project concentrates on three main areas: component manufacturing process improvements, developing new assembly approaches with greater automation, and integrating the wing and its internal systems in what Partridge terms a “more modular” way than today.

An overall target is to reduce process steps, manual labour and part count. Structures traditionally assembled from individual metal parts will be built as integrated units in order to simplify wing assembly and reduce usage of fasteners. Inside the wing, Airbus intends to reduce system complexity and to integrate, as much as possible, equipment before final wing assembly. Under the future design, it will not be necessary for production staff to climb into fuel tanks during wing integration, Partridge says.

The first of the three full-scale demonstrators due to be assembled in 2020 will be used for structural tests to validate new composite manufacturing techniques. The programme participants are exploring multiple approaches to increase productivity of carbonfibre processes, including dry-fibre deposition with later resin infusion and out-of-autoclave curing.

“Wherever possible we are looking at more than one technology option,” says Partridge. “By looking at more than one technology and using the demonstrators to understand those options, we will be able to [make trade-offs] and offer mature technologies as options to the business.""

The second demonstrator will be a fully integrated wing to validate the system integration approach, while the third is to be manufactured at production-rate conditions in order to “really understand the rate capabilities of the technologies we have chosen”, Partridge says.

Airbus has determined the shape and architecture of the demonstrator wing and the project has passed the critical design review stage. Now, the team is in the process of manufacturing tooling and preparing the production of the demonstrators. Airbus is targeting early 2022 for completion of the Wing of Tomorrow programme.

“The objective of the programme is to get the business ready for the launch of a next-generation single-aisle-type product,” says Partridge. Acknowledging the A320 family’s existential importance for Airbus, she says: “Managing the transition from the A320 family to a new single-aisle product will be critical to the business… We have to get it right. We have to ramp up very quickly, and in order to do that we need to ensure technologies that meet our cycle time and cost targets.”

MINIMISING RISK

Russ Dunn, chief technology officer and head of strategy at UK aerostructures specialist GKN Aerospace, says that providing mature processes and minimising production risks are central to the project. GKN manufactures the carbonfibre wing spar for the A400M military airlifter, and rear spar and trailing edge assembly for the A350. The supplier is targeting a similar work package on any future single-aisle programme, and is a partner in the Wing of Tomorrow effort alongside other suppliers and research institutes

Dunn says that in the past, suppliers made bids for work packages and then developed the required technologies. “Today that approach won’t work. The customer needs to be really confident that you have control of the process. This is the reason why big technology programmes are so important,” he says.

Simulation has become a central tool to develop and, crucially, further explore manufacturing techniques to make improvements. Dunn says that detailed simulation has enabled manufacturers to “really understand the opportunities in the process”. While carbonfibre has been used in aerospace for decades, during most of that time, manufacturing processes were developed through physical exploration – learning by doing.

It is only in recent years that simulation capability has developed sufficiently to represent in detail how composites behave during manufacturing, and what effect that has on a finished component’s properties.

In Dunn’s view, existing composite know-how is still “relatively immature”, with ample room for improvement – and simulation is a means of unlocking that potential. “You need to understand deposition, resin flow, temperature – there are a lot of variables in the process that you need to be able to simulate in order to both optimise your [component] design and manufacturing process,” he says.

So, what happens when the Wing of Tomorrow programme has been completed? Dunn says that from GKN’s point of view it would be “ideal” if Airbus were to launch a new single-aisle programme over the next two years.

Although required technologies are not ready yet, he is confident that GKN will be in a good place towards the end of the effort to bid on a new aircraft programme. “If that decision was pushed five or 10 years down the line, clearly we need to look at what further opportunities we will have to refine or improve the technology,” he says.

Airbus has previously said that it does not foresee the arrival of a clean-sheet single-aisle aircraft before 2030. Prior to the A320neo’s launch in 2010, the airframer had suggested 2025 as a potential service-entry target. But the re-engining programme that gave rise to the neo has pushed the next generation back. At the time the re-engine effort was launched Airbus indicated that propulsion technology had not advanced sufficiently to warrant development of an all-new aircraft.

A typical eight-year span for development of a clean-sheet aircraft for a service-entry around 2030 would place a potential launch near the end of Wing of Tomorrow’s scheduled duration. Dunn thinks that increased environmental pressure could be a catalyst to accelerate a new product launch, rather than to delay it further: “Sustainability in aviation will become a stronger theme… and there will be more pressure to bear on all of us involved in the aviation industry to do what we can to provide more efficient light products,” he says.

He notes that as even relatively small weight savings can generate substantial fuel efficiencies over an aircraft’s lifecycle, it is in the interest of manufacturers to make improvements that might previously have been considered too much effort.

BREXIT

Then there is the question of Brexit and potential consequences for Airbus’s wing production in the UK. The Wing of Tomorrow programme is based in the UK as all of Airbus’s commercial aircraft wings are assembled in Broughton; engineering and manufacturing activities and A400M wing assembly are located in Bristol. Partridge stresses, however, that the Wing of Tomorrow programme is a “transnational” effort, with activities and partners in France, Germany, Spain and other countries.

She notes: “The knowledge of wings, both from an engineering and industrial point of view, here in the UK is extremely relevant to the programme - that’s why the programme is being led by the team in the UK.” Airbus has declined, however, to discuss potential consequences for its UK activities after Brexit, now scheduled for 31 October. The airframer merely states that it is looking forward to “further clarity and the removal of uncertainty as soon as possible” so that it can “properly plan for the future”. The company adds: “We continue to plan for ‘no deal’ as that is the only way any responsible business can plan.” Measures include parts stockpiling, co-ordination with suppliers, and preparations for potential customs and regulatory changes in order to mitigate risks “where possible”, Airbus says.

But the manufacturer has repeatedly voiced its opposition to Brexit and warned that it would consider its UK presence if the country were to exit from the EU in a disorderly manner. In January, former Airbus chief executive Tom Enders – he retired in April and was replaced by Guillaume Faury – condemned the uncertainty over the UK’s arrangements as a “disgrace” and stated that the airframer is “not dependent on the UK”.

Enders praised the UK for having been “at the forefront of global aviation for over a century”, but argued – in view of the then-planned departure from the EU on 29 March – that the country’s aerospace industry was on a “precipice” which is “threatening to destroy” the sector’s legacy. “If there is a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.

“Make no mistake – there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.”

Dunn acknowledges that the UK government has “strongly supported” GKN’s technology activities and that the company’s proximity to Airbus’s UK operations creates benefits. “We very much want to see that continue,” he says. But he points out that GKN receives similar support for technology activities at its facilities in the Netherlands and Sweden. “Our aim would clearly be to be globally competitive in all technologies we do,” he adds.

GKN Aerospace chief executive Hans Buthker said at a briefing in April that technology development is central to securing supply contracts on new aircraft programmes. He asserts, however, that in order to attract new business, GKN additionally needs to be able to establish operations close to the customer. “Proximity is important,” he says. Noting investment to establish facilities in Asia – in addition to GKN’s footprint across Europe and in North America – he says: “We are able to play the game on a global scale… We like to follow our customers.”

French Prime Minister meets Airbus Helicopters apprentices - Airbus,"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNi1mcmVuY2gtcHJpbWUtbWluaXN0ZXItbWVldHMtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWFwcHJlbnRpY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le Bourget - During a visit dedicated to highlighting the role of apprenticeships in the French aeronautical industry, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe met with some of the several hundred young apprentices that work at Airbus Helicopters. The Prime Minister was then invited to experience first-hand one of the next generation helicopters that they have contributed to during their apprenticeship.

Leaving the Paris Air Show in comfort, thanks to the H160’s low vibration and sound levels, the Prime Minster was joined by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Florence Parly, who unveiled the military version of the H160, the “Guépard”, a couple of weeks earlier, as well as Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.

Apprenticeship is an effective way of learning essential work skills and ultimately finding a job in the technical fields of work in the French aeronautical industry. 370 apprentices, of which 15% were women, worked at Airbus Helicopters in 2018, and more than 200 new young people enter the apprenticeship system each year. Airbus values apprenticeship as a path to excellence, with 40% of its apprentices receiving awards in the 2018 national competition for the Best Apprentice in France.

American Airlines Is Betting on the Airbus A321XLR - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1iZXR0aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxyLTAwMTAwMDExMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As expected, Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) launched the longest-range variant of its popular A321neo jet -- the A321XLR -- at last week's Paris Air Show. With a stated range of 4,700 nautical miles, the A321XLR will have by far the most range in its size class, allowing airlines to open up new long-haul routes that don't have enough demand to support wide-body service.

The A321XLR has already attracted substantial interest from airlines. During the air show, Airbus won 48 firm orders and 79 commitments for the new model, and customers converted another 99 firm orders from other models to the A321XLR.

No. 1 global airline American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) made the biggest commitment to the new jet model, agreeing to take 50. Let's take a look at why American Airlines is so bullish on the A321XLR.

More than just a 757 replacement

Like the other two big U.S. network carriers, American Airlines currently uses Boeing 757-200s for ""long-and-thin"" routes between the East Coast and Europe, as well as on certain routes to South America. However, the 757 has been out of production for 15 years. The 34 Boeing 757s that American still operates are nearly 20 years old on average.

American Airlines plans to replace 10 of its remaining 757s later this year, but there is no good substitute currently available for the other 24, which serve longer routes. The A321XLR is perfect, though, offering more range and 30% lower fuel burn per seat.

As a result, American has decided to convert 30 of its existing Airbus A321neo orders to the A321XLR variant. The first eight will arrive in 2023 -- the first year of availability -- with the remaining 22 coming in 2024. That will be perfect timing for replacing American Airlines' last 24 757s.

However, American Airlines' management sees the Airbus A321XLR as more than just a replacement for the carrier's current 757s. The airline exercised 20 of its A321neo options to order additional A321XLRs that will arrive in 2025, bringing its A321XLR fleet to a total of 50 aircraft.

Story continues

Enabling new routes

Given that American Airlines plans to take roughly twice as many A321XLRs as it would need to replace the 24 757s that will remain in its fleet after this year, the airline clearly expects this aircraft to open up new growth opportunities.

The A321XLR could be particularly useful in Philadelphia, American's main transatlantic hub. Philadelphia doesn't have the same level of local demand as New York, where Delta Air Lines and United Continental have their main transatlantic gateways. Thus, having a smaller long-haul aircraft could be vital for sustaining service to destinations that attract less traffic.

American will also be able to fly from its Miami hub to pretty much anywhere in South America using the A321XLR. This could help the carrier expand its service to Brazil, where it has had to eliminate several routes in recent years due to a downturn in demand. Demand for travel to South America tends to be counterseasonal compared to the transatlantic market, so American may be able to serve smaller international destinations on a seasonal basis, flying A321XLRs to Europe during the spring and summer and to South America during the fall and winter.

The international expansion opportunities provided by the Airbus A321XLR will help American Airlines diversify away from the domestic market, to which it has greater exposure than its main rivals.

One small piece of the profitability-improvement puzzle

As a small, fuel-efficient aircraft capable of flying long-haul routes, the A321XLR will improve American Airlines' ability to match capacity to demand in its international network. And by enabling the carrier to add more international routes to its arsenal, the new aircraft will put American Airlines in a better position to win valuable corporate travel contracts.

American's A321XLRs will also enable the airline to simplify its fleet, as the plane will be very similar to the A321s and A321neos that American Airlines already operates. Meanwhile, the older 757 family will be fully retired by 2025 at the latest, reducing the company's costs.

The Airbus A321XLR certainly isn't a complete solution to American Airlines' recent struggles with weak profitability. Nevertheless, it could become an important part of the airline's turnaround plan.
