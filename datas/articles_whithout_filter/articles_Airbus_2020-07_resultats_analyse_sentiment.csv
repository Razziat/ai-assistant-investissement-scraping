Airbus US pivots business strategy away from selling big platforms to the Pentagon - Defense News,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvMjAyMC8wNy8xNS9haXJidXMtdXMtcGl2b3RzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXN0cmF0ZWd5LWF3YXktZnJvbS1zZWxsaW5nLWJpZy1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtdG8tdGhlLXBlbnRhZ29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — After decades of trying to break into the U.S. military aircraft market, Airbus is shifting course with a new strategy that prioritizes selling off-the-shelf sensors, data, space and intelligence capabilities that have been customized for U.S. government buyers.

During a Wednesday discussion with reporters about the new direction for the business, Chris Emerson, the new chief executive of the Airbus U.S. Space and Defense division and formerly the president of Airbus Helicopters, said he wanted to move the company’s focus in the United States away from the major fixed-wing platforms that are the company’s bread and butter in Europe.

Instead, he hopes to expand the company’s presence in the growing space and intelligence markets, particularly with low-cost satellites like those made by its joint venture One Web, geospatial intelligence and imaging, and space-based sensors.

“We know the Air Force needs an A400M, but I can spend 10 years trying to convince the Air Force and all the politicians that they should buy an A400M. And ultimately they will buy C-130s,” Emerson said.

“So let me focus this energy, this great leadership team, on achieving something that is tangible today that the customer really needs. Yes, it’s not traditional for Airbus, but it will bring the value and we’ll have a better foundation if one day my successor says, ‘You know, I want to be a big platform competitor.’ At least we’d have built up trust and proven that we could really meet the requirements that are demanded of it.”

Although Airbus is a juggernaut in the international military and commercial aerospace market, it has always struggled to find its place among the U.S. defense prime contractors as major aircraft manufacturers. It famously lost the KC-X contract to Boeing in 2011 after a bloody and prolonged battle. Since then, the company’s biggest procurement victory has been continued sales of its UH-72A Lakota helicopter to the Army.

“I remember I spent eight years thinking we could bring real value on air-to-air refueling for the Air Force. But I spent eight years, and I’m frustrated because I look at it and we didn’t succeed,” Emerson said. “I’ve asked the team, ‘Let’s find a roadmap where we can actually make a mark with the customers.’ And that means, I’m not going to go look at competing with Boeing and the Lockheeds and Northrop, but I’m going to look at other areas.”

The U.S. customer is increasingly making investments into technologies that can augment or accelerate decision-making, he said.

“That’s where we start to look everything beyond an air breathing platform. We started to look at the data, the intelligence, that they need,” he said. “It could be intelligence that is geospatial-related, either Earth observation, or electro-optical, or synthetic aperture radar, or a blend that we’re pulling in multi-source information.”

Airbus already develops those types of capabilities in its commercial air and space businesses, and could quickly adapt them to U.S. demands, he said.

When there are opportunities to offer Airbus aircraft to the U.S. military, the strategy will be to partner with American primes, Emerson said. For instance, last year Airbus and Lockheed signed a memorandum of understanding to market aerial refueling services to the U.S. Air Force using the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport.

Asked on Wednesday whether the two companies planned to compete for tanker leasing opportunities currently being considered by the Air Force, Emerson said Lockheed takes the lead on interactions with the U.S. military on aerial refueling.

He added that UH-72s will continue to be manufactured alongside Airbus’s commercial H125 helicopter in Columbus, Miss., but modifications, support and contracting will be performed by the Airbus U.S. Space and Defense.

In addition to naming Emerson as head of the company’s U.S. defense and space business, Airbus also appointed a five-person board of directors — which includes former National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency director Letitia Long and William Shelton, a retired Air Force four-star and former head of Air Force Space Command — aimed at deepening ties with the U.S. military, space and intelligence agencies. It also named a seven-person team of advisers made up of former national security officials.

Airbus reorganizes U.S. operations to fuel growth in space and defense - SpaceNews,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtcmVvcmdhbml6ZXMtdS1zLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtdG8tZnVlbC1ncm93dGgtaW4tc3BhY2UtYW5kLWRlZmVuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus is reorganizing its U.S.-based operations in an effort to strengthen its position in the space and intelligence markets, officials said July 15.

A new business unit, called Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, will focus on the military, intelligence and NASA markets, said Christopher Emerson, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense. He was previously the president of Airbus Helicopters.

Speaking on a video chat with reporters, Emerson said the new unit operates under a Special Security Agreement with the U.S. government that allows it to compete for highly sensitive national security and defense contracts.

The Special Security Agreement requires Airbus’ U.S. business to be run by an independent board of directors that is not managed by the parent company’s corporate leadership in France.

Airbus U.S. Space & Defense will be headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Its newly appointed boards of directors and advisors are packed with former U.S. government and senior military officials.

Emerson noted the financial impact from the coronavirus pandemic on Airbus’ commercial business. Meanwhile, “Governments around the world have been open for business over the past four months,” he said. The reorganization of the company’s U.S. business is intended to bring Airbus’ commercially developed technology into the government market.

The primary markets for Airbus U.S. Space & Defense are military aircraft, geospatial intelligence and satellites.

Jose Antonio de la Fuente was named head of Airbus U.S. Military Aircraft; Didier Cormary head of Airbus U.S. Connected Intelligence; and Debra Facktor head of Airbus U.S. Space.

OneWeb Satellites

Airbus has a 50% stake in OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture Airbus and OneWeb created in 2016 to build hundreds of satellites for the OneWeb constellation.

The recent OneWeb Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sale of OneWeb to the U.K. government have not led to any change in Airbus’ plan to continue manufacturing satellites at the company’s factory in Florida, said Emerson.

“Our venture in Florida was the first step we took to expand our business in the U.S.,” he said. “We are committed in the United States, to the facility in Florida.”

The plant has been idle recently but will start ramping up and producing satellites for OneWeb under its new ownership, Emerson said. Airbus also is pursuing new customers looking for commoditized low-cost satellites.

“We hired a dedicated space engineering team to continue to modify the OneWeb satellite bus to be used by more customers in the U.S.,” said Emerson. The supply chain is being “Americanized” so satellites can be offered to the U.S. Defense Department, intelligence agencies and NASA.

OneWeb Satellites “is a critical asset for us,” said Emerson. “You’ll see more than just one product.”

Facktor, chief of Airbus U.S. Space, said the company sees a strong demand from the U.S. government for low Earth orbit satellites. “We’re leveraging that factory in Florida,” she said. “OneWeb has 74 sats in orbit. That gives us a lot of heritage, which is what you need in this business to demonstrate you can execute.”

Civil space, geospatial intelligence

Emerson said Airbus plans to offer space technologies to NASA for its exploration efforts. “There is greater complexity in requirements, and we see an opportunity,” he said.

The traditional model is for NASA to use Airbus technology via its partnerships with the European Space Agency or government-to-government agreements. Airbus wants to also partner with companies like Lockheed Martin or others to deliver space technology to the U.S. government, said Emerson. “We will build supply chains in the U.S. to support programs long term.”

Airbus also plans to pursue U.S. intelligence agencies’ contracts for geospatial imagery and data analytics services.

Emerson said the company recently received a commercial remote sensing license from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to sell high-resolution imagery captured by satellites.

“We’re building a business case to sell commercial high-resolution imagery in the U.S. to government and commercial customers,” he said. That includes optical imagery and also synthetic aperture radar imagery, as well as machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.

Cormary said the company will review the upcoming National Reconnaissance Office solicitation seeking U.S. commercial imagery suppliers and will consider submitting a bid.

“Our business is first and foremost commercial,” he said. “We’re looking at opportunities.”

Airbus Miami Training Center launches scholarships for A320 Type Rating Qualification and Maintenance Technician ... - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIwLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1taWFtaS10cmFpbmluZy1jZW50ZXItbGF1bmNoZXMtc2Nob2xhcnNoaXBzLWZvci1hMzIwLXR5cGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Miami, July 9, 2020 – As part of its ongoing efforts to support the aerospace community during the Coronavirus pandemic, the Airbus Training Center in Miami (ATC) launched an A320 Type Rating Qualification course scholarship for student pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians in the United States.

The initiative is part of a collaboration between the Miami ATC, OBAP (Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals), WAI (Women in Aviation International), Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Lynn University to further support the aviation industry’s diversity and future needs.

“Airbus takes great pride in partnering with leading aerospace institutions to support aspiring aviation professionals during these unprecedented times with this scholarship, which directly responds to the growing demand for qualified pilots and technicians throughout the Americas,” said Joe Houghton, Airbus Americas Vice President of Training & Flight Operations.

In total, sixteen students will benefit from the scholarships. The pilot students will be qualified to fly an A320 upon successful completion of the training, and the maintenance students will have the opportunity for becoming candidates for entry-level maintenance positions with Airbus’ airlines and MRO customers. The A320 Family is the world’s most popular single-aisle aircraft family as it is the preferred choice of airlines around the world, being the only single-aisle aircraft offering containerized cargo capabilities, increasing the airlines’ overall operational efficiency.



In response to the pandemic, Airbus Americas has mobilized support for their local communities through initiatives such as this scholarship. Other efforts include food drives, donation campaigns of food, first aid and personal protective equipment – including 3D-printed face shields and disposable and reusable facemasks for frontline responders.

The Airbus Training Center in Miami, Florida, provides training for Airbus customers’ flight and cabin crew as well as maintenance personnel. The custom-designed, 110,000-square-foot complex has seven full-flight simulators, cabin door and slide trainers, state-of-the-art computer-based training classrooms and seven flight training devices simulating the A320, A330, A340 and A350 XWB aircraft. The Miami Airbus Training Center trains approximately 2,200 trainees a year. Trainees come from all over the world, although the majority are from Airbus operators in the United States, Canada and Latin America.

In addition to being the aircraft manufacturer operated by the largest U.S. airlines, Airbus is a major partner of U.S. aerospace companies, supporting 275,000 American jobs. In the last three years, Airbus spent $48 billion in the United States. Its facilities in the U.S. include engineering centers in Kansas and Alabama; flight and maintenance training centers in Florida and Colorado; customer service and headquarters in Virginia; an A320 Family assembly line in Alabama; an innovation center (Acubed) in California; a drone data analysis business (Airbus Aerial) in Georgia and a helicopter manufacturing and assembly in Texas and Mississippi.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9641534090042114}",positive,0.9641534090042114,1

Airbus Targets NRO Imagery Sales With New US Corporate Entity - Breaking Defense,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA3L2FpcmJ1cy10YXJnZXRzLW5yby1pbWFnZXJ5LXNhbGVzLXdpdGgtbmV3LXVzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1lbnRpdHkv0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9icmVha2luZ2RlZmVuc2UuY29tLzIwMjAvMDcvYWlyYnVzLXRhcmdldHMtbnJvLWltYWdlcnktc2FsZXMtd2l0aC1uZXctdXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWVudGl0eS8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON: Airbus is angling for a bigger share of the US space and intelligence market with a reorganization of its US operations and an independent board of directors — with its eye squarely on NRO’s upcoming contest for commercial remote sensing providers.

The new entity, called Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, is based near the Pentagon in Rosslyn, Va. It brings all of Airbus’s US operations under one corporate hat.

While Airbus, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has long had a Special Security Agreement that allows it to sell products in the US, the move to appoint an independent board of US citizens to manage the business will give it increased opportunities to break into highly-classified programs, explained Chris Emerson, the newly appointed CEO, in a roll-out brief with reporters today.

“The foundation to do business with the US is hinged around what we call a Special Security Agreement, because Airbus is based in in Europe. In order for us to establish the trust and bona fides to be able to work at every security level with the US government, we needed to set up an independent board of directors,” he said.

James Darcey, an Airbus spokesperson, clarified in an email to Breaking D that while Airbus has had SSA agreements in the past, as U.S. Space & Defense is a new corporate entity, a new one was required.

“So, while Airbus U.S. Space & Defense is not the first SSA company – and we’ve been selling to the U.S. government under SSA for some time – the new company is structured under a new board of directors, and is moving in new directions than previously,” he said.

The independent board of directors is loaded with household names in the defense community: former National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director Letitia Long; former Bush DoD exec Frank Miller; retired Gen. Willy Shelton, former head of Air Force Space Command; DoD Defense Innovation Board member Mark Sirangelo; and retired Rear Adm. Kevin Sweeney, former chief of staff to DoD Secretary Jim Mattis.

Further, the company just received a license from the Commerce Department that will allow it to sell high-resolution imagery and data analytics to the US government, as well as commercial customers, he said. (Commerce, via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, licenses all US commercial remote sensing operators.)

While Emerson said the firm’s primary focus is commercial users hungry for imagery, he said the firm also intends to respond to the NRO’s request for proposals (RFP) to expand its pool of commercial suppliers of imagery, including advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that has been traditionally supplied by the NRO’s own highly-classified satellites. As Breaking D readers know, that RFP is expected to be released by the end of the year.

It also is eyeing sales of data analyses to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); not to mention technologies to NASA for its space exploration efforts.

“As you know, from Airbus we have a pedigree — we’re probably the leader in commercial SAR capabilities,” Emerson said.

Airbus operates three X-band radar satellites, as well as two Pleiades and two Spot electro-optical satellites that utilize bandwidth into the near-infrared spectrum. Further, the company’s UK unit won a design study contract from the British Ministry of Defense for an ultra-high resolution SAR constellation, under a program called Oberon.

Airbus also is a 50 percent partner in OneWeb Satellite, based in Florida, that has been building satellites for OneWeb’s planned mega-constellation of 650 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for Internet connectivity. The fate of that operation has been up in the air because of OneWeb’s March bankruptcy.

But Emerson said that production for OneWeb is restarting, following the July 3 bid by the UK government, in partnership with Indian firm Bharti Global Ltd, to acquire the firm — with each partner contributing $500 million in investment. Further, U.S. Airbus Space & Defense is working to bring third-party US customers for the broadband communications satellites by modifying them at the Florida plant, he said.

“That is a critical asset for us that we are only going to continue to grow in the United States. You’ll see more than just one product coming from our capabilities in the US and, we’re committed and excited about the business that we have with with OneWeb Satellites,” he added.

Under Emerson, the new company will have three sub-units: Airbus U.S. Connected Intelligence led by Didier Cormary; Airbus U.S. Space, led by Debra Facktor; and Airbus US Military Aircraft, led by Jose Antonio de la Fuente.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999885559082031}",neutral,0.9999885559082031,0
Airbus takes final approach to settle 16-year WTO row with US - The Guardian,"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2p1bC8yNC9haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtZmluYWwtYXBwcm9hY2gtdG8tc2V0dGxlLTE2LXllYXItd3RvLXJvdy13aXRoLXVz0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjAvanVsLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy10YWtlcy1maW5hbC1hcHByb2FjaC10by1zZXR0bGUtMTYteWVhci13dG8tcm93LXdpdGgtdXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has said it is taking the last step to end 16 years of bitter litigation with the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over subsidies that the White House said disadvantaged rival aerospace company Boeing.

The European aircraft manufacturer on Friday said it will end a system of financial support from France and Spain that the WTO had deemed illegal and unfair to Boeing.

The Trump administration used the case as justification to slap tariffs on EU exports worth $7.5bn. Airbus has discussed the litigation in recent months with representatives of the Scotch whisky trade whose single malt exports were targeted, as well as French wine producers and Spanish olive growers.

“After 16 years of litigation at the World Trade Organization, this is the final step to stop the long-standing dispute and removes any justification for US tariffs,” Airbus said.

The EU’s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, said: “Unjustified tariffs on European products are not acceptable and, arising from the compliance in the Airbus case, we insist that the United States lifts these unjustified tariffs immediately.”

Boeing faces a parallel ruling from the WTO, due in September, that will determine how harshly the EU can retaliate over aid from the US to its aerospace champion.

The Airbus case centres on so-called “launch aid” from European countries for the development of the A350 twin-aisle plane and its larger cousin, the A380 superjumbo. WTO judges ruled the subsidies had impeded sales for rival aircraft from Boeing in the twin-aisle and very large aircraft markets, such as the 787 Dreamliner or the 747, the original superjumbo.

Airbus said on Friday it had agreed to make changes to this system of financial support. It will increase interest payments owed to the French and Spanish governments on A350 planes it delivers from now on, meaning it will not pay back the aid in one lump sum, but the company declined to detail how much the change would cost.

A WTO official said the trade body hasn’t received any communication from the European Union on this matter, and declined to comment further.

Paul Everitt, chief executive of the UK aerospace lobby group, ADS, said: “A negotiated outcome to this long-running dispute would be the best outcome for the global aerospace industry. Tariffs disrupt healthy competition, reduce consumer choices and put jobs at risk unnecessarily.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9892577528953552}",neutral,0.9892577528953552,0

Airbus transforms A330s into Multi Role Tanker Transports through an optimised conversion process - Airbus,"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy10cmFuc2Zvcm1zLWEzMzBzLWludG8tbXVsdGktcm9sZS10YW5rZXItdHJhbnNwb3J0cy10aHJvdWdoLWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having earned their reputation as the new-generation aerial tanker of choice for military services worldwide, Airbus’ A330 Multi Role Tanker Transports (MRTTs) are now being outfitted for their multi-mission duties in an optimised industrial process – enabling five aircraft to undergo the conversion every year.

The A330 MRTTs are based on Airbus’ popular A330 widebody passenger airliner, with the aircraft produced on the company’s commercial airplane final assembly line in Toulouse, France. Once their initial built-up is complete, they are flown to Airbus’ military aircraft facility in Getafe, Spain to be transformed with hardware and systems for their dual roles as an air-to-air refuelling platform and an airlifter for troops and cargo.

Thousands of new parts integrated

During the conversion, Airbus teams install some 16,000 types of new components and approximately 450 new electrical harnesses (for a total cabling length of more than 50 km.), as well as 6,000 brackets and 1,700 connectors.

With 42 A330 MRTTs delivered to date, Airbus’ has reduced the end-to-end transformation time by one month, introducing increased digitalisation and applying the “takt” principle of lean production methodology – in which the aircraft moves through the conversion with zero hours pending and zero work orders open.

The digitalisation includes the increasing use of Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality headsets instead of computer tablets. With 80 to 90 work orders now produced with HoloLens, the goal is to apply the system during 2020 for 50% of overall work orders, mainly for electrical and hydraulic installations.

The A330 MRTT’s improved conversion procedures bring increased productivity and stability to this industrial process

- Alberto Castrillo, head of the Airbus plant in Getafe

A key element of the conversion is installing the A330 MRTT’s air-to-air refuelling hardware. All aircraft are equipped with hose and drogue units, and most customers have opted for Airbus’ highly capable fly-by-wire Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) – which provides enhanced controllability during in-flight fuel transfers to receiver airplanes.

The A330 MRTT transformation process includes locating the Airbus-developed Air Refuelling Console in the cockpit area behind the pilots. Containing seats for two crew members, this station enables the aerial refuelling to be remotely controlled, aided by an advanced high-resolution observation system with panoramic 3D-vision for operations day and night.

On the A330 MRTT’s main deck, the aircraft’s widebody cross-section can be configured for a variety of roles, from the transportation of troops and personnel with capacities for 268 passengers in a two-class configuration, to aeromedical evacuation – accommodating two intensive care units, 16 stretchers, along with seating for medical staff and passengers.

Customers from around the world

Airbus delivered its initial A330 MRTT in December 2009, with this no. 1 aircraft received by the Royal Australian Air Force. Today, A330 MRTTs are flown by Australia, France, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Emirates and United Kingdom – logging a combined total of more than 200,000 flight hours.

A total of 60 A330 MRTTs have been ordered for operations at the service of 13 nations.

Orders for new aircraft collapsed during the second quarter, as the slump in air travel prompted airlines to cut spending commitments drastically.

Airbus reported on Thursday it had only eight new orders between April and June, compared with 290 in the first quarter.

The European aerospace manufacturer and its US rival, Boeing, have been hit hard by the pandemic, previously announcing swingeing job cuts as they slowed production.

Airbus is cutting 15,000 jobs, including 1,700 in the UK, where it produces wings, to cope with what its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, described as the industry’s “gravest crisis”.

Airbus will now produce only five of its wide-body A350 planes per month, down from the previous rate of six. It had cut the A350 production rate from about 10 per month in April, as it reduced production of its bestselling A320 narrowbody by a third, to 40 per month.

Airbus has an order backlog of 7,584 commercial aircraft as of 30 June, but it has decided to rein back spending as it struggles with lower revenues, with airlines queuing up to slow delivery rates in order to spread out payments.

Revenues slumped to € 18.9bn for the half year, compared with €30.9bn in 2019, after deliveries of commercial aircraft halved.

The lockdowns around the world have also caused continued operational issues. At the end of June, about 145 commercial aircraft could not be delivered because of the pandemic, Airbus said.

Airbus reported a €12.4bn cash outflow during the first half of 2020, although the cost-cutting it announced in April meant only €4.4bn of the outflow came in the second quarter, better than analysts had expected.

Faury said on Thursday it was “our ambition to not consume cash” during the second half of the year, aside from any requirements for acquisitions or to help customers with financing, as the company retrenches.

“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financials is now very visible in the second quarter, with H1 commercial aircraft deliveries halving compared with a year ago,” Faury said.

“We have calibrated the business to face the new market environment on an industrial basis and the supply chain is now working in line with the new plan.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9998021721839905}",negative,0.9998021721839905,-1
British military finalizes Skynet-6A contract with Airbus - SpaceNews,"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9icml0aXNoLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWZpbmFsaXplcy1za3luZXQtNmEtY29udHJhY3Qtd2l0aC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GLASSBORO, N.J. — Britain’s military on July 19 agreed to fully fund a gap-filler Skynet satellite it sole-sourced from Airbus Defence and Space three years ago, signing a 500-million-pound ($628.5 million) contract that covers the satellite’s manufacture and launch, as well as ground segment upgrades.

Airbus Defence and Space will build the Skynet-6A satellite in the United Kingdom and arrange a 2025 launch. RAL Space, a U.K. national laboratory, will test the all-electric satellite at its facility in Harwell. Skynet-6A, based on the Eurostar Neo platform, is expected to provide communications services for the British military until at least 2040.

“To safeguard our military on operations around the world we need to ensure that we protect their communications on land, sea or in air,” U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in a news release. “The newest contested frontier is space and so we need to provide resilience and better communications for our forces.”

The U.K. has yet to decide on a successor to its Skynet-5 network, which consists of four X-band and Ultra-High-Frequency geostationary satellites. Airbus manages the Skynet-5 network, but its contract expires in 2022.

Britain’s Ministry of Defence has been evaluating new technologies such as very high throughput satellites and low-Earth-orbit megaconstellations as it prepares an architecture for Skynet-6.

Those evaluations will now likely consider what role OneWeb could play, now that the U.K. government, through its Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is co-acquiring the megaconstellation startup with Indian telecommunications company Bharti Global.

“In our view, it now appears likely that OneWeb will be incorporated into Skynet in some fashion,” Louie DiPalma, a financial analyst at William Blair, wrote to clients in a July 16 research note.

DiPalma notes that four teams are bidding for “billions of pounds of service contracts” related to Skynet-6. The U.K. Ministry of Defence is currently competing the Skynet “Service Delivery Wrap” program, which covers satellite operations and service delivery, including the provision of ground stations and other communications equipment.

Airbus, as the incumbent, said June 16 it formed a team with KBR, Leidos, Northrop Grumman and QinetiQ to “deliver future space solutions” for the U.K. “including the Skynet Service Delivery Wrap.”

Viasat’s U.K. division has formed a team with NSSLGlobal and led by British Telecom to bid for the contract.

British satellite operator Inmarsat has partnered with Serco, Lockheed Martin UK, and CGI UK. And British defense engineering company Babcock Integrated Technology bid for the contract, but has not disclosed a team.

DiPalma wrote that “Airbus’s involvement in OneWeb may increase its odds of renewing the contract,” since Airbus and OneWeb have the joint venture OneWeb Satellites that is tasked with building the OneWeb megaconstellation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999856948852539}",neutral,0.9999856948852539,0
Airbus innovative payload to launch on Faraday-1 satellite - Airbus,"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNy1haXJidXMtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1wYXlsb2FkLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1vbi1mYXJhZGF5LTEtc2F0ZWxsaXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus developed next generation retaskable software defined radio payload to be proven in space

Airbus’ newspace initiative Prometheus will see rapid in-orbit proving of disruptive technology

Stevenage, 01 July 2020 - An Airbus developed next generation retaskable software defined radio payload, Prometheus 1, will be launched on the Faraday-1 cubesat from New Zealand on 3 July. The Faraday-1 mission is part of In Space Missions Ltd’s in-orbit demonstration programme.



Prometheus 1 is a software defined radio, connected to a 400 MHz UHF antenna that can be reprogrammed in orbit. It will be able to survey radio spectrum usage across the world from orbit, detect radar tracking of the Faraday-1 satellite, and identify and locate search and rescue beacons. Airbus is working with the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) to foster greater partnerships between SMEs, government and Airbus on space.



Airbus Defence and Space in the UK created the self funded Prometheus programme to enable the rapid development of agile and innovative payloads using disruptive technology to offer significant capability to customers. Building on Airbus’ proven track record of working with SMEs to create novel capability and prove concepts, the Prometheus programme developed the payload for Faraday-1 in under three months.



Richard Franklin, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: “By working with SMEs we are able to take advantage of their specialist capabilities and agility to develop new technologies and services for customers. Once Prometheus 1 is proven in orbit we will use it to de-risk future services and in life support solutions, working hand in hand with our SME partners. Future UK Government defence needs can be best served by the partnership approach we have pioneered at Airbus on Skynet 5, actively engaging with SMEs and developing new technologies and service solutions to prove concepts before delivering them to customers.”



Prometheus 1 will prove passive radio frequency sensing in orbit, enabling the technology to be incorporated on future missions where hostile tracking of sovereign spacecraft is likely or possible.



The Airbus newspace team is championing the Prometheus programme and a second mission is already in development, which will be cubesats with RF and optical sensors, and features inter satellite links. Prometheus 2 is due for launch in the second half of 2021.



Airbus is working with In Space Missions to offer ‘Space as a Service’ access to capability for DSTL to get involved in experiments with assets in orbit.

Airbus gets $630 million deal under UK military's Skynet 6 push - Defense News,"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjAvMDcvMjAvYWlyYnVzLWdldHMtNjMwLW1pbGxpb24tZGVhbC11bmRlci11ay1taWxpdGFyeXMtc2t5bmV0LTYtcHVzaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The first element of a likely $7.5 billion upgrade of the British armed forces’ satellite-telecommunications capabilities has finally been signed by the Ministry of Defence and Airbus Defence and Space.

The deal, worth more than $630 million, will see Airbus build a new telecommunications satellite as a stop gap to bolster military capabilities ahead of the introduction of a new generation of space craft scheduled to start entering service towards the end of the decade.

Airbus and the MoD have been locked in negotiation over the deal to construct the satellite, known as Skynet 6A, since the company was nominated in 2017, without a competition, as the preferred supplier.

Under the terms of the deal the satellite, based on Airbus’ Eurostar Neo spacecraft, will be developed, assembled and tested in the UK. Planned launch date is 2025.

In a statement Airbus said the contract also covers technology development programs, new secure telemetry, tracking and command systems, launch, in-orbit testing and ground segment updates to the current Skynet 5 system.

At one point defense officials here were sufficiently concerned about the drawn-out negotiations for Skynet 6A delaying the space crafts in-service date that they a contract with Airbus to start work on long-lead items ahead of the main deal being sealed.

The deal will supplement a fleet of existing spacecraft built by Airbus as part of the Skynet 5 space telecommunications network operated by the company under a private finance initiative (PFI) deal which has been in operation since 2003.

Operation of the Skynet ground stations was also included in the deal. The PFI, including ground station element, ends in 2022.

RELATED

A competition to run the ground stations as part of the wider Skynet 6 program is already in play, with Airbus, Babcock, BT and Serco all bidding to secure the contract for what is called the Service Delivery Wrap.

The third main element of Skynet 6, known as Enduring Capability,will see industry compete to replace existing Skynet 5 satellites with a fleet of new generation beyond line of sight communication assets. The early stages of that competition is already underway.

In-service date for the first of the new communications assets is around 2028.

Announcing the satellite deal 24 hours ahead of the launch of the virtual Farnborough air show getting underway July 20, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the “newest contested frontier is space and so we need to provide resilience and better communications for our forces. Skynet 6A is one of many solutions we shall be investing in over the next decade. This government recognizes the urgent need to defend and promote space capabilities.”

“British defense must continue to innovate and transform, particularly in cyber and space,” Wallace said.

Confirmation of the satellite deal by Wallace comes just two weeks after the British government took a $503 million stake alongside Indian company Bharti Global in the rescue of failed broadband constellation supplier OneWeb.

RELATED

OneWeb is based in the UK but its satellites are built in Florida in a partnership between Airbus and OneWeb. So far, 74 satellites out of an initial requirement for 648 have been launched.

Having been denied access by the European Union to the precise military navigational signals provided by their Galileo satellites as a result of Brexit, the British are hoping they can develop the small spacecraft operated by OneWeb to provide military-grade positioning, navigation and timing data for the armed forces.

OneWeb satellites could also find themselves developed for use by the British military as part of Skynet 6′s Enduring Capability requirement, said an industry executive here, who asked not to be named.

Space is expected to have top billing alongside cyber, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies in the upcoming integrated defense, security and foreign policy review being conducted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his advisors.

Creation of a Space Command is likely to figure in a space defense policy being pulled together by the MoD.

The bones of that policy could be presented to four-star-level officials in the next few weeks.

"'Gravest crisis' as Airbus plans to cut 15,000 jobs, 1,700 in UK - The Guardian","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2p1bi8zMC9ncmF2ZXN0LWNyaXNpcy1hcy1haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdG8tY3V0LTE1MDAwLWpvYnMtMTcwMC1pbi11a9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2p1bi8zMC9ncmF2ZXN0LWNyaXNpcy1hcy1haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdG8tY3V0LTE1MDAwLWpvYnMtMTcwMC1pbi11aw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The planemaker Airbus has announced plans to cut as many as 15,000 jobs – including 1,700 in the UK – as it warned the coronavirus pandemic had triggered the “gravest crisis” in its history.

The planned cuts represent almost 15% of the European aerospace company’s global workforce of 135,000, underlining the depth of the crisis hitting the aviation and aerospace industries. Airbus said the cuts would be made no later than 2021 after commercial aircraft business activity dropped by close to 40% in recent months.

The cuts will affect workers across Airbus’s major operations in France, Germany and Spain, as well as the UK operation making wings at Broughton, north Wales. The Welsh operation, which is expected to bear the brunt of UK job losses, employed about 6,000 workers before the crisis, with a total of 14,000 Airbus employees in the UK.

Germany was hardest hit, with 5,100 redundancies. Airbus plans 5,000 redundancies in France, 900 in Spain and 1,300 across the rest of the world.

“Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced,” said chief executive Guillaume Faury. “The measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic. Now we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers. To confront that reality, we must now adopt more far-reaching measures.”

Faury previously warned that the impact of the job cuts could fall more heavily on the UK after the French and German governments pledged to spend billions of euros to prop up their aerospace industries. The company has already told 500 workers at Broughton employed by an external agency that they would not return from furlough.

Airbus delivered a record 863 planes to its customers in 2019, far outstripping its arch-rival Boeing as the US manufacturer struggled with the global grounding of its bestselling 737 Max. However, the pandemic has since poleaxed the aviation industry and airlines have dramatically reduced their orders.

The Airbus redundancies are in line with the 16,000 announced by Boeing in April, a tenth of its workforce – although the US planemaker has also signalled that further job losses could be necessary.

Norwegian Air Shuttle on Tuesday cancelled orders for 97 Boeing jets, the largest cancellation by a single Boeing customer since the grounding of the 737 Max.

Airbus in April announced that it would cut production of its commercial aircraft by a third. That means it will only make 40 of its bestselling A320 planes a month, compared with the rate of more than 60 expected before the crisis.

The production cut meant that Airbus officials and worker representatives have been preparing for job losses for weeks, with options thought to include a voluntary redundancy programme as well as compulsory job losses.

Paul Everitt, chief executive of UK aerospace lobby group ADS, said the Airbus job cuts showed that the government would need to aid the industry further.

“Being the largest commercial aircraft company in the UK, Airbus is central to our aerospace industry and has a close relationship with its highly integrated UK supply chain,” Everitt said. “This difficult news will be unsettling for their employees and those working as part of the supply chain.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9323393702507019}",negative,0.9323393702507019,-1
Airbus takes final step to end long-standing WTO dispute and U.S. tariffs - Airbus,"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNy1haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtZmluYWwtc3RlcC10by1lbmQtbG9uZy1zdGFuZGluZy13dG8tZGlzcHV0ZS1hbmQtdXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 24 July 2020 - Airbus has agreed with the governments of France and Spain to make amendments to the A350 Repayable Launch Investment (RLI) contracts. After 16 years of litigation at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), this is the final step to stop the long-standing dispute and removes any justification for U.S. tariffs.

The tariffs imposed by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) are currently harming all targeted industry sectors, including U.S. airlines, and are adding to a very difficult environment as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis. This is why Airbus has decided to make a final step to remove the last contentious point and amend the French and Spanish contracts to what the WTO considers the appropriate interest rate and risk assessment benchmarks. The WTO has already ruled that RLI is a valid instrument for governments to partner with industry by sharing investment risks. With this final move, Airbus considers itself in complete compliance with all WTO rulings.

“We have fully complied with all the WTO requirements. These additional amendments to the A350 RLIs demonstrate that Airbus has left no stone unturned to find a way towards a solution,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “This is a clear signal of support to those who are suffering from the severe impact of the tariffs imposed by the USTR, especially at a time when industries are hard hit by the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9944323897361755}",negative,0.9944323897361755,-1
Airbus launches new U.S. Space and Defense company - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5ldy1zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlLWNvbXBhbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has established an independent company structured specifically to do business with the U.S. government, based partially on the success of offering commercial helicopters to the U.S. Army for training and utility missions.

Announced July 15, Airbus U.S. Space & Defense will operate under a Special Security Agreement (SSA) with the U.S. government that will allow the independent entity to offer commercial products and services directly to military customers. CEO Chris Emerson, formerly president of Airbus Helicopters, says the move was based on the success of building the UH-72 Lakota — based on the commercial H145 — for the U.S. Army.

“We’re delivering to them off a commercial line,” Emerson said of the Lakota during a July 15 conference call with reporters to announce the new venture. “In Columbus, Mississippi, we built Army helicopters and H125s right in the same building, right across the aisle from each other. Employees can cross and work on commercial one day, [and] military another day. That really lowers the cost and makes a cost-competitive offering for the Army. We don’t want to impact that, so we’ll continue to rely on the commercial industrial base, but the modification, support, [and] the contracting will all be done by Airbus U.S.”

The new organization plans to use the Lakota business model as a template for offering capabilities in low-cost satellite design and manufacturing, space exploration, geospatial intelligence, space-based sensors and equipment, secure communications and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite technology.

“As we looked at the future and we looked at the requirements as they were growing with the National Guard and the Army, we couldnt meet those requirements not being under this trusted foundation of an SSA,” Emerson said. “In discussions with Airbus and our commitment to the Army, we made a decision that I would move into the SSA company. I would pull with me the rest of the Airbus business, the non-helicopter business … and take with me the military helicopters part.”

Scott Tumpak, currently vice president of military programs for Airbus Helicopters, and his team will move under the Airbus U.S. umbrella sometime this summer.

Based on recent U.S. government funding for the Airbus OneWeb Satellites venture to manufacture small satellites in mass quantities, Emerson also wants to position the new business to meet the growing demands of the U.S. space market, blending Airbus’s expertise in space systems and exploration with commercial investments.

“We also will have access to all our global business units around the world and all of their products and services, not to mention the billions in self-funded R&D that Airbus invests every year,” he added. “By tapping into commercial innovations that are ready now, we can get products and services to [the government] today at high quality and a very affordable price because we have already developed and are mass producing much of that in the marketplace.”

Operating under the SSA with the U.S. government allows the new Airbus U.S. Space & Defense to deliver products and services that support highly sensitive national security and defense requirements. All of Airbus’s existing government contracts like the UH-72 and all other Airbus Helicopters U.S. military work will now fall under the new entity, Emerson said.

The company has current contracts with NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and all of the service branches of the U.S. military.

“Because Airbus is based in Europe, in order for us to establish the trust and bona fides to be able to work at every security with the U.S. government, we needed to set up an independent board of directors that is independent of Airbus,” Emerson said. He has assembled an almost entirely new leadership team, including industry veterans and current U.S. Airbus executives.

The new Independent board of directors includes:

Letitia Long – former director of the NGA

Frank Miller – former Department of Defense (DOD) senior executive

and special assistant to President George W. Bush

and special assistant to President George W. Bush Retired General William L. Shelton, U.S. Air Force – former commander of the Air Force

Under this Project, the Commonwealth of Australia is seeking a fleet of helicopters to support the Australian Defence Force’s Special Operations.

Bringing together Australia’s best industry capabilities and academia, the Team Nightjar members include: Cablex, Cyborg Dynamics, Deakin University, DEWC, ECLIPS, Ferra Engineering, Helicopter Logistics, Helimods, Kinetic Fighting, Kratos Australia, Microflite, PREDICT Australia, QinetiQ Australia, Safran Helicopter Engines Australia, Seeing Machines, Sigma Bravo, Rusada, TAFE NSW, Tagai Management Consultants, Toll Helicopters, University of Technology Sydney, Varley Group and Varley Rafael Australia.



In response to the Commonwealth of Australia’s request for proposal for a four-tonne class, rapidly deployable, multi-role helicopter for the Australian Special Forces, Team Nightjar will be offering a fleet of the highly capable Airbus H145M and in-country support.



“We recognise the importance of working with Australian companies on this programme, with each partner offering niche capabilities to the Commonwealth. Building on our established commitment to Australian industry, Team Nightjar will have a strong focus on Australian industrial support and innovation,” said Andrew Mathewson, Managing Director of Airbus Australia Pacific.



The local consortium will deliver world leading training solutions, empower indigenous participation, and enable rapid design and delivery of enhancements throughout the programme’s lifetime.



With a clear commitment to invest in Australian-led innovation, the teaming proposal will generate over AUD250 million of economic benefits and more than 170 Australian jobs.



“We believe these capabilities will greatly enhance the core offering of the very capable H145M helicopter, while providing local jobs, technology transfer and export opportunities.”



“The Commonwealth is seeking a proven, mature and highly reliable off-the-shelf platform and robust support systems. The H145M that we are proposing is the latest member of the H145 family, which has flown over 5.9 million hours with more than 1,400 aircraft in service globally across civil, parapublic and military domains. It is well supported by a mature global network.”

“The H145M is an exemplar platform for light special operations and is a solid match for the Special Forces’ requirements, with proven capabilities for no-fail, high-readiness missions,” added Mathewson.

The light twin-engine aircraft is an operationally proven, affordable and low-risk option for Australia, complementing the MRH90 Taipan with improved mobility and situational awareness for special operations. By virtue of its compact size, the H145M will be optimised for operations within dense urban terrain and will be rapidly deployable via a C-17A Globemaster.

The H145M is tried and tested and is gaining popularity among defence forces due to its excellent price-performance ratio and the short delivery time, counting military forces in Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Serbia and Thailand as customers.

In particular, the H145M is today supporting special operations roles with the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) with mission readiness of above 99%, delivering safety and superior power and payload.

Airbus has nearly two decades of presence in Australia, building extensive local industrial capabilities and network, in support of the country’s defence and commercial aviation. With a strong local team of more than 1,500 employees working across 23 sites for civil and military fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft, the company has injected over A$1.7 billion of activities into the Australian aerospace industry, including A$100 million of direct investments from ARH Tiger and MRH90 projects.

Australia’s smallest nocturnal bird of prey, the nightjar’s characteristics include agility, stealth through its compact size, excellent camouflage, silence in flight and non-reflective eyes. The nightjar is known to hunt in pairs, and catch prey on the wing, combining its heightened senses, agility, speed, power and focus – characteristics which are critical for Special Operations. With close resemblance to Airbus’ H145M, the Australian nightjar is adopted as the inspiration for the team’s response to Project LAND 2097 Phase 4.

By Nancy J. Gonzalez

Airbus has a long relationship with Mexico. The French company not only manufactures some components in Mexico, but also Airbus aircraft dominate the Mexican sky by being the brand of choice of Mexican airlines. The company has more than 60% market share of the country’s in-service fleet in commercial aviation. In the next decade, Airbus forecasts to deliver 200 commercial planes to airlines such as Volaris, VivaAerobus, and Interjet and, once those planes are in service, the company’s fleet in Mexico might be up to 70% of the market share.

“The Mexico-Airbus relationship has been successful,” said Ricardo Capilla, head of country for Airbus Mexico. “Mexico is going through a change. The focus of the government is public services, making sure whatever is done serves to society. It matches perfectly what the products of Airbus are. Our products are there to transport people, to fight insecurity, to search and rescue, and to communicate.”

In Mexico, Airbus employs directly 700 people across its three divisions. Airbus has also generated more than 5,000 indirect jobs through its supply

chain.

Moreover, Mexico is also the largest operator of Airbus military transport aircraft in Latin America, with 22 military aircraft in service and an in-service fleet of more than 170 helicopters. In 2018, Airbus delivered 44% of the helicopters in Mexico. Nowadays, there are more than 420 Airbus helicopters flying in the region served from Mexico in civil, parapublic and military configurations.

Mexico also serves as the headquarters of the Latin America offices for the Airbus Defence and Space Secure Line Communications (SLC) business unit.

In 2013, Airbus opened an industrial plant in Queretaro to manufacture emergency exit and bulk cargo doors for Airbus commercial aircraft, as well as structural parts of the Airbus Ecureuil AS350 helicopter. The volume of production went up from 100 doors in 2013, to a current capacity of 4,000 pieces yearly.

“Mexico has a very strategic location in terms of regional competitiveness. This is very interesting for our global supply chain,” explained Capilla. “We

mainly produce doors here, but in the future, it can be even more diversified products. We also source from here to all over the country. The industry is going through a booming period; we have a lot of aircraft delivery and this pulls up the supply chain. Mexico is strategic in that sense.”

Marc Vibes, director of Strategic Procurements at Airbus, said the supply chain in Mexico must be strengthened because there are plenty of opportunities within the industry.

Some of the areas he considers critical are composing in titanium, aerostructures and special treatments. Even though Mexico has some suppliers in these areas, Vibes believes they are not enough to supply to the industry or they have limited capacity or are in the process of improving their quality.

“We have studied the new nanoengineering technology for carbon fibers within Airbus. This should be injected in the supply chain also in Mexico,”

Vibes expressed. “There are many other things such as automation. Automation is critical because the number of volumes is increasing. The supply chain needs to be ready to meet this demand.

This is why we need to step up in new technologies.”

Capilla said the growth would be organic because as more aircraft is delivered, the supply chain will be benefited from this activity.

“Airbus also believes and trusts Mexico in terms of its industry capabilities. We do work together with the whole industry stakeholders to continue to improve the global supply chain, and to improve Airbus’s global supply chain. However, the speed in which we integrate the global supply chain will be also be determined by that access to market,” Capilla added.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced Airbus to reduce its aircraft production, but the company has not disclosed yet how this measure will impact its Mexican facility.

Even though training is not part of Airbus core capabilities, the company has also trusted in Mexico for this endeavor. The Airbus Training Centre

Mexico houses a full-suite of A320 pilot training equipment, and has capacity for more than 1,000 trainees annually—offering pilot-type rating, recurrent and maintenance training for the A320 Family.

Officially opened in September 2016, Airbus Training Centre Mexico is the result of an agreement between Airbus and ASA, a federal agency overseeing the management, operations and development of Mexican airports.

“Training centers are not a core competence or core business for Airbus, but they are part of our social contribution,” Capilla said. “It is very important to contribute towards the right training and to form the right pilots to fly those helicopters in very different conditions.”

Furthermore, the ‘ab initio’ Pilot Cadet Training Programme, co-developed by Airbus and France’s ENAC civil aviation university, supports airline customers in contributing to the long-term availability of qualified pilots. With the ‘ab initio’ training programme, once cadets complete their initial training, they can finish in the Airbus Mexico Training Centre to become fully qualified A320 pilots on the Airbus A320.

Capilla said the Mexico-Airbus relationship is strong enough and based in mutual trust and reciprocity.

“We have always partnered with Mexico and we will continue to do so. Mexico believes and trusts our products; therefore, they use them and purchase them,” Capilla highlighted.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the aerospace industry, thus, companies are still evaluating future global investment and at this moment it is not possible to know if Airbus plans to increase its investment in the country.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999384880065918}",neutral,0.999384880065918,0
Taking control: Airbus's Non-Pilot Emergency Landing Training Course - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Rha2luZy1jb250cm9sLWFpcmJ1cy1ub24tcGlsb3QtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctdHJhaW5pbmctY291cnNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"That first moment when you push the cyclic and feel the rotors respond is pretty magical. After eight years of editing a helicopter magazine, that moment finally arrived for me on a beautifully clear summer’s day just south of Grand Prairie, Texas, last year. I was in an Airbus Helicopters H125 at the time, about 1,200 feet off the ground, with the aircraft in straight and level flight.

“I’m going to give you just the cyclic,” said Airbus Helicopters Inc. instructor pilot Kent Stevens, who was sat to my right. “I have the cyclic,” I responded, as practiced. Every muscle in my right arm tensed as my hand closed in a vice-like grip of the cyclic. After a few seconds, Stevens asked me to make a slight left bank to aim for a point in the distance. I very gradually willed the cyclic left and felt the strange sensation as the aircraft actually responded to my movements. The effort required to do so made me remember I was supposed to use relaxed hands with the controls, so that I could more easily make small, gentle — not jerky — movements. The following right bank was much easier, as I noticed, in a way I had never done before as a passenger, the pull and power of the rotors above, with the airframe below just tagging along for the ride.

I kept a close eye on the horizon in relation to the compass above the control panel to try to keep the aircraft in level flight, with regular glances at my altitude on the Garmin G500 display in front of me to make sure I wasn’t drifting too high or low. We remained around 1,200 feet at 85 knots. “See how I’m not really using the collective and pedals?” said Stevens. I made a mental note not to make excessive use of the collective and pedals. “I’m going to let you take over the rest of the controls,” he said. “I have all controls,” I replied. I was (technically) flying!

As my comfort level grew along with my belief that I wasn’t putting the aircraft and its occupants in severe and immediate danger, I tried a few more banks. On one of these, the rotor bit the air harder than I had intended or anticipated, and I felt the reassuring and immediate counter input from Stevens to lessen the angle. There was no panic on his part, but for me it served as a reminder of the immense power at my fingertips — and my inability to control that power.

Those magical first few minutes were an adrenaline-spiked mixture of intimidating and exhilarating — and that was with a decent amount of preparation, a qualified instructor pilot on the other end of dual controls, and the prior knowledge that I was about to fly a helicopter. Thankfully, almost all first time pilots have these luxuries… but there are exceptions. We featured one such story in Vertical Valor (then known as Vertical 911) early last year (see p.58 Winter 2019 issue). On that occasion, one of the medical crewmembers in the back of a Bell 206L LongRanger had to climb into the cockpit to help the pilot control the helicopter after he became incapacitated. It’s easy to imagine that the first few seconds of helicopter command under these type of circumstances are distinctly less magical and a whole lot more terrifying.

It was for this reason that I was at the controls of the H125 in the first place, after Airbus Helicopters Inc. had invited me to observe its newly-rebranded Non-Pilot Emergency Landing Training Course (NPELT). The title may not roll off the tongue, but it’s a spot-on description of the course’s objective. In just five days, it aims to teach non-pilots the fundamentals of how to safely recover a helicopter from an unusual attitude and fly it, navigate to an airport through some basic GPS use, perform emergency communications, and attempt a running landing. Hovering, it turns out, is quite hard, requiring a skillset well beyond that which students could develop over this short program. So we’d be aiming for a more agricultural end to the flight rather than the graceful hover across the airstrip most of us are used to seeing.

Still, it’s a sizeable amount to learn and attempt to teach, and Stevens and the Airbus training management are under no pretenses as to the scale of the task facing students in this scenario.

“The thing to remember is, we’re not trying to take a person from ‘unable to do it’ to ‘able to do it.’ We’re trying to build the confidence to try,” said Stevens. “And that is the feedback that we get from almost everybody that comes through, is: ‘Man, I have a serious confidence boost here.’ ”

Getting the angles right

The NPELT course is delivered in a mixture of ground school (six hours), simulator flight (2.4 hours), and flight in the H125 (three hours).

After observing a CBP class complete the first three hours of ground school I was given the opportunity to have some sim time, to get familiar with the cockpit, controls and panels; get a feel for flying the aircraft; and perform the running landing.

Up in the real aircraft, once I’d become somewhat comfortable with the controls, we began practicing recovery from unusual angles. The idea behind this being that if a pilot becomes incapacitated, it’s highly likely the aircraft will not be in straight and level flight by the time the person in the co-pilot seat realizes what has happened.

Stevens illustrated the process with the first couple. “There is an order we do this in,” he said. “Correct the bank, then the pitch. Then make sure you’ve got enough power to stay away from the ground. If not, gently raise the collective.”

Thanks to entering the maneuvers with decent airspeed, when it came to my turn, the cyclic was all that was required to put us back into safe and level flight. Stevens pointed the aircraft with a slight nose up, right bank attitude and handed over the controls. Correct bank (inch left); correct pitch (inch forward). It seemed straightforward enough; for my part, I was just happy that my corrections weren’t causing us to see-saw back and forth. A second recovery had us in a slight nose down, left bank. Correct bank (inch right); correct pitch (inch back). “How’s our altitude?” asked Stevens. “Are we staying away from the ground?” Peering outside, the ground seemed happily distant. We had airspeed. “Yep, we’re good,” I responded.

Stevens wanted to illustrate a recovery from an unusual attitude in a hover, but took the controls himself for this one. Simply correcting the unusual attitude isn’t enough here, he said, as “people taking this course don’t have the skillset required to maintain a hover.” Therefore, they would need to get the aircraft out of the hover, too.

Correct bank; correct pitch; then nose down with slight increase in power (and right pedal to counter the torque) to get airspeed and keep moving. Stevens said that by the end of their third flight, students on the course are typically confident and capable enough to perform this maneuver on their own.

Then we used the navigation equipment to locate the nearest airfield and check its suitability. We programmed in a route to Mid-Way Regional Airport, a quieter airfield about 30 minutes’ drive south of Dallas, to practice our running landings.

The running landing

First off was the demonstration, with me loosely holding the controls to feel the movements required. We flew parallel to the runway as we began our approach, at 90 knots and 600 feet. As we passed the point on the runway at which we’d aim to touch down, Stevens lowered the collective to both slow the aircraft and reduce altitude. With the theoretical point of touchdown 45 degrees behind us, he made a right-hand turn to run parallel to the end of the runway, and then another right-hand turn to line the runway up ahead of us. We were now at 65 knots and 300 feet.

We maintained our course, aiming for the landing spot we’d picked out a little way down the runway. Stevens counted down to 100 feet, and when we reached it, pulled the nose up and reduced power “just a fingernail.” “Eyes out from here on,” he said. From here, it was a matter of maintaining sight picture and gently increasing the power as required. The helicopter kissed the runway and began to slide on its specially reinforced carbide-covered skids. Having never been in a helicopter that had performed a running landing before, what struck me was the sensation and the noise — rather than the angry grinding of metal on the runway surface, it felt incredibly smooth, sounding more like a bobsleigh going down a track. Stevens reduced the power a little to increase the weight on the skids, and then used the pedals to steer. The sounds and the aircraft ground to a stop.

Then we took off again to begin my attempt. Stevens put us parallel to the runway at 600 feet then handed over control. I reduced the power by easing the collective down as we passed the landing spot, pushing a touch on the left pedal, and felt the reassuring guidance of Stevens on his mirrored controls. I aimed for that 45-degree point ahead of the landing spot ahead of us where I could begin the first right turn. “We’re going a touch towards the airport here,” Stevens pointed out. “Just ease us a little to the left.” Oops. Course corrected, we reached the point of the first turn at that 65-knot target, and then it was time to turn for final approach.

“Are we looking too shallow compared to the runway? Are we looking too high like we’re going to overshoot it?” asked Stevens. “No, this looks great. Life is good. We’re just going to keep on trucking.”

The runway ahead looked part terrifying, part welcoming, as it seemingly sped towards us, looming ever larger. Stevens counted down to 100 feet again. Then nose up, reduce power a touch, and keep that sight picture. Eyes would now stay outside, he reminded me, as we glided closer to the ground. “Ok, add a little power — just a touch,” he said. I pulled the collective up a small amount and the helicopter seemingly floated in the air a second, before slowly resuming its decent. Just a few feet off the ground, he asked for a little more collective to slow the descent. “Just a fingernail,” he said. I eased it up, proud of myself for also thinking to push the right pedal in a touch. I didn’t know whether I was in fact making any difference, or simply following Stevens’ inputs, but it didn’t really matter — I felt like I was controlling the helicopter, and the confidence that provided was enormous.

At this point, I was wondering when the ground was going to meet us. When it did, there was no mistaking it — a bit more forceful than the demonstration, along with the sort of “scooch” sound that reminded me of an airliner’s tires touching down, followed by the dragging of the skid down the runway. “Lower the collective to put weight on the skids and steer with the pedals straight down the runway,” Stevens reminded me. Pushing on the left pedal, I was briefly confused as to why we were going off to one side… then I realized that was the wrong pedal. I just had time for a brief correction before we ground to a halt. Collective all the way down, and lock it. Breathe.

Widening the target

The course has been offered by Airbus in one form or another for about a decade. Between 2016 and 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) was the primary customer.

Andrew Pritz, a supervisory air interdiction agent at the CBP’s National Air Training Center, said the organization’s involvement stemmed from a 2015 incident when a CBP aircraft was shot at, and hit, several times while patrolling the Mexican border, forcing it to land. This highlighted the potential danger of pilot incapacitation during a flight, so the agency began looking for a training solution — and found it at Airbus.

Beginning in October 2016, the CBP sent between two and four air enforcement agents (AEAs) every month to complete what was then known as the TFO Emergency Recovery Training Course.

“The feedback has been extremely positive, with many AEAs wishing that it had been available when they first entered the agency,” said Pritz. “Many have requested to attend some sort of recurrent training on an annual or biennial basis.”

Pritz added that the main benefit provided by the training is the confidence it builds.

“Many AEAs were previously hesitant, reluctant, or intimidated by the complexity and skills required to safely pilot a helicopter,” he said. “[The NPELT course] has broken down those barriers and instilled confidence in our AEAs that if the need arises they can take control of an aircraft, navigate to the nearest airport, and perform a safe landing.”

Shortly after Stevens joined Airbus in early 2018, he was tasked with updating the NPELT courseware. Thanks to feedback from the CBP and other instructors, that quickly evolved into an expanded target market. “It turned into, ‘Let’s make this course available to more than just the TFO, let’s make it available to anybody who has access to a second set of controls,’ ” said Stevens.

This could include emergency medical services flight crews, other law enforcement agencies, or those private/business aviation customers who frequently fly with their non-pilot partners.

“We renamed it NPELT so that we can have a broader range of people that can come here,” said Marc Hennes, senior marketing specialist, support and services at Airbus Helicopters, Inc. “Training is all about safety. We can always improve on safety, and we’re always thinking about how can we improve safety, and we thought if more people do this course it could, at some point, be very helpful.”

The NPELT course absolutely has the potential to be lifesaving. For anyone working with or around helicopters, it also offers a wonderful opportunity to experience a “Helicopters 101” in just five days. I’ve been living and breathing helicopters for eight years, and my experience observing the program gave me an invaluable new perspective. Crucially, though — and the whole point of the course — is I feel I would at least have a chance, even if it was just a very small one, if the worst did happen to a pilot and I was in a position to assume control. I would at least have the confidence to try.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999861478805542}",neutral,0.999861478805542,0
First metal cut for the first A321XLR's Rear Centre Tank at Airbus manufacturing subsidiary Premium AEROTEC - Airbus,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA3LWZpcnN0LW1ldGFsLWN1dC1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LWEzMjF4bHJzLXJlYXItY2VudHJlLXRhbmstYXQtYWlyYnVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ manufacturing subsidiary Premium AEROTEC in Augsburg, Germany has commenced production of the first Rear Center Tank (RCT) for the Airbus A321XLR. The ""first metal cut"" – the production of the first machined part for the tank – took place on 25 June 2020. The RCT, which is unique to the new long-range A321XLR, is a permanently installed high-capacity fuel tank that makes maximum volumetric use of the aircraft’s lower fuselage. The RCT structure, which is integrated in fuselage Sections 15 and 17, is located behind the main landing gear bay and holds up to 12,900 litres – which is more fuel than several optional Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs) combined could hold previously in the A321 Family. Moreover, since the RCT takes up less space in the cargo hold, it frees-up underfloor volume for additional cargo and baggage on long range routes of up to an unprecedented 4,700nm.

Premium AEROTEC, which was commissioned by Airbus in September 2019 to manufacture the RCT, will complete the structure’s sub-assembly over the next few months at its factory in Augsburg, Germany. This phase involves production of the other RCT parts, followed by structural assembly, systems equipping and testing prior to delivery to Airbus’ major component assembly (MCA) facility in Hamburg early next year, where the tank will be integrated into the aircraft’s rear fuselage.

In addition to the dedicated RCT, other key changes for the A321XLR include a modified landing gear for an increased maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 101 metric tonnes, uprated brakes, and an optimised wing trailing-edge flap configuration to preserve the same take-off performance and engine thrust requirements as today’s A321neo. By early 2020, the first long-lead components for the initial A321XLR flight-test aircraft were already in production – including the main landing gear forgings by Safran and the first parts for the centre wingbox by Airbus in Nantes.

The A321XLR, the next evolutionary step in Airbus’ single-aisle family, has been designed to maximise overall commonality with the rest of the A320neo Family, while introducing minimal changes needed to give the aircraft an Xtra Long Range with increased revenue payload and best travel experience with the Airspace cabin. To date, 24 customers have ordered a total of more than 450 A321XLRs, validating the market need for the unique capabilities offered by this aircraft. Flight-testing is due to start in 2022, and service entry from 2023. The A321XLR will provide airlines with a range of up to 4,700nm and a 30% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared with previous-generation competitor aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999654293060303}",neutral,0.9999654293060303,0

The eVTOL — which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing — vehicles are more than just a new aircraft for Airbus, they could also change how we choose to get around our cities.

The remotely piloted vehicles, created by the company’s helicopter division, are dubbed as “flying taxis,” with the ability to carry four passengers up to 60 miles at 75 miles per hour

The average trip would not take more than 15 minutes, Business Insider noted.

Sure beats sitting in traffic on your way to work.

According to Time Out, the aircraft will hopefully act as a short-distance method of traveling within urban areas, allowing passengers to fly over traffic and congestion. The vehicles are all-electric and have four propellers and motors.

The CityAirBus could be a new way to think about the future of travel since the aircraft does not need a driver in order to operate. As social distancing is (and may continue to be) a major part of travel during the coronavirus pandemic, being able to hop around town with the minimal amount of personal contact might be a big perk.

These quieter, drone-like vehicles, however, won’t replace helicopters in the sky, though, since they wouldn’t be very practical for sightseeing or taking a trip outside your city.

According to Aviation Today, the vehicles made their first test flight back in December 2019 in Donauwörth, Germany. It’s unclear when these vehicles will be available to the public, but they could be a big part of the urban landscape very soon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999887943267822}",neutral,0.9999887943267822,0

Airbus innovation comes to the aid of caregivers - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWNvbWVzLXRvLXRoZS1haWQtb2YtY2FyZWdpdmVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An innovative app-enabled health monitoring system developed by Airbus for military medevac (medical evacuation) flights is now demonstrating its capabilities in ground-based applications, including the fight against COVID-19.

This system – called the Smart Flying Hospital – was created so that medical personnel can better care for patients onboard lifesaving medevac airlift missions, while simultaneously transmitting data to hospitals on the ground so doctors can anticipate resources before their arrival.

With Airbus’ Smart Flying Hospital, patients insert a sensor into their ear to record the heart rate, breathing rate, temperature and oxygen concentration.

The Smart Flying Hospital will undergo trials onboard an Airbus-built A400M military airlifter during 2021. In addition to its potential use by the military, an estimated 1,300 rescue helicopters and civilian air ambulances could benefit from the system worldwide, along with commercial airliners, according to Ignacio Sanchez Peral, a Control and Monitoring Systems Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.

About 2,000 passengers die annually during long-haul flights; this could be reduced if the Smart Flying Hospital is used on board for initial diagnoses – enabling life-saving measures to be taken quickly.

Ignacio Sanchez Peral, a Control and Monitoring Systems Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space

Airbus’ Smart Flying Hospital is exceptionally easy to use: patients insert a sensor into their ear to record the heart rate, breathing rate, temperature and oxygen concentration. The data is then transmitted wirelessly and in real time to smartphones/tablets of medical staff, who access the data via an app. This relieves the burden on medical personnel and reduces complex wiring, while reducing their risk of being infected while working.

Adapting to COVID-19

When the COVID-19 outbreak took on a global scale earlier this year, employees at Airbus’ Getafe, Spain site – including Sanchez Peral – recognised that the Smart Flying Hospital could help save lives in this new context, and they immediately took action.

After demonstrating the Smart Flying Hospital’s primary capabilities to health care providers in Spain, trials were set up at two facilities – La Paz University Hospital and Madrid Health Center Quince de Mayo – both of which have shown extremely promising results.

Feedback received for Airbus’ Smart Flying Hospital guides further improvements for this app-enabled health monitoring system

“It helps us monitor patients at a distance, 24 hours a day,” explained Dr. Ana Pertejo Fernández, of La Paz University Hospital. “If we detect, for example, that a patient has a fever or that the oxygen saturation has dropped, we can intervene more rapidly, improving the treatment and making things much easier for us and the patient.”

Supporting hospitals and patients

Dr. Roberto Garcia Zurita, a doctor at the Madrid Health Center Quince de Mayo, said many patients – including families and elderly people over 70 years old – previously had to wait up to three hours for their health check. “Now they get the ‘button’ in their ear, carefully cleaned beforehand, of course,” he added. “If the values are correct, they can save themselves the long wait, go home again after just one hour and do not need to expose themselves to unnecessary risks.”

According to Airbus’ Sanchez Peral, feedback from the two hospitals has been incredibly valuable for developing further improvements for the Smart Flying Hospital.

In the midst of the biggest health crisis we’ve ever faced, a quick solution was needed to solve major problems. The Smart Flying Hospital proved its worth immediately.

Dr. Javier de Castro Carpeño, Head of Experimental Therapies and Biomarkers, La Paz University Hospital

The Smart Flying Hospital concept originated in 2019, when Airbus engineers submitted a proposal in the framework of the company’s Blue Box innovation initiative. From the more than 400 ideas that were submitted that year, the Smart Flying Hospital placed in the top 10.

After a pitch to the Executive Committee of Airbus Defence and Space, the project team received the “green light,” plus financing for a prototype. The Smart Flying Hospital team is supported by Airbus’ ProtoSpace innovation incubator, which has facilities at Getafe, and in Manching, Germany.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7990148067474365}",positive,0.7990148067474365,1

Is There Interest In A Larger Airbus A220-500? - Aviation Week,"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi90aGVyZS1pbnRlcmVzdC1sYXJnZXItYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtNTAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, momentum seemed to be gathering for the launch of a larger Airbus A220-500. Is that still likely?

Aviation Week Executive Editor, Commercial Aviation, Jens Flottau responds:

Yes, Airbus will likely further stretch the A220 (formerly the Bombardier C Series). But when that will happen is another question. At the start of 2020, it appeared the proposed -500 would be launched within 2-3 years, given that the A220 program was expected to become profitable at relatively high production rates by 2025. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has stalled most spending on aircraft development—with the exception of the A321XLR. Airbus will now almost certainly delay any launch of the -500 by several years. Besides conserving cash, such a slip might also buy time for the company to introduce new technologies to the A220 that it has been developing for future aircraft.

From a strategic point of view, an A220-500 would give Airbus a competitive aircraft family at the lower end of the narrowbody market, reaching into Boeing 737-8 territory. That would allow Airbus to begin a clean-sheet successor to the A320 family at 180 seats or higher, capitalizing on growing demand for bigger narrowbodies. By contrast, Boeing would have to cover the entire narrowbody segment with just one family, the 737 MAX, now that it has scuttled a proposed acquisition of Embraer Commercial that would have added the smaller E2 family to its lineup.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995065927505493}",neutral,0.9995065927505493,0

"Supply Chain Situation Manageable, Airbus CEO Says - Aviation Week","Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXNpdHVhdGlvbi1tYW5hZ2VhYmxlLWFpcmJ1cy1jZW8tc2F5c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LYON, France—As production rates have suddenly decreased amid the COVID-19 crisis, Airbus’ suppliers are in a difficult but still viable situation, according to Guillaume Faury, the airframer’s CEO.

On the company’s half-year earnings media conference call July 30, Faury was asked about the ability of suppliers to get through the crisis and Airbus’ assistance. His answer was relatively reassuring, describing supply chain survival as achievable and alluding to the industry’s efforts to support it.

Airbus has 3,200 suppliers of aircraft parts “and we need all of them in a good shape,” he said.

The current on-time delivery performance of some suppliers has improved because the lower production rate has given them the opportunity to catch up with delays. But they could be seen as being in the “eye of the storm.” After the transition from high to low production levels, “they will suffer from financial pressure,” Faury said.

Airbus has intensified the exchange of information to better anticipate the situation of the supply chain, he explained. The manufacturer “intervened in some cases” to help with a particular predicament.

“With this level of production, it is very likely the supply chain will make it, we are in an area that is ... challenging but manageable,” Faury said.

To support ailing small and medium enterprises (SME), a dedicated fund has just been formed in France. ACE Management, a subsidiary of Parisian asset manager Tikehau, was chosen to manage the new ACE Aéro Partenaires fund and has invested €230 million ($270 million)—more than the expected €100 million. Other contributions have come from Airbus, Dassault, Safran, Thales and the French government for a combined €630 million. The ultimate objective is to raise a total €1 billion.

The fund will help those SMEs that need equity capital and may be instrumental in the overdue consolidation of the supply chain. “We will now get to work to help secure, reorder and strengthen the supply chain of this highly innovative industry,” said Ace Management executive chairman Marwan Lahoud, who was previously Airbus’ chief strategy and marketing officer.

At the end of June, 145 Airbus commercial aircraft could not be delivered because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Airbus aircraft deliveries are gradually resuming.

“We delivered 36 aircraft in June and keep recovering in July,” Faury said. “You will see the majority of our usual customer names by the end of the year,” including Chinese carriers, he added.

The airframer is now operating in a “new normal” mode, as production rate cuts have been implemented. “Our industrial system, including our supply chain, has adjusted to new levels and we are producing according to the new plan,” Faury said. Drastic measures have begun to yield results, such as partly offsetting lower revenues, he pointed out.

“We face a difficult situation with uncertainty ahead, but with the decisions we have taken, we believe we are adequately positioned to navigate these challenging times in our industry,” Faury said.

During the third quarter, Airbus is bringing production and deliveries to the same level. Major adaptations happened in the second quarter and minor ones are now occurring every month, Faury said. The A350’s monthly production has been cut to five, down from six.

Ramping up again is not expected in 2020 or early 2021. “We believe single-aisle production will increase in 2022 and it will take more time for widebodies,” Faury said. “It will be a long and slow recovery.”

In Toulouse, a new A320/A321 final assembly line (FAL), coming in addition to two existing A319/A320 FALs, was expected to deliver its first aircraft, an A321, in 2022. That plan is now on hold. A member of the French parliament, Toulouse area deputy Mickael Nogal, has launched a campaign to firm up the project.

He is supported by the local chamber of commerce, business lobbying groups Medef, CPME and UIMM, as well as the CFE-CGC, CFTC and FO workers unions. Their stated goal is to obtain a commitment from Airbus about an A321 FAL in Toulouse and financial incentives from local authorities. Nogal emphasized the FAL would generate employment and would help weakened suppliers.

Airbus’ commercial aircraft deliveries were halved in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. A total 196 aircraft were delivered, comprising 11 A220s, 157 A320 family aircraft, five A330s and 23 A350s. After the addition of a net eight aircraft orders in the second quarter, the backlog stood at 7,584 commercial aircraft, as of June 30.

Airbus’ consolidated net loss amounted to €1.9 billion in the first half. That came against a backdrop of slashed revenues, down to €18.9 billion—a substantial drop on the €30.9 billion the company achieved in the first half of 2019. Those numbers combine Airbus’ civil, defense and space activities, but the decline in commercial aircraft business drove the slump.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6718810796737671}",neutral,0.6718810796737671,0
Airbus reveals H145M bid plan for Australian special forces helo competition - Defense News,"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy8yMDIwLzA3LzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxzLWgxNDVtLWJpZC1wbGFuLWZvci1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXNwZWNpYWwtZm9yY2VzLWhlbG8tY29tcGV0aXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Airbus will offer its H145M helicopter on July 11 for Australia’s special operations support helicopter program, the company’s Australia Pacific managing director confirmed Thursday.

“We’re excited to have the opportunity to present the H145M as part of [Project] Land 2097 Phase 4,” Andrew Mathewson said. “We have a fantastic opportunity to offer an aircraft which has a family heritage of over 5 million flight hours of operations.”

Mathewson noted that the helicopter is currently used by the German Army’s special forces.

With its bid, Airbus will become the second contender in the competition, behind an industry team of Bell and Babcock Australia, which is proposing a militarized version of the Bell 429 commercial helicopter. The team announced its intention to bid on May 28. Bell is also partnering with Hawker Pacific for Land 2097 Phase 4 and has independent teams working on each bid.

Other contenders are likely to include Boeing’s AH-6i Little Bird; MD Helicopters’ MD530G; and Leonardo Helicopters, but neither company has publicly declared its intent to participate.

The Australian Defence Force is seeking an off-the-shelf helicopter in the 4-ton class to support the Army’s special forces, primarily in their domestic counterterrorism role. Australia plans to buy up to 16 aircraft to provide an air assault capability for small teams within the special forces, and a fast-roping system to rapidly deliver troops while hovering.

Secondary roles include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, fire support, and general utility. A weapons capability is optional.

Four helicopters are required to fit in a single C-17A airlifter and be capable of rapid deployment from the Australian Army’s 6th Aviation Regiment base at Holsworthy, outside Sydney. The regiment currently operates the NHIndustries-made MRH-90 Taipan in a special forces support role, and the new helicopter is to complement that capability.

Deliveries are expected to begin in 2022.

For its planned bid, Airbus Australia Pacific has teamed with 15 local suppliers to meet the Australian Industry Capability policy, which calls for defense suppliers to include local industry in their efforts. Those domestic companies include Safran Australia, Qinetiq Australia, HeliMods, Toll Helicopters, Helicopter Logistics, Sigma Bravo and Thales. The company has also entered a strategic partnership with Deakin University, near Melbourne, to develop innovative solutions and modifications throughout the H145Ms’ proposed 25-year life span.

Mathewson says Airbus Australia Pacific has also offered seven H145Ms to the commonwealth, which, together with a series of technology inserts to the Australian Army’s Tiger helicopters, is an independent bid to meet the requirements of Land 4503 (for armed reconnaissance helicopters).

Airbus’ expensive A380 problem | Best of 2020 - AeroTime,"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU1NDktYWlyYnVzLWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1hMzgwLXByb2JsZW3SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI1NTQ5LWFpcmJ1cy1leHBlbnNpdmUtYTM4MC1wcm9ibGVtL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article was initially publihsed on July 30, 2020.

For Airbus, the A380 was supposed to become the flagship aircraft of the 21 century. At the start of the 2000s, the announced double-decker was supposed to take over the Boeing 747 on the royalty throne, becoming the icon of aviation throughout the next decades. Instead, it became a problem for the manufacturer.

And an expensive one, at that.

Exceptional charges

Every aviation geek will remember February 14, 2019, as a very bittersweet Valentine’s Day. As Emirates shrank its order book, Airbus had no other choice but to announce the cancellation of the production of the A380. After all, its only remaining customers at the time were All Nippon Airways (ANA) from Japan and Emirates. ANA’s backlog was small, however, as the Japanese airline ordered three of the Super Jumbos to fly between Japan and Hawaii, a very popular tourist destination for Japanese nationals.

The only customer left was the pride and joy of Dubai, Emirates. On February 14, 2019, the airline reduced its order book by 39 aircraft, leaving Airbus without any choice but to announce the cancelation of production of the A380. The last delivery is scheduled in 2021 for the aforementioned Emirates. Boeing, meanwhile, confirmed that the Boeing 747 will outlast its European Jumbo competitor, as the last Queen will roll out from the Everett plant in 2022.

Ever since the manufacturer was forced to cancel the production of the Airbus A380, the aircraft became a headache for the planemaker, including a financial one. In the same quarter, during which the double-decker was canceled, the company booked a $71.6 million (€61 million) production cost charge, and in Q2 2019, a further $88 million (€75 million). The charge was a part of “Airbus’ continuous assessment of assets recoverability and the quarterly review of onerous contract provision assumptions,” reads the press release.

Throughout 2019 and 2020 the manufacturer booked $627.5 million in charges related to the A380 program. The last time Airbus published its list prices in 2018, the A380 cost $445.6 million. Even then, the price is only indicative – airlines negotiate discounts and concessions when making orders, especially big ones. The last Emirates order that Airbus booked was for 36 aircraft (20 firm, 16 options). At list prices, the acquisition was set at $16 billion.

An unprofitable venture

While 2019 was a good year for Airbus in terms of its financial performance, except the fact it had to take a $3.8 billion (€3.5 billion) corruption charge, 2020 is a much different story. The industry is bleeding cash from the top to the bottom, including the manufacturers.

The Toulouse, France-based manufacturer finished H1 2020 with a net loss of $2.2 billion. The A380 program forced Airbus to write off $390 million in the first six months of 2020 alone.

Yet the pain of the program is not over. Out of the 14 operators, many of them have either shrank their double-decker fleets or retired them permanently. Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) reduced its A380 fleet by six out of its 14 Super Jumbo aircraft, while Air France phased all of them out permanently. Qatar Airways and Qantas put their A380s to long-term storage, while its largest operator, Emirates, only recently began flying them once again.

After Airbus announced that the company will cancel the production of the jet in 2021, the now-former CEO of the manufacturer Tom Enders told CNN that the bill for the A380 would be a “double-digit billion amount of money,” and even despite the constant pouring of resources into the program, “Airbus is very competitive today,” added Enders.

“It was a heavy liability. We tried hard, as I said, it did not work.”

Services

The former chief executive also indicated that the aircraft was selling “only below production cost” at an Airbus press conference in February 2019.

Nevertheless, its glimpse of hope to at least make more money on it would have been the ability to service and maintain the global fleet of the Jumbos. Mark Martin, an aerospace industry analyst, told Arabian Business in an interview that Airbus still had 20 years or so before the A380s all go to a desert to be scrapped, providing at least some service revenue.

“Unless there is a major global economic shakeout that wipes out the very need for the A380, the worldwide A380 fleet should end up in the aircraft boneyard latest by 2040.”

Unfortunately, a major shakeout did happen in the form of the COVID-19 breakout. In 2018, Airbus set out the goal to earn up to $10 billion of service revenue by 2025, tripling its 2018 result of $3.5 billion (€3 billion). In H1 2020, Airbus earned $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion) from services, including the sale of spare parts. During the same period a year prior, the result was $1.8 billion (€1.6 billion). In 2019, the manufacturer earned $3.9 billion (€3.8 billion) of revenue from its services business side.

With the global fleet of A380s shrinking, Airbus‘ opportunities to sell new, rather than used, spare parts are also shrinking.

COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

In an announcement Tuesday, the company said beginning in the last quarter of this year and by no later than next year, they are looking to cut the labor force, including 5,000 workers in France, 5,100 in Germany, 1,700 in Britain, 900 in Spain and 1,300 others at facilities elsewhere.

In France and Spain, government officials sought to minimize the effect on its workers. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters the government was working with Airbus in an attempt find ways to keep jobs in the country.

In France, Junior Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari urged the company to make as few cuts as possible. He said it was possible some 2,000 of the proposed cuts there could be prevented through a reduced-work plan and government investment in next-generation jets.

It its statement, Airbus said it will aim for voluntary resignations and early retirements, but also that compulsory job losses can't be ruled out. Airbus said it is already consulting with unions.

Airbus said its commercial aircraft business activity has plummeted by close to 40 percent as the pandemic shut borders, brought mass tourism to a halt and impacted airlines, hitting hard both the European manufacturer and its U.S.-based rival, Boeing.

The International Air Transport Association reports air travel declined by 94 percent in April, and 91.3 percent in May.

Airbus starts Hamburg deliveries with sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNy1haXJidXMtc3RhcnRzLWhhbWJ1cmctZGVsaXZlcmllcy13aXRoLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLWZ1ZWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hamburg, 17 July 2020 - Airbus is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) operations, now including aircraft deliveries from its site in Hamburg, Germany. Air Transat took delivery of two brand new A321LR on lease from AerCap. Both used a 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel blend to fly the aircraft from Hamburg to Montreal, Canada, non-stop.

Airbus has already successfully established SAF flights out of Hamburg with its Beluga transport aircraft since December 2019. Today’s commercial delivery is another milestone that underlines Airbus’ continuing commitment to minimizing air transportation’s environmental impact – which includes becoming the first aircraft manufacturer offering customers the option of receiving new jetliners with sustainable fuel in their tanks. Such delivery flights have been available since 2016, starting from the Airbus headquarters production facility in Toulouse, France, followed by Mobile, Alabama, USA.

Airbus offers this option as part of its strategy to promote the more regular use of sustainable fuels within the aviation industry. The fuel for Air Transat’s A321LR aircraft delivered from Hamburg was supplied by Air bp and produced by Neste.

Airbus and Air Transat have a long history of cooperation on environmental affairs. Airbus supported the airline to launch its environmental programme 13 years ago and both have worked together on environmental projects such as fuel efficiency. Air Transat has been operating Airbus single-aisle and widebody aircraft since 1999.

""Sustainability and efficiency are essential for our customers and for Airbus. Sustainable aviation fuel developments will play a key role in reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry. By using sustainable aviation fuels on delivery flights with partners like AerCap and Air Transat, who are flying the aircraft from Hamburg to their Canadian homebase nonstop, we take concrete action to contribute to a more sustainable aviation future,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer Airbus.

“We are very pleased to be a part of this historic milestone, working together with our partners at Airbus and with our long-time customer, Air Transat, to help them meet their sustainable growth ambitions,” said Philip Scruggs, President and Chief Commercial Officer of AerCap. “AerCap is committed to facilitating the move towards more sustainable air travel underpinned by its target to transition its fleet to approximately two-thirds new technology aircraft by 2021.”



“It is an honor for us and a sign of confidence from Airbus to be its first customer to take advantage of this new delivery option at its Hamburg plant,” said Jean-François Lemay, President and General Manager, Air Transat. “This initiative is part of our commitment to reducing our own carbon footprint while contributing to the achievement of the airline industry’s ambitious decarbonization targets.”

Both today and tomorrow’s delivery flights will be carbon-neutral because the kerosene fossil fuel portion will be offset by the purchase of carbon credits.

“We are proud to be the first Canadian carrier to operate carbon-neutral flights, and we will continue to pursue our commitment to providing our passengers with a travel experience that takes account of our environmental footprint,” Mr. Lemay continued.

Airbus delivers strong 1H2021 and launches A350 Freighter - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yOS9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtc3Ryb25nLTFoMjAyMS1hbmQtbGF1bmNoZXMtYTM1MC1mcmVpZ2h0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

July 29, 2020, © Leeham News: Airbus presented its results for the first half of 2021 today. The company reported a profit of €2.7bn on a turnover of €24.6bn, a very strong result from the -€0.9bn of last year. Yesterday, the Airbus board gave the go-ahead for the A350 freighter with planned entry into service 2025.

The strong result came from deliveries of 297 commercial aircraft, 100 more than the 196 of 1H2020. Net orders were 38 aircraft (1H2020 196). Guidance for 2021 was increased to 600 airliner deliveries with operating profit at €4bn and Free Cash Flow of €2bn.

Group-level results

Revenue for 1H2021 was €24.6bn (€18.9bn 1H2020), operating profit was €2.7bn (called EBIT adjusted, -€0.9bn 1H2020), and net profit was €2.7bn (-€1.6bn).

Free cash flow for 1H2021 was €2.0bn (-€12.4bn), and the net cash position end 1H2020 was €6.5bn (end 2020 €4.3bn).

Guidance for 2021 is now:

Airbus targets 600 commercial aircraft deliveries for 2021 (was same as 2020 at 566).

Airbus expects an EBIT Adjusted of €4bn (was €2bn)

Free Cash Flow of €2bn (was break-even).

Commercial aircraft

Of the 297 delivered aircraft, 237 was A320/A321, 21 A220, 30 A350, 7 A330 and 2 A380. Orders were at a modest Gross of 165 (365) with a Net of 38 (298) after cancellations. The drop compared to 2020 reflects a pre-COVID market (1H2020) to today’s uncertain situation.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the outlook for air travel is mixed, with increased domestic market demand in the US and China and a modest recovery in the internal EU market. But new virus variants delay recovery time after time and China’s domestic growth has tapered off as pockets of Delta variant infections have re-introduced restrictions.

The big news was the launch of the A350 freighter, with entry into service (EIS) 2025. As we predicted here and here, the freighter will be based on predominately A350-1000 components to cater for a maximum payload “in excess of 90 tonnes”.

Related Article

To understand the rationale for how the freighter is a mix of -1000 and -900 components and why this can minimize the development effort, read the articles. These also predict the operating cost advantage of the A350F over its incumbent competitor, the Boeing 777F.

The development of the freighter will use the more agile development processes from the Beluga XL project, including an integrated digital 3D toolchain from the Airbus DDMS project.

Faury said the market for freighters would boom after 2025 as a replacement wave sets in combined with problems for incumbent freighters as stricter ICAO CO2 rules make these non-compliant for emissions.

Faury emphasized Airbus is continuing its investment in lower carbon footprint technologies such as hydrogen and will lead the airliner industries conversion to such aircraft.

The challenge for Airbus Commercial Aircraft is now to ramp the A220 and A320 programs from today’s rates up to pre COVID rates and then higher. A lot of supplier support is rolled in, including direct financial support to help the supply chain expand after a challenging period since 2Q2020.

Faury said, “The Airbus supply chain is in comparatively good shape as the production was reduced but then remained stable at a rate 40 for the A320 and four for the A220”.

The re-shaping and re-integration of core aerostructures are progressing. The commodity parts company creation is more challenging, with tough negotiations with the involved unions. Airbus would ideally merge this into an external activity, said Faury, to gain the benefits of scale for these more commoditized products.

Helicopters

The helicopter market is recovering and the division increased revenue 11% to €2.6bn and profits 20% to €0.2bn.

Defense and Space

Revenues were stable at €4.5bn, with a €0.2bn profit.

Two A440M were delivered in 1H2020.

Airbus' H160 multi-role helicopter awarded EASA certification - New Atlas,"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy1oMTYwLW11dGxpLXJvbGUtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZWFzYS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters' multi-role H160 helicopter has received type certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Three prototypes of the twin-engine rotorcraft have completed over 1,500 hours of test and demonstration flights and it is now expected to gain US FAA certification before commercial deliveries begin later this year.

Introduced at the Heli-Expo in Orlando, Florida in March 2015, the H160 is the latest generation of Airbus' H family of helicopters, building on the legacies of the H145 and H175 and replacing the company's AS365 and EC155 models. Since 2015, the H160 has been undergoing flight tests in the run-up to entering service this year in both civilian and military variants.

According to Airbus, the H160 is designed to carry out a wide variety of missions, including offshore transportation, emergency medical services, private and business aviation, and public services. It boasts a composite fuselage and includes the Helionix pilot assistance and automated systems, as well as a sound-reducing Blue Edge double-swept five-bladed main rotor – the first on a rotorcraft. It is also the first civilian helicopter to use a canted Fenestron anti-torque tail rotor. In addition, the conventional hydraulic landing gear is replaced by electric components to make it lighter and safer.

Deliveries of the Airbus H160 are scheduled to start later this year Airbus Helicopters

The H160 has a crew of two and can carry up to 12 passengers or a payload of 1,760 kg (3,880 lb). It's powered by two Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines and has a main rotor diameter of 12 m (39 ft). In flight, it has a maximum speed of 175 kn (325 km/h, 202 mph), cruises at 155 kn (287 km/h, 178 mph), has a range of 460 nm (85 km, 530 mi), and a service ceiling of 19,000 ft (5,900 m).

""We are proud that the H160 has received its EASA type certificate,"" says Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. ""This achievement represents years of hard work designing, industrializing and defining the support ecosystem with our suppliers and partners, and I would like to thank everyone who has dedicated their time and energy to turning this next generation helicopter into reality. I now look forward to the H160 entering into service and offering its innovative features that bring competitiveness alongside additional comfort and safety to customers worldwide.""

A CityAirbus probably means nothing to you now unless you're an aviation expert but soon you might come to recognise the name as easily as you would Uber and Lyft. It refers to the flying taxi that Airbus is currently developing to allow for speedy and more direct air travel for passengers in major cities across the globe, bypassing bottlenecks and traffic jams in rush hour to reach destinations like airports and train stations in a jiffy.

The CityAirbus can carry four passengers ©Airbus

Last week Airbus flew the eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft) in public for the first time – after more than 100 private test flights – at a demonstration in its Donauwörth factory in Germany. The vehicle is equipped to carry four passengers comfortably (ideal for ridesharing) and can travel up to 75 miles (120 km) per hour. The engine is fully electric and battery powered making it environmentally friendly and its four-ducted propeller configuration creates less noise than a traditional helicopter.

There's no confirmed date for when it will be in regular use – air taxi companies face rounds of testing and sign-offs from officials before they can even think about taking to the skies – but when it does eventually launch it will initially be pilot-operated before gradually evolving to become a fully-autonomous flight.

Airbus has competition from the likes of Uber Air, who announced plans last year to expand its flying taxi service to Australia. Uber Air is expected to launch in 2023, with Melbourne joining Dallas and Los Angeles as pilot locations for the service.

- Unique solution to help airports meet TALPA and GRF requirements, enhancing landing safety

- Based on NAVBLUE’s BACF+ software transforming aircraft into a sensor

- More than 10 airlines have signed up, representing more than 880 aircraft

NAVBLUE is pleased to announce the launch of the RunwaySense service,allowing airlines and airports to accurately assess and report runway conditions by using Airbus aircraft as a sensor.

Airports can use the aircraft data to inform their runway clearing operations, better timing runway clearing activities or targeting application of de-icing chemicals. Furthermore, with the mandatory ICAO Global Reporting Format (GRF), due to come into effect in November 2020, this data contributes to airports reporting requirements with accurate, near real-time runway performance information.

Airlines can use this data to better monitor their operations as they share the data their aircraft have generated internally, or access data generated by other operators.

RunwaySense is based on BACF+ (Braking Action Computation Function), software released by NAVBLUE in 2019 on the Airbus single-aisle family. BACF+ generates a message on the aircraft accurately reporting the condition of the runway it’s just landed on, against the FAA’s Take-off and Landing Performance Assessment (TALPA) Runway Condition Assessment Matrix (RCAM). This data, already available to the pilot through the MCDU (Multi Function Control and Display Unit), will now be accessible from NAVBLUE via dedicated channels which can be selected to best fit the user’s operational requirements.

Users will be able to access the data via a NAVBLUE web-based tool or an Application Programming Interface (API) allowing them to integrate the data feed into their existing software platforms.

“RunwaySense is a truly unique solution – the only one using actual aircraft performance information to assess the runway conditions,” said Thomas Lagaillarde, NAVBLUE VP Programmes / Portfolio. “By transforming the aircraft into a sensor we’re maximising the airports' knowledge of their runway performance and therefore increasing safety for aircraft and airports. More than 10 airlines, in Europe, the Americas, Asia Pacific and Africa, have signed up for BACF+ and the number of aircraft transmitting data continues to grow. We believe the community model of sharing data is the right direction of travel for all aviation stakeholders: airlines, airports and crucially the passenger will benefit from this new technology.”

RunwaySense is the first of NAVBLUE’s airport-focussed solutions to be launched and will be followed in the coming months by AirportCore, a web platform leveraging big data to help airports better anticipate delays and congestion.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9220836162567139}",positive,0.9220836162567139,1

First flights fuelled are two A321LR on lease to Air Transat from AerCap.



Air bp, the international aviation fuel products and service supplier, is collaborating with Airbus to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for delivery flights from Airbus’ facility at Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (XFW/EDHI). The first aircraft are two Air Transat A321LR destined for Montreal, Canada.



To enable SAF to be used for these flights, Air bp established a supply route, including transportation and storage facilities at the airport. As part of this agreement, Air bp also supplied SAF for transportation flights from Hamburg by the Airbus A300-600ST Beluga in December 2019.

Martin Thomsen, CEO, Air bp, said:

We are excited to extend our collaboration with Airbus to fuel delivery flights from Hamburg for the first time with sustainable aviation fuel, building on previous delivery flights from Mobile, Alabama. bp’s ambition is to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world to get to net zero. We believe SAF is one of the aviation industry’s key routes to reducing carbon emissions and we are committed to supporting our customers to realise their low carbon ambitions.

The SAF supplied is produced by Neste and is made from non-palm renewable and sustainable raw materials and can reduce up to 80% of greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel.



Air bp has been supplying SAF since 2010 and to date has supplied 16 airports and 20 customers globally. Air bp has been supplying SAF to Germany since late 2019.



In 2018, Air bp agreed a collaboration with Neste to develop SAF supply chains, and in 2016 invested $30 million in waste to fuels company Fulcrum BioEnergy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999880790710449}",neutral,0.9999880790710449,0

Did Airbus make any customer service network changes over the last year? If so, what were they?

Airbus, especially in the customer services side, has a strong regional network of people and infrastructure placed in many worldwide locations. The most significant change we made late last year was to reinforce our Africa Middle East region and our Dubai-based customer services teams. This includes customer support, supplier support, engineering, quality, aircraft structure embodiment and repair services sales and marketing, flight training and flight operations. They are co-located to better serve African and Middle East carriers, lessors and MROs and the fleet of more than 1,000 aircraft there. The Africa Middle East team joins our regional concentrations in China, Asia-Pacific, South Asia, Latin America, North America, and of course, Europe.

How are you handling the day to day, and do you have any projections for the rate of recovery?

It is premature to predict precisely how, where, how fast and under what conditions operations will resume. Nevertheless, Airbus is trying to remain both agile and proactive in the meantime, to anticipate and meet customer needs.

We continue to support our customers via remote and on-site technical assistance when required and via our AOG resolution center, which never stopped operating 24 hours per day, seven days a week. Airbus also considers customer proximity a key aspect of our service; we have teams in all main world regions close to customer bases and we intend to maintain such an organization. This proximity is highly appreciated by our customers during the crisis.

Are you seeing changes to digital services because of the pandemic?

The current crisis highlights the relevance of digital solutions to provide airlines with ever more efficient means to manage fleet performance in real time and in a tailored manner--helping airlines to make the most of their sometimes reduced or constrained resources. We have thus accelerated our digital services, such as our Skywise-based Parking Management App, which helps customers to administer their fleet in terms of aircraft location, maintenance needs, and storage procedures by “tagging” their grounded aircraft in Skywise, and virtually parking them into airports/stations (hangar, gate, taxiway, etc.). They can then quickly pull contextual data such as the aircraft's age, latest and next checks, last major assembly overhaul, and more. We’ve received strong feedback about the resulting savings and efficiency improvement.

In addition to the parking app, how is Airbus helping its customers during this period of parked aircraft—and their return to service? What have airlines been requesting?

Since the start of the mass grounding period, we immediately received requests for support on parking, storage, maintenance task holidays, cargo in the cabin, and even bird nest protection.

Among our first actions was to organize webinars with customers worldwide to help them through some of the basic parking and storage procedures, provide first work alleviation recommendations, and to take inputs and requests. We held more than 20 webinars; in each session, 100-150 customers were connected and their feedback was generally very positive.

How have you helped airlines adjust maintenance requirements, given the parked situation?

The second major effort, which is still ongoing, is to work on technical solutions for maintenance burden reduction. I can give three examples:

Recommendations for tasks with calendar intervals that become ‘due’ during the period of parking/storage. When an aircraft is grounded, some of these tasks can be postponed to the time of return to service. Solutions were found to grant further extensions of some calendar intervals until several months after return to service.

*Parking and storage tasks: Recommendations for tasks designed to preserve the value of the aircraft, maintain it in an airworthy condition, and facilitate its return to service. Some tasks, such as periodic engine runs, require special conditions and generate a high workload, especially when so many aircraft need to be maintained simultaneously. Again, solutions were found to reduce the related workload without compromising safety. For instance, on the basis of accumulated experience, the team could grant performing “Parking Periodic Ground Checks” only every 15 days, instead of every seven.

*Cargo in the Cabin: To address the sudden need to transport cargo in the aircraft cabin, we issued a number of technical recommendations and we held a dedicated webinar with our operators in late April. As we may see this desire remain, we are working on a long-term cargo in the cabin solution. (Note: the tech recommendations were OIT 999-0033/20 “Cargo Transportation in the cabin”; ISI 00.00.00370 “How to transport cargo in the aircraft cabin during COVID-19 outbreak? via FOT 999.0028/20)

How about training changes?

We are also active in the flight and maintenance training domain, where in addition to operating our training centers worldwide, we also enable remote learning solutions via virtual classroom instruction and a ‘relaunch program’ to help pilots prepare to restart after a period of grounding.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.905858039855957}",positive,0.905858039855957,1

Fear of Landing – Garuda Airbus A330 stuck in the mud - Fear of Landing,"Fri, 03 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmVhcm9mbGFuZGluZy5jb20vYWNjaWRlbnRzL2dhcnVkYS1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1zdHVjay1pbi10aGUtbXVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was some time ago when I managed to get the Piper Saratoga so bogged down in the mud that my aircraft had to be towed out by four strong men and a landrover. I was attempting a short cut, in a rush to depart, and thought that I could save time by cutting across a bit of grass rather than remain on the taxiway. I was wrong.

When I saw the news on Wednesday, I’m going to admit that it made me feel a little bit better that I’m not the only pilot who this has happened to.

At the Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport in Makassar, a Garuda Indonesia Airbus A330-300 scheduled for a one hour domestic passenger flight to Jakarta sank into the mud after a runway excursion off the side of the runway.

The Airbus was backtracking along the runway and attempted an 180° turn in order to position itself to line up for departure with 26 passengers on board. During the turn, the aircraft skidded off the runway

Garuda Indonesia A330 veers off the runway while preparing to depart from Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Indonesia. No injuries reported. https://t.co/CiLJpz3a55 pic.twitter.com/SSDepy3q59 — Breaking Aviation News & Videos (@breakingavnews) July 1, 2020

Aviation Herald reports that that the nose gear and the left main gear sunk into the mud with only the right main gear on the paved surface.

The Airbus Takeoff Safety Training Aid manual has a table for the Lineup Distance Charts for a 180° turnaround. For the A330-300, the minimum runway width required for a 180° turn while maintaining the minimum edge safety distance is 70 metres (230 feet).

Runway 03/21 at Makassar is 45 metres across; a standard width for an international airport but only half that of what the flight crew needed to make the turn safely. There are no “turnpads” on the runway although the connecting taxiway could be used to allow for a larger turning circle.

One commentor on AVHerald says that the A330 can turn without margin in a width of just 48 metres. The runway was still not wide enough and besides, on this occasion, it seems they really needed that margin.

The reason for the 180° can be seen in the NOTAMS for Makassar:

Q) WAAF/QMXLC/IV/M /A /000/999/0504S11933E A) WAAA

B) 20/04/20 05:26 C) 20/07/20 09:00

E) TWY WP BTN TWY G AND TWY H, AND TWY H CLSD DUE TO WIP RMK : HEAVY EQUIPMENT PRESENT

That is to say, there is a notice to airmen (NOTAM) that from the 20th of April to the 20th of July 2020 (B), a number of the taxiways (TWY) at Makassar (Aerodrome WAAA) are closed for work in progress (WIP) using heavy equipment.

Indonesia has been investing in upgrades at regional airports for the past decade or two, including repairing defective pavement and widening taxiways. AVHerald reports that they were turning for a departure on 03 while Indoflyer.net reports that the aircraft was backtracking and then turning for a departure on 21. The closed taxiways in the list above include both the taxiway for the threshold for 21 (TWY WP) and for the threshold of 03 (TWY H); however it seems to me that Indoflyer is correct based on the AVGS playback.

Gerry Soejatman, an aviation safety “pro & geek” based in Jakarta comes to the same conclusion, theorising that the Airbus A330 started the 180° turn too early, although he doesn’t appear to have read the NOTAM before posting so I don’t know how reliable this is.

Analysis of #GarudaIndonesia #GIA613 #PKGHD in #UPGairport this evening. Aircraft made the 180 turn too early, not giving itself enough space to make turn. Why he did that or why not go around the taxiways and enter from the other runway, is probably going to be investigated. pic.twitter.com/mN1v5I1DaW — Gerry Soejatman (@GerryS) July 1, 2020

Either way, the taxiways would allow for some extra turning space but, in line with our previous discussion, it is quite possible that those taxiways had collected grit and other debris through the construction and the general disuse of the airport as a part of quarantine measures, which could result in a lack of traction.

Simple Flying: Garuda Indonesia A330 Gets Stuck In The Mud At Makassar

PK-GHD has kept flying in recent months but on reduced schedules. Before yesterday’s flights, the aircraft flew up to Seoul from Jakarta on Saturday, June 27, returning to Jakarta on Monday, June 30. Then it sat idle for 48 hours.

Of course, a new NOTAM came into play immediately:

A1460/20 NOTAMN

Q) WAAF/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/0504S11933E005

A) WAAA B) 2007011220 C) 2007011600

E) RWY 03/21 CLSD DUE TO BLOCK ACFT

Translation: Runway 03/21 closed as it is blocked by an aircraft. The flight was cancelled and as of yesterday, the aircraft was still at Makassar.

The Airbus A330 was towed out of the mud that night. I presume it required a bit more than a Landrover to get it out.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994909763336182}",neutral,0.9994909763336182,0

The aircraft - which is part of the order of 50 from the Airbus A320 Family signed in 2018 - arrived in Delhi this morning from Airbus’ production facility in Hamburg, Germany. This addition makes Vistara the first airline in South Asia to offer lie-flat beds on a narrowbody aircraft and one of the few such airlines across the world. Vistara today also revealed the new cabin products for its A321neo aircraft, which includes world-class cabin interiors and features.

Mr. Leslie Thng, Chief Executive Officer, Vistara said, “This new addition to our fleet reinforces our long-term commitment to international expansion plans, despite the challenges of the current times. The new cabin products on our A321neo aircraft truly complement our promise of providing a premium and world-class flying experience to travellers from and to India.”

“The A321neo aircraft ensures operational enhancement, cost effectiveness as well as reduction of carbon footprint for us while enabling extra payload capacity, greater fuel efficiency and higher range. All of these aspects perfectly align with our international growth strategy”, added Mr. Thng.

Featuring Vistara’s three-class cabin configuration, the aircraft has a total of 188 seats – 12 in Business Class , 24 in Premium Economy and 152 in Economy. All of them feature 4-way adjustable headrests and movable armrests. Vistara customers will enjoy seat-back entertainment and in-seat power/USB Charging Ports in every seat. The airline’s state-of-the-art In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system features a content-rich multimedia library that total up to 700 hours of content, a superior map experience with 3D flight path map and flight tracker. The aircraft is also equipped with wireless connectivity, which will allow passengers to access the internet through onboard Wi-Fi, 3G mobile data through GSM and GPRS for SMS and MMS services, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.

The A321neo aircraft are at least 20% more fuel efficient per seat than the previous generation aircraft with the new technology engines and new aerodynamics of the wings (sharklets). The aircraft also boasts an increased operating range due to an additional Centre Tank installed in the Aft Cargo compartment, which increases fuel capacity by 2300 kgs. Additionally, the Airbus Cabin Flex configuration on the A321neo also ensures optimum utilisation of space without compromising on cabin comfort. The powerful, in-built air filtration systems on this aircraft ensure elimination of viruses and bacteria to refresh the cabin air every 2-3 minutes.

“In these challenging times, differentiation through efficiency, product and customer mindset is what truly matters, and we are proud to see our A321neo as an essential cornerstone in meeting Vistara’s strategic objectives for the future, “says Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus. “Providing a competitive edge through India’s best in class business cabin as well as significant advantages in terms of operations, efficiency and environment are a truly wise way for a growing airline going forward.”

The Airbus A321neo aircraft are intended for use on short to medium-haul international routes or destinations within seven hours of flying time. In March 2020, the airline inducted its first widebody aircraft, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, for long-haul international operations. Vistara is India’s highest-rated airline on Skytrax and TripAdvisor and has been the winner of several ‘Best Airline’ awards.

German Bundeswehr renews Service Contracts for Heron 1 systems in Afghanistan and Mali - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wNy1nZXJtYW4tYnVuZGVzd2Voci1yZW5ld3Mtc2VydmljZS1jb250cmFjdHMtZm9yLWhlcm9uLTEtc3lzdGVtcy1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Covers all operational services of Heron 1 systems



Service Contract is renewed until entry-into-service of Heron TP

Bremen, 09 July 2020 – Airbus Defence and Space and the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) have signed a renewed service contract agreement for Heron 1 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in operation in Afghanistan and Mali.

In Afghanistan, Heron 1 Services has been extended in March 2020, for the period June 2020 / May 2021. It had successfully logged up more than 46,000 flight hours in over 4,100 operational flights. Also in March this year, the German Air Force passed the milestone of 10 years of Heron 1 operations in Afghanistan, with a first operational flight dating back to 17th March 2010.

Comparably in Mali, Heron 1 services has also been extended for the period August 2020 / July 2021 (with an option for August 2021 / July 2022). It had logged more than 11,500 flight hours in over 1200 operational flights. The system’s first flight in Mali dates back to 1st November 2016 after the first service contract was signed in July 2016.

When adding the Heron 1’s operations for the German Armed Forces in both Afghanistan and Mali, the Air Force’s UAV system has thus chalked up more than 57,500 successful operational flight hours.

Both places of deployment are being managed using a joint operator model between the Bundeswehr and industry. The Heron 1’s provision, maintenance and repair of the system is the responsibility of Airbus Defence and Space in Bremen.

This operator model impressively demonstrated its performance capabilities during operations in Afghanistan and Mali, as emphasised by proven high system readiness of 99%. The deployments of the Heron system in Afghanistan and Mali also help develop expertise within the Bundeswehr with a view to future MALE RPAS systems.

German reconnaissance tasks focus on the country’s crisis regions in order to provide the best possible protection for the country’s population as well as for the German troops and the contingents of other mission nations stationed in the country.

Manufactured by the Israeli company IAI (Israel Aerospace Industries), Heron 1 is an unarmed medium altitude long endurance (MALE) UAS which can stay airborne above the respective theatre of operations.

The Heron 1 has a wingspan of 16.6 meters and a maximum mission endurance of over 24 hours. The system’s military tasks include detecting booby traps from the air, accompanying convoys and patrols, assisting forces in combat situations, reconnoitring and surveilling routes, establishing movement profiles and long-term monitoring, supporting situation assessments, and protecting property and military camps. It is also used to support humanitarian missions.



These Heron 1 systems, currently deployed by the German Armed Forces in Afghanistan and Mali, are to be replaced by the more powerful IAI Heron TP, following an operator agreement signed in Berlin in July 2018 between Airbus Defence and Space and the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw). The replacement of Heron 1 by Heron TP will have a two-year set-up phase, followed by an operational phase lasting a further seven years, thereby bridging the gap until a sovereign European MALE UAS will be developed.

Optus orders OneSat satellite from Airbus - SpaceNews,"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9vcHR1cy1vcmRlcnMtb25lc2F0LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus Defence and Space on July 2 announced that it will build a geostationary communications satellite for Optus that will provide coverage over Australia and the surrounding region.

Airbus will build the satellite, called Optus-11, on its new OneSat platform, designed with a reconfigurable payload that can steer and reassign beams for different customers and services.

Optus-11 is projected to launch in 2023, though a launch provider has not been announced, and will expand Optus’ fleet to six geostationary satellites. Optus plans to locate the satellite at the 160 degrees East orbital slot for coverage over Australia, New Zealand and part of Antarctica. The satellite’s coverage will also extend west to the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean, and east to a “vast majority of the Pacific region.”

“Optus 11 will add capacity and resilience to our satellite fleet and its unique capabilities will give our broadcast customers the option to tailor their dynamic video delivery via IP streaming, and our broadband customers can benefit from better performance and higher individual throughputs,” Ben White, Optus managing director of wholesale, satellite and strategy, said in a statement.

The satellite will also support Optus’ cellular network by backhauling data, and the Australian government’s Mobile Black Spot Program, a 380 million Australian dollar ($263 million) effort to fund telecommunications infrastructure in Australia.

Optus-11 will be an all Ku-band very high throughput satellite, according to Airbus. In an interview, Francois Gaullier, head of telecommunications satellites at Airbus, said the satellite will weigh approximately 3,000 kilograms and feature an all-electric propulsion system.

Optus is Airbus’ second customer for OneSat, following Inmarsat’s three-satellite order in 2019. The manufacturer designed OneSat with help from the European, French and British space agencies, as a smaller geostationary satellite that can eventually be built in 18 months. Gaullier said Airbus hopes to reach that time frame in 2022.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.606079638004303}",neutral,0.606079638004303,0
Aeroflot airline to reinvent its fleet with Airbus' new generation aircraft only - www.rusaviainsider.com,"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c2F2aWFpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hZXJvZmxvdC1haXJsaW5lLXRvLXJlaW52ZW50LWl0cy1mbGVldC13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1uZXctZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1haXJjcmFmdC1vbmx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An airline industry source close to Aeroflot Group has revealed more details on the revolutionary programme, which slated to place the Russian flag carrier among the world’s top Five-Star airlines. According to this insider information, by 2028 Aeroflot would operate Airbus-only fleet of 175 aircraft, with Airbus A350 as core of its long-haul operations.

The airline’s fleet plan is part of the Aeroflot Group’s new ambitious strategy for the period up to 2028 that was presented to Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin by the group’s general director Vitaly Saveliev and approved by the group’s Board of Directors on July 16.

The state-run group, which combines the title carrier Aeroflot with subsidiaries Rossiya Airlines, low-cost carrier (LCC) Pobeda Airlines, targets 130 million passengers annually by 2028, while operating a fleet of 600 jets. The strategy also calls for further differentiation among the group’s airlines in terms of their individual priorities and operating models. As a result Aeroflot would reemerge as a world-class premium carrier with predominantly international operations.

The details of the strategy, which were not then revealed to the public, include the plan to “gradually unify” Aeroflot’s fleet, which by 2028 would consist of Airbus-only aircraft. According to a source 81 Airbus A350s, a mix of -900 and bigger -1000, would serve the airline’s long-haul operations, whilst its medium-haul segment would rely on 94 of Airbus’ re-engined A320neo family aircraft, including 75 A321neo and 19 A320neo.

Aeroflot currently operates 19 Boeing 777-300ERs, 18 Airbus A330s, one A350-900, 47 B737-800s, 74 A320s, 33 A321s and 54 Superjet 100s. To make way for its would-be new generation all-Airbus fleet, the airline plans to phase-out all of its A330s and A320/A321ceos. All B737s will be transferred to LCC Pobeda, while Boeing 777s and Superjet 100s will be moved to Rossiya Airlines.

The traffic target (which will be essentially international one) for Aeroflot airline, without its sister carriers Pobeda and Rossiya counted, is to reach between 35 and 40 million passengers per year by 2028. This is roughly level with the airline’s 2019 total traffic results of 37.2 million passengers, but only 52 per cent of these passengers were served on international routes.

Such significant international traffic increase can be achieved not so much by meeting the needs of Russians travelling abroad, but primarily by the transit of passengers from Southeast Asia to Europe and America, via its Moscow’s Sheremetyevo hub and possibly would-be Siberian regional hub in Krasnoyarsk.

It is safe to assume that the airline will need its fleet of medium-haul Airbus A320neo family aircraft to provide flights in the European and Mediterranean regions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",neutral,0.9999988079071045,0

As a result of the current health crisis, many government and private helicopter operators in Latin America have found themselves on the front lines of pandemic and are playing an essential role in supporting their countries’ efforts to fight the virus. Many operators are providing emergency medical transportation for critically ill patients, while others are supporting health authorities with the transport of tests and medical personnel. There are also those who have been instrumental in distributing food and medicine to vulnerable and isolated communities. What all of them have in common is their unfaltering commitment to supporting their fellow citizens during a difficult and challenging period.

Adapting to the demands of the crisis

Coordenação de Operações Aéreas (COA)

The daily routine of the Coordenação de Operações Aéreas (COA) in Rio de Janeiro has been hugely impacted by the crisis. Prior to the outbreak, COA operations usually involved the transport of the governor and his/her close collaborators. With the arrival of the pandemic, the team now supports the State Military Fire Department to carry out inter-hospital transport of Covid-19 patients with their H135 helicopter.

“The procedures before and after flight have drastically changed with the crisis”, explains Lieutenant Colonel Marcelo de Carvalho Mendes. “A briefing with the medical teams has become essential to prepare the flight and we also need to put a lot of attention to carefully removing our protective equipment once the flight is over. We have also developed new protocols to disinfect the aircraft in order to eliminate the risk of contamination.”

“The procedures before and after flight have drastically changed with the crisis,” explains Lieutenant Colonel Marcelo de Carvalho Mendes.

To isolate the patient inside the H135 cabin, the COA uses a stretcher with protective cover which efficiently protects the crew and medical team. The device also reduces the time needed for disinfecting the aircraft between the missions.

“The biggest challenge for the crew is keeping emotionally strong as this is a new disease with still many unknowns,” adds Carvalho. “However, we have quickly adapted to wearing personal safety equipment, which include waterproof clothing, gloves, masks and glasses – and with this protective gear, the operations are conducted smoothly.”

About 1200 km south of Río de Janeiro, in the Brazilian State of Paraná, the Batalhão de Polícia Militar de Operações Aéreas do Paraná (BPMOA) has also adopted new protocols to protect the crews aboard their fleet of H130s, locally known as Falcões.

The BPMOA’s daily operations include a large variety of missions such as medical evacuation, search and rescue, law enforcement and firefighting. However, in the last few months their entire helicopter fleet has been assigned to support the State Health Department with the transport Covid-19 tests and H1N1 vaccines to the 399 municipalities of the state, which covers 199.299 km2.

Covering such a large territory with the urgency imposed by the crisis has been a challenge for the crew, which has also needed to adapt the aircraft’s cabin to cope with the new missions.

“Before every mission we need to remove all the seats, except for those belonging to the two pilots, and quickly reorganize the cabin to fit the big boxes containing the tests, etc.,” says Julio Cesar Pucci dos Santos, BPMOA Chief Commander. “The helicopter’s spacious cabin and the possibility to quickly change its configuration from passenger to cargo transport is a great advantage.”

In Chile, the Naval Aviation is participating in the country’s efforts to fight COVID-19 with their Super Puma AS332L, Dauphin AS365 and the BO105 fleets. In the wake of the health crisis, they have expanded their operations, mainly dedicated to search and rescue and medical evacuation missions, to also include patrol flights and the transport of medical personnel and equipment. “The aim of the patrol flights is to verify quarantine compliance and assure the sanitary cordon is being respected,” says Captain Francisco Uribe, Head of Communication of the Naval Aviation”. “We are also supporting the health authorities with the transport of medical specialists to some of the country’s most remote areas.”

Earlier in April, the AS365 helicopter crew transported two medical workers from the southernmost region of Magallanes to Puerto Edén, one of Chile’s most isolated and inhabited villages in the Wellington Island near Antarctica, in order to test the population and isolate any potential cases.

In early July, it was the Navy’s BO105 turn to fly to the the world’s southernmost town, Puerto Williams, in Chile's Antarctic region to provide the local population with medical check-ups and guidelines for protecting themselves against COVID-19.

Inter-hospital (IHT) patient transfer

As in many other countries, the Chilean health authorities strive to avoid the oversaturation of hospitals in high density metropolitan areas such as Santiago. As a result, and the air support division of Carabineros de Chile, the Chilean police, has been very actively performing inter-hospital transfers with their EC135 helicopters. “The use of a helicopter for such transfers reduces the transport time by more than half, and time is crucial when transporting critically ill patients to the hospital,” says Colonel Belisario Vega Hermosilla, head of the Prefectura Aérea.

The first of such missions took place in May, when Carabineros were called to transfer one patient from the Luis Tisné hospital in the capital Santiago to a hospital in the town of Talca, in the region of Maule. “There are about 256 km between these two hospitals and the transport by road would have taken almost three hours. With the helicopter we managed to get the patient in Talca in only one hour,” adds Vega Hermosilla.

To perform these delicate operations, Carabineros have trained their helicopter teams to integrate patient isolation devices (PID), which are an effective way to contain the patient environment and thus to reduce the risk of contamination. Very strict protocols have also been introduced to preserve the health of the crew and the passengers, such as complete personal protective equipment (PPE) and reinforced cabin decontamination.

Commercial helicopter operators join humanitarian efforts

The health crisis has also seriously affected the business of many commercial helicopter operators. Some of them, like Ecocopter Ecuador and Rent A’ Kopter in Panama, have adapted themselves to the situation and reoriented their activity towards supporting solidarity projects in their respective countries.

Ecocopter Ecuador has collaborated with Quito based Cecilia Rivadeneira Foundation to transport food, thermometers, masks and other personal protective equipment to vulnerable communities in the isolated Anedean towns of Ambato and other towns in the north of the country. “After one year of operations in Ecuador, it is important for our company to participate in humanitarian actions in support of the local communities,"" says Gustavo Junovich, CEO of Ecocopter Ecuador. “These are difficult times for all of us and we will only overcome this crisis by helping each other,” he adds.

Based in Panama City, Rent A’ Kopter’s main operation is the transport of passengers for business or leisure, but the restrictive measures put in place by the authorities to stop the spread of the virus have put their activities in hold. In light of the current conditions, the company has put their H125 and H130 helicopters at the disposal of the Panamanian government and has actively participated in the “Plan Panamá Solidario”, in support of the country’s most disadvantaged communities.

“We have been flying to difficult access areas in the provinces of Chiriquí, Colón and Darién to distribute food and essential goods to the population,” says Operations Chief, Jack Betesh.

“We have flown more than 80 hours and traversed the country to reach villages 400 km away from our base. Our team is extremely committed to help the most vulnerable in these difficult times and despite the distance, we feel that we are ‘transporting hope’ to those in need.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9894281029701233}",neutral,0.9894281029701233,0

Teijin Limited says that its Tenax dry reinforcements (DR) carbon fiber material is now qualified to produce Airbus A320neo wing spoilers using resin transfer molding (RTM).

The automated RTM process can now incorporate Tenax dry reinforcements non-crimp fabrics (DRNF) and dry reinforcements braided fibers (DRBF) to form skins and stiffeners while maintaining existing product interfaces, so that final spoiler components can be directly replaced, the company said.

Teijin says that its Tenax DRNF materials are made of bundled carbon fiber filaments spread out in one direction in multiple layers with different directions, depending on the final component`s structural requirements, while Tenax DRBF can be applied within the spoiler component structure to act as cavity fillers. Both materials have been qualified individually by Airbus specifically for this application.

The combination of the Tenax DRNF and Tenax DRBF achieve the Spirit AeroSystems criteria for aircraft component production such as effective process ability, productivity, and cost efficiency. A320neo spoiler components will be manufactured within a new high-volume production facility in Spirit AeroSystems, Prestwick, Scotland.

The company is expecting FAA certification to follow shortly prior to first delivery to an undisclosed US customer later this year.

“The successful completion of the H160 Type Certificate is the result of several years of tremendous work and efforts accomplished jointly by the involved technical teams of the Agency and Airbus Helicopters in a remarkable fruitful cooperation spirit,” EASA Certification Director Rachel Daeschler said. “It is the result of thorough design and testing efforts, to ensure the highest safety standards are reached. The design of the H160 makes it suitable for a wide range of versatile missions. It is also one of the most environmentally friendly with respect to fuel consumption and one of the quietest helicopters of its class.

My personal appreciation and warmest congratulations are conveyed to the involved technical staff who continuously showed high commitment for constructive collaboration to overcome the challenges inherent to this type certification project,” she added.

“We are proud that the H160 has received its EASA type certificate. This achievement represents years of hard work designing, industrializing and defining the support ecosystem with our suppliers and partners and I would like to thank everyone who has dedicated their time and energy to turning this next generation helicopter into reality,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “I now look forward to the H160 entering into service and offering its innovative features that bring competitiveness alongside additional comfort and safety to customers worldwide,” he added.

Airbus Helicopters relied on three prototypes, the first serial aircraft, and two additional test means, the dynamic helicopter zero and the system helicopter zero, to develop and certify the aircraft and continues to mature the aircraft ahead of entry into service. The helicopters have flown over 1500 hours both for flight tests and demo flights so that customers can experience first-hand the innovation and added value the H160 will bring to their missions.

Designed as a multi-role helicopter able to perform a wide range of missions such as offshore transportation, emergency medical services, private and business aviation, and public services, the H160 integrates Airbus Helicopters’ latest technological innovations. These include breakthrough safety features with Helionix’s accrued pilot assistance and automated features as well as flight envelop protection. The helicopter also provides passengers with superior comfort thanks to the sound-reducing Blue Edge blades and superb external visibility that benefits both passengers and pilots.

H160 was not just designed with passengers and pilots in mind. Operators will appreciate its competiveness thanks to its increased fuel efficiency and customer-centric simplified maintenance eco-system: equipment accessibility has been facilitated by the helicopter’s optimised architecture, the maintenance plan was thoroughly verified during the Operator Zero campaigns, and it is delivered with intuitive 3D maintenance documentation.

Airbus: A350-loans now comply with WTO ruling | - AirInsight,"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbG9hbnMtbm93LWNvbXBseS13aXRoLXd0by1ydWxpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Airbus has amended its contracts with France and Spain on loans it has received for launching and developing the A350, the airframer announced on July 24. With these amendments, Airbus claims to have fully complied with the requirements set out in the May 2018 ruling from the World Trade Organization (WTO) on illegal subsidies and state aid.

Europe (Airbus) and the US (Boeing) have fought long and hard battles on state aid for large commercial aircraft programs since 2004. The US has claimed that over the years Airbus has received EUR 19.4 billion in illegal subsidies to develop its family of aircraft, in particular the A380. It later included the A350.

The US and Boeing say that Airbus has hugely benefitted from the subsidies by winning some $200 billion in aircraft orders that were detrimental to in particular Boeing’s 787. Those subsidies were seen as a “genuine and substantial” cause of the current market presence of the A350.

According to the US, between 2016 and 2018 the A350 won orders for 144 aircraft from Sichuan Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, Philippine Airlines, Turkish Airlines, StarLux, and Emirates were Airbus has had an advantage over Boeing because of state subsidies.

Another airline to benefit from this has been Virgin Atlantic with its order for twelve A350-1000s in 2016. The airline was offered delivery slots much earlier than what was realistically possible (2019 versus 2022), a WTO-report said in 2019.

Subsidies as such not illegal, certain terms are

In May 2018, the WTO upheld a ruling from 2016 which said that the US had failed to demonstrate that launch aid subsidies from France, Spain, Germany, and the UK for the A380 and A350XWB were prohibited export and/or import substitution subsidies of domestically produced parts under the agreement on Subsidies on Countervailing Measures (SCM). As such, the so-called repayable launch investment (RLI) loans were deemed not to be illegal but their terms contain certain conditions that contravene with the SCM-agreement.

Following the WTO ruling, the Trump administration through the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on October 18, 2019, imposed a 10-percent import tariff on all European-built Airbus aircraft. With a list price in 2018 for the A350-900 of $317 million and the -1000 of $366.5 million, you can calculate the effect.

German and UK agreements amended before

In the December 2019 WTO report, the EU said that Airbus had already amended the German and UK launch aid and member state financing (MSF) agreements for the A350 to such an extent that they were consistent “with a contemporaneous market benchmark, such that the subsidy conferred by German A350XWB MSF is withdrawn.” This was questioned by the US, which claims the amendments actually “made Airbus better off financially than it otherwise would have been.”

In the case of the UK agreement, the EU stated that Airbus had repaid the full outstanding principal and interest accrued under the UK A350XWB loan contract, such that the subsidy conferred by the UK agreement had been withdrawn. At the same time, there has been a “passive amortization of benefit of the Spanish A380 launch aid and MSF subsidy” while the French agreement now included a reduced draw-down in loans in order to comply with the SCM Agreement.

Despite these amendments, the WTO concluded that the EU still had failed to comply with recommendations made back in 2016. “We, therefore, find that the aggregated “indirect” effects of A380 launch aid/MSF subsidies and “direct” effects of A350XWB LA/MSF subsidies are a “genuine and substantial” cause of present lost sales to the US LCA industry in the global twin-aisle product market.”

No stone left unturned

Today, Airbus says it has amended the terms of the RLI contracts with France and Spain by paying a higher interest rate on the loans, which are paid back with each A350 that is delivered. “We have fully complied with all the WTO requirements. These additional amendments to the A350 RLIs demonstrate that Airbus has left no stone unturned to find a way towards a solution,” CEO Guillaume Faury says in a media statement. “This is a clear signal of support to those who are suffering from the severe impact of the tariffs imposed by the USTR, especially at a time when industries are hard hit by the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis.”

It remains to be seen if the US is convinced and satisfied by the latest announcement from Airbus. The battle over large commercial aircraft subsidies is far from over as the jury is still out on a ruling on US subsidies to Boeing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983463287353516}",neutral,0.9983463287353516,0

Selecting the right equipment is vital to success in the North Sea and according to oil and gas customer NHV, the H175 has proven its worth carrying passengers and crew safely where they need to go.

NHV, the fleet leader

“Customers want an aircraft that’s always ready to fly,” explains Jamie John, Base Manager for NHV in Aberdeen. “They want it to deliver on time, be comfortable, quiet and offer a different solution to the norm. We can see that the H175 is producing on all these fronts, allowing customers to have peace of mind and know that their passengers and staff will get where they are going safely, efficiently and on time.”

The NHV Group was the inaugural customer of the H175 with the first two aircraft entering service in December 2014. They now operate 13 H175s from their Aberdeen (Scotland) and Esbjerg (Denmark) bases. Choosing the H175 enables the company to cover 90 percent of its North Sea offshore installations with a full payload.

“It’s great for offshore,” says pilot Tom Willis, NHV. “We can do the job of the super heavy fleet now. It’s a very stable, fast and quiet machine…and it’s great that the passengers are able to see out.""

Today, NHV is the H175 fleet leader with a recent 40,000 flight hour milestone. In 2019, the company was awarded another long-term contract with Petrofac to cover four crew change flights per week and will depart from NHV’s base in Aberdeen using the H175.

“It’s perfect for pilots” claims Eric Verhoogt, engineer at NHV. “It flies really well, just like a fixed wing. Accessibility is also better than for a lot of older aircraft. It’s a very nice aircraft to work on as an engineer.”

Much appreciated safety features

“It’s an absolute pleasure to see the crews coming out of the H175 because they’re just grinning from ear to ear,” says Regional Maintenance Manager/Deputy Operations Manager, Lee James, CHC Helicopter. “They love to fly it because of its automation, because of its capabilities.” CHC Helicopter’s fleet of four H175s, which recently celebrated 5,000 flight hours, service offshore oil and gas operations in the North Sea. Their last H175 was the first Airbus helicopter to be delivered with digital logcards, a document that tracks the entire history of critical helicopter parts, from manufacture to the end of their in-service lives. The Helionix advanced avionics suite of the H175 is one of the safety features most appreciated by crews. It offers unrivalled pilot assistance in an intuitive human-machine interface, improving overall safety through reduced pilot workload. “The difference is the superior interface with the Helionix and Airbus autopilot,” explains Captain Maxine Ackerley, CHC Helicopter. “You can find anything you need at a glance.”

CHC Helicopters will use digital logcards with its H175.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7657493948936462}",positive,0.7657493948936462,1

Airbus and Boeing sold just one plane in June - EURACTIV,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFjdGl2LmNvbS9zZWN0aW9uL2Flcm9zcGFjZS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLXNvbGQtanVzdC1vbmUtcGxhbmUtaW4tanVuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global aerospace duopoly of Airbus and Boeing managed to sell just one aircraft in June, as the virus outbreak’s economic impact on the aviation industry and the grounded MAX scandal continue to affect order books.

According to sales figures released this month by pan-European conglomerate Airbus and US firm Boeing, just one new aircraft was ordered in June and it was not even a passenger plane. Delivery giant FedEx bought a cargo aircraft from Boeing.

Coronavirus has had a significant impact on the aviation industry, prompting airlines to massively scale back any plans they had for expansion in the coming years, as the sector does not expect air traffic to reach pre-crisis levels for some time.

Airbus, which was preparing to ramp up production after registering a large number of orders in 2019, did not log a single sale in June but did manage to keep delivering planes to existing clients.

The firm said in a statement that it “delivered 36 commercial aircraft in June 2020, compared to 24 in May and 14 in April, bringing the total for the first half of the year to 196 deliveries. This compares to 389 deliveries in H1 2019. The decrease reflects the COVID-19 crisis.”

Coronavirus grounds Airbus and Boeing’s lofty plans Developments in the aerospace industry are falling by the wayside because of the coronavirus outbreak’s huge impact on the sector: US planemaker Boeing has abandoned international joint venture plans while European rival Airbus has nixed a project aimed at producing electric-powered aircraft.

MAX’d out

Thirty-one of Airbus’ June deliveries were of its A320neo, a direct competitor to Boeing’s 737 MAX, which is still grounded pending recertification by aviation regulators, following two deadly crashes in recent years.

The pandemic has compounded the effects of the MAX affair, which already threatened to disrupt Boeing’s commercial business, as clients and passengers both started to lose faith in the planemaker’s safety record.

Indeed, despite winning June 1-0 against Airbus, the US firm also saw 60 orders for MAX aircraft cancelled and was forced to remove a further 123 planes from its order books as doubts over its capacity to deliver finally told.

Boeing has only registered 59 sales – plus 323 cancellations – in total this year, while Airbus logged 298 orders.

Boeing CFO Greg Smith said its defence and space contracts “will continue to provide some stability as we navigate through the pandemic and rebuild stronger on the other side” but the firm is still reliant on the MAX returning to service.

The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), started test flights on the grounded plane last week as part of its in-depth recertification process. FAA approval is required before the aircraft can resume flying in US airspace.

Even the blessing of the FAA will not be the end of the saga though, as its European counterpart – EASA – is insistent on performing its own test flights before granting the green light for the MAX to operate on this side of the Atlantic.

However, virus travel restrictions mean there “is no firm timetable”, according to an EASA spokesperson, who told EURACTIV that the agency’s experts need to be able to rely on transatlantic travel to even start the process.

Boeing crash could be ‘scandal to rival Dieselgate’, say MEPs The European Parliament’s transport committee quizzed the head of the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on Monday (18 March) about the ongoing investigation into a crash that prompted agencies around the world to ground Boeing MAX aircraft.

Airbus and Boeing are the subject of a bitter trade spat between Brussels and Washington, as part of a World Trade Organisation dispute over subsidies and the implementation of tariffs on other goods.

Last week, the EU said it would “act decisively” if the US follows through on its threat to slap charges on imports such as beer, gin and automobiles.

The WTO ruled last year that the EU continues to provide unfair subsidies to Airbus. Later this year, it will rule on whether the US was also guilty of propping up Boeing unfairly with grants and subsidies.

Airbus impairs inventories 'at risk' as stored aircraft level rises - Flightglobal,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyLXRyYW5zcG9ydC9haXJidXMtaW1wYWlycy1pbnZlbnRvcmllcy1hdC1yaXNrLWFzLXN0b3JlZC1haXJjcmFmdC1sZXZlbC1yaXNlcy8xMzk1NDkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has recorded a near-€300 million charge for impairment of inventories considered at risk, as stored aircraft continue to push up its inventory level.

The airframer reveals in its first-half accounts to 30 June that its inventories stood at €37.5 billion – up by nearly €6 billion on the figure at the end of 2019.

It had already risen by €4.4 billion in the first quarter, with more than €3.9 billion of this figure attributed to an increase in finished aircraft and work in progress, as customers requested deferral of deliveries.

No significant impairment was recorded in the first quarter.

But Airbus says the deferrals and rising numbers of stored aircraft – some 145 remained undelivered by the end of June – have contributed €5.2 billion to inventories over the first half.

Airbus has carried out a “comprehensive review” of operational assets and liabilities, it says, taking into account amended production rates and expected future deliveries.

This review has resulted in first-half charges of €1.2 billion, including a €299 million impairment of inventories “considered at risk”.

The charges also cover €276 million in provisions relating to the A380 programme, following the decision last year to discontinue production of the double-deck jet.

Airbus adds that further charges of €400 million provide for supplier commitments and other commercial risks.

Although the airframer is not giving a forecast on undelivered aircraft by the end of the year, chief executive Guillaume Faury says the figure of 145 “should be the high point”. The company’s objective is to “converge” production and deliveries during the third quarter, he says, and reduce stored aircraft levels.

“We intend to improve moving forward,” he adds.

Airbus says the coronavirus crisis has resulted in “significant disruption” to its operations and supply chain, after the commercial aircraft market and aerospace industry in general were “severely impacted”.

But Airbus stresses that, as a result of measures to reinforce its finances and balance sheet, it has available liquidity to cope with additional cash requirements including its amended commercial aircraft production rates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9071270227432251}",neutral,0.9071270227432251,0
ANA opens ticket sale for its Airbus A380 test flight - AeroTime,"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU0NzUtYW5hLW9wZW5zLXRpY2tldC1zYWxlLWZvci1pdHMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI1NDc1LWFuYS1vcGVucy10aWNrZXQtc2FsZS1mb3ItaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXRlc3QtZmxpZ2h0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All Nippon Airways is opening its Airbus A380 test flight for the public. ANA will lift the “Flying Honu” superjumbo for a 90-minute soar from Narita to Narita on August 22, 2020.

ANA said it was organizing the charter flight NH2030 in response to customers’ voice, particularly for the people who wanted to experience a sightseeing flight on an Airbus A380, as outlined in the company’s press release on July 22, 2020.

For a $467 to $130 (50,000 yen to 14,000 yen) fee, passengers could get a “feeling of Hawaii” as the flight would be accompanied by various perks such, including souvenirs and presents for passengers wearing Hawaiian (HA) clothes (i.e. Aloha shirts).

Yet the yearning for Hawaii is not the only reason, which motivates ANA to lift the double decker for a spin.

The Japanese carrier uses its two A380s exclusively for flights to Hawaii. Following the coronavirus outbreak, the airline suspended the route on March 25, 2020, grounding the superjumbo. To keep the grounded aircraft in airworthy condition, the airline still has to ensure both ground maintenance work and a test flight within a certain period of time. It is one of such test flights that ANA is now selling tickets to, killing two birds with one stone.

ANA has not specified which of its two A380s would be used for the task. The airline currently has the delivery of a third, and final, A380 pending. Previously, the handing over was planned in April 2020, as the airliner was due to begin service on the planned Hawaii route from June 2020. Due to the crisis, the delivery was postponed for, reportedly, about half a year, meaning that the third Flying Honu is unlikely to enter service in time for the flight.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995997548103333}",neutral,0.9995997548103333,0
