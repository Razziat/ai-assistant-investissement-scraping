Viva Aerobus signs MoU for 90 A321neo - Airbus,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNy12aXZhLWFlcm9idXMtc2lnbnMtbW91LWZvci05MC1hMzIxbmVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mexico City, 05 July 2023 – Mexican ultra-low-cost airline Viva Aerobus has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for 90 A321neo aircraft to drive its international and domestic growth. This MoU would bring the airline's order book to 170 A320 Family aircraft.

“These 90 A321neo 240-seater aircraft will allow us to grow and renew our fleet and remain the youngest in Latin America. The technology and operational efficiency of the A321neos will improve our operational reliability, on-time performance, and provide an unmatched passenger experience. Additionally, we expect to drive further cost-savings which will reflect in lower airfares and strengthen one of our most important advantages: having the lowest cost in the Americas. The fuel-efficiency and noise reduction that the A321neo provides will advance our sustainability efforts by delivering immediate, tangible carbon emission reductions, thus enhancing our position as the most efficient airline in the continent,” said Juan Carlos Zuazua, Chief Executive Officer of Viva Aerobus.

“The Mexican leisure market is in full recovery mode and Viva Aerobus is at the centre of the action! The unbeatable economics of the A321neo make it the perfect choice for the airline's ultra-low cost model. We are pleased to have been a partner with the airline since 2013 and look forward to working together as it continues on its growth trajectory"", said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ A320neo Family, offering unparalleled range and performance. By incorporating new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50 percent noise reduction and more than 20 percent fuel savings compared to previous single-aisle generation aircraft, while maximizing passenger comfort with the widest single-aisle cabin and large overhead stowage space.

Viva Aerobus has based its fleet renewal strategy on the A320 Family. In 2013, the airline placed an order for 52 A320 Family aircraft, the largest Airbus aircraft order placed by a single airline in Mexico at the time. In 2018, Viva Aerobus ordered 25 A321neo aircraft. To date, Viva Aerobus operates 74 A320 Family aircraft.

Airbus has sold over 1,150 aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 750 are in operation throughout the region, with another 500 in the order backlog, representing a market share of nearly 60% of in-service passenger aircraft. Since 1994, Airbus has secured 75% of net orders in the region.

Revenues € 27.7 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 2.6 billion

EBIT (reported) € 1.9 billion; EPS (reported) € 1.94

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 1.6 billion

Guidance maintained

Amsterdam, 26 July 2023 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the Half-Year (H1) ended 30 June 2023.

“During the first half of 2023 we progressed well across our businesses in an operational environment that remains complex. Our commercial aircraft are in strong demand, as demonstrated by more than 800 orders announced at the Paris Air Show. This demand is driven both by growth and fleet replacement as airlines invest in more fuel efficient fleets,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “Based on this H1 performance, we maintain our 2023 guidance.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 1,080 (H1 2022: 442 aircraft) with net orders of 1,044 aircraft after cancellations (H1 2022: 259 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to a record 7,967 commercial aircraft at the end of June 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 131 net orders (H1 2022: 163 units) which were well spread across programmes and included 19 H160s. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 6.0 billion (H1 2022: € 6.5 billion), including 4 new-build and 5 converted A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft for Canada.

Consolidated revenues increased 11 percent year-on-year to € 27.7 billion (H1 2022: € 24.8 billion). A total of 316 commercial aircraft were delivered (H1 2022: 297(1)(2) aircraft), comprising 25 A220s, 256 A320 Family, 14 A330s and 21 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 16 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries increased to 145 units (H1 2022: 115 units), mainly driven by the Light helicopter segment. The Division’s revenues rose 16 percent, mainly reflecting a solid performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 8 percent, mainly driven by delays in Space Systems and delivery phasing in Military Air Systems. Three A400M military airlifters were delivered in H1 2023.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 2,618 million (H1 2022: € 2,645 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities was broadly stable at € 2,256 million (H1 2022: € 2,276 million). The positive effect from the increase in deliveries, supported by a more favourable hedge rate, was partially reduced by investments for preparing the future. H1 2022 included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia. In H1 2023, further progress was made on compliance related topics which allowed provisions to be released.

The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in the middle of the decade. On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. Tactical adjustments to production planning will continue to be made as required to meet this target rate, which is now the key reference point for the Company and the supply chain. The recent inauguration of a new A321 capable final assembly line in Toulouse is the latest concrete milestone in the development of Airbus’ global industrial system. On the A321XLR, the flight test programme is progressing towards the expected entry-into-service in Q2 2024.

On widebody aircraft, the Company continues to target rate 4 for the A330 in 2024 and rate 9 for the A350 at the end of 2025.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 274 million (H1 2022: € 215 million), reflecting the solid performance across programmes and services. H1 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 78 million (H1 2022: € 155 million), mainly reflecting the decrease in revenues as well as updated assumptions on some long-term contracts, consistent with the difficult environment of the Division's Space business. H1 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. No further net material impact was recognised in the first half of 2023. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 1,431 million (H1 2022: € 1,256 million).

Consolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 1,887 million (H1 2022: € 2,579 million), including net Adjustments of € -731 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ -651 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -291 million were in Q2. This is mainly linked to the phasing impact arising from the difference between transaction date and delivery date;

€ -34 million related to the Aerostructures transformation, of which € -25 million were in Q2;

€ -46 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -32 million were in Q2.

The financial result was € 102 million (H1 2022: € 107 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments, partly offset by the net interest result and negative impacts from the revaluation of financial instruments. Consolidated net income(3) was € 1,526 million (H1 2022: € 1,901 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 1.94 (H1 2022: € 2.42).

Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was € 1,574 million (H1 2022: € 1,955 million), reflecting progress on deliveries as well as an increase in inventory linked to the ongoing ramp-up across programmes. It also includes a favourable timing of receipts and payments.

Consolidated free cash flow was € 1,474 million (H1 2022: € 1,646 million). The gross cash position stood at € 22.9 billion at the end of June 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 9.1 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion).

Outlook

The guidance issued in February 2023 is maintained.

As the basis for its 2023 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2023 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2023 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 6.0 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.0 billion.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Free Cash Flow (FCF) For the definition of the alternative performance measure Free Cash Flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1.

The facility, which will be used to build and test demonstrators for a range of programmes and research projects, was opened by Nusrat Ghani, UK Minister of State at the Department for Business and Trade.

The new facility will help Airbus accelerate the design, build and testing of wings for next generation aircraft, by using the latest technology and world-leading demonstrators to further improve the performance of its wings.

Alongside engine optimisation, making wings longer, leaner and lighter is one of the biggest opportunities to improve fuel efficiency, reduce CO2 and ultimately work towards the aviation industry’s ambition to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Airbus Head of Filton site and Wing of Tomorrow Programme Sue Partridge explains,

“The new Wing Technology Development Centre will help us to ground our research in practicality. A key element of how we deliver technology for next generation aircraft wings is through Wing of Tomorrow (WoT), our largest research and technology programme led by the team in the UK.

“Last week, we achieved a critical milestone in the programme when our second wing demonstrator was completed by the team in Broughton, Wales and delivered to the WTDC. Here it will be prepared for structural testing in our Aerospace Integrated Research and Technology Centre (AIRTeC).”

The WoT programme allows Airbus to explore new manufacturing and assembly technologies so future generations can continue to benefit from flying.

“It’s about preparing our people, technology, industrial system, supply chain and digital and physical capabilities for next generation aircraft. We’re leveraging industry partners and the very best digital tools and automation to identify potential technology bottlenecks that may slow us down in the future. The foundations we lay now will help us build better and faster when the time comes.”

The WTDC adds to Airbus' existing research and technology footprint in the UK, including the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) in Broughton and both the ZEROe Development Centre and Aerospace Integrated Research & Test Centre (AIRTeC) at its Filton site.

Since 2014, Airbus has been awarded £117 million by the Aerospace Technology Institute for Wing of Tomorrow related research.

It was the last launch of Ariane 5, the European heavy launcher.

SYRACUSE 4B, along with SYRACUSE 4A already in orbit, constitutes the space segment of SYRACUSE IV, the fourth generation secure military satellite communications system for the French Armament General Directorate (DGA - Direction Générale de l’Armement), the French Air and Space force and the French Space Command, built by the industrial consortium formed by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space.

SYRACUSE 4A and 4B will deliver increased capacity and enhanced functionality for the French Armed Forces, including higher throughput and flexibility, along with a broader coverage area. The increased flexibility will ensure the satellites can meet the needs of forces deployed anywhere in the coverage area, while also efficiently managing its X-band and Ka-band resources.

“Observation, signal intelligence, space situational awareness, and of course secure communications across key theatres of operation, are paramount for a nation’s autonomy and freedom of action. Airbus is proud to be a trusted partner of the French Armed Forces: thanks to SYRACUSE 4B, and other programmes, we support our national ambitions and capabilities in all these fields, today and in the decades to come!” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.

SYRACUSE 4B, built on Airbus’ Eurostar E3000 platform, in its full-electric variant and equipped with in-orbit proximity surveillance, is embarking the same payload as SYRACUSE 4A, built by Thales Alenia Space with key components provided by Airbus.

SYRACUSE 4B features critical technologies such as anti-jamming, to guarantee service continuity and resilience, cyber-defence and data encryption technologies.

In the frame of the global SYRACUSE co-contract, Airbus is responsible for the SYRACUSE 4B satellite. Thales Alenia Space was responsible for SYRACUSE 4A satellite as well as both payloads with key component provided by Airbus.

The satellite, a true example of pan-European industrial cooperation, will guarantee French sovereignty, while also being able to support operations led by NATO and other allied nations."
The Government of Canada orders 4 new Airbus A330 MRTTs - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNy10aGUtZ292ZXJubWVudC1vZi1jYW5hZGEtb3JkZXJzLTQtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLW1ydHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Additionally, 5 commercial A330s to be converted

First delivery scheduled in 2027

@AirbusDefence #A330MRTT #DefenceMatters #Canada

Getafe, Spain / Ottawa, Canada - 25 July 2023 – The Government of Canada has awarded Airbus Defence and Space with a contract for four newly-built Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft (MRTT) and for the conversion of five used A330-200s in a quest to strengthen Canada’s continental defence capabilities. The current contract has an order value of approximately CAD $3 billion or 2.1€ billion (excluding taxes).

Known as the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC), this new fleet of aircraft will replace the ageing CC-150 Polaris (A310 MRTT), operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The existing A310 fleet is being used to perform air-to-air refuelling operations, military and personnel and cargo airlift, medical evacuations, as well as strategic transport of Government of Canada officials.

“As the world’s most advanced multirole tanker aircraft, the A330 MRTT perfectly matches Canada’s needs to protect its sovereignty as well as to enhance operations both in the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) as well as in NATO,” said Mike Schoellhorn, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defence and Space. “Canada achieves this enhancement of operations not only by improving interoperability with other allied A330 MRTT customer nations but also due to the aircraft’s technological primacy ahead of the global competition.”

The newly-built A330-200s will be assembled at the A330 aircraft Final Assembly Line in Toulouse, France. Scheduled to enter into conversion at A330 MRTT facilities in Getafe, Spain, in mid-2025, the first MRTT will be delivered to the RCAF in 2027.

Under the agreement, the A330 MRTTs will be equipped with both the hose and drogue and a boom as refuelling options, cybersecurity solutions and countermeasures. All of them could be installed with the also included Airbus Medical Evacuation kit solution, consisting of 2 Intensive Care Units and additional stretchers.

The contract covers a full suite of training services including the most advanced training devices such as the Full Flight Simulator to prepare and maintain crew readiness as part of the modernisation of the Canadian Armed Forces’ air operational training infrastructure.

Following an open procurement process, in April 2021, Airbus was selected as the only qualified supplier for the CC-150 tanker replacement. With 76 orders from 15 customers and able to carry up to 300 troops, the A330 MRTT accumulates 90 percent market share outside the U.S.A. and more than 270,000 flight hours. As a mature platform, the aircraft has been proven in combat in theatres of operations like the Middle East and the Eastern Flank in Europe, with interoperability, mission success and availability rates as highlights of its performance.

Airbus has been a leading industrial player in Canada’s aerospace sector for almost 40 years. The company employs over 4,000 people locally and sources approximately CAD $2 billion from Canadian companies.

"At Airbus, SAF-fuelled ferry flights are cleared for take off - Airbus","Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LWF0LWFpcmJ1cy1zYWYtZnVlbGxlZC1mZXJyeS1mbGlnaHRzLWFyZS1jbGVhcmVkLWZvci10YWtlLW9mZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is convinced that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will play a major role in decarbonising aviation. In fact, we’ve already set ourselves a goal: to reach 10% pure SAF in the fuel mix of our own operations in 2023. We want to cover ferry flights too, which are when airlines fly a new aircraft to its home base. Airbus is offering up to 5%-pure SAF, free of charge, to customers taking delivery of aircraft in Toulouse and Hamburg.

Airbus’ ambition is to play an active role in promoting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a credible and efficient lever for decarbonisation. Being a leader means taking concrete actions, including when accompanying our customers.

Already this year, Airbus has committed to using 10%-pure SAF in our commercial aircraft and helicopter internal operations. Now we are offering up to 5%-pure SAF free of charge to customers departing from the Toulouse and Hamburg delivery centres. The first airline to benefit from this offer was Indigo, whose new A320neo took off from Toulouse on 3 July.

Airbus’ SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emission reduction were validated in January 2023. Actively supporting the adoption of SAF is key to meeting those targets.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel explained by Airbus' experts

At their discretion, customers ferrying aircraft from our Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, delivery centres to their home base are already offered varying concentrations of SAF. Now our delivery teams are offering 5%-pure SAF to all* customers departing Toulouse, and from September, to those taking delivery in Hamburg.

To achieve this objective, Airbus has secured 6,805 hectolitres (HL) of SAF with different blend ratios, ranging from 30 to 49%. This will create around 18,000 HL, or 475,500 US gallons, of blended SAF for 2023 alone.

Indigo was the first airline to take advantage of this offer, with an A320neo departing Toulouse for Delhi in early July.

*Contractual terms and conditions apply

“Naturally Airbus’ ambition goes beyond 2023. We’re working to secure SAF supplies into next year and beyond, for ferry flights departing all our delivery centres,” says Airbus’ head of SAF and fuel efficiency Julien Manhes. “We’re sending a strong signal to our customers, the fuel ecosystem, and the wider sector: SAF has arrived.”

Airbus recently announced a partnership with LanzaJet to support building SAF facilities which will use LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology pathway and accelerate the certification and adoption of 100% drop-in SAF, which would allow existing aircraft to fly without fossil fuels.

Yet another step to investigate and support certification of 100% drop-in SAF, the partnership follows last year’s announcement with renewables producer Neste that sees the two companies cooperate to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation fuels. Airbus is fully engaged in boosting SAF production worldwide.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is an approved fuel for aviation that is a blend of up to 50% synthetic components made from waste products and kerosene. The synthetic component produces an average 80% fewer carbon emissions over its life cycle than conventional jet fuel."
"Higher production goals, new aircraft (2012) - Airbus","Sun, 02 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vd2hvLXdlLWFyZS9vdXItaGlzdG9yeS9jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWhpc3RvcnkvaGlnaGVyLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZ29hbHMtbmV3LWFpcmNyYWZ0LTIwMTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the momentum created by a “year of records” in 2011, Airbus set its sights in 2012 on goals that include further production ramp-up for the company’s jetliner families, final assembly of the initial A350 XWB aircraft, and certification of the A320 product line’s Sharklets fuel-saving wingtip devices – all of which will be supported by additional growth in its employee count.

The planned production acceleration will raise Airbus’ output for its best-selling A320 Family in 2012 to an all-time high of approximately 42 aircraft monthly, with the A380 cadence moving toward three per month, and production of the A330 rising to meet a goal of 9.5 jetliners monthly. To meet these increased production rates – while also securing major programme milestones for the new A350, A320neo and A400M military airlifter – Airbus is keeping a focus on expanding its workforce’s size, skills and talent – adding at least 4,000 more employees in 2012, which follows the 4,500 new recruits hired the previous year. Driven by its exceptional sales performance in 2011, Airbus entered 2012 with a backlog of 4,437 aircraft – representing a combined list price value estimated at $588 billion. This included 1,256 firm bookings for the A320neo Family by 23 customers, confirming its status as the fasting-selling jetliner ever, and bringing overall sales for the entire A320 Family to 8,292 aircraft as of 31 December 2011.

In January 2012, A330 production reached a rate of nine aircraft per month to meet international demand.

The A350 XWB takes shape New programme milestones achieved in 2012 for Airbus’ A350 XWB have brought this next-generation wide-body jetliner closer to its maiden flight. Airbus officially unveiled the A350 XWB’s final assembly line in Toulouse, France with a 23 October ceremony that spotlighted the first two airframes to be built: the no. 1 aircraft constructed for flight (designated MSN1 in the company’s numbering system), along with an airframe for ground-based testing. The new purpose-built industrial site incorporates 53,000 square metres of aircraft assembly halls and 19,000 square metres of annexes – including offices, workshops and logistics areas. It was constructed near Airbus’ existing A330 production facilities to provide an optimisation of resources. This production facility – named after Airbus visionary Roger Béteille – was built within 29 months, and is the greenest final assembly line ever constructed by Airbus. With a new lighting system, roof-mounted photovoltaic solar panels, translucent panels and glass arched roofs, it is capable of producing energy equivalent to 55% of its own needs.

The first A350 XWB flight test aircraft is shown outside of Airbus’ Toulouse, France final assembly line.

A350 XWB MSN1 completed its overall structural assembly and system connections in late 2012, enabling its early December transfer from the final assembly line’s main assembly hall (Station 40) to the adjacent indoor ground test station (Station 30). Assembly work performed while the aircraft was in Station 40 included the electrical power-on of its entire fuselage and wings. Station 30 activity will start by testing the aircraft's hydraulic system, followed by the full electric and hydraulic power-on of the aircraft, marking the start of several weeks of comprehensive functional system testing. MSN1 is an A350-900 version – the A350 XWB Family’s intermediate-sized member. Airbus’ second aircraft to be assembled also is sized as an A350-900, and this airframe is to be used for ground-based testing to validate the jetliner’s structural design. It was moved in November from the Roger Béteille Final Assembly Line to Airbus’ L34 static test hall – situated across the airport in the Lagardère industrial zone. This clears the way for the airframe to be integrated into a test rig for nearly a year of evaluations, including limit load and ultimate load validations, along with residual strength and margin research. In other programme developments during 2012, the A350 XWB’s new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine went airborne in February, installed on the dedicated A380 flying testbed aircraft. From its first flight, this powerplant demonstrated its new-generation fuel efficiency and low noise levels. With its start-up approximately one year prior to the A350 XWB’s planned maiden takeoff, the engine flight test evaluations are to accumulate around 175 flight hours – some three times more airborne flying hours than on previous programmes. This will be accomplished over a seven-month period, and will include hot weather as well as icing condition testing campaigns, along with validation of the advanced nacelle and thrust reverser system.

Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB engine is shown installed on the A380 flying testbed aircraft.

The 5,000th A320 delivery... and more A320 orders Not surprisingly, many of Airbus’ programme and commercial milestones in 2012 were related to the A320 Family, including delivery of the 5,000th aircraft to Middle East Airlines of Lebanon in January, as well as two historic bookings in December: an order for 100 additional A320 jetliners by AirAsia, and Pegasus Airlines’ signing for up to 100 A320neo Family aircraft. As of December 18, the A320 Family logged 8,800 aircraft ordered and 5,300 jetliners delivered to over 380 customers and operators across the globe, making the A320 Family the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft family. Key bookings during the first six months included an acquisition of 100 A320neo jetliners by Norwegian – one of the largest low-cost airlines in Europe – positioning this carrier as a new customer for Airbus. Additionally, AviancaTaca firmed up an order for 51 A320s, making it the largest purchase agreement for a single customer in Latin America history. The second half of 2012 also was highly successful thanks in part to AirAsia’s new order in December for an additional 64 A320neo and 36 A320ceo aircraft, reaffirming the airline’s position as the world’s largest A320 Family customer. The company’s current all-A320 fleet services some 70 destinations in 20 countries across Asia. Later in December, Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines – the country’s second-largest carrier – became a new Airbus customer when it signed for as many as 100 A320neo Family aircraft (57 A320neo and 18 A321neo), of which 75 were firm orders. It marks the largest single commercial aircraft order ever placed by a Turkish carrier. Pegasus will use the jetliners to service the company’s rapidly-expanding network from Istanbul to destinations in Turkey, Europe and the Middle East. In the U.S., the A320neo’s acceptance in the market was underscored in 2012 with Spirit Airlines’ firming up of a 45-aircraft booking, along with an order for 30 A320s. These new aircraft will be used on Spirit’s growing network of flights in the domestic United States, Caribbean and Latin America, and will join the A320 Family aircraft successfully operated by the airline for the past seven years.

Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines received the milestone 5,000th A320 Family jetliner built by Airbus in January 2012.

Fuel-saving A320 Family “Sharklets” Airbus’ application of its fuel-saving and performance-enhancing Sharklet large wingtip devices on the A318, A319, A320 and A321 jetliners marked numerous milestones in 2012, culminating in December with AirAsia becoming the first carrier to receive a Sharklets-equipped jetliner. Achievements included a roll-out of the initial new-build A320 fitted with Sharklets in April as one of eight aircraft being used in the test campaign for these devices in their production-standard version. It was accompanied in October 2012 by the initial Sharklets-equipped A321, and was joined one month later by the no. 1 A319 with these devices. The Sharklets – which decrease aerodynamic drag by helping reduce the spiral-shaped vortices formed at aircraft wingtips during flight – are offered as an option on members of the in-production A320ceo (current engine option) A320 Family, and will be standard on Airbus’ A320neo (new engine option) jetliners. In December, Airbus announced certification of the first jetliner/engine combination with Sharklets approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) airworthiness authority: the A320 powered by CFM International’s CFM56 powerplant. It was this A320 version that AirAsia, a major low-cost carrier and the largest A320 Family airline customer, received later in the same month – positioning it to become the world’s first operator of a jetliner with Sharklets.

AirAsia became the world’s first airline to receive an A320 fitted with Airbus’ new fuel saving Sharklets.

90-plus A380s delivered The popularity of Airbus’ 21st century flagship aircraft – the A380 – continued to spread in 2012. A new programme milestone was reached in May with delivery of Malaysia Airlines’ initial aircraft – making it the eighth carrier worldwide to receive an A380. This 75th delivery overall was the first of six that Malaysia Airlines has on order, and it is to be used for operations on the Kuala Lumpur-London route. Delivered at Airbus’ Toulouse headquarters location, it incorporates a new livery including a modern interpretation of the Malaysian “wau” moon-kite national symbol, as well as an updated logo for the carrier. In June, Transaero Airlines became Airbus’ first customer for the A380 in Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Eastern Europe when it completed a purchase agreement for four aircraft. These jetliners will seat approximately 700 people in a three-class cabin layout and are expected to be used on the airline’s higher density routes from Moscow. Thai Airways International (THAI) became the ninth carrier worldwide to add Airbus’ A380 to its fleet with the September handover of the airline’s no. 1 aircraft – named Si Rattena, or “Majestic Jewel” – at a special ceremony in Toulouse, France. THAI has ordered six aircraft in total, with each to accommodate 507 passengers in a premium three-class layout with a new cabin design. First class is equipped with 12 private suites while the Royal Silk Class contains 60 fully flat sleeper seats. All seats are equipped with the latest on-demand in-flight entertainment systems, communications outlets and individual power supplies. This jetliner – which is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines – began operations on the company’s Bangkok-Hong Kong and Bangkok-Singapore routes when it entered service. THAI is expected to begin service using A380s to Frankfurt at the end of the year, as well as to Tokyo and Paris in early 2013 as more aircraft are delivered. From the A380’s October 2007 introduction through September 2012, more than 650,000 total revenue flight hours were logged by the jetliners during operations worldwide – representing a combined cumulative time aloft of nearly 75 years. The A380 fleet was performing one departure or landing every seven minutes, with an average daily utilisation of 13.4 hrs. per aircraft. As of end-November 2012, Airbus had delivered more than 90 A380s to the nine airlines: Air France, China Southern, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and THAI.

The no. 1 A380 for Malaysia Airlines was handed over to MAS Group Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya in Toulouse, France.

Giving mature A330 jetliners a new career The A330 Passenger-to-Freighter (P2F) conversion programme was given its start in 2012 through an agreement involving EADS EFW (a sister company in the EADS group) and Singapore’s ST Aerospace. The A330P2F programme offers a passenger-to-freighter conversion opportunity for A330s that have completed their useful operational service as passenger jetliners. Both the A330-200 and A330-300 versions are eligible for the P2F conversion. With its longer fuselage, the A330-300P2F is particularly suited for integrators and express carriers, resulting from its high volumetric payload capability with lower-density cargo, while the A330-200P2F is optimised for higher-density freight and longer-range performance. The A330 offers a highly capable platform for conversion into a freighter, with modern Airbus technologies that include fly-by-wire flight controls. Overall, more than 1,180 A330s have been ordered in the passenger, freighter, VIP, and military aerial tanker/transport versions, with over 800 delivered from the A330’s service entry in 1994 through early 2012 – providing a large source of aircraft to support these conversions for many years. A330P2F aircraft will be complementary to Airbus’ new-production A330-200F freighters, as the converted jetliners address a different price-point and end-users, based on separate operational requirements.

Airbus’ A330-200 and its longer-fuselage A330-300 version will both be eligible for the passenger-to-freighter conversion.

Fabrice Brégier named President and CEO Airbus marked a key management change on 1 June as Fabrice Brégier became the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Brégier had served as Airbus Chief Operating Officer since 2006, and succeeds Tom Enders, who takes the duties as CEO of parent company EADS. During his previous COO role, Brégier worked on the implementation of Airbus’ company-wide restructuring and change program, while also overseeing Executive Committee actions involving operations, engineering and procurement. With Brégier now “at the controls,” the focus will be on increasing Airbus’ global footprint while also ramping-up production. Succeeding Brégier as the Airbus COO is Guenter Butschek, who is now in charge of operations, engineering, procurement, quality and lean, information technology and communications technology.

Fabrice Brégier took over as President and CEO of Airbus after serving as the company’s Chief Operating Officer since 2006.

Focus on eco-efficiency: an A319 “perfect flight” Airbus and Air Canada joined to perform North America’s first-ever commercial “Perfect Flight” on 18 June, using one of the airline’s A319s flown from Toronto to Mexico City with the goal of cutting CO2 emissions by more than 40% compared to a regular trip. This “Perfect Flight” combined the Airbus A320 Family’s capabilities as a modern state-of-the-art airliner series, powered by a sustainable alternative 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel blend made with used cooking oil, and employing streamlined air traffic management procedures – all facilitated through best practice operations to underpin the airline industry’s strategy to tackle carbon emissions. The cross-border activity follows the first “Perfect Flight” achieved in November 2011, which used an Air France A321 flying on a domestic French segment from Toulouse to Paris.

North America’s first “Perfect Flight” was performed by an Airbus A319 jetliner from Air Canada.

Expanding production and the global footprint Airbus announced on 2 July that it will establish the company’s first U.S.-based production facility in Mobile, Alabama. This new A320 Family final assembly line – which is part of a strategy to enhance the company’s global competitiveness as well as bring it closer to North American customers – will produce the single-aisle A319, A320 and A321 and is expected to start operation in 2015, with first deliveries beginning in 2016. The strategy expands and enhances Airbus’ U.S. presence, while adding another company facility in the state of Alabama, which currently is home to an engineering centre at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, as well as an Airbus Military customer service operation that also is located in Mobile. Airbus’ new A320 Family final assembly line will involve an estimated investment of approximately $600 million, and is to consist of 53 acres of buildings, aprons and roadways contained within a 116 acre site.

Airbus’ A320 Family final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama, USA was announced by the company on 2 July.

Customers confirm Airbus’ product line strategy The 2012 Farnborough Airshow brought new airline industry backing for Airbus’ commercial and industrial strategies, with additional single-aisle and wide-body jetliner orders announced and endorsements received for two of its enhanced aircraft. During the week-long international event, Airbus announced the launch of an increased maximum takeoff weight for its twin-engine A330, further enhancing the operating range and payload capability of this long-popular jetliner. This takeoff weight boost to 240 metric tonnes includes the integration of aerodynamic technologies from the A350 XWB programme, along with enhancements to the aircraft’s jet engines. CIT Group Inc. placed the first order for this increased takeoff weight A330 version two days after the launch announcement was made, adding to the transportation finance company’s already large portfolio of the jetliners available for lessors. In November, Airbus announced a further improvement of the A330 takeoff weight, with an increase to 242 metric tonnes for both the A330-200 and A330-300 versions. This upgrade also provides an increased fuel capacity option for the larger A330-300, and builds on the enhancements announced during the Farnborough Airshow. Another key development at the biennial Farnborough event was Cathay Pacific’s choice to incorporate 26 A350-1000s into its fleet, validating Airbus’ action in 2011 to improve the A350-1000 version of its A350 XWB wide-body jetliner family with a higher-thrust engine and an increased takeoff weight. Overall, Airbus announced 115 new sales and commitments during the Farnborough Airshow, which also included 57 commitments for the A320ceo (current engine option) family – demonstrating this is still the industry’s benchmark single-aisle aircraft product line, along with 29 bookings for the A320neo (new engine option).

Cathay Pacific Airways announced an agreement to purchase 10 A350-1000 jetliners at the 2012 Farnborough International Airshow.

Tianjin assembly line completes 100th A320 Family aircraft The Airbus A320 Final Assembly Line China (FALC) achieved a production milestone in August with completion of the 100th single-aisle aircraft built at the Tianjin facility. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao presided over a celebration of this accomplishment, which was attended by some 1,000 people. One day prior to the event, a framework agreement was signed by Airbus, the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China to continue cooperation on this joint-venture assembly line beyond the current business plan – which is due to expire in 2016. Opened in August 2008, the Tianjin site is the third A320 Family final assembly line worldwide, and is Airbus’ first outside of Europe. Aircraft delivered from the complex have been received by 11 Chinese operators, while more than 500 A320 Family jetliners have been ordered in China since the Tianjin project’s original agreement was signed. The milestone 100th Chinese-built Airbus jetliner was delivered to Air China in September, with this A320 planned for operation on domestic routes linking Shanghai to other cities in the country.

Completion of the 100th A320 Family aircraft at Tianjin is celebrated.

Eyes on the dark side – successful launch for Euclid spacecraft - Airbus,"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNy1leWVzLW9uLXRoZS1kYXJrLXNpZGUtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1sYXVuY2gtZm9yLWV1Y2xpZC1zcGFjZWNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 1 July 2023 – The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid science spacecraft has been successfully launched from Kennedy Space Centre. A high-precision 1.2m diameter telescope and payload module designed and built by Airbus will enable Euclid to explore the composition and evolution of the Universe including the role of dark matter and dark energy.

Built by Thales Alenia Space for ESA, Euclid will collect high-resolution images in visible and infrared wavelengths. Within six years of observation, covering more than one third of the entire sky, Euclid will measure the shapes of, and distances to, more than 1 billion galaxies.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “Euclid is another world-inspiring space mission that will aid humanity’s understanding of the structure and evolution of the Universe. This is the largest telescope with the highest optical performance ever designed and integrated by Airbus and testament to the skills and expertise of our space instruments team.”

Euclid will create a map of the large-scale structure of the Universe and will explore how the Universe has expanded and how structure has formed over cosmic history, revealing more about the role of gravity and dark energy.

Euclid will also examine the effects of “weak lensing”, an effect that distorts the shapes of distant galaxy images due to the presence of dark matter between the Earth and those galaxies. In this way it will map out the distribution of dark matter across the Universe with unprecedented accuracy.

The full silicon carbide (SiC) telescope will have to operate in extremely cold conditions of 100 Kelvin (-170°C), it builds on Airbus’ world-leading expertise in silicon carbide technology for space, already proven in orbit on ESA’s Herschel and Gaia missions.

Euclid is a “Medium Class” mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme. Thales Alenia Space was the industrial prime contractor for the satellite and Airbus was responsible for the payload module, of which the telescope is the main instrument.

Euclid will reach its operational orbit around Lagrange 2 four weeks after launch when testing will begin, with full operations expected to start after three months.

Note to Editors:

Dark matter cannot be detected directly but astronomers know it is to be there because of its gravitational effects on the matter they can see, and galaxies could not hold their shape without some additional mass which is presumed to be dark matter.

Dark energy is a mysterious force that appears to be making the Universe expand more quickly. Euclid will help investigate dark energy by mapping the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies to work out the rate of expansion.

Airbus' military aircraft flight test team pushes the limits and beyond - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS1haXJjcmFmdC1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdC10ZWFtLXB1c2hlcy10aGUtbGltaXRzLWFuZC1iZXlvbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The motto of our team is ‘to the edge and beyond’. It reflects our mission: to ensure that every aircraft we deliver is safe and that all its operators are able to carry out every mission.”

Ignacio Lombo heads Airbus Defence and Space's Flight Test team, which consists of around 50 pilots, flight engineers, flight mechanics, loadmasters and A330 MRTT boom operators and UAV operators. They are responsible both for flying the aircraft before delivery and for working with engineering teams to develop the capabilities of combat aircraft such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, military transport aircraft such as the A400M and C295, and refuelling aircraft such as the A330 MRTT.

Testing and developing aircraft for those who defend our freedom

The majority of Airbus' flight test team comes from the military, creating an unbreakable bond with the end users: the members of the armed forces who put themselves in harm's way to defend national sovereignty and stability.

Carlos Pinilla, call sign Pini, has more than 32 years of experience as a flight test pilot. ""We are qualified to fly many different aircraft, from flight envelope testing in a campaign to ground taxiing. One day we might be flying an A400M at an airshow, the next day a Eurofighter, the next week a training mission with a customer. Whatever the customer needs.""

""We are fully aware of what we are doing, our job is to minimise risk. If we make a bad product, we will put the Air Force, which guarantees our security, in difficulty. It is a vocation of service to society that we never forget,"" stresses Eurofighter test pilot Carlos Pinilla, a former Spanish Air Force pilot. A spirit shared by everyone on the flight test team. ""I've never forgotten what my former German Air Force Commander told me when I joined Airbus: 'Whenever you're in your new job, don't forget where you came from. All the development work we do is for them: my responsibility is to provide the best possible defence system for the Air Force to the best of my ability,"" says Stephan Leuthner, Experimental Test Pilot and Project Pilot for the Future Combat Air System's Next Generation Fighter.



Over the years, Airbus has delivered some 1,900 military aircraft whose capabilities continue to evolve throughout their service life. ""Our relationship with the air forces is very close, it's a give and take. With a constantly evolving fighter, there will always be issues to be resolved, so our job is to identify them and share the necessary information with the operational pilots,” explains Stephan.

Stephan Leuther, an aerospace engineer by training, became a pilot in the German Air Force in 1997 and received his pilot wings, also known as aviation or pilot badges, from his father in 2005. Stephan's call sign is Grisù [a young dragon who dreams of becoming a firefighter, a character from an Italian cartoon series from the 60s and 70s].

He and his colleagues are currently working on improving the weapons integration, electronics and intelligence capabilities of the German Tornado fleet, while the focus for the Eurofighter is the integration of the Electronically-Scanned (E-Scan) radar. ""It will give fighter pilots an improved, much broader situational picture, while detecting multiple ground and air targets simultaneously and more quickly. It is an amazing system, it will be the best on the market and it will make the pilot's job easier"".

From military transport with the A400M and A330 MRTT to the Eurofighter

""The difference between flying a military transport like the A400M and a fighter like the Eurofighter is a bit like driving a Mercedes in the Dakar Rally and a Ferrari. They have different speeds and accelerations, with a much higher level of interaction in the fighter cockpit,"" explains Ignacio Lombo.

""The Eurofighter is a performance machine, like a Formula 1 car, and all decisions have to be made quickly and with a high degree of confidence,"" continues Stephan, who also tests Airbus A320 aircraft. ""In the civilian world, the challenge is communication with the crew and complex scenarios such as landing in crosswinds with poor visibility.""

""In a tanker like the A330 MRTT, the flight is much calmer, it's like a ballet dance,"" says Jesús Ruiz, a military transport and fighter test pilot. ""What is different is the coordination with the fuel-receiving aircraft and the boom operator, rather than the pure flight management."" He is leading the flight test campaign for the Auto'Mate project, which is developing autonomous and unmanned air-to-air refuelling technologies.

""In reality, what makes a mission more complex is the tactical environment. The number of aircraft involved, the number of enemy radars, if you have limited time, weather restrictions, if the operation is at night or involves flying at low altitude... The secret is to be prepared for everything, from a refuelling or medical evacuation mission that can last 16 hours to a 15-minute Eurofighter air policing mission,"" adds Jesús.

During COVID-19 in 2020, Jesús Ruiz coordinated a 23-hour, 30-minute round-trip A330 flight from Getafe to Tianjin, China, to deliver medical supplies and masks to Europe's national health services. ""Everyone contributed, from the A400M colleagues to the Spanish Air Force, who provided 200 cargo straps and 20 cargo nets. Thanks to the tremendous effort of all the teams, we were able to turn a commercial aircraft into a cargo aircraft in a single weekend.

""If I had to choose, I would say that air-to-air refuelling as a receiver was the most challenging capability in the development of the A400M,"" Ignacio reflects. ""Through various steps, we gradually defined the flight control laws to perform the receiver role in a simple way compared to other platforms. As a pilot, it was fantastic to fly on different flight control laws and, step by step, we managed to achieve the perfect manoeuvrability of the aircraft"".

Ignacio Lombo has been at the heart of the A400M development from the very beginning. ""We pushed the test aircraft to the limit in terms of speed, Mach, height, altitude, load factor (Gs) and almost tore its skin off! The A400M has exceeded all expectations in all types of operations with superior performance"".

What makes a good pilot?

Aviation pioneer Wilbur Wright said it was possible to fly without engines, but not without knowledge and skill. ""Another essential quality of a pilot is calmness, as well as the ability to analyse. You have to control your reactions, because faster is not always better. You have to make decisions at the right time and have the knowledge of the situation that only experience can give you,"" says Ignacio, whose vocation, like that of many of the members of his team, stems from his family background. ""I've always smelled kerosene in my house. I ate in the pavilions with the pilots, watched the planes and was always fascinated by them,"" he says.

Ignacio Lombo

The same passion beats in the heart of Stephan Leuthner, who has dreamed of becoming a pilot since his first flight in a motor glider at the age of 6. ""You have to be aggressive in the way you pursue your goals during a flight and have a lot of self-confidence, but you also have to be self-reflective, don't act like a cowboy. The most important quality of a good flight test pilot is honesty: be aware of your limitations, keep improving, and if you see a problem, assess whether it was your fault or a problem with the aircraft. Other people's lives depend on your honesty.”

Stephan Leuthner

Jesús Ruiz points out another essential characteristic of a good pilot: the ""we"" versus the ""I"". ""Teamwork is a fundamental part of our DNA. For example, you can fly in a formation of 3 or 4 fighters and in the middle of an operation the dynamics change and you take over the leadership of the team. Knowing how to follow is as important as knowing how to lead.

""Being a pilot is made up of an infinite number of small daily victories,"" summarises Carlos Pinilla, who as a child collected aviation badges and models and made his own aeroplane albums by cutting out photos from magazines.

""There are many special moments in your career: your first flight, when you change aircraft, your first international exercise, the first time you fly as a mission commander... But in reality, being a pilot is about taking off and landing every day, those little daily victories""."
Delta Air Lines discloses order for 12 additional A220 aircraft - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wNy1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtZGlzY2xvc2VzLW9yZGVyLWZvci0xMi1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWEyMjAtYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Herndon, USA/Mirabel, Canada - 13 July 2023 – Under its current agreement, Delta Air Lines has disclosed an order for 12 additional A220-300 aircraft, bringing the airline’s total firm order for A220s to 131 aircraft - 45 A220-100s and 86 A220-300.

Airbus and Boeing race to boost aircraft production - Tech Xplore,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYm9vc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDctYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1ib29zdC1haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Airbus and Boeing are racing to boost production rates to meet a surge in orders from airlines.

Airbus and Boeing both stepped up deliveries of commercial aircraft in the first half of this year, boosting revenue as they strive to ramp up production to meet demand from airlines.

Both aircraft manufacturers released results on Wednesday, with Airbus reporting a net profit of 1.06 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in the second quarter while Boeing suffered a $149 million loss following delays and cost issues in its defense and space program.

Both saw revenues jump as they delivered more aircraft to clients. Boeing boosted revenue by 18 percent during the quarter to $19.8 billion, while Airbus posted a 24 percent increase to $17.6 billion.

In the second quarter, US-based Boeing notched a 12 percent increase in commercial plane deliveries to 136.

Its European rival Airbus managed a 6.4 percent increase to 316 deliveries in the first half of the year.

As airlines have announced major new orders in response to robust travel demand following COVID-19 lockdowns, Airbus and Boeing have had trouble boosting production.

Both companies slashed output and cut staff during the pandemic as global air travel came to a near halt, and ramping it back up has proved slow and difficult for them and their suppliers.

'Steady progress'

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun pointed to ""steady progress"" in the aerospace giant's turnaround, calling demand strong in the company press release.

Boeing's commercial plane program has been beset with various manufacturing and quality control issues in recent years that have limited deliveries for its top-selling jets, the 737 and 787 Dreamliner, pushing the company into loss.

In an interview on CNBC, Calhoun described the supply chain difficulties as ""settling down"" as he reviewed the ramp-up planned for the best-selling jets and reviewed a number of major contracts with carriers in India, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.

Calhoun offered a somewhat more upbeat appraisal Wednesday as he mapped out the plan to increase production of the 737 MAX to 38 a month from 31 a month.

""Suppliers have been working diligently to sort of settle down and eliminate the constraints, and slowly and steadily we're seeing fewer and fewer concerns,"" Calhoun told CNBC, adding that the company plans to boost output to 50 per month down the road.

Boeing also announced new production targets for the 787 Dreamliner.

Later on a conference call with analysts, Calhoun characterized supply chain issues as still the ""most significant"" challenge facing the company, but said ""it's steadily getting better"".

Airbus constrained by suppliers

Airbus also highlighted the critical importance of ramping up production and continued supply chain difficulties.

""On the supply side, our deliveries continue to be paced by a few critical suppliers,"" chief executive Guillaume Faury said in a conference call.

Airbus confirmed plans to make 75 of its best-selling single-aisle A320 family aircraft per month in 2026.

This production rate ""is now the key reference point for the company"", it acknowledged.

But it dropped reference to making 65 A320 aircraft per month in 2024.

""Given the volatility in our supply chain and in our operations, we won't give interim targets anymore,"" said Faury.

""The overall trajectory and the landing point is what matters, we'll continue to make tactical adjustments in our production as required,"" he added.

Faury said a problem recently identified with Pratt and Whitney engines for the A320neo would not affect deliveries and Airbus would assist affected clients.

Airbus confirmed its target of delivering around 720 commercial aircraft this year.

Record order book

Faury said demand for its commercial aircraft remained strong, pointing to 800 orders announced at the Paris Air Show.

Net orders totalled 1,044 during the first half of the year, more than four times the amount during the first six months of 2022.

That is already close to its annual totals the past two years and puts Airbus within striking distance of its 2014 record of 1,590 aircraft.

""This demand is driven both by growth and fleet replacement as airlines invest in more fuel efficient fleets,"" said Faury, noting its order book stands at a record 7,967 aircraft.

Airbus' results were held back by a weak performance by its defense and space unit which was hit by a drop in revenues due to delays, although it did return to an operating profit.

Meanwhile, Boeing's defense, space and security business operated at loss, hit by delays in the Starliner spacecraft and increased costs connected to the T-7A jet trainer program.

Even though Boeing's commercial aircraft unit continued to operate at a loss the company beat analyst expectations and investors welcomed its revised production targets, driving the share price up 6.7 percent.

Airbus released its results after European markets closed for the day.

“The inauguration of this new A321-capable final assembly line in Toulouse represents another milestone in the ongoing modernisation of our global industrial system. This FAL will contribute to the ongoing production rate ramp-up to 75 A320 Family aircraft per month in 2026, while meeting the increased demand for A321s which currently represents around 60 percent of the total A320 Family backlog,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “We’re pleased to see this new facility join our worldwide network of final assembly sites which will comprise four FALs in Hamburg, Germany; two in Toulouse, France; two in Mobile, United States; and two in Tianjin, China, all them capable of assembling the A321.”

A variety of innovations feature prominently in this latest A320 Family final assembly line, with the aim of maximising product quality, efficiency, as well as establishing new standards for health, safety and sustainability. These innovations include digital production control using tablets and smartphones to reduce paper consumption, automated logistics for parts distribution and light-weight robots for joining sections.

Installed in the former A380 “Jean-Luc Lagardère” assembly building, the new FAL started initial operations at the end of 2022 with the delivery of the first fuselage sections. The roll-out of the first aircraft fully assembled in this facility - an A321 - is expected to take place by the end of this year. The industrial site will progressively ramp up operations between now and 2025, directly employing around 700 workers.

The helicopter was officially handed over at Szolnok Airbase by Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.



“I am very happy that we have delivered the first H225Ms to Hungary today,” said Bruno Even. “The Defence Forces are receiving a combat-proven, multi-role platform, which is the latest version of a very successful helicopter family. Together with the light twin engine H145M, which is already in operation, Hungary now has a modern helicopter fleet that can fly a broad range of military missions, and we are proud that they decided our helicopters were the right choice for their extremely important operations.”



Additionally, Airbus is also providing an extensive training and support package to ensure the highest level of operational availability.



The H225Ms selected by Hungary are equipped with state-of-the-art communication capabilities and will be used for transport, combat search and rescue, and special operations missions. Its advanced avionics and four axis autopilot, exceptional range and payload capacities, combined with a large cabin designed to carry up to 24 troops and powerful air- to-ground and air-to-surface armament as well as electronic warfare systems allow the H225M to carry out the most demanding missions. The helicopter has an all-weather capability supported by its night vision goggle compatibility.



A part of the Hungarian H225M fleet will be fitted with the HForce weapon management system, adding air support capabilities thus creating further communality with the Hungarian H145M fleet also equipped with HForce. Flight trials have recently been conducted in Hungary as part of the integration of a gun pod and rocket launchers on the Hungarian H225M.

A member of the multi-role Super Puma family of helicopters, this military variant is currently operational in France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Kuwait, and Singapore.

Since then we’ve worked closely with the European Union to develop and certify SLS technology for the A320 Family – which forms the backbone of airline fleets throughout Europe. This project, co-funded under the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme, bore fruit in June 2022 with the delivery of the first SLS-equipped single-aisle aircraft for easyJet. Deliveries are continuing apace, such that during 2023 there will be around 10 easyJet aircraft with SLS – and more likely being added thereafter.

Airline SLS selections increase ahead of Performance-Based Navigation mandate in Europe

Following in the footsteps of easyJet, other airlines are stepping up to implement the SLS option in their respective Airbus single-aisle aircraft. To date around 15 customers – mostly European operators, but also some from overseas – have selected SLS to equip more than 110 A320 Family aircraft, with deliveries taking place during the next couple of years.

Over the longer term, the market uptake for SLS is set to accelerate, especially amongst Europe-based airlines, given that by 2030 an EU mandate, called “PBN IR” (Performance-Based Navigation - Implementing Rule) will come into force. This will eventually mean that traditional CAT1 approaches in Europe will no longer be performed using the analogue and radio-based Instrument Landing System (ILS), and instead operators should use satellite-based procedures.

Synergy with EU’s European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS)

Another synergy of working with the EU is that the SLS technology on the aircraft flying in Europe rely on the space-based external augmentation provided by the EU’s satellite constellation which forms the “European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service”. Known simply as “EGNOS”, these satellites provide SBAS signal augmentation over the European continent, enabling SLS-equipped aircraft to benefit from accurate vertical trajectory guidance during their final approach to the runway. The same on-board SLS technology can also be used by Airbus operators in other continents with equivalent geostationary SBAS constellations, such the US-based Wide-Area-Augmentation System (WAAS) network, and soon the Japanese-based Michibiki Satellite-based Augmentation Service (MSAS) and the Indian-based GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation (GAGAN).

In addition to theA350 and A320, SLS has also been certified for the A330, A380 and A220 Airbus aircraft Families. Overall, Airbus’ customers’ interest for SLS continues to grow as it provides more flexibility and resilience in their network and their operations, while saving fuel and reducing emissions.



Airbus’ SLS capability for the A320 Family has been co-funded by the European Union within the framework of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)."

There's likely to be more air travel disruption on its way because hundreds of Airbus planes will have to undergo engine inspections.

Aerospace and defense conglomerate RTX, announced Tuesday that its subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, which makes aircraft engines, had discovered an issue in some of its engines — which sent its stock down 10% on Tuesday, per Markets Insider data.

The company said a ""rare condition"" contaminated the powder metal used to make ""certain engine parts"" and it could cause cracks to form on critical engine parts, per The Wall Street Journal. More than 1,000 engines will need to be inspected sooner than scheduled.

RTX CEO Greg Hayes told Reuters that it could take up to 60 days to inspect and fix each engine.

Those Pratt & Whitney engines are used on about 40% of the twin-engine Airbus A320neo jets, per the Journal.

And at least 1,200 engines will need to be removed for ""enhanced inspection"" of the high-pressure turbine disc, said Chris Calio, RTX chief operating officer, in the Q2 earnings call.

200 inspections should take place by mid-September, with a further 1,000 in the next nine-to-twelve months, Calio added.

It doesn't impact those currently in production, and Pratt & Whitney will continue to deliver new engines.

But it will cause disruption for airlines using the parts built between 2015 and 2021.

JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, and Wizz Air are among those affected, Reuters reported. A spokesperson for Wizz Air told Insider that 12 out of the more than 400 engines in its fleet will be replaced as part of the first round of inspections.

The other airlines impacted did not immediately return Insider's request for comment, sent outside US working hours.

An Airbus spokesperson said the company is working with its customers and Pratt & Whitney to minimize the disruption and implement the required inspection plans.

The A320neo is a narrow-body airliner that competes with the Boeing 737 MAX.

It was first launched in 2010, and helped Airbus break order records at the following Paris Air Show, France24 reported.

That's because the engines are more fuel-efficient and provided an increased range, allowing more options for transatlantic flights without having to rely on the higher-capacity wide-bodies."
Viva Aerobus Wants Larger Piece of Mexico’s Boom With New Airbus Order - Skift,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy92aXZhLWFlcm9idXMtd2FudHMtbGFyZ2VyLXBpZWNlLW9mLW1leGljb3MtYm9vbS13aXRoLW5ldy1haXJidXMtb3JkZXIv0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9haXJsaW5ld2Vla2x5LnNraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L3ZpdmEtYWVyb2J1cy13YW50cy1sYXJnZXItcGllY2Utb2YtbWV4aWNvcy1ib29tLXdpdGgtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mexican discount airline Viva Aerobus has signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 90 Airbus A321neo aircraft that could more than double its fleet in the coming years as the airline eyes significant growth.

The deal brings the Monterrey, Mexico-based carrier’s orderbook to 170 A320neo family aircraft, according to Airbus Wednesday. Viva Aerobus operates 74 A320 family jets currently. The new A321neos, which will be equipped with Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, will begin arriving in 2027.

The aircraft “will allow us to grow and renew our fleet and remain the youngest in Latin America,” Viva Aerobus CEO Juan Carlos Zuazua said. “The technology and operational efficiency of the A321neos will improve our operational reliability, on-time performance, and … we expect to drive further cost-savings.”

The deal comes amid a flurry of global aircraft ordering activity. Air India, IndiGo, Ryanair, and United Airlines have all unveiled 100-plus plane commitments since December. The orders, most of which do not include deliveries until the latter half of the decade, are both about growth and locking in delivery slots that are in short supply at Airbus and Boeing. Both airframers face supply chain challenges that are delaying deliveries of new aircraft.

Mexico has been a wunderkind of the Covid-19 recovery. It was among the first domestic markets to bounce back, and in the first quarter passenger numbers hit 29 million, or 17% larger than during the same period in 2019, according to data from the Latin American airlines trade group ALTA. The Mexican market also surpassed Brazil to take the top spot in the region during the period.

The strong recovery has been good for Mexico’s airlines. Volaris, the country’s largest airline, posted one of its most profitable years in 2021 when most airlines were still struggling under the pandemic’s toll. While its results last year were not as good, it remains bullish on the future. Aeromexico, which restructured under U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during the crisis, has come back strong. And the same is true for Viva Aerobus, which sits between Volaris and Aeromexico in terms of size in the Mexican market. Mexico also lost two airlines since 2020: Aeromar and Interjet.

Zuazua said in April that he was “positive” about the discounter’s opportunities, citing growth in the Mexican market and strong travel demand. His concerns were the same as most other airlines: aviation supply chain challenges and, unique to Mexico, the lack of clarity over when the U.S. could restore Mexico’s safety rating to category 1.

The upgrade in the safety rating, which is a measure of Mexico’s aviation regulator and not a statement on the safety of the country’s airlines, is key for Mexican carriers to fully take advantage of the boom in U.S.-Mexico air travel. Since the rating was downgraded to category 2 in 2021, no Mexican airline has been able to register additional aircraft in the U.S. or add new destinations to their maps, capping their growth. In addition, U.S. airlines had to stop codesharing on Mexican carriers’ flights, something that affected Aeromexico the most given its joint venture with Delta Air Lines.

Viva Aerobus’ proposed joint venture with Allegiant Air also hangs in limbo pending a restoration of category 1. While Mexico’s aviation regulator has approved the pact, the U.S. Department of Transportation cannot do the same until the safety rating returns to its highest level.

Aeromexico CEO Andres Conesa said at the end of June that he expected the U.S. to upgrade Mexico’s safety rating “next month,” or in July. That would allow his and other carriers to resume their U.S. growth by the end of the year.

With everyone eager to grow to the U.S., many expect a surge in new flights and routes once the upgrade occurs. Viva Aerobus will undoubtedly participate in that, especially if its joint venture with Allegiant is approved. Under the pact, the airline could add smaller U.S. destinations, like South Bend, Ind., or St. Louis’ Midamerica Airport with flights to Cancun and other beach destinations popular with American travelers."

A journey marked by growth, resilience and many successes

Since joining the Airbus Family in July 2018, the A220 has significantly spread its wings Over the past five years, this game-changing aircraft has more than doubled its order book and multiplied by more than five its number of operators worldwide.

The A220’s significant growth during the past years was made possible as the Programme’s industrial means were substantially strengthened. Optimised with the addition of a final assembly line at the Airbus site in Mobile, Alabama, U.S. in 2020 and a sub-assembly line at the Airbus A220 Programme’s headquarters in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada in 2022. These investments have allowed the A220’s production rate to accelerate, confirming that the Programme is on the right track to reach its maximum production capacity of 14 aircraft per month towards the middle of the decade.

The A220, the proven choice to connect today and tomorrow

Today, with more than 260 aircraft in service, the A220 fleet has travelled over one billion kilometres and connected more than 90 million passengers across the globe. Flying on more than 1,100 routes - ranging from 30 minutes to 8 hours, thanks to the aircraft’s high versatility - to over 375 destinations worldwide. This small but mighty bird offers 25% less fuel burn and CO 2 emissions compared with previous-generation aircraft.

The A220 also offers 50% lower NOx emissions than industry standards - and with an order book for around 800 aircraft, the flightpath ahead is a promising one.

Flying towards a bright future

Being part of the Airbus Family has certainly propelled the A220, an aircraft that plays an essential role in the company’s commitment to its decarbonization targets. The A220 is already capable of flying with a blend of up to 50% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and, like all other Airbus commercial aircraft, will be certified for 100% SAF capability by 2030.

The A220’s continued growth since July 2018 was made possible thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Airbus Teams around the world. Since its establishment in Quebec five years ago, Airbus has created more than 1,000 direct jobs in this canadian province and is looking to hire an additional 700 people in 2023 to work on the A220 Programme.

Airbus will continue to invest locally in research and development, collaborate with local partners and contribute to the sustainable growth of the aerospace industry. This includes the preparation of the next generation, where hundreds of thousands of dollars have been donated locally, namely in scholarships to institutions, and via a mentoring programme initiated by the Airbus Foundation.

The A220 has reached new heights since joining the Airbus Family in July 2018 and the Programme has certainly taken-off to a bright and promising journey.

"Up to 1,200 Geared Turbofan Airbus Jet Engines Recalled - Popular Mechanics","Thu, 27 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hNDQ2NTYyODUvMTIwMC1haXJidXMtamV0LWVuZ2luZXMtcmVjYWxsZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The RTX corporation revealed in an earnings call on July 25 that it was recalling up to 1,200 of its PW1100G Geared Turbofan Engines, built by subsidiary engine-maker Pratt & Whitney, for accelerated inspection.

The culprit—microscopic contaminants discovered in the powdered metal produced at a New York facility. The metal was used for engine’s stage 1 and 2 high-pressure turbine discs, manufactured at a factory in Columbus, Georgia between 2015 and 2021. The impurities expose the components to risk of accumulating micro-cracks in advance of their specified service lives.

The flaws were first detected in a broken disc on a Vietnamese A321ceo airliner using the older IAE V2500 turbofan—the product of a joint venture with Pratt & Whitney. However, in mid-July, Pratt & Whitney determined that they weren’t comfortable estimating the risk posed by the powdered metal to its latest-generation PW1100G engines, and that they merited an accelerated inspection schedule.

Related Story The World’s Largest Airplane Flies Again

At present, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon) plans to inspect 200 of the oldest higher-priority engines by September. An estimated 1,000 more engines may require inspection in the year to follow—though the final number could end up below or above that, depending in part on the findings of the initial tranche of inspections.

Two PW1100G-JM engines are used in some of Airbus’s A320neo and A321neo jetliners, which closely rival the Boeing 737 for the crown of most prolific jetliners in service. The estimated 1,200 engines amount to 40% of the roughly 3,000 PW-1100Gs delivered.

Each inspection requires two months to dismantle the engine, replace the discs (if flawed), and reassemble them. Based on prior experience looking for flawed discs in 3,000 engines, Pratt & Whitney is optimistic that only around 1% of the discs will require immediate replacement.

That recall (or ‘shortened inspection intervals’ as the firm put its) still risks disrupting operations by carriers that operates PW1100G-equipped jetliners, as in-service aircraft are taken out of rotation early for inspection. However, the discovered flaws don’t pertain to or affect deliveries of new GTF engines (the plant corrected them in 2021) or production of new aircraft.

RTX’s executive Greg Hayes conceded during the call that the “disappointing” problem would be expensive to fix and would impact customers—though he insisted that it didn’t amount to an “existential problem” for either Pratt & Whitney or RTX.

Nonetheless, investor backlash led to a 10% drop in RTX share value after the recalls were announced, while Airbus took a 2.5% hit. RTX itself reduced its estimated 2023 cash flow by a half billion dollars to a net $4.3 billion.

The A320’s most numerous operator is India’s IndiGo, with 143 aircraft. Other major operators that received A320neos and A321neos are found in the U.S. (Delta, Jet Blue, Spirit, United, Hawiian), China (including Air China, Shenzhen and Sichuan Airlines), Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, and Vietnam. America Airline’s large A320 and A321 fleet, however, uses the rival CFM LEAP engine for propulsion.

Clash of the turbofans: GTF versus LEAP

The two predominant jetliners in production today are the Boeing 737MAX and Airbus A320neo series of single-aisle airliners. While the 737MAX is fitted with the LEAP engine developed by market leader CFM International (a French-American joint venture), the A320neo can be fitted with either LEAP turbofans or the Geared Turbofan (GTF) developed by Pratt & Whitney.

GONZALO FUENTES // Getty Images LEAP-1A turbofan engines produced by joint venture CMF International at the Safran factory near Paris on June 16, 2023. The LEAP-1 is the main competitor of Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan (GTF) series of engines.

Both high-bypass turbofans were pegged as offering fuel efficiency improvements around 16%, which adds up to huge savings over older aircraft. Given that a typical jetliner might fly 3,000 hours annually, improving fuel efficiency and lowering operating costs are the name of the game in commercial jet travel. Carbon-emission reduction benchmarks and offsets seeking to slow down climate change further multiply the value of such efficiencies.

Though LEAP and GTF both incorporate many advanced technologies, such as new wear-resistant coatings, GTF is overall less conventional. They introduced a gearbox that allows the fan and the spool of the engine to turn at different, more optimal speeds.





GTF has its origins in research by Pratt & Whitney at NASA wind tunnel facilities that began in the 1990s. Pratt & Whitney began investing more seriously in the program in 2006, and had engine prototypes first flight tested by 2008. An A320neo-specific subvariant, the PW1100G, then took to the skies in 2013 and received FAA certification in December of 2014. This variant has a fan 2.05 meters in diameter, generates up to 17.5 tons of static thrust, and each one weighs 3.15 tons.

One early analysis estimated that GTF would exhibit lower operating costs due to having fewer components that would be exposed to less stress at lower temperatures—also making it preferable for airlines operating in hotter climates. GTF also is expected to reduce engine noise by up to 75%. On the downside, the gearbox does introduce some weight and complexity, though it doesn’t require any special lifetime maintenance other than periodic oil changes.

In practice, U.S. Department of Transportation figures from 2017-2020 show that the LEAP engines on A320neos require half as many repair and maintenance hours as the GTF, and have only half (or lower) the operating costs of the GTF, despite the GTF exhibiting lower fuel burn costs.

To be fair, these figures may reflect the identification and correction of teething issues that plagued the GFT engine family early on.

While many are partial to the PW1500G variant used on smaller Airbus A220-series airliners, the PW-1100Gs specific issues began with lengthy start times (7 minutes up from typical 2.5), attributed to asymmetric deformation of turbofan rotors due to thermal buildup. This was gradually addressed through modifications introduced between 2016 and 2017 in the form of revised fuel nozzles, inserted dampers, software upgrades, and a boron-nitride coating applied to rotor tips.

But, by 2018, engine vibrations emerged in PW1100Gs while climbing at high power, leading to Lufthansa grounding its A320nos for 8.5 months. Problems with a knife-edge seal used in the PW1100G’s compressor led Airbus to cease accepting deliveries of the engine until Pratt & Whitney replaced already delivered seals with a corrected design.

Indian carriers operating GTF turbofans in hot, heavily polluted environments experienced especially frequent problems that resulted in slow serviceability rates, with airline Go First even blaming the engines (both failure rate, and speed of replacement) for its bankruptcy. Pratt & Whitney argued that the airline’s mismanagement was to blame.

Related Story The F-14 Tomcat Was a Warfighter Without a War

At present, Aviation Week reports that 11% (over one out of ten) airliners using GTF-series engines were either grounded or being flown only once per week, often due to delays— either caused by waiting on reception of spare parts from Pratt Whitney, or by waiting for slots to free up for engine overhauls at 13 (going on 19) facilities worldwide that support GTF maintenance.

Pratt & Whitney says that it plans to create a surplus of spare parts to help circumvent these major delays.

The costs of quality control

The silver lining of the frustrations posed by the latest recall is the willingness of the company to take on the costs of preemptively identifying risks—even if they expect to find flaws in only 1% of all engine discs.



Time will tell whether the diverse issues exhibited by the GTF family of turbofans can be fully ironed out to achieve the desired improvements to reliability and reductions in operating costs."

Engines on some Airbus jets with Pratt & Whitney engines will need to be removed and inspected - The Associated Press,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3J0eC1yYXl0aGVvbi1haXJidXMtcHJhdHQtd2hpdG5leS1lbmdpbmVzLTY0MTVlYWUwN2Y5MTU4OTA1MGQ4MDdmN2IzY2I5NTMz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS (AP) — A large number of Airbus passenger jets will need to have their engines removed and inspected in the coming months after engine maker Pratt & Whitney discovered a problem that could cause parts to wear out more quickly, potentially adding to stress on airlines during the remainder of a hectic summer travel season.

Shares of Pratt & Whitney parent RTX Corp. fell 11% Tuesday afternoon after the company disclosed the issue.

RTX said that a “rare condition” in powder metal used to manufacture certain parts made between late 2015 and mid-2021 will require speeded-up fleet inspections. The engine involved is most often used to power the Airbus A320neo, a midsize jet popular for short and medium-distance flights.

The company said it expects that about 200 of Pratt PW1100 engines will need to be pulled off and inspected by mid-September, and another 1,000 engines will need inspections in the next nine to 12 months.

Many Airbus A320 family jets use engines from CFM, but nearly 800 A320 and A321s have the affected Pratt engines, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Indian low-cost airline IndiGo has nearly 140, Air China has 43, Germany’s Lufthansa has 37, and Mexico’s Volaris has 35.

Among U.S. carriers, Spirit Airlines received 34 of the planes, Hawaiian Airlines has 18 and JetBlue Airways 16, according to Cirium.

On a call with analysts, RTX Chief Operating Officer Christopher Calio said that the problem does not affect current production, and Pratt will continue to produce new engines and spare parts, but the life of parts made between late 2015 and mid-2021 could be reduced.

Pratt had planned to schedule “enhanced inspections” during normal maintenance stops, but based on recent discoveries, it decided that the inspections — focused on high-pressure turbine disks — needed to be speeded up, Calio said. He said the company is developing plans to conduct the inspections as quickly as possible.

The disclosure was made as RTX, formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, reported second-quarter earnings of $1.3 billion, up 2% from a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the profit came to $1.29 per share, beating the $1.18 consensus forecast of analysts.

Revenue rose 12% to $18.3 billion, topping analysts’ prediction of less than $17.7 billion, according to a FactSet survey. Pratt accounted for about one-third of sales."
"Canada orders more Airbus A330 tankers, hires firm to convert planes - Defense News","Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAyMy8wNy8yNS9jYW5hZGEtb3JkZXJzLW1vcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtdGFua2Vycy1oaXJlcy1maXJtLXRvLWNvbnZlcnQtcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VICTORIA, British Columbia — The Canadian government has increased the number of strategic tanker transport aircraft it is ordering from Airbus as it shores up its contribution to the defense of North America.

Last year, Canadian officials said they were committing to the purchase of four new A330 Multi Role Tanker Transports for its fleet, and negotiations were underway with Airbus. Meanwhile, the country acquired two used A330s from International Airfinance Corp., a global aircraft leasing company.

But on July 25, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand announced the government is buying three more used A330s from International Airfinance, and that it selected Airbus Defence and Space to convert the now-five used aircraft into strategic tankers.

Canada’s contract with Airbus, which covers delivery of the four new A330s and conversion of the five used aircraft, is worth about CA$3.6 billion (U.S. $2.7 billion). The used aircraft are currently configured for long-haul commercial use.

Anand noted that the initiative will allow the Royal Canadian Air Force to enhance its sovereignty operations, including in the Arctic. It will also strengthen Canada’s air-to-air refueling support for North American Aerospace Defense Command operations and NATO, she added.

“The additional air-to-air refueling initiative is an integral part of Canada’s investments in NORAD modernization,” Defence Department spokesman Dan LeBouthillier said.

Last year, the Canadian military found the Airbus A330 was the only aircraft that met its requirements. As a result, the nation issued a formal request for proposal for the planes to Airbus on May 13, 2022, and negotiations began.

The aircraft will be able to refuel current Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 fighter jets as well as the F-35 aircraft on order, Le Bouthillier said. The tankers will also be able to refuel various U.S. military aircraft.

The new planes are expected by 2027.

Canada is also buying a new simulator as part of the same program, but the government did not release further details.

“The A330 MRTT perfectly matches Canada’s needs to protect its sovereignty as well as to enhance operations both in the North American Aerospace Defence Command as well as in NATO,” Mike Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, said in a July 25 statement.

The new fleet will replace the existing CC-150 Polaris aircraft, which have been in operation since 1992.

Credit: Airbus.

Airbus recorded an 11% total revenue increase year on year to €27.7bn ($30.5bn) in the first half (H1) of 2023 compared to €24.8bn ($27.37bn) in H1 2022.

2023 demonstrates a period of high demand with gross commercial aircraft orders in H1 2023 totalling 1,080 in comparison to 442 aircraft in H1 2022.

Airbus delivered a total of 316 aircraft in H1, comprising 25 A220s, 256 A320s, 14 A330s and 21 A350s.

According to Airbus 2023 guidance, they have targets of 720 commercial aircraft deliveries, an EBIT adjusted of €6bn and a free cash flow before M&A and customer financing of €3bn.

The French aircraft manufacturer reported they hit a record-high backlog of 7,967 commercial aircraft at the end of June 2023, particularly due to finishing the Paris air show with orders for over 800 aircraft from across its range.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury emphasised the company’s progress across 2023, with an extended demand due to the success of the Paris Air Show: “During the first half of 2023, we progressed well across our businesses in an operational environment that remains complex.

“Our commercial aircraft are in strong demand, as demonstrated by more than 800 orders announced at the Paris Air Show. This demand is driven both by growth and fleet replacement as airlines invest in more fuel-efficient fleets, based on this H1 performance, we maintain our 2023 guidance.”

Ramping up production

According to Airbus, by the middle of the decade, the A220 programme has ramped up to a monthly manufacturing pace of 14 aircraft.

On the A320 family programme, the manufacturer continues to ramp up towards a monthly production rate of 65 aircraft by the end of 2024.

With the aim of increasing manufacturing possibilities for the A320, Airbus is set to open a second final assembly line at its Chinese plant in Tianjin before the end of 2025.

This will support plans to produce 75 aircraft per month in 2026.

Furthermore, the A321XLR’s flight test programme is ongoing and entry-into-service is anticipated for the second quarter (Q2) of 2024.

Will the targets be reached?

As previously reported, Airbus is still not on track to deliver 720 aircraft by the end of 2023, having already missed the 2022 goal.

Its EBIT adjusted, related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities, decreased to €580m compared to €1bn Q1 2022.

Airbus stated that reduced deliveries, a less attractive hedging rate compared to Q1 2022 and expenditures in planning for the future are all factors in the drop.

In light of this, Airbus helicopters’ EBIT adjusted increased to €156m (Q1 2022: €90m), which reflects the performance across programmes and the good start in services.

Lastly, consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was €-889m compared to €213m in Q1 2022, with the company stating this was primarily due to the inventory build-up required while the production ramp-up started."
Canada awards Airbus $2.7 billion tanker deal for 9 planes - Breaking Defense,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2NhbmFkYS1hd2FyZHMtYWlyYnVzLTItNy1iaWxsaW9uLXRhbmtlci1kZWFsLWZvci05LXBsYW5lcy_SAWRodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy9jYW5hZGEtYXdhcmRzLWFpcmJ1cy0yLTctYmlsbGlvbi10YW5rZXItZGVhbC1mb3ItOS1wbGFuZXMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Canada’s National Defence Department announced today that it has awarded a contract to Airbus for a total of nine aircraft to modernize its refueling fleet, a $3.6 billion CAN ($2.7 billion US) deal that should see delivery of the first jet to the country within months.

“As autocratic regimes threaten the rules-based international order, there is a pressing need to modernize the capabilities of the Royal Canadian Air Force in support of North Atlantic Treaty Organization and North American Aerospace Defense Command operations,” Canadian Minister of National Defence Anita Anand said in a statement.

“The Strategic Tanker Transport Capability brought forward today with the contract award for renewed air-to-air refueling, strategic transport and aeromedical evacuation capabilities, will deliver modern equipment for our Canadian Armed Forces, who put their lives on the line every single day to defend our shared continent with the US, and support our allies in time of need,” she added.

The contract covers the new build of four A330 MRTTs and the military conversion of five used A330-200 aircraft, a decision the Canadian government said saved the country’s taxpayers millions.

Four of the used aircraft are set to be used as refuelers, while the fifth — the first destined for delivery later this summer — will initially transport high-ranking government officials and could take on the tanker mission later. The second used aircraft is expected in the fall, with the next three to follow next year, according to a summary compiled by Canada’s Defence Department.

An Airbus press release further stated the first of the newly-built tankers will be delivered in 2027 and that all MRTTs will feature both a hose and drogue and boom for refueling.



The tankers will replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CC-150 Polaris fleet to provide refueling, cargo and passenger transport and aeromedical evacuation. While Canada operates five CC-150s, only two of them are capable of refueling. That means the NATO member’s mid-air refueling capacity is about to quadruple with the new agreement.

Canada had previously considered Boeing’s KC-46 for the role but reportedly dropped the company’s tanker from consideration in 2021, subsequently issuing a request for proposals to Airbus in May 2022. The country’s forthcoming tankers will be designated the CC-330 Husky.

Airbus is currently pitching the A330 MRTT in partnership with Lockheed Martin to the US Air Force as the LMXT, though officials have stated they are leaning toward more purchases of Boeing’s KC-46A to continue recapitalizing America’s current KC-135 Stratotanker tanker fleet."

Rush Transcript:

Lee Ann: Welcome to Aviation Week's MRO Podcast.

In this episode, we'll be talking about the world's largest passenger aircraft, the iconic Airbus A380 program, and the present and future of its fleet and aftermarket.

I'm Lee Ann Shay, Aviation Week's Executive Editor for MRO and Business Aviation. And I'm here with my colleagues James Pozzi and Dan Williams. James is our MRO Editor for EMEA, and Dan is our Senior Manager of Fleet, Flight and Forecast Data. That's a bit of a tongue twister.

Welcome, James and Dan.

James: Hi, Lee Ann. Good to be here.

Dan: Yes, thanks for having us today.

Lee Ann: You bet.

Let's start out with a scene setter. Airbus stopped producing the A380 in 2021. Dan, would you please describe the current A380 fleet?

Dan: Yes, the A380 has gone on a bit of a journey. Obviously, let's go back a little bit, pre-pandemic. The writing was on the wall almost before they even delivered the very first one with step change in engine technology that Boeing held a nerve and went for the twin jet and bus plowed on with a double Decker four engined behemoth. Then, we fast-forward a little bit towards just before the pandemic, and there was about 240, give or take a handful, A380s in service. And then, as the pandemic hit, I think a lot of people, and to a certain extent myself, thought the days of the A380 were numbered, even though they were still delivering technically A380s right to the very end. They've been on an interesting journey.

Where we stand today, we went from the 214 service pre-pandemic and we're back to about 160 in service where we are today. And that alone tells us about 68%, nearly two thirds of the fleet, are back, which is great considering during the course of the pandemic there were certain CEOs of Middle Eastern carriers that said they were never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever going to bring the A380 back into service and, hey presto, it's back into service because I don't think anybody could have foreseen the labor shortages, the issues with new deliveries, the supply chain issues. And this lots of little things individually have created a big problem and, all of a sudden, the A380 looks great again.

Let's add on top of that` the slot constrained airports. BA always loved the A380 because it's one flight, it's one slot and it's a lot of passengers. And then, we've seen the announcement, for example, of Amsterdam where they're going to slot-restrain the airport. How do you get around that? You put bigger aircraft into it, so the A380s had a slight resurgence.

It's not all good news because, during the course of the pandemic, quite a few of them were parted out and scrapped. Air France, a couple were gone and Singapore and the like. It's not a perfect story but it's got a slight silver lining to the story. And in terms of utilization where we are today, they're still at about 60% of equivalent month 2019.

Again, their fleet is at about 66% of pre-pandemic. They're flying at about 66% of pre-pandemic. They're never going to get to pre-pandemic levels purely because they're not the aircraft available. It's not all a bad news story as we thought it was this time three years ago, just after we'd gone into the pandemic. However, it's not the best news story but it's a reasonably good news story.

Lee Ann: Those are some really excellent points and I agree with you. When the pandemic started, there's no way I would've said that 66% of the A380 fleet would be flying today. I was off on that one.

James, given that 66% of the A380 fleet is still flying, let's talk about the aftermarket. What are you seeing?

James: Yes, look at what Dan said. It's been a journey and certainly for the program over the last few years, and I guess really since the beginning of its life it's had many twists and turns really. If you'd asked me this question anytime from between 2019 when production was first announced to stop through to 2021 when it actually happened, I would've likely told you that the A380 aftermarket would descend in line with what we thought would be significantly reduced fleet size over the next decade. Also, of course, I can't talk about this without throwing in COVID. I would've doubled down on that opinion during COVID when it seemed that the end of the program would be sped up rapidly when we saw airlines, some of which Dan mentioned, either announce or actively start offloading their A380 eighties, of course due to the collapse in long haul travel demand and the fleet reductions that took place.

However, as it stands, the A380 is indeed having a bit of a comeback as more aircraft reentered the global fleet and some of its operators are reversing previous decisions to keep aircraft in long-term storage or retire them altogether. I'm thinking about the likes of Lufthansa had U-turn on that, Etihad are bringing back some of their A380s now, they obviously just announced that recently one aircraft reentered service after some maintenance checks took place in Abu Dhabi.

Yes, I would say the aftermarket looks pretty steady really, despite being obviously smaller than other major wide-body fleets given the lower volumes of aircraft worldwide. But I think it should show some signs of longevity over the next decade. And the recent spike in travel demands, as I mentioned, leading to the likes of Lufthansa, Etihads, and of course Emirates reactivating A380 aircraft after long-term storage, that can't hurt at all.

Over the next 10 years, based on some of the... I don't want to, obviously, steal Dan's thunder because I know he'll be talking about some of the data later on, I imagine. But yes, over the next 10 years I think the overall market is projected at 23.5 billion in MRO spending. And that's not insignificant, although there are relatively few A380 maintenance providers and of course they're all centered around the regions such as Middle East, Europe, Asia Pacific, and to a lesser extent there's a few obviously in China as well. And obviously later on, we'll be able to look at some of the market segments and see exactly where some of this maintenance will take place. But one of the really interesting ones, which I'll expand on a bit later, is in modifications. It seems to be quite a buoyant market around that in the next few years, and there's certainly reasons for that with various retrofit projects set to take place.

Of course, we can't really talk about any program at the moment without mentioning the supply chain. It's very interesting that Qantas stated early this year that a lack of slot availability for maintenance delayed the return to service of the six A380s it planned to bring back into the fleet. That's something to watch because of course, as Dan mentioned, there's around 160 aircraft in service at present, and this number will grow next year. I think there's a bit of a spike for leveling out after that, as more aircraft return to service. But of course, supply of parts and maintenance slots availability, they'll be, of course it goes without saying, will be really important.

For parts, we've seen the A380 become a reasonably attractive teardown option in recent years, following on from that retirement spike in 2020 that we saw. I think around 11 aircraft were retired that year according to Aviation Week's data. Although the wide-body segment hasn't been as impacted as the narrow-body segments by constraints of USM, that doesn't mean that's not happening and there will always be demand for more USM in the market and the A380 is certainly no different to that.

This year of course, we've seen fund investors in the A380. Dr. Peters who are of course based in Germany, in Dortmund, before COVID, they were looking to recoup on their investments with aircraft taken off lease, were selling them to head down specialists to take part and sell the parts of the A380, which I've always been fascinated by the fact they number more than a million parts, which is a huge, huge amount of course. But not surprisingly, really, for such a big aircraft. It'd be interesting to see what we see there in terms of the teardowns going on. A lot to think about there.

And of course recently our colleagues Jens Flottau and Sean Broderick reported on the issues around the A380s that sat idle in severe environmental conditions, being susceptible to wing-spar cracking, which is clearly linked to the wing's age. And as I said, Sean and Jens have done a lot of reporting on this.

As it stands, it seems that obviously EASA have adopted a broader inspection criteria which is recommended of course by Airbus, the manufacturer. And Airbus since then said that this will not change its storage guidance of the aircraft and the airlines impacted by that, one of which is Emirates, is being supported by them to overcome these issues.

As I said, that was quite a significant story report on a few months to go, and that could be interesting too. As I said, it seems Airbus have that under control but, as more of these aircraft returns of service, that could just be want to watch and want to keep an eye on. And that's sure to... Hopefully won't, but it could obviously cause a few headaches to operators and of course the manufacturers. Yes, that could be something to keep an eye on, I think, as more return to service maybe.

Lee Ann: Thank you, James. You just covered a lot. $23 billion, 160 aircraft, a million parts, wings, lots to follow up on there.

But Dan, since you are the manager of Fleet, Flight and Forecast, I think I just like saying those three words, are you seeing any interesting data sets related to the A380 aftermarket?

Dan: Yes. The A380, just in general, is fascinating. The issue that the A380 has is it doesn't really have a secondary market. I think this is the biggest problem of it all. Hi Fly tried it with a couple of A380s that they took and they are now USM. We have seen announcement by a company called Global who are taking some secondhand A380s. I don't know how successful they may be. I wish them well. I think they will probably find it quite tricky and quite difficult to fill those aircraft because the traditional carriers have.

In terms of the aftermarket MRO, let's be realistic about this. A380s are D-checked at 12 and 24. We're currently in the midst of our forecasting process now for our next forecast release. The chance of an A380 lasting higher than the age of 24 is somewhere between slim and nul. We are looking, over the course probably about our next 10-year forecast, the vast majority of A380s will slowly dwindle out of service purely because they get to old. Qatar have already said that, ""Yes, we're never bringing them back. But then we'll bring them back,"" but they'll only bring them back until they get the A350-1000.

There's going to come a point, in the not to just in future, where those are going to come out and, again, I doubt they will find the secondhand market. They are well-used aircraft in what is deemed, from an MRO perspective, quite a harsh environment for them to operate in, at least every other flight.

The MRO is, whilst there's a huge number, don't get me wrong, it really is, we are looking at a number that is slowly going to be dwindling in because these A380s, like Emirates they built the backbone of their fleets on these, they're going to need replacement aircraft in the future. And the natural replacement ironically for the A380 is the Boeing 777X, similar passenger capacity, it does everything almost an A380 can do just with two engines rather than four. And when that enters service later in the decade, you can pick a number because I don't think Boeing can pick a number for a [inaudible 00:11:50] to service right now.

You will see some of that fleet replacement, and those traditional carriers who have had the A380 are the same carriers who have ordered the 777X. The MRO is still a huge number. Like James said before, there are only limited MRO people that can do it, companies that can do it because they are a specialist vehicle. It's tricky for Qantas to get a slot because, A, not many companies do it, B, it's one heck of an aircraft to try and get in. And they need a big slot to fit it in because it's down a long time and they need a big space to be able to do it.

There is some good news in this because, go back three years ago, and people were [inaudible 00:12:29] to a reasonable extent, other than Emirates who is going to operate the A380 again. And the nice thing is it's not just Emirates that are operating them right now.

Lee Ann: Thank you.

Really, the next decade is going to be the decade of A380 maintenance.

Dan: Yes. And come 2030s, that's probably the time that those MRO companies need to start looking at other platforms to service as their A380 replacement, just like the operators are looking for A380 replacements for the passengers.

Lee Ann: I guess for aftermarket providers who are doing the A380, you should maybe consider getting into the 777X, it sounds like, in a decade or so.

Speaking of market opportunities for MRO providers, James, are there particular market segments such as interior refurbishments?

James: Yes, I'll start with that.

As I said, there's some interesting things going on at the moment. I'll just start with saying, you mentioned looking at other aircraft types and I don't see a great need or will really for MRO providers that don't have A380 capabilities to add new capabilities in the area, particularly in engine overhaul and base maintenance, while things like C checks will take up a lot of the airframe MRO activity. I just don't think they have the will or logic or business sense to do that for MROs. And I think those providers that have existing capabilities would hope to service that because, as I said before, that's around Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and of course China to some extent as well now.

But I'll start with the modifications. Yes, it's a very interesting thing that's going on at the moment. Emirates, I think it's fair to say, are carrying this program and have done so because they comfortably have the largest fleet share in the A380 global fleet. And of course, they're undertaking a big retrofit program announced obviously last year, and it's numbering 120 aircraft in total and 67 of those are A380s with the remainders 777s. And this will target the retrofitting of everything from first class to business class areas, and looking at everything from seats, carpets, et cetera, taken out and replaced and modified. And yes, despite plans to reduce its A380 fleet overtime, Emirates of course still will have them in for, I think, maybe the longest or certainly among the longest of any of the airlines. I think their original plans were going all the way through to 2035 when they envisaged having them in their fleet.

Yes, this will continue for the next couple of years and that will provide, I think, a spike in the retrofit work over the next two years. Obviously, I've seen other airlines. Obviously, the Singapore, obviously the launch customer for the program back in 2007, they've retrofitted their older a three eighties with new, first and business class cabins. I wouldn't be surprised if the other carriers follow suit and embark on retrofit programs of this kind, especially if the demand is back and obviously the advantages we talked about of the A380. And there are still plenty of those. If they see it as certainly a mid to long-term prospect, throughout the rest of this decade, the 2020s, then certainly could see maybe more of that modification work taking place. As I mentioned before, yes, C checks will play a large part in this. And I know for the A380 they occur every 36 months and that was changed in 2017, that was revised. And I think, according to Aviation Week data, they're going to peak by next year. And of course a large share of that will be driven by Emirates.

We've seen a bit of activity risk maybe with contracts. Lufthansa Technik earlier this year taking on some contracts for the A380 related to C checks and landing gear overhaul. British Airways of course outsourced their base maintenance for all 12 of their A380s to look down to Lufthansa Technik Philippines business a year or two back. Companies are planning ahead for that and getting their contracts in place for the next five years or so, for the base maintenance.

Yes, I do agree with Dan who covered the heavy maintenance. It obviously only accounts for a very... Sorry, a D check. That accounts for a very small part of the predicted MRO events. However, given the time spans of when they take place, it's very unlikely that some of them will have a [inaudible 00:16:35] base I think in the 24 and the 36 numbers.

But I think overall there's plenty of activities and certainly the specialists already in the A380 space can... Provided the capacities there and the readiness for this reintroduction of some of these aircraft, there is certainly I'd say healthy MRO opportunities ahead for the next decade or so. And as I said, that's the established players already in the space.

And just one more thing. I mentioned about capabilities before. Possibly, the only thing we might see a bit of, and we've seen it with a couple of companies in the last year, smaller independent MROs, they've added CAMO approvals related to the A380. This is of course when a company oversees the scheduling and control of continuing airworthiness activities on the aircraft and their part. There could be demand of that as well as of course line maintenance, as flying picks up. Of course that's dependent on certain factors. I can't really think, off the top of my head, of any company that have really added line maintenance capabilities for the A380 in the last couple of years, in recent times. But certainly there are providers out there who will do that. They may see a bit of opportunity there to pick up some of that work, in the coming years.

Lee Ann: Lots of opportunities for the A380. We should not be writing off this iconic aircraft. And I was just thinking of when these iconic aircraft like the 747-400, made their last flights and were retired, just the fanfare around the world. I can only expect, when the A380 does make its last flights, how the world will be reacting.

Dan and James, thanks for your great insights and data. Really appreciate it.

Intelsat and Panasonic benefit as Airbus expands HBCplus - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvaW50ZWxzYXQtcGFuYXNvbmljLWFpcmJ1cy1oYmNwbHVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Airbus launched its Airspace Link HBCplus linefit supplier-furnished inflight connectivity programme in 2022, naming Inmarsat (now Viasat) and later SES as managed service providers (MSPs) on the Ka-band satellite side of the program, the airframer assured it would flesh out Ku-band IFC options for airline customers in time.

During last month’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Airbus made good on its promise, naming Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics as Ku-band MSPs under memorandums of understanding with each firm, and tapping Safran Passenger Innovations to provide the terminal using an electronically steered antenna (ESA).

“HBCplus will enable these MSPs with GEO constellations to seamlessly integrate their chosen LEO operators, such as OneWeb, into their Ku service for their respective airline customers — using the same electronically steered antenna (ESA),” Airbus said at the time.

Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics welcome inclusion in this Airbus supplier furnished equipment (SFE) programme. Being part of HBCplus is “great news”, says Intelsat SVP, commercial Dave Bijur, “and I think that it opens up a whole set of new possibilities for airlines. And in my view, HBCplus is going to create a simple way for airlines to get product on board.”

After all, he notes, IFC has been confusing for many airlines. Some solutions, including Intelsat 2Ku for instance, are offered today as buyer furnished equipment as part of the airframers’ respective catalogues; some are equipped via service bulletin (accommodating the unique requirements of the Boeing 787, for example), and of course a variety of options are available on the retrofit market and can be installed on aircraft when supplemental type certification is secured.

“Well, Airbus simplifies it with HBCplus,” says Bijur, of the programme, which sees Airbus not only factory-fit the IFC hardware to A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, but assume overall responsibility to airline customers. “And I think for certain airlines that’s going to be a great outcome. And others, I think, will stick with something that exists in the market today.”

Panasonic Avionics is also enthused. “Airbus and HBCplus has been a while in the works in terms of how they are looking to simplify the installation on the aircraft. We are very much a supporter of that,” says John Wade, vice president, connectivity business unit.

“We understand why the airlines want to do that. And the terminal that Airbus is moving towards finalizing with Safran, we think is a great solution for multi-orbit. We are really excited about where they are going to take that. Hence that is why we are signing with Airbus for Airbus linefit.”

Safran confirms to RGN it is using the Get SAT Lesa Blade Ku Air antenna as part of the terminal it will provide to Airbus for HBCplus Ku-band connectivity. In contrast, Safran selected ThinKom Solutions’ Ka2517 VICTS antenna for the Ka-band side of the programme (Emirates and Ethiopian Airlines are launch customers). The terminals will come as SFE linefit catalogue options and also be offered for retrofit across Airbus types.

The news that Safran has selected Get SAT’s hardware is a blow to Dallas-based Stellar Blu Solutions, whose multi-orbit electronically steered antenna package, inclusive of Ball Aerospace’s scalable subarrays, is favored by OneWeb distribution partners Intelsat and Panasonic (and indeed OneWeb), and which is separately making some meaningful linefit gains at Boeing, starting with linefit provisions.

“Our current partner is Stellar Blu in the retrofit market. We are excited about what that terminal does,” says Panasonic’s Wade. At the same time, Panasonic is also staying flexible, and is willing to integrate with third-party hardware. “And where we see technology that’s available, capable and ready to go to market, and affordable, then we’re going to be very willing to embrace that. So any terminal providers out there who want to come talk to Panasonic, please do,” says Wade.

But today, he adds, “you can rely on us supporting Stellar Blu and the Airbus/Safran” terminals. The Stellar Blu terminal will be in production next year, he says, “and I think the Airbus terminal [for Ku] will be a close follow to that”.

Intelsat’s Bijur, meanwhile, is also unperturbed that Safran is pursuing another direction for the antenna hardware. “[H]ere’s what I care about, that the thing works and is good. And there’s a lot of ways to define good, but you know airlines are going to want it to stay on the airplane. If they wind up acquiring an antenna directly from Airbus … it’s on Airbus to make sure that works. I don’t need to worry about that. And why do I honestly, at the end of the day, care? I don’t. So, it’s perfectly okay if the antenna comes from somewhere else”, as long as it works, “and as long as the party that is responsible for making it work is held responsible for its function.”

What Is It Like to Fly on United's Upgraded Airbus A319? - Business Traveler USA,"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vdHJpZWQtdGVzdGVkL3VuaXRlZC1uZXh0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5LXJldmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June 2021, United Airlines made waves in the aviation industry with its announcement of acquiring a significant number of brand-new Airbus and Boeing narrowbody aircraft. These planes were set to feature seatback entertainment systems.

United embarked on an ambitious project to retrofit its entire mainline fleet with new cabins that boasted larger overhead bins, LED lighting, and comprehensive seatback entertainment within five years. This program, aptly named United NEXT, promised to elevate the passenger experience.

While United had taken delivery of numerous Boeing 737 MAX planes with these cutting-edge cabins over the past two years, no aircraft in its existing fleet had yet undergone the retrofit process due to supply chain challenges.

However, a notable milestone occurred when N801UA, a 26-year-old Airbus A319, returned to service in May after spending several months as the prototype for United’s new cabin. This signaled the commencement of the extensive retrofit initiative, which would revolutionize United’s passenger experience. The airline wasted no time implementing these retrofits, with three Airbus A319s and one A320 (as of July 2023) currently flying with the new cabin.

Residing in the Mexican city of Leon, Guanajuato, I frequently travel the BJX-IAH route operated by United’s Airbus A319 fleet. It was a pleasant surprise when I checked the United app a day before my flight and discovered that N801UA—one of the newly retrofitted aircraft—had been assigned to operate my journey, giving me the unique opportunity to experience firsthand the future of United’s Airbus fleet.

Check-In

Ten days after booking my flight, I received a delightful surprise in the form of a text message notifying me of an upgrade. As a Premier 1K member on United, this perk was made possible. To my satisfaction, I was automatically assigned seat 3F, which I typically prefer due to its window location in the last row, offering a better view of the aircraft’s wings.

Utilizing the United app, I swiftly checked in for my international flight, a process that took a mere 3-4 minutes as the system verified my passport information and issued my boarding pass. Thanks to this seamless check-in experience, I bypassed the traditional check-in counter upon my arrival at Houston.

Boarding and Cabin

Arriving at the gate 45 minutes before departure, just 10 minutes prior to the published boarding time, I observed the pre-boarding procedure. Beginning at T-40, customers with disabilities, Active Duty personnel, United’s invite-only Global Service members, families with infants aged two and under, and finally United’s Premier 1K customers were called for pre-boarding.

As a Premier 1K customer, I approached the podium with passport in hand, only to be informed that it was unnecessary as United would be utilizing biometric scanners. A quick glance at the camera granted me access to board without presenting my boarding pass or passport—a neat and efficient process.

Stepping onto the aircraft, I immediately noticed the transformed atmosphere. Bathed in a deep purple hue, the cabin radiated a modern vibe. The first thing the flight attendant noticed was my excitement in capturing photos, as it was also her inaugural experience working on the NEXT Airbus.

In addition to the captivating mood lighting, I was impressed by the expansive overhead bins, reminiscent of those found on the 737 MAX. United effectively communicates the increased bin capacity through text messages and signage.

The introduction of seatback screens on the Airbus fleet caught my attention as well. Available at every seat throughout the cabin, these new additions also offered Bluetooth audio capabilities—an exciting upgrade. These modern features made the 26-year-old A319 feel like a brand-new aircraft, aligned with United’s latest fleet offerings.

The Seat

United seized the opportunity to unveil a fresh First Class seat design on the Airbus fleet, tailored to align with the airline’s brand standards. The seats were a modified version of their older First Class seats, which were introduced in 2015. Enhancements included a hard shell seatback with privacy wings, reminiscent (albeit smaller) of those found on Delta’s A321neo. Additionally, the seats boasted a new cradle recline and improved padding.

Upon settling into seat 3F, I immediately noticed the enhanced padding, which provided a noticeably more cushioned experience compared to the previous-generation seats on the 737 MAX. The screen size impressed me, measuring an impressive 13 inches. The seat layout remained similar to previous versions, with an in-flight entertainment (IFE) remote available at each seat, as well as individual USB-C and power outlets.

Conveniently, the armrests featured three separate storage compartments, allowing for easy organization of personal belongings during the flight. I opted to store my cables in one of these compartments for better organization. Additionally, a retractable drink tray was available in the central armrest.

The Flight

With the introduction of seatback screens, the traditional manual safety demonstrations were replaced with United’s “Safety is Global” video, which was broadcasted throughout the cabin. Following the video, the cabin was bathed in a calming deep blue mood lighting, maintaining this ambiance for the duration of the flight.

United offers my favorite in-flight entertainment system within North America, and as a frequent traveler with the airline, I have had ample time to explore its offerings. The extensive selection of movies includes a wide range of genres, with monthly updates introducing new releases and timeless classics.

In terms of TV options, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that many shows offered at least half a season’s worth of episodes. However, I was disappointed by the absence of live TV, a feature available on a significant portion of United’s 737 NG fleet.

Aviation enthusiasts like myself will appreciate the return of “Channel 9,” now officially known as “From the Flight Deck.” This audio channel allows passengers to listen in on air traffic control (ATC) communications. While I cannot confirm whether this feature is fully functional on the retrofitted aircraft, its reintroduction is a welcomed addition.

The entertainment system itself is intuitive, allowing for quick glances at the flight map without pausing the current selection. It also provides the option to minimize the current selection to browse other sections, as well as automatically play the next episode in a series or suggest movies with similar themes and shorter durations than the remaining flight time.

Flight attendants kindly offered complimentary wired earbuds to those in need, although this should not be necessary for passengers with Bluetooth headphones. The Bluetooth pairing process on the Airbus fleet appeared to be significantly improved compared to the beta version on the 737 MAX, with faster connection and improved volume capabilities.

In the past, I experienced mid-flight Wi-Fi disruptions on United’s flights to Mexico. However, I am pleased to report that a stable Wi-Fi signal was available throughout the entire flight, priced at a flat fee of $8 for United MileagePlus members, $10 for non-members, and complimentary for select T-Mobile plan holders.

It is worth noting that unlike the MAX fleet, these retrofitted aircraft were not equipped with high-speed Wi-Fi, which may result in occasional restrictions in signal strength.

Meal Service

United’s policy stipulates that meals are provided on flights covering a distance of 800 miles or more. Unfortunately, the Houston to Leon route falls slightly short at a distance of 728 miles, as indicated by the United app: “Meals are not offered for this flight.”

However, shortly after navigating through a few bouts of turbulence during ascent, the attentive flight attendant sprang into action, offering a round of drinks followed by a snack basket containing six different options. Opting for a coffee, a pack of almonds, and an “immune citrus burst” beverage, I found the offerings satisfying.

Throughout the flight, the flight attendant regularly traversed the aisle every 10-15 minutes, ensuring refills were offered and attending to passengers who were asleep. After ensuring all passengers had the opportunity to explore the snack basket, she made a second round, but by that time, the basket was nearly depleted.

Verdict

My experience onboard United’s retrofitted Airbus A319 was truly elevated and exceeded my expectations. The airline’s United NEXT initiative to retrofit its entire mainline fleet with upgraded cabins and seatback entertainment systems has brought about a significant transformation in the passenger experience.

From the seamless check-in process to the efficient and biometric-based boarding procedure, United’s attention to detail and modernization efforts were evident. The introduction of seatback screens with Bluetooth audio capabilities was a standout feature, making the 26-year-old A319 feel like a brand-new aircraft. The enhanced padding and 13-inch screen size in the first-class seats provided a comfortable and immersive experience."

What is your current role and where are you based? I’m in charge of a topic which is key for our business: safety and risk management. I also cover quality management, part-145 training management and provider quality management. I am currently leading the Quality workstream in our new Airbus Lifecycle Services (ALS) joint venture* in Chengdu, China, where I will be the Head of Quality & Safety there. I’m working with the industrial workstream based in Toulouse, France to set the quality deliverables during the project phase and beyond in our daily operations. *Joint venture between Airbus, TARMAC Aerosave and Chengdu Airport Industrial Xingcheng Investment Development

What’s special about this new joint venture? The ALS (Aircraft Lifecycle Service) is the first aircraft lifecycle service centre in China, and will cover a range of activities from aircraft parking and storage, maintenance, upgrades, conversions, dismantling and recycling services for various aircraft types. With sustainability being part of the Airbus purpose and strategy, I’m especially proud to be part of this activity. Currently the site is under construction, where we are focusing on preparing entry-into-service setup for the A320 Family aircraft, then plan to extend capability to the A330 Family aircraft.

My first day in Airbus made me feel I was really a part of our big Airbus family.

What’s been your career path so far? I studied Aviation Mechanical and Electrical Maintenance in Xi’an, and gained a wealth of experience working successively as a Mechanic, Technician, Library officer, Assistant of Engineering Manager, Auditor, Buyer, Purchasing Manager, Vice-Manager of MRO in Xi’an. I have also worked abroad in Poland as a Project Manager for 2 years, and then worked as an EASA Deputy Quality Manager in a joint venture between SAFRAN and China Eastern Airlines, and now I’m lucky to be part of the Airbus family.

What attracted you to Airbus? I heard about the PAMELA (Process for Advanced Management of End-of-Life Aircraft) Project many years ago. Then early in 2022 I read in the news that Airbus planned to open an Aircraft Lifecycle Service Centre in Chengdu. I was very excited and inspired by the strategic decision of Airbus to work with TARMAC, specialising in aircraft dismantling, and further contribute to society's sustainability target. I hoped I could be part of the new history. After several interviews by China and France project teams, I successfully got the offer and since then I have been working on the Quality workstream of this project. The most impressive Airbus value I feel is the We are one

What do you enjoy the most about your job? There are many aspects that I enjoy. I have the chance to work with experts in the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) field all over the world to exchange ideas and work towards a common target. I also appreciate the online training platform that Airbus employees can access to learn and upskill at any time. I’m in charge of the process for daily operations which must be submitted to the authorities (CAAC Civil Aviation Administration of China and EASA) for approval. This is an energising experience for me.

Tell us about a memorable experience at Airbus. What made it so unforgettable? That was my first day in Airbus which made me feel I was really a part of the Airbus family. As a newcomer, the first day is always very difficult. Everything is fresh, everyone is new and you need to get used to a new world. But the team gave me a lot of support. They helped me with practical things such as access, my laptop, the campus shuttle, how to use Airbus tools….. And they introduced me to each team on the Beijing campus and organised a memorable lunch! Both my work and personal life are well prepared thanks to them.

How do the Airbus values relate to your own? The most impressive Airbus value I feel is the “We are one”, as I interact with different functions in Airbus including Quality, EHS (Environment, Health and Safety), Business Development, Procurement, Finance and HR. Whenever I reach out to colleagues, wherever they are in the world, I always get their support efficiently. In my experience in Airbus, I can feel that people are living the teamwork value! And I really feel that I am a member of a global team.

And outside of work, how do you enjoy spending your free time? I like collecting stamps, coins, and travelling in my spare time to explore different places and cultures. I see this “personal time” as a recharging process for a work-life balance.

When Joseph Berault was growing up and his family would go on vacation, he liked riding on planes and watching them take off and land almost as much as the trip.

So when other students at McGill-Toolen Catholic High School in Mobile, Alabama, started talking last summer about Flight Path 9, a new afterschool and summer program that teaches high school students early skills to build airplanes, Joseph was hooked.

A partnership between Bishop State Community College and airplane manufacturer Airbus, Flight Path 9 is a fledgling pre-apprentice program designed to put high schoolers on a path to careers at Airbus’ only U.S. airplane assembly plant located right in their backyard.

Berault and more than 40 other just-graduated high school seniors from across the Mobile area attended classes at Bishop State from 4 to 8 p.m. two nights a week this past school year.

This summer, they pack a workshop floor at Bishop State for 32 hours a week to learn manufacturing skills like riveting, precision cutting and using multimeters.

In August, most will become full apprentices at the Airbus Final Assembly Line, where they will be paid real salaries while they continue to learn and work on the A220 airliners used by Delta, Air Canada and Air France.

“Some students say, when you’re going into this two days every week, ‘I just don’t want to do that,’ because it’s taking up their senior year,” said Berault, who graduated this spring. “But I think it was completely worth it.”

“I feel like I feel like I didn’t know much of anything when I came into this program, but the amount I’ve learned in the past couple months is just insane.”

Fellow trainee Nicole Olivares, whose parents both work for Airbus, was also excited for a chance to work in aviation. She urged students to join the program, even with the classes two nights a week.

“I think it’s so worth it,” she said. “You can still do other things. You have a life outside of Flightworks.”

Based in France, Airbus is one of the two largest airliner manufacturers in the world. It’s also very used to training new employees at a young age. As is typical in Europe, its plants there start students as full-time apprentices at around age 15 or the equivalent of junior year of high school here.

But that’s part of the culture in Europe, where general high school education typically ends after 10th grade and students must shift into either a career skills or an intense university academic path. With the United States locked into its 12-year system of students working toward a general high school diploma, Airbus can’t just bring its European model here and start apprentices at 15. Students still have to finish high school.

But company officials knew even as they opened the Mobile plant in 2015 that they needed a pipeline for high school students to train to work there. Michelle Hurdle, director of workforce and economic development of Airbus Americas Inc., started visiting other Airbus facilities and began working with schools, community groups and Bishop State to create a curriculum and program that launched in 2019. After a hiatus because of the pandemic, the program re-started in fall of 2022.

“We want our facility to reflect our community,” Hurdle said. “So what better way to do that than to recruit and train and grow from within because that’s what creates loyalty.”

Students in the program earn a certificate in Aviation Manufacturing Technology from Bishop State, several industry certifications for working with things like blueprints, sheet metal and multimeters and they also leave with 18 credit hours that can go toward an aviation manufacturing associates degree when Bishop launches that degree program in fall of 2024.

Having credentials that matter to most manufacturers, not just for Airbus, was important from the start, said Hurdle and Akareem Spears, dean of workforce and economic development at Bishop State,

“Just say 5-10 years from now, they don’t want to work at Airbus, they still have these credentials that they can take with them,” Spears said. “These individuals have something that are tangible that they can carry with them.”

During the school year, Bishop State instructors and others from a nonprofit created by Airbus teach the evening classes. Students are not paid for that time, but are given dinner at the school.

“No mama wants to cook at 8:30 when your children come home,” Hurdle said.

In the summer, students are paid a $40 per day stipend as they take classes for five weeks. Airbus declined to say what apprentices are paid during the 14-month apprenticeship. As apprentices, they are monitored and have their work checked by full employees and only work independently after completing the apprenticeship.

Airbus and the college want to go even further with Flight 9 over time.

“Hopefully, we can start younger, and start getting into middle schools, and maybe by elementary school,” Spears said. “We can introduce multimeters, and all those kind of things early on, and we built an ecosystem.”

Berault said he may go back to school some day to earn the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airframe and Powerplant license or to be an engineer. For now, though, he is anxious to start as an apprentice.

“I love the work.” he said. “I love being busy. I just like having stuff to do with my hands, like getting to drill, getting to do electrical, stuff like that.”"
Airbus H160 receives FAA approval - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Sun, 02 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWgxNjAtcmVjZWl2ZXMtZmFhLWFwcHJvdmFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Helicopters H160 has finally received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), paving the way for the medium-lift aircraft to begin operations in the United States.

PHI will become the first operator to fly the H160 in North America. Airbus Helicopters Photo

The type is now ready to begin a much-anticipated “route proving” program with PHI in the Gulf of Mexico — a U.S. entry-into-service planned since early 2021. The operator has an initial order for four of the type.

The FAA approval comes almost exactly three years after the type was certified the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Airbus had originally hoped FAA approval would follow soon afterwards, with the type slated for first delivery to a U.S. customer later in 2020.

However, the FAA opened up more certification topics than Airbus anticipated following EASA’s approval, and the OEM’s work in reopening those topics, discussing them, and closing them was heavily impacted by the Covid-enforced necessity to do that work remotely.

In a press release announcing the FAA certification, Airbus called it “a significant milestone” in the aircraft’s development.

Airbus chief test pilot Hervé Jammayrac talks about the manufacturer’s new medium-lift aircraft, the H160.

“We are pleased to receive FAA certification for the H160, which is testament to many years of hard work and commitment from our teams in order to deliver this multirole helicopter to the customers in North America who have already placed their trust in the H160,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

“This aircraft features the highest level of innovation and we are confident that its advanced capabilities, along with our strong customer support network, will solidify its position as the preferred choice for customers in the U.S.”

The type’s entry into service will eventually be aided by North America’s first H160 level D full flight simulator, which will be located at the Helisim Simulation Center inside Airbus Helicopters Inc.’s facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Airbus expects the simulator to be in service in the “second half” of 2025.

The H160, unveiled at HAI Heli-Expo in March 2015, is powered by the 1,200-horsepower Safran Arrano, and features a number of innovations, including a fully composite airframe, Airbus’s proprietary noise-reducing Blue Edge rotor blades, electrical landing gear, a canted Fenestron tail rotor for greater useful load, and a biplane horizontal stabilizer.

Airbus has received more than 100 orders for the H160, including more than a dozen destined for U.S. customers. It first entered service in Japan with All Nippon Helicopter in December 2021, and has since operated in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Europe. All told, the global H160 fleet has clocked more than 1,700 flight hours.

The start of service with PHI will mark the H160’s entry into the oil-and-gas sector, in which it operates as a 12-seater aircraft. It has already flown in newsgathering, VIP, and search-and-rescue (SAR) operations.

At a pre-Heli-Expo media briefing earlier this year, Airbus said it would pursue FAA approval of its H175 super medium as soon as the H160 had completed the process."
Airbus to report improvement in delivery numbers - Airport Technology,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtcmVwb3J0LWltcHJvdmVtZW50LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW51bWJlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is looking to reach a target of 720 aircraft deliveries in 2023.

Airbus will report a 6% increase in deliveries in its first half reports for 2023, according to industry sources.

Reuters has reported that the French aircraft manufacturer will have delivered 316 aircraft in the first six months of 2023, compared to 297 in the same period for 2022.

Sources also revealed that delivery numbers in June were up 20% from last year with 72 planes delivered by Airbus through the month.

The company has already publicly marked a strong start to the year in its orders department after receiving orders for over 800 aircraft at the Pairs Air Show alone.

Though the numbers are already up on last year, Airbus still has a way to go to reach its target of delivering 720 commercial aircraft for the year, something that the company will be keen to do after failing to reach its 2022 target.

Despite post-pandemic supply chain issues affecting output, aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing are looking to ramp up production in response to wider industry demand as airlines look to recover from pandemic slumps and move forward with fleet replacements.

UK reducing New Medium Helicopter buy to 25-35 aircraft: Airbus exec - Breaking Defense,"Sat, 15 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L3VrLXJlZHVjaW5nLW5ldy1tZWRpdW0taGVsaWNvcHRlci1idXktdG8tMjUtMzUtYWlyY3JhZnQtYWlyYnVzLWV4ZWMv0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9icmVha2luZ2RlZmVuc2UuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvdWstcmVkdWNpbmctbmV3LW1lZGl1bS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWJ1eS10by0yNS0zNS1haXJjcmFmdC1haXJidXMtZXhlYy8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated at 7/17/23 at 2:45pm ET to include a statement from the British Ministry of Defense saying no NMH “advertised requirement” has changed.

RIAT 2023 — The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has decided to slash the number of aircraft set to be acquired under the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program to a maximum of 35 units, an industry official told Breaking Defense today.

An upper limit of 44 aircraft had originally been set in November 2021, but funding issues have led to a much lower target.

“They’ve [MoD] said between 25 to 35 [aircraft], see what you can do in industry,” Lenny Brown, managing director of Airbus Helicopters UK, said in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo. “It’s a kind of best effort with the funding available.”

On July 17, two days after the original publication of this report, the MoD provided a statement to Breaking Defense indicating 44 helicopters is officially still part of an “advertised requirement,” as per a 18 May 2022 contract notice.

The acquisition calls for the replacement of Puma helicopters and a number of smaller rotary fleets, including Bell 212, Bell 412 and AS365 Dauphins, but delays have led to an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) phase, initially scheduled for Q1 2023, being pushed to later this year. The new phase, which will define full requirements and costs, will only happen “at the earliest” in September this year, added Brown.

The UK has also still to confirm when a production contract award will happen or an NMH entry to service date.

Brown explained a number of initial requirements based around “capability, performance and engineering support” have, however, been outlined to industry by the MoD.

“We haven’t seen training requirements and there’s a whole plethora of different chapters that are yet to come, but the MoD has been as good as they can be in drip feeding us information,” he added.

Competitors have also been “directed” by the MoD to use a number of defensive aid kits to prepare for any testing and compliance that would be required once an aircraft production selection has been made, he said. The UK MoD did not immediately respond to an off-hours request for comment on its New Medium Helicopter plans.

If selected, Airbus plans on standing up a H175M helicopter production line in Broughton, Wales, where it currently manufacturers A380 commercial airliner wings, but faces competition from Leonardo UK, offering AW149 helicopters, and Lockheed Martin’s S-70M Black Hawk.

Airbus hopes that a deal with the UK could open the way for H175M export sales, with a market of around 500 “platforms in specific countries” of interest, according to Brown.

“There’s already demand signals coming from some of them,” he explained, without mentioning individual nations.

The UK had also been expected to retire the Puma fleet in 2025, leaving industry potentially faced with a compressed NMH production timeline, though Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, Chief of the Air Staff, told lawmakers in May that an extension to 2027 or 2028 could be made.

Brown expressed few concerns about any potential shifts to production timelines.

“All we need to do is press the button [at Broughton] and we can immediately procure jigs and tools,” he explained. “Basic systems and training are all in place so it won’t take very long to set production up and start cranking the handle.”"

The contract has a duration of 7.5 years and serves as an extension of the A400M In-Service Support contract that had been in place since December 2014.

“This contract extension shows a long-term commitment of the German government to the A400M. Together with the customer, we have made big strides in recent years to improve availability as well as the operational capabilities of the A400M, which has become an indispensable asset in Germany’s air force inventory”, said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems of Airbus Defence and Space. “This contract allows us to deepen our fruitful cooperation which, I believe, can serve as a role model of how industry and customers can work together successfully.”

The industrial technical support of the German Air Force A400M fleet covers a wide range of services provided by the Airbus Support Centre in Wunstorf Air Base and the central Centres of Competence in Getafe, Spain.

Airbus will ensure full coverage of scheduled Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services from its main MRO base in Manching, near Munich as well as at Wunstorf Air Base, near Hannover, Germany and at Hannover Airport.

The contract also foresees the establishment of a new A400M maintenance facility in direct proximity to Wunstorf Air Base. Commencing operations in 2027, the facility will perform MRO services and also host the Airbus A400M Support Centre with a total workforce of approximately 300 who will work hand in glove with suppliers and customer representatives. Construction work will commence with immediate effect.

Germany is the biggest customer of the A400M. Currently, the Luftwaffe operates 40 A400M out of a total of 53 aircraft on order. The entire fleet operates out of Wunstorf Air Base which is home to the Air Transport Wing 62 (Lufttransportgeschwader 62).

Airbus Helicopters has unveiled the livery for its Racer high-speed demonstrator and said it is working toward the experimental aircraft’s first flight by the end of 2023.

The livery appears in a brief video posted to social media from an account belonging to Bruno Even, the company’s CEO.

In the video, workers appear to use augmented reality headsets to position elements of the mostly-white paint job, with a navy blue tail, orange accents around the cabin windows, and several grey and blue hexagonal embellishments.

The Racer demonstrator is designed as a high-speed vertical takeoff and landing successor to the Airbus X3, with two propellers mounted on short wings, and a target cruise speed of 215 knots.

Workers in the Airbus Helicopters paint shop appeared to use augmented reality to plot the paint scheme and simulate missing elements of the airframe. Airbus Helicopers/Twitter Photo

Airbus previously said it was targeting Racer’s first flight in 2020, and again in 2022, but the launch has been delayed. In the Twitter post, Even said the project’s next step is to finalize assembly and ground testing prior to a first flight later this year.

Workers applied the livery to a partially-complete airframe, absent the forward-thrusting propellers called for in artists’ renderings. The partial airframe also appears not to include the Racer’s four-bladed horizontal rotor.

Workers appeared to use augmented reality to simulate the missing hardware before manually plotting the livery design with tape and paper before applying paint."

The H175M is a military version of Airbus Helicopters’ H175 super-medium-weight, twin-engine civil rotorcraft.

It is one of the contenders for the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement.

The multi-role military helicopter is designed to provide optimised performance for a wide range of missions in different operating conditions ranging from sea level to hot-and-high environments.

UK’s new medium helicopter competition details

The MOD seeks to procure a fleet of modern medium-lift support helicopters, under the NMH programme, to replace several existing helicopters that are in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the British Army.

The NMH programme is expected to replace the Westland Puma, Bell’s 212 and 412 models and Airbus Dauphin helicopters.

The requirement to acquire the new helicopter was first revealed in the Defence Command Paper, released in April 2021. In the same year, the MOD shortlisted four companies, including Airbus, Leonardo, Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s subsidiary Sikorsky, to compete for the NMH programme.

Apart from the H175M, other platforms in the competition include Leonardo’s AW149 and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk.

H175M Task Force details

Airbus Helicopters launched the H175M Task Force at the Royal International Air Tattoo military air show held at the RAF Fairford in the UK in July 2022.

The task force includes international defence company Babcock, UK-based aircraft ejection seat designer and manufacturer Martin Baker, Canada-based aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, Scotland Spirit AeroSystems and US-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing.

Babcock agreed to serve as the support partner for the H175M at military operating locations.

Martin Baker will provide specialist troop seating and cabin integration services, as part of the task force.

Pratt & Whitney Canada will supply the PT6C-67E turboshaft engines and provide associated support services.

Scotland Spirit AeroSystems is providing detailed design and manufacturing services for the helicopter.

Boeing, which joined the task force in March 2023, will provide aircrew, groundcrew and maintenance training services through its Boeing Defence UK subsidiary if the H175M is selected for the NMH programme.

H175M design and features

The H175M helicopter is 18.06m long and has an overall height of 5.34m. It has a maximum take-off weight of 7,800kg.

The helicopter can carry up to two pilots and 18 passengers with ergonomic back-to-back foldable seats. Its larger doors enable faster and easier entry and exit for soldiers.

The rotorcraft can operate in temperatures ranging between -40°C and 50°C.

The platform offers long-range and all-weather capability to support deployments in challenging conditions. It comes with a full icing protection system.

The H175M provides 12m³ of cabin space, which is claimed to be the largest for a helicopter of its size.

The fuel tanks are fully integrated into the airframe structure, thereby eliminating restrictions on cabin capacity. The design provides high-ground clearance to support operations in different terrain types and does not expose the platform to external threats.

The cabin provides direct access to the 2.3m³ internal cargo area. The helicopter is also armed with two window-mounted machine guns.

Troops can rappel and fast rope on both sides of the aircraft during special forces missions.

In addition to troop transport, the H175M can be deployed to perform missions such as the delivery of special operations forces, combat search and rescue and utility and casualty evacuation/medical evacuation.

Avionics system onboard the super-medium helicopter

The helicopter is equipped with Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix avionics system to provide operators with increased mission flexibility and enhanced safety.

The cockpit layout increases situational awareness during challenging mission profiles, including nap-of-the-earth flight, a very low-altitude near-terrain flight operation performed by military aircraft to avoid detection by enemy forces.

Equipped with four intuitive multi-function electronic displays, Helionix reduces the workload for pilots and frees them to focus on more important tasks during the mission. The system displays only the most important details of a flight phase, with input from the electro-optical system.

Furthermore, the flight deck features a dual-duplex four-axis digital automatic flight control system (AFCS), which ensures precision and stability during flight.

The AFCS system enables automatic recovery in case of pilot disorientation and includes a new detection system to prevent the pilot from entering the vortex ring state. Its traffic alert and collision avoidance system unction helps minimise the risk of mid-air collisions with other aircraft.

The AFCS also ensures easier and safe final approaches to prevent the risk of collision with terrain at low altitudes and a hands-off approach to mitigate risks in the event of failure of one of the engines.

H175M’s electronic warfare system details

An electronic warfare system (EWS) is integrated into the helicopter to enhance self-protection and survivability. The EWS suite comprises a laser warning system and missile approach warning sensors. It also includes chaff and flares countermeasures dispenser pods to avoid detection and attack by adversary air defence systems.

H175M’s engine and performance

The H175M is powered by two proven PT6C-67E turboshaft engines equipped with a dual-channel full-authority digital electronic control system, which protects the engine and reduces the pilot’s workload.

Each PT6C-67E engine delivers a mechanical power of about 1,300 shaft horsepower (shp) and a thermodynamic power output of 1,800shp.

The underfloor standard fuel tanks provide a capacity of 2,067kg, which is the largest capacity in its class.

The helicopter can carry a cargo sling load of 2,700kg in a single hook operation. It can reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft and achieve a maximum cruise speed of 150kt.

The maximum range of the aircraft with the standard fuel tank is 600nm (1,111km), while the maximum endurance is six hours."

A partnership between Bishop State Community College and airplane manufacturer Airbus, Flight Path 9 is a fledgling pre-apprentice program designed to put high schoolers on a path to careers at Airbus’ only U.S. airplane assembly plant located right in their backyard.

Berault and more than 40 other just-graduated high school seniors from across the Mobile area attended classes at Bishop State from 4 to 8 p.m. two nights a week this past school year.

High school seniors start learning to build airliners at night and over summer break

This summer, they pack a workshop floor at Bishop State for 32 hours a week to learn manufacturing skills like riveting, precision cutting, and using multimeters.

In August, most will become full apprentices at the Airbus Final Assembly Line, where they will be paid real salaries while they continue to learn and work on the A220 airliners used by Delta, Air Canada and Air France.

“Some students say when you’re going into this two days every week, ‘I just don’t want to do that,’ because it’s taking up their senior year,” said Berault, who graduated this spring. “But I think it was completely worth it.”

“I feel like I didn’t know much of anything when I came into this program, but the amount I’ve learned in the past couple months is just insane.”

Fellow trainee Nicole Olivares, whose parents both work for Airbus, was also excited about a chance to work in aviation. She urged students to join the program, even with the classes two nights a week.

“I think it’s so worth it,” she said. “You can still do other things. You have a life outside of Flightworks.”

Based in France, Airbus is one of the two largest airliner manufacturers in the world. It’s also very used to training new employees at a young age. As is typical in Europe, its plants there start students as full-time apprentices at around age 15 or the equivalent of junior year of high school here.

But that’s part of the culture in Europe, where general high school education typically ends after 10th grade and students must shift into either a career skills or an intense university academic path. With the United States locked into its 12-year system of students working toward a general high school diploma, Airbus can’t just bring its European model here and start apprentices at 15. Students still have to finish high school.

But company officials knew even as they opened the Mobile plant in 2015 that they needed a pipeline for high school students to train to work there. Michelle Hurdle, director of workforce and economic development of Airbus Americas Inc., started visiting other Airbus facilities and began working with schools, community groups, and Bishop State to create a curriculum and program that launched in 2019. After a hiatus because of the pandemic, the program re-started in fall of 2022.

“We want our facility to reflect our community,” Hurdle said. “So what better way to do that than to recruit and train and grow from within because that’s what creates loyalty.”

Students in the program earn a certificate in Aviation Manufacturing Technology from Bishop State and can earn several industry certifications for working with things like blueprints, sheet metal, and multimeters. They also leave with 18 credit hours that can go toward an aviation manufacturing associates degree when Bishop launches that degree program in the fall of 2024.

Having credentials that matter to most manufacturers, not just for Airbus, was important from the start, said Hurdle and Akareem Spears, dean of workforce and economic development at Bishop State,

“Just say 5-10 years from now, they don’t want to work at Airbus, they still have these credentials that they can take with them,” Spears said. “These individuals have something that are tangible that they can carry with them.”

During the school year, Bishop State instructors and others from a nonprofit created by Airbus teach the evening classes. Students are not paid for that time but are given dinner at the school.

“No mama wants to cook at 8:30 when your children come home,” Hurdle said.

In the summer, students are paid a $40 per day stipend as they take classes for five weeks. Airbus declined to say what apprentices are paid during the 14-month apprenticeship. As apprentices, they are monitored and have their work checked by full employees and only work independently after completing the apprenticeship.

Airbus and the college want to go even further with Flight Path 9 over time.

“Hopefully, we can start younger, and start getting into middle schools, and maybe by elementary school,” Spears said. “We can introduce multimeters and all those kinds of things early on, and we built an ecosystem.”

Berault said he may go back to school someday to earn the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airframe and Powerplant license or to be an engineer. For now, though, he is anxious to start as an apprentice.

“I love the work,” he said. “I love being busy. I just like having stuff to do with my hands, like getting to drill, getting to do electrical, stuff like that.”

"Airbus' Autopilot Technology Is So Safe, You'll Never Want to Fly Without It - ReadWrite","Wed, 12 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcmVhZHdyaXRlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYXV0b3BpbG90LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaXMtc28tc2FmZS15b3VsbC1uZXZlci13YW50LXRvLWZseS13aXRob3V0LWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After 50 years of progress, the aviation industry is now safer and more efficient than ever before, thanks in large part to Airbus’ pioneering work in this area. The advancement of autopilot systems in recent years is among the most noteworthy developments because of the way they have changed the nature of the pilot’s job. Airbus has invested heavily in R&D in this area with the goal of increasing the autonomy of their aircraft. In this piece, we’ll take a look at the state of autopilot technology today, with a special emphasis on Airbus’s innovative Project Dragonfly.

The Airbus campus in Toulouse is massive, accommodating 28,000 employees and thousands of curious onlookers each year. Airbus conducts a lot of its R&D there as well, including on their Project Dragonfly. Enhanced automatic landing, taxi assistance, and automatic emergency diversion were the primary goals of this experiment.

Project Dragonfly’s dramatic breakthrough was the creation of an automatic emergency descent system. If the pilots need to concentrate on complex tasks or become incapacitated, this technology will take over. The plane can descend and land while identifying other planes, weather, and terrain under its command. The system also enables the plane to communicate with ground control via radio using a synthetic voice generated by AI. The plane has to figure out everything on its own, like tuning in to airport messages from ATC and picking the best alternative landing spot. Two emergency descents were completed by Project Dragonfly, and the aircraft safely landed in France thanks to the understanding of French air traffic controllers.

The use of various sensors to aid in an autonomous landing was also investigated in Project Dragonfly. Conventional cameras, infrared cameras, and radar were all incorporated into this system. In order to model a wide range of climates, the team gathered data from all over the world. With the additional sensors, the pilot can keep a closer eye on the landing. The closer you get to an object, the more heat an infrared sensor can detect, making infrared cameras useful even in cloudy conditions. The pilot maintains command of the plane at all times during the landing process, but technological aids such as audible alerts provide guidance on speed and direction. This technology is meant to reassure the pilot that they are headed in the right direction and will arrive safely at the runway.

Especially at the busiest airports in the world, taxi driving can be the most difficult part of the job. The pilot retains command of the aircraft at all times, while the crew receives audible warnings from the technology. The aircraft will sound an alarm and provide speed guidance as it approaches obstacles. In addition to reducing the pilot’s workload, this feature guides passengers to the runway as the plane taxis.

Some may wonder if, in the future, passenger planes will need pilots at all, given the advent of such sophisticated autopilot technologies. Airbus is quick to note, however, that additional automation will be implemented only when safety permits, and that the goal is not to do away with pilots altogether. Only if it was absolutely certain that doing so would ensure the safety of both passengers and crew members would fully automated aircraft be implemented. The likelihood of being involved in an air accident is extremely low, but the pilot’s ability to keep everyone on board safe is still paramount.

Autopilot systems have advanced technologically, but not all pilots are happy with the idea of a computer deciding whether or not a flight lands safely. Two well-rested and trained pilots can make better decisions than any piece of automation on the flight deck. Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association, cited the two fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 as an example of the dangers of relying too heavily on automated systems. However, Airbus is committed to guaranteeing the safe and reliable introduction of new technologies, and pilots will always be at the center of every flight.

The collaboration builds on evaluations already conducted by both companies to explore the benefits of wide bandgap semiconductor materials for aircraft electrification. Wide bandgap semiconductors like Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) have superior electrical properties compared with traditional semiconductors like silicon. They enable the development of smaller, lighter and more efficient high-performance electronic devices and systems, particularly in applications requiring high power, high frequency, or high-temperature operations.

The co-operation will focus on developing SiC and GaN devices, packages, and modules adapted for Airbus’ aerospace applications. The companies will assess these components by conducting advanced research and tests on demonstrators, such as e-motor control units, high and low voltage power converters, and wireless power transfer systems.

“This collaboration with STMicroelectronics, a global leader in power semiconductors and wide bandgap technologies, will be key to support Airbus’ electrification roadmap,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “Leveraging their expertise and experience in power electronics for automotive and industrial applications with our own record in aircraft and VTOL electrification will help us accelerate the development of the disruptive technologies required for the ZEROe roadmap and CityAirbus NextGen.”

“STMicroelectronics is the market leader at the cutting edge of the development of innovative power semiconductors with higher-efficiency products and solutions based on advanced materials, such as Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride. We already have a strong, transformational presence in mobility and industrial applications, reinforced by a vertically integrated global SiC supply chain, to support our customers globally with electrification and decarbonization,” said Jerome Roux, President, Sales & Marketing, STMicroelectronics. “Aerospace is a highly demanding market with specific requirements. Cooperating with Airbus, a global leader in this industry, gives us the opportunity to define together new power technologies the industry needs to realize its decarbonization goals.”"

Review: Qantas First Class Airbus A380 (SYD-LAX) - One Mile at a Time,"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvcWFudGFzLWZpcnN0LWNsYXNzLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the last (but certainly not least) segment of my round the world trip with dad, we flew Qantas’ Airbus A380 first class from Sydney to Los Angeles. I was looking forward to this flight, as it had been years since I had flown Qantas first class.

Historically I haven’t been a huge fan of Qantas, as I don’t have any nationalistic pride in the airline, and I find Qantas’ onboard product to largely be pretty mediocre. However, this flight left me with a very positive impression, and I was pleasantly surprised.

While Qantas first class isn’t cutting edge, the airline offers an exceptionally comfortable bed, a pretty great restaurant-quality dining experience, nice amenities, and genuine service that strikes the perfect balance between being professional and personable.

Admittedly there are also some areas for improvement. In particular, Qantas doesn’t have Wi-Fi on its Airbus A380s, and the food and drink selection also isn’t as high-end as you’d find in some of the world’s top first class products.

With that out of the way, let’s get into the review…

How I booked our Qantas first class tickets

Qantas first class award space is incredibly difficult to come by, and it’s like finding a needle in a haystack. Actually, I based our entire itinerary around this segment, since I figured that when I saw two transpacific Qantas first class award seats, I had to book.

I booked our Qantas first class tickets using American AAdvantage miles. Specifically, I ticketed the following for 110,000 American AAdvantage miles plus $79.75 in taxes and fees per person:

5/25 QF11 Sydney to Los Angeles departing 10:20AM arriving 7:05AM

I found availability directly on aa.com, and booked a little over two weeks before departure.

Qantas first class lounge & boarding

In the previous installment I reviewed the Qantas First Lounge Sydney, which is one of my favorite first class lounges in the world. Boarding for our flight to Los Angeles was supposed to start at 9:35AM, 45 minutes before departure. The flight was departing from gate 8, just a short walk from the lounge.

Qantas departure gate Sydney Airport

So we headed down there a bit early — sadly there was no view of the plane, due to how the gate is configured. As boarding time approached there was no sign of boarding and also no announcement about a delay.

I asked a staff member, and they explained the flight would probably be delayed by around an hour, as the aircraft hadn’t yet been towed in from the cargo bay. You’d think that would be something they could announce. But hey, with former American CEO Doug Parker now on the board of Qantas, maybe this is a feature rather than a bug. 😉

Anyway, the lack of communication was frustrating, especially since the plane had been on the ground since 5AM, so it wasn’t clear what was causing the delay. Boarding finally started at 10:35AM, around an hour behind schedule, with first class being invited to board first.

On Qantas, first class passengers are all escorted onto the plane together by a ground agent, and she was lovely. I was excited to board VH-OQK, the roughly 12-year-old Airbus A380 that would be flying us across the Pacific.

Qantas A380 first class cabin & seats

Qantas has its first class cabin at the front of the lower deck. As much as I enjoy flying on the upper deck, there’s something to be said for the wider fuselage on the lower deck, which makes the cabin feel much more spacious.

Qantas’ Airbus A380 first class consists of a total of 14 seats, spread across five rows in a 1-1-1 configuration (with the center section only having four rows).

Qantas Airbus A380 first class cabin

The center seats can be accessed from the right aisle, meaning that nine passengers use the right aisle, while five passengers use the left aisle. That’s why the window seats on the left side are generally viewed as the best, since they feel a bit more private. That’s especially true when you consider that the center seats have privacy partitions on the left side that can be raised.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class cabin

I assigned us seats 4A and 5A, the two window seats on the left side in the back of the cabin. Even if you’re traveling with someone, there’s no point in getting seats across from one another, since it’s not like you’d be able to practically communicate and enjoy the flight together anyway.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class cabin

While Qantas doesn’t have fully enclosed suites in first class, the seats are incredibly spacious, and thoughtfully designed. When you board, the seats are fully facing forward. Meanwhile the ottoman is at an angle, and that’s because the seat can be swiveled after takeoff.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat

The seat itself is very well padded, and has a shoulder harness that needs to be worn during takeoff and landing.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat

Immediately across from the seat is a tray table that can be folded up or down, which is an ideal place to put a drink, without using the full tray table. That’s also where the literature pocket is located.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat

The seat’s ottoman is a great size, and it can be used as a buddy seat if you want to dine face-to-face with someone. However, it’s definitely not the most comfortable ottoman to sit on for an extended period of time.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat

There’s quite a bit of stuff to the side of the seat, including two surfaces on which you can store things during the flight.

The tray table extends from the side of the seat, and is absolutely massive. Even just extending it or storing it takes quite some effort, given how heavy and bulky it is.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat tray table

There are two fully enclosed storage compartments to the side of the seat, which are a great place to store your passport, chargers, etc. Just make sure you remember if you placed something here, because it can be easy to forget.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat storage

There’s a handy monitor to the side of the seat, which controls all of the seat functions. There are either some pre-sets, or you can customize each part of the seat individually.

The monitor can even be used to control the window shades, which have electric curtains and dimmers.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat windows

Also on the armrest of the seat is an entertainment controller.

Charging ports are to the side of the seat, and include an AC and USB-A outlet.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class seat power outlets

One thing I appreciate about Qantas is the individual air nozzles. While the overhead console doesn’t have any air nozzles, the seat does have a couple of these installed, which is fantastic for those of us who easily get hot.

All-in-all, I was very happy with our seat choices. Sitting in 5A, I couldn’t see any other passenger. I also can’t help but comment on how the center seat right under the staircase must be one of the strangest first class seats out there.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class cabin

Qantas first class amenities

As far as amenities go, there were two pillows and a blanket waiting at each seat upon boarding. This was only part of the bedding, as more bedding was provided with turndown service.

Qantas first class pillow & blanket

There were also headphones at each seat upon boarding, which were totally fine, but nothing special.

Qantas first class headphones

Within moments of settling in, the first class flight attendant working our aisle, Rob, came by to introduce himself. Yvette, who would be working the galley, also came by to welcome us onboard. We were offered pre-departure drinks, and my dad and I both selected champagne.

Qantas currently serves Duval-Leroy Clos des Bouveries 2006 in first class, which I found to be fine, but nothing too memorable. We were also offered some nuts and olives to go along with the pre-departure drinks. I always love when airlines have a little pre-departure snack in first class.

We were then offered the amenities for the flight, which I found to be excellent. This included a very comfortable pair of pajamas, specifically branded for first class (Qantas also offers pajamas in business class).

Qantas first class pajamas

We were given slippers, which were among the sturdiest and most stylish I’ve ever seen offered on a plane.

Qantas first class slippers

We were offered an amenity kit with socks, eyeshades, earplugs, a dental kit, lip balm, and a couple of creams. Again, I quite liked the design of the kit.

Lastly, we were presented with the menu for the flight, with the explanation that we could eat whenever we wanted.

Qantas A380 first class entertainment & Wi-Fi

What’s Qantas’ Airbus A380 first class entertainment like? Let’s start with the bad news — Qantas doesn’t offer Wi-Fi on its A380s. The good news is that Qantas plans to eventually offer Wi-Fi on its A380s, though that’ll only happen several years down the road.

The good news is that Qantas’ inflight entertainment selection is excellent, with a seemingly endless selection of movies and TV shows. I found the system to be easy to use, and quite liked the choices.

I also very much liked the moving map feature, plus the A380 tail camera.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class entertainment system

I ended up watching a few episodes of “Single, Out,” which was a sort-of-entertaining gay rom-com.

Qantas Airbus A380 first class entertainment system

Anyway, while I wish Qantas had Wi-Fi (especially given how long some of the carrier’s routes are), at least the entertainment was good.

Qantas A380 departure from Sydney

Despite the flight being almost completely full, boarding was efficient. Throughout this time I enjoyed listening to Qantas’ boarding music, which is incredibly soothing, and among my favorite offered by any airline.

At around 11AM, cabin service manager Simon made his welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 12h35min. Finally at 11:10AM the main cabin door closed (there was only one empty seat in first class), at which point the safety video was screened. It’s a video that many avgeeks will appreciate!

At 11:15AM we began our pushback, and at 11:25AM we began our taxi. We didn’t have a long wait for our departure, and were cleared for takeoff on runway 34L at around 11:35AM. No matter how often I fly the A380, I can’t help but stare at the tail camera and be mesmerized by how easily and gracefully this whale lifts off the ground.

Anyway, our climb out was smooth, and the seatbelt sign was turned off about five minutes after departure.

Qantas first class lunch service

Once we reached cruising altitude, the lunch service began. The entire service was performed at a rather leisurely pace, but that didn’t bother me one bit, given the length of this flight, plus the morning departure. The crew took their time interacting with each passenger, and would often have an extended conversation with people while performing the service.

I also find it cute how Qantas crews change uniforms during the meal service, and wear something more in line with what you’d expect a server in a nice restaurant to wear, rather than a flight attendant.

You can find the entire lunch menu and drink list below.

Qantas first class drink list

Drink and meal orders were taken around 30 minutes after takeoff, and drinks were served 15 minutes after that. I figured I’d mix things up and order the Qantas Sky Spritz, which consisted of a white wine spritz with lime and plum. It was refreshing, though I do think the presentation could have been zhuzhed up a bit.

The canapés consisted of caviar on blinis with crème fraîche, and smoked salmon on crostini with cornichons, tomato jam, and chives. Both were tasty, and that was the extent of the caviar service.

Qantas first class lunch — cocktail and canapés

After the cocktail, I decided to switch back to champagne.

Qantas first class lunch — champagne

My table was set around 90 minutes after takeoff, and at that time I was also offered a bread selection, with some delicious options, including caramelized garlic bread.

For the starter, I selected the mezze plate with sweet potato hummus, baby eggplant, goat cheese, tabbouleh, and lavosh, which was absolutely delicious.

Qantas first class lunch — starter

My dad selected the parsnip soup with pancetta, hazelnuts, and greek yogurt, which he also enjoyed.

Qantas first class lunch — soup

For the main course, I selected the toothfish with saffron sauce, steamed fingerling potatoes, and braised fennel, along with a side salad. The dish was excellent, and honestly, this has to be one of the most nicely presented dishes I’ve been served in first class. Plating dishes on planes isn’t easy, but in this case the dish was plated in a way that would make you think you’re in a restaurant.

Qantas first class lunch — main course

My dad ordered the fillet of beef with green beans and toasted almonds, which he also very much enjoyed.

While my dad skipped dessert, I decided to have the affogato with vanilla bean ice cream and macadamia biscotti. What a simple but tasty treat.

Qantas first class lunch — dessert

The meal service was completed around three hours after takeoff. There are definitely airlines that invest a bit more in their first class catering in terms of a proper caviar course, alcohol, etc. However, I really enjoyed this meal, both in terms of the service and the food quality.

I also liked all the little touches to the service. For example, with each dish we were offered some cracked pepper, and water was poured out of pitchers, rather than bottles.

Qantas A380 first class lavatories

After the meal, I checked out the lavatories. There are two first class lavatories on the A380, one on each side of the staircase. The lavatories aren’t huge, though they aren’t small either. What impressed me most was how the crew kept these very clean throughout the flight.

The lavatories also had some amenities, like deodorant and shaving kits.

Qantas A380 business class lounge

Qantas has an onboard lounge on its Airbus A380s, located at the front of the upper deck, where business class is located. So of course we decided to check this out.

Qantas Airbus A380 staircase

This isn’t really an onboard bar, but rather it’s just a different place you can sit. When you’re facing the front of the cabin, the right side is a big larger, and contains two booths where you can sit.

Then the left side has an L-shaped couch.

Qantas Airbus A380 business class bar

There’s a large television monitor in the lounge area, where you can keep an eye on the progress of the flight.

Qantas Airbus A380 business class bar

There’s also an area with a fridge, but it wasn’t stocked when we checked it out.

Qantas Airbus A380 business class bar

Ultimately this lounge is built in a place where you couldn’t otherwise place seats (due to the lack of windows). While the design is impressive, I just don’t find the execution here to be very good in terms of adding value for customers. Those in first and business class already have a comfortable place to sit, so I’m not sure what the value-add is of these booths. I think a bar area where you could stand and stretch your legs would be more useful. But that’s just me…

Qantas A380 first class bed

Prior to checking out the bar, I had asked the crew to make my bed (meanwhile my dad continued his longstanding tradition of insisting on sleeping in the upright position). 😉

Qantas must have one of the most comfortable beds in the sky. Not only is the sleeping surface large and comfortable, but the bedding is sublime. The mattress pad is thick, while the blanket is both cozy yet breathable.

I was super tired at this point in the flight, and wanted to get as much rest as possible prior to a full day in the United States, since we were landing in the morning. I ended up going to sleep just over three hours after departure, as we were over Fiji, with around 9hr30min remaining to Los Angeles.

I then woke up around 2hr45min prior to our arrival in Los Angeles, as we out over the open Pacific.

Getting nearly seven hours of sleep on a plane is virtually unheard of for me (I’m a horrible airplane sleeper), so I was very happy with that.

Qantas first class breakfast service

Rob checked on me shortly after waking up, and asked if I was ready for breakfast. While I first ordered a coffee, I also put in a breakfast order. You can find the breakfast menu below.

I started with a delicious flat white, which would be one of my last tastes of Australian(ish) coffee on this trip…

Then I ordered an avocado toast to eat, and then a green juice and an espresso to drink. I feel like airplane breakfasts are typically so boring, and almost always consist of eggs or pancakes (or something along the lines), so I was happy to see avocado toast on the menu.

I also then ordered some granola, which I enjoyed as well.

My dad and I both agreed that service on this flight was very good, and that’s thanks primarily to Rob. He was such a nice guy who genuinely seemed to enjoy his job, and clearly took pride in it. He was professional, personable, and wanted everyone to feel like a guest. Top marks to Rob. At the end of the day, service can make or break a flight.

Qantas A380 arrival in Los Angeles

At around 6:40AM Los Angeles time, the second officer announced that we’d be starting our descent in about 15 minutes, and should be landing around 7:30AM. Given our very late departure, that wasn’t too bad, as we were due to land at 7:05AM, but fortunately the flight time was shorter than planned.

At this point I repacked my bags, changed back into my regular clothes, and turned on the tail camera, so that I could enjoy view of landing.

At 7:20AM the seatbelt sign was turned on, and just five minutes after that we landed on runway 24R.

We had a very long taxi to our arrival gate, and pulled in there at around 7:40AM.

Upon arriving we bid farewell to the crew, cleared immigration, and then my dad and I went on our respective ways, after a super fun but exhausting (especially for my dad) adventure!

Bottom line

While Qantas doesn’t have the world’s best or must cutting edge first class product, it’s a very pleasant experience. Qantas first class features super comfortable seats, one of the best beds in the sky, very friendly service, great entertainment, lots of amenities, and tasty and nicely presented food.

All that being said, it’s not perfect. There’s no Wi-Fi on the A380, the size of the first class cabin will make it feel less exclusive than some other first class products, and there aren’t quite as many high-end aspects to the food and beverage service as you’d find on some other airlines.

Nonetheless I had a great flight in Qantas first class. It’s definitely a lot better than flying American Airlines first class on the same route, unless you really value Wi-Fi.

What’s your take on Qantas’ A380 first class?"
Airbus Initiative Aims To Elevate Africa’s Local MRO Capabilities - Aviation Week,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9haXJidXMtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS1haW1zLWVsZXZhdGUtYWZyaWNhcy1sb2NhbC1tcm8tY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” This proverb mirrors a new Airbus initiative that aims to help African airlines strengthen local maintenance capabilities, reducing the need to ferry aircraft to other continents.

“If an African operator decides to go abroad to Europe, the U.S. or wherever [for maintenance], it should be by choice and not because there is not enough offered on the continent,” said Airbus African Support Strategy Project Leader Cheikh Diop during a recent webinar.

Airbus is not swooping in to fix Africa’s problems. Instead, the airframer wants African companies to take the lead, asking for help where needed.

“We want to push for Africa’s autonomy,” Diop said. “What we want to do is to facilitate solutions that will be designed by Africa, for Africa. We’re here to help—not the other way around, where people come and ask us to do [the work for them].”

Airbus has run other African support projects, but this initiative is more structured, with a longer-term perspective. “We’ve already started to make some concrete steps. And very clearly, we’re thinking big and wide,” Diop said.

Diop, an aeronautical engineer with Senegalese and Mauritanian roots, knows the African market firsthand. He sees a shortage of MRO capacity, particularly in West Africa, where there is high growth. However, MRO facilities in other regions of the continent are underutilized because operators often take their aircraft elsewhere for MRO.

“The first point is to understand the root cause,” Diop said. “Is it because they don’t trust existing facilities? Is it because they’re certified by an authority that maybe they don’t know? I have no idea. We need to understand this first, because if it is due to a lack of trust, maybe as an OEM we can help facilitate this level of trust by giving an independent view.” If the problem is that the facility lacks certifications or qualifications, Airbus may able be able to help with this as well.

Diop also sees a lack of collaboration among African MROs. He used Airbus’ own structure as a partnership between four countries to illustrate. “If [the Airbus partner countries] did not collaborate, I don’t know if we would be where we are today,” he said. “As a second example, we team up with all our competitors when we have to shape the industry of tomorrow.”

MRO MAPPING

Another task will be mapping the MRO players, understanding their competencies and ensuring this knowledge is shared and used across the continent. Similar work was done a few years back by the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), which hosted the webinar with Diop. Raphael Kuuchi, AFRAA consulting director for government, legal and industry affairs, said this existing African MRO database is available on the AFRAA website.

“Whenever we have technical and operations committee meetings, we try to remind members of the availability of existing MROs and why they need to make use of them,” Kuuchi said.

AFRAA itself is in the pilot phase of a spare-parts pooling initiative. As an element of this, AFRAA and SAA Technical are finalizing an agreement to create a components pool at Johannesburg O.R. Tambo International Airport. “Once the pilot becomes successful, we are looking at replicating that in other regions,” Kuuchi said. “Ethiopian Airlines has already indicated to AFRAA that they would be glad to do something similar using their base in Lome, [Togo], to take care of West Africa.”

Diop believes Airbus can also help with African parts availability. “We don’t want an aeroplane sitting there for days waiting for a part that could have been there within hours, should we have a spares pool available next door,” he said. Diop suggests that Airbus could help AFRAA solve any issues that it hits with the spare-parts pool, or simply step back if the initiative is working well.

The Airbus program head’s main concern is operators accidentally using the wrong part. “It’s very easy to think that ‘a glue is a glue,’ but a glue for one aircraft is not necessarily a glue for another aircraft,” he said. “It’s not for Airbus to come and build warehouses everywhere. It’s about us seeing how we can support these sorts of initiatives using existing warehouses, using existing players, but also, again, coming as a helping hand to make these great initiatives work.”

This will become even more relevant as Africa begins to harness its growth potential. “When we look ahead, we see all the ingredients for a booming market,” Diop said.

Airbus forecasts that the African commercial fleet will quadruple to around 1,200 aircraft over the next 20 years. Around 80% of these will be single-aisles for intra-African flights. However, many African airlines still operate classic-generation aircraft rather than new-generation models. This means there is a huge technology jump from classics to modern technologies such as Airbus A320neos.

SKIPPING A GENERATION

“It’s a straight jump, which is nice to see, but our role is to make sure that we accompany this jump in such a way that the knowledge transfer is also happening,” Diop said. “We need to make sure that this gap is not only understood but also properly staffed.”

The day-to-day focus of African operators means they sometimes lack resources to prepare fully for a new type’s entry into service. “For all our operators, when they take a new aircraft model, we are preparing them to know the aeroplane as early as possible. What we have realized is that for African operators, we have to do a bit more than usual,” Diop said. “We quite often realize after the entry into service that there are some gaps in there.”

Airbus is piloting an initiative to get to know its African airline customers “inside out” before the new aircraft delivery, with the aim of helping them through the initial acceptance process. “It’s not spying on the customer. It’s really to understand what support is needed,” Diop said. In practical terms, the airframer sends “a squad of knowledgeable people” to sit down with the operator and answer any questions, working through regulatory acceptance processes, planned aircraft deployment and warehouse locations.

There are further challenges once the aircraft is in service, because maintenance processes for new-technology aircraft are different from those for classic-generation aircraft. Diop cited the examples of structural damage assessments on metal aircraft versus composite and the increased use of digital tools to monitor performance.

“It’s not the same job anymore,” Diop said. “It is technically different, the tools are different, the assessment is different, and the results may be different on clearing an aeroplane [back into service], for instance. Our role is to make sure not only that this is understood, but that if it needs new skills, new resources, they are there.”

AFRICAN ADVANTAGE

Part of the Airbus African Support Strategy involves technical training, reducing Africa’s dependence on skills from abroad. However, this is where the continent has an advantage. Around 70% of the African population is below 30 years old and very eager to learn.

Diop also sees potential for Airbus to help harmonize training standards. While it is up to African universities to create their own courses, Airbus could facilitate partnerships between those universities, potentially connecting them with similar institutions in Europe.

Another area for development is African countries’ willingness to recognize and accept training from one another so that an aviation professional trained in South Africa can work in West Africa and vice versa. Airbus sees potential for Africa to create a licensing curriculum that is trusted across the whole continent. The OEM is willing to help make that happen, but only if that support is needed or wanted.

Airbus is in discussions with Ethiopian Airlines, which has its own aviation university offering technical training and leadership courses. “I also know that other countries want to do the same; they want to put some degrees in place,” Diop said. “We are in touch with some operators and some training organizations on the continent. The next step is to look at those who want to become training organizations. There’s a lot of willingness from many countries.”

Diop is keen to get the ball rolling, identify where Africa wants help, prioritize those projects and get started.

“We have a small window of time where we can be all convinced that this is worth the gain,” Diop said. “If in five years we haven’t progressed, we will all say: ‘OK, you know what? Let’s let it go. Nobody’s really willing to play the game.’ And I hope this won’t be the case.”"

Western sanctions against Russia have taken a toll on the country's aviation sector — forcing the country to get creative to keep its planes flying.

Quickly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, western countries enacted heavy sanctions against Russia to punish Vladimir Putin.

This included closing US, EU, and other allied airspace, preventing planemakers like Boeing and Airbus from sending spare parts to Russia, and stopping countries like Turkey from refueling Russian planes.

The goal was to cut Russia off from the rest of the world.

In response, the Kremlin countered with its own sanctions. It even went as far as to seize some 500 leased western-built airliners — which are worth an estimated $10 billion, according to Reuters.

Despite many allied nations' attempts to reclaim the Russian-seized aircraft, most lessors have had no choice but to forfeit their planes to Russia due to airspace restrictions and pushback from its government and airlines.

And, the volatile nation continues to prove it's more bulletproof than expected. In 2022, Russia received over $14 million worth western-made parts thanks to underground shipments.

Creating a 'Frankenstein fleet'

Once countries stopped sending parts to Russian carriers like Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, the companies were forced to find new suppliers. Some bought second-hand from places like Iran and China, while others ""cannibalized"" existing jets.

However, robbing spare parts could make the resulting ""Frankenstein fleet"" worthless outside of Russia's borders, and lessors have since written off the aircraft without much hope they'll ever see them again.

Moreover, the potentially un-airworthy parts could create unnecessary safety risks. Not to mention, once airline inventory gets low, some carrier could encourage pilots and mechanics to purposely overlook certain repairs — similar to what Aeroflot reportedly did earlier this year.

Buying off seized jets using rainy-day money

Since Russia seized hundreds of planes, airplane leasing companies have filed multi-billion dollar insurance claims to recoup lost money — though many are being denied by insurers.

Nevertheless, some lessors may actually get a check directly from the Kremlin.

Last week, Russian media outlet TASS reported the government has allotted 300 billion rubles (about $4 billion) from Russia's National Wealth Fund — essentially its rainy day money — to buy off 80-90 of the foreign-made aircraft it seized from lessors.

Leasing companies in the EU are able to accept the payment thanks to a sanction amendment that says aircraft ownership can be transferred to Russian airlines if a lease agreement was signed prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and only after all of the lease payments have been made.

Airlines including Aeroflot, S7, Ural Airlines, RusLine, and iFly have finalizing agreements, Aerotime Hub reported, but are still waiting on their NWF funds. Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has already received a portion of the money for 10 Boeing 777-300ERs.

According to TASS, Russia's deputy minister of transport Igor Chalik said he is uncertain of when exactly airlines will receive the federal funds, but noted ""our task is to complete this program in any case by the end of September.""

As of July 1, Russia's NWF stood at $145.6 billion — down from $153.1 billion on June 1, according to country's Ministry of Finance."
A stellar career - Airbus,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LWEtc3RlbGxhci1jYXJlZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beginning as an engineer at Airbus Helicopters, Sophie Adenot’s career has been exceptional from the very start. Subsequently becoming a helicopter pilot and then the first woman to be a helicopter test pilot in the French military, the next phase of her career should take her into outer space - having stood out from a pool of 22,350 candidates, she recently embarked upon a training programme to become a European Space Agency astronaut.

Despite her rigorous schedule, Sophie participated in France’s annual July 14th military parade, piloting a very majestic H160 in formation with other seminal members of the Airbus Helicopters family. In anticipation of the event, she shared with us her passion for flight and her remarkable career path that is paving its way towards the stars.

Did you always want to be a test pilot and astronaut, or did your ambitions evolve as your career advanced?

SA: Yes, I wanted to become a test pilot and astronaut since I was a little girl - it's a dream that has never changed. What evolved throughout my career was developing the self-confidence to be able to actually try to make these dreams come true. It was initially challenging for me to give direction to my career path. Although I knew what I ultimately wanted, I rarely knew if the most recent choice I made for my career was the right one. As I gained experience, I learned to listen more to my intuition.

The idea of being a helicopter pilot was always fascinating to me, even from when I was very young. We can explore speed ranges from zero to 315 km/h. We can carry out a whole range of missions, including winching, search and rescue, transportation, and going to the mountains or the sea.

In the end, I never imagined I would have such a packed career. I started as an engineer at Airbus Helicopters. Then I tried a new challenge - becoming a helicopter pilot, then another - becoming a helicopter test pilot, and then a new one… Had anyone told me that I actually would end up here today, I would never have believed it.

You began your career with Airbus Helicopters - what was your role and how did it help you prepare for your future?

SA: Being an engineer at Airbus Helicopters in 2004 was my first job right after my aeronautics & astronautics studies at SUPAERO and MIT. I was fascinated by helicopters. I felt lucky to have an opportunity to work with teams in the design office. I worked on the design of the H225 cockpit, particularly the implementation of the EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System) and the TCAS (Traffic Collision Alert System). It was challenging, because at that time, they had never been implemented in helicopters. Now, this system is fully operational and enhances flight safety.

Tell us about your experience piloting the H160.

SA: Safety has been enhanced with the H160. Many new innovations and technologies have been integrated. A camera on the tail films from the rear, showing the exterior of the helicopter so the pilot can always see every obstacle around them. The glass cockpit means the pilot has a constant overview and understanding allowing them to concentrate fully on the particular mission that they might be flying. It’s a game-changer in terms of the missions, the piloting and the comfort of the passengers.

As a pilot and test engineer, what innovations do you think will be important for helicopters in the future?

SA: First, I value all steps which will contribute to enhancing flight safety. Airbus has many innovative ideas on this topic. It is challenging, and the effort is worthwhile. Second, today, we are all concerned with the climate crisis. I know Airbus is already working hard on this topic, doing research and testing equipment to help reach IATA’s net zero CO2 emission objective by 2050. We need to gather all forms of intelligence because our true challenge is to leave a sustainable planet for future generations. Third, as I have a passion for human-machine interaction and cockpit design, I hope many innovations will change the future of cockpit design, to help crew members with decision-making, situation awareness, flying skills, handling emergencies in uncertain situations. I will be keeping a keen eye on any advances in this area.

You are the second French woman to participate in ESA’s astronaut programme. Can you tell us a little bit about what is involved?

SA: We learn a lot of theory to learn how to operate the system, normal and emergency procedures, and maintenance, like plumbing and electricity on the space station. Our primary role is to contribute to science and research. Thus, we also learn the fundamental theory to be able to perform experiments because for the majority of our time, we are researchers in this flying laboratory. We also learn how to treat injured colleagues with first aid and stitches - in space, we need to be completely autonomous even in the medical sector.

What does it mean to you to play a part in the July 14th celebrations?

SA: I am very happy to share my enthusiasm with hundreds of men and women who share the same values for France’s freedom and democracy, as well as their passion for aeronautics and astronautics.

This year, for the 14th of July, I will be in the H160 from Airbus Helicopters, in a formation flight with my former colleagues from the French Air and Space Force. I’ll be wearing my blue astronaut flight suit. It will be the intersection of the three institutions I have dedicated my career to: Airbus Helicopters, the French Air and Space Force and the European Space Agency.

A year in review: the Airbus Foundation in 2022 - Airbus,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LWEteWVhci1pbi1yZXZpZXctdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWluLTIwMjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following the recent publication of the 2022 Airbus Foundation Impact Report, we asked Rachel Schroeder, Airbus Foundation Managing Director, to reflect on her 2022 highlights and the strategic priorities for the Foundation.

What were the key highlights for the Foundation in 2022?

We had a very busy year in 2022 across all three of our focus areas. In Humanitarian Response, the Foundation provided 12 relief flights, delivering more than 175 tonnes of aid, and responded to almost 80 requests for satellite imagery from our NGO partners, helping them to inform their crisis response.

Our Youth initiatives spanned 17 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and reached 9,000 students. Not only did we deliver fresh content, but we also made that content more accessible by launching the new Airbus Foundation Discovery Space platform in four languages.

We’ve expanded the scope of our Environmental work by partnering with Association Océan Polaire and planning the provision of technical support for their pioneering Polar POD mission. Under the leadership of renowned French explorer and scientist Jean-Louis Etienne, Polar POD is a maritime expedition that will collect environmental and climate data in the Southern Ocean.

We also expanded our work with our existing partners Connected Conservation Foundation (CCF) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), helping to protect biodiversity and monitor forest reforestation.

I’m very proud of our team's commitment delivering these programmes and the way they have stepped up to support our partners during busy times.

Over the past year, the Foundation has worked with more NGOs than ever before. What makes for a successful partnership?

A successful partnership is a collaboration of two parties with shared values, working together to achieve shared goals and make a positive impact. The Foundation offers our NGO partners a diverse range of products and services that help them tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems. When we get to know one another and collaborate in an atmosphere of trust, we can achieve great things. This can take time, but we are committed to cultivating enduring partnerships.

What are the biggest strategic priorities for the Foundation going forward?

Following our recent Annual Board meeting, I am happy to say that Airbus has renewed its commitment to the Foundation for a further five years.

Our Humanitarian efforts continue to be of paramount importance, as the demand for assistance rises due to geopolitical tension, global economic challenges and climate-related issues. Many of these requests originate from regions that have disappeared from the headlines, as their humanitarian crises have transitioned from acute to chronic. We will be exploring how we can increase our support in such areas of protracted crises.

We will also re-evaluate and refresh our Youth programmes to ensure we support the communities most in need of our help. According to UNICEF, the number of children displaced due to humanitarian crises has reached a new high of over 43 million. These children are being robbed of a proper education and a better future. In the future, we want our Youth programme to focus on children who don’t have access to basic education and development support.

When it comes to our Environment work, we now have three distinct partnerships and programmes: work with CCF to protect endangered species and their habitats, forest mapping and restoration with IUCN, and our newest project with Association Océan Polaire to better understand the environment and climate change through the Polar POD mission.

As we embark on our second year of dedicated work in this area, I am truly encouraged by the strides we have already made in achieving our objectives. Together with our partners, we have the potential to make a really tangible difference.

SMILE! One step closer to space weather forecasting - Airbus,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LXNtaWxlLW9uZS1zdGVwLWNsb3Nlci10by1zcGFjZS13ZWF0aGVyLWZvcmVjYXN0aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The SMILE spacecraft is expected to revolutionise the understanding of the physical processes that drive space weather. These are generated by the continuous interaction between particles in the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, or magnetic shield. This is a region of space dominated by our planet's magnetic field that shields us from much of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. However, some particles manage to penetrate this shield by reaching the ionosphere, leading to space weather effects that include, of course, the beautiful northern lights and geomagnetic storms which can also lead to direct impact of electrical equipment on Earth.

Teams from Airbus, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS/IAMC) have succeeded in getting the qualification model of the Chinese platform and the electrical-functional model of the European payload module (PLM) of the SMILE (Solar-wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer) satellite to communicate with each other seamlessly at the Airbus facility in Madrid-Barajas. This is no mean feat, considering that each element is built in very different and separate environments and that so far the tests that have been performed (thermo-structural modelling) did not involve communication between the two systems.

""We have just connected the European payload module and the Chinese platform and it’s good news: the platform has switched on our Extended Control Unit (ECU) and the PLM application software has started. It’s also great to see the teams working so well together and ESA's satisfaction with the progress made"", said Javier Sánchez Palma, SMILE programme manager at Airbus in Spain.

This test marked the start of the mission critical design review (CDR) held in Shanghai from 26 to 29 June which was declared successful. This moves forward the integration of the flight models of both systems (platform and PLM).

THE MISSION OF SMILE

SMILE is a joint mission between Europe and China in which Airbus is responsible for the European component (the payload module) and CAS is responsible for manufacturing the satellite platform. Difficulties encountered along the way obviously include language and the serious problems caused by the pandemic since 2019, when ESA's science programme committee gave the green light to this new mission to explore Sun-Earth interaction.

SMILE will collect remote sensing (X-ray) measurements of the interaction of solar wind ions with neutral atoms in the Earth's exosphere, the outer layer of our atmosphere. This particle collision generates characteristic soft X-ray emissions, so it will be possible to determine more precisely the areas of influence such as the particle collision arc (currently estimated to be about 90 000 kilometres away), the magnetopause and the polar cusps, thanks to the wavelengths of the X-rays.

This data will be complemented by data from existing ground and space-based observatories, including ESA's Cluster and Swarm missions, led by Airbus, which investigate the magnetic space environment around the Earth.

Airbus has long been involved in projects relating to the Sun, having launched the Airbus-built Ulysses probe in 1990 to study the solar wind from high solar latitudes. Five years later, the special ESA/NASA SOHO observatory, also led by Airbus, was put into orbit at L1 (Lagrange 1), which monitors the Sun's coronal ejections by measuring the speed of the solar wind 1.5 million kilometres from our planet one hour before it reaches the Earth. Hence the importance of this satellite, which was designed with a three-year lifetime and is still active. In addition, Solar Orbiter, launched in 2020, addresses the questions of: how does the Sun create and control the heliosphere? and what drives the solar wind and where does the coronal magnetic field originate from?

THE RISKS OF SPACE WEATHER

All these efforts to learn more about space weather are aimed at mitigating its impact on Earth, as it represents a danger both to human health on the Earth's surface and to satellites and astronauts in orbit.

Since the 19th century, the solar wind has been of great interest due to its implications for our planet because it causes phenomena such as geomagnetic storms, which today can damage communications and power systems on Earth and damage electronic equipment. For example, solar storms can affect mobile phones and other electronic devices as these energetic solar particles interfere with radio signals and satellite communications, affecting the quality of phone calls and internet connectivity.

The more we learn about space weather, the more we see that modern technology is highly vulnerable to its effects. Auroras cause electrical currents that can disrupt power grids and corrode pipes. Geomagnetic storms also affect high-frequency communications and satellite navigation (GPS, Galileo, etc.), as energetic solar particles can damage spacecraft electronics and optical systems.

However, the influence of the solar wind transcends our planet and reaches beyond the orbit of Pluto. It is not surprising that the plasma in the tails of comets always point away from the Sun.

Bartolomeo – The Easy Way of Bringing Payloads to the ISS - Airbus,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTA3LWJhcnRvbG9tZW8tdGhlLWVhc3ktd2F5LW9mLWJyaW5naW5nLXBheWxvYWRzLXRvLXRoZS1pc3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"‘When it comes to making access to Space easier and more affordable, why not resort to an established infrastructure that already exists?’ This is one of the questions Airbus engineers asked themselves when they started looking at how they could make the many benefits of Space-based activities accessible to a wider community.

Turns out: The International Space Station (ISS) - one of (if not the) most reliable assets humanity has in Space today - offers just that. “When we first started thinking about Bartolomeo, we soon saw that while payload space on the ISS was available and well-used especially for agency-backed research, we were not exploiting the station’s full potential,” says Christian Steimle, now Head of the Bartolomeo Programme at Airbus Space. “So we started looking at how we could establish both additional infrastructure and a commercial service, which would enable more flexibility, a faster time-to-orbit, greater affordability and simpler processes.”

The result: The Bartolomeo platform and the related All-in-One Space Mission Service. This external payload hosting facility, named after the younger brother of Christopher Columbus, was built by Airbus in Bremen and installed on the outside of the ISS’ European Columbus Module at the very front of the space station. ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer completed its installation by establishing a final cable connection in March 2022 and the platform is ‘open for business’.

The team has since added the ArgUS Multi-Payload Carrier to the portfolio, a payload accommodation plate built by the Airbus team in Houston and ready to host up to 10 smaller payloads within one standard payload slot.

#NextSpace at Its Best

Without even knowing it at the time, the team developed what we could call one of Airbus Space’s very early #NextSpace topics – which goes to show that what we call #NextSpace is not just a theoretical concept, but reflects real developments in the Space domain. And in a way shows that the much-evoked division between ‘New Space’ and ‘Old Space’ is artificial.

“Bartolomeo is for everyone,” says Steimle. New entrants and established players from around the globe appreciate that on Bartolomeo, flying a LEO mission becomes comparatively easy and affordable, and this is reflected by the customer base: “We are looking at a quite healthy mix of customers,” he says. “Of course, Space Agencies welcome the opportunity of this additional payload space, but we have also signed up commercial customers and research organizations – and some capacity remains.”

First Payload Launches in 2023

With first payloads being launched and installed on the Bartolomeo platform in the course of 2023, what was once no more than a vision of a small group of engineers from Bremen, Germany, is now becoming a firm reality.

Some Examples of Payloads Slated to Fly on Bartolomeo

The very first payload on the Bartolomeo platform is the Multi-Needle Langmuir Probe (m-NLP), currently the only instrument in the world capable of resolving ionospheric plasma density variations at spatial scales below one metre. This probe, coming from the University of Oslo and Eidsvoll Electronics (Norway) and supported by the European Space Agency (ESA), benefits from the relatively low orbit of the ISS, which puts it near the peak plasma density of the ionosphere. The m-NLP payload will occupy a standard slot for more than three years.

The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Exobiology Platform mission consists of a set of radiation experiments aimed at better understanding the evolution of organic molecules and organisms in space and will occupy a standard slot for 36 months.

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has booked a double slot for its 18-month COMPASSO mission. It is the first in-orbit verification of compact and highly stable laser-optical clocks with a bi-directional optical link to compare and synchronize with highly stable clocks on Earth.

As part of UNOOSA’s ‘Access to Space 4 All’ initiative, Airbus is providing an ArgUS slot on its 2024 sortie for the ClimCam, a remote sensing camera system dedicated to Climate Change monitoring East Africa. This free-of-charge slot is occupied by the EKU Consortium comprising the Space Agencies of Egypt, Kenya and Uganda.

The first ArgUS Mission, carrying several payloads within one standard slot, is slated for late 2023 and will carry payloads from Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA.

For more complex Space missions, customers can draw on Airbus’ decades-long experience and contract design and engineering services to ensure their mission success. “We are currently discussing a number of additional payloads,” says Steimle. “Some are more or less good to go, while for others, our experts are working very closely with the customer to assess feasibility and define how we can best support them en route to orbit.”

New additional payloads include technology demonstrations, in-orbit verification missions, in-space manufacturing and 3D printing approaches, to name but a few. “That is what makes work on the Bartolomeo service so exciting for us,” Steimle says: “We are able to cover a wide array of missions in a relatively small space, and each and every one of them is exciting. It is a great opportunity for us at Airbus Space to apply our decades of experience and help our customers make their mission a reality.”

A Commercial Service for Today and Tomorrow

And what does the future hold for Bartolomeo? “The ISS will continue to operate for a number of years yet,” says Steimle, “and as will Bartolomeo. But we are already working with potential partners for the time beyond: There are a number of organizations and private companies working on the next generation of LEO stations, many with a much more service-based approach than today’s station. Airbus is strongly engaged in such initiatives, and we are convinced that a Bartolomeo-like service will continue to exist, and even continue to grow.”"
Pegasus Airlines Orders 36 Additional Airbus A321neos - Aviation Week,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvcGVnYXN1cy1haXJsaW5lcy1vcmRlcnMtMzYtYWRkaXRpb25hbC1haXJidXMtYTMyMW5lb3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkey’s LCC Pegasus Airlines has ordered 36 additional Airbus A321neos, according to a Public Disclosure Platform (KAP) announcement on Thursday, June 13 and in a statement on July 14.

“In line with our fleet planning strategy targeting a young fleet with low fuel consumption, low unit-cost performance and low carbon emissions, we’ve reached an agreement with Airbus S.A.S. to amend the Airbus order,” Pegasus said in the KAP.

Based at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen Airport, Pegasus initially executed the order in 2012 and later amended it in 2017, 2021 and 2022 to cover a total of 114 new aircraft.

As a result, the original order for 100 A320/321neo family aircraft, placed by Pegasus with Airbus in 2012, has now been extended to a total of 150 aircraft. Among these, 108 are A321neos, the airline said July 14.

“We embarked on our journey with the belief that everyone has the right to fly, and today, we remain equally dedicated to operational efficiency, financial performance, and sustainability for our industry and the world,” Pegasus Airlines CEO Güliz Öztürk said July 14.

“Through our recent agreement with Airbus, by adding 36 new 239-seater A321neos, we will both expand and modernize our fleet.”

The delivery of the 36 A321neos is expected to take place at the end of 2029.

Pegasus mentions it has the youngest fleet in Turkey with an average age of 4.5 years. “In addition to our fleet transformation with new generation aircraft, we are moving toward this goal through our operational efficiency efforts, increasing our use of sustainable aviation fuel and our focus on alternative energy sources,” the CEO said.

Pegasus expects to take delivery of its 100th aircraft around the third quarter of 2023. “By the end of this year, we plan on operating 108 aircraft,” Pegasus CEO Güliz Öztürk told Aviation Daily recently.

“We are also working on the project to establish our own hangar at Sabiha Gokcen, which generates 66% of our total traffic,” she said. About two-thirds of its fleet are based in Sabiha Gokcen. Other bases include Ankara, Antalya, Izmir and Northern Cyprus.

According to Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database, Pegasus operates eight Airbus A320ceos, 46 A320neos, 31 A321neos and 14 Boeing 737-800s. The 737 fleet is expected to be phased out by 2025.

Pegasus has an extensive network in Europe and Turkey, but is also well-established in the Middle East.

Europe's Airbus on Wednesday posted higher-than-expected underlying operating profit for the second quarter and reaffirmed financial goals for the year, while removing an interim industrial target on the route to record jet output.

The world's largest planemaker said adjusted earnings before interest and tax rose 34% to 1.845 billion euros ($2.04 billion)as revenues grew 24% to 15.9 billion euros, buoyed by higher jet deliveries.

Analysts had forecast quarterly operating profit of 1.725 billion euros on revenues of 15.867 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.

Airbus said it was ""progressing well"" towards a widely watched production goal for its best-selling A320neo-family jets of 75 jets a month in 2026, which it reaffirmed.

But it withdrew any public mention of a previously stated interim goal of 65 a month by end-2024.

Tactical adjustments will be made as required to meet the ultimate 75-per-month rate, ""which is now the key reference point for the company and the supply chain,"" Airbus said.

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied the decision to retire the interim target from the company's official releases signaled any lack of confidence in its production plans.

He said the 65-a-month target - slightly above what Airbus was producing before the pandemic - had been an important milestone in post-COVID recovery that was no longer relevant.

However some suppliers were surprised by the decision to remove the target. Airbus told them during the Paris Airshow last month that it saw ""no change"" to its goals, they said.

One senior supplier said the decision would not help Airbus' credibility as it encourages suppliers to hire and invest.

Industry sources say Airbus is producing about 47 narrow-body A320neo-family jets a month, below an internal planning rate of 55 a month that it had aimed for by mid-2023.

Airbus reaffirmed production plans for other models."

The airline also finalized long-term lease agreements with SMBC Aviation Capital for four new A321LRs, which will join its fleet starting in 2024.

The move marks a shift for the North Atlantic operator. Its current fleet is made up of Boeing aircraft including 737-8s and 9s, older 757-200s, 757-300s and 767-300ERs, as well as De Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprops on regional routes.

Under the new agreement with Airbus, Icelandair has a firm order for 13 A321XLRs and purchase rights for up to 12 additional aircraft. Deliveries will start in 2029.

The A321XLR completed its first flight in 2022 and is due to enter service in 2024 as the longest-range single-aisle aircraft in production, with a range of 4,700 nm.

The financing of the aircraft is yet to be determined but the airline will explore financing options closer to the delivery dates, Icelandair said July 6.

The lease agreements with SMBC Aviation Capital apply to four new A321LR aircraft, scheduled to be delivered from Airbus in the fourth quarter of 2024.

“A321XLR aircraft will further strengthen our business model, increase our flexibility, and provide opportunities for future growth, as well as further support our sustainability efforts,” Icelandair President and CEO Bogi Nils Bogason said."

Why Icelandair selected the Airbus A321XLR to replace Boeing 757 - Flightradar24 Blog,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodHJhZGFyMjQuY29tL2Jsb2cvaWNlbGFuZGFpci1vcmRlcnMtYTMyMXhsci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Icelandic flag carrier Icelandair (FI/ICE) has announced a confirmed order for 13 Airbus A321XLR jets. Whilst the A321XLR is set to be certified in 2024, the first aircraft delivered to Icelandair is expected to enter service in 2029. The carrier has also announced its intention to lease 4 Airbus A321LR aircraft from SMBC Aviation Capital.

Why replace the the Boeing 757-200 with the A321XLR?

The total number of aircraft involved in today’s announcement matches Icelandair’s existing fleet of 17 Boeing 757-200 aircraft. The 757-200 forms the backbone of the fleet, and the investment in Airbus aircraft confirms the A321XLR as the replacement product. Operators have been reluctant to let go of their ageing 757 fleets in recent years due to the lack of a replacement that could match its performance, range and capacity.

The upcoming certification of the A321XLR presents operators with a new generation aircraft that can match the 757’s performance whilst cutting down on fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The A321XLR presents 3 key benefits over the 757.

Range – The A321XLR can fly around 800 nautical miles further than the 757-200. Capacity – The A321XLR’s maximum passenger capacity in single class configuration is less than the 757, but higher in the two class configuration as is currently used by Icelandair. Icelandair’s 757-200 aircraft currently seat 184 passengers in two classes, whereas the A321XLR fitted with the ‘Airspace Cabin’ will typically seat around 220. Sustainability – Though figures are not yet available for the A321XLR, the currently available A321LR represents up to a 19% CO2 saving per seat per kilometer compared to a Boeing 757-200 on a similar sector according to data from IBA NetZero.

Despite these clear advantages, it is unlikely that this order was placed out of any affinity for Airbus. 87% of the Icelandair fleet is made up of Boeing aircraft, and it is likely that a Boeing product would have been preferred by the airline if it was available (it is common for airlines to stick to one manufacturer to simplify operations and cut down on training costs). As it stands, Boeing has no planned replacement for the 757 after no progress was made on the ‘New Midsized Airplane’ (NMA) project, leaving the A321XLR as the only appropriate product on the market.

Icelandair‘s 757 fleet have played host to some interesting liveries in recent years, including the beautiful ‘Hekla Aurora’. Do you think any special liveries will make their way to the new A321 fleet?"

To celebrate, let’s take a closer look at the future of lunar exploration with Achim Seidel, an Airbus engineer who works on Roxy, an industrial process that could one day provide all the essentials necessary to sustain human life on the Moon.

Achim, why is it a good idea for humans to settle on the Moon?

There are as many good reasons as there are craters on the Moon! One of the most obvious ones is that the Moon is an ideal stepping stone for us to venture even further into space: due to its low gravitational pull, the energy required to launch deep-space missions is much lower. But before we can do that, we need to establish a lunar ecosystem where people can live long term by using local resources. Enabling this will lead to a raft of new technologies that could also benefit life on Earth, which is very exciting.

What are the essential elements for human lunar settlement?

Just like on Earth, we need to make sure that there is enough oxygen for humans to breathe and water to drink. These two are our highest priority. Metals and alloys follow, as these would be necessary to construct buildings, habitats and structures, as well as wires and raw materials for manufacturing satellites in deep space.

How is Airbus helping make this happen?

Transporting key elements of life such as oxygen, water and metals to the Moon would be far too expensive. To make things economically viable, they would have to be produced locally on the Moon. We call this concept ISRU, short for in-situ resource utilisation. We are currently developing technologies and systems that are capable of doing exactly that. Our Roxy (Regolith to OXYgen and Metals Conversion) process is a showcase example: it uses regolith, the dust on the surface of the moon, to produce these key resources in a highly efficient manner. This limits the need for expensive supply deliveries from Earth.

When will all this become reality?

Roxy is currently in the lab stage and has already produced oxygen and metals in a demonstration here on Earth. On the Moon, we’ve designed the project to have three stages. First, we plan to build a lunar demonstrator by 2026-27 that would be capable of producing a few grams of oxygen from regolith in one lunar day (28 Earth days). In the second stage, planned for around 2030, a pilot plant would produce 500 kilograms of oxygen per year. This pilot plant could support lunar missions by providing oxygen for life support. In the final stage, the plant would become operational in the second half of the 2030s and produce about 50 tons of oxygen per year, which would be used for living quarters and in space suits.The plant would also produce metals that could be used as construction materials, and could even produce rocket fuel to propel spacecraft to Mars and Earth.

How will life on Earth benefit from all this?

On Earth, Roxy could be used to reduce emissions from metals production through a carbon-free energy carrier cycle. In this process, iron powder produced by Roxy would be used as an energy carrier. When the iron powder burns, it turns into iron oxide without producing carbon dioxide. Roxy could then be used to recycle the iron oxide back to iron, producing high-purity oxygen as a valuable by-product."
Is Azul Retiring Its Airbus A350 Fleet? - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYXp1bC10by1yZXRpcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZmxlZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS — Azul Linhas Aéreas (AD), Brazil’s largest low-cost carrier, plans to phase out its fleet of Airbus A350 aircraft after less than one year of operations, according to local Brazilian media Aeroin.

The airline has updated its Campinas Viracopos Airport (VCP) slots, and the last flight of the type looks scheduled for October 28, 2023, from VCP to Orlando (MCO), marking the end of a very short era in the airline’s fleet history.

Azul planned to introduce five -900 series airframes in 2017. However, after constant delays, the first unit arrived as late as September 2022.

The last arrival of the Azul A350 to Paris-Orly Airport is expected to happen on October 2, 2023. Photo: Paris Aéroport.

Azul’s A350 Story

Azul’s interest in the Airbus A350-900 began in 2014 when the carrier signed a dry-lease contract with ILFC for five airframes. This deal was canceled in 2017, and the reserved units were transferred to the Chinese carrier Hong Kong Airlines (HX), which operated both jets until the COVID-19 outbreak, forcing their grounding.

Airframes PR-AOW (MSN 168) and PR-AOY (MSN 124) were ferried to the French aircraft storage facilities at Tarbes Airport (LDE). They remained here until AD chose to reincorporate both units in September and December 2022.

After three months of crew and maintenance training, PR-AOW and PR-AOY were put to work on routes from Campinas (VCP) to Paris (ORY), Lisbon (LIS), and Orlando (MCO), among others.

Two other A350s, with MSN 098 and 112, that once were destined for the Brazilian LCC were transferred to Hainan Airlines (HU) and, at the end of 2022, have found a new customer, Iberia (IB).

Although fuel efficiency is worse, maintenance costs of the A330 are lower than the ones of the Airbus A350. Photo: Otto Kirchof/Airways

An Early Goodbye to the Flagship

Azul Linhas Aéreas is one of the most successful low-cost carriers in the history of Brazil. Being the airline with the country’s most extensive domestic air network, it has recently given itself a try in the challenging transatlantic market.

AD owns and operates a fleet of nine Airbus A330 family jets, including five of the next-generation A330-900neo variant. The strategy of Azul in low-cost travel has made the airline record revenues in Q1 2023.

However, according to local media, the Airbus A350 aircraft has not adapted well to the methodology of AD regarding cost efficiency. Azul sees the A350 as an airplane with very high maintenance and operational cost, even though it has some of the best fuel burn performances in the industry.

No official confirmation has been received from the company regarding the true reason, context, and consequences of the types of retirement.

Viva Aerobus Expands Fleet With Airbus Order - FLYING,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vdml2YS1hZXJvYnVzLWV4cGFuZHMtZmxlZXQtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Viva Aerobus, Mexico’s low-cost airline, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus to expand the carrier’s fleet.

According to Juan Carlos Zuazua, CEO of Viva Aerobus, the company has placed an order for 90 A321neo aircraft, bringing its total order of A320 family aircraft to 170.

“These 90 A321neo 240-seater aircraft will allow us to grow and renew our fleet and remain the youngest in Latin America,” said Zuazua. “The technology and operational efficiency of the A321neos will improve our operational reliability, on-time performance, and provide an unmatched passenger experience. Additionally, we expect to drive further cost savings, which will reflect in lower airfares and strengthen one of our most important advantages: having the lowest cost in the Americas. The fuel-efficiency and noise reduction that the A321neo provides will advance our sustainability efforts by delivering immediate, tangible carbon-emission reductions, thus enhancing our position as the most efficient airline in the continent.”

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ A320neo family. According to the company, the combination of new generation engines and Sharklets gives the A321neo “a 50 percent noise reduction and more than a 20 percent fuel savings compared to previous single-aisle generation aircraft.”

Viva Aerobus is a longtime Airbus customer. In 2013, the airline placed an order for 52 A320 family aircraft, which was the largest Airbus order placed by a single airline in Mexico at the time. In 2018, the airline ordered 25 A321neo aircraft. To date, Viva Aerobus operates 74 A320 family aircraft.



According to Airbus, the company has sold more than 1,150 aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean, representing a market share of nearly 60 percent of in-service passenger aircraft."

Mexican carrier Viva Aerobus signs deal with Airbus for 90 A321neo aircraft - AeroTime,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdml2YS1hZXJvYnVzLWFpcmJ1cy1uZW8tYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXLSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL3ZpdmEtYWVyb2J1cy1haXJidXMtbmVvLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVyL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mexican ultra-low-cost airline Viva Aerobus and aircraft giant Airbus have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for 90 Airbus A321neo aircraft.

The huge aircraft deal announced on July 5, 2023, brings the airline’s order with Airbus to 170 A320 family aircraft.

Viva Aerobus has based its fleet renewal strategy on the A320 family. In 2013, the airline placed an order for 52 A320 aircraft, the largest Airbus aircraft order placed by a single airline in Mexico at the time.

This was followed in 2018 with a deal for 25 A321neo aircraft. To date, Viva Aerobus operates 74 A320 family aircraft.

Viva Aerobus has also selected Pratt & Whitney GTF engines to power the additional 90 Airbus aircraft orders, the first of which is expected to be delivered in 2027.

“The Mexican leisure market is in full recovery mode and Viva Aerobus is at the center of the action! The unbeatable economics of the A321neo make it the perfect choice for the airline’s ultra-low cost model. We are pleased to have been a partner with the airline since 2013 and look forward to working together as it continues on its growth trajectory,” said Christian Scherer, CCO and head of Airbus International.

Airbus has sold over 1,150 aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 750 are in operation throughout the region, with another 500 in the order backlog, representing a market share of nearly 60% of in-service passenger aircraft.

Since 1994, Airbus has secured 75% of net orders in the region."
"Airbus comes full C Series circle with A220 Airspace cabin, bins - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtYWlyc3BhY2UtYmlucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you are old enough to remember when the spacious, bright and modern cabin on the Bombardier C Series (now Airbus A220) was part of the drivers for the European airframer to upgrade its narrowbody cabins with the Airspace brand, your author invites you to sit down on the proverbial porch rocking chair and contemplate the new A220 Airspace cabins.

The primary change to the A220 is overhead, with the sweeping upwards curved pivot bins of the C Series (which is how we’ll refer to the current cabin) giving way to a large flip-up bin along the lines of that used for the A320neo Airspace cabin. Demonstrated at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in June, the overall A220 Airspace aesthetic, in essence, “Airbusifies” the cabin, bringing it in line — in look and feel (and bag space) — with the rest of the Airbus narrowbodies on the market.

The new bins, to be manufactured by Diehl Aviation, are officially called the Airspace XL Bin for the A220. They’re lighter by some 300lbs (nearly 140kg) than what they replace, differently shaped, and change the frame structure to a four-frame design.

“You have more space in here — twenty percent more space,” Airbus vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer tells Runway Girl Network. “It’s easier to handle, especially for crew. That was always our feedback: that the crew has issues to always close that [bin] if you have a lot of cycles. That’s why this solution is easier, lighter, [with] more volume.”

The new bins increase capacity by up to 19 large pieces of hand luggage, and indeed the new Airspace XL Bins can themselves accommodate larger hand luggage end-in compared with the C Series bins. Airbus also says they are more reliable, lighter weight, and easier to use for passengers — and crew, from whom Wuggetzer says there have been complaints when it comes to closing the pivot bins when full of luggage.

Moving the A220 cabin to flip-up bins, Wuggetzer says, “we optimised that in terms of volume, and integrated that in, of course, the geometry of the A220.”

Linefit starts in 2025, while the transition and cutover from the old bins to the new bins, and how that transition proceeds, depends on airlines’ decisions, but Wuggetzer says that “usually that takes two to three years”.

A key question for Airbus — and indeed for airlines — is how the shape of the A220 Airspace bins proves to be visually and functionally pleasing or effective compared with the C Series versions. Sitting in the aisle seat of the two-seat side of the aircraft, it felt like the overhang was quite substantially off to the right-hand side of the passenger, which added some privacy but was a little unwieldy as a taller (6’3”, 190cm) passenger.

On the three-seat side, meanwhile, the low-hanging bin edge ended roughly halfway over your author’s head, and not especially far away. This was quite the unusual feeling, and one that felt a little disconcerting in a way — half covered by the bin, half not.

We will, perhaps, have to wait for a full-cabin mockup and not just a four-row stand experience, for a final judgment on this one.

“Feedback so far was very positive”, Wuggetzer reports, while he also had good news for passengers concerned about the highly comfortable five-abreast A220 cabin turning into a very tight six-abreast cabin, along the lines of what happened with the BAe 146/Avro RJ-85.

“I’ve not even thought about it,” quipping that “maybe you’ve inspired me!”, but noting that this is a “solution that is based on five-abreast”.

The A220 Airspace cabin also comes with a redesigned ceiling with an optional new LED light under the bins, as well as a new passenger service unit that is manufactured by Astronics.

All the fundamental intellectual property involved throughout the A220 Airspace project, Wuggetzer says, belongs to Airbus.

In its report published on July 26, 2023, Airbus confirmed that its orders, after cancellation, stood at 1,044 aircraft, while last year at the same time only 259 aircraft were agreed.

IndiGo set the stage at this year’s Paris Air Show by placing a remarkable order for 500 Airbus A320-family aircraft.

While Air India purchased 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle planes, along with 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 wide-body jets.

“During the first half of 2023 we progressed well across our businesses in an operational environment that remains complex. Our commercial aircraft are in strong demand, as demonstrated by more than 800 orders announced at the Paris Air Show. This demand is driven both by growth and fleet replacement as airlines invest in more fuel-efficient fleets,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. “Based on this H1 performance, we maintain our 2023 guidance.”

At the end of June 2023, the order backlog at Airbus amounted to a record 7,967 commercial aircraft

Additionally, Airbus Helicopters registered 131 net orders (H1 2022: 163 units) which were well spread across programs and included 19 H160s.

Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value in the first six months of 2023 was €6.0 billion ($6.6 billion) while over the same period in 2022 the value was €6.5 billion ($7.2 billion).

These new figures include four new-build and five converted A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft for Canada.

Consolidated revenues increased 11% year-on-year to €27.7 billion ($30.8 billion).

A total of 316 commercial aircraft were delivered (H1 2022: 297 aircraft), comprising 25 A220s, 256 A320 Family, 14 A330s and 21 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 16 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries.

Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries increased to 145 units (H1 2022: 115 units), mainly driven by the Light helicopter segment. The Division’s revenues rose 16% mainly reflecting a solid performance across programs and services.

Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 8%, mainly driven by delays in Space Systems and delivery phasing in Military Air Systems.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted was € 2,618 million ($2,915 million), while half year one in 2022 this stood at €2,645 million ($2,834 million).

The ramp up on the A220 program is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in the middle of the decade.

On the A320 family program, production is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026.

On the A321XLR, the flight test program is progressing towards the expected entry-into-service in Q2 2024.

On widebody aircraft, Airbus continues to target a monthly rate of four for the A330 in 2024 and a rate of nine for the A350 at the end of 2025."

Now, after killing off its own super-sized passenger plane in 2021, Airbus has brought production of its bonkers looking Beluga cargo plane to an end this week.

Airbus ending production of the Beluga XL is a little different as it only planned to build six of the aircraft, while the A380 was killed off long before Airbus could reach the lofty delivery targets it dreamed of. But it’s still a landmark moment for big planes everywhere.

According to Simply Flying, the final BelugaXL rolled off the production line in Toulouse, France, earlier this week. The plane is the sixth model to be finished, with each solely created to transport cargo around the world.

To set this final Beluga XL apart from the five others built, those fun-loving Europeans have given Beluga number 6 an updated look. It still features the signature Airbus tailfin, but Airbus has given the behemoth a big cheeky grin up front and a winking eye graphic on one side. Cute.

With its gleaming paintwork finished, the sixth Beluga freighter will take to the skies for its first flight in the coming days and, Simply Flying reports, will enter service for Airbus later this year. As with the other Belugas XL aircraft in the fleet, the final plane will be used across the plane maker’s production facilities, where it will transport large components between its sites in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the UK.

Built around the Airbus A330, the Beluga XL is one of the largest cargo planes in the world. It was first unveiled back in November 2014 and the first aircraft took to the skies in July 2018.

Each of the six planes comprises a fuselage that’s more than 200 feet long and 29 feet wide. The cabin is almost 25 feet wide and the large cargo door at the front of the Beluga XL means it is capable of carrying some pretty hefty cargo, such as plane wings and fuselage sections. In total, the plane’s cargo hold measures an impressive 7,247 cubic ft.

To transport all that stuff around the world, the Beluga XL is powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, which help give the plane a range of almost 2,500 miles."

And not just because he participated in the exercise as a reservist of the German Air Force. ""It was very special to see your own products in action,"" says Labonde. By ""your own products,"" he means the Eurofighter and Tornado fighter jets, the A400M military transport and A330 MRTT multi-role tanker transport aircraft, all of which are produced by Airbus and were in action at Air Defender alongside 250 aircraft. The objective of the exercise with 10.000 participants from 25 nations: To optimise and expand the cooperation of allies based on a simulated attack on NATO territory.

""Everyone wanted Air Defender to be a success""

At the Joint Force Air Component Headquarters (JFAC) in Kalkar, near the Dutch border, Labonde helped to plan and coordinate large Composite Air Operations: ""As a member of the planning team for Linked Air Warfare Operations, I helped design defensive, offensive and support missions within a defined area, taking into account the capabilities and limitations of the various attack and support components to enhance their combined effectiveness.” And that was no mean feat: ""The continuous presence of aircraft naturally brings a certain complexity: When does who need to be refueled and how? Which mission requires which aircraft? And: what are the other aircraft doing in the meantime?""

To make sure all this runs smoothly, Labonde and his colleagues at JFAC planned the flight movements 48 hours in advance and communicated them to the air crews 24 hours in advance. The be-all and end-all: digital communication in the data network, says Labonde: ""We linked the different IT systems of the participating nations, so that they were able to transmit the information promptly and in encrypted form."" That was quite a challenge, but it worked quite well, according to Labonde: ""Active soldiers and reservists, the international liaison officers of the operational squadrons - everyone worked hand in hand so that we could plan all the missions smoothly - and thus did our part to ensure that Air Defender ran safely and successfully.""

The aerospace industry has been waiting for this moment of recovery since the Covid-19 pandemic flattened demand for air travel early in 2020.

The sector always suspected business would bounce back, though the question of when remained guesswork, and for many months the recovery appeared to be limping along.

But first-half 2023 order figures released by the world’s two prime aircraft manufacturers reveal a change in the air.

Airbus and Boeing each landed far more orders in the first six months of this year than they did in the same period last year. Much of the order momentum came during last month’s Paris air show, and from two large India airlines.

And although Airbus bested Boeing in first-half order totals, the US giant held its own, securing notable new sales.

That good news comes as the companies are also progressing in getting more new jets through their factories. Both are showing signs they are beginning to overcome some of the constraints imposed by a long-battered supply chain.

But the real test lies in the months and years ahead, when Airbus and Boeing will demonstrate if they are able to meet the formidable production demands for which they have signed up.

AIRBUS BREAKS 1,000-UNIT MARK

Airbus closed the first half of 2023 having received new orders for 1,080 aircraft, though 36 cancellations brought its net new orders for the six-month period to 1,044, the company’s data shows. That is an impressive figure, being four times the 259 net new orders Airbus took in the same period last year – indicating that bullishness pervades airline board rooms.

Airbus’s first-half 2023 net orders included deals for a whopping 936 narrowbody jets, among them 33 A220s and 903 A320neo-family aircraft.

Notably, airlines and aircraft lessors are increasingly putting their deposits behind A321neos, a type that has proved particular popular for its economics on medium-haul and high-demand routes, including those across the Atlantic Ocean.

Of Airbus’s 903 net A320neo orders received during the six-month period, 541 were A321neos, a bump that suddenly made the A321neo Airbus’s best-ever selling jet. The company has now taken total orders for 5,163 of the stretched type, edging out 4,763 orders for the original A320.

Airbus’s first-half 2023 figures also signal that demand for long-haul air travel is returning. The company closed the period having taken orders for 101 A350s, including four freighters, 21 of the -900 variant and 76 of the larger -1000, its data show.

With those deals, Airbus’s total number of A350 orders broke the four-digit mark, hitting 1,026 – a milestone reflecting the company’s progress in competing its A350 against the 787. The Boeing jet still holds the sales lead – Boeing has logged more than 1,600 total orders for 787s – but the A350 is making strides.

A large share of Airbus’s orders this year came from two major deals with Indian carriers at the Paris air show. On 19 June, discounter IndiGo signed to purchase 500 A320neo-family jets – the largest order Airbus has received in recent memory. The deal includes orders for 125 A320neos and 375 A321neos, though Airbus says the split could change.

One day later, on 20 June, Airbus said Air India firmed its own order for 250 Airbus jets, including 140 A320neos, 70 A321neos, 34 A350-1000s and six A350-900s.

BOEING BOUNCES BACK

Boeing similarly reported a much stronger start to 2023. It landed new orders for 527 jets during the period, though its net orders came to 415 when accounting for 112 cancellations. By comparison, Boeing secured 186 net new orders in the same period last year.

The improvement reflects significant progress made by the US manufacturer in restoring positive momentum to both its 737 Max and 787 programmes.

The future of the Max programme had been unclear following a 20-month grounding that ended early during the Covid-19 pandemic, which further dampened interest. All along, while industry analysts urged Boeing to launch development of a 737 replacement, Boeing executives resisted, insisting instead that the Max was still the aircraft that would carry the company into next decade.

Boeing has of late put real momentum behind the Max, having signed deals with several major carriers in recent months, and landing 283 net Max orders in 2023 through June, up from 152 in the first six months of 2022.

Boeing also has Air India to thank for a chunk of its sales. In addition to signing for Airbus jets during the Paris show, the carrier ordered 220 Boeing aircraft, including 190 737 Max, 10 777X and 20 787s.

Boeing’s recent success selling 787s has extended well beyond the Air India deal.

In June, the manufacturer finalised an order for 39 of the widebody twin-jets from Saudi Arabian start-up Riyadh Air. Other airlines to order the type this year include Air Niugini, Eva Air, Lufthansa and lessor Air Lease, and Boeing has disclosed orders for some 40 787s from unidentified buyers.

The deals left Boeing with 109 net new 787 orders received during the first half of 2023 – marking a rebound of sorts following manufacturing quality troubles that led Boeing to halt 787 deliveries for about 22 months until August last year.

Both Airbus and Boeing ended the half-year mark sitting on significantly larger backlogs than one year earlier – Airbus with unfilled orders for 7,967 jets (up from 7,046 in June 2022) and Boeing with 4,879 aircraft in its backlog (up from 4,239).

Both companies are also having some success in ramping aircraft deliveries – which they have been trying to do, working against supply chain troubles, for most of the last two years.

Boeing’s first-half 2023 deliveries came to 266 aircraft, including 211 737 Max. By comparison, it delivered 216 jets, including 181 Max, in the first six months of last year.

Airbus has been doing better, passing the half-year with 316 deliveries, including 281 narrowbodies (A220s and A320neo-family types). In the same six months of 2022, Airbus delivered 295 aircraft, among them 255 narrowbodies.

Boeing has said it aims to hike 737 production from a current rate of roughly 31 monthly to 50 monthly by 2025 or 2026. To accommodate that uptick, it intends next year to open a fourth 737 production line, located not in the 737’s longtime Renton assembly base, but rather in Everett, where Boeing has long produced widebody jets.

Similarly, on 10 July Airbus said it had opened a new A320neo-family final assembly line at its Toulouse facility, part of a strategy to ramp production to 75 of those narrowbodies in 2026."
