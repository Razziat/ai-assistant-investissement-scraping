Airbus A220: The Best Short Haul Jet? - God Save The Points,"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLXNob3J0LWhhdWwtYmVzdC1wYXNzZW5nZXItZXhwZXJpZW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I’m super late to the game, but I can now say I’ve found a jet I’ll go out of my way for. The Airbus A220, which started life as the Bombardier C Series (it’s complicated) is a short haul jet that makes you feel like you’re in a bigger, better jet.

After years of the plane eluding my itineraries, I finally managed to fly one this week and it’s a rare case where I think passengers can feel the difference.

With operators in the North America including Air Canada, Delta and JetBlue, as well as across Europe with airlines like Swiss and Air France — and Asia with Korean Air, there are plenty of chances to give it a try. Here’s a few reasons why I think you should.

Massive Windows

Ok, windows aren’t going to change the date, time or route you fly, but I’ll start with this softball. They’re a nice perk and make the joys of flying more joyous.

I had an early morning flight switching timezones from darkness into light, and got to appreciate how these big windows make flying more beautiful. Sound hyperbolic? Have a look at this no filter (seriously) of the journey.

Wider Seats Better Comfort

Flying short haul these days can become an exercise in torture. Even the most renowned legacy airlines cut seat margins to levels which test how much humans really want to go somewhere.

From the days of 32” of legroom as standard, we now have 29” in many short haul planes. For seat width, 18.5” became 17” at a push! But not on the A220! On the Swiss A220-300 I was on, seats were 18.5” wide, with at least 30” of legroom.

My seat had 32” and it was far more comfortable in economy than the business class seat from a European competitor I flew in on, aboard their Airbus A320.

Because of the dimensions of the plane, there’s no incentive for airlines to make the seats narrower. A 3-2 layout on this plane doesn’t have the width to become 3-3, so there’s no reason to make the experience “worse”. I even found these slimline seats to be rather comfortable and genuinely ergonomic.

Better Air And Cabin Environment

The Airbus A220 is part of this newer series of jets which have better air, and slightly better pressurization. Helping this case, the ceilings are higher, which gives more of a luxury feel — or at least less panic attack — than most small jets.

I wouldn’t always say this, but I think you can truly feel the better pressurization of the plane and it feels less fatiguing than others, the same way an Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 does.

Bins Designed For Bags

I’ve often wondered “who designs these things” when looking at aircraft storage. Despite a world of roller bags, there was never any space to efficiently store them in the cabin until the last few years.

The A220 is a fantastic iteration of this, which allows you to place full sized carry ons in overhead bins on their side, allowing for infinitely more bags to be stored in a single bin.

For routes which feature checked baggage averse travelers, this allows everyone to put their bag in the overhead bin nearest their seat without any drama.

Our cabin was full of business travelers and I couldn’t see anyone having storage issues. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to say that. Flying back in business class on a European competitor which uses the old bins, I could barely find space for my roller bag.

Worth A Look

Sometimes, particularly for leisure trips, there’s a bit of wiggle room. Do I want to leave at 10 or 11? This airport, or that airport?! For me, I’ll actively seek to fly the Airbus A220 whenever it’s available.

If I’m using Google Flights to price out flight and see one airline has an A220 at the same price of another airline using an antiquated jet, I would legitimately consider that to be a sale driver. I’m a fan, and I think if you have a chance to fly this up and coming short haul beast, you will be too.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985633492469788}",neutral,0.9985633492469788,0
Airbus A380: Where the superjumbo is flying as aviation returns - CNN,"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYTM4MC13aGVyZS10by1mbHktYXZpYXRpb24tcmV0dXJuLWNtZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYTM4MC13aGVyZS10by1mbHktYXZpYXRpb24tcmV0dXJuLWNtZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

When Airbus announced plans to cease production of its A380 aircraft back in 2019, heartbroken aviation fans found solace in the fact that the superjumbo wasn’t set to stop flying anytime soon.

Production on this much-loved aircraft was due to continue for another couple years, and plenty of airlines had active A380s in their fleet.

But fast forward a year, and the A380’s hefty size and steep operational costs had no place in the pandemic’s minimal, cost-efficient international flight schedules.

Thanks to Covid-19, most of the world’s A380 fleet were grounded.

Lufthansa’s decision to park its A380 turned into the German carrier permanently retiring the superjumbos. The last A380 emblazoned with Air France livery took its final flight. It was increasingly unclear whether the A380 would survive the shutdown.

But while the A380s days are undoubtedly numbered, some airlines have announced plans to get the aircraft back in the air. Singapore Airlines will be reinstating the A380 on November 2021 flights to London, the same month British Airways will be flying superjumbos from the UK to Europe.

If you’re still hoping to experience the A380’s memorably spacious interior and quiet inflight experience before the plane’s a thing of the past, here’s our round-up of airline A380 routes to check out.

Singapore Airlines

The A380’s first ever commercial voyage back in 2007 was via Singapore Airlines, traveling from Singapore to Sydney.

Pre-pandemic, Singapore Airlines had 17 A380s. They were all grounded when Covid-19 hit, and in November 2020 the airline announced plans to cut its superjumbo fleet down to 12.

Now Singapore Airlines has revealed plans to return some of its A380s to the skies.

Singapore Airlines told CNN Travel that from November 18, A380s will be flying one of the airline’s three nonstop Singapore to London services, as Singapore introduces quarantine-free travel for certain vaccinated travelers.

Siva Govindasamy, Singapore Airlines’ global public affairs head said that Singapore Airlines’ recognizes the A380s enduring appeal for passengers, and that’s partly why the airline’s returning the aircraft to rotation.

“The A380 is a wonderful aircraft,” he said. “Some people just book the A380 specifically to fly on it.”

Govindasamy added that it makes economic sense to return the A380 to the London to Singapore path, as the aircraft’s seat density lends itself well to routes where airport slots are limited.

The decision is also part of Singapore Airlines’ “premium positioning,” as Govindasamy puts it.

“From a brand perspective, the A380 really ticks a lot of boxes for us operating it,” he said.

As for reinstating the A380 for destinations beyond London, Govindasamy said Singapore Airlines is currently considering other routes that could be well served by the superjumbo.

“We’ll continue to monitor this very closely over the next couple of weeks and months before making that decision,” he said, adding that returning the A380 to its original Singapore to Sydney route is something the airline “will not say no to.”

On October 18, Singapore Airlines’ also confirmed to CNN Travel plans to deploy the A380 on select flights from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from November 2021. It is believed that this 60 minute flight will be the shortest A380 passenger flight currently in operation.

Nine of Singapore Airlines’ A380s have undergone a refit and three are in the makeover process. Travelers splashing out on first class on the reinstated London to Singapore route will be able to enjoy the airline’s swanky suites.

British Airways

After months of transatlantic travel restrictions, the US/UK travel corridor is set to reopen in November and BA is upping its flight schedule accordingly.

The British flag carrier has confirmed the superjumbo will be part of this opening line up, with plans to initially bring back four of its 12 grounded A380s.

Travelers will be able to enjoy the aircraft’s comfortable interior en route to Los Angeles and Miami this winter, as well as cruising from London to Dubai come December.

But before the superjumbos ferry British travelers on long-awaited jaunts to the US, they’ll first hop across the English Channel on some short-haul flights “to allow for crew familiarization,” according to a BA statement.

It’s not every day you travel from London to Europe on a double-decker plane, so avgeeks will be desperately trying to secure seats on these one-off flights.

Trying to book on these routes is guesswork for now, as BA has yet to confirm which short-haul flights will be operating the A380.

Emirates

The largest operator of the A380 is Emirates. When Emirates’ latest superjumbo joins its fleet later this year, the Dubai-based airline will be home to 118 A380s.

The airline announced in September 2021 plans to deploy the A380 to 27 cities by the end of November 2021. Travelers will be able to travel on board Emirates’ A380 to destinations including Amsterdam, Sao Paulo and Zurich.

On board Emirates’ A380s are swanky lounges and private suites, and premium travelers can even shower on board thanks to the A380 Shower Spa.

The route to keep tabs on is Dubai to Auckland – the Airbus A380’s size and comfort makes it ideal for long-haul journeys, and pre-pandemic, Dubai to Auckland was the longest Airbus A380 non-stop route. Emirates’ aircraft cover 14,193 kilometers over the course of this 10-hour journey.

For now, superjumbo fans could check out Emirates’ newest A380 flight path from Dubai to Istanbul, launched on October 1. Emirates is the first airline to fly superjumbos to and from Istanbul.

Choice route: Dubai to Istanbul – a first for the A380 and an opportunity to get back on a superjumbo this year.

Qatar Airways

Back in Spring 2021, Qatar Airways’ CEO Akbar Al Baker told Simple Flying purchasing 10 A380s was the airline’s “biggest mistake.”

This statement left many worried for the superjumbo’s future at Qatar Airways, but as international travel increases, the landscape seems to be changing.

According to the airline’s online schedule, Qatar Airways has plans to operate A380s between Doha and London Heathrow, and Doha and Paris Charles de Gaulle, from December 2021.

A Qatar Airways spokesperson declined to comment on the A380’s return to service and the airline’s future plans for the aircraft.

Choice route: Doha to Paris – A380s were assembled in France, so returning on a superjumbo to where it all began seems appropriate

Qantas

Qantas has 12 A380s in its fleet, and they originally weren’t estimated to return to service until 2023. However in August 2021, the Aussie airline confirmed that five of its A380s would recommence flying sooner than expected.

Superjumbos are set to operate Qantas’ Sydney-Los Angeles route from July 2022, and from November 2022 they should be crisscrossing between Sydney and London via Singapore.

“The A380s work well on these long-haul routes when there’s sufficient demand, and the high vaccination rates in both markets would underpin this,” read a Qantas statement.

While two of Qantas’ A380s are set to be retired, the remaining 10 should all be back in service with newly fitted interiors by early 2024, according to the airline’s statement, which said timing would be “dependent on how quickly the market recovers.”

Announcing the 2022 A380 return, Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said the decision was made because the UK and US were “key markets for Qantas” before the pandemic, and seem to be recovering well.

“We expect travel demand on these routes to be strong enough for the A380,” he added.

“The A380 is a great aircraft that our passengers love. The 10 aircraft we’re bringing back will have all-new interiors and we expect them to be part of our fleet for many years to come,” said Joyce.

Korean Air

Pre-pandemic, Korean Air’s 10 A380s were “mainly used on long-haul routes with high traffic volume,” a Korean Air spokesperson told CNN Travel.

While Korean Air’s A380s aren’t currently flying to New York’s JFK Airport or Paris’ Charles de Gaulle, two of the aircraft’s former haunts, the Korean Air spoksperson confirmed that the airline is currently operating the A380 from Incheon to China’s Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport once a week.

Guangzhou is also a hub for China Southern Airlines, which has five A380s. The Chinese airline is currently flying superjumbos between Melbourne and Guangzhou weekly, as well as on some flights to and from Los Angeles, according to FlightAware.com.

Korean Air is in the middle of merging with Asiana Airlines, an airline with six A380s of its own.

The Korean Air spokesperson pointed CNN Travel to a recent interview with FlightGlobal in which Korean Air’s Chairman Walter Cho said “the A380s will be leaving Korean Air’s fleet within five years.”

Korean Air’s A380s days might be numbered, but they’re still around for now.

All Nippon Airways

Japanese airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) premiered its first A380 in 2019. Another superjumbo followed a couple months later, and from October 16, ANA will have three A380s in its fleet when a third “Flying Honu” joins its line-up.

All Nippon Airways’ A380s are perhaps the world’s most distinctive superjumbos, each painted in vibrant hues to resemble Hawaiian sea turtles, a nod to their flight route from Tokyo Narita, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii. “Honu” is a term used for sea turtles in Hawaii.

An All Nippon Airways spokesperson told CNN Travel that while its A380s aren’t currently flying to Hawaii on a regular basis – there’s a Boeing 747 doing that route right now – the airline is “looking for opportunities to fly the A380 on the Narita - Honolulu route on limited peak season days.” In August, an All Nippon Airways’ A380 flew from Narita to Honolulu on two roundtrips.

ANA’s A380s have also been flying domestic charter flights – so-called “flights to nowhere” – and they’ve been used as pop-up restaurants.

The next ANA A380 charter flight will take place on October 30, flying from Narita to Shimojishima, while Tokyo locals can book into the A380 pop-up restaurants in October and November.

ANA told CNN Travel it’s “closely monitoring demand as well as immigration guidelines and public health measures implemented by the respective government” in order to work out when the A380 can return on a more regular basis.

Analyzing The Airbus A380's Premature End - Aviation Week,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYW5hbHl6aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwcy1wcmVtYXR1cmUtZW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A few minutes before midnight on June 17, 2020, a mild summer Wednesday night in the small town of Levignac in southern France, the local bar normally would have been about to close. But that night the place was full despite the raging pandemic, and outside the street was filling with hundreds of people—both locals and many who had come from Toulouse, a 30 min. drive away.

Only 14 years after first delivery, A380 production stops

Lack of engine and airframe efficiency were competitive disadvantages

Emirates is set to receive the last three aircraft in November

They were there to witness a historic moment: A convoy of trucks was transporting large Airbus A380 fuselage sections on the country roads of Toulouse’s hinterland to the Blagnac final assembly line for the very last time. Those sections, accompanied that night by farewell wishes of many who once worked on the program, have since turned into the last A380 ever produced, an aircraft that is slated to be handed over to Emirates Airline in November.

The delivery will close one of the most spectacular chapters in European aerospace history. It was spectacular in many ways: The A380 was the largest commercial aircraft ever produced, intended to eclipse Boeing’s 747; passengers and pilots loved its comfort and ease of flying, even if airline finance departments were less enamored with it. The aircraft’s production run, spanning just 14 years, was drama-filled, including the expensive redesign of its wings and increasingly desperate campaigns to sell more of the giant aircraft and extend its life. They were full of negotiations about even larger versions and Neos, after the reengining concept had worked so well for the A320 family.

But after Emirates finally pulled the plug on a large follow-up order that would have saved the program in the winter of 2018, it was up to departing Airbus CEO Tom Enders to finally decide the ending for the A380. It had become clear that Airbus would never recover the €25 billon ($30 billion) or so in research and development costs sunk into the program over the years. And with no new orders keeping production open even at minimal rates, it became unsustainable. Europe’s most ambitious commercial aircraft program post-Concorde had become a gigantic failure and a prime example of management reading the market improperly.

Was it a misreading, though? Was there ever a chance of it continuing until demand recovery?

In the weeks before that final delivery, Aviation Week spoke with many insiders who shared their views and memories. Among them were Enders and former Airbus sales chief John Leahy as well as Nico Buchholz, himself a former Airbus sales executive who later ordered the aircraft for Lufthansa as its head of fleet strategy. Some still think the program could have been rescued. But the look back into its history also shows that industry doubts about the A380’s viability had begun even before first delivery.

Paradigm Shift

Enders was head of strategy at Airbus’ German shareholder DASA in the 1990s—the manufacturer was still a loose economic interest group (French acronym GIE), a consortium of shareholders that was nowhere near being integrated. Much later, of course, the A380 was the key factor in fundamentally changing that. In the 1990s, discussions about the risks and opportunities of building an A3XX were intensifying after years of studies. “Airbus did not stumble into [building] the A380; we were very aware of the project’s risks,” Enders says. “But then, technology and the market changed faster than everyone had thought.”

In hindsight, the writing may have been on the wall for the A380 even before its own entry into service—even as early as four years before. In December 2003, Boeing decided to launch the 787, a revolutionary aircraft in many ways, particularly in its use of lightweight composites for structural weight savings. By contrast, “Airbus’ achievement in the A380 was mainly to be able to build something that big,” says Buchholz. Other than that, the A380 was structurally fairly conventional.

Of equal importance was engine manufacturers’ commitment to build powerplants for the Boeing 787 that were significantly better than those of the A380.

The consequences were fundamental: Suddenly, the paradigm of building larger aircraft to cut unit costs was broken. The unit costs of 787—and later the A350—were comparable to or even better than those of the much larger A380, but with a considerably lower risk of not being able to fill the aircraft. Unit revenues were the other side of the coin: There was greater pressure on yields, with literally hundreds of additional seats to fill on every flight. Once Lufthansa started flying the A380 across the Atlantic, the airline found that the yield on its Frankfurt-New York route fell by almost as much as unit costs.

Looking back, Leahy has harsh words for Rolls-Royce and GE Aviation. “Airbus was blindsided by the engine manufacturers in 2000, when we were getting ready to launch it,” he says. “Our program people had assurances [from] the engine OEMs that there was nothing on the horizon with better specific fuel consumption [SFC] for years to come. And three years later, when we had not even delivered the first aircraft, GE and Rolls had engines with 15% better SFCs that they were bringing out for the 787. That left Airbus at a commercial disadvantage that was very unfortunate.”

The aircraft’s most important customer, Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, agrees to an extent. “I regret that it was not reengined, that the weight was not taken out,” he says. However, he also points to the many problems the A350 and the 787 have had since the market introductions of the next generation of engines, issues the A380 has not faced to the same degree. He asks whether the A380 may have had the same reliability issues, which are hard enough to handle on a 150-seat narrowbody but could require large sums for passenger compensation and handling for just one canceled A380 flight. The tradeoff between efficiency and reliability was a big consideration.

When Airbus decided to launch the A380, it was still chasing another idea, and therefore the wrong target. “In the 1990s, not only Airbus but also many airlines were still very focused on four engines when it came to widebodies,” Enders recalls. And Airbus thought it had to build an aircraft that would compete with the 747 and break into the Boeing monopoly on very large jets. In 2015, in the midst of increasingly desperate struggles to find new customers, then-CEO Fabrice Bregier conceded that the A380 had been launched “at least 10 years too soon.”

Perhaps it was not launched too soon but too late: In 1990, Boeing received orders for 122 747-400s and delivered 70. Ten years later, when Airbus committed to building the A380, 747 orders were down to 26 and deliveries to 25. And with few exceptions since, 747 production has continuously declined.

Airbus’ growing problem was not just the 787, or later its own A350, which further deepened the market shift. In April 2004, it was none other than Air France, in Airbus’ backyard, that took delivery of the first two Boeing 777-300ERs. That aircraft, and not the A380, replaced the 747 as the reference on long-haul trunk routes before slowly being superseded by even more efficient twins.

“We all have misjudged the future of the twins, and that led to the efficiency problem of the A380,” Enders says. “I only admit this reluctantly, but Boeing has largely been right with its point-to-point argument.” He is referencing the idea that passengers, when having the choice, prefer nonstop flights over hub connections. Both Leahy and Clark disagree with the idea that the hub concept has weakened. “I don’t share the view that the days of the superhub are over at all,” Clark says.

Missed Opportunities

The two-year phase from 2005 to 2007 was crucial to the A380’s early demise, not only because of the growing threat from more efficient twins. In those years, billions of euros in extra costs were added to the program, and important decisions that could have been made were not.

The aircraft had performed its first flight at the end of April 2005, a milestone for the entire aviation industry. Airbus garnered applause from around the world for the achievement. But a little over a month later, the company was forced to announce the first (six-month) delay in the program. As it turned out, different parts of the consortium had used different versions of the CATIA design software and, infamously, as a result many of the cables inside the fuselage were too short.

An almost incomprehensible struggle followed. Airbus threw literally thousands of technicians and engineers at the problem. Many in charge burned out—and many left, but those who stayed learned tough lessons that were incredibly valuable for their later careers. Airbus had to announce two more delays before finally regaining control of the situation toward the end of 2006.

The crisis was so deep that management considered the most radical moves. “We asked ourselves whether we should terminate the program,” Enders reveals. “But that would not have been right back then. Development was very far advanced, and the reputational damage would have been huge.”

There were still consequences. EADS had been formed in 2000 along with the launch of the A380. The former Airbus GIE was converted into a real company a year later. But in 2006, EADS acquired the remaining 20% in Airbus SAS previously held by BAE Systems and proceeded with much deeper integration. “We pushed through relatively brutal integration in 2006-07,” Enders says. “Before that there had been a lot of talk about it but no real action.”

Airlines had their own perspective, which changed substantially between the 2000 launch and entry into service seven years later. “In 2000, you could not predict what crystallized in 2005—that the aircraft was technically outdated,” says Buchholz, who ordered the A380s for Lufthansa. After all, the aircraft’s unit costs were advertised to be 13% better than those of the 747-400. But then things started to move.

Japan opened up Tokyo Haneda Airport for international flights, weakening the argument that the A380 was needed for slot-constrained Narita International Airport. China built new international airports at a record pace and encouraged long-haul service to them. “You could get a feeling that the A380 was going to be too large,” remembers Buchholz. “But you could not really prove it.”

Buchholz contends that it might have been possible to rescue the A380, but it would have required early, decisive and painful action. When the program was delayed bya cabin installation disaster, Airbus should have used the opportunity to modernize the aircraft with a better engine based on ongoing development programs for the 787 and later the A350. “With a better engine, the A380 would have had a longer life,” he says.

“With new engines, it would have been an unbeatable aircraft in the marketplace,” Leahy asserts. “We came close to pulling it off. Had we had the right engines, we would probably have rewritten history.”

But he does not think Buchholz’s idea of pushing for an early reengining then would have been possible. “There were commitments made; the engines were being developed. It would have pushed back the thing a couple of years, [and] there would have been big fights with the engine manufacturers. They had invested a lot of money into that generation of engines.”

On Oct. 15, 2007, Airbus finally delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines. A little over a week later, the aircraft flew its first commercial service from Singapore to Sydney. It was a major milestone that, Airbus hoped, would pave the way for a less eventful future and a ramp-up of production to 45 aircraft a year, a rate of just under four aircraft per month. Of course, Airbus never reached rate 45. Production peaked at 30 aircraft in both 2012 and 2014. The last relatively big year for the type was 2016, when Airbus again managed to deliver 28. However, the turning point that likely sealed the aircraft’s fate also occurred in 2016 and led to the end of production five years later.

Weighty Issues

The nine years between 2007 and 2016 continued to be drama-filled. Emirates, by far the type’s most important and loyal operator, had just taken delivery of its first aircraft in early 2008 when the U.S. subprime and global financial crisis unfolded and heavily affected demand for international air travel. Airbus delivered 12 A380s in 2008 and only 10 a year later, a step in the wrong direction. It was not able to expand production in a significant manner until 2010, when it decided to shelve plans for the A380-900 in light of the huge financial burdens accumulated and development work on the A350, A320neo and A400M.

The stretched A380 version was what the Airbus designers really had in mind when they built a wing much larger than necessary for the baseline A380-800. It made that version heavier and so significantly less efficient than would have been possible with a smaller wing optimized for its fuselage size. “The [A380-800] was not the aircraft that we actually wanted to build,” Enders says.

“The design was optimized for larger variants,” Buchholz says. Airlines knew that, of course. But some, like Lufthansa, decided right from the beginning that the -900 would have been too large. The problem with the -800—“you can’t send the upper deck somewhere else when a route does not perform as planned,” as Bucholz puts it—would only have become worse with a larger aircraft, he says. The lack of flexibility was frightening airline planners.

On the other hand, Emirates was foremost of a number of airlines that were very much in favor of the -900. They pointed out that the larger version would be much more efficient and could reinstate the unit-cost advantage over smaller long-haul aircraft, including the A350 and 787. They also saw a market for it on their busiest routes. “We wanted the -900, not the -800,” Clark says. “The aircraft would have had another 120 seats. But when the idea was discussed, there was a slowing down in appetite [at other airlines]. We did not share [their] view.”

The real problem with the A380-900 plan was not that the stretch was never built, it was that it made the -800 a much worse version. “The fact that from the very beginning they built weight into the airplane so they could do the -900 was a program mistake,” Leahy points out. “You just don’t build extra weight into the airplane so you can stretch it. You optimize the aircraft, and then you figure out how to stretch it by taking some of the margin that you did not need. When you build in the capacity for another 100 seats from Day 1, you are going to build a heavy airplane.”

Clark says it still worked well for Emirates. “In the years after the financial crisis, 80% of our profits came from the A380,” he notes. “The A380 is still a hugely efficient aircraft, even though it has old-technology engines.” According to his calculations, a two-class A380 has 4% lower fuel burn per seat than a 787-9 at equivalent space allocation, which would mean putting 670 seats onto the aircraft. Emirates’ two-class A380s currently have 617 seats.

The airline went above and beyond anyone else in the industry to make the aircraft the core of its brand. “It was a wonderful, exciting challenge to deal with this enormous amount of space,” Clark remembers somewhat wistfully. “We put in the bars and the showers. We created a Ritz Carlton.”

But that Ritz Carlton was hugely complex to build. “The showers caused a lot of issues,” Clark says. Pumping hot water up to the upper deck with sufficient pressure was just one of them.

‘A Brick Wall’

One of the biggest misunderstandings in the history of the A380 was its true market potential in China. “If small Dubai can take more than 100 aircraft, we should be able to place a lot more of them into China,” a senior Airbus executive recalls thinking. But in the entire production run of the aircraft, only five were actually delivered to a Chinese airline, China Southern, the first of which arrived in October 2011. So why did China not work out?

When Airbus tried to sell the A380 to the nation’s big three—Air China, China Eastern and China Southern—some factors worked against them. Given their relatively poor reputation for customer service and product quality, the carriers lacked confidence that they could compete with their U.S. and European rivals on long-haul routes, let alone with an aircraft that big.

Long-haul flying was also a much smaller part of their business at the time, as opposed to the late 2010s. Being very conservative, the Chinese airlines also disliked launching a new aircraft, or even taking delivery of one, until performance was proven well after market introduction. The odds for Chinese business were always much lower than some in Toulouse had imagined.

“The obvious target [for A380s] should have been Air China,” says one insider. Of the three airlines, it was the one with a base in the country’s capital, and in many ways it was perceived as the flag carrier. But, unfortunately, the airline always had been close to Boeing and ended up being one of the few carriers around the world that ordered the 747-8.

For Leahy, the case is clear. “There was an enormous amount of politics involved in this from the U.S. and Boeing,” he says. “There was a lot of pressure on Beijing to not go with the airplane and stay with the 747. There was a lot of ingrained inertia with the old team in Beijing. That’s where we hit a brick wall.”

Some China experts believe it was still possible at some stage to have placed the A380 with Air China. “If Cathay Pacific had gone for the A380, Air China would have followed,” says a source with knowledge of past talks.“ Cathay certainly would have helped,” Leahy agrees.

Although the carrier’s former CEO Tony Tyler has always been skeptical about the aircraft, Cathay was nonetheless close to an order at various points, particularly in 2010. One time, according to an insider, a deal failed only because Toulouse was not willing to accept some last-minute concessions demanded by the airline.The Hong Kong-based carrier was perceived as a role model for strategy, fleet and product quality by Air China, which has since also become a big shareholder. But Cathay did not jump.

The only order for the A380 ever placed by a Chinese carrier also played a role, notes one executive. “You could argue that selling to China Southern was a mistake,” he says. “It really enraged Air China, because they viewed themselves as the flag carrier. There was also a lot of personal rivalry between the CEOs, and when China Southern went for [the A380], Air China had to show it was the wrong move.”

A fleet of just five aircraft was also suboptimal and a compromise that did not work, particularly from China Southern’s main base in Guangzhou. The airline always planned to base the aircraft at Beijing but was not allowed to deploy them on routes from Air China’s hub. The two carriers tried to negotiate a joint A380 operation but in the end could not come to an agreement.

At one point, Hong Kong Airlines placed an order for 10 A380s, but insiders say the commitment was “never very credible.”

Had Airbus succeeded in breaking into the Chinese market, would it really have been literally with hundreds of aircraft, as some hoped? One executive with deep knowledge of the situation says Air China could have taken no more than 15 A380s and China Eastern and China Southern possibly 10 each. Even if the Hong Kong Airlines deal had gone through, only about 50 aircraft across all Chinese and Hong Kong-based airlines seemed feasible, the executive says. “Two-hundred was never going to be realistic,” he asserts.

In the meantime, the A380 went through its first safety and second industrial crisis. On Nov. 4, 2010, Qantas Flight 32 (QF32), an A380 registered VH-OQA, took off from Singapore Changi Airport bound for Sydney, just like the type’s first commercial flight three years earlier. But this time, the flight did not go smoothly. VH-OQA suffered an uncontained failure of engine No. 2, a Rolls-Royce Trent 900, 4 min. after takeoff, causing extensive damage to the airframe, wings, tanks and one hydraulic system. Two other engines continued to operate, but only in degraded mode.

QF32 landed back in Singapore and no one was hurt, but both Qantas and Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded their A380 fleets. According to a 2011 preliminary report by the Australian Transport Safety Board, 55 Trent 900 engines had to be replaced across the world fleet.

As dramatic as the incident was, the type’s most serious since commercial service had begun also demonstrated the resilency of the aircraft—and the flight’s crew. Redundancy had paid off.

VH-OQA was repaired in Singapore and returned to Australia in April 2012. During the repairs, tiny cracks in the wings were discovered. They turned out to be the start of the next industrial crisis: Airbus had to strengthen certain areas of the wings for in-service aircraft and use a new aluminum alloy for some parts going forward. The problem was eventually fixed, and it is not among the main causes of the premature end of production. But it made the program’s economics even worse. It was becoming increasingly clear that Airbus would never make a profit on the A380.

The Last Stand

But the airframer was still a long way from giving up. About a year after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had made mandatory checks for wing cracks, Airbus delivered the 100th A380 to Malaysia Airlines. With the industry now fully out of the global financial crisis, the air transport sector entered an unprecedented period of strong growth, helped by expanding global trade, low interest rates and—for the most part--—relatively low fuel prices. Those in charge in Toulouse were still hopeful the A380 could benefit and somehow turn the corner.

In November 2013, Emirates gave the program another boost:With 39 of the aircraft in service and another 51 on firm order, the airline bought 50 more at the Dubai Airshow. The three big Gulf carriers were peaking—they also placed massive commitments for the new Boeing 777X at the time. The Emirates deal was for the existing aircraft, but the A380neo concept was also discussed. After all, Airbus had launched the A320neo in 2010 and had received much better market feedback than expected.

A year after that Dubai Airshow, Airbus’ then-CEO Fabrice Bregier said the company would “one day” launch an A380neo and a stretch—and the bigger aircraft would get new engines. Six months later, he talked about an A380neo that would enter service around 2020. But in June 2016, Clark announced that the talks about an A380neo had “lapsed.”

“It was becoming apparent that we weren’t getting a customer on board for a Neo or a stretch,” Leahy says. “They were looking at some strong commitments from the engine manufacturers, as well as Airbus, about what the capability was going to be of a reengined airplane.”

Potential customers did not get what they wanted. Only one month later, in July 2016, Airbus made a U-turn by announcing a massive production cut from 28 aircraft that year to just 12 in 2018. The company was trying to buy time, as well as looking for alternatives.

In June 2017, Airbus presented the A380plus concept—the same airframe as before but with a more efficient cabin, around 80 more seats. Space was going to be made available, among other ways, by eliminating the rear staircase that was taking up a lot of room. But, again, customer response was lukewarm. Notably, Emirates did not like the idea since the A380’s luxury—the first-class shower and the bar at the back of the upper deck—had become part of its iconic brand.

Emirates stuck with the aircraft nonetheless. With the A380 deep in crisis mode and questions about its viability (and residual value) swirling, the airline agreed to buy another 36 aircraft at the beginning of 2018. The decision was preceded by months of tense negotiations with both Airbus and Rolls-Royce. The Engine Alliance of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney had long lost interest in further A380 business.

The deal, Airbus hoped, would enable it to sustain production at low but justifiable levels long enough for demand from other airlines to kick in eventually. It was also Leahy’s last marquee deal, a final exclamation point at the end of a very successful decades-spanning career as an aircraft salesman. Almost exactly one year after Leahy returned from the contract talks in Dubai, though, Enders pulled the plug on the project, announcing that production would cease in 2022, a date that would later be pulled forward to November 2021.

When Enders decided to end the program, Leahy had already retired, and the CEO had also announced his own departure. “Tom was leaving the company. He felt the A380 was not selling well, and he wanted to clear the deck for the new team and shut down the program,” the former sales chief says. “That is just the way Tom is.”

Leahy saw things differently. “I fully expected the A380 program to continue with Emirates’ support after I retired,” he says. “I left around February, handed over to a new commercial director and expected to have that deal finalized.”

So why didn’t that happen? “I never really managed to get to the bottom of why they were not able to do it,” he says. “I think it was a combination of Airbus and Rolls-Royce factors. Emirates still wanted to do the deal. I still believe it to this day.”

The case may be more nuanced. Clark remembers that Emirates was going through another round of fleet strategy planning in late 2018 and was coming to the conclusion that a fleet of 120 A380s was going to be “optimal.” At least a large part of that fleet is to be flown “well into the 2030s,” Clark notes.

However, in the end, even Emirates found that it did not want more of the aircraft and instead decided that a supplemental fleet of smaller A350s and 787-9s made more sense.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8015110492706299}",neutral,0.8015110492706299,0
Airbus C-295M new-generation twin-turboprop transport aircraft - Airforce Technology,"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2MyOTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The C295 transport aircraft is manufactured by Airbus. The Egyptian Air Force has a fleet of 24 C295 aircraft. The Canadian C295 aircraft being deployed in search and rescue (SAR) operations are designated as CC-295.

The C-295M is a twin-turboprop transport aircraft manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space. It was previously manufactured by Construccionnes Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), a founder member of the EADS company based in Madrid.

The new C-295M is a stretched derivative of the CN-235 transporter, with a characteristic high-wing, rear-loader design. The aircraft is noted for its short take-off and landing capability on semi-prepared runways and for the large payload capacity of 9,250kg. The landing and take-off run of just 320m and 670m allow the aircraft access to runways close to operational or crisis areas or where supplies and troops are needed.

The aircraft has a flight endurance of up to 11 hours and load capacity of 71 troops, 50 paratroopers and five pallets.

The C-295 aircraft can be configured to support multiple missions including VIP Transport, medical evacuation, military operations, air-to-air refuelling as well as civic and humanitarian missions.

Airbus developed a removable air-to-air refuelling (AAR) kit, which refuelled a C295 from the Spanish Air Force during flight tests. The system also underwent proximity tests with the C295 and the Spanish Air Force F-18 in January 2020. Further, the first wet contacts of the aircraft were achieved during an AAR tanker flight test campaign in the same month of 2020.

The removable refuelling system of the aircraft weighs 1,500kg. It is equipped with up to three additional fuel tanks, an operator’s console, and a hose drum unit with 100ft-long deployable hose. Spain deployed two C295 tactical transport aircraft to deliver medical supplies to the Canary Islands to support the fight against the COVID-19 coronavirus, in March 2020.

C-295M transport aircraft programme

CASA announced the aircraft in June 1997 at the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget and the first production C-295 made its first flight in 1998. The aircraft was granted INTA certification for military operations, and DGAG and FAA (FAR part 25) certification in 1999.

In 1999, the Spanish Ministry of Defence placed a contract for nine C-295M transport aircraft. The aircraft entered service with the Spanish Air Force in November 2001 and delivery of the aircraft was completed in 2006. A further two aircraft were ordered in 2005, two in 2006 and two in 2007 to bring the fleet to 15.

Airbus pushes new H175M for UK Puma replacement - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXB1c2hlcy1uZXctaDE3NW0tZm9yLXVrLXB1bWEtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters UK has held U.K. demonstrations with its new H175M medium-lift helicopter, a derivative of the commercial H175 and a type that the company sees as an ideal candidate for the U.K.’s emerging New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement. This project is aimed at replacing the Royal Air Force’s fleet of Airbus Puma HC2s by 2025, with as many as three other types also set to be replaced under a fleet recapitalization and rationalization plan within the U.K. Ministry of Defence’s (MoD’s) rotary-wing fleets.

Airbus is eager to go head-to-head with the Leonardo Helicopters AW149 and any other contenders that may emerge for the NMH project, however it is unclear if the U.K. will opt for a competition or a straight purchase. Speaking to Vertical, Arnaud Roux, Airbus Helicopters’ operational marketing manager for the H175M said: “We are waiting to hear more about the formal NMH requirement and Airbus is very keen to compete. It’s important that the U.K. gets the best value for money — it would be a pity if the MoD decided not to go for a competition.”

The U.K. Integrated Review’s Defence Command Paper, issued by the MoD on March 22, 2021, laid out plans for a new medium lift helicopter in the mid-2020s that will enable a consolidation of the disparate fleet of medium-lift helicopters from four platform types to one — with the central element being the replacement of the Puma. In recent times, the U.K. has opted for a sole-source acquisition based on a specific set of requirements and capabilities. However, in response to a parliamentary question in mid-October, the government said its expectation “is that the procurement will be subject to a competition,” but that “nor final decision has been taken.” As of yet, no formal specifications have been issued by the UK MoD.

The H175M is a new military derivative of Airbus’s H175 commercial helicopter, which has been in service since 2015 and is currently operating in a number of roles including search-and-rescue and law enforcement. Airbus says 26 H175s are already in daily North Sea operations off the coast of the U.K.

Airbus says the eight-tonne-class H175M could readily be offered with a typical array of military equipment. “We are going to add some equipment dedicated for the military version,” commented Roux. “We have already developed a lot of equipment for the Hong Kong Government Flying Service [GFS] H175s such as fast-roping, rapelling, ballistic protection, and an electro-optical turret.”

He said that new capabilities being evaluated for the UK requirement include troop seats, an electronic warfare system, and tactical radios. “We plan 14 troop seats for fully-equipped soldiers,” Roux added. “However, we could install 18 seats as per the civilian version of the H175. We want the H175M to be versatile. In fact, we already have 30 configurations certified for the H175 in public service use.”

Airbus acknowledges that the commercial H175 includes significant Chinese manufacturing input, but it is currently building an H175 airframe fully in Europe. The company says this is being produced entirely free of any elements sourced from China as the result of a project that has been under way for the past five years capitalising on European aerostructures capability. Airbus Helicopters says this specific example could be the first H175M to be delivered to the U.K. MoD if selected.

In keeping with the British Government’s prosperity agenda, Airbus Helicopters UK says it would establish a final assembly line for the H175M at the company’s wing production factory at Broughton in Wales, if it was selected for the NMH requirement, and that it aspires to export this helicopter version globally from the U.K. NMH is part of the UK Rotary Wing Strategy, with Leonardo Helicopters (UK) proposing to manufacture AW149s at its Yeovil factory if it was selected.

During Vertical’s media flight in the H175M demonstrator aircraft it was notable how few control inputs were required by the pilot. The platform features an impressive level of automation and the H175 has been designed to dramatically reduce pilot workload. Indeed, Airbus’s common avionics makes transitioning between types very straightforward. This could prove valuable for the H175M as an NMH candidate, with the UK Military Flying Training System (MFTS) already employing the Airbus H135 Juno and H145 Jupiter at RAF Shawbury for pilot and rear crew training.

New pilots would already be rated on the H175M’s common platform avionics, which would save a lot of money and time during progression to the front line. “I am type-rated on the H175, so I can also fly the H145. The two primary cockpit screens are the same,” Roux commented. “For my type rating I only required two hours of flying in the actual aircraft, the rest was in the simulator. All the avionics training is the same, so conversion to the H175M will just be mission training. It’s a big benefit.”

Roux says moving between platforms is so much easier thanks to the common avionics architecture of the Airbus platforms and that software upgrades flow through the various types quickly as they are released as a new capability for a type.

As the prospective contenders line-up for NMH, clearly the next major step will be the release of formal requirements from the MoD. Airbus Helicopters is keen to ensure the H175M gets a fair crack at the prize via a full and open competition, and its recent UK demonstrations could help pave the way to a fly-off to secure one of the most important military helicopter opportunities in the U.K. in many years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999933242797852}",neutral,0.9999933242797852,0
Airbus Zephyr Solar High Altitude Platform System (HAPS) reaches new heights in its successful 2021 summer test flights - Airbus,"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMC1haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLXNvbGFyLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtcGxhdGZvcm0tc3lzdGVtLWhhcHMtcmVhY2hlcy1uZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· Achieved 36 days of stratospheric flight, across two 2021 flights, proving Zephyr’s status as the only HAPS able to perform at length in the stratosphere

· Set a new world record for absolute altitude for this class of UAS at 76,100ft.

· Secured and exercised FAA flight approvals operating inside the US National Airspace System (NAS)

· Demonstrated successful flight with multiple payload integrations and tested new OPAZ payload, streaming Earth observation data

· Proved Zephyr can operationalize the stratosphere, achieving some 2,435 total flight hours and demonstrating precise stratospheric manoeuvrability and station-keeping over points on the ground.

Munich, 11th October 2021 – The Airbus Zephyr S completes a successful 2021 test flight campaign in the United States. The final Airbus solar-powered High Altitude Platform System (HAPS) flight touched down on 13th September in Arizona, USA, ending the most ambitious and successful Zephyr flight campaign to date.

The flight campaign had a clear customer focus - to demonstrate how Zephyr could be used for future operations, flying outside of restricted airspace and over airspace shared with commercial air traffic. Carrying an Optical Advanced Earth Observation system for Zephyr (OPAZ) payload, Zephyr proved its operational value to provide instant, persistent, and improved situational awareness.

“Working with Airbus and the Zephyr team during the 2021 flight campaign, significant progress has been made towards demonstrating HAPS as a capability. This summer’s activities represent an important step towards operationalising the stratosphere” said James Gavin, Future Capability Group Head at Defence Equipment & Support, the procurement arm of the UK Ministry of Defence.

“Defence investment in cutting edge technology is key to the development of world-leading military capabilities. Zephyr is an important programme within UK Strategic Command and the recent successful flight has required many innovative technical solutions. This represents a significant milestone for Zephyr which is informing the development of new concepts and ways of enabling military operations, particularly in the context of Multi-Domain Integration.” Said Major General Rob Anderton-Brown, Director Capability and MDI Change Programme at Strategic Command.

The campaign consisted of six flights in total, four low level test flights and two stratospheric flights. The stratospheric flights flew for around 18 days each, totaling more than 36 days of stratospheric flight in the campaign. This adds a further 887 flight hours to the 2,435 stratospheric flight hours for Zephyr to date, marks significant progress for fixed wing HAPS and is a step towards making the stratosphere an operational reality for its customers.

“Credible and proven ultra-persistence, stratospheric agility, and payload interoperability underscore why Zephyr is the leader in its sector. It is a sustainable, solar powered, ISR and network extending solution that can provide vital future connectivity and earth observation to where it is needed.” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus.

Such an innovative and potentially game-changing capability is part of Airbus ambition to rapidly move towards operationalizing the stratosphere. “Carbon Neutral”, Zephyr uses sunlight to fly and recharge its batteries, using no fuel and producing no carbon emissions.

With its ability to remain in the stratosphere for months at a time, Zephyr will bring new see, sense and connect capabilities to both commercial and military customers. Zephyr will provide the potential to revolutionise disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills. It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world’s changing environmental landscape and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world.

A330-200 MRTT Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) - Airforce Technology,"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2EzMzBfMjAwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airtanker A330-200 MRTT was selected as the UK’s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft. The UK procured 14 A330-200 MRTT aircraft to replace the RAF’s fleet of 26 VC-10 and Tristar aircraft. The FSTA programme was the world’s largest defence private financing initiative (PFI) arrangement.

The A330-200 MRTT is a new generation, combat-proven multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft manufactured by multinational aerospace and defence company Airbus.

In January 2004, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced the selection of the AirTanker consortium to provide air-to-air refuelling services for the British Army, Navy and Air Force, under the future strategic tanker aircraft (FSTA) programme. The AirTanker consortium comprises Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Babcock, and Thales.

The new tanker transporters, known as Voyager in the RAF service, replaced the RAF’s fleet of 26 VC-10 and Tristar tanker aircraft.

The MoD air-to-air refuelling programme will cover a 27-year service period and represents the world’s largest defence private financing initiative arrangement. The contract includes options to extend the service for a further period.

In addition to the UK, the aircraft is operated by several other countries. Airbus received orders for 61 aircraft and delivered 48 aircraft, to date.

Future strategic tanker aircraft (FSTA) programme

AirTanker was confirmed as the preferred bidder for the FSTA project in February 2005.

In June 2007, the UK MoD approved the private finance initiative (PFI) for the procurement of 14 A330-200 tankers.

Under the PFI, AirTanker owns and supports the aircraft, while the RAF flies the aircraft and has total operational control.

The UK MoD placed a 27-year contract for the 14 aircraft in March 2008. The maiden flight of the RAF’s first A330-200 took place in September 2010. The second aircraft took off on its first flight in October 2010. The first A330-200 MRTT entered service in June 2011. The delivery of the final aircraft under the programme was completed in July 2016.

VT Group, the support services integrator, is based at RAF Brize Norton. The RAF aircrew operate the aircraft for military services. When not in military service, the aircraft can be leased for commercial use and operated by civilian aircrew.

The fleet is managed in three groups. The majority is in full-time military service with the RAF.

Airbus A330-200 MRTT international orders

In April 2004, Australia also selected the A330-200 MRTT for the AIR 5402 requirement for five aircraft. The MRTT, designated the KC-30B, replaces Australia’s Boeing 707 tanker transporters. In June 2006, Airbus delivered the first A330 platform to EADS CASA in Madrid for conversion.

The first flight of the KC-30B for Australia took place in June 2007. Delivery of the first two A330-200 MRTT aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) occurred in June 2011.

The fifth and final aircraft was handed over to RAAF Base Amberley in December 2012. The RAAF A330-200 MRTT achieved initial operational capability (IOC) in February 2013.

The UAE selected the A330 MRTT in February 2007 and announced the procurement of three A330-200 MRTT aircraft in 2008. The first aircraft accomplished its maiden flight in April 2011 and was delivered to the UAE Air Force in February 2013.

UAE received the second and third A330 MRTT aircraft from Airbus Military in May 2013 and August 2013, respectively.

In January 2008, Saudi Arabia placed an order for three A330 MRTT aircraft, which are equipped with the EADS air refuelling boom system (ARBS) and hose and drogue refuelling pods. Three more A330 MRTT aircraft were ordered by the Saudi Ministry of Defence and Aviation in July 2009, bringing the total number of orders to six.

The first A330-200 MRTT of the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) completed its maiden flight in March 2011 and the first batch of three aircraft was delivered by early 2013.

The A330 MRTT aircraft formally entered service with the RSAF in February 2013. Delivery of the first two aircraft of the second batch took place in 2014, while the sixth and final A330 MRTT aircraft were delivered in June 2015.

In February 2008, the KC-30 (since re-designated the KC-45), a tanker based on the A330, was preferred for the US Air Force KC-X next-generation tanker requirement to replace the KC-135. Northrop Grumman led the KC-30 team, with EADS as a major subcontractor. In September 2008, the US Department of Defense upheld an appeal by competitor Boeing and cancelled the competition.

In January 2013, Airbus Military was selected as a preferred bidder by the Indian government to supply six A330 MRTT aircraft for the Indian Air Force.

The French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) placed a firm order for eight A330 MRTTs in December 2015 and a further three in December 2018. Designated as ‘Phénix’, the first aircraft was formally handed over in October 2018, while the delivery of the rest of the fleet will be completed by 2023.

In March 2018, Airbus received a revised contract for the delivery of eight A330 MRTTs, under the NATO Multi-national Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) programme, with options for additional aircraft. The first, second, and third aircraft were delivered in June, August, and November 2020, respectively.

The fourth A330 MRTT under the programme was delivered in April 2021, followed by the fifth in August 2021. The full fleet of nine MRTT aircraft will serve air-to-air refuelling, strategic transport, and medical evacuation needs of six participating countries, namely Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Norway.

The Republic of Singapore Air Force received its first A330 MRTT aircraft in September 2018.

In January 2019, the Republic of Korea Air Force received its first A330 MRTT, bringing the total in-service fleet count to 35.

Manufacture / conversion of A330-200 future strategic tanker aircraft

The standard A330-200 commercial aircraft manufacturing takes place at the Airbus manufacturing centre at Toulouse, while the conversion of the aircraft is performed at the company’s facility in Getafe, Spain, where it is fitted with refuelling systems and military avionics.

The aircraft can be fitted with two Cobham FRL 900E Mark 32B refuelling pods, one under each wing. The A330-200 wing shares the same design structure, including the strengthened mounting points, as that of the four-engine A340 aircraft. The wing positions for mounting the air-to-air refuelling pods, therefore, require minimal modification.

The aircraft’s fuel system includes the installation of additional pipework and controls.

The baseline commercial aircraft uses a configuration of very high-capacity fuel tanks in the wings, so modifications to the fuel tanks for the tanker transporter role are not required.

Other than the refuelling systems, the main areas of modification are the installation of plug-in and removable military avionics, military communications, and a defensive aids suite. The military systems will be removed when the aircraft is in commercial non-military use. The passenger cabin and the cargo compartment are unchanged.

The lower deck cargo compartment can hold six 88inx108in Nato standard pallets, plus two LD3 containers. The civil cargo load could be 28 LD3 containers or eight 96inx125in pallets plus two LD3 containers.

Mission capabilities of the A330-200 MRTT aircraft

The A330-200 MRTT has a sufficiently high cruise speed and sizeable internal fuel capacity to fly 4,000km, refuel six fighter aircraft en-route, and carry 43t of non-fuel cargo. Similarly, the

aircraft could give away 68t of fuel during two hours on station at a range of 1,000nm. The aircraft has a maximum fuel capacity of 139,090l, or 111t.

The high fuel capacity enables the aircraft to fly at longer ranges, to stay on station longer and refuel more aircraft, which increases the basing options and reduces forces reliance on host nation support. For the UK requirement, the aircraft is fitted with a hose and drogue system. However, it has a refuelling boom system for the Australian order.

The two-hour flight test included various approaches to the refuelling positions and exploring displacements vertically and laterally from the normal refuelling position. The trial was carried out between 15,000ft and 20,000ft and at 280kt, which is the middle of the Tornado’s refuelling envelope. Within this test envelope, there was minimum turbulence in the airflow astern the A330-200 and the Tornado’s handling qualities were very satisfactory in all tested positions.

In July 2018, Airbus performed the first ever automatic air-to-air refuelling of the A310 tanker with seven RAAF KC-30A MRTT. The company plans to perform the same operation with the A330 MRTT. In December 2018, Lockheed Martin and Airbus entered a co-operation agreement to develop the air refuelling capabilities of A330 MRTT.

The passenger cabin and the cargo compartment are unchanged. Even with a full fuel load, the aircraft can carry 45t of cargo and up to 300 passengers.

The aircraft can be used to perform aeromedical evacuation operations. The aeromedical evacuation configuration is equipped with two intensive care units (ICUs), 16 stretchers, 96 economy-class seats, 21 seats for medical staff, and cargo capacity in the lower deck.

The aerial refuelling boom system (ARBS) can be used to refuel receptacle-equipped aircraft such as F-35A Lightning II and F-16 Fighting Falcon. It has a maximum fuel flow rate of 4,542.49l /min (3,600kg/min).

The underwing pods on the aircraft have simultaneous hose and drogue refuelling capabilities with a refuel rate of 1,589.87l /min (1,300kg/min). The aircraft can be used to refuel probe-equipped aircraft such as A400M or C295 with the help of the Cobham 805E fuselage refuelling unit (FRU). The FRU provides the flexibility to perform simultaneous refuelling for two aircraft.

Further, the MRTT aircraft can be deployed as a support aircraft to meet the needs of four fighter aircraft.

AirTanker demonstrated the capabilities of the aircraft to act as an airborne communications node, while also performing its air-to-air refuelling tasks in March 2021. The new capabilities were made possible through the upgrade of the satellite communications system on the Voyager.

A330-200 flight deck

The flight deck of the A330 is similar to that of the A340. The tanker transporter aircraft’s cockpit has a refuelling officer’s station behind the pilot and co-pilot seats.

An electronic flight information system provides six large interchangeable displays with duplicated primary flight and navigation displays (PFD and ND) and electronic centralised aircraft monitors (ECAM). The pilot and co-pilot positions have sidestick controllers and rudder pedals.

The aircraft is equipped with an Airbus future navigation system (FANS-A), including a Honeywell flight management system and Smiths digital control and display system. The fly-by-wire computer suite includes three flight control primary computers and two flight control secondary computers, all operating continuously.

The UK tankers are fitted with the Northrop Grumman large aircraft infrared countermeasures system (LAIRCM).

Engines and performance of A330-200 FSTA

Two Rolls-Royce Trent 772B jet engines, each providing 71,100lb of thrust, power the Voyager aircraft. The aircraft for Australia use the GE CF6-80E1 engines, rated at 72,000lb thrust. The auxiliary power unit is a Hamilton Sundstrand GTCP 331-350C.

The main four-wheel bogie landing gear, the fuselage centre line twin-wheel auxiliary gear and the twin wheel nose units fitted with Goodyear tyres. The runway length for maximum take-off weight is 2,650m, and the ground turning radius is 43.6m.

Contractors involved

Cobham is a prime sub-contractor for AirTanker’s contract. It provides the air refuelling equipment, including the 905E wing pods and a fuselage refuelling unit. Cobham also supplies antennae, cockpit control systems, oxygen and fuel system units, and composite components for all Airbus A330 aircraft.

QinetiQ was contracted for aircraft certification. The QinetiQ AirTanker support team carried out an air refuelling trial of the A330-200 aircraft in October 2003.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",neutral,0.9999970197677612,0
Airbus explains design philosophy behind its CityAirbus NextGen - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2FpcmJ1cy1leHBsYWlucy1kZXNpZ24tcGhpbG9zb3BoeS1iZWhpbmQtY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1uZXh0Z2VuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Airbus unveiled its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL last week, the most striking thing about the aircraft was its lack of ambition. The piloted, fully electric air taxi has just three passenger seats, an expected range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) — targets well below those set by rival eVTOL developers including Joby Aviation, Beta Technologies, and Lilium.

CityAirbus NextGen’s performance targets are below those of most winged eVTOLs, but Airbus believes its simplified design will offer sufficient performance for 95% of UAM missions. Airbus Image

Nevertheless, the airframer is confident in its decision to prioritize simplicity over performance, Airbus Urban Air Mobility (UAM) head Joerg Mueller told eVTOL.com. When it comes to moving people within (as opposed to between) cities, he said, 80 kilometers of range is generally more than enough.

“If you over-design your vehicle, then the battery gets heavier, the vehicle gets heavier to operate, more expensive to operate, etc.,” he explained. “Simplicity with a certain level of performance is able to create a real value for our passenger in the city.”

That rationale is one of several competing theses that will be tested in coming years as legacy aviation players and aggressive startups race to define the UAM market. While eVTOL leaders like Joby expect to commercialize their air taxis a year or two ahead of Airbus — which is targeting certification with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) around 2025 — even a moderate delay in their complex certification programs could erase their first-mover advantage.

Airbus is betting that its simplified design will speed the technical development and certification of CityAirbus NextGen, in addition to offering advantages in reliability and operating costs. Although eVTOL.com initially described the aircraft as lift-plus-cruise, Mueller explained that the design is actually a winged multicopter.

Unlike lift-plus-cruise aircraft that have dedicated thrusters for vertical take-offs and landings and separate thrusters for forward flight, all of NextGen’s propellers are operational throughout the entire flight regime, including the two fixed-tilt propellers on the aircraft’s tail. Those propellers, which are also used for yaw control, provide an additional forward thrust vector in cruise flight, which is counteracted by the remaining propellers through a slight nose-up attitude in the hover.

Although NextGen has a wing, it never transitions to full wing-borne flight — which is how most winged eVTOL designs gain their superior cruise efficiency and performance.

Although the NextGen is different in appearance than the original CityAirbus demonstrator, the aircraft share similar design principles. Airbus Photo

Like the lumbering technology demonstrator that was the first to carry the CityAirbus name, control of NextGen will be achieved by varying the RPM of its eight propellers. Mueller said that Airbus’s experience with that 2.3-tonne (around 5,000-pound) demonstrator “makes us confident that we can live without tilting parts and moving surfaces.” That’s in contrast to the company’s other full-scale eVTOL demonstrator, Vahana, a tilt-wing aircraft that logged just over 13 hours of flight time across 138 test flights before the program was wrapped up in 2019.

Airbus plans to fly a NextGen prototype in 2023 using existing lithium-ion battery technology. Mueller said it’s too soon to say what type of cell chemistry will make it into the production aircraft, although Balkiz Sarihan, head of UAM strategy execution and partnerships, noted that Airbus is developing batteries as one of its core in-house technologies for applications across its product portfolio, including hybridized helicopters and satellites.

NextGen, which is being developed to meet the standards of EASA’s Special Condition (SC) VTOL enhanced category, currently has no provisions for safe emergency landing in the event of total power loss — meaning no gliding ability or ballistic parachute. Instead, Airbus will be required to demonstrate that the probability of such a catastrophic failure is vanishingly remote, on the order of one event in a billion flight hours. Mueller said he expects that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will accept this approach as well, although “as a European manufacturer, we’re starting with the European regulation,” he told eVTOL.com.

Defining the passenger experience

In arriving at its NextGen design, Airbus drew on its experience not only with the CityAirbus and Vahana technology demonstrators, but also with Voom, the helicopter seat booking service that operated in São Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City; and the San Francisco Bay area before shutting down in March 2020.

According to Mueller, the Voom experience demonstrated that “there are very strong dense passenger streams in and around cities . . . for example, from airports to certain points of interest or certain business districts.” He confirmed that the “sweet spot” for such missions seems to be around 25 miles (40 km), which is around what Joby is predicting for its average UAM mission length.

CityAirbus NextGen will have fixed rather than wheeled landing gear for weight savings and operational flexibility. However, exactly what those fixed skids or legs will look like is still being determined. Airbus Image

The 150-mile (240-km) range of Joby’s aircraft should allow it to do more of these missions at times of peak demand than CityAirbus NextGen, because it won’t need to recharge fully between flights. Even with a recharging requirement, however, Mueller said it should be possible to optimize the fleet and route network to sustain a viable business.

Although Airbus expects that NextGen will eventually be autonomous — and is actively developing the necessary technologies for that transition — the company is counting on conventionally piloted operations at the outset. The aircraft has a single pilot seat up front and a bank of three passenger seats, “each designed to have their own experience,” according to Sarihan. “We actually just had the opportunity to sit through the VR rendering of that last week and it’s really quite impressive,” she added.

Sarihan noted that Airbus’s designers are also paying close attention to accessibility, not only from a safety perspective, but also in terms of “the ease with which different people will be able to climb in and out of the vehicle” — which, along with affordability, will be key to offering a UAM service to the general public.

Rather than operate that service itself, Airbus expects to work with various operator partners to deploy CityAirbus around the world, drawing on its existing strong customer relationships. Sarihan suggested that Airbus’s established reputation will help set it apart from competitors in the space, as it comes with an “implicit degree of trust.”

“Our responsibility is that we are going to design vehicles to the highest operating levels, highest safety levels, and we will always be in a position where we are iterating with our operators,” she said. “That’s exactly how we develop any of our product portfolio — from the smallest helicopters to the largest jet.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6592957377433777}",neutral,0.6592957377433777,0
Seeking the most efficient flight - Episode 4 : sustainable taxiing on ground - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEwLXNlZWtpbmctdGhlLW1vc3QtZWZmaWNpZW50LWZsaWdodC1lcGlzb2RlLTQtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtdGF4aWluZy1vbi1ncm91bmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know that sustainable taxiing vehicles can significantly reduce CO2 and noise emissions during ground operations at airports? This is the idea behind the hybrid vehicle Airbus is currently testing during its ALBATROSS missions on ground.

Coordinated by Airbus in the Single European Sky ATM Research program (SESAR), ALBATROSS* is an initiative of major European aviation stakeholders to demonstrate how several solutions - covering all the flight phases including operations on ground and during the flight - can be combined and used all together to further reduce the environmental footprint of aviation in the short term. Through the various operational solutions put into practice during the ALBATROSS' missions, Airbus and its partners are exploring how we could optimize aircraft “Taxi-In” and “Taxi-Out” phases without use of jet engine power thanks to a semi robotic and hybrid towing vehicle. *: Please note that ALBATROSS is a separate initiative from the Airbus “AlbatrossOne” wing project.

Aircraft taxiing at airport with semi robotic and hybrid towing vehicle

“To move around an airport - from the terminal gate to the take-off point (Taxi-Out phase) and return it to the gate after landing (Taxi-In phase) - Aircraft mostly use their own engines, and as a consequence, consume fuels, emit CO2 and create noise at airports. And yet, that can be done differently with immediate effects on the environment” explain Nicolas Juillan, Safety & Security manager, and Nicolas Duval, Fuel Efficiency & Operations manager.

To achieve this, the Airbus Team is working on an alternative semi robotic and hybrid towing vehicle for aircraft taxiing assistance. The hybrid engine, controlled by the pilot from the cockpit using the regular pilot controls, can move an aircraft during Taxi-In and Taxi-Out operations without use of jet engines to get to and from the runway. Instead they use an alternative power source - diesel-electric - solution.

Many different partners are involved in this new taxiing approach : The handling agent is responsible for operating the vehicle before it has been attached to the aircraft and pushback, the pilot is responsible for operating the vehicle during Taxi-In & Taxi-Out phases and the airport infrastructure is responsible for the successful management of ground traffic.

By significantly reducing CO2 emissions and noise pollution while improving gates’ trafic efficiency and air quality at airports, hybrid taxiing assistance represents a major milestone in a more sustainable ground traffic management.

Towards a more sustainable ground traffic management

By enabling aircraft to turn off their engines during taxiing operations, the vehicle allows a reduction of noise emission and a reduction of fuel-burn and CO2 emissions up to 85% while improving air quality around airports as well. “For an A320 with 3 take-off per day from Paris Roissy Airport it represents 133t. of fuel and 500t. of CO2 saved per year” says Nicolas Juillan.

In addition to environnemental benefits, it makes cost savings for airlines and allows a reduction of engines Foreign Object Debris (FOD) up to 50% during Taxi-Out operations. For the airport it improves the gate efficiency through the reduction of wasted time during engine start-up at the gate area, paving the way for a more sustainable ground traffic management.

The vehicle capability is already certified on in-service Airbus aircrafts. Improvements are under development to remove current Cockpit HMI (Human Machine Interface) specificities and ease implementation for in-service aircrafts. This modification will be certified in forward linefit and retrofit. Certification is expected Q1 2022 and studies are already launched for A220.

“In the coming months we plan to perform 170 taxiing missions on A320 during the ALBATROSS demo-tour in Europe.

Five years after the Paris Agreement, the stakes have never been higher, and the aerospace industry is committed to playing its part by taking urgent climate action.

For nearly three decades, the United Nations has brought together almost every country on Earth for its annual Conference of the Parties (COP) on climate change. In October and November 2021, Glasgow will host the 26th conference – an important global milestone that many believe could be one of our last remaining opportunities to take significant action against global warming.

Indeed, COP26 marks five years since the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. As part of the agreement, 196 signatory countries agreed to work collectively to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions worldwide with the overall objective to limit global temperature increase this century to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to 1.5°C. In practice, the Paris Agreement works on a cycle of increasingly ambitious transformation, with each country submitting its own national climate action plan every five years.

Although specific action is defined by each country, industry has a major role to play in improving resilience to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The aerospace industry, in particular, is setting its sights on actively contributing to the Paris Agreement, notably by leveraging technology innovation to drastically cut its CO₂ emissions over the next three decades.

Airbus has already embarked on its decarbonisation journey for its portfolio of products – a crucial step in the company’s purpose to lead the journey towards clean aerospace.

Aviation commits to net zero CO2 by 2050

Today, aviation represents between 2% and 3% of global CO₂ emissions. There are no emissions-reduction targets for specific sectors in the Paris Agreement. Instead, the collective goal is to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, research shows that to hit this target, emissions from aviation, like other sectors, must be reduced close to zero and achieve net-zero greenhouse gases by 2050.

In October 2021, the aviation industry as a whole committed to precisely this target in support of the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal. Not only does this industry-wide commitment target a much more ambitious goal than previous goals, but it also firmly places climate action at the top of the industry’s priorities. New fuels, propulsion technologies and improvements in operations and infrastructure are expected to deliver the majority of reductions, with carbon removal measures capturing the rest.

To get there, a fundamental transformation of business as usual across the aviation industry – and beyond – is required. Airbus has already embarked on its decarbonisation journey for its portfolio of products – a crucial step in the company’s mission to lead the journey towards clean aerospace.

Leading the journey towards clean aerospace

Airbus fully understands that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of this generation. Rising to this challenge is rooted in the company’s sustainability commitments, which act as a guiding light for all company decision-making.

Today, climate action at Airbus is focused on the following four key areas:","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8031851053237915}",neutral,0.8031851053237915,0

During the flight test over the Toulouse region on 28 October, one CFM LEAP-1A engine of an Airbus A319neo test aircraft operated on 100% SAF. Initial results from the ground and flight tests are expected in 2022.

The unblended SAF is provided by Total Energies. It is made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which primarily consists of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats. HEFA is made of paraffinic hydrocarbons and is free of aromatics and sulfur. Approximately 57 tonnes of SAF will be used for the entire test campaign. It is produced in Normandy close to Le Havre, France. The 100% SAF will also be utilised for compatibility and engine operability studies on the Safran Helicopters Arrano engine used on the Airbus Helicopters H160, which are expected to start in 2022.

Airbus, in collaboration with DLR, is responsible for characterising and analysing the impact of 100% SAF on ground and in-flight emissions. Safran focuses on compatibility studies related to the fuel system and engine adaptation for commercial and helicopter aircraft and their optimisation for various types of 100% SAF fuels. Safran will perform LEAP engine ground tests with 100% SAF at its Villaroche facilities later this year to complete analysis. ONERA is supporting Airbus and Safran in analysing the compatibility of the fuel with aircraft systems and will be in charge of preparing, analysing and interpreting test results for the impact of 100% SAF on emissions and contrail formation. Dassault Aviation is contributing to the material and equipment compatibility studies and verifying 100% SAF biocontamination susceptibility.

The study – known as VOLCAN (VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux) – contributes to global decarbonisation efforts currently underway across the entire aeronautical industry, and is benefiting from a financing of the France Relance recovery plan, the part thereof dedicated to the decarbonisation of aviation, which is implemented by DGAC under the supervision of Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, French Minister of Transports. The study’s ultimate goal is to promote the large-scale deployment and use of SAF, and certification of 100% SAF for use in single-aisle commercial aircraft and the new generation of business jets.

The Japanese carrier is the first operator in the world to introduce the MFF between the two types.



MFF is unique to Airbus aircraft. As a result of flight deck and aircraft control systems it enables pilots to be certified to operate more than one type from the Airbus fly-by-wire product line on a regular and concurrent basis. At ANA this will enable crews to fly a mixed pattern of short and long haul services.

Airbus commonality extends from the flight deck into the passenger cabin as well, with a maximum use of similar systems, control panels and procedures within the various aircraft families. The unique level of technical commonality between Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft also streamlines maintenance procedures, resulting in significantly reduced costs.

“We are pleased that A320 and A380 MFF operations were approved by JCAB and that ANA has become the world’s first airline to introduce it ,” said Stéphane Ginoux, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan. “MFF offers airlines increased flexibility and cost-efficiency and has become one of the keys to Airbus’ success. For airlines, the increase in revenue hours flown by pilots due to less standby and downtime results in a significant improvement in productivity.”

MFF also enables airlines to interchange differently sized aircraft at short notice without crew-scheduling difficulties, allowing them to better match aircraft capacity to passenger demand.

With application areas ranging from homeland security and border monitoring, coastal surveillance and the fight against illegal trafficking to mining, geology, hydrology, disaster management and environmental protection, PerúSAT-1 gives an unprecedented boost to the development of downstream services in Peru.

In 2014, the Peruvian Space Agency CONIDA selected Airbus as the sole prime contractor for the PerúSAT-1 Earth observation satellite programme following a government-to-government agreement between Peruvian and French authorities. As the contract included an in-orbit delivery of its first satellite, Airbus contracted Arianespace to launch PerúSAT-1 on a Vega launcher from Kourou in French Guiana, which placed the satellite in its sun-synchronous polar orbit approximately 700 km above the Earth.

PerúSAT-1 is based on Airbus Defence and Space's AstroBus-S platform: the latest generation of high-end satellites designed for a 10-year lifetime.

It observes the Earth through the very-high-resolution optical NAOMI imager, designed and developed by Airbus Defence and Space. This silicon carbide optical instrument provides imagery in high or very-high resolution; in PerúSAT-1’s case 70 centimeters.

Digital Services continue its growth in North America

Toulouse, 13 October 2021 – Frontier Airlines has become the latest North American operator to adopt Skywise Health Monitoring as its key future fleet performance tool under a five year contract covering 111 single-aisle aircraft.

Launched in 2019, Skywise Health Monitoring (SHM) gathers live diagnostic feeds from the aircraft through its ACARS* link to the airline’s information system.

Frontier will use the solution for its A320 Family fleet. Airbus’ SHM will support the airline’s maintenance and engineering teams by enabling real-time management of aircraft events and troubleshooting. This will help the airline in identifying, prioritising, analysing and handling in-service events, enabling quicker decision-making and minimising AOG risks.

Using the power of the Skywise aviation data platform, SHM collates and centralises the alerts, flight-deck effects, maintenance messages etc., prioritises them, correlates any faults with the relevant troubleshooting procedures, highlights operational impacts, provides the maintenance history of the system (from the logbook and MIS** information collected through Skywise Core and stored in the data lake), allowing effective tracking of the alerts.

Overall, SHM saves airlines time and decreases the cost of unscheduled maintenance. Natively interfaced with Skywise Predictive Maintenance (SPM) and Skywise Reliability (SR) to provide an integrated user experience, and also ready to harness the new on-board Flight Operations and Maintenance Exchanger (“FOMAX”) data router which can capture over 20,000 real-time aircraft parameters, SHM enables end-to-end unscheduled event management/fixes, for example by anticipating tools and parts’ availability closest to the aircraft.

Airbus v Boeing in China: who has the upper hand? | Data - AeroTime,"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjkyMzItYWlyYnVzLXYtYm9laW5nLWluLWNoaW5hLWRhdGHSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI5MjMyLWFpcmJ1cy12LWJvZWluZy1pbi1jaGluYS1kYXRhL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Competition between Airbus and Boeing has been one of the defining features of commercial aviation for decades. These two aerospace giants dominate the market, and battle each other in every corner of the globe, wherever there is an opportunity to sell a commercial airplane.

However, China has decided to upend the status quo. In 2020, Chinese airlines postponed hundreds of deliveries from the two Western companies while increasing their reliance on COMAC – the domestic manufacturer known as the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China which, from the outset, has positioned itself as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing.

COMAC’s first airplane – the ARJ21 – is aimed at the regional market and does not really compete with the Western giants. However, the second one – the C919 – is intended to replace Airbus and Boeing’s most popular models – the A320 and the 737 respectively. While the C919 is yet to enter mass production, the model garnered more than 800 orders, mostly from Chinese airlines. Meanwhile, China, together with Russia, is working on a much larger aircraft – the CR929, intended to compete with Airbus and Boeing wide-body jets.

The Chinese market is one of the fastest-growing in the world, and is expected to remain so for quite a while. This is why Western manufacturers still rely on it, and expect to receive a proportion of orders from Chinese airlines.

But how likely is this? And how have Airbus and Boeing done in China in the past? Let’s take a look at the data.

Deliveries

It’s been a while since Boeing managed to deliver more aircraft than Airbus to Chinese airlines. But, in 2018, the American company finally took the lead. Its triumph was short-lived: the deliveries plummeted in 2019, and have since struggled to recover.

The reason for the fall of Boeing is well known: the 737 MAX disaster. Following two fatal crashes, Boeing’s newest aircraft was grounded worldwide, the deliveries stopped, and the company’s output – as well as its revenue – dropped to unprecedented lows. Narrow-body aircraft – primarily the 737 MAX – have comprised the majority of Boeing’s deliveries, and those stopped in 2019. As the chart below shows, China stopped receiving Boeing’s wide-body jets only in 2020 – at the same time as Airbus deliveries dropped.

However, Chinese companies didn’t rush to switch to an alternative by Airbus. In 2020, the C919 reached an important milestone: it was showcased in an airshow for the first time and began certification tests. Even the development of the CR929, despite some initial problems, moved forward. China had all the incentives it needed to gain confidence in its domestic aviation industry, and moved away from the Western manufacturers.

However, there were even earlier signs that this was going to happen.

Orders

China’s orders of Western jets started to fall after 2014. By 2018, the amount of Airbus and Boeing orders by Chinese airlines were virtually non-existent.

This paints a worrying picture for both Airbus and Boeing. And while it may seem like Airbus fared slightly better – it experienced a bump in 2019 – Boeing’s Chinese backlog is still marginally larger thanks to previous orders.

The chart above does not look that bad on its own – after all, 100 planes is a fairly substantial number. But it needs to be seen in the context of COMAC’s hundreds of orders, as well as the steep fall in deliveries.

Nevertheless, there is still something positive for Airbus and Boeing: China is about to recertify the Boeing 737 MAX, and, according to reports at the end of September, Airbus is discussing the possibility that China certifies the company’s most modern jet, the A220. But are these developments going to be enough?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9936327338218689}",neutral,0.9936327338218689,0

NIRSpec will study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in our Universe

Kourou, French Guiana, 18 October 2021 – Last stop, Kourou. The Webb Space Telescope (WST) has arrived at the European space port in Kourou, French Guiana. The spacecraft will now be prepared for its launch, scheduled for 18th December on an Ariane 5 launcher. One of the four instruments in its scientific suitcase is the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) built by Airbus in Germany.

Prior to launch, a complete functional test campaign will be carried out in October to make sure that every part of the spacecraft is still working as expected following its journey to Kourou. Airbus will actively support the final electrical functional tests of the four science instruments (including NIRSpec) that will last approximately six days.

“The Webb telescope will change the way we see the Universe,” said Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems. “Our contributions to NIRSpec and MIRI instruments are a testament to Airbus’ expertise and the value we can bring to modern astronomy. We are proud to have played a key part in the future discoveries of the Webb mission.”

Once in orbit, Webb will begin a month long journey, travelling four times the distance to the Moon, until it reaches its final destination, the Lagrange point L2, some 1.5 million km behind the Earth as viewed from the Sun.

Airbus will support NIRSpec from launch to commissioning (until the second quarter of 2022) by monitoring its parameters 24/7. This includes the period during the critical cool-down phase and then the initial functional testing when the NIRSpec instrument is turned on. Finally the Airbus engineering team will also continue to support during performance check out and calibration until the end of commissioning.

The NIRSpec instrument, weighing 200 kg, is a multi-object spectrograph capable of simultaneously measuring the near infrared spectrum of at least 100 objects like stars or galaxies with various spectral resolutions down to 0.3 nanometre. The observations are performed over the wavelength range from 0.6 to 5.0 micrometre. Once in operation, NIRSpec, known as the ‘super eye’, will operate at a temperature of -230°C. A team of more than 70 people at the Airbus sites Ottobrunn, Friedrichshafen and Toulouse worked on the design, development and finally the integration and test of NIRSpec, supported by 17 European subcontractors and NASA. The instrument was developed by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA).

Due to its excellent sensitivity, its high resolution, and its wide wavelength coverage, NIRSpec is a key instrument to achieve a deeper insight into the evolution of the universe. It utilises a highly a-thermal concept with all mirrors, the mirror mounts and the optical bench base plate all made from Silicon Carbide Ceramic SiC 100®.

Another instrument called Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) is also part of Europe’s contribution to the Webb mission. Airbus in the UK provided management, engineering and quality management for the European consortium that built MIRI to ensure there was a consistent approach to the design, build and test process. It covers the mid-infrared wavelength range from 5 to 28.3 microns. MIRI will be capable of penetrating thick layers of dust obscuring regions of intense star birth. It will see the first generations of galaxies to form after the Big Bang, and it will study sites of new planet formation and the composition of the interstellar medium. To ensure the signal from faint objects isn’t drowned out by the instrument’s own infrared glow, MIRI will be cooled down to -266°C, just 7°C above absolute zero.

With the NIRSpec instrument, Webb will study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in our Universe, when it was only a few hundred million years old. NIRSpec will be able to capture the spectra of typically 60 to 200 galaxies at a time, allowing scientist to observe in exquisite details how they formed and evolved. Much closer to us, NIRSpec will also be able to study the atmosphere of exoplanets, these planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. It will, in particular, search for the signature of key molecules like water.

Webb, the follow on mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), with its set of scientific instruments will allow looking further back in time compared to HST, mainly due to its higher sensitivity and a wider wavelength band, ranging between 0.6 and 27 micrometre. It is expected to yield astonishing breakthroughs in infrared space science. The $10bn Webb Space Telescope is a joint venture between the US, European and Canadian space agencies.

Review: Thrustmaster TCA Captain Pack Airbus Edition - FSElite,"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZnNlbGl0ZS5uZXQvY29udGVudC9yZXZpZXctdGhydXN0bWFzdGVyLXRjYS1jYXB0YWluLXBhY2stYWlyYnVzLWVkaXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thrustmaster first introduced the TCA Airbus Series in 2020 with the TCA Airbus Sidestick as their first entry into the civilian market. While Thrustmaster has produced a variety of sticks and flight sim hardware in the past, this was the first time they collaborated with an airline brand to create a bespoke model for a specific series of aircraft. The sidestick was then followed by the TCA Throttle Quadrant, which added engine starters and throttles as a separate product. Finally, the TCA Throttle Quadrant Add-On was released, enhancing the package further with flap, spoiler and other controls. Due to unforeseen circumstances, getting the hardware was extremely difficult for many, with some simmers able to get some of the hardware, but not all of it to make up the complete set. Whilst the newly released Thrustmaster TCA Airbus Captain’s Pack won’t solve the hardware availability problems, it will help those seeking the full set in one convenient package. How does it all tie together and is it worth the price? Let’s find out in this FSElite Review.

Inside the box, you have everything you will need. From the two control units (stick and throttle quadrant and add-on) to the manual and additional screws you may need. It was neatly packaged and a fitting “remove before flight” tag was placed over the contents on the covering sleeve. For those wondering, both the throttle quadrant and the sidestick are powered by 2 USB-A cables (the throttle quadrant is powered by a USB-C to USB-A cable).

The Airbus set is clearly designed around the iconic line of aircraft. Everything from the colours down to the ergonomics of the product have all been designed and inspired by Airbus aircraft. This is really evident, in my view, from the TCA stick. From a design standpoint, it looks almost identical to the real-world sidestick found on Airbus aircraft. Everything from the curves and ergonomics to the structure and button placement – all of it has been designed to replicate the real deal. Not only that, but it’s incredibly comfortable to hold. Place your hand around the stick and it feels perfectly natural.

Moving the stick there’s a nice amount of resistance that helps you feel like you’re being conscious of your input. That’s not to say there’s a silly amount of dead zone or that it feels unrealistic, far from it, but I’m trying to express that moving the stick doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy. Speaking of dead zones, I wasn’t able to identify much of one when using it on the default settings, and it reacted to my input almost immediately. To help ensure a long life with the product, Thrustmaster has included its H.E.A.R.T [technology] inside to ensure a precise movement every time. Ultimately this means that your stick won’t degrade or pick up nasty movement spikes in the future.

The sidestick itself also features one trigger button on the underside, a hat switch in the centre at the front and also two buttons on either side, representing the autopilot disengage (red) and push to talk (black) buttons. The stick covers all axis directions and also features a twistable rudder mechanism that can be used for rudder or nose wheel steering. You can also lock the rudder movement if you use rudder pedals. On the base, there are also 12 programmable buttons and a throttle slider which also has built-in reverse thrust mechanisms. However, as you have the complete throttle set in the package, you won’t have to worry about the throttle slider, which I do find sub-par in terms of quality thanks to its wobbliness. I do love the fact there are so many buttons on the sidestick as it gives plenty of options. Don’t fret as all the Sims I used had pre-configured controls for each of the buttons, but are all adjustable through their various menu options.

One thing that is really unique about the sidestick is the fact that you can swap out the top buttons to replicate either a right or left-handed stick. The ambidextrous design means regardless of your preference, you can comfortably enjoy the stick. Swapping the parts is easy and everything you need to use to do so is included.

The other half of the Captain’s Pack is the included TCA Quadrant and the TCA Quadrant Add-On. As mentioned earlier, inside the box, both of these components come pre-assembled, but you will need to use the included cables to connect the throttle section to the add-on part.

Looking over the unit itself, you can tell immediately that it has been modelled based on an Airbus aircraft. As with the sidestick, the colours, layout and design all resemble an Airbus aircraft. Without a doubt, the centrepiece of the unit is the throttle controls. They are big and dominant, but above all, they’re comfortable and fun to use. You can easily wrap your hand around them and feel a true sense of power when you push them forward into the TOGA position. They are nice and smooth the move and each of the detent gates have a nice satisfying click to them as you pass through them. My only complaint about the gates is that they don’t have enough resistance in each one. If you push forward past the CLB detent, it’s a little too easy to go past the gate itself. Knocking the throttles won’t push them out of position, but when the focus is on controlling the aircraft, I found myself pushing a little too far beyond what I desired to do. That said, the reverse mechanism is fantastic. You won’t be able to engage reverse thrust without first pulling up on the clips on the underside of the controls. From there, you can then bring them towards you and apply idle reverse or full reverse. When you go back to idle, the clips position back to their original place with a clunk reminding you they have been reset.

Alongside the throttles, you have the flaps and spoiler controls, which come from the add-on package. From the first glance, they look like very good replicas of the components used in the real aircraft. Both of them feel very solid and sturdy and feel really nice to move. I do, however, dislike the direction Thrustmaster went with the spoiler controls. Each quarter of the spoiler control has a detent, which, from my understanding, isn’t representative of Airbus aircraft. The spoiler lever should be a single movement from retracted to full. It’s also worth noting that the ability to arm the spoilers by pulling up the lever isn’t present. As for the flaps, there are detents for each of the four stages of flaps. However, despite the physical appearance of the spring-loaded pulley system (not the technical name) under the flap controls, there isn’t anything to operate and instead, you just need to move the flaps up and down.

Other controls on the unit include an AUTO BRK system with 6 stages of auto brake (more representative of an A380 with functions such as Brake to Vacate), a gear lever (up or down), engine start switches, parking brake and also a spring-loaded rudder trim switch. The gear lever was nice to use, and having physical engine start-up switches felt really nice to use when turning on the engines. Although all of the switches are functional and work just fine, there was a little bit of quality degradation, in my opinion. The engine starter switches felt a little flimsy, as did the parking brake. I don’t fear it breaking over time, but there’s just a noticeable difference between other controls on the unit.

As a complete unit, the whole set feels very complete. There are plenty of button combinations and uses. The unit is clearly designed for Airbus aircraft in any simulator you may use, but each of the controls can be adapted and set-up for any aircraft type. They’re fairly standard key-bindings and axis controls, so applying the controls to your favourite aircraft isn’t too complex.

Speaking of set-up, I was impressed with the simplicity of getting it to work in particular with Microsoft Flight Simulator. Clearly, the teams have worked together to provide accurate profiles for the default A320 in the simulator. You can literally plug in and play, and everything is set up on your behalf. My experience with the FlyByWire A32NX wasn’t as great, with some of the controls needing to be manually adjusted. Luckily, it only took a few minutes to get going and using the built-in EFB to help with the throttle detents made the process easier.

As for Prepar3D, this took a little longer. Using the FlightSimLabs A320-X, I was given a prompt when loading the aircraft to ask me if I wanted to apply the control options defined by FSLabs. I chose to do so and found that most of it worked fine. There was one issue where when applying TOGA power, the view changed to the spot-view. I also had to configure the spoiler and flap controls through the P3D control menu. Again, none of this was difficult or complicated – nor a problem with the hardware – but just goes to show how when there’s good collaboration, the process is incredibly seamless for the end-user.

Once everything was set up, using the controls was incredibly immersive. Actually having the chance to physically adjust the flaps, or use a proper reverse thrust throttle was sheer joy. We often talk about how the simulator or specific features make you feel immersed, but the TCA Captain’s Set helped bring that level of immersion for me to a new level.

From a pricing perspective, I feel as though the Captain’s Pack represents the best value out of the whole TCA series. With each component working well individually, and being priced accordingly as separate packages, having the whole set in one feels like a better proposition – especially for those who don’t own any of the components yet. The stick or throttle quadrant alone would feel like a lesser experience to me than having the set as a whole. Of course, if you already own a part of this set, then the Captain’s Pack isn’t for you (but I would highly recommend finding whatever may be missing). If you don’t have any of it, then this collection is certainly worth checking out as you get everything in one and ready to go straight away. Plus, there’s no guarantee you’ll find each of the different packages if you opt to buy the packs one at a time thanks to the current manufacturing and shipment conditions.

To sum up, I’m really pleased with the Airbus TCA Captain’s Pack from Thrustmaster. This is a well-realised and ambitious product that has come together nicely which creates an authentic experience for Airbus aircraft. To be able to have physical interaction with the controls that go beyond just standard button presses is extremely immersive and the simplicity around set-up makes this affordable package a win-win.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998701810836792}",neutral,0.9998701810836792,0

Global Medical Response orders 21 new Airbus helicopters - Airbus,"Thu, 07 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMC1nbG9iYWwtbWVkaWNhbC1yZXNwb25zZS1vcmRlcnMtMjEtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Grand Prairie, Texas, 07 October 2021 – Global Medical Response (GMR) will add a total of 21 Airbus helicopters from the H125, H130 and H135 families to its growing air medical fleet, with options to include up to an additional 23 helicopters, bringing the total order potential up to 44 helicopters.

“We fly a variety of Airbus products, but the main thing they have in common – and the most important thing we look for in our critical care transport solutions – is reliability,” said Rob Hamilton, president of the GMR Alliances Group. “Our Airbus fleet allows us to respond quickly and transport critical patients with the appropriate level of care to give them the absolute best chance of survival. With the addition of these new aircraft, our fleet grows stronger and more capable to save lives when it matters most.”

GMR, an industry-leading air, ground, specialty and residential fire services and managed medical transportation organization with more than 38,000 employees, is one of the largest operators of Airbus helicopters. GMR delivers care through multiple operating brands, including Air Evac Lifeteam, Guardian Flight, Med-Trans Corp., and REACH Air Medical Services. These operations transported more than 125,000 patients in 2020. This latest order will add to GMR’s current Airbus fleet of nearly 133 helicopters.

This announcement expands upon additional orders from GMR in recent years as part of an ongoing fleet expansion. In the past 18 months alone, GMR has taken delivery of 15 Airbus helicopters.

“The air medical mission demands high availability rates. The H125 and H130 set the standard in the single-engine segment, and the H135 has stood out in the twin-engine segment thanks to its consistent reliable performance in this mission,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region. “The fact that GMR’s entire twin-engine fleet is made up of the H135 speaks volumes to its success in the air medical market.

This A319neo is the latest to test 100% SAF - Airbus,"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEwLXRoaXMtYTMxOW5lby1pcy10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LXRvLXRlc3QtMTAwLXNhZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first in-flight study of a single-aisle aircraft operating on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has taken off. In doing so, the aviation industry inches one step closer to certification of 100%, unblended SAF for commercial use by 2030.

When the first A320neo took to the skies for the first time in September 2014, it immediately became world-renowned as one of the most efficient aircraft ever built. And it is not hard to see why: the A320 Family boasts the very latest engines and large wingtip devices, all of which contribute to making these aircraft up to 20% more fuel efficient than their predecessors.

Now, seven years later, the A320neo Family is adding to its already impressive list of environmental credentials: the A319neo has become the first single-aisle aircraft to operate on unblended SAF as part of an in-flight study.

It all happened on a pleasant autumn day in October. The A319neo test aircraft departed Toulouse’s Blagnac airport with one of its CFM LEAP-1A engines running on 100% SAF for a first clearance test flight that lasted three hours. Clearance tests are used to ensure that the aircraft meets all applicable safety and performance requirements before further test flights can occur.

“The flight went smoothly,” David O’Nions, Airbus Lead Flight Test Engineer and Pilot, says. “There was no difference in engine behaviour, which gives us confidence that 100% SAF provides comparable performance to conventional jet fuels.”

The study, known as VOLCAN (“VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux”), is a joint project between Airbus, Safran, Dassault Aviation, ONERA and the French Ministry of Transport. Through this collaboration, the partners are looking to analyse the compatibility of unblended SAF with single-aisle aircraft and commercial aircraft engine and fuel systems – an important milestone that takes the aviation industry one step closer to certifying 100% SAF for commercial use by 2030.

At Airbus, we understand we need to go beyond CO2 emissions to gain a more complete picture of aviation’s full climate impact.

Tim Leigh, VOLCAN Project Lead

The untapped potential of unblended SAF without aromatics

The 100% SAF – which is not mixed with any fossil fuels – is a critical part of the VOLCAN in-flight test campaign. This SAF is made from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which generally consists of used cooking oil and other waste fats.

HEFA is made of paraffinic hydrocarbons and is free of aromatics and sulfur. There are a number of benefits to unblended SAF without aromatics. For example, reduced aromatics lead to a reduction in soot particles. As a result, the number of ice crystals that compose contrails can also be reduced. By operating on 100% SAF without aromatics, the aircraft could thus significantly reduce its climate impact.

“The great thing about HEFA is that it has no aromatics,” explains Tim Leigh, VOLCAN Project Lead. “We specifically selected to test this type of SAF as part of the VOLCAN project due to its high potential to have a positive impact on non-CO2 emissions compared to other types of SAF. At Airbus, we understand we need to go beyond CO2 emissions to gain a more complete picture of aviation’s full climate impact.”

From clearance testing to in-flight emissions performance testing

The clearance test was the first in a series of in-flight tests to come. The next step is in-flight testing of 100% SAF’s emissions performance in November 2021.

The VOLCAN project is one of two 100% SAF climate-impact initiatives that are a part of Airbus’ overall roadmap to achieve certification for the entry-into-service of 100% SAF on the Airbus fleet. The two projects are complementary and enable Airbus to test the use of 100% SAF for both its wide-body and single-aisle aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996457099914551}",neutral,0.9996457099914551,0

"Airbus to expand freighter conversion lines to U.S., China - FLYING","Wed, 20 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWZyZWlnaHQtY29udmVyc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared on FreightWaves.com.

By year’s end, Airbus plans to open a production line in the U.S. for converting used A321 passenger jets into freighters as part of an expansion strategy that will triple output by 2024 for the narrowbody aircraft and the larger A330, according to a company official.

The company is setting up a new conversion line in San Antonio for the smaller A321 program that is scheduled for completion in December. It also plans to establish production facilities in China and the U.S. for the A330 reconfiguration in 2022, spokeswoman Anke Lemke told FreightWaves.

Investments by the aircraft manufacturer, and aftermarket competitors, are designed to address rapidly growing demand from express delivery and regular all-cargo operators with heavy shipment volumes.

Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore’s ST Engineering, is increasing its capacity to the point that it’ll be able to produce about 60 converted aircraft per year for conversion—about 30 each for the A330 and the new A321 narrowbody conversion programs—by 2024. That’s up from the 19 conversions it expects to carry out this year, Lemke said.

In each of the planned production expansions, EFW will partner with existing airframe repair facilities.

What it Takes

Converting used aircraft into cargo configuration is a complex engineering task that requires extensive design work before cutting a large cargo door in the fuselage for loading containers on the main deck, as well as reinforcing the floor, adding a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit and installing a cargo handling system for maneuvering containers.

Nearly all of EFW’s production slots for the A330 have been booked through 2026, and the company is fully booked through mid-2024 for the A321 program, Lemke said.

In August, BBAM Limited Partnership placed an order with EFW for 18 passenger-to-freighter conversions of the A321, the largest order so far for new aircraft. EFW delivered its first A321 a year ago and has only converted a handful of the small jets into pure cargo aircraft so far.

EFW said at the time that many of the conversions for BBAM will be carried out at ST Engineering’s airframe facility in the U.S. The company previously said that ST Engineering will be adding an A321 conversion line at its VT Mobile Aerospace facility in Mobile, Alabama.

Why This Matters

Analysts expect the A321 to be in high demand because of its ability to carry small containers in the lower deck, which makes loading and unloading faster, and its 15 percent greater fuel efficiency compared to the Boeing 737-800, its most direct competitor that has been in the market for nearly four years.

Feedstock for the relatively young aircraft type is also high because of the pandemic’s damage to airlines, which have an incentive to move out of late-model airplanes because the A321 passenger version is still being produced by Airbus.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999973773956299}",neutral,0.9999973773956299,0

Our satellites and tracking systems help make oceans safer with solutions that monitor and protect naval routes and maritime assets. Airbus-built aircraft are instrumental in firefighting, public safety and maintaining energy systems. Our products are the workhorses that carry out construction and infrastructure projects in local communities. And technology solutions from Airbus protect many critical systems from cyberattacks, helping maintain their integrity when it’s needed most.

The workhorses for construction and infrastructure

As true workhorses in tough environments, Airbus products perform heavy lifting when needed most. From assessing project locations with satellite imaging to delivering materials at difficult-to-access construction sites or providing on-scene live coverage of an unfolding event, Airbus products respond to a wide array of critical needs for all types of projects.

Mitigating risk with 3D satellite imaging The development of many– especially those in remote areas with limited geological and topographic data – require highly accurate data to assess a project’s feasibility. Airbus’ satellite technologies provide precise digital elevation models to make decisions that help ensure the endeavour’s success. Once a project is initiated, satellite imagery can help monitor the construction’s progress as well as providing information on its possible impacts on soil and or water quality – ensuring that projects are carried out in strict compliance with environmental standards and safety regulations.

Delivering materials and supplies to remote areas The helicopter is often the only tool able to transport heavy loads, building materials, supplies, cargo…and more in hostile or inaccessible areas.Every Airbus helicopter version is designed to carry heavy-duty aerial cranes.

Protecting and maintaining power lines The use of helicopters for construction, surveillance and maintenance of electrical transmission grids provides vital services that keep the power on for communities around the world.Helicopters have multiple advantages in this type of aerial work, including the ability to visually inspect approximately 300 km of power lines per day from the air, rapidly detect any potential problems, and reach difficult or inaccessible areas.

Safely delivering harbour pilots Large harbours that serve as hubs for global trade often are difficult and potentially dangerous for large shipping vessels to navigate. Many require specially-trained harbour pilots who know the waters and terrain to safely bring the ship to dock. Compared to boats, helicopters can transfer these pilots to vessels arriving at ports faster and safely, with the pilot being set down directly on the deck – eliminating the need for freeboard climbing, thereby making the journey even safer.

Newsgathering when time is critical When news happens and information is needed, helicopters are on the scene in minutes to provide live coverage of everything from natural disasters to police pursuits. Knowledge is key, and helicopters can arrive at difficult-to-access locations to document unfolding events and provide the public with the information they need to know.

Public Safety

Safety throughout the community is the goal of public service agencies around the world. The men and women charged with upholding public safety rely on Airbus products for their critical missions, as deployed by local police to the coast guard, search teams, SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams and customs officials.

Helping keep our communities safe with helicopters Helicopters play a key role in ensuring safety within a community. When disaster strikes, helicopters often are first on the scene, assessing damage or casualties, providing evacuation services, critical infrastructure checks and quick reaction force deployment when an emergency situation arises. If a person goes missing, helicopters are called upon to search large areas quicker and more effectively than ground patrols.

Helping the helpers with secure communications Public safety organisations, such as police forces, firefighters and healthcare facilities must work together on their overlapping responsibilities – requiring them to share information and work in close coordination to ensure community health and safety. This requires reliable and efficient communication and collaboration solutions, allowing secure operations and interoperability between multiple organizations. For over 30 years, Airbus has been a trusted partner for public safety organisations. Our field-proven and tailored solutions equip customers to handle any situation.

Last year, we successfully located 62 missing people, all still alive, but people who might well have died without the help of our police helicopter unit. - Martin Landgraf, deputy chief of Germany’s Baden-Württemberg’s police helicopter unit

Energy

Helicopters are essential to keep our energy systems running. From renewable energy such as offshore wind farms to traditional energy sources like oil and gas, these rotorcraft are key components that maintain the energy industry’s operations at the optimum output.

Sustaining oil and gas operations Traditional energy sources like oil and gas depend on helicopters to transfer crew, equipment, and medical services, along with conducting inspections and providing repair services. Offshore platforms that are difficult to access count on the speed and reliability of helicopters. Land-based rigs in highly remote locations also require helicopter services for logistics support as well as pipeline patrols to ensure safety and environmental protection.

Weather conditions in the North Sea can be tricky. Even if the wave height is really high where boats can no longer deliver mechanics to the wind parks, the helicopter is still able to do this job. - Dennis Roggeveen, a pilot for Helicopter Travel Munich (HTM).

Firefighting

Wildfires are increasingly becoming larger, faster-spreading, and more difficult to control. Climate change is one reason for this. The hotter global temperatures have created drier conditions, sapping vegetation’s moisture. The depopulation of rural environments and the shift away from mountain living, as well as human actions, are some of the factors that make the new generation of fires more difficult to control. Firefighting, traditionally considered to be just one of the many aerial roles of helicopters and aircraft, is now becoming one of their most critical tasks, especially in summer.

Essential aircraft combating wildfires Every minute counts when a fire breaks out. Helicopters offer the speed and ability to reach the scene quickly, dousing fires with water-bombing systems that can deliver some 800 to 4,000 litres of water every two to three minutes when a water source is nearby for refills. Early intervention with the use of helicopter-delivered water drops can slow down a fire’s progress and help in its containment. When fixed-wing aircraft are called upon, especially for larger fires, helicopters can continue their work – supporting the teams on the ground by carrying equipment, personnel, or urgently needed water.

When a fire breaks out, helicopters offer the best way to reach the scene very quickly. Therefore, this is the solution that we look to first. - Denis Bargès, Head of the Bouches-du-Rhône fire service’s Forest Fire Group Doctrine and Flight Service in France

Cybersecurity

Major cyberattacks have the power to paralyse organisations and have become a daily menace. They can threaten national security, upend our healthcare systems, or wreak havoc on the digital tools we rely on in our everyday lives: such as clean water systems, local power grids and more. The severity of attacks underlines their potential impact on Europe’s economy and society, annually estimated at 340 billion Euros. To counteract this threat, Airbus has developed agile solutions to protect companies, governments and critical infrastructures. Over 170,000 security applications from Airbus are used worldwide, which are overseen by the company’s Airbus CyberSecurity business and its staff of 600 employees.

The job of the Security Operations Centre manager is to guarantee the security of the theatre's information systems. We detect and neutralise any cyber threat to enable the BARKHANE Force to use the full extent of its digital resources, factors of operational superiority. In short, to guarantee the Force's freedom of action - Lieutenant Philippe, Head of a French military Security Operations Centre (SOC) that relies on Airbus defensive cyber warfare technology

Trade

The aviation industry has an almost incalculable contribution to global trade and economic development, supporting more than 65.5 million jobs around the world. Airbus alone provides employment to over 130,000 employees, and more than 12,000 international partners and suppliers.

Airbus-built freighter aircraft open up borders worldwide – providing vital connectivity links, facilitating trade and economic growth to serve a myriad of communities. Hand in hand with our customers, these freighters support companies to boost productivity, enabling the transport of a full range of cargo – from high-value consumer goods to express packages and perishables, as well as medical supplies.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7227908968925476}",positive,0.7227908968925476,1
Lufthansa Group leases further Airbus A350-900 long-haul aircraft - newsroom.lufthansagroup.com,"Mon, 04 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1ncm91cC1sZWFzZXMtZnVydGhlci1haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDAtbG9uZy1oYXVsLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lufthansa Group is accelerating the modernization of its long-haul fleet. The Group signed leases for four state-of-the-art and fuel-efficient Airbus A350-900 aircraft with the lessors Avolon, SMBC Aviation Capital Ltd. and Goshawk. As a result, the Group's A350 fleet will grow to 21 aircraft at the beginning of 2022.

The Airbus’ A350-900 are scheduled to enter service with Lufthansa's core brand from the first half of 2022, strengthening the five-star airline's premium offering.

Dr. Detlef Kayser, Member of the Executive Board Deutsche Lufthansa AG, said:

""The Airbus A350 is one of the most modern aircraft of our time. Extremely fuel-efficient, very quiet and much more economical than its predecessors. Our customers appreciate not only the sustainability but also the premium flight experience with this aircraft. The lease agreements allow us to remain flexible in fleet planning and make the most of exceptional market opportunities.""

The twin-engine Airbus A350-900 aircraft consume only around 2.5 liters of kerosene per passenger per 100 kilometers flown. That is around 30 percent less than their predecessors, with a correspondingly positive impact on the carbon footprint. The aircraft will primarily replace four-engine long-haul aircraft from the Airbus A340 family. By the middle of the decade, the proportion of four-engine aircraft in the long-haul fleet as a whole is expected to fall to below 15 percent. Before the crisis, the share was around 50 percent.

Furthermore, the new, fuel-efficient aircraft will reduce operating costs by around 15 percent compared with the types they will replace.

As part of its comprehensive, long-term fleet modernization program, the Lufthansa Group will take delivery of a total of further 177 short-, medium- and long-haul aircraft this decade.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999847412109375}",positive,0.9999847412109375,1
"Airbus to expand freighter conversion lines to US, China - FreightWaves","Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdG8tZXhwYW5kLWZyZWlnaHRlci1jb252ZXJzaW9uLWxpbmVzLXRvLXVzLWNoaW5h0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy10by1leHBhbmQtZnJlaWdodGVyLWNvbnZlcnNpb24tbGluZXMtdG8tdXMtY2hpbmEvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Updated Oct. 25, 2021, 9:05 A.M. ET)

Airbus plans to open by year’s end a production line in the U.S. for converting used A321 passenger jets into freighters as part of an expansion strategy that will triple output by 2024 for the narrowbody aircraft and the larger A330, according to a company official.

Investments by the aircraft manufacturer, and aftermarket competitors, are designed to address rapidly growing demand from express delivery and regular all-cargo operators with heavy shipment volumes.

Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between Airbus (DXE: AIR) and Singapore’s ST Engineering, is increasing its capacity to the point that it will be able to produce about 60 converted aircraft per year for conversion — about 30 each for the A330 and the new A321 narrowbody conversion programs — by 2024. That is up from the 19 conversions it expects to carry out this year, spokeswoman Anke Lemke told FreightWaves.

The company is setting up a new conversion line in San Antonio for the smaller A321 program that is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. It also plans to establish production facilities in China and the U.S. for the A330 reconfiguration in 2022, Lemke said. In each case EFW will partner with existing airframe repair facilities.

On Saturday, Oct. 23, VT San Antonio Aerospace, one of ST Engineering’s U.S. facilities, announced on LinkedIn that it has welcomed its first A321 for the new modification line.

Converting used aircraft into cargo configuration is a complex engineering task that requires extensive design work before cutting a large cargo door in the fuselage for loading containers on the main deck, as well as reinforcing the floor, adding a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit and installing a cargo handling system for maneuvering containers.

EFW, Dresden, Germany, has only converted a dozen A330s so far (nine -300 variants plus three -200s) because the aircraft is still relatively young. DHL has received eight of the conversions and has orders for 20 more, Cargo Facts has reported. More of the medium-size widebodies are available at reasonable prices now because cost-cutting passenger airlines, aligning fleets to lower travel demand and preferring newer planes that burn less fuel, are discarding many of them. There are about 500 A330s in storage, according to Leeham News.





Nearly all of EFW’s production slots for the A330 have been booked through 2026, and the company is fully booked through mid-2024 for the A321 program, Lemke said.

In August, BBAM Limited Partnership placed an order with EFW for 18 passenger-to-freighter conversions of the A321, the largest order so far for new aircraft. EFW delivered its first A321 a year ago and has only converted a handful of the small jets into pure cargo aircraft so far. EFW said at the time that many of the conversions for BBAM will be carried out at ST Engineering’s airframe facility in the U.S. The company previously said that ST Engineering will be adding an A321 conversion line at its VT Mobile Aerospace facility in Mobile, Alabama.

Analysts expect the A321 to be in high demand because of its ability to carry small containers in the lower deck, which makes loading and unloading faster, and its 15% greater fuel efficiency compared to the Boeing 737-800, its most direct competitor that has been in the market for nearly four years. Feedstock for the relatively young aircraft type is also high because of the pandemic’s damage to airlines, which have an incentive to move out of late-model planes because the A321 passenger plane is still being produced by Airbus.

More competition

Earlier this month, Israel Aircraft Industries announced plans to launch an A330 freighter conversion program with support from leasing company Avolon, which ordered 30 modifications for planes it will supply.

EFW rival 321 Precision Conversions recently announced that Greenwich Highland Aviation is an early adopter of its version of the A321 freighter. The aircraft leasing company will send it two A321-200s in 2022 for conversion work, with the first reconfiguration commencing in January. Airframe reassembly will be conducted by licensed partner HAECO Americas in Lake City, Florida, using 321 Precision’s modification kit.

Greenwich Highland will lease the two cargo jets to Global Crossing (X) Airlines, a startup passenger and cargo airline based in Miami. GlobalX said that the first A321 freighter is scheduled to enter service in July followed by the second aircraft in December. The company has leased a total of four aircraft but did not indicate which engineering house will transform the additional aircraft in 2023.

321 Precision is a joint venture among Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG), which owns cargo airlines, a leasing company, and an engineering outfit that specializes in Boeing 737 conversions, and Precision Aircraft Solutions of Beaverton, Oregon, which made a name converting Boeing 757 aircraft. The company received Federal Aviation Administration approval in April for its design to structurally modify the A321 with a wide cargo door and other features, so it can carry heavy cargo on the main deck.

Meanwhile, French-Luxembourg aviation company Vallair recently delivered its third A321 freighter to SmartLynx Malta, the new cargo subsidiary of Latvian passenger charter operator SmartLynx. The plane was the first A321 cargo conversion done in China, where EFW opened its second production facility last spring.

SmartLynx is operating the freighters under contract with package carrier DHL Express.

Vallair, which went through EFW for conversion work, delivered the world’s first A321 freighter to Qantas Freight a year ago.

The air cargo sector is experiencing extremely strong growth, heavily driven by e-commerce, time-sensitive and high-value cargo such as COVID vaccines, massive backlogs in ocean shipping, and growth in international trade.

Vallair estimates the market for A321 converted freighters could number in the hundreds over time.

“Many of the men and women who build the Lakota in Mississippi are U.S. military veterans themselves, and they take a lot of pride in supporting the aviators who serve our nation,” said Scott Tumpak, who is responsible for Airbus military helicopter programs in the U.S. “The million-hour milestone is a testament to the commitment of that workforce who has supported unprecedented on-time deliveries and to the reliability and versatility of the aircraft they build.”

Airbus delivered the first Lakota helicopter to the Army in 2006, the same year the UH-72A was competitively selected as the Army’s new light utility helicopter, and has since delivered 463 of this initial Lakota model which primarily serves as the U.S. Army’s initial entry rotary- wing training helicopter. Earlier this year, the Army introduced the first UH-72B Lakota to its National Guard fleet, the first delivery of an order placed in 2020 for 18 of the newest Lakota variant. The UH-72B is based on the widely successful H145, which incorporates various product enhancements that have been developed during the lifecycle of the commercial aircraft. The efficient Fenestron tail rotor, more powerful engines, enhanced controls and the Airbus Helionix avionics suite, to name a few, will provide added benefits for mission safety and flight performance.

By the end of October 2021, the Lakota will be operational for Army and National Guard units in 45 states and territories. It is also flown by the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and Royal Thai Army, and is a key enabler of U.S. Army combat training in Ft. Irwin, CA, Ft. Polk, LA and Hohenfels, Germany, and as well as the test range mission at the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. The Lakota’s missions are as varied as its operating locations, and include training, general utility, search and rescue, disaster response, homeland security, drug interdiction, command and control, and VIP transport. Lakotas have been employed extensively in responding to wildfires, hurricanes, floods and other disasters across the country and abroad in recent years, including most recently to provide support following devastating natural disasters in Haiti.

With nearly 10 different configurations available, the Lakota delivers proven performance, outstanding operational reliability, and unmatched versatility for a broad spectrum of military missions. Airbus Helicopters, Inc. builds the Lakota at its production facility in Columbus, Mississippi, which employs a workforce of nearly 250 employees, 40% of whom are U.S. veterans.

Airbus in Bremen leads the European team on behalf of ESA

The second Airbus-built European Service Module (ESM) for NASA’s Orion spacecraft is ready for delivery from the Airbus site in Bremen, Germany. An Antonov cargo aircraft will fly the ESM-2 to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA. The European Space Agency (ESA) has selected Airbus as the prime contractor for the development and manufacture of six ESMs with the first ESM soon to fly on NASA’s Artemis I mission.

The ESM is a key element of Orion, the next-generation spacecraft that will transport astronauts beyond low Earth orbit for the first time since the end of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. The module provides propulsion, power and thermal control and will supply astronauts with water and oxygen on future missions. The ESM is installed underneath the crew module and together they form the Orion spacecraft.

“Delivery of the second European Service Module for NASA’s Orion spacecraft marks another huge step forward on the journey to return astronauts to the Moon. Working hand in hand with our customers ESA and NASA, and our industrial partner, Lockheed Martin Space, the programme is moving apace and we are ready to meet the challenges of returning to the lunar surface in 2024,” said Andreas Hammer, Head of Space Exploration at Airbus.

ESM-2 underwent a comprehensive validation process prior to being readied for shipment including gimbal testing of the module’s main engine (which swivels from side to side for manoeuvring and directional control during spaceflight). This main engine is a refurbished engine from Space Shuttle Atlantis.

After completing its trans-Atlantic voyage, ESM-2 will be mated with the Orion Crew Module and undergo further extensive testing before integration with the launcher – a process that will take around two years.

The launch of the first Orion spacecraft on NASA’s new Space Launch System rocket will be uncrewed and take the spacecraft more than 64,000 kilometres beyond the Moon in order to demonstrate its capabilities. The first human spaceflight mission, Artemis II, will be powered by ESM-2.

The design of the Orion spacecraft enables astronauts to be transported further into space than ever before. The spacecraft will transport four astronauts, providing life support for the crew during the flight and enabling a safe return to Earth’s atmosphere, at extremely high re-entry speeds.

The ESM comprises more than 20,000 parts and components, from electrical equipment to engines, solar panels, fuel tanks and life support materials, as well as several kilometres of cables and tubing.

The ESM is a cylinder around four metres high and wide. Comparable to the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV 2008 – 2015), also built by Airbus, it has a distinctive four-wing solar array (19 metres across when unfurled) that generates enough energy to power two households. The service module’s 8.6 tons of fuel can power the main engine, eight auxiliary thrusters and 24 smaller thrusters used for attitude control.

At launch, the ESM weighs a total of just over 13 tons. In addition to its function as the main propulsion system for the Orion spacecraft, the ESM will be responsible for orbital manoeuvring and position control. It also provides the crew with the central elements of life support such as water and oxygen, and regulates thermal control while it is docked to the crew module. Furthermore, the unpressurised service module can be used to carry additional payload.

In the longer term it is planned to dock Orion spacecraft with the International Lunar Gateway – a Moon orbiting platform that will enable a sustainable space exploration architecture extending humanity’s presence in space.

The jet launched in late 2020 and the seventh TwoTwenty will be delivered to a U.S. customer toward the end of 2022.

Using the first digital Airbus cabin configurator, Airbus Corporate Jets is allowing customers to walk through cabins and explore more than 120 layout options. The details of the personalized configuration can then be downloaded to assist with choices.

“The TwoTwenty stands out in the new ‘Xtra Large Bizjet’ market,” explained Sylvain Mariat, head of Airbus Corporate Jets Creative Design. ""The ACJ TwoTwenty is a complete aircraft-cabin offer to customers.” It offers three different ambiences across six living spaces.

Airbus states that the ACJ TwoTwenty will have an intercontinental range of up to 5,650 nautical miles, with more than 12 hours flight time. According to Airbus Corporate Jets, the TwoTwenty provides more than twice the cabin space of business jets in its class.

Airbus Corporate Jets also recently announced a partnership with French artist Cyril Kongo to jointly design a new cabin concept, focused on “delivering comfort, connectivity and functionality in one space, and turning the extra-large bizjet into a flying contemporary art gallery.”

In addition, Airbus Corporate Jets showcased the ultra-long-range ACJ319neo for the first time at NBAA BACE. The ACJ319 carries up to 19 passengers in four distinct cabin zones.

Airbus is also seeing continuing recovery on the rotorcraft side.

In the first half of 2021, Airbus Corporate Helicopters has registered 43 global orders for its aircraft, compared to 63 for all of 2020. The 2021 figure is spread among five models (ACH125, 130, 135, 145, and 160). The ACH160 model has received certification in Europe and Brazil, and the company continues to work with the FAA toward U.S. certification.

In a commitment to a future of cleaner aviation, Airbus Corporate Helicopters stated that its full current fleet is certified to run with a blend of up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel. In addition, the ACH145 was the first Airbus helicopter to run on full SAF during a June flight in Germany.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995524287223816}",neutral,0.9995524287223816,0
Airbus Zephyr breaks more aviation records during flight testing - Aerospace Testing International,"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9mbGlnaHQtdGVzdGluZy9haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLWJyZWFrcy1tb3JlLWF2aWF0aW9uLXJlY29yZHMtZHVyaW5nLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0aW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ Zephyr high altitude platform system (HAPS) has achieved a new world record in terms of altitude during an extended flight testing program this summer in the USA.

​​

The solar-powered Zephyr-S high altitude platform system (HAPS) flew in the stratosphere for 36 days across two 2021 flights and set a new world record for absolute altitude for this type of aircraft UAS at 76,100ft. The Zephyr already holds the world record for the longest duration flight for a stratospheric aircraft of 26 days.

The Airbus flight test team secured and exercised FAA flight approvals to operate the HAPS inside the US National Airspace System (NAS) and demonstrated that Zephyr can be operated with multiple payload integrations, including a new OPAZ (Optical Advanced Earth Observation system for Zephyr) payload.

The campaign consisted of six flights in total, four low level test flights and two stratospheric flights. The stratospheric flights flew for around 18 days each, totaling more than 36 days of stratospheric flight in the campaign and adding 887 flight hours to its total time in the air.

Zephyr-S has now flown for 2,435 flight hours and demonstrated precise stratospheric manoeuvrability and station-keeping over points on the ground.

James Gavin, future capability group head at Defence Equipment & Support, the procurement arm of the UK’s Ministry of Defence said, “Working with Airbus and the Zephyr team during the 2021 flight campaign, significant progress has been made towards demonstrating HAPS as a capability. This summer’s activities represent an important step towards operationalizing the stratosphere.”

Jana Rosenmann, head of unmanned aerial systems at Airbus said,“Credible and proven ultra-persistence, stratospheric agility, and payload interoperability underscore why Zephyr is the leader in its sector. It is a sustainable, solar powered, ISR and network extending solution that can provide vital future connectivity and earth observation to where it is needed.”

The Zephyr-S has a 25m wingspan and weighs 75kg (165lbs) it has been in development at Airbus since 2013, but was originally created by UK-based defence company QinetiQ in 2003.

Airbus is aiming for Zephyr to be used initially in the defence sector to provide communications and ISR and plans to offer the stratospheric aircraft for use commercially and for disaster management. This could include monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills and providing communications in unconnected regions, the company has said.

The climate mission supporting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals will fly on Bartolomeo, the Airbus external payload hosting platform.

The winning ‘ClimCam’ team consists of specialists from different fields and symbolizes the power of international cooperation, bringing together researchers from three institutions: the Egyptian Space Agency, the Kenyan Space Agency, and the Uganda National Space Programme within the Ugandan Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation.

Jointly, the team will develop a remote sensing camera system to monitor weather, floods, and impacts of climate change in East Africa. The three institutions have agreed to an open data policy, sharing information and images acquired from the project to guide climate change mitigation efforts across the entire region. In addition to its direct goals, the project will also demonstrate space technology developments made in Africa, inspiring African engineers and scientists.

UNOOSA Director Simonetta Di Pippo said: ""Together with Airbus, and thanks to the ingenuity of the brilliant selected researchers, we are making it possible for this module made in Africa to fly onboard the ISS. This project will acquire precious insights for the East African region to address pressing challenges such as droughts and floods and increase the resilience of its agricultural sector, potentially saving many lives and helping to build a better future. It will also be an important inspiration for talent in Africa to join the space sector. We are extremely proud to have played a role in making this happen, and we look forward to seeing the project take flight.”

”We are very pleased to welcome this UNOOSA-backed team with their African climate mission as a passenger on the Bartolomeo platform,” said Andreas Hammer, Head of Space Exploration at Airbus Defence and Space. “Of course, we are offering them our Bartolomeo All-in-One Space Mission Service, meaning that our own experienced Space experts will take care of all aspects of this Space mission – preparatory formalities, payload launch and installation, operations and data transfer. This way, the team can fully concentrate on the development and exploitation of their environmental monitoring payload, without having to worry about anything else. This is one of the fundamental benefits of the Bartolomeo Service – we make access to space easier than ever before.”

“We are very happy to win this opportunity in such a world class competition, the team would like to introduce gratitude to the UNOOSA and AIRBUS for this opportunity,” said Ayman Ahmed, Team leader at the Egyptian Space agency and ClimCam project coordinator. “Of course, we understand that challenges exist in our region; climate change is having a growing impact on Africa, especially in the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, and stress on water resources in east Africa as well. Having an imaging system at ISS allows us to monitor and see that effect in our home countries. We do realize the challenge of developing such a device to operate on board the ISS with very critical and challenging design constraints.

“The competition was very hard, but being awarded this opportunity is just the beginning for our team to learn more and acquire great experience in the field of space technology and its application.”

This is the first time the UN has selected a winner for an opportunity to access space in partnership with a private sector company. For more information about Bartolomeo and its potential for reducing the space divide, please visit: www.airbus.com/bartolomeo

Boeing and Airbus freighter battle - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8yOC9ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItYmF0dGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Oct. 28, 2021, © Leeham News: Boeing yesterday gave its clearest indication yet that it’s moving closer to launching the 777X Freighter.

In a message to employees in conjunction with its third quarter earnings release Oct. 27, CEO David Calhoun said, “We’re progressing in development across several key franchise defense programs, and on the 737-7, 737-10 and 777X development and certification efforts. We’re also evaluating the timing of a freighter version of the 777X and are beginning to lay the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program.” News reports earlier suggest Boeing may launch the XF at the Dubai Air Show.

On the earnings call, Calhoun was slightly more expansive. “Given the continued robust freighter demand and the compelling economics of the 777X, we are currently evaluating the timing of launching a freighter version of our 777X airplane.”

Inching toward the 777XF

Calhoun said that cargo traffic is 8% higher year-to-date through August compared to 2019.

“With limited belly cargo capacity on passenger airlines, more dedicated freighters are being utilized to transport cargo. This is resulting in healthy demand for our freighter offerings, with 24 additional freighter airplanes ordered in the quarter and strong demand for Boeing converted freighters. In fact, our converted and new freighter orders through the first nine months of this year have already surpassed our highest annual freighter tally in history,” Calhoun said. “With sustained demand for air cargo tied to expanding e-commerce and air freight’s speed and reliability, we project the global freighter fleet in 2040 will be 70% larger than the pre-pandemic fleet.”

Airbus A350F

Airbus launched the A350F in July. But it didn’t announce launch customers or specifications. These are expected soon.

In an interview during the IATA AGM Oct. 3-5 in Boston, Christian Scherer, Airbus’ chief commercial officer, said the A350F is being offered to all-cargo and combination carriers. The latter are airlines that operator passenger and cargo services. These include airlines such as Air France, Korean Air Lines and Singapore Airlines.

The A350F, which is based on the A350-1000, has the same MTOW as the A350-1000, but it’s slightly shorter. It has the same engine, same wing, and same landing gear. There is some structural reinforcement, Scherer said.

“What matters to us is that we get good input from the customers that have convinced us to develop an airplane and introduce competition to a market that lacked competition. That we get input from those to finalize the specification, the capabilities of the airplane, the cargo loading system, the exact dimensions of the linings, and this and that,” said Scherer.

At Airbus’ third quarter earnings release today, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said “The decision to launch the A350F freighter is an available market decision. The freighter market is growing and we want to participate. With changed environmental rules from 2028, there is a large replacement market that we want to participate in from 2025.”

Airbus hasn’t had a lot of success with freighter aircraft. The end-of-life A300-600R became a dedicated freighter and some A310s were built with cargo doors. Airbus whiffed with the proposed A380F for technical reasons and a realization that loading from at the upper deck in a high wind wasn’t going to work well. The industrial delays also helped kill the A380F.

The new-build A330-200F also flopped. Only 38 were sold. Scherer, who participated in the decision to launch this aircraft, said Airbus should have used the larger A330-300 with its greater volumetric payload as the basis for a new production airplane. The aftermarket conversion has more than 100 slots reserved at EFW, a joint venture of Airbus. Most are for the -300. IAI Bedek recently launched its own A330ceo conversion program.

"Hydrogen planes won't take off until 2050, Airbus has admitted to the EU - Euronews","Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXh0LzIwMjEvMDYvMTAvaHlkcm9nZW4tcGxhbmVzLXdvbi10LXRha2Utb2ZmLXVudGlsLTIwNTAtYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1hZG1pdHRlZC10by10aGUtZXXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European manufacturer admitted to EU officials hydrogen tech wouldn't be ready by 2035, as it had earlier claimed.

ADVERTISEMENT

Most passenger planes will continue to burn fossil fuels until at least 2050, with the introduction of zero-emissions hydrogen limited to smaller regional and short-range planes, Airbus told European Union officials in a private briefing earlier this year.

The presentation – revealed publicly for the first time on Thursday – came after Airbus claimed it would release a range of hydrogen-fuelled airliners by 2035, in a widely-publicised release last September.

The company has not publicly said whether hydrogen technology will be ready in time for the European industry's next major milestone - a replacement for the medium-haul A320 in the 2030s - but February's briefing to EU officials appeared to rule this out.

""Zero-emission hydrogen aircraft will be primarily focused on regional and shorter-range aircraft from 2035. Which means that current and future iterations of highly efficient gas turbines will still be required as we move towards 2050, especially for long-haul operations,"" the presentation said.

Also on Thursday, a leading climate researcher told Euronews that using hydrogen-derived fuels for short flights could have a bigger carbon footprint than using regular fossil-fuel kerosene.

Slides from the presentation to the office of European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans were released by InfluenceMap, an investor-led climate lobbying watchdog which said it obtained them through a freedom of information request.

""It is not yet decided what market segment the first zero-emission aircraft will target,"" an Airbus spokesperson said on Thursday, declining to comment further on the February meeting.

Is hydrogen that green?

Researcher Falko Ueckerdt from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) told Euronews he was not surprised by Airbus' presentation to EU officials.

""Directly using hydrogen comes with handling challenges that decrease the passenger capacity and range of hydrogen planes. The energy density of hydrogen per weight is high, while the the energy density per volume is low,"" he said.

Direct electrification should come first to assure a safe future for all Gunnar Luderer Climate researcher, PIK

A recent report co-authored by Ueckerdt highlighted another potential issue in Airbus' presentation: using hydrogen-based fuels for the smallest planes would be much less energy efficient than electrifying them.

""The low energy efficiency of hydrogen and e-fuels is a major challenge. This requires that the input electricity is really clean and sustainable, as their carbon and environmental footprint is basically multiplied when converted into hydrogen or e-fuels,"" Ueckerdt said.

""This means that electricity should be 100 per cent low-carbon (e.g. renewable) and carbon for e-fuels should be non-fossil (e.g. from direct air capture) the carbon and environmental footprint can be higher than those of current fossil kerosene,"" he told Euronews.

Ueckerdt's co-author Gunnar Luderer went further.

""As international and national climate targets require immediate emission reductions, from a climate perspective direct electrification should come first to assure a safe future for all,"" he said in a statement.

Airbus decarbonisation decision in 2025

Industry officials have played down the prospect of a switch to hydrogen for the A320 family's replacement because of the aircraft's size and range, and infrastructure needed globally. Airbus says an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds.

Airbus says the research will in any case seed disruptive technology likely to play a role in the next generation of airplanes.

As an interim step, the company and others have called for more widespread use of sustainable fuels in existing planes.

But Ueckerdt told Euronews that so-called ""sustainable aviation fuels"" had limited potential, as they required the extensive of biomass – meaning plant and waste products – to produce.

""A more scaleable option are e-fuels, that is synthetic fuels based on electricity-based hydrogen and atmospheric carbon. While the required technologies such as electrolysis and direct-air capture are in their infancy, policy support, industry investments and future innovation can bring down costs and scale up quantities after 2030,"" Ueckerdt said.

In February's presentation, Airbus displayed industry forecasts suggesting the A320's medium-haul category of 150-250 seats would be powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) first, and ""potentially some hydrogen"" from 2050.

A smaller niche between 100-150 seats, which includes its A220 aircraft, would use electric power, hydrogen and/or SAF from 2040, while only regional 50-100 seaters would be ready for hydrogen in the 2030s.

In September last year, Airbus presented three concepts for a hydrogen plane to enter service in 2035 including a turboprop, a traditional-looking twin-engined plane powered by hybrid-hydrogen engines and a more radical blended-wing body aircraft.

Airbus has said it will choose the final product for a new decarbonised plane in 2025. The briefing said it would also narrow down the choice of broad concept as early as mid-2022.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996565580368042}",neutral,0.9996565580368042,0

"Airbus Services highlights recovery opportunity, digitalisation - Runway Girl Network","Sun, 24 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXNlcnZpY2VzLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtcmVjb3Zlcnktb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktZGlnaXRhbGlzYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft services is big business: in 2019 during its last Global Markets Forecast, Airbus predicted a services market of some US$4.9t over the twenty years to 2038, or some $250b a year. But like the rest of the industry, the services market was hit hard by the COVID-19 drop in traffic in 2020-21, with up to a two-thirds reduction in some areas.

Runway Girl Network attended a briefing session with three senior vice presidents — head of Airbus customer services Klaus Roewe, customer services innovation and digital solutions’ Lionel Rouby, and training and flight operations services’ Valerie Manning — for an update on the services market during the pandemic and how the airframer is responding.

Over the last 20 months where passenger numbers dropped 60%, Airbus cites a concomitant drop in maintenance of 40%, aircraft upgrades by 66%, and 50% in full flight simulator training use.

Airbus expects maintenance and training to lead recovery — some 100,000 new pilots and 175,000 new technicians will be required — with upgrades as the last segment to recover, while some new opportunities have emerged around end-of-life services and recycling, trading of used serviceable material, and digital products.

But that’s just part of the services world, with Airbus categorising the services market around four primary areas of work, which it calls clusters: to train, to operate, to maintain, and to enhance.

Training includes both cabin and flight deck crew training, the Airbus flight academy, maintenance training and simulation products.

Operations covers fleet efficiency solutions for in-service aircraft, system upgrades, flight operations products from subsidiary NAVBLUE, and support and consulting work in the flight operations sphere.

On maintenance, this includes flight hour services, materials management by subsidiary Satair, maintenance expertise and consulting services, ground support equipment and tools, lease transition and aircraft recycling.

The “enhance” category, meanwhile, features upgrades, cabin and connectivity improvements, and comfort & safety.

Digitalisation is clearly at the front of mind across these clusters, however. Responding to a Runway Girl Network question, Lionel Rouby was clear that “digitalisation is one of the most important technology drivers to improve the way we deliver services.

“We live in a world where we need to expedite the decision making processes, we need to be faster and more efficient in collecting information, and digitalisation is a great means to have handy all the relevant information that will allow the decision makers to take the most relevant [decision].”

“On top of that,” he noted, “with artificial intelligence, with machine learning, we can also help decision-makers with some recommendations in order to have less gut-feeling decisions [and] more data-based decisions.”

In addition, the way that aircraft manufacturers design aircraft has changed, is changing and will continue to change. Airframers getting into the services business means that they have a direct interest in making maintenance and other services work more efficiently. In essence, where before the cost pressure was at one step removed (from the service provider to the airline and/or owner and then to the airframer) now the airframer is itself the service provider. There’s an inherent and direct benefit now to reducing ongoing costs.

“The early consideration of services of service ability even in a product design is in itself a technological innovation,” Klaus Roewe argues. “When you see for example, [that] an A320neo has 10% lower maintenance costs than an A320ceo, why is it like that? Because it was requirements — for sure fed by in service experience — fed into the design of the product. When you do it at the outset of the design, for sure you can get much more efficiencies than if you would have to do it afterwards.”

Airbus’ services offering seems to be persuasive for airlines: a 111-aircraft deal with Frontier Airlines for aircraft health monitoring was announced on the same day as the briefing session, while a week later Finnair took Flight Hour Services provision for its 35-strong A320 family fleet, covering nose-to-tail spares, engineering and repair services.

Order intake for the segment stands at 10.1 billion euros ($11.8 billion). The company highlighted defense orders of 56 C295 aircraft for India, two A400Ms for Kazakhstan and support and spares contract renewals for the German and Spanish Eurofighter fleets.

Airbus Defence and Space reported 2.3 billion euros in revenue ($2.7 million) for Q3 in the company’s financial results released Thursday. For the nine-month period, the segment has broadly stable year-on-year revenues.

Overall, Airbus saw a 6% dip in revenues for the quarter, which the company said was driven by lower commercial aircraft deliveries and less favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher revenues at Airbus Helicopters. Revenue was 10.5 billion euros for the quarter ($12.3 billion). Net income was 404 million euros, ($472 million).

Yet for the nine-month period, revenue for the full company is up 17% at 35.2 billion euros ($41 billion), because of higher commercial aircraft deliveries compared to the same time period in 2020.

“The nine-month results reflect a strong performance across the company as well as our efforts on cost containment and competitiveness. As the global recovery continues, we are closely monitoring potential risks to our industry. We are focused on securing the A320 Family ramp up and striving to ensure the right industrial and supply chain capabilities are in place,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury.

Airbus raised its guidance to adjusted EBIT of 4.5 billion euros ($5.3 billion), up from 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in the prior quarter. Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing is expected to be 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion), up from 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in the prior quarter.

In the company’s financial results report, Airbus reported that employees of Airbus Defence and Space GmbH in Germany potentially received “improper advance receipt and communication of confidential customer information” related to future German government procurement projects. The self-disclosure by the Company followed an internal review with the support of an unnamed law firm.

Airbus Defence and Space GmbH was fined 10 million euros by federal prosecutors in Munich for “negligent violation of supervisory duties” in connection with this matter. Airbus said that it is fully cooperating with the investigation.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999680519104004}",positive,0.9999680519104004,1

World Food Day: Airbus' H125 helps protect East African crops from desert locusts - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTEwLXdvcmxkLWZvb2QtZGF5LWFpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LWhlbHBzLXByb3RlY3QtZWFzdC1hZnJpY2FuLWNyb3BzLWZyb20tZGVzZXJ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Celebrated each year on 16 October, World Food Day commemorates the creation of United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) – which has led the international fight against hunger since 1945. The article below is one example of how Airbus and its products are supporting those in need.

Savannah Helicopters H125s each flew 70 to 80 hours a month to locate swarms of desert locusts in Ethiopia.

The 2020-2021 desert locust crisis has been devastating due to favourable weather conditions, resulting in the destruction of East Africa’s crops and food resources. Combatting it requires 24/7 surveillance to spot the swarms of insects and their non-flying offspring in the act of devouring fields of grain and coffee.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is behind efforts to monitor and fight the locust outbreak, and is drawing on numerous resources, including a trio of Airbus H125 rotorcraft operated by Savannah Helicopters – which won a tender in collaboration with Zemen Flying Services, a local Ethiopian operator, to conduct survey flights in Ethiopia to locate the insects.

Locust swarms in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya hitch a ride on eastern winds, moving across the region in numbers that reach 50 million per hectare. Covering several hectares, the locust threat to human food security is high.

Their coming can look like a pink smudge on the horizon as they quickly cover up to 200 km in a day. In 24 hours, they eat their own weight in grains like teff, millet and khat. When they take off again, they leave behind human starvation.

The H125s first had to be ferried from Savannah Helicopters’ base in South Africa. An early attempt was cancelled when the continent went into lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The locusts continued their advancement, and Savannah Helicopters made a second attempt across Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi and Kenya, and eventually to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

As if a 22-hour flight wasn’t enough, the crews had to bed down in tents beside the helicopters at night to avoid quarantining at each stop – in compliance with COVID-19 protocols.

The H125 is a member of Airbus’ rugged and proven Ecureuil family.

After a 10-day isolation on arrival, the crews were stationed at three bases in Ethiopia, where they encountered the locusts. “You see them clearly because they’re dense. One of our pilots flew around one of these swarms and they could calculate the area: it was 35,000 hectares. That’s enormous,” said Conrad Maree, Savannah Helicopters’ owner.

From April to June 2021, each helicopter flew 70 to 80 hours a month. Working with an FAO coordinator, Savannah’s teams went to remote areas where swarms go overlooked. Locals contributed to sightings, leading to investigations that sometimes required the H125s to land in sandy unprepared sites.

The locust threat to human food security is high in Ethiopia.

“The helicopters performed without any major snag and never disappointed,” said Maree. “There’s a lot of high and steep terrain. Historically, we’ve operated the Ecureuil in worse areas and they’ve never let us down.”

“We are very proud to see the H125 involved in the combat against the desert locust swarms in East Africa,” said Gilbert Do Nascimento, Airbus South Africa Managing Director. “The H125 is a versatile platform capable of conducting a broad array of missions for the benefit of local populations, especially in Africa. We are standing by Savannah’s side making sure they receive the necessary support to conduct their vital missions.”

The H125 has earned its reputation as a true multi-mission workhorse, with built-in manoeuvrability, excellent visibility, and low vibration levels in the cabin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995200634002686}",neutral,0.9995200634002686,0

Scandinavian Airlines will apply Airbus’ Skywise Health Monitoring solution across its entire A320, A330 and A350 family fleet of 78 aircraft.

“We are very pleased to see our long-time partner Scandinavian Airlines join the Skywise family. We firmly believe that with Skywise and SAS' continual push for innovative solutions we will see them propelled to new levels of productivity and efficiency. I want to warmly thank SAS for their trust and confidence.” said Charbel Youzkatli, Head of Airbus Commercial Services Europe.

Skywise Health Monitoring will support Scandinavian Airlines’ maintenance and engineering departments to identify, prioritise, analyse and handle in-service events. This enables quicker decision-making and aircraft on-time dispatch while also minimising ‘aircraft on ground’ risks, helping the airline save time and reduce the cost of unscheduled aircraft maintenance.

By adopting Skywise, Scandinavian Airlines will integrate their own operational, maintenance, and aircraft data into the Skywise cloud, so the carrier can store, access, manage, and analyse selected Airbus data, together with own data as well as global benchmarks without the need for additional infrastructure investments. This resulting value will provide new insights at aircraft, fleet and company level while allowing the operator to enhance their operations through access to OEM expertise and global fleet context.

Skywise is a key element of Airbus’ digital transformation. It is an enterprise data platform driving digital collaboration across the aerospace value chain by capturing information from all upstream processes, including design, engineering, manufacturing and combining it with in-service data and maintenance support. Skywise is accelerating digitalisation in aviation by providing players across the sectors with the data and capabilities to make better operational decisions.

Successful deployment of giant reflector for forest monitoring satellite Biomass - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMC1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWRlcGxveW1lbnQtb2YtZ2lhbnQtcmVmbGVjdG9yLWZvci1mb3Jlc3QtbW9uaXRvcmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stevenage 21 October 2021 – Biomass, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) forest measuring satellite has passed a key milestone with the successful deployment of the Large Deployable Reflector (LDR) which will receive P-band data reflected back from the world’s forests.

The test, which took place at L3Harris Technologies in Florida who manufactured the 12m wide reflector, was witnessed by representatives from Airbus, ESA and JPL (NASA).

Chris Lloyd, Biomass Project Manager at Airbus Defence and Space said: “Successful deployment of the largest Earth observation reflector is a major move forward for Biomass. We are on track for launch in 2023 following the successful structure and mechanical tests earlier this year.”

Michael Fehringer, ESA’s Biomass Project Manager said: “It was great to witness the huge reflector being deployed successfully and is testament to the unique collaboration of the industrial teams in Europe and the USA as well as the co-operation between ESA and NASA/JPL.”

Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said: “With COP26 just around the corner, the UK is leading the way in using space to monitor climate change, with companies like Airbus at the heart of developing satellites that give scientists access to valuable information about our planet.

“The Biomass mission will greatly enhance the quality of data on the world’s forests. I was privileged to see the satellite taking shape in Stevenage recently and very much look forward to the launch in 2023.”

The 12-metre reflector will be key to the first space-borne P-band synthetic aperture radar, P-band is the longest radar wavelength available to Earth observation. Biomass, which is an ESA Earth Explorer mission, will measure forest biomass to assess terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes for five years.

The spacecraft will deliver exceptionally accurate maps of tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomass and changes in the biomass stock over the five year mission lifetime that are not obtainable by ground measurement techniques. In arid areas of the planet, it will see right through to the underlying bedrock, enabling mapping of the rock structure and search for subterranean reservoirs of water.

It is expected the LDR will be shipped to ESA´s prime contractor Airbus in Stevenage for integration on the spacecraft at the end of 2021. Biomass is due to launch in 2023 on a Vega launcher from French Guiana.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6126819849014282}",neutral,0.6126819849014282,0

id you know that increasing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has the potential to support the aviation industry’s long-term climate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050? This is the idea behind SESAR’s Albatross* SAF work package Airbus is currently working on.

*: Please note that ALBATROSS is a separate initiative from the Airbus “AlbatrossOne” wing project.

In this third instalment of our series of articles on SESAR’s Albatross very large demonstration (VLD) project which will explore and demonstrate the most fuel-efficient flights through a series of gate-to-gate live trials across Europe, we put the spotlight on the work package for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) led by Airbus.

Towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050

SAF is one of the aviation industry’s four decarbonisation pillars, which also include improved technologies, market-based measures, more efficient aircraft operations and improved infrastructure. It has the potential to support the aviation industry’s long-term goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Increasing the use of SAF in all commercial aircraft is therefore a necessity. To support this trend, some Albatross live trials will use SAF. Overall this is expected to contribute to the promotion of SAF, as well as support the emergence of a market for SAF, encouraging future investments while helping to maintain a level playing field for aviation.

The actual fuel to be used as part of Albatross trials will be a “JetA/A1” SAF blend. It will be composed of synthetic and conventional blend components.

The uptake of SAF in Albatross VLD will help to ‘oil the wheels’ of the entire SAF value chain, from the production plant to point of use. It will also provide an opportunity for stakeholders to explore the potential chain of custody for SAF integration, from direct use to ‘dematerialisation’. Last but not least, it will help promote decarbonisation solutions by illustrating how combining multiple decarbonisation measures can contribute to climate-neutral flight.

Here’s How the World’s Biggest Aircraft Maker Plans to Tackle eVTOLs - Robb Report,"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL3dvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LWFpcmNyYWZ0LW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlci1ldnRvbHMtMTIzNDY0Mjg4OS_SAWJodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL21vdG9ycy9hdmlhdGlvbi93b3JsZHMtYmlnZ2VzdC1haXJjcmFmdC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXItZXZ0b2xzLTEyMzQ2NDI4ODkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, the European air-transport giant, recently introduced its newest foray into the eVTOL world. The CityAirbus Next Gen follows the company’s single-seat, tilt-rotor Vahana and a first-generation ducted-fan multi-copter, also dubbed CityAirbus. The new vehicle is a four-seater, but looks sleeker, with six propellers mounted on a swept-back wing and two additional rear-thrust propellers on a V-shaped tail.

It’s projected to hit a top speed of 75 mph with a range of 50 miles, both on the low end of performance specs in the category, which raised questions about Airbus’ vision.

To get answers, we caught up with Joerg Mueller, the company’s head of urban air mobility. He gave Robb Report a deeper look at what the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer has in mind.

What’s the focus of the Next Gen and why is it the right solution for that mission?

The vehicle has been designed to fly missions in and around cities, mainly for passenger transport as well as for tourist flights with a low environmental footprint. CityAirbus Next Gen could also be used by medical services to connect remote areas with little infrastructure. We expect that these types of missions will generate a strong demand, e.g., between airports and business districts. It provides a clear value-add compared to ground transport options where the average driving speed is generally well below 7 mph in rush hour.

The design has been optimized for both flight performance and simplicity. The missions it targets allow the design to be built with no moving surfaces or tilting parts, which in turn ensures easier maintenance. The vehicle has good take-off and landing performance while optimizing sound levels during these phases, which will be a key factor in public acceptance.

This project is a bit of a departure from your previous concepts. What did you learn that made you decide that this would be the best direction?

This vehicle would not have been possible without the previous demonstrators. The CityAirbus demonstrator allowed us to prove that a vehicle in the two-ton class can be controlled through differential propeller thrust only.

We also gained experience in designing electrical drive trains and advanced flight controls, quantified noise emissions, and explored the flight domain using wing-borne flight with the Vahana. Based on this, we have chosen the simplicity of a multi-rotor configuration combined with the flight performance of a winged vehicle.

The projected performance stats, including passenger capacity, seem rather modest compared to other designs. Is that by design?

Indeed, we have designed it with sustainability in mind, tailoring it to its mission instead of trying to set speed or range records, which would only add weight and increase the need for larger batteries. A vehicle with four seats is optimal because no one will have to wait too long for all guests to arrive, embark, etc, while also providing good use of the limited airspace and landing site capacity.

We think it’s not that useful to fly very quickly on an urban mission if your time gain is only a few seconds or minutes in the overall door-to-door commute. It also lets us keep the technological hurdles manageable: The vehicle will be in the two-ton class and require only several hundred of kWs of power, a level at which the industry already has experience. We are convinced, based on our experience with the two demonstrators and with Voom [the company’s on-demand helicopter taxi service], that operators and passengers will benefit from this optimized design.

What’s the calendar for development and where should we expect to see it first?

The prototype of the CityAirbus Next Gen will fly in 2023 and we expect it to pave the way for certification that could happen as early as 2025. Entry into service will happen gradually, but we do not expect that operations will be available at scale before the end of the decade, as the ecosystem to enable operations also has to be built.

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is not just a technological endeavor—it is the coming together of multiple players who believe that this can offer an additional layer to the mobility solutions that their cities have to offer and one that is truly respectful of the environment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.97905033826828}",neutral,0.97905033826828,0

Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. and Airbus SE, a European multinational aerospace company, are jointly entering the satellite business to capture the burgeoning private-sector aerospace market.According to defense and aerospace industry sources on Sunday, KAI Chief Executive Ahn Hyun-ho and Bernard Brenner, an Airbus executive vice president in charge of marketing and sales, have signed an initial agreement to cooperate in the development of value-added small low-earth-orbit satellites.The two companies will launch a task force by the end of this year to look for business opportunities in the fast-growing small satellite market, the sources said.The move comes as Elon Musk’s SpaceX has ushered in a commercial space age, where private companies are making aggressive forays into the space industry, once dominated by government agencies across the globe.KAI, the South Korean defense contractor and the country’s sole aircraft maker, has already forged partnerships with Airbus in various areas, including aircraft component production, for more than a decade.But the latest agreement marks the two companies’ first joint project in the satellite business.Under a contract signed in the early 2010s, KAI is supplying about 10 wing ribs a month to Airbus for the European company’s long-range, wide-body A350 aircraft.Airbus and KAI are also partners on the Korean Utility Helicopter (KUH) and Light Civil Helicopter/Light Armed Helicopter (LCH/LAH) programs, with the first LAH targeting to enter service for the Korean army by 2023.“KAI has been involved in the Korean government’s satellite development projects over the past three decades. Airbus values KAI’s technical know-how accumulated through such efforts,” said a Korean defense industry official.Airbus, which designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products, including satellites, has also been a key partner for other Korean companies in the aerospace industry.The European company designed and manufactured South Korea's first geostationary satellite – Geo-Kompsat – with the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), and co-developed three Earth observation satellites. Airbus also built ANASIS-II, a military communications satellite launched last year.Under the latest agreement, KAI and Airbus plan to focus on the development of low-earth-orbit satellites operating 500 km to 2,000 km above the Earth for seamless 5G telecommunications, surveillance and weather observations.Since its launch in 1999, KAI has been a fixed member of South Korea’s government-driven satellite development projects.In late October, KAI played a key role in developing the propulsion tank for the first stage of Korea’s first domestically designed and developed space rocket Nuri According to Morgan Stanley, the global aerospace market is forecast to grow to $1.1 trillion by 2040 from $378 billion in 2020.Kyung-Min Kang at Kkm1026@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999759197235107}",neutral,0.9999759197235107,0

The Airbus Zephyr HAPS Reaches New Heights – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE4L3RoZS1haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLWhhcHMtcmVhY2hlcy1uZXctaGVpZ2h0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Zephyr S completed a successful 2021 test flight campaign in the United States. The final Airbus solar-powered High Altitude Platform System (HAPS) flight touched down on September13 in Arizona, USA, ending the most ambitious and successful Zephyr flight campaign to date.

Airbus’ Zephyr S take off, photo is courtesy of the company.

The flight campaign had a clear customer focus – to demonstrate how Zephyr could be used for future operations, flying outside of restricted airspace and over airspace shared with commercial air traffic. Carrying an Optical Advanced Earth Observation system for Zephyr (OPAZ) payload, Zephyr proved its operational value to provide instant, persistent, and improved situational awareness.

Airbus’ Zephyr S HAPS in flight, photo is courtesy of the company.

The campaign consisted of six flights in total, four low level test flights and two stratospheric flights. The stratospheric flights flew for around 18 days each, totaling more than 36 days of stratospheric flight in the campaign. This adds a further 887 flight hours to the 2,435 stratospheric flight hours for Zephyr to date, marks significant progress for fixed wing HAPS and is a step towards making the stratosphere an operational reality for its customers. The “Carbon Neutral” Zephyr uses sunlight to fly and recharge its batteries, using no fuel and producing no carbon emissions.

With its ability to remain in the stratosphere for months at a time, Zephyr will bring new see, sense and connect capabilities to both commercial and military customers. Zephyr will provide the potential to revolutionize disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills. It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world’s changing environmental landscape and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world.

“Working with Airbus and the Zephyr team during the 2021 flight campaign, significant progress has been made towards demonstrating HAPS as a capability. This summer’s activities represent an important step towards operationalizing the stratosphere,” said James Gavin, Future Capability Group Head at Defence Equipment & Support, the procurement arm of the UK Ministry of Defence.

“Defence investment in cutting edge technology is key to the development of world-leading military capabilities. Zephyr is an important programme within UK Strategic Command and the recent successful flight has required many innovative technical solutions. This represents a significant milestone for Zephyr which is informing the development of new concepts and ways of enabling military operations, particularly in the context of Multi-Domain Integration,” said Major General Rob Anderton-Brown, Director Capability and MDI Change Program at Strategic Command.

“Credible and proven ultra-persistence, stratospheric agility, and payload interoperability underscore why Zephyr is the leader in its sector. It is a sustainable, solar powered, ISR and network extending solution that can provide vital future connectivity and Earth Observation to where it is needed,” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9901350140571594}",positive,0.9901350140571594,1

Airbus Defence and Space and the firm’s partners, Fraunhofer IIS, Fraunhofer FOKUS, Bundeswehr University Munich and Eurescom GmbH, recently kicked-off a project to study the delivery of standards based on 5G and beyond 5G communication services over a space-based infrastructure.

The study, which is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), will propose a comprehensive vision of how a 5G and beyond-5G space-based infrastructure can provide services for consumers and industries that deliver performance, reliability, resilience and security. The consortium will propose a non-terrestrial network (NTN) infrastructure and deployment scenarios to deliver advanced communication services in a timely and cost-efficient manner. In addition, it will focus on the preparation of a future SATCOM technology roadmap in line with the emerging 6G concepts in order for an NTN to play an even greater role in offering global connectivity.

The key objectives of the study are:

To consolidate requirements to support a variety of industries and consumers, in agreement with industry stakeholders and regulators

To define services that support these market segments over the mid (2025) and long term (beyond 2030)

To define overall system architecture and its components

To define system convergence and integration with 5G and beyond 5G terrestrial networks, considering relevant standards such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project

To elaborate roadmaps in support of the development, validation, and implementation of the proposed architecture and its components, including necessary research

To establish recommendations for financing mechanisms with valid procurement and deployment models for the realisation of the proposed infrastructure.

The study is due for completion by mid-2022 and will produce a position paper describing the main findings of the study. Particular focus will be on proposing concepts for 5G space-based infrastructure and recommendations for technology and demonstration roadmaps as well as associated deployment and procurement models.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990170001983643}",neutral,0.9990170001983643,0

Friedrichshafen, 07 October 2021 –The first ""B"" model of the next generation polar orbiting weather satellite series MetOp-SG has received its rocket pack. In a tricky, millimetre-precise crane operation at Airbus’ satellite integration centre in Friedrichshafen (Germany), the six metre high satellite structure was integrated with its propulsion system.

The propulsion system, built by Airbus in Stevenage (United Kingdom), can accommodate 760 kg of hydrazine fuel to maintain the satellite’s attitude and orbit throughout its mission and, very importantly, enable a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific at the end of the satellite's mission, in accordance with the international space debris mitigation standards. The propulsion system includes twelve thrusters of 20 Newton (N) each for nominal orbit and anti-collision manoeuvres. Finally, the tank and the 400N main engine complete the propulsion system.

The MetOp-SG programme is being implemented by the European Space Agency in collaboration with EUMETSAT. The MetOp-SG satellite fleet consists of six satellites and will secure the continuation of meteorological observations from a polar orbit in the 2024-2045 timeframe. Comprehensive data from the suite of innovative European instruments will feed into forecasting models taking observations to a new standard.

Each satellite, with a launch mass of over four tons, will be launched separately. The satellites will be placed on the MetOp sun-synchronous polar orbit, at an average altitude of 831 kilometres. The nominal operational life of each satellite is 7.5 years. After seven years, the subsequent satellite of the same series will be launched, ensuring full operational coverage over a period of 21 years with a pair of A and B type satellites always in orbit.

The first launch of a MetOp-SG satellite is currently scheduled for early 2024.

MetOp-SG will provide enhanced infrared, microwave, and radio-occultation soundings of temperature and humidity; polar atmospheric motion vectors extracted from optical imagery; novel precipitation and cloud measurements from imagers in the optical, sub-millimetre and microwave spectra; and high-resolution ocean surface wind-vector and soil moisture measurements extracted from scatterometer observations. This data will help improve numerical weather prediction - the backbone of our daily weather forecasts - at regional and global levels.

MetOp-SG comprises two series of satellites, with three units in each series. The Satellite A series carries optical instruments and atmospheric sounders, while the Satellite B series features microwave instruments. The A series satellites are being developed and built under the industrial lead of Airbus in Toulouse (France), and the design and manufacture of the B series satellites is led by the company’s Friedrichshafen site in Germany.

Airbus leads an industrial consortium comprising more than 110 companies in 16 European countries and Canada, to supply more than 160 different pieces of equipment and services for the satellites’ platforms and instruments.

Israeli aerospace firm launches cargo conversion program for Airbus A330 - FreightWaves,"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pc3JhZWxpLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1maXJtLWxhdW5jaGVzLWNhcmdvLWNvbnZlcnNpb24tcHJvZ3JhbS1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWEzMzDSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaXNyYWVsaS1hZXJvc3BhY2UtZmlybS1sYXVuY2hlcy1jYXJnby1jb252ZXJzaW9uLXByb2dyYW0tZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) announced Monday it will develop a program for converting Airbus A330-300 passenger aircraft into cargo freighters and produce 30 of them for Dublin-based Avolon, the third-largest aircraft leasing company in the world, between 2025 and 2028.

Avolon is entering the air cargo market sector for the first time, seeking to capitalize on favorable conditions. All 837 of the aircraft it owns, manages or has on order — including 54 A330-200/300s — are passenger models.

The large initial order to remodel the medium-size widebody aircraft secures limited production space for Avolon and reinforces how intense demand for all-cargo aircraft has become among express carriers and general cargo operators as the airfreight market quickly picks up altitude.

The International Air Transport Association on Monday projected air cargo revenue in 2021 would reach $175 billion, more than $50 billion better than last year’s record. Boeing and other forecasters say volumes are expected to double over the next 20 years, with average compound annual growth of about 4.7%. The boom in e-commerce is a major factor behind the need for more aircraft. Online transactions represent nearly 20% of total retail sales, according to Statista. Planes provide online retailers faster transit times from many more origin points to help meet customers’ delivery expectations.

“This agreement signals Avolon’s intention to be a leading player in that expansion,” Avolon CEO Dómhnal Slattery said in a statement.

IAI would follow Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore’s ST Engineering, in remodeling the A330 into a cargo configuration. EFW has only converted a dozen of the aircraft so far (nine -300 variants plus three -200s) because the aircraft is still relatively young. More are available at reasonable prices now because cost-cutting passenger airlines, aligning fleets to lower travel demand during the pandemic, and preferring newer planes that burn less fuel are discarding many of them.

Midway through 2021, there were 249 A330-200s and 245 A330-300s in storage, Leeham News reported.

Parcel carrier DHL is the largest customer so far, taking eight converted -300s.





EFW is increasing its conversion capacity to the point that it will be able to induct about 60 aircraft per year for conversion — about 30 each for the A330 and the new A321 narrowbody conversion programs — by 2024, up from 19 conversions it expects to carry out this year, said spokeswoman Anke Lemke. The company is setting up a new conversion line in San Antonio for the smaller A321 program that is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. It also plans to establish production facilities in China and the U.S. for the A330 reconfiguration in 2022, she said.

Nearly all of EFW’s production slots for the A330 have been booked through 2026 and the company is fully booked through mid-2024 for the A321 program, Lemke said.

As the launch customer, Avolon will help IAI develop its supplemental type certificate — the approval granted by regulators to modify an aircraft from its original design.

The A330-300 is positioned as a competitor to the Boeing 767, which currently owns the market for twin-engine, medium widebody aircraft. More than 200 of them have been converted by IAI and Boeing’s authorized partner, ST Engineering, in Singapore. It has a maximum payload of 67 tons and a range of more than 3,600 nautical miles. The converted model will have up to 27 main deck pallet positions, one more than the 767, and will improve cargo loading capacity due to a unique cargo door placement. Those characteristics will make the plane very efficient to operate, IAI said.

The -300 version is longer and well-suited to carry lighter e-commerce parcels because of its extra volume.

During a virtual media briefing in May, IATA Director General Willie Walsh talked about the growth of e-commerce and called the A330 “a very efficient aircraft with great cargo capacity” that is a good candidate for conversions.

The 767 has mostly been popular with North American operators such as Atlas Air (NASDAQ: AAWW), Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Experts say the A330 will likely go to companies that already operate Airbus aircraft. But a limited supply of used 767s for conversion and the fact that EFW is setting up a conversion line in the U.S. suggests that U.S. and Canadian cargo airlines will adopt the A330 too.

IAI is a long-established aircraft engineering and conversion house. In addition to the 767, it also remanufactures various models of the Boeing 737 narrowbody jet and the Boeing 747 jumbo jet (although none of those are being produced anymore because they burn too much fuel and are expensive to operate).





IAI also is developing the first cargo conversion for the large Boeing 777-300 aircraft, which is scheduled for delivery in 2023. In August, the company signed an agreement with Etihad Engineering, part of the Etihad Aviation Group, to establish a passenger-to-freighter conversion site for the 777-300 in Abu Dhabi that will supplement IAI’s Tel Aviv facility. The deal was made possible by the diplomatic opening between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in 2020.

IAI achieved 22% growth in net income in the first half of the year, to about $100 million, and midyear sales of $2.2 billion, the highest level of first-half profitability and sales in company history. The company is also active in the defense industry, supplying satellites, weapon systems, robotics systems, cyber technology and unmanned aerial vehicles. In commercial aviation, it is a large provider of aircraft maintenance and manufacturing, business jet conversions and aerostructure development.

Avolon is 70% owned by an indirect subsidiary of China-based Bohai Leasing Co.

Orders were even more severely hit by the pandemic crisis, but Boeing's resumption of the MAX programme has helped its order cycle to recover more strongly than its delivery cycle (and more strongly than Airbus orders). Boeing also has a higher percentage of aircraft back in service than Airbus, as a result of its higher installed base in North America (where the recovery is most progressed).

This report presents data from Airbus, Boeing and the CAPA Fleet Database on the cycles of deliveries, orders and aircraft in service for the two manufacturers. The rise in these cycles is encouraging for the world's aviation industry.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
Airbus H125 performance increase fully certified in North America - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oMTI1LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWluY3JlYXNlLWZ1bGx5LWNlcnRpZmllZC1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The recent performance increase of Airbus Helicopters’ single-engine H125 helicopter has received certification from both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the U.S. and Transport Canada (TCCA) in Canada, making it now fully certified and available to all North American customers.

This major evolution includes multiple benefits for H125 operators, including an increase of the external and internal load lifting capabilities by up to 308 lb. (140 kg) and an increase of the hover ceiling out of ground effect (OGE) at maximum take-off weight. They come from an increase of up to 10% of the aircraft’s power by making full use of the available power of the current Safran Arriel 2D engine, which is managed through a software update of Thales’ Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) featuring enhanced engine limitation laws and updated performance calculation.

“The H125 is a best-seller in the region and Airbus Helicopters continues to make the necessary product evolutions in line with the needs of the market and customers globally,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region. “The extra power and resulting payload increase offered by this major upgrade mean a significant operational advantage for the critical missions our customers perform every day, especially for firefighting and aerial work. We’re proud to have the H125 working to accomplish industry expectations in terms of performance and value.”

This increased performance will be included as a standard feature on new H125s entering production in North America as of March 2022. A retrofit solution consisting of a VEMD software upgrade is also immediately available directly from Thales via an in-shop retrofit or a standard exchange. The H125 power increase is also certified by the EASA, National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil, the Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia, as well as by several other airworthiness authorities worldwide.

With more than 1,365 helicopters in the H125 family in service in North America alone, the H125 continues to lead the intermediate single-engine helicopter market in all mission segments thanks to its high performance and multi-mission capacity. In the last 10 years, half of all the intermediate single-engine law enforcement helicopters delivered in North America have been an H125, and the H125 also accounts for nearly half of all intermediate single engine utility helicopter operations in North America.

Airbus Helicopters North America is the leading supplier of helicopters in the U.S. and Canada, with a team of 1,000 employees supporting a regional fleet of more than 3,200 helicopters flying for some 800 customers across the region.

The UK MOD's Skynet 6A MILSATCOM Satellite Production Is Initiated By Airbus – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEzL3RoZS11ay1tb2RzLXNreW5ldC02YS1taWxzYXRjb20tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taXMtaW5pdGlhdGVkLWJ5LWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK’s Minister for Defence Procurement, Jeremy Quin MP, visited Airbus in Stevenage and pushed the button to start production of the first panel skin for the UK MOD’s next generation military communications satellite (MILSATCOM), Skynet 6A.

The Defence Minister started the high precision cutting machine to profile the first aluminum panels of the near six ton, Skynet 6A satellite, which is based on Airbus’ Eurostar Neo telecommunications spacecraft and he also visited the extensive cleanroom facilities on site. Airbus was awarded the more than £500 million contract to design and build Skynet 6A in July of 2020 and the program achieved its Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in December of 2020.

Skynet 6A will extend and enhance the Skynet fleet. The contract signed with the UK involves the development, manufacture, cyber protection, assembly, integration, test and launch, of the military communications satellite, Skynet 6A. The contract also covers technology development programs, new secure telemetry, tracking and command systems, launch, on-orbit testing and ground segment updates.

Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said, “Secure military satellite communications are vital for our ability to conduct operations on a global scale. Seeing the first hardware for the next generation Skynet 6A satellite shows we are on track for launch in 2025 and ready to upgrade and enhance the UK’s global military communications network.”

Richard Franklin, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space, said, “Airbus in the UK is a world leader in the design and manufacture of military and commercial telecommunications satellites, and working hand in hand with the Defence Digital team we have overcome the challenges of Covid and are on track with the program. We also look to future export opportunities which will benefit the wider space ecosystem and are actively engaged with bringing on board a wider spread of UK SMEs to deliver this essential sovereign capability.”

The Skynet 6A satellite will use more of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum available for satellite communications and the latest digital processing to provide more capacity and greater versatility than Skynet 5 satellites. The satellite will feature electric orbit raising propulsion as well as electric station keeping systems for maximum cost effectiveness.

Complete satellite integration will occur at Airbus facilities in the UK followed by testing using National Satellite Test Facility (NSTF) at Harwell in Oxfordshire supporting the UK Space Agency initiative for sovereign UK end-to-end satellite production and support. The Skynet 5 program, provided by Airbus as a full service outsource contract, has provided the UK MOD with a suite of highly robust, reliable and secure MILSATCOM services, supporting global operations since 2003.

Airbus has been involved in all Skynet phases since 1974 and this phase builds on a strong UK commitment to space manufacturing in the UK. The program commenced by using the legacy Skynet 4 satellites and then augmenting them with a fully refurbished, ground network before launching the Skynet 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D satellites between 2007 and 2012. The Skynet 5 program has reduced or removed many of the technical and service risks for the MOD, while ensuring unrivaled, secure MILSATCOM and innovation to UK forces.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9404090046882629}",neutral,0.9404090046882629,0
Italy's New Airline Picks Airbus Over Boeing - The Motley Fool,"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzA2L2l0YWx5cy1uZXctYWlybGluZS1waWNrcy1haXJidXMtb3Zlci1ib2Vpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ITA plans to buy or lease dozens of new planes over the next few years, and they will all be Airbus jets.

Long-troubled Italian flag carrier Alitalia will shut down for good at the end of next week, after plunging into bankruptcy (again) in 2017. At that time, the Italian government will launch a new successor airline called Italia Trasporto Aereo.

ITA will start operations with 52 Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) aircraft it is taking over from Alitalia. But it plans to replace many of those planes with new jets while also doubling its fleet size by the end of 2025. Last week, ITA picked Airbus as its sole new aircraft supplier in another blow to Boeing's (BA -1.96%) turnaround effort.

ITA announces fleet plans

In recent months, airline industry experts have generally believed that Airbus had the inside track for winning ITA's business. Since the carrier plans to launch service with Airbus jets inherited from Alitalia, ordering new aircraft from Boeing would force the airline to endure a costly and potentially disruptive fleet transition.

Nevertheless, ITA continued to negotiate with Boeing, too. Some industry sources believed that Boeing might offer discounts too good to pass up in an effort to start rebuilding its market share.

Ultimately, Airbus won the competition. Last week, ITA announced a memorandum of understanding with Airbus to buy 28 aircraft -- 10 A330neos, seven A220s, and 11 jets in the A320neo family -- with deliveries beginning in early 2022. Meanwhile, Air Lease announced a lease deal with ITA for 15 A220s, 11 in the A320neo family, and five A330neos, all from its existing order book. Those deliveries will begin in the second half of 2022 and run through early 2025.

ITA also plans to lease Airbus aircraft from other sources. While the airline didn't provide full details, it appears that it will lease 25 additional planes (excluding the 31 aircraft coming from Air Lease) over the next several years, including the A350-900. That means it will eventually operate aircraft from all four of Airbus' current aircraft programs.

Airbus continues shoring up its weaker aircraft programs

Winning ITA's business is particularly good news for Airbus because it will help build the order backlogs for the A220 and A330neo families.

The Airbus A220 has won accolades for its range, low fuel burn, and comfort. Nevertheless, Airbus ended August with just 470 outstanding firm orders for the type. That isn't much considering Airbus' ambition to build as many as 14 A220s per month by 2025. Moreover, leasing companies have ordered 139 A220s, but so far they have taken delivery of a mere eight.

Winning at least 22 more orders for near-term delivery (including lease placements) will help Airbus start to ramp up A220 production, even if its goal of building 14 per month seems out of reach for now.

The A330neo program faces even greater challenges due to weak demand throughout the wide-body market. Airbus is currently building just two A330neos per month, so getting 15 orders (again including lease placements) represents a major victory, as it will help Airbus sustain production until demand recovers.

Another disappointment for Boeing

By contrast, ITA's decision to adopt an all-Airbus fleet represents another missed opportunity for Boeing. While it has received more commercial jet orders than Airbus this year, its backlog remains significantly smaller than that of its European rival.

Furthermore, just two key customers, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, have accounted for the bulk of Boeing's year-to-date orders. That's problematic because big customers like those tend to negotiate bigger discounts on aircraft purchases.

Winning ITA's business would have provided some much-needed diversification for Boeing. Now, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer probably needs to get more aggressive to ensure it wins upcoming fleet renewal competitions for two of Europe's big airline groups: Air France-KLM and International Consolidated Airlines Group.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991899132728577}",neutral,0.9991899132728577,0

Airbus sets its sights on hydrogen powering the future of aircraft - H2 View,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmgyLXZpZXcuY29tL3N0b3J5L2Etc2Vpc21pYy1zaGlmdC1mb3ItYXZpYXRpb24tYWlyYnVzLXNldHMtaXRzLXNpZ2h0cy1vbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A seismic shift for aviation: Airbus sets its sights on hydrogen powering the future of aircraft

Representing approximately 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the aviation industry is in need of a disruptive change to its ‘business as usual’ if it is to meet its net zero objectives by 2050. One energy carrier emerging as a game-changing contender in the transformation of the sector is hydrogen, and Airbus is ready to be the catalyst for change.

With a 50-year track record of innovation, technological firsts and industry milestones, the designer and manufacturer of aerospace products, services and solutions to a customer base worldwide has indeed been ‘making it fly’ since the 1960s. In 1972, Airbus’ first aircraft, and the world’s first wide-body twin-aisle commercial aircraft, the A300B, performed its maiden flight, which at the time signalled the first steps towards changing the face of modern aviation. And Airbus is once again set to transform flight.

The aerospace giant has made no secret of its zest for hydrogen, unveiling three hydrogen-based aircraft concepts in 2020 along with its ambition to bring the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to commercial service by 2035. Airbus says it’s committed to leading the decarbonisation of the aerospace sector including reducing the CO2 emissions of its aircraft, helicopters, satellites and launch vehicles, as well as its industrial environmental footprint. Internal Airbus calculations estimate that hydrogen has the potential to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions by up to 50%. As the company puts it itself, “Our approach is not only ambitious, but rather a seismic shift for our industry.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998522996902466}",positive,0.9998522996902466,1
