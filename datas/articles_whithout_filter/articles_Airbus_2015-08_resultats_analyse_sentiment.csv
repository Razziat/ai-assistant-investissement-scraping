Airbus patents plane that could fly from Paris to Tokyo in three hours - The Guardian,"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE1L2F1Zy8wNS9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50cy1oeXBlcnNvbmljLXBsYW5lLXBhcmlzLXRva3lvLXRocmVlLWhvdXJz0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTUvYXVnLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1wYXRlbnRzLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtcGxhbmUtcGFyaXMtdG9reW8tdGhyZWUtaG91cnM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has won a patent for a hypersonic passenger plane, but Concorde’s hydrogen-powered successor is unlikely to leave the drawing board any time soon.

The proposed aeroplane would cut the journey time from Paris to Tokyo from 12 to under three hours. The idea, first published in 2011, is to use three different kinds of engine power to jump above the atmosphere while still using regular runways for takeoff. It has now won approval from the US Patent Office.

The concept comes as commercial space companies such as Virgin Galactic pursue plans for low-level space flights. Airbus’s proposed plane has “gothic delta wings” that echo the elegant curves of Concorde.

But Airbus dampened any hopes of a quick return to the days of the Anglo-French supersonic jet, which was taken out of service in 2003 owing to high operating costs.

“Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property,” a spokesman said. “These patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realised technology or product.”

By climbing almost vertically, the new “ultra-rapid air vehicle’s” designers hope to avoid the supersonic boom that hampered Concorde’s deployment beyond the North Atlantic, where it flew at twice the speed of sound for more than 20 years.

The hypersonic plane would take off using a regular jet engine, before rocket boosters kick in to start a sharp ascent, sending the plane soaring above the atmosphere.

Ramjet engines, currently used in missiles, would then take the plane up to altitudes of about 18 miles (30km) as the plane cruises at speeds up to mach 4.5 (a bout 3,400 mph), or 4.5 times the speed of sound. The turbojets would reignite to enable landing.

Announcing a similar proposal in 2011, Airbus Group, then known as EADS, said it would take 30-40 years to enter service, if at all. But the patent is designed to put down a marker for technology that could be useful in other developments.

Airbus says it is working on two hypersonic projects, one with Japanese partners and another with Russian and Australian involvement, with the aim of conquering speeds up to mach 6.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999198913574219}",neutral,0.9999198913574219,0
Airbus Filed a Patent for a Plane Traveling Faster Than Sound - TIME,"Mon, 03 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vMzk4MjkwMS9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LXN1cGVyc29uaWMtamV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has won a patent for an “ultra-rapid air vehicle” that the aircraft maker says could travel over four times the speed of sound, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

The patent, which was approved last month, details a hypersonic jet twice as fast as the Concorde, a supersonic jet that had previously been in commercial service. The Concorde, which was developed partly by a company now owned by Airbus, was capable of flying at about 1,300 mph (2,100 km/h), or twice the speed of sound — a feat the new invention can beat with new turbojets and a hydrogen power system, according to the patent.

Like other lofty patents, it’s unlikely that the hypersonic jet will become a reality any time soon — at least not within the one-year term for which the patent was approved. Still, some of the ideas involved with the design could make their way to real aircraft further in the future.

Airline reveals its concerns about new Airbus lavatory/galley option - - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDgvYWlybGluZS1yZXZlYWxzLWl0cy1jb25jZXJucy1hYm91dC1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWxhdmF0b3J5Z2FsbGV5LW9wdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As airlines work to increase passenger density on existing airframes the push to reduce everything else on board is very real. For the Airbus A320 family of planes the Space-Flex v2 lavatory/galley option being developed in partnership with Zodiac is one solution to this challenge and multiple airlines are understood to be considering it.

Space-Flex v2 has certain benefits, namely it adds extra space for seats, but there are also very real challenges associated with the design, especially for full-service airlines. One potential customer has been reviewing the offering, but tells RGN, “No group other than finance was enthusiastic about it.” From a passenger comfort and employee ergonomics perspective this airline saw it as a poor fit, and also expressed safety concerns.

For passengers the main issue could prove to be lavatory size. Space-Flex v2 does offer a single American with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant lavatory, which is a positive feature for a narrowbody aircraft. But unlike Space-Flex v1 – which features a swinging partition between two lavatories to accommodate passengers with reduced mobility – Space-Flex v2’s lavatories have a fixed partition, and a wheelchair-bound passenger must transfer to a tip-up seat and then, unassisted, to the toilet seat.

The lav is a tighter fit for passengers. And the layout creates access challenges as passengers negotiate between the jumpseat to enter/leave the lav, suggests the airline that spoke to RGN on condition of anonymity. This also creates a greater risk for employees or other passengers being struck by a door as they open/close in such tight quarters. And if the flight attendants have carts out before or after a meal/drink service access to the lavatories may be blocked because of the limited floor space available.

For the airlines, despite gaining the extra seating space, there may be other drawbacks as well. Some of the cited challenges, such as only one coffee pot in the rear galley, seem a bit trivial. Other challenges press against FAA regulations, presenting scenarios which flight attendants may struggle with or reject. The carrier that spoke to RGN suggests that rubbish collection, for example, becomes significantly more difficult with the limited space. The reduced number of cart positions means no dedicated trash carts in the Space-Flex v2 layout; all collection would happen in bags.

That alone is not a deal breaker, but there is minimal space to store the bags once the trash is collected; most likely flight attendants would need to transfer the contents from bags to a trash bin or compactor. The limited space would also preclude separation of recyclable materials and could potentially cause overflow of the space, requiring full rubbish bags to be stored in overhead bins (yuck!) or in the lavatories (FAA violation), suggests the airline. The FAA tells RGN, “Airbus has not applied to the FAA for the Space-Flex interior, so we do not have any information on this interior layout and cannot comment at this time.” EASA did not respond to a request for comment.

Airbus head of aircraft interiors marketing Zuzana Hrnkova addressed the garbage challenges when she told RGN that the design was finalized with “validation from airline representatives” so that there has been some buy-in from the stakeholders. Moreover, she noted that most of the customers so far “don’t really [offer] a full service….so there is not a lot of waste generated”. That may work for some LCCs but for the full-service carriers other options such as an integrated trash compactor (still in development) would be used to help offset the loss of space. If still more space is needed, additional galley monuments can be installed, though that reduces the number of additional seats the airline will be able to fit in the plane.

Other safety concerns raised by the airline include the double-deep ovens and increased burn risk when accessing the rear rack and a more constrained workspace, increasing risk of strains and sprains. Similarly, some of the cart positions become three-deep rather than the current two-deep maximum. The logistics of moving the carts around in the galley space – and, particularly, storing the full cart behind the half cart during turbulence – presents a challenge which could further expose flight attendants to greater risks. With such injuries costing the airline $25,000+ per incident on average these risks cannot be overlooked, says the airline.

Specifically addressing the service preparation and galley cart issue, Airbus’ Hrnkova suggested that minor adjustments to airline operational procedures could solve many of the issues. “After the take-off cabin crew can start preparing the service [while the seat belt sign is illuminated]. Cabin crew can start their service before the passengers are allowed to move in the cabin,” she said.

When talking about the potential for spatial issues related to lavatory access and jumpseats, Hrnkova noted,

“The seat is used for takeoff and landing. It is not used during the flight phase. On the type of sectors which the A320 operates the cabin crew are busy with the service, with onboard sales and afterwards preparing the aircraft for landing. So the seat is not used during the flight phase.”

This is true for shorter flights, however a number of airlines use A319s and A320s on longer stage lengths. The North America market, in particular, sees Air Canada, American, United, JetBlue and Virgin America all operating A320s with an average block time of greater than 140 minutes, according to flight data based on OAG schedules for 3 August 2015.

Longer stage lengths also generally mean more “stuff” in the galley, whether snacks, drinks or garbage collection. Airbus’ Hrnkova spoke to this topic, noting that there is an add-on option for the Space-Flex v2 layout which can meet those airlines’ needs. “What we believe is going to happen is that version 2, with increased half-size trolley capacity, will mainly be selected by low-cost operators. However, for full-service carriers, if they have more catering requirements, there is still possibility to integrate on the right hand side the three-trolley galley and compensate the galley capacity. In any case there is a gain of three seats which is very good and the capability to offer full service to passengers.”

The loss of roughly a third of the storage space on the A320 already means cuts must happen somewhere. Compounding those cuts with design options which could increase risks to the crew presents a conflict. Thus far the Space-Flex product is seeing adoption in the LCC markets. Vueling has deployed v1 of the offering (the Airbus-own option) and JetBlue is expected to use the newer v2 (Airbus/Zodiac option) as part of the company’s retrofit of its A320 fleet, adding 15 seats.

Can the Space-Flex v2 design work on board, even for a full-service carrier? Absolutely. But compromises must be made to get to a workable solution. And, based on the design validation and planning from Airbus it seems clear that there are very different use cases, some of which will be more successful than others.

Airbus explains Space-Flex v1 in the video below; as mentioned, there are material differences between v1 and v2.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5928540825843811}",neutral,0.5928540825843811,0

Airbus has finalized the aerospace company's biggest order after it inked a $26.5 billion deal with India's popular budget airline, IndiGo. India's largest domestic airline, IndiGo has ordered 250 A320neo family aircraft, a deal which is worth around $26.5 billion at list prices, the European aviation giant confirmed Monday. The A320neo aircraft is a more fuel efficient version of Airbus' A320, which will help IndiGo deliver more low-cost fares and enable the company further opportunity to create a greater amount of jobs and growth, Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo confirmed with CNBC over the phone Monday. Kiran Rao, head of strategy and marketing at Airbus, told CNBC Monday what the company was ""very excited now that they've (IndiGo) ordered 250 aircraft, making it the largest deal in the history of Airbus."" ""With India being one of the fastest airline markets in the world, Airbus is extremely proud of this particular deal.""



Credit: Airbus S.A.S.

Within 20 years, the International Air Transport Association expects to see India's air travel market increase dramatically from today's levels, predicting it to become the third largest global market by 2031.

In terms of Airbus' future growth strategy, Rao said India was a key component to the business' future. ""India is probably the fourth-largest aircraft ordering market in the world over the next 20 years. When we first started India back in the 1990s, we were forecasting that India would have about 300 airplanes over 20 years. Today, the forecast in India is nearly 1,700 airplanes for the next 20 years."" ""So it's a very big market and the success that Airbus has had in India over the last few years, puts us at 80 percent market share in one of the most important markets in the world today.""

Rao went on to add that he was confident that low-cost emerging market airlines were going to dominate global air trade by 2025; especially with carriers such as IndiGo giving people an opportunity to travel more. IndiGo has had a long history with the aircraft manufacturer. In 2005, the Indian airline placed an order for 100 A320s, and six years later, the company became the first Indian operator to pledge an order to Airbus' A320neo, in 2011. Now IndiGo has ordered a total of 530 A320 Family aircraft, according to Airbus' website. IndiGo's Ghosh told CNBC that he was ""very happy"" with the latest deal, and its relationship with Airbus will create even more stability and hopefully profitability for their business model.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9981600642204285}",positive,0.9981600642204285,1

Developing wings that are lighter and more efficient is a major focus for aircraft manufacturers these days, essentially because it'll help carriers make bank. Airbus just started production on wings for its new Airbus A350-1000.

From Airbus:

At 32 metres long by six metres wide, the A350 XWB wing is the largest single part made from carbon fibre composite material in use in civil aviation today. They are designed and developed at Airbus’ facility in Filton, near Bristol, where a number of other systems are designed and tested including fuel systems and landing gear.



To improve efficiency at higher speeds, the A350 XWB can deflect its wing flaps differentially, optimising the wing profile and providing better load control.

According to Airbus, these are the largest single parts made from carbon composite material in civil aviation history. Meanwhile, Forbes reports United Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines are just a few carriers who've already ordered the new aircraft, and are hoping to capitalize on its aerodynamic prowess.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.944993257522583}",positive,0.944993257522583,1

The deal comes at a time when India's air passenger market is seeing rapid expansion, boosted by a growing economy and fast-expanding middle class.

Fuel efficiency matters

Smaller passenger planes are increasingly in demand around Asia as budget carriers expand their reach to less prominent cities.

Airbus says the A320neo is also designed to be fuel-efficient, consuming 15 percent less fuel - a significant selling point for airlines in the cut-throat medium-haul sector.

In other words, Airbus just patented a hypersonic jet.

Airbus expects the jet to reach speeds as high as Mach 4.5 — or 4 1/2 times the speed of sound.

According to PatentYogi's Deepak Gupta, this means the Airbus jet could make the trip from London to New York in just one hour. That's a significant improvement over the 3 1/2 hours it took for the now retired Mach 2 Concorde to make the same trip. The Concorde was a joint venture between Airbus' two predecessors, France's Aerospatiale and British Aerospace.

The hypersonic jet would also demolish the seven to eight hours it takes a conventional airliner, such as Airbus' own A330, to cross the Atlantic.

In addition, Airbus thinks the patented craft would be able to complete trips like Paris to San Francisco or Tokyo to Los Angeles in just three hours.

In the patent, Airbus describes the craft as ""an air vehicle including a fuselage, a gothic delta wing distributed on either side of the fuselage, and a system of motors able to propel the air vehicle.""

The jet is powered by three different types of engines that work in sequential order to get the craft aloft, into cruising altitude, and then up to its cruising speed of more than 3,000 mph.

To get off the ground, the craft will use two turbojets mounted under the fuselage as well as a rocket motor mounted in the rear. As the Airbus lifts off the runway, it will climb vertically like the Space Shuttle. Right before the jet reaches the speed of sound, the turbojets shut down and retract into the belly of plane — leaving only the rocket motor to guide it up to an altitude of more than 100,000 feet.

At cruising altitude, the rocket motor will shut down and retract into the fuselage. Then the plane's pair of wing-mounted ramjets take over and propel the aircraft to a top speed of Mach 4.5.

Airbus suggests it will be powered by various forms of hydrogen stored aboard the craft.

According to Airbus, much of the plane's aerodynamics are designed to limit and reduce the sonic boom it will create when it reaches supersonic speed. In the 1970s, the Concorde was beset by complaints of sonic booms and noise pollution created by its four Rolls-Royce Olympus turbojet engines. Consequently, it was prevented from operating over land.

As a result, the supersonic Anglo-French airliner was never able to become the financially viable mainstream passenger transport its creators had hoped for. Instead, the 14 production Concordes spent their 27-year career shuttling well-heeled VIPs across the Atlantic.

Airbus believes the hypersonic jet could have both civilian and military applications. In civilian trim, the craft could serve as private jet or as an airliner with room for 20 passengers. In military trim, the jet could serve as a hypersonic transport for commandos or as a reconnaissance plane like the SR71 Blackbird.

In addition, Airbus has also proposed a variant armed with high-power electromagnetic pulse weapons to conduct precision strikes on high-value targets.

As with most patented ideas, it's unlikely the jet will ever enter production. But technology derived from the hypersonic plane could make its way into Airbus' other less extreme products.

"Singapore Airlines pushes Boeing, Airbus for 18-hour flights - Runway Girl Network","Sun, 30 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDgvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLXB1c2hlcy1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWZvci0xOC1ob3VyLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Will an airline ever again fly nonstop between the US and southeast Asia? Singapore Airlines would certainly like to bring back the all-business flights it decided to cut in 2013, from its Changi hub to Newark and Los Angeles. The carrier has this summer been pushing Boeing and Airbus to offer long-range premium cabin configurations of the 787 and A350, and earlier this month Airbus’ Kiran Rao spoke to Bloomberg about Airbus’ work to do so.

It’s all about making the most of new-generation composite twinjets, which are a significant step forward from the four-engined Airbus A340-500 aircraft designed and built during a previous (and now superseded) ETOPS paradigm, which Singapore Airlines used to use for its ultra-longhaul all-business nonstops (pictured above).

With Boeing recently adjusting the advertised example ranges of its own composite twinjet 787 family downwards — the 787-9 stretch officially dropped to 7,635nm from 8,300nm, in comparison with the Newark-Singapore polar Great Circle route at 8285nm — and the A350-900’s example three-class range of 7,600nm, the two aircraft would appear roughly neck-and-neck. Will the compact size of the 787 or the bigger fuel tanks of the A350 make the economic difference?

Singapore Airlines’ successor flights to the nonstops, using the Airbus A380 to New York and LA with upper deck business class cabins that feel very similar to the A350, have to stop — the former in Frankfurt and the latter in Narita — which can feel disjointed, particularly on the eastbound redeye leg from New York. The sub-eight hour flight (especially with tailwinds in winter) and 9pm departure can mean night owls only have a couple of hours’ opportunity for a nap after dinner before arriving in Germany the next morning.

I flew on the world’s longest ever commercial nonstop flight, SQ21, aboard SQ’s all-business 100-seater A340-500, shortly before it was cut, and the odd thing about the experience was that the nineteen-hour nonstop wasn’t all that markedly different, #paxex–wise, from the fifteen-hour flight returning from Taipei to New York later that week.

Dinner on departure from Newark was the usual impressive Singapore Airlines fare. How the carrier manages to get even halfway decent food out of a New York area airport is beyond me, not least because the month before I had flown to Helsinki in Finnair business from JFK and experienced a meal I called the Prawns of Misery and the Asparagus of Despair; upon showing a photo of the meal to Finnair’s service team, the response was sighs, shaken heads and an unprintable selection of epithets about outstation US catering operations.

Second dinner — after a seriously good and much-needed eight-hour sleep and a generous helping of Bollinger Champagne — was a selection of perfect noodle soups or rice dishes, ideal to slurp at while enjoying a film.

And it’s that second dinner-and-a-movie phase that was the uniqueness of the flight for me. Over the polar regions, half-watching a film and then spotting a glorious sunset and switching to music while staring out the window, it was that twilight period between first sleep and second sleep, with no noise but the quiet thrum of the A340-500’s Rolls-Royce engines that brought the passenger experience magic.

Of course, many of my fellow passengers on that flight slept through the night, and that’s the beauty of an ultra-longhaul nonstop compared with two shorter connecting flights: sleep is up to the passenger, their body, and the schedule they want to maintain on arrival. It’s the absence of the discombobulation often experienced by passengers blearily transiting a network carrier megahub in the middle of the night, and the need to pack up, disembark, walk around the terminal for a bit, and then reboard and unpack again.

NYC-Singapore used to be the longest flight in the world, with that record currently held by Qantas’ DFW-Sydney Airbus A380 flights and soon to be supplanted by Emirates’ Dubai-Panama City Boeing 777-200LR service. Can Singapore Airlines regain that title with a newer aircraft?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

The Bell-Fuji helicopters will be delivered over a 20-year period from 2021.

There was industry-wide surprise in July when the defence ministry awarded a contract to a consortium of Bell Helicopter of the US and Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries to supply 150 military helicopters to the self-defence forces.

Airbus is eyeing legal action against Japan's ministry of defence after losing out on a multibillion-dollar deal to supply helicopters to the country's ground self-defence forces, said people familiar with the situation.

Airbus teamed up with Kawasaki Heavy Industries to bid for the contract, known as the UH-X program.

Legal action by Airbus against Japan's defence ministry over the tender process is described by western diplomats and industry insiders as ""one of several possible avenues of complaint"" being considered by the European aerospace group. The Airbus-Kawasaki bid, which proposed a new version of the Airbus H160 helicopter, was seen as the strong favourite until just a few weeks before the defence ministry's decision was unveiled.

Bell-Fuji offered a cheaper, modestly modified version of the Bell 412EPI — a derivative of a helicopter that has been in use since before the Vietnam war.

Airbus declined to comment on the possibility of taking legal action against the Japanese defence ministry.

However, some of its senior executives have alleged privately that the Japanese selection process was not transparent, may have come under political pressure and failed to give appropriate weighting to the future export potential of its proposed design, said people familiar with the situation.

It remains unclear whether Kawasaki plans to join Airbus in any complaint against the Japanese defence ministry and the company had no immediate comment.

Richard Thornley, managing director for Bell Helicopter in Japan, said the Bell-Fuji proposal would deliver a cost-effective, capable and reliable replacement for the ground self-defence forces' current fleet of ageing Bell-Fuji UH-1J aircraft.

""The Fuji-Bell team offered the best value proposition for Japan based on the proven Bell 412EPI design, and the best opportunity to further Japan's economic and industrial advancement with the lowest amount of risk to cost and delivery schedule,"" he added.

A spokesman for the Japanese defence ministry declined to comment on any potential legal action by Airbus but said the selection process had been appropriate, fair and fully transparent.

One industry veteran familiar with Airbus said the company may have lost the helicopter contract after lobbying by the US government on Bell Helicopter's behalf. ""When there is a US bidder involved there is always the feeling that pressure may have come directly from the US,"" he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9706485867500305}",neutral,0.9706485867500305,0

Airbus patents design for Mach 4-plus supersonic jet - New Atlas,"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1wYXRlbnQtbWFjaC00LXN1cGVyc29uaWMtamV0LzM4NzgyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If there's one area where the 21st century has gone backwards technologically, it's in supersonic passenger flight. With the grounding of the Concorde fleets in 2003, flying faster than the speed of sound reverted to a military monopoly, but that hasn't kept engineers from trying for a revival. Now Airbus' Marco Prampolini and Yohann Coraboeuf have been granted a US patent for an ""ultra-rapid air vehicle"" designed to fly at 20 km (12.4 mi) higher than conventional aircraft and over four times the speed of sound – twice the speed of Concorde.

Even in its heyday, civilian supersonic flight held on by the skin of its teeth. Concorde may have carried the wealthy and glamorous across the Atlantic in under three hours, but only 20 were ever built after an Anglo-French development program in the 1960s that was compared to the Apollo Moon landings in cost and complexity.

A combination of sonic booms, restrictive US FAA regulations, and the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s made the Concorde economically unviable and it ended up as a tiny fleet, only flying with British Airways and Air France because of French and British government pressure. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union's Tupolev TU-144 ""Concordski"" had an extremely short career after a fatal crash at the Paris Air Show in 1973.

The Airbus patent takes the idea of the Concorde, boosts the performance and reduces the impact of the infamous sonic boom. According to Airbus, the craft is essentially a flying tanker with most of the fuselage made up of liquid oxygen and ecofriendly liquid hydrogen. Forward of this is a passenger cabin for 24 people, with the cockpit in the bow.

Cutaway of the Airbus supersonic aircraft

It's also a very odd looking airplane with a gothic delta wing that gives it a strangely truncated look, as if it had been whittled down to fit into an unusually narrow hangar. The gothic delta is similar to a conventional delta wing with a 70 to 75-degree sweep, except that the leading edges of the wings are curved into the shape of a gothic window frame. Behind these, set on cylinders, are trapezoidal fins on the trailing edge of each wing. These not only take on the tasks of a conventional tail's rudder and elevators, but also alter the center of pressure as the fuel and oxygen are burned to keep the aircraft properly trimmed.

But what really sets the Airbus dsign apart is its suite of propulsion systems used to keep it aloft. On a typical flight, it would take off like a conventional plane using ordinary turbojet engines, but once in the air, an open door in the stern of the plane reveals a rocket motor. When this fires, it sends the aircraft into a near vertical trajectory, accelerating it to supersonic speeds.

The Airbus supersonic aircraft uses three propulsion systems

As the airplane approaches Mach one, the turbojets shut down and retract into the fuselage. On completion of the acceleration phase the plane is now flying at anywhere from Mach 4 to Mach 4.5 at an altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 m (100,000 to 150,000 ft). The rocket motor shuts down and is again concealed as the aft door slides shut to reduce drag. A ramjet now kicks in and the aircraft cruises along its flight path and can cover a range of 9,000 km (5,600 mi) in three hours – the equivalent of Tokyo to Los Angeles or Paris to San Francisco. Meanwhile, the wing fuselage design dissipates the sonic shock wave over 110 to 175 km (68 to 109 mi) and angles it at 11 to 15 degrees so it doesn't reach the ground. At the end of the journey, split flaps reduce speed and the turbojets take over for approach and landing.

Airbus says that the supersonic passenger craft can operate from conventional airports so long as they can supply the cryogenic propellants. It wouldn't interfere with existing air corridors, would operate in all weather, and only the rocket motor requires special maintenance. According to its specifications, it could carry two or three tons of cargo, which is equivalent to 24 passengers and luggage.

It's highly unlikely that the Airbus supersonic will ever be built, but if it is, a ticket won't be cheap. The company sees it as catering to VIP passengers who need to make round-trip transcontinental trips in a single day. Alternatively, the craft could also have military applications as a fast strike craft invulnerable to conventional anti-aircraft weapons and interceptors, yet capable of operating over long distances to employ EMP weapons against high-value targets.

In the past, Airbus received noise complaints about the Concorde, their previous version of a hypersonic luxury jet, which was in service from 1976 to 2003. That jet, which was about half as fast as the new version, was taken out of service in 2003 because of high operating costs and low revenue, especially after a crash in 2000 scared away passengers. The new version would lift off vertically like a space shuttle, so that the sonic boom—which is produced when the sound barrier is broken—would dissipate in the air without bothering people on the ground.

Unfortunately, Airbus has released a statement that crushes hopes of hypersonic hammock travel anytime soon. They wrote, “Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property, these patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realised technology or product.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999850988388062}",neutral,0.9999850988388062,0

Airbus predicted the proposed craft will also be able to complete trips like Paris to San Francisco or Tokyo to Los Angeles in just three hours.

Airbus Helicopters Photo

Safety concerns have prompted Airbus Helicopters to introduce a new functional check procedure for the yaw load compensator in all AS350 B3 and AS550 C3 helicopter models.

Safety Information Notice No. 2944-S-29, issued Aug. 26, 2015, describes the new procedure, which moves the yaw load compensator check from the run-up phase of flight to after rotor shutdown. According to Airbus Helicopters, the new procedure improves the sensitivity of the check for all AS350 operators, and, for aircraft equipped with a dual hydraulic system, helps prevent pilots from inadvertently taking off without tail rotor hydraulic assistance. The procedure has already been adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency as an Airworthiness Directive (AD) with an effective date of Aug. 31, 2015.

The safety notice and AD come less than a month after lawsuits were filed against Airbus Helicopters and Air Methods by flight nurses David Repsher and Matthew Bowe, survivors of the July 3 Flight For Life helicopter crash in Frisco, Colo., that killed pilot Patrick Mahany. The accident is still under investigation by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, who have not yet indicated the cause of the accident. In their complaints, however, Repsher and Bowe allege that the AS350 B3e (now called H125) helicopter crashed after taking off without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor.

It would not be the first instance of an AS350 pilot taking off without tail rotor hydraulic assistance. In August 2014, Airbus Helicopters issued Safety Information Notice No. 2776-S-29 for dual-hydraulic AS350 and AS355 helicopters after receiving reports of pilots taking off with their collective-mounted yaw servo isolation switches in the “OFF” (aft) position. In these instances, the pilots likely forgot to restore the switch to “ON” during their pre-takeoff hydraulic checks, after pressing the “ACCU TST” push button on the console to drain trapped hydraulic pressure from the yaw load compensator. (In AS350 B1 and higher models, the yaw load compensator provides the assistance required for an average pilot to control the aircraft in the event of a hydraulic system failure.)

After the yaw load compensator has been drained, hydraulic assistance is not restored to the tail rotor until the collective-mounted switch is returned to the “ON” position. However, unless dual-hydraulic aircraft have been equipped with a specific modification (07.4622), there is no illumination on the caution and warning panel to remind pilots when the switch is “OFF”. Moreover, on dual-hydraulic models, loads on the cyclic and collective remain normal throughout the checks, also providing no reminder to the pilot when the yaw servo is isolated from hydraulic pressure. (For a fuller explanation of the system and associated checks, click here .)

As Airbus Helicopters’ latest safety notice warns, pilots who take off without tail rotor hydraulic assistance “may incorrectly perceive this condition as a tail rotor control failure (jamming), which could lead to a loss of control of the helicopter, if the lack of hydraulic assistance is not quickly identified and corrected.”

Pressing the “ACCU TST” button on the console releases trapped hydraulic fluid from the yaw load compensator. In Airbus Helicopters’ new procedure, this step is done after rotor shutdown. In this photo, the guarded collective-mounted yaw servo isolation switch is in the “OFF” (aft) position. Elan Head Photo

Under the new functional check procedure, trapped hydraulic fluid is not released from the yaw load compensator during the run-up phase, thus reducing the likelihood that pilots will take off with their yaw load compensators isolated and drained. Instead, after rotor shutdown, the pilot first checks that the right pedal moves forward without any pilot action or with reduced load on the pedal. Although the safety notice does not elaborate on this step, pedal movement indicates that hydraulic fluid remains trapped in the yaw load compensator (while movement to the right assumes that the pedals are biased slightly right of the zero-thrust position at rotor shutdown).

The pilot then presses the “ACCU TST” push button, draining the trapped hydraulic fluid, and verifies that the pedals can be centered again and that they remain centered. If the result of the check is not satisfactory, then yaw load compensator maintenance work must be carried out.

The new procedure is being introduced in the form of flight manual revisions via Service Bulletins No. 67.00.66 (for the AS350 B3) or 67.00.40 (for the AS550 C3). In its safety notice, Airbus Helicopters urges operators “to integrate the applicable pages into your flight manuals for these aircraft, and to explicitly inform all of your pilots of the changes to the flight manuals directly, in order to ensure that they comply with this new procedure immediately and systematically.”

A similar analysis for AS355/AS555 helicopters equipped with Arrius engines is currently underway, according to Airbus Helicopters. The manufacturer’s safety notice also reminds operators of the availability of modification 07.4622 for dual-hydraulic helicopters, which incorporates dedicated amber “HYDR” caution lights for each hydraulic circuit, and a flashing mode on the “HYDR 2” light when the collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic isolation switch is in the “OFF” position.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997250437736511}",neutral,0.9997250437736511,0

Lawsuits renew attention on operation of dual-hydraulic AS350 helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbGF3c3VpdHNyZW5ld2F0dGVudGlvbm9ub3BlcmF0aW9ub2ZkdWFsaHlkcmF1bGljYXMzNTBoZWxpY29wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Many dual-hydraulic AS350 series helicopters still lack a modification intended to help prevent pilots from taking off without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor. Airbus Helicopters Photo

One year ago, Airbus Helicopters issued a safety notice to operators of dual-hydraulic AS350/AS355 series helicopters warning of the potential for pilots to inadvertently take off without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor.

Now, the problem described in the safety notice is central to lawsuits filed on behalf of flight nurses David Repsher and Matthew Bowe, survivors of last month’s fatal Flight For Life helicopter crash in Frisco, Colo.

Repsher and Bowe were seriously injured — and pilot Patrick Mahany was killed — in the July 3 crash of the Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3e (now called H125) operated by Air Methods Corp. According to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the aircraft began rotating counterclockwise immediately after takeoff from the Summit Medical Center helipad before descending into a nearby parking lot. A post-impact fire destroyed the aircraft and severely burned Repsher, who was on fire as he extricated himself from the helicopter.

The NTSB’s preliminary report gives no indication as to the cause of the accident, and its final investigation report is not expected for many months. However, complaints filed on July 31 by attorneys for Repsher and Bowe claim, among other things, that Airbus Helicopters was negligent in its design of the AS350 tail rotor system, and that Air Methods was negligent for failing to adopt a design change recommended by Airbus for dual-hydraulic AS350 helicopters.

“Defendant Air Methods breached its duty of care and was negligent for failure to follow safety-critical warnings, instructions, and directions from Airbus relating to proper and safe operation of the helicopter, resulting in takeoff of the subject helicopter without hydraulic assistance to the tail rotor,” the complaints state.

The Problem





Airbus Helicopters issued Safety Information Notice No. 2776-S-29 last August after receiving reports of pilots taking off with their collective-mounted yaw servo isolation switches in the “OFF” position, likely because they omitted a step in their pre-takeoff hydraulic checks. In AS350 and AS355 series helicopters, this can result in significantly increased pedal loads that may be incorrectly perceived by the pilot as a tail rotor failure.

According to a spokesperson for the manufacturer’s U.S. subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters Inc., Airbus has received formal reports of two such events that did not result in injuries: one confirmed case involving an AS350 in the U.S., and one possible case involving an AS355 outside the U.S. “Please be aware Airbus Helicopters cannot confirm or comment on any potentially responsive information received in pending Accident Investigation Board investigations,” the spokesperson noted.

Safety Information Notice No. 2776-S-29 described a modification designed to address the problem, 07.4622, which incorporates dedicated amber “HYDR” caution lights for each hydraulic circuit. It also integrates a flashing mode on the “HYDR 2” light when the collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic isolation switch is in the “OFF” position — providing pilots with a prominent visual reminder to restore the switch to “ON” before flight.

The modification has been incorporated on new-production AS350 B3e (now called H125) helicopters for the past year, and is available as a kit for retrofit on older aircraft via service bulletin. Yet relatively few operators have installed it. According to Airbus Helicopters Inc., as of July 28, U.S. customers had ordered 54 kits for modification 07.4622. With 204 aircraft in the U.S. fleet eligible for the modification, that means at least 150 aircraft have not been retrofitted (information for the global fleet was not immediately available).

The expense of the modification is borne by the operator. According to Airbus Helicopters Inc., the cost of the kit for modification 07.4622 is approximately US$2,250, and the list price for a new caution and warning panel (CWP) to accommodate the modification is $4,597.74. Discounts are possible for larger orders.

Vertical, the difficulty in controlling yaw without hydraulic assistance on AS350 helicopters is related to the high zero pitch return moment of the increasingly large aft tail rotor blade surface area on B1 and higher models. On these aircraft, a yaw load compensator is installed in parallel with the tail rotor servo, providing the load assistance required for an average pilot to control the aircraft in the event of a hydraulic system failure. As previously reported in, the difficulty in controlling yaw without hydraulic assistance on AS350 helicopters is related to the high zero pitch return moment of the increasingly large aft tail rotor blade surface area on B1 and higher models. On these aircraft, a yaw load compensator is installed in parallel with the tail rotor servo, providing the load assistance required for an average pilot to control the aircraft in the event of a hydraulic system failure.

Loads on pedals remain manageable. 2: The ACCU TST button is depressed (light on button illuminates). Loads on pedals are high. 3: The ACCU TEST button is released (light on button extinguishes). Pilot should turn yaw servo isolation switch to the “ON” (forward) position and confirm no loads are felt on pedals. Elan Head Photos

If an actual loss of hydraulic pressure occurs, a check valve in the system closes, trapping the necessary hydraulic pressure within the yaw load compensator. On dual-hydraulic AS350 and AS355 models, this is simulated during pre-takeoff checks by turning the collective-mounted yaw servo isolation switch to the “OFF” position. This cuts off the flow of hydraulic fluid to the tail rotor circuit, allowing the pilot to confirm that the check valve is functioning properly and that the yaw load compensator keeps pedal loads manageable. (During these checks, because of the dual hydraulics, all main rotor servos will continue to receive hydraulic assistance.)

The pilot then presses the “ACCU TEST” button “ON”, which releases trapped hydraulic pressure through a solenoid valve. The pilot verifies correct operation of the solenoid valve by confirming that the pedals go to a zero-thrust position, and that significantly more force is required to move them from that position. When the “ACCU TEST” button is depressed, a light on the button illuminates to alert the pilot to its position.

Releasing the “ACCU TEST” button extinguishes the light on the button and closes the yaw load compensator solenoid valve. However, the system remains unpressurized until the collective-mounted hydraulic isolation switch is returned to the “ON” position, restoring the flow of hydraulic fluid to the tail rotor circuit. The pilot should then confirm restoration of full hydraulic assistance by verifying that no loads are felt on the pedals.

If the pilot inadvertently skips this step — whether due to haste, a lack of understanding of the system, or both — there is no illumination on the CWP to remind him or her of the omission unless the aircraft has been equipped with mod 07.4622. Meanwhile, loads on the cyclic and collective will remain normal — also providing no reminder to the pilot that the yaw servo isolation switch remains “OFF”.

Ongoing Investigations

The complaints filed in the Flight For Life crash contend that “Air Methods breached its duty of care and was negligent for failure to follow and adopt the recommended design change by Airbus for the dual hydraulics tail rotor system that would create a caution light on the caution/warning panel (CWP) in the event that the hydraulic activation switch was not engaged prior to takeoff.”

They further claim that Airbus Helicopters “designed, manufactured, and supplied an unsafe and unreasonably dangerous tail rotor system which is uncontrollable in the event of a failure” and that Airbus “failed to retrofit, recall, or otherwise modify the dual hydraulic circuitry so as to adequately warn pilots with either caution lights on the caution/warning panel (CWP) or auditory warning whenever the yaw servo hydraulic switch is not timely or properly activated prior to takeoff of the helicopter.”

The complaints accuse Airbus Helicopters of failing to provide “adequate instruction and warnings to operators and pilots” regarding operation of the tail rotor hydraulics system, and the differences that exist for pre-flight hydraulic checks between dual and single hydraulic aircraft. However, the complaints do not specifically question the adequacy of Air Methods’ own training for its pilots.

Peter Rietz, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to answer questions from Vertical. Air Methods also refrained from comment on the case, citing the ongoing investigation by the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration, and respect for “the legal process.”

Because of litigation surrounding the Flight For Life case, Air Methods also declined to comment on a similar incident involving an AS350 B3 in Hamilton, Texas, last June. Air Methods confirmed that there had been a hard landing with no injuries, but did not answer specific questions regarding the cause of the incident or how it had been addressed through the company’s safety management system. Since August 2014, when Vertical originally contacted Air Methods on the subject, the company has also refused to say how it responded to Safety Information Notice No. 2776-S-29.

PHI Air Medical, another operator that has experienced a recent accident involving an AS350, likewise declined to comment for this story due to the ongoing investigation into the accident.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6652331948280334}",neutral,0.6652331948280334,0
Airbus helicopter featured on new postal stamp - USA TODAY,"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDgvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWNvYXN0LWd1YXJkLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItc3RhbXAvMzExNzAzNTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus helicopter featured on new postal stamp

The U.S. Postal Service released a stamp Tuesday featuring an image of the Airbus MH-65 Dolphin — the bright orange helicopter with the circular fan on the tail that has been used by the U.S. Coast Guard for 30 years and is familiar to civilians and avgeeks from movies and news footage about water rescues.

According to the U.S. Postal Service, the stamp was issued on the 100th anniversary of the day President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the 1915 “Act to Create the Coast Guard.” The agency traces its origins back to 1790, when President George Washington signed an act that called for a fleet of ten boats to help with “the collection of duties ... imported into the United States.”

The United States Coast Guard stamp is issued as a Forever stamp (so it will always be good for mailing a one-ounce piece of First Class mail) and, in addition to the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter, features an image of the cutter Eagle, a three-masted sailing ship known as “America’s Tall Ship.”

The image for the stamp is from an oil painting by aviation artist William S. Phillips.

Airbus shared this “by the numbers” list of factoids about the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter:

1980 - maiden Coast Guard flight

1985 - introduced into Coast Guard inventory

102 - aircraft in inventory

1,413,092 - USCG flight hours

853 - horse power of each engine

10 - number of blades in Fenestron tail

201 - maximum speed in mph

409 - range in miles

4 - crew members

Airbus files patent for supersonic jet that could fly from San Francisco to Paris in three hours - USA TODAY,"Tue, 04 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTUvMDgvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWZpbGVzLXBhdGVudC1mb3Itc3VwZXJzb25pYy1qZXQtdGhhdC1jb3VsZC1mbHktZnJvbS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXRvLXBhcmlzLWluLXRocmVlLWhvdXJzLzgzMDcxNTQ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus files patent for supersonic jet that could fly from San Francisco to Paris in three hours

Airbus has filed a patent for a supersonic aircraft that flies twice as fast as the Concorde and could get you from Tokyo to Los Angeles or San Francisco to Paris in a ridiculous three hours, or roughly the time that it currently takes to fly from San Francisco to Dallas. The unnamed ""ultra rapid air vehicle"" would flat-out blow your eyebrows back, as it could reach speeds that range from Mach 4 to Mach 4.5 – more than four times the speed of sound – a speedometer reading that makes the Concorde seem sluggish by comparison.

The jet would have three different kinds of engines, each that would be active during different parts of the flight. As explained by Deepak Gupta, the Patent Yogi, the two turbojets would propel the aircraft during taxiing and takeoff and then would retract into the fuselage before the rocket engine (yes, this plane has a rocket engine) would propel it in a ""near vertical"" flight path. After the plane reached an altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 meters (98,425 to 114,829 feet), the rocket engine would also retract into the fuselage and it would be propelled horizontally by the two wing-mounted ramjets.

According to the patent application, the designers see the jet being used for both civil or military applications. ""In the case of civil applications, the market envisaged is principally that of business travelers and VIP passengers who require transcontinental journeys within one day,"" the designers wrote. And that's patent-speak for ""There's no way you could afford one of the 20 seats on this jet, so don't get your hopes up.""

If it were to enter service as a military plane, the designers envision it being used to conduct surveillance missions, to transport ""high added-value goods"" or to carry out precision missile strikes. Although there's a reasonably good chance this plane won't be developed beyond these drawings, it has been designed to reduce the sonic boom and environmental impact that prevented the Concorde from ever operating over land. ""This noise,"" the patent application says ""has been the main limit preventing the opening of lines other than transatlantic ones for the Concorde aircraft."" Because this futuristic jet would be launched vertically like a space shuttle, the sound energy generated would travel parallel to the earth, preventing the molar-rattling bang that other craft produce when they break the sound barrier.

And now that three-hour flight to Dallas seems way less impressive.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999864935874939}",neutral,0.999864935874939,0

Allegiant Travel Company, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, is continuing to grow its Airbus fleet with a firm order for one A320 aircraft. This marks the airline’s 50th commitment to an Airbus A320 Family member, and the first time they have purchased an aircraft directly from Airbus. Airbus’ Asset Management team structured the deal, which is a strong example of how Airbus aircraft find a second life with many customers worldwide. Allegiant currently owns a fleet of 34 Airbus A320 Family aircraft, with 17 in their own service (7 A319s and 10 A320s), and the balance either pending service or leased out to other operators. The newly ordered A320 will be powered by CFM56 engines from CFM International.

“By the end of 2016, Allegiant will be a majority Airbus carrier as measured by available seat miles,” said Jude Bricker, Allegiant Travel Company senior vice president of planning. “This is an exciting milestone for Allegiant having taken delivery of our first Airbus aircraft just in 2013.”

“What happens in Vegas is what is happening around the world,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “Allegiant is among the growing ranks of low-cost carriers that appreciate the A320 Family as the perfect balance of comfort, economy and efficiency. Allegiant just marked its 50th consecutive profitable quarter and our aircraft in their fleet helped achieve that accomplishment.”

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with over 11,800 orders to date and more than 6,600 aircraft delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide. Thanks to its widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18” wide seats in economy as standard, underpinning its market leading position.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997350573539734}",positive,0.9997350573539734,1

IAG is to buy 11 long-haul aircraft destined for BA’s Spanish sister airline Iberia, as well as 20 short-haul planes to be used for fleet replacement across the group, which includes the low-cost carrier Vueling.



The group said it had negotiated a substantial discount to the $5.2bn list price from Airbus. It secured options to buy the planes in 2013, which it was now converting into firm orders. The aircraft will be delivered between 2016 and 2021.



Wings for all the various models are manufactured in Britain at Airbus’s plant in Broughton, and UK suppliers contribute to the aircraft landing gear and avionics. The engines for the eight A350-900s will be manufactured by Rolls-Royce.



Along with the A350s, IAG will be taking on three more A330 widebody aircraft, and 20 short-haul single-aisle planes, Airbus A320neos. IAG said the “modern, fuel-efficient aircraft will bring both cost efficiencies and environmental benefits to the airlines’ fleets”.



Airbus described the IAG order as “very significant for us”. The jet manufacturer’s chief operating officer, John Leahy, said it was “a great endorsement”.



The A350, regarded as Airbus’s direct competitor to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, entered service earlier this year and Airbus now has 780 firm orders for the model.

The deal with no-frills carrier IndiGo, which confirms an earlier provisional order for the planes, is the single-largest order for Airbus.

The wings for Airbus’s A320 planes will be made at Broughton in north Wales, before being sent on to aircraft production lines in Hamburg, Toulouse or China.

The company employs 16,000 people in the UK and produces 1,000 aircraft wings a year at the Broughton plant. The aerospace industry is worth about £24bn a year to the UK economy and it is seen by the government – along with the automotive sector – as a poster child for British manufacturing.

However, Airbus has warned recently that a British exit from the EU could threaten the presence of the Franco-German group in the UK. Speaking in May, the UK head of Airbus, Paul Kahn, said: “If, after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the UK? Yes, absolutely.”

The latest deal extends the lead of Airbus in the most lucrative market in commercial aerospace, for narrow-body planes, where it is pitched against US rival Boeing. The A320 family of planes, which includes the A320neo, the latest, most fuel-efficient model, are the most popular single-aisle aircraft in the world, with more than 11,800 orders to date and 6,600 aircraft delivered to 400 different airlines.

The plane competes against Boeing’s 737 and upgraded 737Max.

The US company has had 2,831 orders for is 737 Max plane, while Airbus has received more than 4,100 orders for the A320neo, including the latest IndiGo deal.

“It fills us with pride that IndiGo, India’s largest airline and one of the early launch customers for the A320neo, is coming back for more of our benchmark aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’s chief operating officer.

IndiGo is India’s largest airline by market share and was founded in 2006 by entrepreneur Rahul Bhatia and former US Airways chief executive Rakesh Gangwal. The airline is growing rapidly on the back of demand for air travel in India, as millions take to the skies for the first time.

India’s air travel market is forecast by the International Air Transport Association to become the third largest in the world by 2031, as well-established air travel markets in the US and Europe give way to the Middle East and Asia. Manufacturing plans at Airbus have reflected that shift in demand, with Airbus signing a deal for its second factory in China last month. It already operates an A320 assembly line in the city of Tianjin.

IndiGo’s A320neo planes will take off from 2018, with Airbus expected to deliver the planes between 2018-2026. The deal makes IndiGo the largest customer for the A320 family of aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979046583175659}",neutral,0.9979046583175659,0

India's IndiGo places record order for Airbus A320neo - RFI English,"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMvMjAxNTA4MTctaW5kaWFzLWluZGlnby1wbGFjZXMtcmVjb3JkLW9yZGVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwbmVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE - INDia

Indian low-cost airline IndiGo has placed a record 24-billion-euro order for European planemaker Airbus's A320neo passenger jet. The first A320neo left Airbus's plant in Toulouse, south-west France, in July 2014.

The order for 530 planes, with a catalogue-price value of 26.5 billion dollars (24 billion euros), is a record for Airbus.

It was signed on Indian independence day, 15 August, although the company first announced it would be placed in October 2014.

IndiGo, which is India's fastest-growing airline and, with 38.4 per cent of market share, its largest, ordered 100 A320s in 2005 and they have all been delivered.

In 2011 it became the first Indian company to buy the A320neo, bringing its Airbus fleet to 280.

There are now more than 4,000 orders for the A320neo, an Airbus statement said on Monday.

The plane's acronym stands for ""new engine option"" and a number of innovations mean that it uses 15 per cent less fuel than its predecessors and should use 20 per cent less by 2020, according to the plane-maker.

That means a reduction of CO2 emission of 5,000 tonnes per plane per year, Airbus claims.

Airbus Wins Patent For 'Concorde 2' Hypersonic Passenger Jet - HuffPost UK,"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvLnVrLzIwMTUvMDgvMDUvYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtcGF0ZW50LWZvci1jb25jb3JkZS0yLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWpldF9uXzc5Mzc4ODQuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvLnVrL2FtcC9lbnRyeS9haXJidXMtd2lucy1wYXRlbnQtZm9yLWNvbmNvcmRlLTItaHlwZXJzb25pYy1wYXNzZW5nZXItamV0X25fNzkzNzg4NC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has won a patent in the US for a hypersonic passenger jet that's being nicknamed 'Concorde 2'. The proposed jet could cut the flying time of Paris to Tokyo from 12 hours to just 3 hours.

Advertisement

The original Concorde could reach a top speed of Mach 2.5.

Hoping to combat some of the problems that hampered the original Concorde jet, Airbus' astonishing concept would use three separate propulsion systems to launch the plane to an impressive 100,00ft.

'Concorde 2' would take off like a regular passenger plane using a normal jet engine, once it reached a certain altitude a conventional rocket booster would then push the jet to 18 miles above the Earth's surface.

Once at an altitude of around 100,000ft it would use a ramjet engine to push the plane to an impressive Mach 4.5 - over twice the speed that Concorde managed when it was in service.

While Concorde suffered numerous technical difficulties, the biggest hindrance to its success was the 'sonic boom' problem. Heard from miles away, Concorde's sonic boom was so loud that many countries ended up restricting supersonic travel over land almost making the Concorde's biggest feature seem redundant.

The Airbus concept would avoid this issue entirely by going hypersonic, pushing the aircraft above the ceiling where a sonic boom would be heard by those on the ground.

If you're hoping to see this concept hit the skies any time soon then we're afraid we have some bad news. Airbus has released a statement which points out that for the company, 'Concorde 2' is just business as usual.

“Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property, these patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realised technology or product.”

Is Hypersonic Travel The Future?

Both the military and civilian sectors have been looking for ways to beat the sound barrier for years and while it's technically now considered child's play, the fact remains that socially, it's pretty unpleasant.

Sonic booms are loud and at close range can cause direct harm to windows and your grandparent's old crockery, they're also really irritating.

To try and beat this new methods of propulsion have been developed ranging from updating old WW2 technology to taking passengers into space.

The US military has been heavily investing in the X-51 'Waverider' a powerful hypersonic missile that has a theoretical top speed of Mach 24.

Now while that speed would almost certainly result in your immediate death, the 'Waverider' is not actually a bad model for future passenger planes.

Using the same 'scramjet' or pulse jet engines that were first truly developed during the Second World War, the scram jet uses supersonic compressed air which is then passed through the combustion chamber.

This relatively simple concept has very few moving parts making it cheaper to produce and easier to maintain.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7964142560958862}",neutral,0.7964142560958862,0

"Airbus A340-500/600 fleet profile: Lufthansa, Iberia retain large fleets, Asian airlines retire them | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Tue, 25 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzQwLTUwMDYwMC1mbGVldC1wcm9maWxlLWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1pYmVyaWEtcmV0YWluLWxhcmdlLWZsZWV0cy1hc2lhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1yZXRpcmUtdGhlbS0yMzU5NDjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lufthansa and Iberia are the largest A340-500/600 operators, followed by Etihad and Virgin

CAPA's fleet database tracks the 132 A340-500 and -600s produced. Of these, 89 are in active service: five are with governments, one with a charter operator (Hi Fly) and the balance with scheduled airlines.

Two airlines (Lufthansa and Iberia) account for 46% of the in-service fleet while five airlines (also including Etihad, Virgin Atlantic and South African Airways) account for 81% of the in-service fleet.

In-service A340-500s and -600s by operator: 17-Jul-2015

Johannesburg-New York JFK longest A340-600 route, Madrid-Mexico City largest route

The two main A340-600 operators, Lufthansa and Iberia, dominate the list of the 10 largest routes for the A340-500/600. The exception is the largest route, Johannesburg-New York JFK, operated by South African Airways. SAA became the operator of the longest A340-500/600 route after Singapore Airlines ended Singapore-Los Angeles/Newark services.

Notably, all of the 10 longest routes are flown by the A340-600, consistent with airlines no longer favouring the A340-500 as an ultra-long-haul aircraft, as it was originally meant to be. The A340-500 was used by Emirates for Dubai-New York JFK service and Etihad for Abu Dhabi-Melbourne service but these have since transitioned to 777 or A380s.

Etihad also used the A340-600 for Abu Dhabi-Sydney (now 777 and A380). All three of these routes are longer than Iberia's Madrid-Santiago service, meaning they would have been the longest A340-500/600 routes after SAA's Johannesburg-New York JFK service.

The list of the largest A340-500/600 routes based on ASKs is titled towards Iberia, which operates more than daily service on many of its A340-600 routes, whereas SAA and Lufthansa fly each of their longest A340-600 routes once a day.

Virgin Atlantic, with two daily A340-600 London Heathrow-New York JFK flights, has the eighth largest A340-500/600 route based on ASKs.

2015 has brought the exit of Asian operators of the A340-500/600. Thai Airways retired its A340-600s, having previously retired A340-500s, while China Eastern has retired its A340-600s.

As CAPA previously wrote of Thai Airways' fleet changes:

the phase out of the A340-600 fleet has been accelerated significantly as the previous version of Thai's fleet plan did not envision phasing out the type until next decade. While Thai phased out its fleet of A340-500s, which had been used for non-stop services to the US, in 2011 it was initially intending to retain its A340-600s for several years as the aircraft are still relatively young. Thai's A340-600 fleet is only nine years old on average with some aircraft being only six years old, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. But the four-engine aircraft, which Thai configures with only 266 seats, is highly inefficient even with the reduction in fuel prices. With the A340-500s already phased out at a relatively young age it makes sense for Thai to entirely remove the A340 family. Thai uses its A340-600s and 747-400s on long-haul services to Europe as well as some regional flights within Asia-Pacific including Australia. Thai will need to cut capacity to Europe as it removes from service six A340-600 and eight 747-400 passenger aircraft. But such cuts are feasible as Thai has a pressing need to adjust its European operation in response to current market conditions.

China Eastern had a smaller fleet comprising five A340-600s that the carrier used for services to Los Angeles, New York JFK and Paris CDG. The aircraft were withdrawn as it started receiving aircraft from its order for 20 777-300ERs. China Eastern saw the lack of an economical widebody holding back its long-haul network from capacity growth and attaining profits. China Eastern did not think it had a chance at long-haul profitability so long as it had the A340-600.

China Eastern said in a statement the aircraft had ""high operation costs and have relatively weak route competitiveness"". China Eastern sold the aircraft to Boeing as part of the 777 order. China Eastern said the aircraft had an unaudited book value of CNY4.47 billion (USD708 million), a figure that was surely revised downwards significantly.

Singapore Airlines in Oct-2013 withdrew its A340-500s used on Singapore-Los Angeles/Newark non-stops, the world's two longest flights at the time. Singapore Airlines is now looking to acquire new ultra-long-haul aircraft to resume non-stop service to the US (existing services transit via Asia or Europe), but this would mostly be for network benefits with likely marginal profitability. Since SIA announced it would end non-stop services, a number of foreign carriers have targeted the Singapore market.

Cathay Pacific operated three A340-600s for non-stop Hong Kong-New York JFK service as an interim measure until 777-300ERs were available. The longer distance from Singapore to the US limited aircraft options.

Iberia requires A340-600s for hot and high destinations. Lufthansa also holding on to A340-600s

Iberia is the second largest operator of the A340-600, with 17 (12 base -600s and 5 -HGWs). Enrique Dupuy, CFO of Iberia parent company IAG, remarked in Feb-2015 of the A340-600 in the context of potentially moderating capital expenditure: ""That's an aircraft that one year ago at USD120 per barrel was a nightmare. Today at USD60 per barrel and...because we are protected through asset value guarantees to sell and re-lease back at very efficient new ownership costs, it makes a lot of sense.""

Iberia has not determined an exit date for its A340-600s, but for operational reasons will need to keep some as it needs the aircraft to serve four hot and high destinations in the Americas: Mexico City, San Jose, Bogota and Quito.

Iberia does not consider its other long-haul aircraft in service and on order - A340-300, A330-200/300, A350-900 - as capable of serving those hot and high destinations.

Iberia Americas route map: Nov-2014

The A340-300 and -600 comprise 77% of Iberia's long-haul capacity in 2014, but Iberia expects to reduce this to 38% in 2020 (by which time its remaining seven A340-300s will be retired).

Iberia expects a 10% gain in fuel savings between 2014 and 2020 by shifting to newer and more economical aircraft, with a benefit in excess of EUR100 million.

Lufthansa is the largest operator of the A340-600 with 24 (12 base -600s and 12 -HGWs). It plans to gradually phase these out by age. Lufthansa's A340-600s vary in age between 6.5 and 12 years. They have an average age of 9.3 years compared to 12 for Lufthansa's entire A340 family (including -300s).

Lufthansa average fleet age: as of Jul-2015

No final exit date has been set, but by 2025 Lufthansa plans to have a long-haul fleet of A380, 747-8i, 777-9X, A350-900 and A330-300. Lufthansa expects a 20% CASK reduction as 777-9X and A350-900s replace older aircraft, including A340-600s.

The four-engined aircraft may have at least a temporary reprieve at Lufthansa. Given the Group's indifferent financial status, CEO Carsten Spohr stated in Mar-2015 that low oil prices were influencing fleet strategy by making older aircraft more attractive, according to Reuters: ""The fuel going down allows us to extend old aircraft without having similar disadvantages as in the past, at the same time as reducing investment numbers.""

Lufthansa fleet development: as of Jan-2015

Virgin Atlantic was the launch customer for the A340-600 and even borrowed Airbus' ""4 engines 4 long-haul"" slogan, which it quietly dropped as there was no financial return in that statement, and Virgin now operates twin-engined A330s and 787-9s. 41% of Virgin's long-haul fleet is now comprised of twin-engined aircraft, up from zero a few years ago. Virgin has 11 A340-600s, down from a peak of 19.

At least one needy airline has been a beneficiary of the moves to reduce A340-600 numbers. Two of Virgin's A340-600s have found their way to Iran's Mahan Air via a number of third parties and are in service. In total Mahan Air expects to operate seven A340-600s.

South African Airways needs A340-600 replacement

Like Iberia, SAA says it is seeing reprieve at its A340-600 fleet due to lower fuel prices. SAA has been restructuring its long-haul network by cutting routes and forming partnerships. A planned premium economy cabin should also help. Now the largest obstacle is its long-haul fleet. SAA operates 23 widebody aircraft, including eight A340-300s and nine A340-600s.

South African Airways Fleet Summary: as at 19-Jul-2015

SAA for some years has tried to re-fleet but has encountered obstacles, mostly from the South African government that has unhelpfully interfered in the flag carrier's decision making. SAA is once again looking at re-fleeting, hoping it will be allowed to proceed with an agreement perhaps in 2016. As CAPA previously wrote:

SAA expects it now may not phase out its A340s until 2020 or 2021, which gives it the opportunity to consider the 777X and A350-1000. Earlier evaluations focused on the 787 and smaller version of the A350, including a 2012 evaluation which resulted in the recommendation to purchase about 30 A350s. (The SAA board never approved or endorsed this recommendation). SAA is still looking at potentially acquiring 10 787s, A350-900s or current variants of the 777 with a potential selection in 2016 and deliveries well before 2020. But this acquisition would meet only part of its widebody fleet requirement and would not enable it to phase out its entire A340 fleet. SAA's widebody fleet currently consists of six A330-200s, eight A340-300s and nine A340-600s. The A340 fleet is on average 12 years old while the A330s are only four years old, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. But the A330s were initially acquired as interim aircraft and were therefore leased rather than purchased, giving SAA the flexibility to replace both its A330s and A340s with new generation aircraft.

Etihad has A340-500s and -600s while Emirates is retiring its -500s

Of the A340-500/600 family, the A340-500 generated lower demand, with only 34 built. Etihad and Azerbaijan Airlines are the only scheduled airline operators of the A340-500, and Etihad is the only operator of both the A340-500 and -600.

Etihad has four A340-500s and seven A340-600s for a total of 11. It has not stated retirement plans for the aircraft, although they are being removed from long haul routes, such as Abu Dhabi-Melbourne/Sydney.

Etihad is generally in need of long haul aircraft, hence acquiring 777s from Air India and Jet Airways. Etihad's A340 fleet (which comprises only -500s and -600s and no earlier models) accounts for approximately 9% of global seat and ASK capacity.

Etihad system seat capacity by aircraft type: 20-Jul-2015 to 26-Jul-2015

The A340-500 was for a while something of a flagship aircraft for Emirates, being used to open non-stop Dubai-New York JFK service.

But now Emirates has only one A340-500 left in service, and schedules from OAG show it operating just one daily flight from Dubai to Kabul. Elsewhere in the Gulf, Qatar Airways has four A340-600s used on medium/long-haul routes to Kuala Lumpur, London Heathrow and Paris CDG as well as to Dubai.

A340-500/600s look to future years: retrofits, secondary market starts

Many airlines with A340-500/600s find themselves asking what to do with their fleets. The recent large dip in fuel prices is providing respite from operating inefficiencies, and it appears low fuel prices may persist into the short-term. But few airlines expect this to last, and so continue to asses options. Qatar Airways has introduced a retrofitted A340-600 version that sees the elimination of first class, a reduced business cabin and a larger economy cabin.

Meanwhile the second-hand market is growing. Boeing is re-marketing China Eastern's A340-600s (which the airframer took as part of a deal to sell 777s to China Eastern) while Iran's Mahan Air has acquired ex-Virgin Atlantic A340-600s through back channels. Although these aircraft may not bring efficiency, they are often young widebodies. But with the only major second-hand operator being an airline - Mahan Air - that is under international sanctions, the second-hand market is not bright.

Airbus introduced a high-density plan for the aircraft, but the retrofit expense and continued high unit operating costs have not yet convinced the industry. 777-200ERs are increasingly on the market, and there is an expectation -300ERs will start to enter the market as well, further challenging opportunities for the A340-500/600.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",neutral,0.9999995231628418,0

I am very proud to present this Project Airbus (pa321) Airbus A321-231 with the distinction of being the ""7000th Airbus"". This was just delivered earlier this month (December) to US Airways. It is registered as N552UW. The ""7000th Airbus"" logo is on the right ride of the port side main entry. The A321 is the medium-haul workhorse for US Airways and flies into most major US airports serviced by US Airways including; KCLT, KPHX, KLAX, KSFO, KORD, KMCO, KSAN among others. The A321's also do service Caribbean destinations for US Airways as well. This is a detailed repaint with custom textures. The repainted textures in this package are 32-bit with no mipmaps for best clarity and quality.

Installation:

This is a complete install. The Project Airbus A321-231 model and air files are included. The panel and sound are from the default 737-400, but if you read below, I have some recommendations for a A32x panel and IAE soundset. Unzip this package directly into your Aircraft folder.

Then, browse to \Aircraft\Project Airbus A320-214 if you're installing a CFM-engine livery, or \Aircraft\Project Airbus A320-232 if you're installing an IAE-engine livery. Inside that folder, simply double click the _Livery Installer_PA.bat file to complete the livery installation. On completion, the installer will leave behind an aircraft.backup file should you wish to reverse the changes.

Airport Surveillance Radar From Airbus Defence And Space Monitors Australian Airbases - RF Globalnet,"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZ2xvYmFsbmV0LmNvbS9kb2MvYWlycG9ydC1zdXJ2ZWlsbGFuY2UtcmFkYXItYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2Utc3BhY2UtbW9uaXRvcnMtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1haXJiYXNlcy0wMDAx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"€130M contract enhances Air Traffic Control capabilities of the Royal Australian Air Force

Airbus Defence and Space has received two contracts worth approximately €130M from Australia’s new Capability, Acquisition and Sustainment Group to equip and support nine military and civil/military Australian airfields with the world’s newest and most powerful airport surveillance sensors. Under the project “AIR 5431 Phase 2 – Fixed Defence Air Traffic Control Surveillance Sensors” ten ASR-NG (Airport Surveillance Radar - Next Generation) radars will provide enhanced input into the Australian National Air Traffic Management Surveillance picture and contribute to the achievement of Air Battle Management missions. Deliveries, including nine complete and one training system, are planned until end 2020.

“ASR-NG provides outstanding performance for wide-area surveillance around airbases as well as safe guidance of individual aircraft during take-off and landing”, said Thomas Müller, head of Airbus Defence and Space’s Electronics business line. The system also includes the secondary radar MSSR 2000 I allowing for reliable individual identification of more than two thousand transponder-equipped aircraft at a time. Other key features of the ASR-NG are the proven ability to mitigate wind farm effects, and a significant increase of the primary radar’s detection range to 120 NM (220 km). Additionally, it provides a new 3D height measurement of the primary radar and is resistant to interference by 4G/LTE mobile phone signals.

ASR-NG consists of a solid state primary radar using an advanced signal processing technology for medium and long-range air traffic surveillance. With its recently completed primary radar 3D height measurement capability, ASR-NG closes the gap between a Tactical Medium Range Air Surveillance Radar and a classical Air Traffic Control radar combining operational advantages of both at excellent value for money ratio. With its extraordinary detection capabilities for even slow flying or hovering helicopters above heavy clutter areas, ASR-NG meets operational needs for military air traffic and mission area control. ASR-NG integrates with the MSSR 2000 I (Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar) secondary radar for automatic identification of individual cooperative aircraft. It meets the requirements for the military and highly encrypted identification ‘Mode 5’, as well as the civil air traffic control ‘Mode S’ and ‘ADS-B’ requirements, which greatly improve aircraft identification security and safety.

About Airbus Defence and Space

Airbus Defence and Space supplies air traffic control and identification systems in the military and civilian sector worldwide. Amongst others, the company equips the German Armed Forces’ airports with the ASR-S (Airport Surveillance Radar, S-Band) airport surveillance radar and delivers an approach control system for the military airfields in Switzerland. ASR-NG is contracted to be delivered to the Royal Canadian Air Force and in the frame of the MARSHALL programm as well to the Royal Air Force in United Kingdom. In particular, the MSSR 2000 I secondary radar is deployed by the naval forces of Australia, UK, Germany, France, Norway and Finland for military friend-or-foe identification. For civil and military air traffic control, those identification systems are used in countries such as Germany, France, USA, UK, Bulgaria and the Philippines.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999984860420227}",positive,0.999984860420227,1
Airbus to Use Kazakh-Produced Metal in Aircraft Production - Astana Times,"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXN0YW5hdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDgvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXVzZS1rYXpha2gtcHJvZHVjZWQtbWV0YWwtaW4tYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aircrafts will be produced using metal from Kazakhstan. The only titanium magnesium plant in Kazakhstan has received trade financing and has an opportunity to increase export volumes, reported Khabar TV Channel.

The soft loans will enable the plant to purchase materials to produce titanium sponge, alloys and ingots, which are used in the aerospace industry.

Airbus confirmed that it is going to purchase a portion of the products. However, Airbus hasn’t disclosed which of its aircraft parts will be produced using Kazakh metal. This information is considered to be confidential.

The Kazakh government created the KAZNEX INVEST agency a few years ago to provide state financial support to businesses, such as the plant that will supply metal to Airbus. Major companies received 35 billion tenge (US$140 million) under the programme and 15 billion tenge (US$60 million) more is expected to be provided.

“As of today, Kazakhstan produces seven percent of world titanium and magnesium production. We hope that state support will help to increase this volume several times,” said Managing Director of KAZNEX INVEST Askar Arynov.

Today, 16 Airbus aircrafts are used in Kazakhstan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994518160820007}",neutral,0.9994518160820007,0

Frontier Airlines Airbus A319 in N931FR (Bear) livery.

These are 3 repaints from Overland's wonderful A319 model. They depict N931FR (Bear), N945FR (Moose), and N950FR (Dolphin). These repaints are a continuation of my work from my previous repaint, N916FR (Mallard Duck). The textures are saved without mip maps so there won't be any blurries, and thumbnails are included. These are textures only; you need SMS' payware A319 for these textures to work. Enjoy! The tails and winglets are photoreal, and the letters and everything else are handpainted.These textures are saved without mip maps, which means they will not show up blurry in the simulator.

If you're using Flight Simulator 2004, place the folders ""texture.N931FR"", ""texture.N945FR, and ""texture.N950FR"" in:

C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Flight Simulator 9/Aircraft/SMS_A319_W

Qatar Airways to add more seats to Bangkok with Airbus A380s - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC8xMS9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLXRvLWFkZC1tb3JlLXNlYXRzLXRvLWJhbmdrb2std2l0aC1haXJidXMtYTM4MHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It seems that Qatar Airways is pushing out the boat in terms of capacity, where it’ll be operating up to three of its four daily flights between Doha and Bangkok from the 25th October 2015.



Qatar Airways Airbus A380s at Hamad International Airport, Doha – Image, Economy Class and Beyond

QR832/QR837 will operate five times a week (Wednesday through Sunday) with an Airbus A380, whilst on Monday and Tuesday it will operate with a Boeing 777-300ER.

Currently, Qatar Airways operate 7 flights a week, which is due to be doubled from the 16th September.

The combined timetable looks like this:

Doha Hamad International Airport to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi QR834 DEPART DOH 01:25 ARRIVE BKK 11:35 Boeing 777-300ER QR836 DEPART DOH 01:55 ARRIVE BKK 12:10 Airbus A380 QR832 DEPART DOH 08:30 ARRIVE BKK 18:40 Mon/Tue B777-300ER, Wed-Sun A380 QR830 DEPART DOH 21:00 ARRIVE BKK 07:10+1 Airbus A380 Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Doha Hamad International Airport QR837 DEPART BKK 01:40 ARRIVE DOH 04:40 Tues/Weds B777-300ER, Thur-Mon A380 QR831 DEPART BKK 08:35 ARRIVE DOH 11:50 Airbus A380 QR835 DEPART BKK 19:55 ARRIVE DOH 23:10 Boeing 777-300ER QR833 DEPART BKK 20:45 ARRIVE DOH 23:55 Airbus A380 Commences from Doha 25th October 2015 Equipment as listed. Subject to variation Data: Airlineroute

Considering that a Qatar Airways A380 has 517 seats aboard, there will be a lot of capacity going between Doha and Bangkok.

Qatar Airways operate their A380s with a three class product (First, Business and Economy Class), so there should be some room for everybody on this expansion – as well as some reward tickets I hope.

• Idle reversers – reversers stay open for a couple of seconds after they have been shut off, open full when only idle reverse thrust is selected

• Parallel bogies – in the double-bogey model (used by Indian Airlines)

• Dynamic jetwash – visible only when engines running

• Dropping surfaces – elevators and ailerons drop when engines are shut off

Also:

• Opening passenger and cargo doors

• Custom effects – double strobes, navigation and beacon lights, as well as touchdown effects

• Dynamic shine

• Wingviews

• Accurate landing gear extension and retraction

Win a Model of Singapore Airlines’ Special 50th Anniversary Livery on an Airbus A380 - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC93aW4tbW9kZWwtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLXNwZWNpYWwtNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1saXZlcnktYWlyYnVzLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NOTE: The contest has now ended. If you didn’t win, but still want of these sweet models — you can still buy one direct. Thanks for participating and wait for our next one!

Luckily for us, many airlines have come up with special liveries over the years creating an extra sense of wonder when you spot one out in the wild.

Recently, Singapore Airlines unveiled a livery to celebrate the country’s 50th anniversary (SQ50) and we wanted to do a little celebrating with them and you. The airline was nice enough to offer two (very nice) models of the Airbus A380, wearing this livery. Read on to learn more and to possibly win!

ABOUT THE SINGAPORE AIRLINES SQ50 AIRBUS A380 MODEL

According to the airline, this model is, “a limited edition replica of the Singapore Airlines SG50 livery aircraft. Made of hard ABS plastic with a perfect snap fit construction, this highly detailed superior graphics true-to-scale 1:200 A380 model comes with landing gears and a display stand.”

This model is legit and not small. It’s length is 14.3’ and the 15.7 ” wingspan is impressive.

If you do not end up winning and still want to get one… you can. They are $128 (plus a 10% discount going on right now) on the Singapore Airlines Kris Shop.

ABOUT THE SINGAPORE SQ50 A380

There is no missing this livery, especially when it is on the giant A380. On both sides of the aircraft is a large Singaporean flag-themed design and the inboard engines have a SG50 logo. Making a design like this isn’t easy – here are some interesting facts about the design:

The special decal used for the large flag portion was divided into about 50 panels for each plane

The printing of the decal took about five days, on a 24/7 basis

12 rolls of decal materials were used, and each roll was about 4′ by 164′

The amount of decal material used can cover 56 double-decker buses

The decal application took about eight days

SPECIAL FARES TO CELEBRATE SQ50

To further celebrate Singapore’s 50th Anniversary, Singapore Airlines is not only making fancy models, but letting you fly for pretty darn cheap. They are offering $850 Economy Class fares to Singapore from its four US gateways: New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), and Houston (IAH).

The special deal started on Singapore’s Golden Jubilee on August 9, 2015 and they must be booked by September 27, 2015 for travel between September 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016. Book your flight, learn more, and read the restrictions on their website.

HOW TO WIN THE SQ50 MODEL

NOTE: The contest has now ended and comments are now closed. If you didn’t win, but still want of these sweet models — you can still buy one direct. Thanks for participating and wait for our next one!

Let’s get to the good stuff. You probably want one of those sweet SQ50 A380 models. Answer the question below in the comments and the person closest to the right answer will win.

"Hail damages Delta plane, forces emergency landing - CNN","Sun, 09 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC8wOC91cy9kZWx0YS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1oYWlsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Delta Flight 1889 was headed from Boston to Salt Lake City when it flew through storm Pilots made emergency landing in Denver; windshields were cracked, nose cone was damaged ""This was the scariest 10 minutes of my life,"" passenger tells KSTU

CNN —

The passengers and the photos of cracked windshields and a damaged nose cone tell the same story: Friday evening’s Delta Flight 1889 was intense.

Hail pelted the plane as it flew through a thunderstorm, damaging part of the aircraft and forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing in Denver, officials said.

“I fly constantly, and this was the scariest 10 minutes of my life,” passenger Robin Jones told CNN affiliate KSTU.

The Airbus A320 departed Boston and was scheduled to land in Salt Lake City, Utah, but the weather prompted the pilots to land in Denver, the nearest suitable airport once the storm hit, Delta spokeswoman Liz Savadelis said.

One person was taken to a hospital after the 8:42 p.m. MT landing, Denver International Airport spokeswoman Laura Coale said. Coale didn’t provide a reason, but did say the plane went through “severe turbulence.”

Jones took a different flight to Salt Lake after landing in Denver, and spoke to KSTU upon arriving.

“I thought, ‘OK. Have I told everybody that I love that I love them?’” Jones said, recalling the earlier flight. “And as soon as I realized I had done that, I was like, ‘I’m all right. Everything’s going to be OK.’ “

Savadelis said plane had cracked windshields and damage to the radome – the nose cone area that houses weather radar and navigational equipment. Details on whether that equipment was damaged weren’t immediately available.

Passengers posted pictures of the damage to social media.

Passenger Rob Wessman told KSTU about seeing the damage after departing the plane.

“We went around the corner from the window, we could see the shattered windshield,” Wessman said. “… We could see the nose of the plane was missing. It was really intense.”

Delta said it put Flight 1889 passengers on other flights so that they could continue their trips.

The Federal Aviation Administration said it would investigate the incident.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8468140959739685}",negative,0.8468140959739685,-1
Airbus patents supersonic plane that could hit Mach 4.5 - CBC News,"Wed, 05 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3NjaWVuY2UvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudHMtc3VwZXJzb25pYy1wbGFuZS10aGF0LWNvdWxkLWhpdC1tYWNoLTQtNS0xLjMxNzg5NTXSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMzE3ODk1NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A rocket-plane that could fly from Vancouver to Tokyo in three hours instead of 10 has been patented by Airbus.

The U.S. patent for an ""ultra-rapid air vehicle and related method for aerial locomotion"" was awarded to Airbus, also known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, in July.

Airbus said the plane would be targeted mainly at business travel and VIP passengers ""who require transcontinental return journeys within one day,"" and at the military.

The document states that the supersonic plane could carry 20 passengers or two to three tonnes and reach up to 4.5 times the speed of sound (Mach 4.5) — around 5,500 kilometres per hour.

That would allow it to fly about 9,000 kilometres from Paris to San Francisco (currently an 11-hour flight) or Tokyo to Los Angeles (currently a 10-hour flight) in three hours, the patent says.

Observers such as Deepak Gupta, founder of the Gurgaon, India-based intellectual property drafting service Patent Yogi, have remarked that at Mach 4.5, the plane could cover the 5,600-kilometre distance between New York and London, normally a seven to eight hour flight, in an hour. However, that doesn't take into account that the plane wouldn't be at its top speed for the entire duration of the flight.

The plane would achieve its extreme speed with a combination of three sets of engines — turbojets for taxiing, takeoff and landing; a rocket motor for rapid acceleration; and ramjets for high-altitude cruising. The turbojets and rocket motor fold into the body of plane when not in use and the plane also has adjustable fins to make it more aerodynamic. It would be fuelled by hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

The speed of the plane would be double that of two previously built supersonic planes, neither of which is still in service:

The Concorde, built by Aerospatiale and British Aircraft Corp.

The Tupolev Tu-144 or ""Charger"" built by Voronezh Aircraft Production Association.

No sonic boom on ground

But the patent says its main improvement over those two is that it reduces the noise of the sonic boom — a loud bang caused by shockwaves created by an object moving faster than the speed of sound.

""This noise has been the main limit, if not the only one, preventing the opening of lines other than transatlantic ones for the Concorde aircraft,"" the patent says.

The plane does that by being ""near-vertical,"" like a rocket, while ramping up to supersonic speed and its cruising altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 metres — 20 kilometres higher than conventional commercial aircraft.

Similarly it would descend at a ""steep gradient.""

The sound energy dissipates in a ring around the plane, parallel to the ground, so that no shockwave hits the ground.

The only noise would be directly under the plane, ""is confined to the vicinity of the airport and lasts for roughly less than one minute,"" the patent says.

That caused Gupta to describe it as a ""supersonic roller-coaster"" in a video featuring the new patent.

If you're eager to give it a try, don't get too excited yet.

When asked about the patent, Airbus said it files for hundreds of patents a year.

""These patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualization, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realized technology or product,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""Therefore at this time, we will not be providing any interviews or further information on this topic.""

Airbus has filed other unusual aircraft patents in the past.

For example, last summer, it filed a patent to bicycle-style seats on planes that would make it possible to cram more passengers in the same amount of space. And last fall, it patented an aircraft cabin shaped like a giant flying saucer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999532699584961}",neutral,0.9999532699584961,0
