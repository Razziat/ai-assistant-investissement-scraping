The solar array technology features the Northrop Grumman Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) design that utilizes a telescoping boom system to deploy an accordion-folded flexible solar array blanket. The solar arrays are a 20kW-class system that deploys over 18 meters in order to provide energy to OneSat.

“The technology used for our solar arrays allows for an efficient launch and is one of our many company-designed advanced components that enable satellites of all classes to perform their missions,” said Frank Bernas, vice president, space components and strategic businesses, Northrop Grumman.

Northrop Grumman’s CTA system was developed for missions like OneSat that require extremely compact stowage volume for spacecraft launch while remaining lightweight. Northrop Grumman’s CTA creates enough space to allow for three full spacecraft to be launched aboard a single rocket.

The use of Northrop Grumman’s solar arrays to support the OneSat product line builds on the company’s history of mission-enabling capability through solar technology. These technologies are used to support various commercial and civil space programs, including the commercial resupply of the International Space Station through the company’s Cygnus spacecraft, several of its commercial satellites and NASA’s Insight and Phoenix Mars Landers.

In addition to the solar arrays, Northrop Grumman will also provide heat pipes that are an essential element for payload thermal management as well as propellant tanks in support of a mono-propellant propulsion system for OneSat.

Northrop Grumman solves the toughest problems in space, aeronautics, defense and cyberspace to meet the ever evolving needs of our customers worldwide. Our 97,000 employees define possible every day using science, technology and engineering to create and deliver advanced systems, products and services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982776641845703}",neutral,0.9982776641845703,0

Providing visibility to suppliers and calling for rate readiness

Toulouse, 27 May 2021 – Airbus continues to expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment. The Company is therefore providing suppliers with an update of its production plans, giving visibility in order to schedule necessary investments and secure long term capacity and production rate readiness, in line with the expected recovery.

“The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis”, said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.”

A320 Family: Airbus confirms an average A320 Family production rate of 45 aircraft per month in Q4 2021 and calls on suppliers to prepare for the future by securing a firm rate of 64 by Q2 2023. In anticipation of a continued recovering market, Airbus is also asking suppliers to enable a scenario of rate 70 by Q1 2024. Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 by 2025.



A220 Family: Currently at around rate five aircraft per month from Mirabel and Mobile, the rate is confirmed to rise to around six in early 2022. Airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade.



A350 Family: Currently at an average production rate of five per month, this is expected to increase to six by autumn 2022.



A330 Family: Production remains at an average monthly production rate of two per month.



Airbus is protecting its ability to further adapt as the market evolves.

Airbus Fly-by-wire Visionary Bernard Ziegler - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXZpc2lvbmFyeS1iZXJuYXJkLXppZWdsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Fly-by-wire Visionary Bernard Ziegler

DALLAS – Via a press release, Airbus informed today that Bernard Ziegler, former VP of engineering and fly-by-wire evangelist, passed away at the age of 88.

With the launch of the A320 in 1988, Ziegler, one of Airbus’ engineering pioneers, was instrumental in the world’s first digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) and side-stick controls in a commercial passenger aircraft. FBW controls pioneered by Airbus are now the standard in the airline industry.

Bernard Ziegler

Ziegler had a long and illustrious career that spanned four decades. He saw the full potential of digital FBW, including the integration of flight envelope protection into the control software. Ziegler’s legacy lives on in the form of digital FBW on all current-generation Airbus aircraft, as well as its implementation as a global standard on all new passenger aircraft.

Ziegler was born in Boulogne sur Seine in 1933 and attended several engineering and flight training schools (Ecole Nationale de l’Air, Ecole de Chasse, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l’Aéronautique, Ecole du Personnel Navigant Essais). He served in the French Air Force as a fighter pilot for ten years.

He studied aeronautical engineering at Toulouse’s ENSA (Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l’Aéronautique), which is now ISAE-SUPAERO, in the early 1960s. After that, he went to the prestigious EPNER flight test pilot school before pursuing a career as a military test pilot.

In 1972, Ziegler joined Airbus as its chief test pilot and was tasked with establishing a new flight test division. He put together a team that shared the design office’s and partner countries’ goals, encouraging flight test crews and design engineers to collaborate.

Being a test pilot, Ziegler flew the first flight of the first A300 in 1972 as well as the A310, A320, and A340-200. Up until his retirement in December 1997, Ziegler was Airbus’s Senior Vice President of Engineering. He was the son of former Airbus CEO, Henri Ziegler.

Fly-by-wire Systems

Fly-by-wire systems are computer-controlled, semi-automatic aircraft flight control systems that use an electronic interface to replace mechanical flight controls. Computers often keep an eye on sensors all over the plane to make automatic changes that improve the flight.

Electrical signaling on secondary flight controls, which replaced the traditional web of cables and pulleys, was one of the A300-600 and A310’s notable developments, states Airbus.

With the next aircraft, Airbus co-founder Roger Béteille decided to take this evolution even further, to computer-controlled digital “fly-by-wire,” in which the deflections of the flying control surfaces on the wing and tail are no longer driven directly by the pilots’ controls, but rather by a computer that calculates exactly which control surface deflections are required to make the aircraft react as the pilot desires.

A simple side-stick control would replace the pilots’ control column.

Flight Envelope Protection and the Concept of Commonality

Fly-by-wire technology on the A320 was used for more than just improving flight controls and reducing weight. By implementing flight envelope protection, it allowed Airbus to take safety to a new level. The A320’s pilots were free to fly the plane freely, but the flight envelope protection stopped the plane from performing maneuvers that were beyond its capabilities.

Fly-by-wire was also key in solidifying the idea of commonality, which is so essential to the appeal of Airbus aircraft to customers. No matter how one aircraft varies in size or weight from another, FBW commonality allows the pilot to fly them in the same way because the computer “drives” the aircraft’s flight controls.

Will Airbus transform the aerospace industry? | Opinion | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi93aWxsLWFpcmJ1cy10cmFuc2Zvcm0tdGhlLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1pbmR1c3RyeS8xNDM3OTYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two years into the role, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury has developed a clear plan and is rapidly guiding the manufacturer through necessary transformational changes, writes Patriot Industrial Partners managing director Alex Krutz

Napoleon Bonaparte once said, “Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action comes, stop thinking and go in.”

Two years into his tenure as Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury seems to be following a similar mantra. He has developed a clear plan and embarked on a course of action, guiding Airbus through necessary transformational changes at a pace uncommon in the aerospace industry.

His actions seem likely to spur competitors, and the entire supply chain, into similar transformation.

Faury’s transformation plan is underway and appears to encompass three strategic initiatives: to improve Airbus’s design capabilities, modernise its manufacturing technology and consolidate its industrial footprint. These initiatives will support Airbus’s goal of producing a new hydrogen-powered aircraft with net zero emissions by 2035.

To transform its design capabilities, Airbus is using a new technology called “Digital Design Manufacturing and Services (DDMS)”, which digitally links the entire design, tooling, supply chain and manufacturing process. The results will ensure cost competitiveness and compress time-to-market for new aircraft, revolutionising Airbus’s development process.

Airbus is already transforming its factories with advanced manufacturing technologies, including semi-automated equipment and collaborative robotics. The results will enable higher production rates and more-efficient operations. Airbus is investing now, during an industry downturn, and taking advantage of reduced demand and production volumes.

The last – and boldest – of Airbus’s initiatives is its industrial-footprint consolidation.

A bit of historical context: In the early 2000s, aerospace companies were doing the opposite – carving out and spinning off aerostructures businesses and other divisions not considered core aircraft-manufacturing competencies. Airbus completed that work in late last decade when it spun off aerostructures divisions in France and Germany to form Premium Aerotec. It also carved out Aerolia and Sogerma, which later merged to form Stelia Aerospace. Airbus still owned the businesses but operated them separately from its aircraft manufacturing business.

But Faury, who considers aerostructures to be a core aircraft-design and manufacturing activity, is now reversing that work. The Toulouse company is reintegrating Premium and Stelia back into its core industrial operations, a move Faury believes will simplify governance and reduce bureaucracy. Also – and counter to conventional thinking – Faury believes integrated aerostructure operations will make Airbus more lean and agile, with dedicated capacity and shared objectives.

Folding aerostructures work back into its core operations will enable Airbus to better control its cost structure, and its ultimate destiny. The integrated aerostructures units will report to Airbus executives and benefit from more capital investment. In contrast, when independent, the companies could not invest financial resources in research, development and factory modernisation. These changes will have net positive competitiveness for Airbus and its supply chain.

Once Faury’s transformations are complete, Airbus will be better positioned – technologically and organisationally – to develop an industry leading zero-emissions aircraft. Faury’s actions are no accident. He is deliberately changing Airbus in ways that might transform the entire aerospace industry.

Airbus' Bullish Production Plans Aren't Good News for Boeing - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 29 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L2FpcmJ1cy1idWxsaXNoLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcGxhbnMtYXJlbnQtZ29vZC1uZXdzLWZvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus plans to boost narrow-body jet production to record levels within two years. Don't expect Boeing to follow suit.

Shares of Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) surged 9% on Thursday, after the European plane maker told suppliers to get ready for a rapid rebound in jet production. In fact, Airbus plans to boost output of narrow-body jets to record levels in as little as two years.

Boeing (BA -1.96%) stock also rose 4% on Thursday. Investors seem to believe that Airbus' aggressive production plans imply a robust aviation industry recovery that will lift demand for Boeing jets, too. Yet while narrow-body jet demand should fully recover by 2024, Airbus' plan also entails gaining market share from its American rival. Thus, Boeing shareholders shouldn't celebrate production increases at Airbus.

Planning for record narrow-body production

Last year, Airbus slashed its commercial jet production as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed demand. By the end of 2020, it was building about 51 aircraft per month: 40 A320-family jets, four A220s, two A330s, and five A350s. Earlier this year, it bumped up the A220 production rate to five per month.

On Thursday, Airbus confirmed that it intends to boost production for the A320 family to 45 per month by the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it called on suppliers to prepare for A320 production to reach a record rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, Airbus told suppliers that it hopes to boost the A320 production rate to 70 per month by early 2024 and as high as 75 per month in 2025.

Airbus also confirmed that it will increase A220 output to six per month in early 2022. Up until now, annual A220 deliveries have never exceeded 48 (i.e., four per month). Yet Airbus envisions building as many as 14 A220s per month ""by the middle of the decade.""

Gaining narrow-body market share

In one sense, Airbus' plans shouldn't be surprising. A320-family production topped out at 60 per month prior to the pandemic, but as far back as 2018, the aircraft manufacturer was interested in increasing output to more than 70 per month. Meanwhile, Airbus has planned to ramp up A220 output for years, thanks to a slew of orders from U.S. airlines that will be fulfilled from a new production line in Mobile, Alabama.

Nevertheless, aerospace analysts had expected a much slower recovery in production rates. After all, most experts think global air travel demand won't return to 2019 levels until 2023. Since growth aircraft typically account for more than half of all commercial jet deliveries, many analysts expected aircraft demand to remain well below pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.

Yet demand need not return to 2019 levels for Airbus to boost narrow-body output to record rates. Instead, it can rely on gaining market share at Boeing's expense. Indeed, Airbus ended April with 6,187 narrow-body jets in its order backlog, including over 5,600 A320neo-family aircraft. By contrast, Boeing's 737 backlog has fallen to just 3,239 units.

At the moment, Airbus' goal to boost A220 production to 14 per month is aspirational. At that rate, its current backlog of 494 unfilled orders would last just three years. By contrast, Airbus has enough A320neo-family orders to last for seven years at a rate of 70 per month. With a backlog that long, it's no wonder that the aircraft manufacturer is thinking about even higher production rates.

Boeing hopes to restore 737 output to as many as 42 per month by late 2022. That level of production -- 26% below the 57 per month rate Boeing was implementing prior to the 737 MAX grounding in 2019 -- should be sustainable. But barring a huge jump in orders that is unlikely to materialize, Boeing will never get close to building 63 737s each month, as it was contemplating in late 2018. Its current backlog would last barely more than four years at that production rate.

Wide-body demand remains weak

Whereas Airbus is poised to convert its backlog advantage over Boeing into an output advantage in the narrow-body market, the two plane makers' wide-body backlogs are evenly matched. Unfortunately for Boeing, wide-body demand remains quite weak and may never fully recover, due to the disruptive potential of Airbus' A321XLR.

In its recent production update, Airbus said it expects to continue building just two A330 wide-bodies per month for the foreseeable future. And while it plans to increase A350 production from five per month to six per month next fall, it had been building 10 A350s a month before the pandemic.

In short, Airbus' aggressive narrow-body production plans position it to seize market share from Boeing in that high-potential segment. Meanwhile, Airbus sees the current wide-body slump continuing indefinitely. Together, these developments suggest that Boeing's revenue, earnings, and cash flow will remain well below the highs reached in 2018 for the foreseeable future.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

The campaign, carried out in April over the south of Spain, covered four flights and involved the use of an Airbus C295 Intelligence Surveillance Recognition (ISR) testbed equipped with a Collins avionics package.

The aircraft performed standard maritime patrol missions with all sensors controlled in near real time by a mission operator based at a ground station at Airbus’ Getafe site. Sensor control was successfully handed over to the ground control station, with different surveillance tasks, including Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) pointing control and radar management, performed by the ground crew using the installed Ka band SATCOM.

During the tests, the ground operator’s situational awareness was complete, sharing the same set of tools and apps available in the onboard Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS) workstations, transforming the COMMOMISS ground station into an effective additional operator’s node.

Among its capabilities COMMOMISS will provide users with:

Additional operator’s nodes in the Mission Support Centre on the ground, providing operational flexibility in long and complex missions, sharing tasks between airborne and ground tactical crew members;

Integration with the operator’s C2 network, contributing to the generation of the Common Operational Picture;

Immediate access to all data gathered by onboard sensors for real time analysis with almost unlimited resources available on the ground;

The possibility to reduce the number of operators (and thus workstations) on board in persistent surveillance missions.

COMMOMISS will pave the future of airborne tactical mission systems, allowing a harmonised mission system architecture, human-machine interface (HMI) and concept of operations (CONOPS) for both, manned and unmanned air vehicles, as well as fixed-wing and rotatory wing aircraft. It supports a seamless integration into the overall system-of-systems, providing global situational awareness to operators and contributing to the generation of the Common Operational Picture (COP) in the context of ISR missions.

Airbus Fly-By-Wire visionary Bernard Ziegler passes away - Airbus,"Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNS1haXJidXMtZmx5LWJ5LXdpcmUtdmlzaW9uYXJ5LWJlcm5hcmQtemllZ2xlci1wYXNzZXMtYXdhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 5 May 2021 – Airbus is saddened to learn of the passing of Bernard Ziegler, at the age of 88. Ziegler, one of Airbus’ engineering pioneers, was instrumental in the introduction of the world’s first digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) and side stick controls in a commercial passenger aircraft with the A320 in 1988.

Ziegler’s career spanned some four decades. He realised the full potential that digital FBW could bring, including flight envelope protection incorporated into the control software. Ziegler's legacy lives on with digital FBW on all current generation Airbus aircraft, and its adoption as the standard on all modern passenger aircraft globally.

Born in 1933, in Boulogne sur Seine, Ziegler graduated from the French “Ecole Polytechnique” in 1954 and, later, from several engineering and flight training schools (Ecole Nationale de l’Air, Ecole de Chasse, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l’Aéronautique, Ecole du Personnel Navigant Essais). For ten years, he was a fighter pilot in the French Air Force.

During the early 1960s he studied aeronautical engineering at ENSA (l’Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l'Aéronautique) in Toulouse, which is now ISAE-SUPAERO. He then attended prestigious flight test pilot school EPNER, before taking up a career as a military test pilot.

Ziegler joined Airbus as its chief test pilot in 1972 and was given the task of setting up a new flight test division. He put together a team that shared the objectives of both the design office and the partner countries, fostering collaboration between flight test crews and design engineers.

As a test pilot, he flew the first flight of the first A300 in 1972. The programme was later on an early testbed for FBW which transfers the pilot’s commands to the aircraft via digital signals. FBW provides significant benefits through commonality, improved flight safety, reduced pilot workload, fewer mechanical parts, and real-time monitoring of all aircraft systems.

He also flew the A310, A320 and A340-200. In June 1993, Ziegler participated in the longest flight ever undertaken by a civil aircraft, when an A340-200, dubbed the “World Ranger”, flew around the world from Paris with just one stop in Auckland in just over 48 hours.

Up until his retirement in December 1997, Ziegler was Airbus Senior Vice President of Engineering.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9960416555404663}",neutral,0.9960416555404663,0
Airbus starts the structural assembly of its 1st A321XLR - Airbus,"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1zdGFydHMtdGhlLXN0cnVjdHVyYWwtYXNzZW1ibHktb2YtaXRzLTFzdC1hMzIxeGxy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A



irbus teams have reached a significant milestone in the making of the first A321XLR - production has started in Germany with the structural assembly of the Centre and Rear fuselages.

In May, Airbus’ manufacturing partner Premium AEROTEC delivered the first fully equipped Rear Centre Tank to Airbus’ major component assembly facility in Hamburg - a key component of the A321XLR’s performance. Heralding the start of the assembly of the aircraft’s rear fuselage and the centre fuselage in the dedicated “Structure Pilot Line”.

“It's a major milestone for the A321XLR programme. The teams can be proud of this achievement and the overall speed of industrialization. We are on track with our planning. The pilot line dedicated to the A321XLR is ready and waiting to operate the assembly phases for the first flight test aircraft, all the way through to the entry into service, ” said Martin Schnoor, Head of A321 XLR Programme Development Airframe Programme.



The Rear Centre Tank, the XLR performance masterpiece

The RCT, which is unique to the new long-range A321XLR, is a permanently installed high-capacity fuel tank that makes maximum volumetric use of the aircraft’s lower fuselage. Integrated in fuselage Sections 15 and 17 and located behind the main landing gear bay it holds up to 13,100 litres, which is more fuel than several Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs) combined could previously hold in the A321 aircraft Family.

Overcoming the covid challenges

The integration of the RCT represented a significant challenge for the teams to ensure the smooth integration of the new rear centre tank and its new fuel systems. Operations faced a very tight time schedule for the overall development and the industrial set-up. Around this time, the COVID-19 pandemic started to impact collaborative work on the XLR plateau. “It was yet another significant challenge, but we quickly adapted using digital means with a “co-design approach” to achieve a solution for the aircraft,” said Stephan Meyer, Head of A321XLR Industrial Centre Aft Fuselage. “We are proud of this great product, developed and industrialized under such difficult circumstances, which is well underway,” he concludes.

The assembly phases on the pilot line

In parallel to this, the structural assembly of Section 15 started in mid April with the integration of the shells from the supplier RUAG, the Centre Wing Box coming from Airbus Nantes, and the keel beam and Rear Flange Module supplied by Premium AEROTEC. All parts of the integral Rear Centre Tank coming harmoniously together.

These major sections are currently assembled on the new dedicated production line in Hangar 260 - a pilot line deliberately separated from the rest of the A320 line, to be able to start the ramp-up of the A321XLR’s fuselages without impacting Hamburg’s existing single-aisle production. The pilot line itself has been fully designed in 3D, allowing for smart integration of the A321XLR design data from the beginning. “The coherent 3D design enabled optimum development of the overall A321XLR’s industrial system,” explained Stephan. “In addition we were able to validate the design digitally taking account of ergonomics, operations and logistics beforehand,” he concludes.



Making it happen

In the coming weeks, the teams will finalize the integration of the RCT module into section 17, with the structural assembly of the second flight test aircraft. The equipment assembly phase of the first aircraft is planned in the autumn, followed by a dedicated period for flight test equipment installation.

The A321XLR is a further step in the evolution of the Airbus’ single-aisle family and has been designed to maximise overall commonality with the rest of the Family. While at the same time introducing minimal changes needed to give the aircraft an Xtra Long Range, increased revenue payload, and the best travel experience as a result of the Airspace cabin.



This aircraft will provide airlines with a range of up to 4,700nm and a 30% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft.

The entry into service is planned in 2023.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9936875700950623}",neutral,0.9936875700950623,0
Airbus tells suppliers to gear up for record production on bestselling jets - The Guardian,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL21heS8yNy9haXJidXMtdGVsbHMtc3VwcGxpZXJzLXRvLWdlYXItdXAtZm9yLXJlY29yZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9uLWJlc3RzZWxsaW5nLWpldHPSAXxodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS9tYXkvMjcvYWlyYnVzLXRlbGxzLXN1cHBsaWVycy10by1nZWFyLXVwLWZvci1yZWNvcmQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vbi1iZXN0c2VsbGluZy1qZXRz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has told suppliers it is planning for record production of its bestselling planes within two years in a sign of the manufacturer’s hopes for a belated but strong recovery for aviation from the coronavirus pandemic.

The European manufacturer said on Thursday it would increase production of A320 single-aisle aircraft to 45 per month by October, up from 40.

However, it said suppliers should be ready for a rate of 64 per month by the spring of 2023 for the A320, which is well suited to short-haul travel that is expected to bounce back the quickest. That would beat its previous highest rate target of 63, and would be followed by 70 per month at the start of 2024 and as high as 75 by 2025.

The aerospace industry has endured months of weak demand for planes during the pandemic as airline customers cut back on orders as their revenues dried up. Airbus and its US rival, Boeing, together cut tens of thousands of jobs worldwide as demand plummeted. Demand for Boeing planes was hit further by the crisis over its previously top-selling 737 Max, which was grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes caused by malfunctions.

There is still confusion over when people across the world will be allowed to travel for tourism purposes. Airline and holiday firm bosses on Wednesday attacked the UK government’s “utterly confusing” advice on foreign travel.

However, aerospace analysts have long expected demand for air travel – alongside the sector’s carbon emissions – to overtake pre-pandemic levels rapidly once vaccines start to diminish the risks of the coronavirus. In the long term, the growth of the middle class in Asia and Africa is expected to continue the structural growth in flight numbers.

“The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the Covid-19 crisis,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it.”

The steep 2020 production cuts at Airbus and Boeing rippled through the industry, with suppliers such as the UK’s Rolls-Royce, which makes and maintains engines, particularly badly hit. Airbus shares rose by 6% while Rolls-Royce shares gained 3% on Thursday morning.

Record Airbus sales would likely mean a correlated rise in total carbon dioxide emissions from its products, even as the efficiency of individual planes increases. In February, Airbus revealed that it expects planes sold during 2019 and 2020 to emit more than 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide during their lifetimes.

Airbus also plans to increase production of its small single-aisle A220 from five per month to six by early 2022, and 14 per month around 2025. The twin-aisle A350 will increase from five to six by autumn 2022, reflecting the slower expected recovery in long-haul travel.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9492202997207642}",positive,0.9492202997207642,1
Trans-Atlantic rivalry brews over Airbus A321 converted freighter - FreightWaves,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy90cmFucy1hdGxhbnRpYy1yaXZhbHJ5LWJyZXdzLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtY29udmVydGVkLWZyZWlnaHRlctIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy90cmFucy1hdGxhbnRpYy1yaXZhbHJ5LWJyZXdzLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtY29udmVydGVkLWZyZWlnaHRlci9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A second manufacturer is gearing up to produce Airbus A321 converted freighters in the U.S. this summer, taking on a European engineering firm that is gaining sales momentum eight months after entering the market in the single-aisle freighter segment where the Boeing 737-800 has a three-year head start.

The two companies will compete head-to-head as well as against the Boeing product. Aviation experts say the A321 is highly desirable for express delivery and regional air cargo operations.

On Thursday, Dublin-based leasing company GTLK Europe ordered four aircraft reconfigured to carry cargo on the main deck, Elbe Flugzeugwerke, the company doing the work, announced. EFW is scheduled to convert three of the aircraft this year and the fourth in 2022.

Dresden, Germany-based EFW, a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore’s ST Engineering, recently opened a second assembly line in China and said it plans to open another one in the U.S. this year. It has already delivered three of the aircraft — two to Titan Airways and one to Qantas Freight. The Qantas plane is hauling packages for Australia Post.

At least 17 A321 passenger-to-freighter conversions have been ordered by leasing companies Vallair, BBAM and GTLK so far.

321 Precision Conversions, a U.S. joint venture between Precision Aircraft Solutions and publicly listed leasor and air cargo carrier Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG), two weeks ago received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certification for its A321-200 design modification, marking the completion of a three-year development program.

ATSG subsidiary PEMCO, a conversion facility in Tampa, Florida, is starting up a production line and expects to begin work on its first A321 in June, Chief Executive Rich Corrado said Thursday in an earnings call with analysts.

Avocet Aviation in Sanford, Florida, will also be a designated conversion site, Zachary Young, director of sales for 321 PC confirmed.





Joint venture officials have previously indicated the customer for the first aircraft is Luxembourg-based aircraft leasing and services firm Vallair. Young said the PEMCO and Avocet facilities each have one A321 parked on site ready to be inducted for conversion in June.

ATSG will make money through 321 Precision Conversions selling the conversion kits and royalties for the supplemental type certificate, as well as PEMCO’s engineering work.

The company plans to procure A321s through its Cargo Aircraft Management arm, convert them itself at PEMCO and lease them to express carriers and other customers, such as Amazon Air (NASDAQ: AMZN) and DHL (DXE: DPW). The A321 will supplement the rental opportunities ATSG currently enjoys with Boeing 767 converted freighters. Its business model is to wrap services — crew operations, maintenance, ground handling — around leased aircraft for customers that want a turnkey product. Officials say the model diversifies the revenue stream and makes customers stickier than if they simply lease an asset.

The A321 presents a broader opportunity for ATSG because it shares in the supplemental type certificate and can also do the touch-labor conversion, which isn’t the case with the 767, Corrado explained at an investor conference in March. Israel Aircraft Industries does the 767 conversions for ATSG.

Narrow-body cargo jets are in high demand from express and postal operators contending with rising package volumes as e-commerce grows in popularity. Boeing (NYSE: BA) this week opened another production line to convert 737-800s in Costa Rica.

“The A321 is a fantastic airplane for express operators. It can compete with both the 737-800 and offers a great opportunity for replacement in the 757-200, which up until about a year and a half ago, was the most prolific express aircraft in the networks of the large FedEx, DHL express operators,” Corrado said.

The A321 converted freighter is the first in the narrow-body class to offer containerized loading on both the main and lower decks. It has a payload of about 61,800 pounds and a range of more than 2,300 nautical miles. The 737-800 can only fit loose cargo in the belly hold.

Aviation specialists expect plentiful supply of relatively new, affordable A321s to be available for conversion after airlines downsized in response to lower passenger demand and retired many of the aircraft sooner than planned, with many shifting to the newer, more fuel-efficient A320neo.





321 Precision Conversions and EFW have already been chirping at each other, with 321 PC saying its version features the lowest operating empty weight, more standard range and payload, better crew amenities, and a better cargo door design and cargo handling system. For its part, EFW claims it has an advantage in life-cycle value and maintenance because it is the original equipment manufacturer. It also contends it’s version has a better center-of-gravity and coverage for all weight variants of the A321.

Corrado said ATSG is negotiating to procure some A321s and hopes to convert three or four in 2022.

“We view the plane as a great replacement for the 757 as that plane gets up there in terms of age. Very efficient; we also think it’s a good upsell from the 737-800 and we think it’s a global airplane,” ATSG Chief Commercial Officer Mike Berger said at the investor presentation. “We think the airplane has application in the U.S. and North America, but very much so in Europe as well as Southeast Asia, India, etc. So the airplane can be utilized, based on the size of it, in a number of different ways as the market evolves and some other airplanes age.

“And certainly from a geographic standpoint it sets up very nicely to service markets across the globe,” he said.

China-based Sine Draco Aviation Technology is also developing an A321-200 passenger-to-freighter conversion program and could receive regulatory approval in the next year.

737-800 EU mod

Meanwhile, Miami-based Aeronautical Engineers Inc., announced Friday the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has signed off on its proprietary design for retrofitting the Boeing 737-800. The certification will allow AEI, which developed its own conversion kit separate from Boeing’s program, to convert aircraft for use in Europe.

AEI said it has received multiple expressions of interest for the 737-800 conversion from potential European customers.

The AEI converted 737-800 freighter offers a main deck payload of up to 52,700 pounds, with 11 full-height container positions plus room for a smaller container. Modifications include installation of a main cargo door, a cockpit barrier and reinforced floor beams.

Since November, AEI has secured 40 orders for the B737-800SF. AEI has 14 simultaneous freighter conversion production lines at licensed partners, nine of which are dedicated to the 737-800 freighter. The company said it is on track to deliver 24 various freighters in 2021 and more than 30 in 2022.

(Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said SmartLynx Airlines had received one A321 modified freighter. It hasn’t taken delivery of any aircraft yet. Titan Airways has two A321s, not one.)

Airbus said Thursday it will produce more single-aisle planes in 2023 than before the coronavirus crisis as the European aerospace giant sees the aviation sector ascending from the pandemic.

The aircraft maker had slowed its production early on in the pandemic last year as COVID-19 and border closures caused a massive drop in air traffic, severely denting the earnings of airlines.

""The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis,"" Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said in a statement.

The company said it expects the commercial aircraft market ""to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment"".

Airbus is ""therefore providing suppliers with an update of its production plans, giving visibility in order to schedule necessary investments and secure long term capacity and production rate readiness, in line with the expected recovery"", it said.

Airbus shares soared at the Paris stock exchange following the announcement.

Airbus is currently producing 40 planes of the A320 family per month but the company said it would increase the average rate to 45 during the last three months of this year.

It added that suppliers should ""prepare for the future by securing a firm rate"" of 64 A320 planes by the second quarter of 2023. The cadence will increase to 70 per month in 2024 and possibly 75 by 2025.

It is crucial for Airbus to unveil production plans early as making an aircraft involves a long supply chain to produce engine parts and assemble planes.

The company was producing 60 A320 planes per month before the pandemic and had planned to increase the rate to 63 in 2020 until COVID-19 changed those plans.

The aerospace firm also cut 15,000 jobs out of 135,000 posts, though the company avoided layoffs in France, Germany, Britain and Spain, its main locations.

The A320 jet is made at assembly lines in France, Germany, the United States and China.

Long-haul struggle

Airbus will also step up production of its smaller, single-aisle A220 plane, which is assembled in Mobile, Alabama, and Mirabel in Quebec.

The recovery of wider-bodied planes is less bright as long-haul flights have been the most affected by the pandemic.

Airbus said it would increase production of its A350 twin-aisle planes from five to six per month by autumn 2022 compared to 10 before the crisis.

A330 production will remain at two per month compared to three before the pandemic.

Airbus has posted profits for two consecutive quarters and expects to deliver 566 planes in 2021, the same as last year.

An Airbus achievement for IoT end-to-end solutions

Five Astrocast nanosatellites were successfully deployed in low-Earth orbit earlier this year and will be the first to deliver commercial services. They follow two precursor satellites launched in 2018 and 2019. Another set of five will be launched during this summer, after which Astrocast is aiming to launch 20 to 30 satellites annually.

""This is a critical milestone for both Astrocast and a long list of customers and partners,” said Fabien Jordan, Astrocast CEO. “With the Astrocast Network, our customers will have two-way communications with their IoT assets, even in some of the world's most remote and challenging regions. And these five satellites are just the beginning.""

This success marks Airbus' first commercial achievement in delivering IoT end-to-end solutions. Work started some years ago thanks to internal and collaborative R&D activities with the support of the French Government's General Directorate for Enterprise, along with public funding received through the Future Investments Programme.

Opening the way for UNIT commercial operations

François Gaullier, Head of Telecom Systems at Airbus Defence and Space, said: ""Airbus and its strategic partner Astrocast have co-developed and deployed a unique communications protocol optimised for global satellite IoT communications. We are very excited about the results of this collaboration, and for the future of this technology.”

Gaullier thanked the teams that made this success possible, opening the way to commercial operations of the UNIT solution. “This is a clear illustration of our capacity for perseverance and innovation. Congratulations!"" he added.

Following the effective deployment on low-Earth orbiting satellites, future studies and projects are considering the deployment of the UNIT solution over geostationary-orbit satellites, according to Gaullier.

“We are very excited about the results of this collaboration, and for the future of this technology.”

More flexibility for the A320 Family production system - Airbus,"Wed, 12 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LW1vcmUtZmxleGliaWxpdHktZm9yLXRoZS1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXN5c3RlbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its overall strategy to modernise and add flexibility to its single-aisle production system, Airbus continues to invest in next-generation industrial means in order to meet market demand and customer expectations. This includes more flexibility for the assembly of the market-leading A321neo.

Airbus continues to work on tomorrow’s industrial system

The A320neo Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle with over 15,500 aircraft sold to more than 320 customers, and over 5,650 in backlog. Within that family, the A321 - the long-range, high-capacity variant of the A320 - represents today over 50% of the total order backlog for this family of aircraft, with close to 3000 aircraft to be delivered over the coming years.

As the popular proverb goes: with great power comes great responsibility. In order to keep its production system at the forefront of new technologies and meet expectations of its customers for quality, competitiveness and on-time delivery, Airbus is constantly reviewing ways to modernise and improve its production system.

To date, Hamburg - a true single-aisle centre of gravity within Airbus, with four final assembly lines (FAL) for the A320 Family - as well as Mobile (Alabama) are the only sites in the Airbus production system ready to assemble the A321. This is why, in order to meet customer demand for this increasingly popular variant of the A320 Family, Airbus had decided in January 2020 to modernise its production system for single-aisle aircraft by transforming the former A380 Lagardère facility in Toulouse into a new-generation A320 Family FAL which would be capable of assembling A321s, therefore bringing more flexibility to Airbus’ global industrial set-up.

At the time, all potential Airbus sites were considered and assessed, and the choice of the best location for this new FAL was made based on many criteria. The objective was to ensure that this new site could be operational quickly enough to meet customer demand, to guarantee the highest levels of competitiveness and to minimise the levels of investment required to set up this new facility. Toulouse was eventually selected as the best site, notably because of the opportunity to re-use existing A380 facilities and because of its integration into the overall Airbus industrial flow.

Keeping the production system at the forefront of new technologies

But COVID-19 struck, and with it came the worst crisis the aviation industry had ever had to manage. Plans to overhaul the A320 production system in Toulouse were “hibernated”, and the immediate priority shifted to adapting production rates to the brutal drop in demand and reducing overall output by around 40%.

With market recovery now in sight and a potential return to pre-COVID single-aisle rates between 2023 and 2025, Airbus teams can focus again on the long-term and are reconnecting to earlier plans to establish this new A320 Family FAL in Toulouse. Earlier this year, a supplier was selected by Airbus to design and implement this new-generation FAL, which should be operational by end 2022 and which will replace one of the existing, original A320 FALs in Toulouse.

Leveraging best-in class digital technologies, tools and processes, this modernised FAL will complement Hamburg’s A321 capabilities and improve the working conditions, overall industrial flow, quality and competitiveness by adding a new-generation assembly line to the Airbus single-aisle production system. It will also support production flexibility for the next-generation A321XLR, first deliveries of which are expected to take place from 2023 in Hamburg - helping to meet customer requirements and make the best-selling single-aircraft family even better.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999909400939941}",positive,0.9999909400939941,1

Flight AF447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean during a storm on June 1, 2009, the deadliest crash in Air France's history.

With the decision the court followed the prosecutor's recommendation, overturning an earlier court decision to drop the case against the French flagship carrier and Europe's top aircraft maker.

Lawyers for Airbus immediately said that they would lodge an appeal.

It took two years to find the wreckage of the Airbus A330 jet, which was eventually located by remote-controlled submarines at a depth of 3,900 metres (13,000 feet).

Investigators determined the crash was caused by pilot errors, who were disorientated by faulty speed monitoring equipment.

The general prosecutor's office call for a manslaughter trial against both Air France and Airbus went beyond the Paris prosecutor's initial demand that only Air France face manslaughter charges.

Both prosecuting teams contested a 2019 decision to drop the charges by the two investigating magistrates assigned to the case, who said they could not ascribe fault to the companies in what appeared to be a case of pilot error.

But prosecutors accuse Air France of indirectly causing the tragedy by providing insufficient training on how to react in case of malfunction of the so-called Pitot tubes, which enable pilots to monitor their speed.

The pilots reacted incorrectly when the plane stalled after the speed sensors froze over.

The Paris appeals court decision was much awaited by victims' families.

""It's a huge satisfaction to feel that we have finally been heard by the courts,"" Daniele Lamy, president of an association of victims' families, said after Wednesday's ruling.

Since the disaster, pilot training on dealing with unforeseen circumstances has been stepped up in France and several other countries.

Airbus H145 helicopter joins Sûreté du Québec fleet - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWgxNDUtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1qb2lucy1zdXJldGUtZHUtcXVlYmVjLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On May 7, 2021, the Sûreté du Québec’s (Quebec Provincial Police’s) newly acquired Airbus H145 helicopter arrived at its operational base at Saint-Hubert Airport in its new official colors to enter into operational service in the coming weeks.

The Sûreté du Québec’s newly acquired H145 features Airbus’s Helionix avionics suite, four-axis autopilot, and a Fenestron tail rotor. Claude La Frenière Photo

Bearing the registration C-GSQP, and answering to air traffic control by call sign “QUEBEC 145,” it joins the two other helicopters in the Sûreté du Québec fleet: a Bell 206B JetRanger purchased in 1980 and a Bell 412 purchased in 2002. It replaces a Bell 206LT TwinRanger that the Sûreté du Québec had been using since 1994, which was destroyed in a severe but nonfatal accident during a search-and-rescue operation in January 2020.

The Government of Québec purchased the pre-owned H145 in August 2020 through the Service Aérien Gouvernemental (SAG, or Government Air Service), which manages all aircraft owned by the provincial government. Manufactured in 2016 and previously operated by Italy’s Elifriulia, the aircraft had accumulated only around 850 flight hours at the time of purchase.

The CDN$13 million acquisition was controversial, with some questioning why the government chose to buy an Airbus helicopter rather than one from Bell, which manufactures all of its commercial helicopters in Mirabel, Québec, near Montreal.

However, in a Sept. 16 article in Le Journal de Montréal, Quebec Ministry of Transport spokesperson Émilie Lord maintained that a pre-owned helicopter could be acquired and placed into service in the framework of a mutual agreement contract much more quickly than could a new aircraft, which would be subject to a full tender process.

The H145 is much larger and more powerful than the TwinRanger it replaces. That will allow it to fulfill a greater number of tasks for the Sûreté du Québec, which is responsible for missions including search-and-rescue, aerial surveillance, transport of SWAT and other teams, and other humanitarian and tactical operations across an area of more than 1.6 million square kilometers.

The aircraft was first delivered to Québec in December 2020 in its yellow Elifriulia paint scheme, at which point flight crews and maintenance technicians underwent a brief period of familiarization training. It was subsequently transferred to Airbus Helicopters Canada facilities in Fort Erie, Ontario, for upgrades specific to its new role.

The H145’s mission-specific equipment includes an external hoist, searchlight, and an augmented reality mapping system. The cockpit is compatible with night vision imaging systems (NVIS) to contribute to the helicopter’s operational flexibility. Its paint scheme features the new black-and-white Sûreté du Québec vehicle colors, while also integrating the agency’s heritage colors of khaki green and yellow.

A Sûreté du Québec spokesperson told Vertical by email on May 13 that “the helicopter is still in preparation by our members as to equipment gathering and installation on the new aircraft. During this time, officers and crewmembers are undergoing training with our new equipment.” The agency expects to do an official reveal of the H145 sometime around September, the spokesperson said.

The aircraft is the second H145 to be in service with a police force in Canada, joining one operated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police out of Vancouver, British Columbia.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999992847442627}",neutral,0.999992847442627,0
Airbus opens new H145 full-motion simulator in Texas - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1oMTQ1LWZ1bGwtbW90aW9uLXNpbXVsYXRvci1pbi10ZXhhcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has cut the ribbon on a new full-motion H145 simulator at its Grand Prairie, Texas, facility so that operators of the popular twin-engine aircraft from North and South America can train without having to travel to Europe.

Developed by Thales, the Level D H145 full-flight simulator opened May 10 in Grand Prairie, Texas, is the first outside Europe. Airbus Photo

The brand-new Thales Reality H full-motion flight simulator was inaugurated Monday at the Helisim Simulation Center, a $22 million facility offering pilots initial and recurrent training on the H145.

“With this brand-new, state-of-the-art H145 Level-D full flight simulator, our North American customers can experience the highest levels of H145 training in their own backyard,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters and head of the North America region.

Developed by Thales, the Level D H145 full-flight simulator is one of the most advanced simulators available, thanks to the integration of Airbus Helicopters’ avionics and software suite, a larger field of view, 4K projection technology, Thales’ electric Hexaline motion, and a new intuitive touchscreen instructor station. Considered a “zero-time” simulator, the experience replicates exactly the experience of flying the H145, allowing pilots to train right up to their initial check-out flight, Trapp said.

Airbus has sold 40 H145s and plans to sell up to 50 of the twin-engine helicopters a year for the foreseeable future. Because of the popularity of the aircraft, Airbus has “seen a significant increase in demand for simulation,” Trapp said.

The 18,500-square-foot Helisim Simulation Center was designed to house two simulator bays, with the possibility to expand to three simulators in the future as needed. Airbus Photo

More than 1,200 hours already are booked on the simulator by various operators in the helicopter EMS, oil-and-gas and law enforcement sectors, according to Trapp. Most of those customers are based in the U.S. and Canada. Others are from Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brazil, Jean-Charles de Troy, managing director of Helisim, told Vertical. The first trainee is scheduled to being in June.

“With this new training center, Helisim is able to offer the best simulator-based training to H145 operators,” de Troy said. “With outstanding equipment and software implemented, including an OEM simulator data package, along with integrating Airbus helicopter flight instructors, our goal is to offer a reliable and true-to-mission training experience to H145 pilots.”

Equipped with the OEM data package, the simulator provides the most true-to-life experience with the safety benefits of simulation, allowing instructors to train operators to react safely and efficiently to a wide variety of real-world situations.

“I was really, really impressed with how real the simulator is,” Trapp said of his experience flying it. “Usually when you go in a simulator, you know you are not in a real environment. The technology of this simulator makes you really feel you are in a helicopter and flying.”

The 18,500-square-foot Helisim Simulation Center was designed to house two simulator bays, with the room for expansion to three simulators in the future, as needed. The training center also operates an H125/AS350 full-flight simulator and an EC135/EC145 flight training device.

The simulator is set up to train pilots on the four-blade version of the H145 because that configuration is what the majority of operators fly. When the five-blade version of the aircraft overtakes the four-blade variant on the market, the simulator will be upgraded to train pilots on the five-blade version, de Troy said.

The new simulator represents a major international expansion of France-based Helisim, a joint venture of Airbus Helicopters, Thales, and DCI. Airbus trains about 1,500 pilots and technicians at its Grand Prairie facility each year, Trapp said. The simulator is Airbus Helicopters’ second H145 full flight simulator. The other is at Airbus headquarters in Germany.

The U.S. Army has purchased 18 H145s and will send some of its pilots to Grand Prairie for simulator training.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994818568229675}",neutral,0.9994818568229675,0

EASA certifies A330neo to ICAO's new CO2 emissions standard - Airbus,"Wed, 26 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LWVhc2EtY2VydGlmaWVzLWEzMzBuZW8tdG8taWNhb3MtbmV3LWNvMi1lbWlzc2lvbnMtc3RhbmRhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Cleaner & more efficient: the A330neo first to receive green-light for post-2028 environmental regulations

The A330-900 (Neo) has become the first large airliner to be certified by *EASA for *ICAO’s new CO 2 emissions standard. With this milestone, not only is Airbus the first manufacturer to receive such certification for any commercial aircraft world-wide, but this also demonstrates that the aircraft which Airbus produces today, and will continue to produce well into the future, will comply with foreseeable CO 2 regulations.

The new requirement, adopted in 2017, has been developed by the UN’s ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) and is now being cascaded to certifying airworthiness authorities worldwide. Moreover, it complements existing aircraft noise and engine emissions standards and will be applicable both to New Type-Certified aircraft and to In-Production aircraft. By January 2028 all aircraft being produced will need to comply with the ICAO CO 2 standard. Existing in-service aircraft, meanwhile, are being covered by separate environmental measures.

Simone Rauer, Airbus’ Head of Aviation Environmental Roadmap commented: “Airbus is proud to be the first commercial aircraft manufacturer to receive EASA certification for ICAO’s new CO 2 emissions requirement. ICAO standards are important elements of the global ICAO action plan to regulate emissions from aircraft and engines and to help ensure a level playing-field in the industry.” She adds: “For the A330neo in particular this award demonstrates that this aircraft meets ICAO’s environmental regulations beyond 2028.”

As ICAO released its recommendation to Member States, EASA was the first major certifying authority to implement the CO 2 standard in its certification requirements for commercial aircraft. Going forward, Airbus will learn from being the first manufacturer to apply this certification requirement and will contribute to improving and further developing the standards set by ICAO, and benefiting the entire industry. All the other Airbus airliner products will receive certification in due course in a timeframe consistent with the certification requirements, and will thus comply with the CO 2 requirements by the January 2028 deadline.



‘Technologically-encouraging’ and complementary to other ICAO and EASA environmental measures for aviation

Furthermore, ICAO standards such as this one are ‘technology-encouraging’ and are based on demonstrated and proven technologies which can be inserted into the next generation of aircraft. Moreover, this particular one is an important new ‘brick’ to complement a range of existing ICAO measures which help to control and curb the emissions which are attributed to civil aviation. Such other measures also include sustainable aviation fuels as well as market-based incentives including ICAO’s *CORSIA -- Annex 16 Volume 4 carbon offsetting mechanisms for operational CO 2 emissions etc.



It should be noted that only 12% of the world fleets today comprise the latest generation of aircraft, so there is still a great deal of CO 2 emissions reductions which can be achieved simply via large scale fleet renewals with new-generation aircraft like the A220, A320neo, A321neo, A330neo and A350 families.

The CO 2 certification of the current product lines (such as the Airbus aircraft types listed above, plus the latest aircraft from other OEMs) is foreseen to be one of the key pillars of the forthcoming EASA Environmental Label (encompassing in addition to CO 2 , noise and local emissions certification standards) in order to convey the environmental product performance of new-generation aircraft.

*Abbreviations:

EASA = European Union Aviation Safety Agency

ICAO = International Civil Aviation Organization

CORSIA = Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation

Background information:

The standard defines the certification of a CO 2 emissions Metric Value which needs to remain below a limit line function of the aircraft Maximum Take-Off Weight (pass/fail criterion). This Metric Value comprises two main components: a fuel burn component (called Specific Air Range or SAR) measured at three different masses during the cruise and then averaged; and a non-dimensional component (called Reference Geometric Factor or RGF) representing the cabin ‘useful’ surface from the cockpit door to the aft end of the pressurised area. The resulting CO 2 emissions Metric Value, expressed as kilogrammes of fuel per kilometre.

The following applicability dates have been defined:



1st of January 2020: New Types (for applications made to EASA after this date);

1st of January 2023: Derivative aircraft under certain conditions (for applications made to EASA after this date);

1st of January 2028: All In-Production aircraft.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7552176713943481}",positive,0.7552176713943481,1
What the blazes is LiFi and why does Airbus offer it? - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JsYXplcy1saWZpLWFpcmJ1cy1vZmZlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We’ve heard of Wi-Fi and Hi-Fi but what in blue blazes is LiFi?

It was a question raised by Airbus when it announced this week its corporate jets unit was the only manufacturer to offer “the next-generation communications technology onboard a corporate aircraft”.

It turns out it’s an in-flight entertainment (IFE) technology and Airbus has partnered with Latécoère Interconnection Systems (LIS) to develop a smart LiFi Monitor.

It turns out LiFi has been around since 2011 and it uses the modulation of light to transmit data and position between devices.

READ: Lufthansa bookings soar as Germany eases COVID restrictions.

It uses visible light as well as infrared and ultraviolet spectrums to transmit data at high speeds that could theoretically hit 100 Gigabits per second.

One of its advantages is the ability to safely function in areas otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference, such as aircraft cabins.

Airbus said the agreement with LCI made Airbus Corporate Jets the only aircraft manufacturer to offer the next generation of communication systems technology onboard a corporate aircraft.

The monitor is a multi-technology smart 4K unit that will also offer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

It has analog audio output with USB-C ports as well as HDMI connections and features audio-video on-demand, casting, mirroring, web browser, live TV and integrated video conferencing.

The manufacturer aims to make the new technology, which can also be upscaled, available for retrofit on the more than 200 Airbus corporate jets already flying and for cabin outfitting before the end of the year.

But it is not alone in looking at the technology’s potential: French company Oledcomm tested LIFi at the 2019 Paris Airshow and said at the time it hoped to collaborate with Air France on future testing.

In other ACJ news, the first section of the recently launched ACJ TwoTwenty arrived at the A220 Final Assembly Line in Mirabel, Canada, recently for the first Airbus corporate jet ever assembled in Canada.

The ACJ TwoTwenty was launched in late 2020 and has already won orders for six aircraft, with Comlux due to take the first delivery this northern winter as the exclusive outfitter for the first 15 aircraft.

Airbus says the bizjet will feature “unmatched personal space” with 73 sq. m. (785 sq.ft) of floor space and six, wide VIP living areas for up to 19 passengers.

It will have an intercontinental range, capable of flying up to 5,650 nm (10,500 km). or over 12 flight hours.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995513558387756}",neutral,0.9995513558387756,0

Airbus sees gap in widebody freighter market as Boeing is hit by new rules - theloadstar.com,"Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1zZWVzLWdhcC1pbi13aWRlYm9keS1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItbWFya2V0LWFzLWJvZWluZy1pcy1oaXQtYnktbmV3LXJ1bGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Alex Lennane 04/05/2021

Boeing has, almost uncontested, ruled the world of widebody freighters in recent years, but rival Airbus is finally stepping up.

And this is happening at a time when Boeing is at something of a disadvantage.

New CORSIA environmental rules mean that aircraft not meeting new standards can no longer be produced from 2028 – likely to impact manufacture of 777-300 and 767-200 freighters, according to one aircraft insider.

Boeing is, instead, planning a 777X freighter, but this remains at the discussion phase, following an expression of interest from Qatar Airways.

But it leaves a gap in the market – and Airbus is keen to step in.

Chief executive Guillaume Faury said, at last week’s financial results announcement, Boeing had enjoyed “almost exclusivity” in the “important” widebody freighter segment and Airbus was watching “carefully”.

He added: “We don’t like the idea that we are not active in that segment.”

Mr Faury said Airbus was examining the market potential and that the A350 would be a strong candidate for a “good freighter version”. But he also said, rather cryptically, “the decision is made that there is no decision”.

However, one source close to freighter airlines said Airbus was already touting the A350-1000 variant as a freighter at a price of $170m (“not a bad price,” commented the source), potentially from 2025, at least two years before Boeing’s proposed new offering.

“There is a good chance that combination airlines already operating the A350 will be interested, such as Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa,” added the source. “There is not enough lift to meet demand, and airplanes keep retiring and so on. The market will be tight and Airbus has seen an opportunity.”

He said there would be “a lot of engineering work to be done” on the A350-1000F – “Airbus will need some orders first.”

The news follows Airbus’s latest attempt to capture some of the current zeitgeist of cargo-only passenger aircraft. Last week, Airbus and Lufthansa Technik signed a cooperation agreement to develop temporary cabin solutions for A330s, said to be the second-best aircraft type for cargo-only operations.

Lufthansa Technik will own the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), which will enable operators to load cargo into the cabins of their A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft. Lufthansa will provide modification kits, Airbus technical data, engineering validations and operational calculations. The solution will see the seats removed for standard PKC pallets and nets.

This solution offers cargo capacity of about 78 cu metres on the main deck of an A330-200, with 12 PKC pallet positions and 18 nets, while the A330-300’s main deck cargo capacity will be around 86 cu metres, with 15 PKC pallet positions and 19 nets.

“In these times of reduced passenger traffic, our customers are looking for quick solutions to temporarily increase cargo transport capacity in the cabin,” said Daniel Wenninger, head of airframe services at Airbus.

Meanwhile, ACMI specialist SmartLynx said yesterday the A321 conversion programme led to lower fuel and operational costs than Boeing’s rival, the 757. SmartLynx has two aircraft which have been converted, with another eight planned.

“There are many advantages to the Airbus A321 aircraft, especially in the freight field,” said CEO Zygimantas Surintas. “The A321 aircraft’s fuel burn is the lowest in class – a massive 20% lower than the 757 – and the direct operational costs are significantly lower. These are key numbers that allow companies save substantial amounts.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983627200126648}",neutral,0.9983627200126648,0

Toulouse, 20 May 2021 – Today, Airbus released a first collection of sharp images at 30cm native resolution from the Pléiades Neo 3 satellite, recently safely launched and secured in orbit. The successful acquisitions and delivery of these first images are the start of a new era for both commercial and government geospatial applications requiring a high level of accuracy and the ability to see fine details.

The Pléiades Neo 3 images, covering a variety of global locations and featuring diverse acquisition angles, provide an impressive level of detail. In one it is easy to count each and every limestone block of the Giza Pyramids, and even the number of people visiting. The multi-layered construction of Castel Sant'Angelo across the years can also be seen in detail in another. Urban areas and modern architecture, and their comprehensive diversity, are clearly visible in the images over Shanghai, Dubai and Washington DC.

These already very sharp images were acquired before full radiometric and system calibrations and the quality will continue to improve over the next few months. Imagery from Pléiades Neo 3 is expected to become commercially available in the third quarter 2021, after these calibration steps are completed.

With the full capacity of the satellite available for commercial use, the very high-resolution and geometrically consistent Pléiades Neo 3 imagery will provide analysts with a high level of detail, including more visibility of small objects, such as vehicles and road markings. This level of detection, recognition and identification of objects provides more ground truth for image analysts and improves reliability for machine learning capabilities. The new constellation will also provide a higher geolocation accuracy and deeper spectral band information, allowing more insights to be derived for various applications.

The Pléiades Neo constellation will be comprised of four identical and very agile satellites, offering reactive tasking and intraday revisit of any point on Earth. Entirely funded, designed, manufactured, owned and operated by Airbus, each satellite will add half a million km² per day at 30cm native resolution.

The next milestone of the Pléiades Neo programme is the launch of Pléiades Neo 4, which is already at the launch site in Kourou, French Guiana. It is expected to launch in summer 2021, followed by the launch of Pléiades Neo 5 and 6, in 2022.

Airbus completes A330 MRTT automated tanking trial - Skies Magazine,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1hMzMwLW1ydHQtYXV0b21hdGVkLXRhbmtpbmctdHJpYWwv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtY29tcGxldGVzLWEzMzAtbXJ0dC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtdGFua2luZy10cmlhbC8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | May 25, 2021 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 5 minutes, 10 seconds.

Airbus has completed the trial of an automated aerial refuelling system, the company reported on May 20.

The test was conducted earlier this spring between an A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) tanker fitted with Airbus’s fully automated aerial refuelling system, called A3R, and aircraft from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).

The trials in early 2021 marked participation of an A3R-equipped RSAF A330 MRTT acting as tanker, and several receivers from the RSAF, including another A330 MRTT and fighter aircraft like the F-16 and F-15SG. MINDEF Photo

Airbus has been developing a way to reduce operator workload, improve safety and transfer fuel faster and more effectively through “push of a button” system for a number of years under SMART MRTT, a program to introduce advanced technological solutions such as enhanced maintenance on the multi-role aircraft.

The company first unveiled the A3R concept in 2018 and later that year conducted seven automatic contacts between an Airbus A310 development tanker and a Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft.

That was followed in 2020 by a demonstration of a fully automatic refuelling operation with a boom system involving an Airbus A310 tanker testbed aircraft and an F-16 fighter jet from the Portuguese Air Force acting as a receiver.

The recent trial with the RSAF and Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency was the first participation of an A3R-equipped RSAF A330 MRTT and several receiving aircraft, including a second A330 MRTT and F-16 and F-15 fighter jets. In total, the aircraft completed 88 fully automated dry and wet contacts and transferred nearly 30 tonnes of fuel.

“We had the opportunity to test our system with different receiver types ensuring the right fit of our systems, while gathering extensive data key to completing the A3R development,” said Luis Miguel Hernández, Airbus SMART MRTT manager. “The team were able to test the limits of the system successfully, verifying its robustness and ability to automatically track receivers with varying configurations.”

With the development phase complete, the company is now gearing up for “readiness of the final A3R version and preparation for a very demanding roadmap that will lead to certification by the end of 2021,” the company said in a press release.

The Airbus A330 MRTT is the only qualified bidder at present to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force CC-150 Polaris. The aircraft was selected in April following an invitation to qualify (ITQ) request by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) for the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC) project.

PSPC received two responses to the ITQ but would only name the successful respondent. Boeing, however, confirmed its submission, the KC-46 Pegasus, a militarized variant of the 767 widebody, had failed to qualify.

The RCAF is seeking a multi-role platform that can be configured for air-to-air refueling, personnel airlift, strategic government transport, aeromedical evacuations, and freight movement, among other roles. The aircraft may also be used to support disaster relief, search-and-rescue, and contributions to peace operations; it must also include the capacity to detect, avoid, and defeat air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. In its tanker role, the aircraft must be able to refuel allied fighter jets on NATO and NORAD operations.

The current fleet of CC-150s, a modified variant of the Airbus A310-300, were acquired in 1992 from Canadian Airlines, and two were converted to tankers in 2008. The fleet is operated by 437 Transport Squadron at 8 Wing Trenton, Ontario.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994609951972961}",neutral,0.9994609951972961,0

One United Family

This week, the Airspace Customer Showroom (ACS) situated in Toulouse, France unveiled its latest A220 full size mock-up, showcasing Airbus’ cabin expertise inside this unique customer showroom.

""Today marks an important development in the ongoing career of the A220 as a member of the Airbus family, altogether in the Airspace Customer Showroom. We are looking forward to showing the A220 mockup to our customers who are already extremely enthusiastic to visit,” said Christine de Gagné, Airline Marketing Director.



Moving forward

Seven years after its maiden flight, the first flight test vehicle ""FTV1"" has been rehabilitated by Airbus teams to become part of an iconic showcase; celebrating the successes of the A220 as part of the family. ""FTV1"" was the very first aircraft assembled in Mirabel between 2012-2013 and released into service after some 760 flight hours on the clock, opening another historic chapter for this aircraft.





The layout of the mock-up

The interior layout of the A220 cabin was an exciting challenge for the Airbus teams to make it alluring for customers. ""In a ground mock-up, the cabin interior must be adaptive and versatile. We need to think about the cabin configuration features, such as light and ambience, enabling customers to experiment with different inspiring scenarios for passengers"" explains Christine.

The mock-up will also be of great importance to both customers who have already selected the A220 and for Airbus teams dedicated to customizing the cabin. Airlines who are in the final configuration phase of their aircraft, will be able to test their lighting and seat selection in the mock-up before the delivery of their aircraft.



Innovative cabin design - for a feeling of space and superior passenger comfort



Ready to welcome customers

Fully operational, the A220 mock-up will be able to benefit from the expertise of the Airspace Customer Showroom to support the airline's needs. Every year, the facility hosts around 1000 visits - an average of 250 meetings with airlines, providing a powerful tool to assist customers, accelerate decision-making and demonstrate cabin innovations offered by the A220 within the Airbus family.

"Airbus A220 – Profitable For Airlines, But Not Airbus? - Mentour Pilot","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTIyMC1wcm9maXRhYmxlLWZvci1haXJsaW5lcy1idXQtbm90LWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | May 11, 2021

The much-celebrated efficiency of the A220 makes it profitable for its airline customers, but Airbus still finds it too expensive to make! And now they’re doing something about it.

Airbus is putting a supply chain company expert in charge of the A220 programme, in order to make it profitable to make. Benoit Schultz will take up this new role from September. He is currently a senior vice president in the Airbus procurement office. In plain English, he is in charge of the Airbus department that oversees suppliers for the entire group! He will succeed Philippe Balducchi, who got in charge of the CSeries at the time of its ‘transformation’ into the A220.

So, what does this actually mean? In simple terms, it means that Airbus has inherited the good and the bad, with the CSeries/A220. On the one hand, they got a very efficient, up-to-date and highly desirable aircraft, that airlines really want. But this was also the plane that Bombardier struggled so much to design and put together. The struggles they had then, are still part of why the A220 is still not profitable enough for Airbus.

In a recent article, we saw that COMAC’s C919 doesn’t benefit substantially from cheaper labour. This is because around 85% of an aircraft’s cost is in supplier-furnished components. So lower labour costs could save a bit, in the remaining 15%… and no more. In the case of the Airbus A220, for the plane to be profitable, it must get parts from suppliers at the right price. An Airbus price…

Making the Airbus A220 More Profitable

According to Reuters, Airbus have been looking for cuts of 20% from suppliers of major A220 components, in a drive to make the jet more profitable. They have already succeeded in the case of major suppliers like Raytheon Technologies, and Spirit Aero Systems.

Raytheon directly supplies a lot of the avionics of the aircraft. Raytheon also owns Pratt & Whitney, exclusive supplier of the A220’s GTF engines. Spirit makes the engine pylons, wing-to-fuselage fairings, the aft fairing package of the aircraft and various systems. However, Airbus has not been able to make the A220 more profitable in the case of many other parts and subsystems.

The manufacturer now has to decide if they should continue negotiations with other partners. Alternatively, they could overhaul the supply chain, or even redesign parts of the aircraft. However this would require investment and time.

Profitable or not, the Canadian-designed A220 numbers more net orders this year than any ‘European’ Airbus model! This suggests that the manufacturer could decide to invest on some changes. However the timing of the pandemic limits available funds for such a project.

All of this is another example of how brutally important scale can be, in the aviation world. The likes of Embraer, Bombardier and even Mitsubishi (for the troubled MRJ) don’t have as easy a time getting agreements with suppliers, as Airbus and Boeing do.

People recognize that marketing (i.e. a big name) can help sell planes. But we often forget that the same applies on the supply side as well!","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8886082172393799}",positive,0.8886082172393799,1
Will OEM Vertical Integration Die Off Or Expand After COVID-19? - Aviation Week,"Thu, 06 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvcHJvZ3JhbS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L3dpbGwtb2VtLXZlcnRpY2FsLWludGVncmF0aW9uLWRpZS1vci1leHBhbmQtYWZ0ZXItY292aWQtMTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Before COVID-19 turned the aerospace and defense (A&D) manufacturing and aftermarket worlds on their heads, a key issue clouding suppliers’ outlooks was how much encroachment to expect from Airbus, Boeing and Tier 1s looking to elbow into their markets.

Boeing, especially, was pursuing vertical integration aggressively, having declared new core business sectors in avionics, auxiliary power units and flight controls, as well as issuing eye-watering corporate goals such as achieving $50 billion in revenue from its new Boeing Global Services as soon as next year.

Expect more vertical integration from newer faces

Airbus retains aerostructures divisions

What now in the post-pandemic world? During several recent trade shows, webinars and Aviation Week interviews, advisors and analysts have shed light on where they think industry giants are going next and why. The takeaway: Expect more vertical integration from newer faces and less from past performers.

“Boeing is going to recalibrate its whole vertical integration strategy,” said Kevin Michaels of AeroDynamic Advisory recently. “The pendulum has probably swung too far.”

Boeing’s vertical integration strategy emanated from a 15-year “supercycle” of rising production rates and supply-chain bottlenecks, as well as envy over higher supply-chain operating margins. In that extraordinary era—double the average commercial aerospace business cycle—vertical integration made sense.

But that is not the world as we know it today. “We’re in this period now of abundance of capacity and resources rather than scarcity,” Michaels told Aviation Week. “Boeing has to revisit these and scale back in many areas.”

Some just seem off limits. In terms of the next Boeing aircraft, it is hard to see the company doing better than aerostructures leader Spirit AeroSystems is doing, particularly as Spirit has bolstered its business model recently with diversification and the acquisition of the former Short Brothers assets from Bombardier. Boeing would need to make serious investments to match Spirit, unlikely since Boeing has more than $40 billion in net debt.

Still, Michaels does not believe Boeing will unwind all vertical integration. For example, the insourcing of aftermarket distribution, such as through the KLX Aerospace acquisition, was a good move, he said. But application of the strategy will be far more discrete. “It’s a mixed message, but they definitely have to back off of it,” he said.

Indeed, the discrete approach could be playing out at Airbus, which did not pursue vertical integration nearly as much as Boeing before COVID-19. But Airbus may do more now.

When Airbus last year terminated plans to vertically integrate on the A320neo-bound Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan nacelle, many observers took it as a clear sign the tide had turned on vertical integration strategies. But in recent announcements, Airbus has brushed back those expectations by declaring aerostructures a core function after having tried to sell off its related assets for years (AW&ST May 3-16, p. 19).

Not only will Premium Aerotec and Stelia Aerospace not be sold, they will be reorganized into wholly owned Airbus companies. A third company is planned to focus on detailed parts.

Richard Apps of Counterpoint Market Intelligence follows the logic. “I take Airbus at their word,” he said. Aerostructures can be core in a post-pandemic world of greater environmental priorities and more efficient aircraft.

Some observers see confirmation in Boeing’s recent comments. CEO Dave Calhoun has said aircraft design will be more important to new airliner offerings going forward. The aircraft-maker will not just rely on powerplant improvements, as was done in the past.

Still, not everyone is convinced. “When Airbus said it was keeping aerostructures, I was wondering if that was code for, ‘We were unable to sell,’” Michaels said. “This is much more about preserving the European supply chain that Airbus and others worked 50 years to create than preserving ‘core’ capabilities, in my opinion. Wings are core to aircraft OEMs, but not fuselages.”

Regardless, winds are shifting within several trends in manufacturing, and that will prompt reactions from different players, said David Stewart of Oliver Wyman. Key differences in the post-pandemic world will include moving to “heavy insourcing” from “heavy outsourcing” before COVID-19, or generally a shift from “buy” to “make.”

Part and parcel will be shifts to diversified offerings from manufacturers focusing on product specialization, as well as suppliers moving to business models that stress intellectual property and agile manufacturing rather than simple build-to-print operations. Cost structures will shift to “best-cost” models that mitigate risks rather than “low cost at any cost.”

“They need to focus on core business and production, and some of these proposals they were putting into the marketplace were quite capital-intensive,” Stewart said of commercial OEM drives for vertical integration before the pandemic.

At the same time, for top-tier companies that enjoy good financing, the next few years may offer unparalleled opportunities to scoop up assets that backfill internal gaps or diversify revenue streams, as the commercial aerospace sector is expected to face a capital crunch from debt overhang due to the pandemic and the demand to invest for rising production rates.

Other A&D players see the benefits of more integration. Raytheon Technologies, which spans almost all corners of the market, was formed a year ago as part of a response to bulk up in response to Boeing’s commercial vertical integration and flattening defense budget outlooks. Lockheed Martin is trying to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne, a key rocket and missile propulsion provider. And Northrop Grumman bought Aerojet rival Orbital ATK in 2018.

“Contractors across the board may become alarmed that a number of programs will fall, driving a wave of vertical integration in order to strengthen capabilities,” defense industry advisor Jim McAleese said.

In a nutshell, vertical integration at the top of the industry is not only likely to stay, but it could pick up pace in some sectors where it was less evident. Expect more judicious application from those that are engaging in it, however.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9627841114997864}",neutral,0.9627841114997864,0
Airbus resumes Toulouse A320 family upgrades - PaxEx.Aero,"Wed, 12 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtYTMyMS1mYWwtdG91bG91c2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A321 will be assembled in Toulouse by the end of 2022 as Airbus resumes plans to update its final assembly lines in France (Image via Airbus)

Airbus is confident that demand for its single-aisle family of planes will return in the near future. To help meet that demand the company announced this week that it is resuming work to modernize the A320 family final assembly line facility in Toulouse. The updated, digitally-enabled A320/A321 final assembly line (FAL) will replace one of the original Toulouse A320 lines.

The company initially announced plans to convert the former A380 production space to an A321-capable line in January 2020. That effort was quickly suspended as the COVID-19 pandemic shook the global economy to its core. With a recovery on the horizon, however, Airbus decided to move forward with the efforts. The company now expects the line to be operational by the end of 2022.

Airbus believes a “market recovery [is] in sight” and sees a “potential return to pre-COVID production rates for single-aisle aircraft between 2023 and 2025.” This aligns with reports earlier this week that the company was asking suppliers to be ready to support an 18% increase in A320-family output by the end of 2022.

Wings both on and off the A320s on the FAL in Hamburg-Finkenwerder

Airbus currently produces 40 aircraft per month on these lines. The company delivered 34 A320 family planes to customers in April 2021.

Production is expected to rise to 45 by the end of 2021 and then to 53 the following year. The company previously peaked at 60 frames produced per month in 2020, with intentions to reach 63.

Expanding A321 options

Currently only the Finkenwerder (Hamburg) and Mobile, Alabama sites offer capacity for completion of A321s. As single-aisle demand generally trends towards larger aircraft the option to add a third location is a key part of Airbus’s strategy. The company expects the upgraded facility will “improve the working conditions, the overall industrial flow as well as the quality and competitiveness.”

Hamburg will retain one bit of exclusivity, at least for now. The A321XLR is expected to enter service in 2023, with production handled exclusively at the German site. One factor contributing to that assembly location is the integrated rear center fuel tank. That tank is produced by Premium AEROTEC, an Airbus subsidiary based in Augsburg, Germany.

The first tank-integrated fuselage section was delivered to the Finkenwerder line last week, 10 months after the initial metal was cut.

Launch customer jetBlue has now received its first aircraft - with a lot of technology and components from Diehl Aviation on board.

Diehl Aviation has developed comprehensive packages for the new Airspace cabin for the A320neo Family on behalf of its customer Airbus. The new cabin design offers passengers more seating comfort and largest luggage compartments. Diehl Aviation has adapted, among other things, the cabin's lining and designed a completely new lighting concept in addition to virtually touchless lavatories.

Diehl Aviation's Airspace cabin work packages for Single Aisle help to set new standards for aircraft cabins and consider passengers' growing needs for more space, comfort and maximum hygiene. This is especially effective on longer flight routes and significantly increases passengers' travel comfort.

Even the cabin entrance itself offers a unique welcome experience: Effect lighting equipped with the latest LED technology gives the entrance area an even larger, more modern and brighter feel. This impression extends to the entire cabin and is achieved by the stunning main lighting, the 40-centimeter-wide Hero Light running centrally, and the flexible light strips on the contour strips – for instance of the luggage compartments. The special feature here is that Hero Light can be customized to match the corporate identity of each airline with its own logo and patterns. This lends each aircraft its own individual touch. Comforting colors and dimmable lighting ensure maximum well-being for passengers on board.

To even enhance passenger comfort, the Sidewall Lining has also been completely modernized. The new sidewall contour even ensures an increased shoulder room.

Passengers will also find maximum comfort, a pleasant feel-good atmosphere and the highest hygiene and safety standards in the lavatories. Virtually touch-free on-board toilets feature automatic mood lighting, aroma dispenser, music, sensor-controlled faucets, touchless toilet lids and waste bin flaps, and antimicrobial surfaces throughout. Multiple sensors on the new lavatories provide optimized smoke and fire detection.

With its contributions for Airspace cabin Diehl Aviation is a strong partner on the way to the cabin of the future: This outstanding concept enables airline customers to offer their passengers an unique flight experience and to save costs. All this is possible, among other things, due to the implementation of the latest LED technology and the development of maintenance-friendly sidewalls.

By installation the G500 TXi, the analog devices were able to removed from the instrument panel, allowing for the complete digitalization of the cockpit.

Since the G500 TXi provides all flight-relevant data, it was necessary to install a back-up system in order to be able to operate the helicopter safely in case of system failure. The ESI-500 was selected for this purpose, which is also recommended by the manufacturer.

The ESI-500 mirrors the G500 TXi PFD data and displays airspeed, altitude, attitude and slip data. The unit is equipped with an internal battery and continues to indicate uninterrupted PFD information in the event of a system failure. The ESI-500 was installed above the Garmin G500 TXi and allows the pilot to give the pilot a good view to the device during operation.

“The installation of the ESI-500 has created the redundancy of the systems and ensured the flight safety of the pilots,” said Melisa Kir, design engineer for avionics at SPAES GmbH & Co. KG.

The required minor change for the installation of the ESI-500 in the H125 was carried out in SPAES’s own EASA Part 21J organization. The ESI-500 was installed in the customer’s own part 145.

Probably one of the longest ongoing rivalries in the aviation market is the one between two aircraft manufacturing giants - Airbus and Boeing. For years the companies had been head to head, trying to outsmart the other and take over the lucrative market. And while for many years world’s oldest aircraft manufacturer Boeing was on top, in 2019 Airbus displaced Boeing as the largest aerospace company by revenue. But what about their performance in the cargo area?

Currently, Airbus A321 and Boeing 757 are competing or the best middle of the market aircraft champion title. While superior in many areas, Airbus A321 could not take Boeing 757 in one area – cargo. But the tide has shifted in 2015, when the European manufacturer announced their conversion program during the Paris Air Show, for both the A320 and the A321 models, making them ideal candidates to replace the aging 757 freighters.

“There are many advantages to the Airbus A321 aircraft, especially in the freight field,” said Zygimantas Surintas, CEO from Smartlynx, a Latvia-based Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance (ACMI) company. “Currently we have two aircraft that went through the conversion program and by 2023 we plan to add eight more aircraft to our freight operations.”

According to Zygimantas Surintas, the main advantages are the lesser fuel consumption and lower operational costs when compared to Boeing 757. “The A321 aircraft’s fuel burn is the lowest in class – massive 20% lower than the 757 model and the direct operational costs are significantly lower. These are key numbers that allow companies save substantial amounts.”

Significantly lower fuel consumption is not only a cost efficient but also eco-friendly. As the A321 burns less fuel, the emissions are also lowered. “Companies are in constant search of possibilities to reduce their carbon footprint and invest into green initiatives”, said Smartlynx CEO. “Many are thinking of changing their old polluting aircraft with newer, more efficient models. “

A320/A321P2F are the only Single Aisle freighters that accommodate containers or pallets on both decks, allowing for more useable volume, increased payload capability, better interlining capability and turnaround times, as well as more flexibility. The A321 aircraft allows to carry live animals, cars, aircraft engines, etc. – cargo that was previously transported only via wide-body aircraft.

The wide communality of A321 aircraft means that there is a large pool of qualified staff that is especially important in cargo ACMI operations. “There are many great specialists very familiar with the A321 aircraft, able to work or support its operations. Synergy with the existing ACMI business allows for smooth cargo ACMI business integration,” explained Zygimantas Surintas.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9993605017662048}",positive,0.9993605017662048,1

Airbus takes Sentinel-1 data from orbit to Earth…and into the cloud - Airbus,"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LWFpcmJ1cy10YWtlcy1zZW50aW5lbC0xLWRhdGEtZnJvbS1vcmJpdC10by1lYXJ0aGFuZC1pbnRvLXRoZS1jbG91ZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The two Sentinel-1 satellites that orbit the Earth are generating vast amounts of imagery with C-band radars – delivering trillions of data bytes every month.

After their launches in 2014 and 2016, these spacecraft – which are equipped with Airbus-built synthetic aperture radar instruments – have provided users with imaging data for such applications as environmental monitoring, understanding the effects of climate change, and safeguarding everyday lives.

As manufacturer and operator of the Sentinel-1 data segment for the European Space Agency (ESA), Airbus was asked by ESA to carry on the success story and look at digitalising this vital asset after six years of outstanding performance since launch of the first Sentinel-1.

Under the Copernicus Earth Observation programme (a joint initiative of the European Commission and the European Space Agency), ESA requested transfer of operations of the Copernicus Sentinels’ data segment to commercial cloud environments. Airbus therefore set about developing a highly capable cloud-native solution and smoothly migrated the Sentinel-1 operations to a commercial cloud while continuing to deliver higher levels of operational performance.

Replacing the standard ground-segment infrastructure

Until recently, the enormous amount of data transmitted by Sentinel-1 satellites have been housed in a physical ground-based infrastructure that required relatively complex accessibility for users through Unix-based computer operating systems. This changed recently when Airbus completed a highly successful migration of the data segment to the commercial cloud – with the radar imaging data now available through much simplified internet-type connectivity and an easy-to-use graphic-rich dashboard.

Emmanuel Lebret, the Airbus project manager, said the Sentinel-1 data migration was handled in less than two years without technical glitches, and performed at a very competitive cost.

This experience positions Airbus for future data migration opportunities to the cloud, including missions beyond Sentinel-1 within the framework of Europe’s ambitious Copernicus programme, as well for as satellite imaging systems acquired by other customers.

A highly valued migration solution by Airbus

Key elements of the Airbus-managed migration were its development utilising 100% open-source cloud-based components (avoiding possible intellectual property rights issues), and the cloud-native solution with a micro-service architecture (which maximises the cloud’s benefits in terms of scalability and performance).

Lebret added that Airbus achieved its goals of maintaining the performance, reliability and agility levels of storage systems on the ground while enabling the customer to benefit from cost reductions that come with cloud-based storage – all while maintaining service levels so the transfer was transparent to users.

Another advantage is the ability to easily operate and monitor the cloud system via the internet with proper levels of security – and facilitating the access so that even a smartphone can be used.

“Our Sentinel-1 data segment migration to the cloud was very smooth…and there were no interruptions of service.”

Airbus project manager Emmanuel Lebret

The data segment’s migration – which is part of the Copernicus Ground System Transformation Programme – was managed in a design-to-cost approach through modelling for cost estimations, technical trade-offs and a balancing between timely performance and costs. This reflected the Airbus operations team’s customer-oriented approach, and its focus on end-user satisfaction, according to Lebret.

Additionally, the Sentinel-1 migration solution is “cloud agnostic” – enabling its deployment by any cloud provider, thereby preventing potential “lock-ins” by commercial cloud services suppliers.

“This has been a major achievement, and it represents a turning point in transforming the Copernicus Space Component’s operations…”

Betlem Rosich, ESA’s Copernicus Ground Segment Operations Manager

Betlem Rosich, ESA’s Copernicus Ground Segment Operations Manager, commended Airbus for developing a high-performance cloud-native solution and efficiently migrating Sentinel-1 operations to a commercial cloud – all while continuing to deliver excellent levels of operational performance.

“This has been a major achievement, and it represents a turning point in transforming the Copernicus Space Component’s operations towards a more adaptative, scalable, modular and cost-effective service-based operations architecture,” she said.

Ready for future scale-ups of the cloud infrastructure

With the Sentinel-1 data segment now in the cloud, its resources will enable scale-ups to meet the very significant increases in Copernicus data expected in the coming years – avoiding the need for future investments in hardware-based infrastructure that would become obsolete every several years.

The pair of Sentinel-1 satellites (designated Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) circle the Earth in the same orbital plane, positioned 180-degrees apart to provide coverage of the globe every six days. Their radar instruments are capable of penetrating clouds and acquiring data both in daylight and at night.

There are broad applications for Sentinel-1 data, from observations of sea ice zones, the arctic environment and maritime surveillance to the tracking of land surface motion (landslides, volcanoes, tectonics, etc.); risk management in flooding and other situations; support to emergency/humanitarian services; and the mapping of forests, water and agriculture.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9708573818206787}",positive,0.9708573818206787,1

Friedrichshafen, 25 May 2021 - It is six metres high, more than three metres wide, and weighs just over a tonne, and it forms the backbone of the new, second generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites. The structure for the first ""B"" satellite of the MetOp Second Generation (MetOp-SG) series has arrived at Airbus’ satellite integration centre in Friedrichshafen (Germany). By November 2022, the satellite should be ready to be delivered for its environmental test campaign during which it will be verified under space-like conditions.



The MetOp-SG programme is being implemented by the European Space Agency in collaboration with EUMETSAT. The MetOp-SG satellite fleet consists of six satellites and will secure the continuation of meteorological observations from a polar orbit in the 2024-2045 timeframe. Comprehensive data from the suite of innovative European instruments will feed into forecasting models bringing observations to a new standard.



Numerical weather prediction at regional and global levels will benefit from the satellite programme. MetOp-SG will provide enhanced infrared, microwave, and radio-occultation soundings of temperature and humidity; polar atmospheric motion vectors extracted from optical imagery; novel precipitation and cloud measurements from imagers in the optical, sub-millimetre and microwave spectra; and high-resolution ocean surface wind-vector and soil moisture measurements extracted from scatterometer observations.

MetOp-SG comprises two series of satellites, with three units in each series. The Satellite A series carries optical instruments and atmospheric sounders, while the Satellite B series accommodates microwave instruments. Both types are based on Airbus Defence and Space’s Astrobus high-power satellite platforms. While the Satellite A series is being developed and built under the industrial lead of Airbus in Toulouse (France), the design and manufacture of the Satellite B series is led by the company’s Friedrichshafen site in Germany.

Airbus leads an industrial consortium comprising more than 110 companies in 16 European countries and Canada, to supply more than 160 different pieces of equipment and services for the satellites’ platforms and instruments.



Each satellite, with a launch mass of approximately 4 tonnes, will be launched separately. The satellites will be placed on the MetOp sun-synchronous polar orbit, at an average altitude of 831 kilometres. The nominal service life of each satellite is 7.5 years. After 7 years, the subsequent satellite of the same series will be launched, ensuring full operational coverage over a period of 21 years with a pair of A and B type satellites always in orbit.



The first launch of a MetOp-SG satellite is currently scheduled for early 2024.

Airbus Delivers The 100th A400M Atlas Tactical Airlifter - The Aviationist,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjcvMTAwdGgtYTQwMG0tYXRsYXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A400M global fleet also reached the 100,000 flight hours milestone during the same week

Airbus announced the delivery of the 100th operational A400M tactical airlifter on May 24, 2021. The aircraft, with airframe number MSN111, is the tenth A400M for the Spanish Air Force out of a total order of 27 aircraft and performed its ferry flight from Seville, where the final assembly line is located, to Zaragoza, where the Spanish A400M fleet is based. This milestone was also accompanied by the eight A400M users reaching 100,000 flight-hours performing missions worldwide.

According to Airbus, the latest milestones reached by the A400M program demonstrate the degree of maturity reached by the aircraft since its first flight in 2009. Since the first delivery to the French Air Force in 2013, the A400M proved to be a versatile aircraft, even with the high and lows associated to any new aircraft, which could be adapted to perform many roles thanks to the new capabilities being added through the years.

Important milestone achieved with the delivery of the 100th #A400M incl.all new certified capabilities.

At the same time, the global A400M fleet also achieved the 100k flight-hours landmark performing missions worldwide for all 8 customer nations.

Last month Airbus announced that the A400M successfully completed a new Helicopter Air-to-Air Refueling (HAAR) test campaign, getting closer to the full helicopter air-to-air refueling certification which is expected later this year. During the tests, the A400M refueled two French Air Force H225M Caracal helicopters in day and night conditions over the west coast of France at between 1,000 ft and 10,000 ft and speeds as low as 105 knots. Until now the A400M was cleared to refuel only fixed wing aircraft, with Germany becoming the first user to deploy it operationally in the “Counter Daesh” operation in Jordan to refuel fighter jets during CAS and ISR missions.

Another capability is the ability to drop up to 116 paratroopers via either static line jumping or military free fall both day and night. An impressive demonstration came last year when a Spanish A400M dropped 114 skydivers to celebrate the anniversary of the Military Paratrooper School and the milestone of one and a half million jumps since its foundation. Recent tests were completed in Spain, in collaboration with the Royal Air Force parachute test team, to expand the envelope up to 25,000 feet (7,600 metres) for static line jumping – and up to 38,000ft (11,582 metres) for free fall.

The Atlas also completed additional tests to expand its air drop capability, including multiple platforms with automatic parachute extraction up to 23 tonnes, with France and Spain working together in these flights. Another way to deliver cargo on austere airstrips without handling equipment available to support the aircraft was also certified, allowing the combat offload of up to 19 tonnes of pallets (one pass) or 25 tonnes (two passes) on paved or unpaved airstrips. The first combat airdrop of supplies was performed last year by a French A400M in the Sahel region of Africa, with the delivery of almost 40 tonnes of food, water, fuel and ammunition to French troops deployed there.

The A400M also successfully completed the certification flights of the Automatic Low Level Flight capability for Instrumental Meteorological Conditions (IMC), which relies on navigation systems and terrain databases, instead of using a terrain-following radar, decreasing the electromagnetic emissions and making the aircraft less detectable in hostile areas and thus less susceptible to threats while conducting operations in hostile environments.

The Covid-19 pandemic provided an occasion for the aircraft to be used more intensively, performing daily emergency response missions like civil medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and transport of key medical relief supplies. This was possible also thanks to the short time needed to reconfigure the cargo bay, which allowed a rapid conversion to the MEDEVAC configuration via the installation of critical care modules to provide airborne intensive care for the patients.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9953813552856445}",neutral,0.9953813552856445,0

The solar arrays are a 20kW-class system that deploys over 18 meters in order to provide energy to OneSat.

Northrop Grumman’s CTA system was developed for missions like OneSat that require extremely compact stowage volume for spacecraft launch while remaining lightweight. Northrop Grumman’s CTA creates enough space to allow for three full spacecraft to be launched aboard a single rocket.

The use of Northrop Grumman’s solar arrays to support the OneSat product line builds on the company’s history of mission-enabling capability through solar technology. These technologies are used to support various commercial and civil space programs, including the commercial resupply of the International Space Station through the company’s Cygnus spacecraft, several of its commercial satellites and NASA’s Insight and Phoenix Mars Landers.

In addition to the solar arrays, Northrop Grumman will also provide heat pipes that are an essential element for payload thermal management as well as propellant tanks in support of a mono-propellant propulsion system for OneSat.

“The technology used for our solar arrays allows for an efficient launch and is one of our many company-designed advanced components that enable satellites of all classes to perform their missions,” said Frank Bernas, vice president, space components and strategic businesses, Northrop Grumman.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993725419044495}",neutral,0.9993725419044495,0
Qantas sees six Airbus A380s return by 2023 - AeroTime,"Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc5NjYtcWFudGFzLXNlZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcmV0dXJuLTIwMjPSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI3OTY2LXFhbnRhcy1zZWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXJldHVybi0yMDIzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The status of the Airbus A380 aircraft has been questioned ever since the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on the international travel market. However, Qantas CEO believes that the world’s largest passenger aircraft will return to the skies, once international air travel recovers. Australian flag-carrier reportedly plans to return six Super Jumbos by 2023.

“If they [Airbus A380s – ed.note] do come back in when we expect them, at the end of 2023, we’ll activate the first six aircraft very rapidly because we’ll have the pilots to do it,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Executive Traveller on May 20, 2021.

Currently, Qantas has a total of 12 Airbus A380 aircraft in its fleet, as per planespotters.net data. Due to travel restrictions, all of the airline’s double-deckers are parked in Victorville Southern California Logistics (LCV) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), United States. The Australian airline grounded the aircraft in June 2020, saying that A380s would be of no use for at least three years.

Earlier in April 2021, Joyce said that the airline hoped to have all of the A380s reactivated once international travel demand returned. However, hopes to reactivate all of its Super Jumbos might be dimmed, as Qantas has revised its international travel restart from October 2021 to December 2021.

“We think we will reactivate all of the A380s. We spent a lot of money on them,” Joyce revealed during CAPA live on April 14, 2021. “Once demand is there, they are going to be good aircraft.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997537732124329}",neutral,0.9997537732124329,0

The ACH160 is the premium version of the new H160 helicopte, which was certified by EASA last July.

Frederic Lemos, head of ACH, said: “The aircraft was certified in July last year. Covid-19 has delayed the capacity to meet the lead times we were foreseeing.” However, Lemos was confident that deliveries would begin late this year and in early 2022. Airbus has received orders from customers in eight countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, China and South-East Asia.

Lemos did not specify how many but mentioned there would be deliveries in the New York area. A video played during the conference showed the speed and manoeuvrability of the ACH 160, competing against a Renault Formula One car.

Elsewhere, ACH models 135 and 145 are popular options for operation on superyachts, said Lemos.

“The superyacht segment is a great niche in the market. Airbus Corporate Helicopters has more than a 70% market share, with the ACH 135 and 145 perfectly suited to the role.”

The top end of the superyacht market saw the most demand for helicopters aboard, with owners adding up to two helidecks sometimes. He said Airbus is tracking 78 new builds on yachts, meaning increased demand for more units is a possibility.

The ACH 130, complete with Aston Martin interior, is another example of how the company is serving the very top end of the market. “We’ve sold seven ACH 130 Aston Martin editions,” said Lemos.

In the past, the company has collaborated with Hermès and Mercedes Benz to produce similar ranges. Lemos told viewers the increasing need for customisation of interiors is a longer-term trend. An in-house Creative Design department offers bespoke solutions to customers.

When asked whether existing ACH products would shape the urban air mobility platforms, Lemos said: “When it will come to UAM platforms, the first clientele will be ultra-high net worth individuals [UHNWI]. And UNHWI are 80% of ACH customers. So, at this stage we are not yet shaping the market in this direction, but ACH will have an important role to play in the future in the market.”

The company showed 289 gross orders (net: 268) and 300 rotorcraft deliveries in 2020. These are down compared with 2019’s figures, which stood at 369 orders and 332 deliveries and ensured a 54% market share.

Lemos added: “The sub segments more impacted are the medium to large aircraft. Single engine aircraft and light have not suffered that much. We see a lot of transactions happening on the H130, which is the market favourite, with the H125.”

IDAHOBIT 2021: Committed to the fight against discrimination - Airbus,"Mon, 17 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LWlkYWhvYml0LTIwMjEtY29tbWl0dGVkLXRvLXRoZS1maWdodC1hZ2FpbnN0LWRpc2NyaW1pbmF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The IDAHOBIT 2021 slogan challenges us to rethink how everyone can feel included and valued in the workplace. Our Business Champions are leading the way toward a safe work environment where diversity is of the essence. As we join the fight against discrimination on May 17th, we should remember that stereotypes and prejudice must be battled every single day, thanks to continuous improvement of our choices and behavior.

May 17th is IDAHOBIT, the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexphobia and Transphobia. A reminder that the fight against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation is not over, IDAHOBIT also embodies the power of collective intelligence. It paves the way for a workplace where everyone’s input is valued and their well-being essential to the development of an inclusive culture within the company. If speaking up is becoming a regular practice and helping everyone to make their voices heard, the journey toward inclusion and diversity still calls for continuous improvement of our collective behavior and choices.

In order to strengthen the programmes already implemented by the Inclusion & Diversity team, new roles were recently created: the Business Champions. For each business area, the Business Champions design yearly objectives, based on the wider ones enacted for the whole group. Thanks to steady talks with their teams, the Business Champions are able to answer the employees’ needs and help them participate in the transformation of the company’s representation. With 13 Business Champions currently sitting on the Airbus Helicopters I&D Active Board, multiple initiatives are in the works to tackle the sources of discrimination in the workplace.

Together: Resisting, Supporting, Healing

In 2021, IDAHOBIT’s theme came down to four words: Together: Resisting, Supporting, Healing. They can take on different meanings depending on our personal understanding of the slogan, but one thing is for sure: they embrace what every member of the company aspires to achieve through the I&D action plan of their business area. Jerome Combe, HO Product Policy and Strategy, says: “As a Business Champion, I believe it is crucial for us to see diversity in all its forms as a source of inspiration and growth. We shouldn’t deprive ourselves of the unique outlook every individual brings to the company.”

The IDAHOBIT 2021 slogan encapsulates what we have to accomplish in order for everyone to thrive at work. Just as we are pioneering sustainable aerospace in a safe and united world, we have joined the fight against discrimination to build more connected communities, while we all realise how much we miss being together to defend a common purpose. As a result, we must resist in the face of stereotypes and preconceived notions, or as Combe puts it: “Resist those who don’t respect our differences. When we need to hide because of these reactions, we waste so much energy. Our goal is to make sure it is smoothly redirected toward new ideas and projects within Airbus.”

As for supporting, according to Véronique Dalmasso, Aviation Safety & Quality Project Manager and Business Champion, it is the only way to ensure collective growth in all business areas: “We must bring our unconditional support to diversity in order to realise how strong it makes us.” When battling prejudice, we also shouldn’t forget that the wounds it inflicts need to be healed, so that those who were injured can show their true self to the world, without fearing other people’s reactions. Dalmasso added: “The consequences of these injustices have to be healed, so as to restore the transformational power of our differences.''

As a Business Champion, I believe it is crucial for us to see diversity in all its forms as a source of inspiration and growth. We shouldn’t deprive ourselves of the unique outlook every individual brings to the company.

Jerome Combe, HO Product Policy and Strategy

What’s next to build an inclusive and diverse workplace?

Our efforts shouldn’t stop after IDAHOBIT: discrimination must be fought at every turn to see the lasting effects of Inclusion & Diversity policies. Combe explains: “That’s why we need bold actions for IDAHOBIT: we must go further than just putting rainbow flags up on May 17th.” In addition to celebrating LGBTQ+ people’s uniqueness on that date, it is essential that we keep working on concrete ways to improve their well-being in the company. For example, as a means for each employee to realise how biases affect their decisions and behavior toward other people, multiple awareness sessions have been organized, dealing with unconscious biases and how to lessen their impact in the workplace. To contribute to the journey toward this ambition, the Business Champions are designing innovative means to build diverse teams and deepen solidarity between their members. Martin Werner, HO Central Operations, says: “People are different. And it is precisely this diversity that can help us develop new ideas and reach a common future.”

To support inclusive leadership through the application of Speak Up and Listen Up culture, each employee has to ask themself: what kind of change can I make to my business area, and more widely to our workplace, to guarantee that every team member can express themself and open up about how they feel at work?

Combe sums it up: “It is a great challenge for all of us. But in the end, what’s important is that we resist together and support each other, so that no one has to be healed again because of prejudice and discrimination.”

Brussels, 31 May 2021 – The European Commission has selected a consortium of companies and research institutes to study the design of the future European quantum communication network, EuroQCI (quantum communication infrastructure). It will enable ultra-secure communication between critical infrastructures and government institutions across the European Union.

The European consortium led by Airbus is composed of Leonardo, Orange, PwC France and Maghreb, Telespazio (a Leonardo and Thales 67/33 joint venture), the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) and the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM).

The EuroQCI will integrate quantum technologies and systems into terrestrial fibre optic communication networks, and will include a space-based segment ensuring full coverage across the EU and other continents. Ultimately, this will enable secure Europe’s encryption systems and critical infrastructures such as government institutions, air traffic control, healthcare facilities, banks and power grids against current and future cyber threats.

Since June 2019, 26 Member States have signed the EuroQCI Declaration, agreeing to work together with the Commission, supported by the European Space Agency, towards the development of a quantum communication infrastructure covering the whole EU.

The long-term plan is for the EuroQCI to become the basis of a quantum internet in Europe, connecting quantum computers, simulators and sensors via quantum networks to distribute information and resources with a state of the art security method.

The first service to make use of it will be quantum key distribution (QKD). The QKD service will transmit encryption keys through quantum communication channels on both terrestrial fibre optic and space laser links. Using quantum photon states makes key distribution immune to vulnerabilities unlike the current methods.

The 15-month study will set out the details of the end-to-end system and design the terrestrial segment supporting the QKD service. It will develop a detailed implementation roadmap, including the cost and timeline of each implementation phase. In addition, the study will support the European Commission in designing an advanced QCI testing and validation infrastructure including standards. The objective is to run a EuroQCI demonstrator by 2024 and an initial operational service by 2027.

The consortium will benefit from the complementarity of its members, which include large system integrators, telco and satcom operators and service providers, along with research institutes. The study will leverage and strengthen the existing contributions in various quantum projects made by each consortium member and will benefit from extensive field experience of the Italian quantum backbone thanks to CNR and INRiM.

Airbus – New Wing Design In The Works For A New A322? - Mentour Pilot,"Wed, 26 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXJidXMtbmV3LXdpbmctZGVzaWduLWluLXRoZS13b3Jrcy1mb3ItYS1uZXctYTMyMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | May 26, 2021

Airbus is working on a new lightweight composite wing project, that could soon lead to a stretch-A321 variant, to become the A322!

Airbus calls it “the future-wing project”. Composite materials are not new for the manufacturer. The A350 has a composite wing and fuselage. And the A220 that they ‘inherited’ from Bombardier also has a composite wing, too. But the newer, future-wing project is mainly about making Airbus’ new wings both affordable and faster to produce. However, it could also be a candidate for use in a longer member of the A320neo family.

The idea of a stretched A321 is by no means new. The launch of the A321XLR in particular has paved the road for a stretch version of the jet. The XLR brings a higher Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) and more powerful engines. But that’s not quite enough, for a stretch A322 variant. With such a stretch, Airbus could have some of the issues that Boeing has, after repetitively stretching its 737. To avoid these, Airbus may need new landing gear as well.

A New Wing For An Old (?) Airbus

And realistically, Airbus would also need a new wing, to launch an A322. This alone previously made analysts very skeptical about the likelihood of such a project. The A320 family’s wing has remained largely the same since the type’s launch in the late 1980s. Airbus gave it new winglets a few years ago, and they are redesigning its flaps for the XLR. The inboard flaps for this newest A321neo variant are single-slotted, rather than double-slotted.

Airbus could retrofit these XLR inboard flaps to other A321s, as long as they have the newer winglets. But it looks like they have something far more radical in mind, for their single-aisle lineup. The A321 can already seat a maximum of 240 people, in a single-class configuration. With its new wing, an Airbus A322 stretch would allow four extra rows of seats. So 24 extra seats in total, for a 262-seat aircraft. Or, the length could allow for much more flexibility in cabin layouts, for long-haul operations.

At this point, it’s unclear if this is already a concrete plan for Airbus, or simply a concept – a way to pre-empt anything Boeing does. Airbus will have to spend way less on an all-new wing than Boeing would, on an all-new airliner. We have previously seen the progression of Boeing’s options for a New Midsize Airplane (NMA). More recently, analysts tend to call it the New Boeing Airplane (NBA)…

A Competitive Advantage Rear Guard?

Analysts estimate the cost for a new Airbus A322 wing plus provisions for larger engines (landing gear?) to $4.9 billion. This compares well with Boeing’s cost for a brand-new jet, which could be between $15-20 billion. Which Boeing may or may not have. This does not look good for Boeing, considering that Airbus already have a more complete single-aisle airliner lineup on offer.

Airbus’ composite wing programme isn’t new; they launched it in 2015. Boeing’s MAX problems gave Airbus valuable time, to develop technologies on composites further. But an announcement from Boeing that they are embarking on a new aircraft project, could trigger Airbus’ reaction. We don’t really have anything official from Boeing yet. However, we know that Boeing is bullish about advancements in composites. It seems that Airbus is banking on the same technology, too.

It’s probably worth pointing out here that we have seen something like this before. In the mid 00’s, the European manufacturer announced something they called “the A350”… but not the one you think. This was an Airbus A330 with a new composite wing and new engines. Airlines and lessors hated the idea. They quickly convinced Airbus to design a new fuselage, to go with the new composite wing and engines. They did, and we got the A350 we know today.

But eventually, Airbus also built the A330neo. Without a new wing. This was costly, but the A330neo is selling surprisingly well. So with no complaints about the A320’s fuselage, further developments, like new wings, make sense. Especially if new technology makes it more affordable to make.

Other New Wing Ideas For Airbus

To improve efficiency further, one suggestion is that Airbus could design a new wing that is longer and thinner. This would require folding wingtips, in order to access the same airport gates and avoid higher airport costs. This of course is something we saw already in the 777X – for the same reasons.

Another possible application for Airbus’ new wing technology is for a stretched A220. In theory, Bombardier designed the current (composite!) wing with such a stretch in mind. The technology of this composite wing may be one of the least-advertised key gains for Airbus, when they took over the program. But as we saw, the plane is expensive to make. So, newer technology may make it possible for Airbus to improve the wing AND make it affordable.

Airbus’ older production capacity target, for a hypothetical all-new A320 replacement, was at 100 aircraft per month. Pre-pandemic, they were approaching 52, aiming for 60 (for the A320). These bold future targets seem to echo what Boeing has been alluding to lately, with regard to new technologies around composites. Airbus and Boeing already know how to design a new, efficient composite wing. Now they’re figuring out how to do it more affordably and quickly.

Airbus has already stated that their next all-new aircraft will run on hydrogen. Whether or not they will actually follow through, those plans have a 2035 service date – before delays. Meanwhile, they can hone technologies on composites, with projects like this. But if Airbus DO proceed with those hydrogen plans, advanced composites will be invaluable.

The hydrogen dimension is further down the road for Airbus. But developing relevant technologies while keeping Boeing’s NMA/NBA at bay, is more than a mere bonus.

Airbus to ramp up A320 production in anticipation of recovery - AeroTime,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjgwMjktYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJhbXAtdXAtYTMyMC1wcm9kdWN0aW9u0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODAyOS1haXJidXMtdG8tcmFtcC11cC1hMzIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft manufacturer Airbus announced that it would ramp up its best-selling Airbus A320 aircraft family production rate in anticipation of the commercial aircraft market reaching pre-pandemic levels between 2023 and 2025. The move stands out in an industry that still struggles after the pandemic took its toll on travel demand.

“The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis”, said Guillaume Faury, the Airbus CEO.

In the message on production plans, Airbus called on suppliers to be ready to raise output of its narrow-body Airbus A320 aircraft family. The aircraft manufacturer confirmed an average production rate to reach 45 aircraft per month in Q4 2021. Airbus also outlined plans to secure a firm output of 64 aircraft per month in Q2 2023. In anticipation of market recovery, Airbus said that the figure of Airbus A320 aircraft family production rate could rise to 70 by Q1 2024 and 75 by 2025.

To date, Airbus average production rates for the A320 aircraft family totalled 40 aircraft per month, according to Airbus statement released on January 21, 2021.

“The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities,” Faury added.

In 2021, the Airbus A220 and the Airbus A350 aircraft production rates stand at an average of five per month. However, Airbus expects to increase them to six by autumn 2022. As for the Airbus A330 family, production remains at an average monthly rate of two per month without plans to ramp it up in the near future.

On May 21, 2021, Airbus announced it had started its first Airbus A321 Extra Long Range (XLR) aircraft structural production, marking a significant milestone in the Airbus A321XLR program.

“It’s a major milestone for the A321XLR program. The teams can be proud of this achievement and the overall speed of industrialization. We are on track with our planning,” said Martin Schnoor, the Head of A321 XLR Program Development Airframe Program.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6848798990249634}",positive,0.6848798990249634,1

Airbus Corporate Jet (ACJ) teams have developed the first digital Airbus cabin configurator - showcasing a new design approach specifically for the ACJ TwoTwenty, the latest member of the ACJ Family.

Cabin is centre stage for the ""premiere""

""This is another ""first"" for Airbus, history in the making, and the ACJ TwoTwenty is no stranger to standing out in the new ""Xtra Large Bizjet"" market,” explains Sylvain Mariat, Head of ACJ Creative Design.

""The ACJ TwoTwenty is a complete ""aircraft-cabin"" offer to our VIP, corporate and charter customers, a unique product with a catalogue offering 3 different ambiences, spanning 6 living spaces of a total of 73m² / 785ft². This makes it extremely suitable for a digital configuration,"" says Sylvain.

During the development phase of the configurator, the project team were inspired by solutions found in the hotel and luxury car industries, taking digital technologies and the customisation experience to another level. The result is an interactive configurator that offers superior ambience opportunities and over 120 layout options.

A panoramic 3D view lets the user project themself into a real life situation, to test their cabin configuration choice. The details of the personalised configuration can then be downloaded to assist them with their choices.

Supporting customers through the crisis

For the ACJ team, the configurator allows them to support their customers through design innovation.

""In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly important to maintain the link with the customer, and being able to visit the aircraft together, without having to travel is an undeniable asset. The configurator allows our teams to quickly understand our customer's needs by offering them an immersive experience using a PC, a tablet or a virtual reality headset,"" explains Sylvain.



An immersive experience

Virtual reality is a step forward in the development process: ""In the short term, we want to provide total immersion in a 3D environment, by following the movements of the user: opening a door will no longer be an obstacle,"" says Sylvain.

Virtual reality will offer enriched content and real-time access to all the options in the catalogue, such as materials, lighting and day/night ambiences.

Currently tested in product campaigns, ACJ's sales teams and future ACJ TwoTwenty customers are excited about the concept and its new features, which will be showcased at the upcoming Las Vegas Business Aviation Show in October.

The ACJ TwoTwenty will enter service in early 2023, with Comlux our launch customer and exclusive cabin outfitting partner for the first 15 cabins.
