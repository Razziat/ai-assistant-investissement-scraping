Toulouse - Airbus has acquired industrial automation company, MTM Robotics, for an undisclosed sum. The move deepens Airbus’ commitment to expanding advanced robotics capabilities within its manufacturing processes. The MTM business will retain its current leadership and 40-person staff, as well as its facility in Mukilteo, Washington, near Seattle.



“We are pleased and excited to become a part of the Airbus family and look forward to further integrating our products and approaches into the Airbus industrialization chain, “said MTM founder, Mike Woogerd.



The acquisition is the latest chapter in a trusted, ten-year-plus relationship between the companies, with multiple MTM light automated robotics systems currently in use at Airbus manufacturing facilities. While MTM will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus Americas, Inc., headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, it will continue to serve other customers in the aerospace industry. Since 2003, MTM has deployed more than 40 aerospace manufacturing systems comprised of machines, tools, machine software, enterprise software and support throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.



The acquisition marks the latest step for Airbus in its industrialization roadmap, aimed at leveraging the time- and cost-saving benefits associated with using robotics in the manufacture and assembly of its commercial aircraft.



""The competitiveness of tomorrow will be determined by both designing the best aircraft and by building the most efficient manufacturing system, in parallel,“ said Michael Schoellhorn, Airbus Chief Operating Officer.“ Automation & robotics are central to our industrial strategy. We are very happy to welcome MTM Robotics as a family member and take a step forward on this exciting endeavour together.""



“MTM perfectly fits Airbus’ ambition for engineering and innovative manufacturing solutions while maintaining agility,” explained Patrick Vigié, Head of Industrial Technologies at Airbus.



“Airbus and MTM Robotics each believe that tomorrow’s automation in aircraft manufacturing can and must be lighter, more portable and less capital intensive,” explained Vigié. “By joining our efforts and skills, we are well positioned to establish industrywide standards for the factory of tomorrow, “he said.

Airbus acquires MTM Robotics in Boeing's backyard - GeekWire,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE5L2FpcmJ1cy1hY3F1aXJlcy1tdG0tcm9ib3RpY3MtbWFrZXMtYWlyY3JhZnQtYnVpbGRpbmctc3lzdGVtcy1ib2VpbmdzLWJhY2t5YXJkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says it has acquired MTM Robotics, a Seattle-area company that provides automated systems for aerospace manufacturing, for an undisclosed sum.

MTM’s headquarters are in Mukilteo, Wash., just a few miles from Boeing’s Everett factory. But MTM has had a close connection to Boeing’s European archrival: For more than a decade, the company has provided light automated robotics systems for Airbus’ manufacturing facilities.

As an subsidiary of Virginia-based Airbus Americas Inc., MTM will retain its current leadership and 40-employee staff at the 10,000-square-foot Mukilteo facility, Airbus said today in a news release.

“We are pleased and excited to become a part of the Airbus family, and look forward to further integrating our products and approaches into the Airbus industrialization chain,” MTM founder Mike Woogerd said.

Since its inception in 2003, MTM, formerly known as Mobile Tool Management, has deployed more than 40 aerospace manufacturing systems — including machines, tools and software — throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition to Airbus, its customers have included Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Airbus said the acquisition is part of its strategy to take advantage of robotics to reduce the time and the cost of assembling commercial aircraft.

“The competitiveness of tomorrow will be determined by both designing the best aircraft and by building the most efficient manufacturing system, in parallel,“ said Michael Schoellhorn, Airbus’ chief operating officer. “Automation and robotics are central to our industrial strategy. We are very happy to welcome MTM Robotics as a family member and take a step forward on this exciting endeavor together.”

Boeing has also brought more automation and robotics into its manufacturing process over the past few years, sometimes with mixed results. Last month, The Seattle Times reported that Boeing stopped using a fuselage assembly system because it turned out that humans were more reliable than the robots."

Airbus has wrapped up flight testing of a pilotless air taxi in Eastern Oregon skies and is moving on. The global aerospace company, along with its rival Boeing and many others, is striving to make flying cars an option for your urban commute someday.

Airbus completed 138 flights with an electric, single-seat shuttlecraft at the Pendleton Unmanned Aerial Systems Range. The farthest distance the battery-powered, self-flying prototype traveled on a single charge was 27 miles and the longest duration flight lasted about 20 minutes.

""In the end, we couldn't be more proud of the stats we put up on the board with this project,"" said Zach Lovering, vice president for urban air mobility systems at Airbus, in a blog post.

Lovering said the eight-rotor, tilt-wing design named Vahana achieved its primary goals of demonstrating the viability of a passenger drone.

""We surpassed the range we were expecting from the beginning,"" Lovering said. ""So, it does show this kind of configuration works and you actually can do some interesting things with electric propulsion today.""

Lovering said additional important breakthroughs were achieved in validating autonomous detect-and-avoid systems against birds or other aircraft in the air and potential obstacles in the landing zone.

There was no human on board for any of Vahana's test flights. In Europe, the company continues to flight test a larger robo air taxi with a different rotor configuration dubbed CityAirbus.

The lessons from both aircraft development programs will be combined into a new iteration that could be the precursor for series production. Lovering said the design work on that higher capacity, next-generation model is already underway.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Lovering said he would not be surprised if one of the dozens of other aerospace companies and startups working on urban air mobility begins commercial passenger service before Airbus. He said his company is proceeding methodically to protect its reputation for safe and robustly designed aircraft. Lovering projected a mid-to-late 2020s timeframe for the release of a vehicle that consumers could board.

Lovering has previously stated a goal to provide on-demand, crosstown air travel in large, congested urban areas at a price that is competitive with a taxi ride on the ground. Airbus named its prototype Vahana in an allusion to Hindu mythology and flying carpets.

Airbus is one of the highest-profile customers to be lured to Pendleton's city-owned airport and UAS test range. Lovering estimated the company created four to six temporary, full-time jobs at its Pendleton hangar, along with bringing waves of technicians and contractors from other locations as specialized skills were needed.

Pendleton test range manager Darryl Abling said there were no mishaps in the air or on the ground during Vahana's nearly two-year flight test campaign.

""We are thrilled that we were a part of it and that we were able to work with them on a very successful flight test program,"" Abling said.

""In the last six months or a year, it's been performing pretty incredible movements,"" Pendleton airport director Steve Chrisman said in regard to the experimental aircraft. ""It really hammered home just what a reality ""The Jetsons"" are and what our future skies are going to look like.""

Chrisman said several other companies are interested in leasing the newly vacated hangar space that Airbus occupied.

This fall, the city broke ground on a publicly-financed unmanned aerial systems industrial park adjacent to a dedicated runway at the airport. The goal is to bring more drone business and high-tech jobs to the uncongested skies of northeastern Oregon.

Lovering, Abling and Chrisman all said one of their lasting memories of the Vahana project would be the maiden flight of the stubby aircraft in Pendleton on Jan. 31, 2018. The flight testing concluded last month after racking up 13.4 hours of total flight time.

Airbus built two prototypes with the tilt-wing Vahana design. Only one of them flew. The second exemplar was displayed at air shows and trade shows on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to promote Airbus' ideas for urban air mobility. Lovering said Airbus plans to keep at least one of the Vahana models for display at its Silicon Valley outpost.

For its part, Boeing is testing a two-seat robo air taxi developed by its Aurora Flight Sciences subsidiary. The Boeing electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) prototype made its maiden flight in January and is undergoing further refinement at the Manassas, Virginia, airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration still needs to define how it will certify this new class of passenger-carrying aircraft. Separately, governments and aircraft makers are pouring millions of dollars into air traffic control studies. One of those trials will unfold over the inland Northwest next year, using unmanned drones provided by defense contractor PAE ISR."

Over the last five decades, Airbus has developed into a global aviation giant. The European consortium and Boeing now make up the duopoly that dominates the global commercial aircraft industry.

But most people are not aware of the substantial manufacturing footprint Toulouse, France-based Airbus has in the US. This includes helicopters in Mississippi and satellites in Florida.

And then there's the crown jewel, the commercial aircraft final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

This is where the company produces Airbus A320-family jets for US customers such as American, Delta, Jetblue, Frontier, Spirit, Allegiant, and Hawaiian Airlines.

The Airbus A320-family of jets, which includes the A319, A320, and A321, is also assembled in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Tianjin, China.

The European aviation giant first made its presence felt in Mobile with the establishment of the Airbus Engineering Center in January 2007 that has since helped develop systems for the Airbus A330, A350, and A380 airliners.

Back then, there were quite a few people within the company that questioned whether a Mobile campus was really needed, Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders recounted to reporters in January. There are ""no longer"" any doubters, Enders added.

Earlier this year, Airbus broke ground on a second final assembly line at its Mobile complex to build the new A220 airliner. The A220, previously known as the Bombardier C Series, is currently assembled exclusively in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada.

The new Mobile A220 plant is expected to produce four planes a month, Airbus Americas CEO Jeff Knittel told reporters.

Shortly, after the groundbreaking ceremony, Business Insider got the chance to step inside the A320 plant.

Here's a closer look at the Airbus A320-family production facility in Mobile, Alabama.

At the same time, Airbus is expanding its original A320 assembly line to accommodate a production ramp-up to six aircraft a month, up from four today.

Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said the A220 assembly line project represents an important milestone for the state’s robust aerospace sector.

“Airbus’ decision to launch production of A220 aircraft at a new assembly line in Mobile will act as a powerful catalyst for sustained growth in an industrial sector that is key to Alabama’s future,” Secretary Canfield said.

“Airbus’ expanding presence in the Mobile aerospace cluster will spark significant job creation and spur additional aerospace investment in the region for many years.”

In late 2018, Airbus launched construction on the second assembly line on its Mobile campus. The project involves a $264 million investment and the creation of over 430 jobs.

The new assembly line at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, adjacent to the A320 Family production line, will facilitate assembly of A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft for U.S. customers.

Jeff Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas, said Airbus’ expansion project reflects the company’s growing partnerships with customers, as well as with U.S. supplier-partners and the communities in which the company operates across the nation.

“Our partnerships are growing again with the addition of an A220 manufacturing facility that will employ some 400 more employees at full rate,” Knittel said at a groundbreaking ceremony.

“Together we’ve already put Mobile on the map in the world of global aviation, and together we are making a new mark for the future.”

AIDT, which has played a key role in helping Airbus assemble an Alabama workforce, has been called on to help the manufacturer hire 600 new workers, split between the new A220 line and the A320 line.

“The addition of the new Airbus A220 family of aircraft in Mobile is proof that Alabama is well positioned with its workforce training to meet the needs of manufacturers all over the world,” said Ed Castile, director of AIDT and deputy secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“AIDT has worked with Airbus since the beginning, and we’re honored to continue our support,” he added.

A220 production is planned to begin in the A320 facility in late 2019, with first delivery of a Mobile-assembled A220 aircraft scheduled for 2020. The new A220 production facility will be complete that year.

Airbus and Canada’s Bombardier finalized plans in 2018 to form a joint venture to produce Bombardier’s C Series passenger jet, now called the Airbus A220.

Airbus delivered its first Alabama-built A320 Family passenger jet in 2016, and it has since delivered more than 120 aircraft to customers at the $600 manufacturing facility in Mobile.

Once the new facility is at full production, Airbus plans to build four A220 aircraft each month in Alabama."

United Airlines orders 50 new Airbus jets in latest hit to Boeing - Al Jazeera English,"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDE5LzEyLzQvdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy01MC1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWpldHMtaW4tbGF0ZXN0LWhpdC10by1ib2VpbmfSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9lY29ub215LzIwMTkvMTIvNC91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtb3JkZXJzLTUwLW5ldy1haXJidXMtamV0cy1pbi1sYXRlc3QtaGl0LXRvLWJvZWluZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The $7bn deal makes United Airlines the second US carrier to buy the new European jet after fresh US tariffs on Airbus.

United Airlines Holdings Inc announced on Tuesday an order for 50 Airbus SE A321XLR jets to fly between the United States East Coast and Europe, becoming the latest US airline to sign a deal for the European plane maker’s new passenger jet.

The long-range A321XLR jets will replace United’s 53 Boeing 757-200 planes beginning in 2024, the Chicago-based airline said, flying to cities like Porto, Portugal and other potential new destinations.

The deal, valued at $7.1bn before customary discounts, will replace its Boeing 757-200 jets that reach the end of their lifespan in about 10 years.

Boeing Co is not building any more of the large single-aisle model.

Instead, the US plane-maker has been considering a new twin-aisle plane, provisionally known as the NMA, but has delayed a launch decision until 2020 while it manages the continued global grounding of its 737 MAX jets following two fatal crashes.

United’s chief operating officer Andrew Nocella told reporters the airline has worked closely with Boeing on the potential new aircraft and is still open to orders if the plane-maker decides to move forward with developing the NMA.

“The new Airbus A321XLR aircraft is an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.

Other US carriers, including American Airlines Group Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp and Spirit Airlines Inc, have agreed on orders for Airbus A320neo-family jets.

Among the benefits of the A321XLR is a 30 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation aircraft, United said.

United has also ordered the larger A350 widebody jets but said it is deferring delivery of those jets until they are needed in 2027.

Its A321XLR order is the second for a US carrier following tariffs that the US is imposing on European-made aircraft."
WTO rules against EU in Airbus case - DW (English),"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi91cy1jb3VsZC1pbmNyZWFzZS10YXJpZmZzLWFmdGVyLXd0by1yZWplY3RzLWV1LWRlbmlhbHMtb3Zlci1haXJidXMtc3Vic2lkaWVzL2EtNTE1MDgwMjDSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vdXMtY291bGQtaW5jcmVhc2UtdGFyaWZmcy1hZnRlci13dG8tcmVqZWN0cy1ldS1kZW5pYWxzLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLXN1YnNpZGllcy9hLTUxNTA4MDIw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US has said it may increase tariffs after the EU lost its case at the WTO. The US claimed that loans made by the EU to Airbus for the development of the A380 and other aircraft represented an unfair advantage.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday dismissed European Union suggestions that the bloc no longer subsidizes Airbus, the Europe-based multinational aerospace corporation.

As a response to the WTO's conclusion, the United States said it could impose tariffs on a broader range of European goods, as it seeks to assert its authority in the long-lasting dispute between the world's two principle constructors of airplanes — Airbus and Boeing.

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that the financial help the EU affords the European plane-maker does serious damage to the US aerospace industry.

In October of this year, the US imposed a record $7.5 billion (€6.8 billion) in levies on annual EU imports as part of its case against Airbus. The US placed partial tariffs on most jets from Airbus, as well as products such as cheese, olives and whiskey.

In Monday's ruling, a three-person panel rejected EU claims that a recent decision by Airbus to stop producing the slow-selling A380 meant the airliner could no longer be seen as a threat to Boeing, the American multinational corporation whose competing 747 faces falling demand.

The European Commission is considering appealing as it believes the WTO's findings contained serious legal errors.

History of the Airbus-Boeing dispute

The EU and the US have constantly claimed that each other's airplane manufacturer is unfairly subsidized.

It was the US that first filed a case with the WTO in 2006 claiming that Airbus, which is jointly owned by Germany, France, Spain and Britain's BAE Systems, had received $22 billion (€19.4 billion) in illegal subsidies. US officials estimated that the subsidies had resulted in an economic benefit of more than $200 billion.

The EU retaliated with a countercase, alleging that Boeing had received $23 billion in ""trade-distorting"" subsidies in the US mainly for its research and development projects.

Better Buy: Boeing vs. Airbus - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzEyLzEyL2JldHRlci1idXktYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Which aerospace giant is poised to soar higher?

The global battle for commercial air superiority pits Boeing (BA -1.96%) against Airbus (EADSY -1.30%), two global titans with portfolios of large and midsize jets that account for most global commercial aviation flying. The companies also each have a smaller, but significant, defense division that should serve as a counterweight when an eventual commercial slowdown occurs.

Pilots, airlines, and even passengers often have preferences when it comes to choosing between flying Boeing or Airbus jets. But which is the better option for investors? Here's a look at the two aerospace giants to determine which, if either, is the better buy today.

Boeing: Battling through headwinds

Boeing is a diverse U.S. aerospace and defense giant with more than $100 billion in annual sales and a product lineup that includes space, military aircraft, helicopters, and even submarines, to go along with its stable of commercial aircraft. The company enjoys a multiyear commercial order backlog, and a series of important contract wins in the last 18 months has helped revitalize its defense unit.

But all of those reasons for optimism have been overshadowed of late by a pair of fatal crashes that led to the grounding of Boeing's new 737 MAX. Boeing has continued to manufacture the planes during the post-crash investigation, in part to keep its supply chain healthy, and is likely to face billions in losses as it compensates customers for the delays and expenses related to getting the growing backlog of jets ready for flight.

The investigation into what happened to the 737 MAX has revealed embarrassing details about how Boeing handled the certification process, adding to criticism of a company that has also in recent years faced a public rebuke by the Pentagon. Boeing is juggling multiple issues besides the 737 MAX, including testing setbacks with its planned 777X jet and troubles with its long-delayed refueling tanker.

Boeing hopes to have the 737 MAX back in service by early 2020, but the company's timeline is in danger of further slippage. Regulators are unlikely to move quickly toward recertification, and even after regulators give the plane the all clear to fly again, there is likely to be intense scrutiny on new deliveries that have been sitting parked for months, which will slow the delivery timetable.

At best the 737 MAX program is back at its pre-accident pace by mid-year 2020, but Boeing seems unlikely to follow through with its planned production boost from 42 frames per month to 52, and eventually 57, as quickly as it would have hoped. So even if the 737 MAX does end up the commercial hit that it was expected to be prior to the crashes, the payoff for investors is likely to drag into 2021 at least, and potentially into 2022.

Airbus: Ready for takeoff

Airbus, with sales of $60 billion, is an amalgamation of European aerospace companies cobbled together in the early 1970s to better compete against U.S. giants. The company, once known as European Aeronautic Defence and Space, took the Airbus name in 2017 and is today publicly traded, but remnants of its legacy structure remain.

The German, French, and Spanish governments together own more than 25% of the stock through state-owned holding companies, and politicians have historically used their ownership to block or influence corporate actions like potential mergers or restructurings.

Airbus arguably has the more complete lineup of commercial aircraft, thanks in part to its 2017 acquisition of a controlling stake in Bombardier's CSeries jet family, and the company boasts a larger backlog than Boeing. But it has also has been plagued by production problems that have caused it to miss delivery targets and burn cash. Some of the fault lies with suppliers, including United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney engines, but Airbus has also been delayed due to internal design changes and backed-up assembly lines.

Airbus' $11 billion defense business has historically been more of an afterthought than the Boeing Defense unit. Airbus Defence has a steady stream of revenue-generating contracts but appears to lack an innovative new potential platform that could move the needle in years to come.

The case for Airbus over Boeing is built around Airbus' more mature product line, which doesn't have the same risks as the 737 MAX and the 777X, and which should be a cash machine over the next few years. Between now and 2022, much of the cash that is generated from the Airbus backlog should fall straight to the bottom line at a time when Boeing is focused on research and development and compensation for 737 MAX issues.

And the better buy is...

Although there is the threat of new commercial aerospace competition coming from China, for the foreseeable future Boeing and Airbus largely enjoy a lucrative duopoly in airplane sales with a viable moat given how capital intensive and technically demanding this industry is. This is not a winner-take-all sort of competition, and I believe both Boeing and Airbus will be around for years to come, and shares of both should appreciate over time.

The question of which to buy now is best answered based on an investor's time horizon. Airbus over the next three to five years seems poised to outperform Boeing based on the expected expansion of free cash flow as it ramps up deliveries, which should help it to narrow a valuation gap that currently has Airbus shares trading at less than half Boeing's multiple to earnings and about 40% below Boeing's multiple to sales. Boeing, meanwhile, is likely to be mired down in 737 MAX issues well into 2021 and faces elevated R&D spending for the 777 and a potential 757 replacement.

Government ownership risk has historically been responsible for some of Airbus' discount and remains a worry. But the company under recently retired CEO Tom Enders made great strides in reducing political meddling. Investors should watch closely to see if new CEO Guillaume Faury is able to continue Enders push for independence.

Over a longer time horizon, it's hard not to be impressed by the breadth of Boeing's portfolio, and the company's outsize exposure to the massive U.S. defense and space markets. Boeing is likely the better bet for a true ""buy and forget about it"" investment with a multidecade time frame, but I'm worried the next few years could be rocky for this aerospace titan."

Vahana has come to an end. But a new chapter at Airbus has just begun - Airbus,"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTEyLXZhaGFuYS1oYXMtY29tZS10by1hbi1lbmQtYnV0LWEtbmV3LWNoYXB0ZXItYXQtYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1qdXN0LWJlZ3Vu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nearly four years after the Vahana concept was sketched on a napkin, the flagship programme that launched the urban air mobility initiative at Airbus has come to a close. Vahana’s key learnings are now providing Airbus Urban Mobility with invaluable insight on the design of its future urban air vehicle.

“It all started with a sketch on a napkin…” The Vahana story— when told by project team members—often starts this way. Some tell the story with a hint of wonder, others with a tinge of nostalgia.

Indeed, Vahana is a legend in its own right. And it is not hard to see why: a design that looked pulled from a sci-fi movie has quietly transformed into a fully operational electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in only a few short years.

The early sceptics can be forgiven: 2016 was a different time. Back then, no one could have predicted that leveraging the sky to improve urban mobility was practical. And yet, urban air mobility is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Today, it is one of the most exciting and promising markets in aerospace. And the extraordinary progress of Vahana has undoubtedly played a key role in bringing this vision closer to reality.

Vahana’s final test flight show more show less Discover how Vahana—Airbus’ first eVTOL demonstrator vehicle—took its final flight at the Pendleton UAS range in Oregon, USA nearly four years after the initial design was sketched on a napkin.

Learnings from both aircraft—Vahana and CityAirbus—will be used to advance our relationship with regulators and to understand key technologies.

Zach Lovering, VP of UAM Systems, Airbus

But, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. For Vahana, that day has come. On 14 November 2019, the final page of the Vahana story was written at the Pendleton UAS Range in Oregon, USA. Here, Vahana took its final test flight to the cheers (and some tears) of all those who have closely contributed to its extraordinary development.

Now as the dust settles on Vahana’s final flight, the next chapter in urban air mobility at Airbus is already taking shape.

A rich reservoir of key learnings on eVTOL technologies

From the outset, Vahana was designed as a technical demonstrator project. In the R&D community, “technical demonstrators” are commonly used to test high-potential technologies and to support their transfer to real-world applications. In other words, Vahana was never intended to become a commercialised product—instead, the Vahana team based at Acubed in Silicon Valley was tasked with important objectives relating to eVTOL development.

Zach Lovering, VP of UAM Systems at Airbus and head of Vahana, highlights the programme’s three main objectives:

Designing a fully operational eVTOL vehicle : A sketch on a napkin is one thing, but proving the technical viability of the configuration is quite another. The project team pushed its idea of a tilt-wing configuration with a suitable battery-to-electric-motor solution to the limits. When Vahana took its first flight in 2018, the leap from concept to reality was a success.

Proving the viability of self-piloting technologies : Vahana was launched at a time when real-time detect-and-avoid capabilities on small aircraft were considered a pipedream. Today, Vahana is fully capable of autonomously detecting airborne and ground hazards. The project was thus instrumental in helping to de-risk core elements of autonomy for urban air mobility vehicles and gave rise to Wayfinder, an ambitious autonomous flight technology project at Acubed.

Developing an eVTOL business case: What is the total operating cost of eVTOLs? How does it compare to traditional helicopters or taxis? What is the value for the community? How should they be certified? All of these questions need to be ironed out to create a compelling business case. And Vahana offers rich learnings in this respect.

The future is friendly for urban air mobility

Now that the Vahana programme has been completed, the project team is looking forward to applying the lessons learned to the future urban air vehicle at Airbus. And they will be in good company: the project team for CityAirbus—the second eVTOL demonstrator in the Airbus portfolio—will continue its flight test campaign throughout 2020 to be able to bring fresh insight to the concept development table.

“It’s bittersweet to see Vahana come to an end,” says Zach, who expressed his thoughts in a blog post. “But learnings from both aircraft—Vahana and CityAirbus—will be used to advance our relationship with regulators and to understand key technologies.”

Although precise timelines for the future vehicle are still to be determined, work on the new design has already begun. Airbus Urban Mobility is tasked with taking the lead on this front.

For the time being, one of the two Vahana “Alpha” aircraft will head to Acubed to act as inspiration for future ground-breaking projects. The other will make an appearance at the 2020 HAI Heliexpo in Anaheim, California."

Airbus begins deliveries of first A350 XWBs with touchscreen cockpit displays option to customers - Airbus,"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMi1haXJidXMtYmVnaW5zLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtb2YtZmlyc3QtYTM1MC14d2JzLXdpdGgtdG91Y2hzY3JlZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has commenced deliveries to airlines of the first A350 XWBs equipped with pioneering new touchscreen cockpit displays. Specially developed for the A350 XWB together with Thales, they will confer enhanced operational efficiencies, greater crew interaction, cockpit symmetry and smoother information management. On 18 December, China Eastern Airlines took delivery in Toulouse of the first A350 XWB equipped with the new devices. To date, around 20 airlines have selected the option for their new A350 XWBs.

Of the A350 XWB cockpit’s six large screens, three can now become touch capable: the two outer displays plus the lower-centre display. These displays now offer touchscreen capability for the pilots when presenting Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) applications. This new method of input complements the existing physical keyboard integrated into the retractable table in front of each pilot and also the keyboard and trackball “keyboard-cursor control unit” (KCCU) located on the centre console.

The new technology, which was recently certified for the A350 XWB by EASA in November, facilitates ‘pinch-zooming’ and panning gestures and will facilitate more flexibility and better interaction between both pilots, particularly during these scenarios: (a) before take-off (for computing take-off performance while entering data into the flight management system “FMS”); (b) in-flight/cruise (for accessing en-route navigation charts); and (c) during approach preparation (for consulting the terminal charts before entering FMS data). Moreover, during high workload phases of flight, the touchscreen capability reduces the need for pilots to make multiple cursor inputs and avoids them having to flip between different displays when using the EFB applications collaboratively on the lower centre display.

Patrick Piedrafita, Head of Airbus’ A350 XWB Programme said: “Airbus continues to set the industry trends in aircraft cockpit design with these new interactive touchscreen displays in the A350 XWB. With our partner Thales we are very proud to bring this technology to our customers, to enhance their aircrews’ operations.”

The A350 XWB features the latest aerodynamic design, a carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these features translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency with a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions. By the end of November, the A350 XWB Family had received 959 firm orders from 51 customers.

And there is some truth to that – after all, the manufacturer’s main airport and assembly site are located in Toulouse, France (TLS). TLS is also home to the departure destination of many Airbus’ test flights, including the first one it ever has done, when the Airbus A300 took off on its maiden voyage into the skies in 1972.

At the same time, Airbus is a multi-national company in every sense of the word, as Europe is not the only continent where aircraft, named using the A3XX formula, are assembled and shipped off to customers. Plants in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada, Mobile, Alabama, United States and Tianjin, China are all the second home of Airbus.

However, what does each individual plant do and manufacture?

Airbus A300 and A310

The first Airbus aircraft that started it all, the A300 and its little brother, the A310, were assembled in Toulouse, France.

Different components had to be shipped or brought in using lorries, taking up too much time for the company to complete an aircraft. A solution was found to bring aircraft parts using another aircraft – a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser-based Aero Spacelines Super Guppy. From that point forward, Airbus brought in parts using three channels – air, road and water.

The starting point of the A300 parts was several locations across Europe:

Its wings were built in the United Kingdom, by a company called Hawker Siddeley. The aircraft’s aft and forward sections of the fuselage were constructed in Germany and the tail was constructed by engineers in Spain. General Electric provided the GE CF6, while Pratt & Whitney gave the PW JT9D and PW4000 engines as options to power the first Airbus aircraft. Both General Electric and Pratt & Whitney are located in the United States.

The A300 was completed in Airbus’ Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Toulouse, France.

Rest of the family

As time went on and the European aircraft manufacturer designed its next jet, the A320, its popularity amongst airlines pushed Airbus into opening a new FAL in Hamburg, Germany. The first aircraft that rolled out of the plant in Germany was Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN) 364 A321 in 1993 and was used as a testbed. In 1998, Airbus delivered the same MSN 364 frame to Onur Air, a Turkish operator that still flies the aircraft to this day, registered TC-ONS.

However, most of the final assembly is still based in Toulouse, France. Wide-body aircraft, namely the A330, A350 and A380 are completed in the French city. Narrow-body aircraft are assembled in Mobile (A220 and A320), Mirabel (A220) and Tianjin (A320) in addition to two plants in Europe, located in Toulouse and Hamburg.

ARTICLE: Airbus and China shake hands to increase A320 and A350 production

But production sites, where parts are made, are scattered across Europe. For example, in Germany, there are four different plants:

In Hamburg, in addition to the final assembly of the A320, the manufacturer also equips and completes A380 fuselage sections, including cabin furnishing and painting of the Super Jumbo. Rear fuselage sections of the A330 and A350 are also manufacturer and equipped in North Germany.

Bremen is one of the two plants responsible for wing design and manufacturing in Airbus’ eco-system. In the German city, high-lift systems for wings is designed and manufactured for all Airbus aircraft.

Stade is home to another Airbus factory, where vertical tailplanes for every product on the manufacturer’s list is produced. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) parts, like flaps or spoilers for such aircraft as the A320 or the A330 are also manufactured here, including pressure bulkheads for the A330 and A380 and the upper wing shell for the A350.

The last German site is Buxtehude, another city near Hamburg. The factory responsible for electronic communication and cabin management systems onboard the aircraft.

French factories

Nevertheless, France remains an Airbus stronghold. The engineering, design, various testing processes, including flight tests are located. Four more sites are scattered across the south European country:

In Toulouse, Airbus engineers and designs, tests structures, and conducts flight testing from the main facility in the city. The Beluga fleet is also based here. Another site in Toulouse, Saint-Eloy, produces engine pylons (parts that connect engines with the wings).

ARTICLE: EASA certifies Airbus BelugaXL

In Saint-Nazaire, in the west of France, the plant equips and tests front and center fuselage sections for every Airbus aircraft.

The Nantes factory produces and assembles center wing boxes for every jet in the family. The plant is also responsible for Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic parts that are used in structural assembly. Here, Airbus manufactures radomes that protect radars onboard the aircraft, ailerons for the A330 and the A380, air inlets for the A320neo, A350 and Airbus A380.

UK and Spanish sites

In the United Kingdom, Airbus has only two factories: one in Broughton, Wales, the other in Filton.

In Broughton, the site is responsible for the wings of the entire family of aircraft, from the A320 to the A380, including the manufacturing, assembly and equipping. Filton, meanwhile, designs and tests wings, landing gears and fuel systems.

Lastly, in Spain, there are three crucial manufacturing sites for the European company:

Getafe is responsible for the manufacturing of fuselages using metallic and advanced composite materials, building and testing horizontal tailplanes for all Airbus jets. In addition, the central Spain-based plant builds the rear fuselage, tail cone and main landing gear doors for the A380 and the rear fuselage of the A350.

Illescas, around half an hour by car south of Getafe, focuses on producing composite aeronautical components, especially large-scale and oddly shaped parts, like the lower cover of the A350’s wing. Furthermore, the site manufactures stabilizers, rudders and spars, sections of rear fuselage and landing gear parts for the Super Jumbo and some rear fuselage sections and internal skin of the wing of the A350.

The third site in Airbus’ Spanish division is in Puerto Real that is responsible for assembly of various moveable surfaces like the rudders and the spars for every aircraft built by the European manufacturer. Puerto Real also ships out large structural components, including the horizontal tail and the belly fairing of the A380 and the A350 XWB’s horizontal tailplane boxes.

Thus, this concludes the long list of manufacturing sites of Airbus. To sum up, Airbus commercial aircraft are manufactured in:

· Germany (four sites);

· France (four sites);

· United Kingdom (Broughton and Filton);

· Spain (Getafe, Illescas, Puerto Real)."
Chile's SKY orders 10 A321XLRs to expand its international footprint - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMi1jaGlsZXMtc2t5LW9yZGVycy0xMC1hMzIxeGxycy10by1leHBhbmQtaXRzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZm9vdHByaW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SKY, a Chilean-based ultra-low-cost carrier, has signed a Purchase Agreement with Airbus for 10 A321XLRs. The airline will expand its international route network with the new aircraft.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step in the A320neo/A321neo Family, meeting market requirements for increased range and payload in a single-aisle aircraft. The A321XLR will deliver an unprecedented narrow-body airliner range of up to 4,700nm, with 30% lower fuel consumption per seat compared with previous-generation competitor jets, allowing airlines to expand networks by making new longer routes economically viable.

“This new aircraft fleet will allow us to expand our offer of international and wide-ranging routes, always under our successful low cost model and its extremely convenient ticket prices. Now passengers can enjoy new and very attractive destinations on the most modern airplanes in the market,” said Holger Paulmann, CEO of SKY.

Arturo Barreira, President of Airbus Latin America, said: “We are delighted that SKY has selected the A321XLR to further expand its fleet of all Airbus aircraft. The A321XLR will allow SKY to offer its customers new destinations, such as direct flights from Santiago in Chile to Miami in the U.S.”

According to the latest Airbus Global Market Forecast (GMF), Latin America will need 2,700 new aircraft in the next 20 years, more than double today’s fleet. Passenger traffic in Latin America has doubled since 2002 and is expected to continue growing over the next two decades. Specifically in Chile, traffic is expected to increase from 0.89 trips per capita to 2.26 trips in 2038.

In parallel to the growing fleet, according to Airbus’ latest GMF, there will be a need for 47,550 new pilots and 64,160 technicians to be trained over the next 20 years in Latin America. To cover this necessity SKY also selected Airbus as its flight training provider, making the airline the launch customer for the new Airbus Chile Training Centre. The centre will offer flight crew training for Chilean pilots and will include a full-flight A320 simulator.

SKY has been an Airbus customer since 2010 and became an all-Airbus operator in 2013. The airline’s fleet of 23 A320 Family aircraft serves national and international routes connecting Chile to Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay.

Airbus has sold 1,200 aircraft, has a backlog of more than 600 and more than 700 in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, representing a 60% market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured nearly 70% of net orders in the region.

United Airlines orders 50 Airbus A321XLRs for transatlantic route expansion - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMi11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtb3JkZXJzLTUwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxycy1mb3ItdHJhbnNhdGxhbnRpYy1yb3V0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United Airlines has placed a firm order for 50 Airbus A321XLR aircraft as it begins to phase out older models and launches an expansion of transatlantic routes from its key U.S. hubs in Newark/New York and Washington, D.C. United plans to take delivery of the first A321XLR in 2024 and expects to begin international service with the aircraft in 2025.

“The new Airbus A321XLR aircraft is an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network,” said Andrew Nocella, United’s Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. “In addition to strengthening our ability to fly more efficiently, the A321XLR opens potential new destinations to further develop our route network and provide customers with more options to travel the globe.”

“We are delighted to be re-United with our friends in Chicago and thank them for their trust. The selection of the A321XLR by the leadership of United Airlines is a ringing endorsement of the range, payload, and fuel efficiency that Airbus incorporated into this state-of-the-art aircraft,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “The exceptional versatility and performance of the A321XLR enable new operational efficiencies that flow to the airline’s bottom line.”

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step in the A320neo/A321neo family of aircraft, meeting market requirements for increased range and payload in a single-aisle aircraft, and creating more value for the airlines by enabling economically viable service on longer routes than any comparable aircraft model. It will allow service from the U.S. East Coast to a much larger selection of European destinations.

The A321XLR will deliver an unprecedented narrow-body aircraft range of up to 4,700nm, with 30% lower fuel consumption per seat compared with previous-generation competitor jets. It will have a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 101 metric tonnes, while takeoff, climb, and flight performance will change little from the A321neo.

The A321XLR will be operated by the same crew, powered by the same engines and have the same cabin as the A321neo, with more than 90% commonality. Combining the A321neo’s two rear center fuel tanks into one adds fuel capacity and reduces structural weight. Other significant changes include structural reinforcements and modified landing gears for the increased MTOW, increased braking capability, higher tire speed, and additional flap and slat configurations.

With the Airbus Cabin Flex fuselage, the A321XLR will accommodate a variety of seating classes and configurations suitable for longer flights.

At the end of October 2019, the A320neo Family had accumulated more than 7,000 firm orders from over 110 customers worldwide.

German launch startup raises $17 million with help from Airbus Ventures and an ex-SpaceX employee - SpaceNews,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nZXJtYW4tbGF1bmNoLXN0YXJ0dXAtcmFpc2VzLTE3LW1pbGxpb24td2l0aC1oZWxwLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLXZlbnR1cmVzLWFuZC1hbi1leC1zcGFjZXgtZW1wbG95ZWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Isar Aerospace, a German startup developing a small launch vehicle, has raised $17 million in a Series A round led by Airbus Ventures and Earlybird Venture Capital.

Munich-based Isar Aerospace is developing Spectrum, a two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket designed to launch 1,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit.

One of the company’s advisers and investors is Bulent Altan, the co-chief executive of German laser communications startup Mynaric who worked at SpaceX from 2004 to 2014 and returned in 2016 for two-year stint working on SpaceX’s Starlink broadband constellation.

Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum is one of the bigger small launch vehicles under development, similar to Firefly Aerospace’s Alpha, which debuts next year, and Relativity Space’s Terran 1, which has a first launch in early 2021. Though it just formed last year, Isar Aerospace says it is developing Spectrum at an “unmatched speed,” with a first launch anticipated in late 2021.

“Space is becoming the new internet and its commercialization is in full swing,” Daniel Metzler, Isar Aerospace chief executive, said in a Dec. 10 news release. “This funding round enables us to progress substantially in our development of sustainable, environmentally-friendly launch vehicles and further deliver on our vision to make space access affordable for everyone.”

Isar Aerospace is one of around 150 small launch vehicles under development, to one degree or another, joining a frenzy of investment activity as companies seek business launching small satellites weighing tens or hundreds of kilograms. The company joins a growing number of German rocket ventures, which includes ArianeGroup-supplier OHB and HyImpulse Technologies, a 2018 spinoff from the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion.

Like SpaceX’s Falcon 9, Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum rocket features a cluster of nine first-stage engines and a single vacuum-optimized, second-stage engine. The second stage can complete multiple burns to place satellites in different locations, eliminating the need for kick stages, the company says.

In an interview, Metzler said Isar Aerospace likes the Falcon 9 engine configuration for its reliability, and that Spectrum, too, will be able to complete a mission even if one of its first-stage engines fails in flight. The second-stage engine will be capable of five reignitions to drop satellites off where needed, he said.

Alten, who also invested in Isar Aerospace’s multi-million-euro seed round last year, said the launch startup has been successful in differentiating itself by “targeting the right segment with solid engineering.”

“As such this investment decision was an easy one to make,” he said.

Metzler said Spectrum rockets will be lightweight while having extremely high combustion pressures to stand out from other launchers. Isar Aerospace is targeting launch prices below 15,000 euros per kilogram, he said, with the eventual goal of reaching below $10,000 per kilogram, he said.

Metzler said Isar Aerospace has selected a launch site in mainland Europe, and is in contact with several others to support missions needing different inclinations. Having a European launch site should give the company an advantage with European customers who want to avoid spending time and money exporting their spacecraft to other countries, he said.

Metzler said Isar Aerospace would like to reach a launch rate of 15 per year, but can break even with just three to four. He said the company is open to making Spectrum’s first stage reusable, but is for now focused on an expendable design.

Isar Aerospace’s $17 million Series A will fund the 30-person company through to a full-duration engine hot-fire, Metzler said, and will enable the startup to double in size in the coming months. He declined to say how much the company has raised to date.

European tech investors Vito Ventures, UVC Partners and Apeiron Investment Group participated in Isar Aerospace’s seed round and $17 million Series A.

Metzler and Isar Aerospace’s other co-founders, Josef Fleischmann and Markus Brandl, studied at the Technical University of Munich and have backgrounds in aerospace engineering.

Mathieu Costes, Airbus Ventures partner, said the firm’s investment in Isar Aerospace is its first in Germany.

“Together with our investment round co-leader Earlybird and under the continuing guidance of Bulent Altan, we’re pleased to help draw together the ecosystems of new space excellence in both Germany and in the wider Airbus universe,” he said.

Airbus Ventures has invested in several other space startups, including Internet of Things startup Astrocast, communications payload startup Cesium Astro, space situational awareness company LeoLabs, and ground communications startup InfoStellar.

Airbus Defence and Space also has a memorandum of understanding with Isar Aerospace for “multiple satellite constellation launches.”

Earlybird partner Hendrik Brandis said Isar Aerospace is the company’s first space sector investment."

Forging a new era of electric-powered air racing - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTEyLWZvcmdpbmctYS1uZXctZXJhLW9mLWVsZWN0cmljLXBvd2VyZWQtYWlyLXJhY2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Anew era of electric-powered air racing is on the horizon, according to Team Scramasaxe. This team of highly experienced pilots with a background in aerodynamics, propulsion and advanced robotics aims to play a key role in forging this exciting future thanks to Air Race E.

During the Early Middle Ages, the seax—“scramasaxe” in French—was a commonly used curved sword with a notched blade that famously appeared in the coat of arms of Essex and the former Middlesex. According to the legendary myth of “The Vase of Soissons,” the scramasaxe sword was instrumental in forging a new era. Eric de Barberin-Barberini—a pilot and expert in aerodynamics—has selected this fabled sword as the namesake for his team in the hopes that their future e-racer for Air Race E will help forge a new era of electric-powered air racing.

Once autonomy, endurance and affordability are achieved, I believe electric flight will revolutionise short-range transportation.

- Eric de Barberin-Barberini, Head of Team Scramasaxe

5 questions with Eric de Barberin-Barberini, Head of Team Scramasaxe

Q. Why did your team decide to enter Air Race E?

Since 2018, we have been working on preparing a plane for classic formula one air racing so we had already launched the design of a sports-class racer. But following the release of the Air Race E rules, we believed our project would be a good fit for the competition. The challenge of a championship race is also what we were looking for. So the decision to join was simply common sense!

Q. Can you give us some insight on the aircraft you’re currently working on? What is your approach?

We’re not looking for extreme solutions. We want a good-looking machine that can fly well during straights and turns. This requires a strong airframe with a high level of safety. For aerofoil calculations, we’re working to achieve a top speed of 500 Km/hr.

Q. What sets your team apart in this race?

We’re aviation enthusiasts above all—which is probably the case for most teams, too! We’re here to work hard and make it happen. We’re also passionate about airplanes, technology and competition, which is a must.

Q. For you, what is the most exciting aspect of the race?

Racing, of course! The speeds at which we will race will probably surpass even the best formula one race planes ever built.

Q. How important is electric flight to the future of aviation?

So far, we’re more in the experimental rather than the transitional phase on electric flight. Once autonomy, endurance and affordability are achieved, I believe electric flight will revolutionise short-range transportation.

Eric de Barberin-Barberini is head of Team Scramasaxe, a participating team in Air Race E, which will become the world’s first all-electric airplane race when it launches its inaugural series of international races in 2020. The demand for speed, performance and power management under the rigors of a competitive race environment provides the perfect platform for the development and promotion of cleaner, faster and more technologically advanced electric motors. Airbus is the Official Founding Partner of the series."

United Airlines' order for 50 new mid-range aircraft from Airbus not only hands the European giant a huge win, it exposes a gap in Boeing's portfolio exacerbated by the 737 MAX crisis.

""This is a big setback for Boeing,"" said Michel Merluzeau, aviation expert at Air Insight Research. ""It will mean a loss of revenues to its biggest rival.""

United's decision go with Airbus for the A321XLR single-aisle plane marks a shift for the US carrier, which had ordered single-aisle planes only from Boeing since its 2010 merger with Continental, according to Leeham's Scott Hamilton.

United said the A321XLR, which extends the flying range for a single-aisle plane, will replace older Boeing 757-200 planes that are being retired.

The US airline turned to Airbus because ""there are no aircraft currently offered by Boeing that can replace the 757,"" said a person familiar with the company's thinking.

United ""wanted narrow-body aircraft with long range to go from the East Coast (of the US) to Europe, and Boeing just doesn't have that right now.""

The omission in Boeing's slate partly reflects a ripple effect of the company's intense focus on the MAX, which has been grounded since March following two crashes that killed 346 people.

Interest in new plane

As a result of the MAX's problems, Boeing was forced to push back until 2020 a decision to launch a new model aircraft, or NMA, it has been discussing to service mid-range distances.

Airbus has benefited since launching its new plane, which gives carriers the chance to provide longer flights to mid-sized cities using a single-aisle plane that is cheaper to operate.

The A321XLR has capacity to fly up to 4,700 nautical miles in nine hours, a longer distance than Boeing's MAX, of which United owns 14 that have been affected by the grounding.

United has been eyeing flights from US airports in the New York and Washington areas towards secondary cities in Germany, France, Spain and Portugal.

Irrespective of the Airbus order, Boeing described its business with United as healthy.

""We are proud of our decades-long partnership with United Airlines and our team is focused on delivering on outstanding orders for nearly 200 new airplanes for United in the coming years,"" Boeing said.

But Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group said the middle market of aviation ""is the only really healthy segment of the jetliner market"" and that Boeing is in a ""very difficult"" position at the moment.

""There are doubts about Boeing's ability to develop a new product in this class quickly, given the MAX crisis,"" Aboulafia said.

More defections?

Delta Air Lines, which currently owns about 200 Boeing 757 and 767 planes, plans to invest billions of dollars in the next five years to modernize its fleet. The company has expressed interest in a Boeing option.

""Boeing has not even made a decision on whether they will launch the aircraft,"" Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said earlier this year. ""We hope they will. We are very interested in it.""

Merluzeau said the loss of a Delta order would be a setback, as would a defection by fellow US carrier Southwest Airlines, which is the biggest user of the MAX and has historically bought all its planes from Boeing.

""The NMA is an essential plane for Boeing's strategy,"" Merluzeau said. ""Were it not for the MAX crisis, there would be much more certainty about the NMA.""

The MAX crisis has weighed on Boeing throughout 2019, leaving it well behind its European rival in both orders and deliveries.

Airbus has a sharp advantage over Boeing in single-aisle planes and has also been making headway against Boeing with longer-range planes due to problems with the Boeing 777X, which is under development.

But its predecessor the all-electric twin-propeller aircraft E-Fan 1.0 can be credited for playing a key role in laying the groundwork for the next generation of zero-emission aircraft technology.

On 9 July 2015, the world of aviation witnessed a remarkable milestone. At the Lydd Airport on the south-east coast of England, a twin-propeller aircraft was preparing to embark on an important journey. Its destination? The Calais-Dunkerque Airport—just over 74 km away by air.

Airbus Group’s E-Fan technology demonstrator became the world’s first all-electric two engine aircraft taking off by its own power to successfully cross the Channel on 10 July 2015, some 106 years after Louis Blériot’s epic flight. Here landing in Calais.

Less than an hour later (36 minutes to be exact), the aircraft—known as E-Fan—landed safely in Calais, France. But the E-Fan was no ordinary aircraft: it was powered solely by lithium-ion batteries. As a result, the E-Fan became one of the first all-electric aircraft to successfully cross the English Channel. It also paved the way for the next generation of electric-powered and zero-emission aircraft technology at Airbus.

The original E-Fan has now been retired and is currently on display at the Aeroscopia Museum in Toulouse, France. But thanks to the lessons learned from the E-Fan 1.0 project, a new aircraft demonstrator has emerged: the E-Fan X. This hybrid-electric aircraft demonstrator is 30 times more powerful than its predecessor. With the E-Fan X, zero-emission flight takes a giant leap forward.

Qantas choses Airbus A350-1000 for world's longest flight - Business Insider,"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy10by1iZWNvbWUtcHJlZmVycmVkLXN1cHBsaWVyLWZvci1xYW50YXMtc3lkbmV5LWxvbmRvbi1mbGlnaHRzLTIwMTktMTLSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1iZWF0cy1ib2VpbmctdG8tYmVjb21lLXByZWZlcnJlZC1zdXBwbGllci1mb3ItcWFudGFzLXN5ZG5leS1sb25kb24tZmxpZ2h0cy0yMDE5LTEyP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Qantas Airways said on Friday is has chosen Airbus as preferred supplier for jets capable of the world's longest commercial flights from Sydney to New York and London, beating rival Boeing after a hard-fought contest.

The choice of up to 12 A350-1000 planes fitted with an extra fuel tank for flights of up to 21 hours cements Airbus as the leader in ultra-long haul flying globally at a time when Boeing is battling with delays on its rival 777X program and a broader corporate crisis following two deadly 737 Max crashes.

The Qantas flights would begin in the first half of 2023, but remain subject to reaching a pay deal with pilots, who would need to extend their duty times to around 23 hours to account for potential delays and switch between flying the A350 and the airline's current A330 fleet. A final decision on an order is expected in March, the airline said.

The extended duty schedules will also need to be approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Australia's primary aviation regulator. Qantas conducted test flights from New York and London this fall to collect data.

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline ""had a lot of confidence"" in the market for nonstop services from Sydney to London and to New York based on two years of flying nonstop from Perth to London, where it has achieved a 30% fare premium over one-stop rivals in premium classes and achieved NPS ratings above its network average.

""The A350 is a fantastic aircraft and the deal on the table with Airbus gives us the best possible combination of commercial terms, fuel efficiency, operating cost and customer experience,"" he said.

Singapore Airlines operates the world's current longest flight, nearly 19 hours from Singapore to New York, using an ultra-long range version of the smaller A350-900.

Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer thanked Qantas for its selection in a statement, while a Boeing spokesman said it was disappointed with the decision but looked forward to continuing its longstanding partnership with the airline.

Rico Merkert, a transport professor at the University of Sydney Business School, said the A350-1000 fit the Qantas brief well and was the safer choice, given Boeing has recently reported problems such as the grounding of the 737 Max, structural cracks in 737 NGs and a fuselage split in a stress test of its 777-9.

""The A350 just seems to be a much safer bet,"" he said. ""And safety is at the core of everything that Qantas does including its brand.""

In particular, the A350-1000 is already flying commercially, while the 777X has yet to take its first flight.

Airbus no longer provides list prices for aircraft, but based on its 2018 price list, the Qantas order could be worth up to $4.4 billion before heavy discounts that are standard for airline customers.

The selection of the A350-1000 will add to growing doubts over Boeing's plans to produce the 777-8 that it had proposed to Qantas for the mission.

Boeing had already said the entry into service for the plane, a smaller, longer-range version of the 777-9, would be delayed beyond 2022 but has declined to give a new date, saying it would be based on customer demand.

Customers Emirates and Qatar Airways have indicated they could switch orders for the 777-8 to the 777-9.

The 777-9 is due to enter service in 2021, following delays associated with its GE engines.

The Boeing spokesman said on Friday the manufacturer was focused on the development of the 777-9 and after that it would complete development of the 777-8, with the first delivery scheduled a few years after that."
Airbus Delivers First A350 With Touchscreen Cockpit - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8xMi8xOS9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtYTM1MC13aXRoLXRvdWNoc2NyZWVuLWNvY2twaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has delivered the first A350 with cockpit touchscreens to China Eastern Airlines. following European certification in November.

Airbus is offering airlines the option to adapt three displays in the A350-900 and A350-1000 to touchscreens, which will allow for fluid flow around the cockpit in an intuitive fashion.

Available to adapt are the two outermost displays, generally responsible for electronic flight bag information, and the lowest of the two central displays, which act as a multi-function display.

The new feature is available to airlines as an optional extra and presents enhanced operational efficiencies, greater crew interaction, cockpit symmetry and smoother information management. Airbus says they’ve secured around 20 customers for the feature.

“Airbus continues to set the industry trends in aircraft cockpit design with these new interactive touchscreen displays in the A350. With our partner Thales we are very proud to bring this technology to our customers, to enhance their aircrews’ operations.” Patrick Piedrafita, Head of Airbus’ A350 XWB Programme

Despite being a more fluid approach to data interaction, the feature does not replace the existing keyboard-cursor control unit (KCCU) found on the A350, as well as the A380.

Airbus A380 Keyboard Cursor Control Unit (A380-800 Flight Deck and System Briefing for Pilots – Issue 02 2005)

Airbus gained certification for the optional extra by the European Aviation Safety Agency in November, following extensive testing on their A350-1000 test platform.

Pilots flying A350s with touchscreen displays installed will be able to use common gestures found on phones and tablets, such as pinch-zooming and panning. Additionally, the touchscreen display allows both pilots to interact with the lower central display simultaneously; whereas with the KCCU, only one pilot at a time could interact with it when engaged with that specific display.

Airbus suggests that the touchscreens facilitate greater flexibility before takeoff, in-flight/cruise and during approach preparation. Included in their examples is the computing of performance data for various stages of flight, accessing charts, accessing en-route data and consulting arrival information to enter into the flight management system.

However, during turbulence, Airbus test pilot Jean-Michel Roy says to Flight Global that the KCCU may be more stable and comfortable to use.

Airbus has not indicated any plans to introduce the technology to other aircraft and notes that there is a certain level of retrofit ability for the A350. There are no plans in place to make this development a standard feature, it will be remaining as a customer option for now.

The specific aircraft delivered to China Eastern Airlines is an A350-900 featuring registration B-30CW. Powering the aircraft are two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines."

United Airlines signed an order with Airbus on Tuesday for 50 of the European aviation firm's A321XLR aircraft to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 757 jets.

The order was confirmed by United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella Tuesday evening.

United's order was a major hit from a US airline for Boeing, which has an new mid-sized airplane, or ""NMA,"" currently in development. The NMA, which is intended to offer a replacement to the 757, with a similar range and capacity, has faced development delays as Boeing scrambles to fix its troubled 737 Max family of jets.

The 737 Max has been grounded worldwide since March 2019, following the second of two fatal crashes within five months.

Although Nocella said that the Boeing NMA had been a contender to replace the 757s, the American plane maker's jet has yet to be announced. On a conference call with media, Nocella said that the airline had not ""shut the door on potentially ordering the NMA"" in the future, ""once Boeing further refines the mission capabilities and details of the NMA.""

""But that hasn't happened yet,"" he added.

United will take delivery of the new Airbus jets starting in 2024. The planes will primarily be based at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey and Dulles Airport in Washington, DC, flying trans-Atlantic routes.

Airbus announced the A321XLR at the Paris Air Show in June. The plane, which is expected to enter service in 2023, will have a range of 4,700 nautical miles — about 200 miles more than the 757.

As part of the agreement signed Tuesday, United also deferred the first delivery of its order for 45 larger Airbus A350 wide-body jets from 2022 to 2027. The deliveries will coincide with the expected retirement of United's first Boeing 777 jets, Nocella said.

United has about 165 jets from the current, shorter-range Airbus A320 family in service, according to Airfleets.net, in addition to nearly 350 Boeing 737 jets — including 14 grounded 737 Max 9 planes. Its international fleet is currently all Boeing, including 757, 767, 777, and 787 Dreamliner planes.

United does not have any current plans to replace its 767s, Nocella said. The airline is currently replacing the cabins of its 767 planes, a task it expects to complete within the next 18 months.

The 757 entered service in 1983 as a relatively large and long-range narrow-body jet. It's proven adept at serving US airlines on high-traffic trans-continental routes and certain routes from the east coast to Europe."

With loss of a previous strategic advantage, this disastrous year will be followed by a precarious 2020.

By Dominic Gates / The Seattle Times

SEATTLE — Since the second fatal 737 Max crash, in Ethiopia in March, and the subsequent worldwide grounding of the jet, Boeing — the company that built the Pacific Northwest’s manufacturing economy and made the region a global powerhouse of aerospace technology — has suffered a precipitous fall.

Ongoing investigations of the crashes have spotlighted the badly flawed design of the Max’s flight control system and a largely self-certifying oversight regime that failed to catch the flaws. Congressional investigators are combing internal Boeing documents for evidence of malpractice, and a Department of Justice probe means even a criminal indictment is not ruled out. The jetmaker’s stellar global reputation is badly tarnished.

Through it all, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at aviation consulting firm Teal Group, Boeing has displayed “an absence of leadership, an absence of strategy and an inability to communicate.”

The disastrous year will be followed by a precarious 2020: As Boeing’s new leaders struggle to recover control, they face crucial decisions about developing new airplanes while they cope with depleted financial resources, a distracted engineering corps and a loss of Boeing’s previous strategic advantage against rival Airbus. They’ll also face pressure to reverse a two-decadeslong decline in the company’s historic culture of engineering prowess, which many blame for the Max disaster.

Although newly ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg was an engineer, he stuck closely to the financial engineering playbook of his predecessor, Jim McNerney. Whistleblowers and leaked documents have raised damaging accusations that management drove too relentlessly to cut costs and deliver on schedule.

A former senior leader at Boeing, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, blamed the Max crisis on a “push away from engineering excellence, driven by cost-cutting.”

“All of us who care about Boeing, we want to learn from this and ensure it never happens again,” the former executive said. “We have to get back the engineering discipline and make it the No. 1 priority.”

Boeing’s proposed fix for the Max — making sure the flight control system that went haywire in the crashes has multiple redundancies — in concept is solid. In practice, it’s taking much longer than anticipated to ensure the software is bug-free and hides no pathways to another single-fault failure.

It looks like the grounding of the Max will stretch into a full year. Yet no serious industry analyst doubts that the Max eventually will fly again and that when it does, it will be a safe airplane.

Aboulafia believes Boeing must not only steady itself by fixing the Max and restarting production but then must follow up as soon as practical to secure its future by launching an all-new airplane.

Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at consulting firm Avitas, points to the recurring cycles in the aviation industry. Though both Airbus and Boeing have suffered major setbacks over the years, the two aerospace giants still divide the business in a powerful duopoly and neither can feed the demand for new jets alone.

He’s optimistic that despite the debacle of 2019, Boeing will reverse its fortunes.

“In the long run, aviation is not dead. Boeing is not dead,” Pilarski said. “Eventually, Boeing can recover its strategic position.”

Fall from grace

In fall 2018, Boeing was riding high, raking in cash from ever-accelerating 737 production and widely seen as having the upper hand strategically over Airbus.

Boeing’s Max had been launched late but was catching up on the Airbus A320neo, and in 2019 Boeing anticipated flying its new Everett-built 777X and launching an all-new “New Midmarket Airplane” (NMA) — a prospective 797.

Even after the October 2018 crash of Lion Air flight JT610, the stock kept climbing, until March, when CEO Muilenburg could boast that the share price had tripled during his tenure. But with the second crash and the worldwide grounding, Boeing’s dominant position swiftly crumbled. The stock is now down a quarter from its high.

Delivery and sales numbers show a stark divergence of fortune with rival Airbus.

Through November this year, Airbus had 718 net orders and delivered 725 aircraft, while Boeing booked just 56 net orders and delivered 345.

In the crucial single-aisle category, Airbus delivered 578 of its A320 family of planes and Boeing just 121 single-aisle 737s. About 400 more Maxes were built that cannot be delivered until regulators clear the jet.

With Boeing sales stalled, Airbus raked in orders for its largest single-aisle jet, the A321neo, and launched new versions with extra fuel tanks to offer significant extra range.

As a result, airlines are buying the A321neo for medium-range international flights, such as transatlantic routes. That’s the heart of the mid-size, midrange market Boeing planned to target with its NMA, a plane carrying 220 to 270 passengers up to 5,700 miles.

The economics of the A321neo are forcing a shift away from larger, twin-aisle jets, which are much more expensive to buy and to operate. The jet’s order backlog has swelled to more than 3,200 airplanes as “the middle market has gotten way bigger than anyone expected,” said Aboulafia.

But at Boeing, any new airplane remains just an idea.

And the new 777X, delayed by engine-development problems, won’t fly until sometime in 2020.

Stan Sorscher, a retired Boeing engineer and longtime policy analyst with Boeing’s white-collar union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), describes a shift at Boeing over the past two decades from an engineering culture that strove for quality, high performance and problem-solving during development of a new airplane to one focused narrowly on cost-cutting.

This deliberate strategy from the very top of the company led to massive, ill-thought-out outsourcing and the discarding of engineering talent as work was moved out of the Puget Sound region.

Sorscher said that has led to major failures on Boeing’s latest two major airplane development programs — first the heavily outsourced 787 Dreamliner and then the minimally upgraded 737 Max. Both planes had to be grounded over safety issues.

Sorscher said Boeing had built up a superb engineering culture through building new planes every 10 years or so and passing on the knowledge through generations of engineers, but “we’ve now had two decades of workers who have not had the experience of going through a good, high-performance development program.”

Boeing at bay

As 2019 ends, Boeing is paralyzed by the Max crisis.

After months of optimistic declarations that the Max fix was close to approval, the FAA pricked that bubble in December, when FAA boss Steve Dickson told Muilenburg to get real. In response, Boeing finally announced a complete halt to the 737 Max assembly line in Renton until further notice. The board fired Muilenburg shortly after and appointed company Chairman Dave Calhoun to take over as CEO.

“Right now, there is a fire and they have to put it out,” said Pilarski, of Avitas.

Now Boeing must wait for FAA clearance while it braces for compensation negotiations with suppliers and airline customers. Its leverage is limited: Boeing needs suppliers to maintain capacity to restart and ramp up production again. It needs airlines to keep their Max orders.

Yet Boeing faces hostility from all quarters.

It had already alienated many suppliers long before the crashes as it relentlessly pressed them to lower their prices.

Major supplier Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, kept things running well by maintaining a production rate of 52 fuselages per month, even when Boeing cut its rate to 42 jets per month. The Renton shutdown forced Spirit to halt production completely.

Boeing’s airline customers, strung along for months, have lost patience. U.S. pilot unions have displayed open anger at Boeing.

United Airlines, tired of reassessing its schedule every month, pulled the Max from the schedule until June and said it expects to have to cancel more than 13,800 flights for the months of December through to June.

“Boeing has no friends anywhere,” said the former senior company leader.

On top of this, when the FAA finally gives the Max the OK to fly — late February or early March is the new target — it will be a daunting logistical challenge to restart the global supply chain and perform the maintenance needed to get the backlog of parked airplanes back in the air and delivered.

Even assuming the FAA’s approval doesn’t slip further, some of the parked jets may remain undelivered through next year. It could be 2022 before Boeing’s Renton plant is back to normal.

The future

Aboulafia, of the Teal Group, worries that the Max crisis will leave Boeing incapable of taking steps essential to its future, in particular responding to the new market demand for mid-size, midrange, single-aisle planes for international routes — jets like the Airbus A321neo.

He says “an arms race” by airlines to re-equip their fleets with these new airplanes is already under way. This month, United Airlines said it will buy 50 new A321XLRs, the extra-long-range version, to replace its aging Boeing 757 fleet.

“This is exactly the moment that Boeing needs to invest in its future,” said Aboulafia. “There will be a wave to catch. People want a new jetliner. You prepare for the wave and you catch it.”

He believes Boeing should drop the twin-aisle NMA concept and instead go for a replacement to the Max that skews toward the larger end of the single-aisle segment, the A321neo’s size.

Without the crashes, he thinks Boeing could have “turned on a dime” to pivot toward that idea. Now, with cash squeezed and debt mounting, he fears the Boeing board won’t make the necessary investment and will lose that market completely to Airbus.

Yet the best Boeing strategy is not obvious.

Pilarksi agrees that Boeing needs to catch that next wave. But he still sees the NMA concept as Boeing’s best answer to the A321neo. The NMA plan includes new, innovative production technology that he thinks Boeing should apply to a Max replacement, only some years later.

Whatever strategy is chosen, he said that as it emerges from the Max crisis, Boeing needs to “tell the market that it is not out of business.”

“They need a moonshot,” said Pilarski. “They better start working on it. I’m sure they are.”

Sorscher, the former Boeing and SPEEA analyst, said Boeing won’t succeed at that next new airplane unless its leaders can reassert legacy engineering standards.

“The cost-cutting business model is OK for mature products that don’t involve innovation and risk,” he said. But whatever next new airplane Boeing develops, he believes it must restore its “problem-solving, high-performance engineering culture.”

Sometime in the new year, Boeing hopes for its first good-news event in many months: the long-delayed first flight of the new 777X, with its massive composite wings.

In late January, Boeing’s new leadership will reveal the latest tally of the cost of the Max grounding, updating the $9.2 billion estimate through October.

The rest of the year is likely to be a long slog, getting the Max program restarted and slowly ramping back up again. No one can yet foresee the long-term impact."

United Airlines said Tuesday it had ordered 50 Airbus A321XLR aircraft, worth an estimated $6.5 billion, to replace an existing fleet of aging Boeings.

The new Airbus planes, to be delivered starting 2024, will allow United to retire its Boeing 757-200s, the company said.

The Airbus order is the latest blow to the American manufacturer, already deeply mired in the crisis surrounding its 737 MAX, which has been grounded worldwide after two crashes that resulted in 346 deaths.

Boeing has no new aircraft to compete with the Airbus A321XLR in the mid-market range.

Airbus launched the A321XLR only this year, at the Paris Air Show in June.

The single-aisle aircraft's range is 15 percent above that of its predecessor, the A321LR, making it a cost-effective alternative to long-haul wide-body planes.

It's larger fuel tanks allow it to cover up to 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) in nine hours—significantly more than the Boeing 737 MAX.

United said it intends to use the new aircraft to serve additional European destinations from US East Coast hubs in Newark/New York and Washington.

Gap in Boeing products

The airline turned to Airbus for the purchase because Boeing does not have an aircraft in the mid-market range, a source close to the matter told AFP on condition of anonymity.

""There are no aircraft currently offered by Boeing that can replace the 757,"" the source said, adding that negotiations between Airbus and United began several months ago.

Boeing, which is currently focused on returning its MAX aircraft to the sky, has already postponed until next year the possible announcement of a new model aircraft (NMA) intended to replace the 757 and 767.

The manufacturer recently presented the design to various airlines, including United, industrial sources told AFP.

Boeing still aims to have the NMA enter service in 2025, the sources said.

""We will take a close look at this aircraft,"" said Andrew Nocella, United chief commercial officer, during a call with reporters.

He added that United has not ruled out the possibility of buying the NMA should Boeing build it.

United's international fleet is made up mainly of Boeing models: the 757, 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner. The airline also has 14 737 MAX planes, which are currently grounded.

When contacted by AFP for comment, Boeing—which now lags Airbus in terms of both orders and deliveries—did not respond immediately.

Airbus decided to no longer publish the catalog prices for its aircraft beginning in 2019. However, the A321XLR is a long-range version of the A321, whose unit value was $129.5 million in 2018.

United has meanwhile postponed receipt of its first 45 Airbus A350 long-haul aircraft by five years.

The company, which ordered the planes in 2017, said it now plans to have them delivered in 2027 instead of 2022.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers significant fuel efficiency and widebody passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft. With an order book of 530 aircraft as of the end of November 2019, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100-to-150-seat aircraft market, estimated to represent 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

ICC must investigate arms companies linked to Yemen war crimes allegations - amnesty.org,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtbmVzdHkub3JnL2VuL2xhdGVzdC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlLzIwMTkvMTIvaWNjLWludmVzdGlnYXRlLWFybXMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXllbWVuLXdhci1jcmltZXMtYWxsZWdhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) must investigate the role of executives of European arms companies and licensing officials in violations of international humanitarian law that could amount to war crimes in Yemen, Amnesty International said today, as it joined the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) in an official request to the ICC.

The ECCHR, supported by five NGOs, has submitted a 300-page Communication and supporting evidence to the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP), calling on the ICC to investigate whether high-ranking officials, from both European companies and governments, could bear criminal responsibility for supplying arms used by members of the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led Coalition in potential war crimes in Yemen. It requests an investigation into their potential complicity in 26 specific airstrikes which unlawfully killed or injured civilians, and destroyed or damaged schools, hospitals and other protected objects.

“An ICC investigation would be an historic step towards holding arms company executives accountable for their business decisions. The reality is that everybody involved in selling weapons to the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led Coalition bears some responsibility for how those weapons are used. This includes company executives as well as government officials,” said Patrick Wilcken, Arms Control Researcher at Amnesty International.

“The ICC Prosecutor can send a clear message that it will hold corporate actors to account if they are involved in the most serious crimes.”

Despite mountains of evidence of serious violations in Yemen built up over nearly five years of the conflict, some European states have continued to export to members of the Coalition, which has bombed schools, houses and hospitals. These exports are a flagrant violation of the international Arms Trade Treaty, as well as European and domestic laws.

Any company executive can read a newspaper and understand that the human rights risk assessments of some European governments have failed catastrophically Patrick Wilcken, Arms Control Researcher

Governments are responsible for approving export licences, and many arms companies argue this exempts them from responsibility. But government approval does not absolve company executives from discharging their own reponsibilities to respect human rights across their business operations, including by not exporting weapons that risk being used to commit crimes under international law.

This excuse is especially weak when governments issuing licences are themselves being challenged over their decisions to export weapons which risk being used in possible war crimes and other violations.

“Any company executive can read a newspaper and understand that the human rights risk assessments of some European governments have failed catastrophically,” said Patrick Wilcken.

“Company executives have had ample time and access to plenty of reliable information to reassess their decisions to supply the Coalition in the light of the horrific events in Yemen. Hiding behind flawed government decision-making is not good enough – now they could face criminal charges before an international criminal court.”

The Communication focuses on the role of the following companies: Airbus Defence and Space S.A.(Spain), Airbus Defence and Space GmbH (Germany), BAE Systems Plc. (UK), Dassault Aviation S.A. (France), Leonardo S.p.A. (Italy), MBDA UK Ldt. (UK), MBDA France S.A.S. (France), Raytheon Systems Ltd. (UK), Rheinmetall AG (Germany) through its subsidiary RWM Italia S.p.A. (Italy), and Thales France.

Background information

The ECCHR and its partners (Mwatana for Human Rights, Amnesty International, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), Centre Delàs and Rete Disarmo) are calling on the OTP to investigate the responsibility of high level corporate officers, as well as high-ranking government officials from arms export licensing authorities, for their potential complicity in these alleged crimes under international law.

The ECCHR Communication focuses on companies from Spain, Germany, France, Italy and the UK, the biggest European exporters of arms to the Coalition. It provides factual information on 26 air strikes – on residential buildings, schools, hospitals, a museum and world heritage sites – which may amount to war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

The ICC may exercise its criminal competence over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in any territory subject to the jurisdiction of a state party (all EU states are parties to the Rome Statute) or over their nationals, wherever crimes are committed."

Airbus harnesses automation to boost fuselage production - Assembly Magazine,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzc2VtYmx5bWFnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy85NTM0MC1haXJidXMtaGFybmVzc2VzLWF1dG9tYXRpb24tdG8tYm9vc3QtZnVzZWxhZ2UtcHJvZHVjdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Automated assembly lines have been the backbone of the automotive industry for decades. Robots are widely used to rivet and weld car bodies. But, in the aerospace sector, automation is more elusive when it comes to building fuselages and wings for commercial aircraft.

Traditionally, the process of producing airframes is a manual task that uses fixed gantries and other types of large monument machines. The intricate process of drilling, countersinking and riveting tubular structures has proven difficult to automate.

That’s because there are several key differences between the auto industry and the commercial aerospace sector. Tolerances are much higher in aerospace applications, and the average subassembly is larger and heavier. Production volumes in aerospace are also much smaller than in the auto industry, while the life expectancy of the products being produced is much higher.

Boeing engineers have struggled to adapt robots for fuselage assembly tasks. After investing millions of dollars to automate its 777X wide-body jetliner production line, the aerospace giant has just pulled the plug on the project. Boeing will use humans to manually insert and tighten fasteners (robots will still do the drilling) because they’re proven to be “more reliable, requiring…less rework.”

“Automation certainly has its place, but it’s not necessarily a guaranteed cost reducer or efficiency improver in the aerospace industry,” says Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. “It all depends on volume. Automated assembly lines make sense for popular aircraft that have large backlogs.”

For instance, Airbus has orders for more than 6,000 copies of its A320 single-aisle jetliner. That’s one reason why it appears to be going in the opposite direction of Boeing when it comes to implementing automation.

Airbus recently unveiled an automated fuselage assembly line in Hamburg, Germany, that uses a variety of robots. The machines, housed in a building dubbed Hangar 245, are used to produce variants of its popular A320. It serves as a showcase for what Airbus believes is the future of aircraft assembly.

“With a special focus on manufacturing longer sections for the A321LR, the new facility features 20 robots, a new logistics concept, automated positioning by laser measurement and a digital data acquisition system,” says Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus. “These will further support [our] drive to improve both quality and efficiency, while bringing an enhanced level of digitalization to [our] production system.

“By embracing some of the latest technologies and processes, [we have] begun [our] journey to set new standards in [aircraft] production,” claims Schoellhorn.

The automated system will enable Airbus to increase productivity by 20 percent to 30 percent. For the initial section assembly, Airbus engineers rely on a modular, lightweight modular system produced by MTM Robotics. Flextrack consists of eight robots that drill and countersink 1,100 to 2,400 holes per longitudinal joint. The robots travel on a vacuum rail that’s attached to curved fuselage sections.

The next production step features 12 seven-axis robots supplied by KUKA. They are used to attach the center and aft fuselage sections with the tail. The robots drill, countersink, seal and insert 3,000 rivets per orbital pass.

Besides the use of robots, Airbus is also harnessing advanced technology for material handling applications to improve ergonomics and shorten lead times. The Hamburg factory features separate logistics and production levels, demand-oriented material replenishment and automated guided vehicles.

An overhead monorail conveyor system transports fuselage shells, while laser measurement tools positon the shells within 0.2 millimeter accuracy. Airbus engineers also created a digital twin of the state-of-the-art production line, which collects data for analysis via multiple sensors."
"Air France boosts Airbus A350 orders to replace A380s, A340s - The Points Guy","Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fpci1mcmFuY2UtYWlyYnVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France has ordered another 10 Airbus A350-900s to replace the Airbus A340 and A380 wide-bodies that it will retire over the next three years.

The deal brings the Paris-based carrier's commitments for the A350 to 38, including three already in its fleet, Air France said Wednesday. The airline configures its A350s with 324 seats, including 34 in business class, 24 in premium economy, and 266 in economy.

The order will allow Air France to remove the four remaining A340s in its fleet by the first quarter of 2021, and its 10 A380s by year-end 2022. At that point, the airline will operate just four wide-body families: the Airbus A330 and A350 and the Boeing 777 and 787.

""The rationalization and modernization of the Air France-KLM fleet is essential to improve its economic and operational performance,"" Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, said in a statement. A 25% reduction in fuel burn compared to previous generation aircraft was cited among economic benefits.

In July, Smith said Air France was in negotiations with Airbus and Boeing over an order for either the A330-900, A350-900 or 787-9 as a replacement for its A340s and A380s. The A350 was widely viewed as having a leg up due to the airline's existing orders for the type, and the group's earlier decision to consolidate its A350s at Air France and 787s at KLM.

School of Aviation and Transportation Technology flies first class - Purdue Polytechnic Institute - Purdue Polytechnic Institute,"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcG9seXRlY2huaWMucHVyZHVlLmVkdS9uZXdzcm9vbS9zY2hvb2wtb2YtYXZpYXRpb24tYW5kLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZmxpZXMtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As a matter of course, the faculty and staff of the Purdue Polytechnic Institute’s School of Aviation and Transportation Technology (SATT) consistently pursue grand challenges and industry needs. One of these challenges especially has the full attention of SATT’s head of school, Manoj Patankar.

“There is a global shortage of pilots, and Purdue is part of the solution,” said Patankar.

To remedy that pilot shortfall, Patankar has instituted a suite of advanced flight simulators, industry partnerships and an accelerated path to a professional flight degree.

Full-motion flight simulator



Purdue is the only university to offer Hawker simulator training.

Students can now experience a Hawker 900XP full-motion, Level D simulator, designed and manufactured by FlightSafety International, a world leader in aviation training and simulation. The Hawker is housed in Holleman-Niswonger Simulator Center, with the school’s new aircraft training devices and a number of part-task trainers.

Partnerships with Frontier and Airbus



Students graduate from Purdue “airline ready” to directly enter Airbus flight decks.

Thanks to an agreement between Purdue University, Frontier Airlines and Airbus, Purdue is the only university to offer A320 Type rating and utilize the latest Airbus tools, methodology, industry knowledge and technology.

Affiliate flight training



SATT partners with Purdue Global to expand professional flight program offerings

In a partnership with Purdue Global, SATT is creating an affiliate flight training program that will expand the reach of Purdue’s aviation program to more students in other locations around the country. General education and open elective courses will come from Purdue Global’s inventory, while students will earn academic credit for flight credentials obtained through affiliate flight schools. SATT will lend its expertise in curriculum development, faculty hiring, affiliate flight school selection, and accreditation by the Aviation Accreditation Board International.

Professional flight “Degree in 3” program



Students save time and money when they earn degrees in professional flight technology in three years

Students are taking advantage of Indiana’s summer weather to fly year-round, just like their professional pilot counterparts in the airline industry. Participating “Degree in 3” students save approximately $20,000 to $30,000 in tuition and living expenses, and enter the job market sooner, which brings the total value of SATT’s Degree in 3 program to more than $60,000.

Air Force cadet pilot training



Cadets earn private pilot certificates in summer training program

In 2018, SATT launched a partnership with the United States Air Force to teach high school students in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (AFJROTC) how to fly. In the first summer of the partnership, 20 cadets used an AFJROTC scholarship to earn their private pilot certificates at Purdue and take a giant first step toward a career in military or civilian aviation. In 2019, the number of cadets in the summer program increased to 52, and SATT intends to continue expansion of the program.

Electronic Purdue Bag



Each SATT student – including aeronautical engineering technology, aviation management, unmanned aerial systems and professional flight – receives a new cellular iPad, Apple Pencil and Logitech keyboard.

Dubbed an Electronic Purdue Bag (EPB) – a nod to the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) that replaced pilots’ paper-based flight information in the cockpit in the 1990s – the iPad systems provide Polytechnic aviation students with another competitive advantage by preparing them for the technologically advanced aviation industry, where most major airlines use iPad in the cockpit.

With their EPBs, students:

Access the latest technical documents, including operating manuals and navigational charts.

Generate multimedia safety reports on the spot.

Leverage immersive virtual and augmented reality tools.

Develop their own apps and customize their learning experience.

Connect with instructors via video.

Receive documentation required for classroom grading and professional certification.

New Piper Archer fleet



A new fleet of Piper Archers will continue student access to modern, reputable aircraft

A brand new fleet of Piper Archer aircraft, arriving in the spring of 2020, will further enhance SATT’s learning environment. The four-place, piston, single-engine Piper flight trainers will enable students to hone their instrument and cross-country flying skills. The exceptional and diversified SATT fleet already includes Piper Arrows, Piper Seminoles and an Embraer Phenom 100 Corporate Light Jet.

The forward-thinking actions taken by faculty and staff of SATT continue to prove why their partnerships and resources place Purdue’s aviation program – and its graduates – in a league of its own.

United orders 50 long-range Airbus jets to replace older Boeing planes - CNBC,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTIvMDMvdW5pdGVkLW9yZGVycy01MC1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWxvbmctcmFuZ2UtamV0cy10by1yZXBsYWNlLWJvZWluZy03NTdzLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOS8xMi8wMy91bml0ZWQtb3JkZXJzLTUwLW5ldy1haXJidXMtbG9uZy1yYW5nZS1qZXRzLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtYm9laW5nLTc1N3MuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United Airlines on Tuesday announced an order for 50 long-range Airbus jets, handing another victory from a U.S. airline to Boeing 's European rival.

The Chicago-based airline ordered 50 Airbus A321XLR planes to replace its aging Boeing 757-200s, and said that it will start to use the planes for international service in 2024.

The Chicago-based airline plans to fly the jets, single-aisle planes with extra-long range, to Europe from East Coast hubs Newark and Washington, it said in a release.

The carrier is the latest of several U.S. airlines to opt for the planes. JetBlue and American Airlines have both agreed to order some of the long-range single-aisle planes that Airbus is developing.

The decision comes as Boeing is hobbled by the crisis surrounding its 737 Max planes after two crashes, preventing it from dedicating more energy to designing an all-new middle-market plane.

Boeing ""currently does not have an aircraft equivalent to the A321XLR to meet our specific operational needs,"" United's chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella told reporters. He added that United is still open to looking at Boeing's new middle-market airplane but said Airbus' ""XLR is a bit smaller aircraft and better suited for these routes.""

Fuel-efficiency and increased range are enticing airlines to opt for smaller planes on longer routes as they seek to control their operating costs. United said Tuesday that it is also deferring orders of the larger Airbus A350 planes."

The deal includes a mix of Airbus A319, A320, and A321 models, the company said.

The purchase agreement finalizes an October provisional deal for the aircraft, when Spirit picked European planes despite Washington imposing tariffs on them.

Depending on the number of each variant of the A320 single-aisle family chosen, the deal could be worth $11 billion to $12 billion at the most recent 2018 Airbus list prices, but industry sources say such deals typically involve discounts of at least 50%.

Washington has imposed 10% tariffs on some of the planes Airbus offers to U.S. carriers, as part of a long-running transatlantic trade dispute over aircraft subsidies.

Spirit currently operates an all-Airbus fleet of 140 jets.

Aircraft are typically ordered several years in advance, meaning any planes ordered now would only be covered by tariffs in the event of an extended transatlantic tariff war. Airbus jets assembled at a plant in Alabama are not currently included."
Boeing NMA future doubted after United orders 50 Airbus A321XLRs - Flightglobal,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvYm9laW5nLW5tYS1mdXR1cmUtZG91YnRlZC1hZnRlci11bml0ZWQtb3JkZXJzLTUwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxycy8xMzU2OTYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The future of Boeing’s proposed New Mid-market Airplane (NMA) seems more uncertain than ever thanks to United Airlines’ recent order for Airbus’s competing A321XLR.

That deal left analysts split on the NMA, with some speculating the order suggests Boeing does not intend to offer its competing NMA.

“United’s purchase of the A321XLR indicates the door is closing on a new middle-market airplane launch from Boeing,” writes Bloomberg Intelligence in a 5 December research note. “Airbus sales of the A321XLR seem to doom the planned Boeing” airplane.

But another analyst, Michel Merluzeau with aerospace consultancy AIR, thinks the A321XLR’s success perfectly demonstrates why Boeing needs the NMA, and why it likely will green-light the project.

“I remain positive about NMA,” Merluzeau says. “All this makes a compelling case for a new Boeing” midsize aircraft.

“From a standpoint of product strategy, the absence of NMA is almost guaranteeing the loss of very important customers to the Boeing company,” he adds, citing Delta Air Lines in particular.

The NMA, which industry observers have tagged the “797”, has been an uncertain proposition since Boeing began discussing the concept several years ago.

As described, it would be a widebody with capacity for up to 270 passengers and 4,000-5,000nm (7,400-9,300km) range – fitting snugly between the 737 Max and 787, perfectly suited transatlantic flying.

In other words, it would replace aging 757s and 767s.

Boeing has long talked of bringing the NMA to market in the mid-2020s – just in time to satisfy airlines eager to replace older jets.

The three US legacy carriers – American Airlines, Delta and United – are thought to be among the biggest potential buyers, analysts have noted. Those airlines still operate 383 757s and 767s, according to Cirium fleets data.

American, Delta and United have each expressed interest in the NMA – particularly Delta – but none provided additional comments to FlightGlobal.

Until the second 737 Max crash in March, observers generally expected Boeing was close to launching the NMA.

But Max changed everything, forcing Boeing to first focus on returning the all-important narrowbody to service. The Max remains grounded.

“Our focus is on returning the 737 Max to service, however, we are still working through the NMA business case and, once we complete that work, we will make a decision on whether to offer the airplane,” Boeing tells FlightGlobal. “This is consistent with the gated process we’ve followed on previous development programmes.”

Airbus swoops in with A321XLR

With NMA paused, Airbus swept in, launching the A321XLR in June at the Paris air show. That aircraft will carry up to 244 seats, have 4,700nm range and enter service in 2023, Airbus has said.

The A321XLR has proved a fast seller, with Airbus having landed 450 orders and commitments.

Such demand proves how badly airlines want a midsize aircraft and signals a shift in airline preference from a 180-seat to a 200-plus-seat narrowbody, analysts say.

“We are witnessing a great repositioning of the product line,” says Merluzeau. “The heart of the market is the 321.”

American became an early customer, ordering 50 A321XLRs at Paris. But those orders, conversions of existing purchase rights, were not wholly unexpected.

Industry observers viewed United’s orders for 50 A321XLRs, announced on 3 December, as more ominous for the NMA. After all, United is a 737 Max customer and had no A320neo-family orders on Airbus’s books.

“United was seen as a likely NMA customer, so their A321neo order is hardly a promising sign” for the NMA, Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia wrote in a 6 December Forbes editorial. “I have doubts about [Boeing’s] proposed new midsized airplane.”

Aboulafia has long noted that widebodies have inherently higher manufacturing and per-seat operating costs than narrowbodies, which creates uncertainty about the NMA’s competitive advantage against the A321XLR.

Bloomberg’s research note says the American and United orders show that “two of the three largest passenger 757 operators have essentially switched” to Airbus.

Those analysts do not think Boeing will abandon the middle market. Rather, they suspect the Chicago airframer may leapfrog the NMA and move straight into developing a 737 replacement – perhaps starting with 757-sized variant

“Ultimately it might be the best way for Boeing to contest this segment,” Aboulafia writes.

Bloomberg says, “We believed all along that any NMA would be wrapped up in a redesigned narrowbody… A new Boeing narrowbody would likely be designed around a higher passenger capacity, perhaps centering on 200 seats.”

NMA still critical for Boeing

Merluzeau reads recent events different and thinks the NMA remains in Boeing’s future.

He doubts the airframer is ready to move beyond the 737 Max, noting Boeing needs Max sales and service revenue to fund its future.

Also, the NMA has long been viewed as “bridge” aircraft that would help Boeing modernise production ahead of launching a 737 replacement.

“I believe that is fundamentally still the case,” Merluzeau says. “The [NMA] is part of that transformation.”

He also insists A321XLRs will not address the entire mid-market. They can replace 757s, but A321XLRs will lack the 767’s passenger capacity and its ability to connect some mid- and western-US cities to Europe and Asia.

“Potentially we are dealing with an aircraft that puts more of Europe in range of the West Coast,” he says of the NMA.

That is why Merluzeau suspects Delta, the only legacy carrier that has not yet jumped into the A321XRL frenzy, may see the NMA as a winner.

Delta currently flies 77 767s and 127 757s, according to Cirium data. It deploys 767s to Europe from its Atlanta hub and from several western cities, and from the western US to Asia.

“The absence of NMA would mean possibly losing Delta,” Merluzeau says. “It is an aircraft that is going to more expensive, but it will become the standard in that middle of the market.”"

The boom in airplane orders is over for Boeing and Airbus - CNBC,"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTIvMTUvdGhlLWJvb20taW4tYWlycGxhbmUtb3JkZXJzLWlzLW92ZXItZm9yLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLmh0bWzSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOS8xMi8xNS90aGUtYm9vbS1pbi1haXJwbGFuZS1vcmRlcnMtaXMtb3Zlci1mb3ItYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are seen parked in an aerial photo at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, July 1, 2019.

Boeing and Airbus have reveled in a decade of airplane sales that outshined any other in history—but the period is ending on a sour note. The biggest shock by far has been the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max after two fatal crashes in a span of five months killed 346 people. The worldwide flight ban — now in its 10th month — forced Boeing to stop deliveries and has ground new orders of Boeing's best-selling jetliner nearly to a halt, draining cash and tarnishing the image of the biggest U.S. exporter.

watch now

Last week, Boeing abandoned its projection that regulators would lift the grounding by the end of the year after the Federal Aviation Administration chief chastised the manufacturer, saying he wanted to ""directly address the perception that some of Boeing's public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action."" ""Boeing reaffirmed with the FAA that safety is our top shared priority, and we are committed to addressing all of the FAA's questions as they assess Max certification and training requirements,"" Boeing said in a statement after its CEO and commercial airline chief met with the agency in Washington D.C. ""We will work with the FAA to support their requirements and their timeline as we work to safely return the Max to service in 2020."" The beleaguered plane traces back to an arms race between Boeing and Airbus to deliver as many fuel-efficient planes as quickly as possible to airlines eager to cash in on a boom in air travel. The companies also sought to respond to airlines' demands to cut fuel consumption with more efficient engines. Boeing rolled out what became the Max months after Airbus launched its new fuel-efficient model of its workhorse single-aisle jet, calling it the 320neo line. Boeing, based in Chicago, is now under scrutiny for failing to put in sufficient safeguards on the Max in the case of malfunctions.

But cracks in the rally of jetliner orders aren't limited to the Max crisis. Both manufacturers will enter the next decade amid slowing air traffic growth and trade wars. Demand growth for their higher-priced wide-body jets that can fly longer distances has slowed the most, as carriers opt for nimbler, fuel-saving planes that can fly travelers on ever-longer nonstop flights, a trend that helped kill the largest jetliner in the world, the Airbus A380. Demand for wide-body planes remains relatively weak amid some softness in international travel and a slump in cargo. ""The boom in orders is over,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, aerospace analyst at Jefferies.

In addition to cheap interest rates, wanderlust helped fuel the surge in orders over the last decade. On the heels of the financial crisis through last year, air travel demand grew at about twice the rate of the global economy. Airlines raced to fit more seats on their planes and flights have been flying fuller than ever. ""People of my generation wanted to generate goods, processions. People of today's generation are very much not of that mindset. They actually covet experiences,"" Delta Air Lines ' chief marketing and communications officer Tim Mapes said at an industry conference in August. ""Travel today is so much more accessible. It's all about the selfie shot in front of some exotic place with somebody that you care about."" Over the last 10 years Boeing and Airbus racked up orders for more than 20,000 jetliners, up 66% from the previous decade.

Orders peaked in the middle of the decade. Airlines were concerned about the high cost of fuel, their single biggest expense after labor, and pushed for fuel-saving options, but when prices cratered their needs became less urgent. There are also concerns about meeting demand. The two manufacturers are sold out on single-aisle planes until the middle of the coming decade and had already been struggling to keep up with demand. Aside from the airlines like Southwest and American that have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue because of the prolonged Boeing Max grounding, Airbus production delays have hit customers like JetBlue and Lufthansa. Boeing and Airbus had order backlogs that are worth more than $800 billion by the middle of the 2019, according to aerospace and defense analysis firm Teal Group. But those backlogs they have accumulated have helped send both companies' stock prices to record highs. ""The industry is probably on the other side the peak,"" said Ron Epstein, research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""The question is it going to be a soft landing or a hard landing ... and it looks like a soft landing."" Even after the first crash of the 737 Max, a Lion Air jet that went down shortly after takeoff from Jakarta in October 2018, Boeing's stock hit a record high earlier this year. Less than two weeks after the company's stock hit a record, another nearly-new 737 Max crashed, that time an Ethiopian Airlines flight headed to Nairobi from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.

Since then the stock has dropped 21%, wiping about $45 billion in market capitalization off the Dow component. The losses could have been even deeper if Boeing wasn't sitting on that backlog since many investors assume regulators will eventually allow the planes to fly again. Airbus' stock hit a record last month of 136.40 euros a share, the equivalent of $151.68.

Growth wanes

Growth in air travel demand has slipped globally. While demand in the U.S. — the world's largest aviation market — has held up, weakness on international routes and a slowing economic expansion has weighed on the overall numbers. The International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world's airlines earlier this month said ""traffic growth continues to be depressed compared to historical long-term growth levels, reflecting continued moderating economic activity in some key markets and sagging business confidence."" Still, their backlogs are robust and manufacturers expect demand to continue for decades to come. Boeing, for example, forecasts global commercial aircraft deliveries of 44,000 planes worth $6.8 trillion through 2038. But in the nearer term, both companies face an uncertain sales environment in the coming decade. They get paid the bulk of the price of the planes when they're delivered, setting them up for risks if there's a downturn. ""An order is not an order until the aircraft is delivered and paid for,"" said Rob Morris, global head of the consulting business at aviation analysis firm Cirium. ""In that context, a high backlog is bullish but the credit strength of that backlog is critical since the aircraft need to be delivered for the [manufacturer] to achieve the expected revenue."" Issues with larger planes are already hitting the manufacturers. Airbus earlier this year said it would shut its A380 program after about a decade, a brief lifespan for an aircraft, due to paltry demand. Boeing's issues with the Max have left it hamstrung from pursuing a plan to build an all-new aircraft to serve mid-range routes. The company in October announced it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliners, long-range twin-aisle planes to 12 a month from 14.

""If you're a manufacturer you kind of got addicted to growth,"" said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group. ""How do you explain to investors: 'It's okay. It'll be a plateau'?"""
Vahana has come to an end. But a new chapter at Airbus has just begun - sUAS News,"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 06:52:41 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1YXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE5LzEyL3ZhaGFuYS1oYXMtY29tZS10by1hbi1lbmQtYnV0LWEtbmV3LWNoYXB0ZXItYXQtYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1qdXN0LWJlZ3VuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Vahana has come to an end. But a new chapter at Airbus has just begun

How the lessons learned from Vahana will inspire the next generation of eVTOLs at Airbus.

Nearly four years after the Vahana concept was sketched on a napkin, the flagship programme that launched the urban air mobility initiative at Airbus has come to a close. Vahana’s key learnings are now providing Airbus Urban Mobility with invaluable insight on the design of its future urban air vehicle.

“It all started with a sketch on a napkin…” The Vahana story— when told by project team members—often starts this way. Some tell the story with a hint of wonder, others with a tinge of nostalgia. Indeed, Vahana is a legend in its own right. And it is not hard to see why: a design that looked pulled from a sci-fi movie has quietly transformed into a fully operational electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in only a few short years.

The early sceptics can be forgiven: 2016 was a different time. Back then, no one could have predicted that leveraging the sky to improve urban mobility was practical. And yet, urban air mobility is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Today, it is one of the most exciting and promising markets in aerospace. And the extraordinary progress of Vahana has undoubtedly played a key role in bringing this vision closer to reality.

Learnings from both aircraft—Vahana and CityAirbus—will be used to advance our relationship with regulators and to understand key technologies.

Zach Lovering, VP of UAM Systems, Airbus

But, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. For Vahana, that day has come. On 14 November 2019, the final page of the Vahana story was written at the Pendleton UAS Range in Oregon, USA. Here, Vahana took its final test flight to the cheers (and some tears) of all those who have closely contributed to its extraordinary development.



Now as the dust settles on Vahana’s final flight, the next chapter in urban air mobility at Airbus is already taking shape.

A rich reservoir of key learnings on eVTOL technologies

From the outset, Vahana was designed as a technical demonstrator project. In the R&D community, “technical demonstrators” are commonly used to test high-potential technologies and to support their transfer to real-world applications. In other words, Vahana was never intended to become a commercialised product—instead, the Vahana team based at Acubed in Silicon Valley was tasked with important objectives relating to eVTOL development.

Zach Lovering, VP of UAM Systems at Airbus and head of Vahana, highlights the programme’s three main objectives:

Designing a fully operational eVTOL vehicle : A sketch on a napkin is one thing, but proving the technical viability of the configuration is quite another. The project team pushed its idea of a tilt-wing configuration with a suitable battery-to-electric-motor solution to the limits. When Vahana took its first flight in 2018, the leap from concept to reality was a success.

When Vahana took its first flight in 2018, the leap from concept to reality was a success. Proving the viability of self-piloting technologies : Vahana was launched at a time when real-time detect-and-avoid capabilities on small aircraft were considered a pipedream. Today, Vahana is fully capable of autonomously detecting airborne and ground hazards. The project was thus instrumental in helping to de-risk core elements of autonomy for urban air mobility vehicles and gave rise to Wayfinder, an ambitious autonomous flight technology project at Acubed.

The project was thus instrumental in helping to de-risk core elements of autonomy for urban air mobility vehicles and gave rise to Wayfinder, an ambitious autonomous flight technology project at Acubed. Developing an eVTOL business case: What is the total operating cost of eVTOLs? How does it compare to traditional helicopters or taxis? What is the value for the community? How should they be certified? All of these questions need to be ironed out to create a compelling business case. And Vahana offers rich learnings in this respect.

The future is friendly for urban air mobility

Now that the Vahana programme has been completed, the project team is looking forward to applying the lessons learned to the future urban air vehicle at Airbus. And they will be in good company: the project team for CityAirbus—the second eVTOL demonstrator in the Airbus portfolio—will continue its flight test campaign throughout 2020 to be able to bring fresh insight to the concept development table.

“It’s bittersweet to see Vahana come to an end,” says Zach, who expressed his thoughts in a blog post. “But learnings from both aircraft—Vahana and CityAirbus—will be used to advance our relationship with regulators and to understand key technologies.”

Although precise timelines for the future vehicle are still to be determined, work on the new design has already begun. Airbus Urban Mobility is tasked with taking the lead on this front.

For the time being, one of the two Vahana “Alpha” aircraft will head to Acubed to act as inspiration for future ground-breaking projects. The other will make an appearance at the 2020 HAI Heliexpo in Anaheim, California."
Airbus Produces 100th A220 - AVweb,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9hdmlhdGlvbi1uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1wcm9kdWNlcy0xMDB0aC1hMjIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus announced that it has produced its 100th A220 aircraft, celebrating the achievement with a ceremony at its A220 program headquarters in Mirabel, Canada, last Friday. The aircraft, an A220-300, is slated to go to Latvia-based airline airBaltic. AirBaltic took delivery of its first A220-300 in November 2016 and currently operates a fleet of 20 of the aircraft.

“In an extremely competitive market, the aircraft’s unequalled fuel efficiency and excellent performance has been instrumental to airBaltic, which has an all-A220 fleet as the backbone of its new business plan,” said Airbus. “The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint.”

The Airbus A220 family, formerly the Bombardier C Series, includes the A220-100 and A220-300, which were designed for the 100- to 150-seat airline market. The A220 models are assembled at the company’s Mirabel facility and at a second assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. According to Airbus, it had received 530 firm orders for the A220 by the end of October 2019."

Tuesday, United Airlines placed an order for 50 Airbus A321XLR planes, with the first to be delivered in 2024.

The A321XLR is a single-aisle narrow-body airliner with a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles (about 5,400 miles). It uses 30-percent less fuel per seat when compared with some older jets.

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, said, ""The selection of the A321XLR by the leadership of United Airlines is a ringing endorsement of the range, payload, and fuel efficiency that Airbus incorporated into this state-of-the-art aircraft.""



United plans to use the new aircraft to replace older models that are being phased out.

WEAR asked Airbus Senior Manager for Communications Bob Cox if any of the new planes would be assembled at the Airbus facility in Mobile.

Cox said the manufacturing plans are still being worked out, but that it's ""almost certain"" many of the aircraft will be built in Mobile.

Andrew Nocella, United’s Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, said the Airbus A321XLR is"" an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network.""

United Turns to the Airbus A321XLR; Boeing Can't Compete – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMTkvMTIvMTIvdW5pdGVkLXR1cm5zLXRvLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMXhsci1ib2VpbmctY2FudC1jb21wZXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was only this summer when American announced an order for 50 A321XLRs. At the time, nobody seemed surprised. American is a customer of both Airbus and Boeing, and the A321XLR was the right airplane to fill the airline’s needs on long, thin routes that the 757 operates today. Now, United has done the exact same thing, placing an order for 50 A321XLRs. This time, it’s a somewhat different story.

United has been a staunch Boeing loyalist for many years. United hasn’t taken delivery of an Airbus from the factory since its last A320 rolled off the line in 2002. Yes, it has added a handful of second-hand A319s and A320s, but that is just an opportunistic way to grow the fleet for cheap. The only other Airbus order in the last 20 years has been for the A350, and that has become something of a joke. Here’s how that has gone:

December 2009 – United commits to an order for 25 A350-900s (pre-merger). Deliveries were expected between 2016 and 2019.

June 2013 – United converts those 25 A350s to A350-1000s and adds 10 more. Deliveries were pushed back to 2018.

September 2017 – United converts those 35 A350s back to A350-900s and adds 10 more. Deliveries were pushed back again to 2022.

December 2019 – United pushes first delivery back yet again to 2027.

Here we are a decade after the order was first made, and we’re still eight years away from an airplane being delivered. Even that seems highly suspect. I’d effectively consider this order dead except as a strategic weapon for United. And Airbus went along with it, since that last deferral was tied to the decision by United to order 50 A321XLRs.

Since United has had no interest in actually ordering AND taking delivery of a factory-fresh Airbus in decades, this order for the A321XLR is a big deal. While the current management team is likely more open to ordering from Airbus than in the past, it’s not clear that there was any option here. United needs the A321XLR since Boeing has absolutely nothing that can compete.

United has already ordered 100 of the similarly-sized 737 MAX 10s, but that airplane has big range limitations. The MAX 10 has a range of only 3,300nm while the A321XLR will be up around 4,700nm. Here’s why that matters to United:

Using Newark as a base, the darkest blue is the range of the MAX 10 while the medium blue is the additional range of the A321XLR. The MAX barely reaches Europe, and I would be surprised if it even lived up to this promised range since airplanes rarely do. Meanwhile the A321XLR can cover virtually all of Europe. That is incredibly important for an airline with hubs in Newark and at Washington/Dulles.

Remember, United has a substantial 757 operation from Newark and Dulles into Europe. United has said that this order will replace those airplanes, but it will also allow for big expansion.

Today, United has 13 757-200s which are used only to fly between Newark and the West Coast. (These are the pre-merger United airplanes.) Those will be replaced by 737 MAX 10s. Meanwhile, there are 40 757-200s that came from Continental and have more range. Those are the airplanes that serve Europe, and they’re the ones that will be replaced by the A321XLRs.

Here’s a look at all United’s current 757-200 scheduled routes for July 2020 via Diio by Cirium.

July 2020 United 757-200 Map via Diio by Cirium

The MAX 10 can do Hawai’i from the West Coast and it can run domestic flights. But those Europe routes are A321XLR or bust. With 50 of those on order, United can easily replace the 40 757-200s that cross the Pond and expand much deeper into Europe. Imagine routes that United can’t justify serving today because the smallest airplane it has with the range is a 767. Though I don’t know the list, I have to imagine that something like Dulles to Berlin or Newark to Helsinki might be possible. And don’t forget other continents. Newark to Dakar? Maybe down into Latin America from there or Houston? There is a lot that these airplanes can do.

Boeing has to simply sit on the sideline and watch. The MAX 10 doesn’t have the range. Talk of a new “middle of the market” aircraft has fallen flat. It’s unclear if that airplane will ever be built as the most likely customers continue to place orders with Airbus instead of waiting longer for Boeing to create something compelling. Boeing has plenty of other more pressing issues, and it may eventually decide that this isn’t where it needs to be spending its time.

Even if that’s not the case, Boeing finds itself falling further and further behind. It was one thing for Airbus to get regular-customer American on the board for the A321XLR. But getting United? That’s an even bigger victory."
Could Airbus Buy SR Technics? - Aviation Week,"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vY291bGQtYWlyYnVzLWJ1eS1zci10ZWNobmljc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A sale of SR Technics by China’s embattled HNA Group has been on the cards for much of this year, but in an interesting new development Bloomberg has reported that Airbus is among the potential bidders for the MRO provider.

While the European OEM has not commented on the story, if true it would mark a rare foray into direct ownership of an MRO provider by an aircraft OEM – not to mention a concrete demonstration of one’s efforts to boost aftermarket revenue.

Airbus’s services revenue reached €2.5 billion ($2.8 billion) in the first nine months of this year, 17% higher than in the year-ago period.

Rival manufacturer Boeing reported almost $4.7 billion of services revenue for the third quarter alone, although this included a hefty chunk of military work.

At Airbus, services’ share of total commercial revenues in the nine months to Sept. 30 was stable at 7%.

HNA acquired an 80% stake in SR Technics in 2016 at the zenith of a multi-sector buying spree that has since unraveled, forcing it to sell assets and even threatening the finances of its core Hainan Airlines operation.

Last week, eight Chinese banks extended a $568 million loan to Hainan Airlines, although certain analysts have suggested that this is insufficient to shore up its finances, let alone those of its other airline affiliates, which are in even worse financial straits.

To that end, a sale of SR Technics which could fetch up to $1 billion would provide some much-needed liquidity.

Other potential bidders reportedly include the Hainan government and rival MRO providers.

Of course, no sale might also happen; as with most dealings of HNA, whose companies are owned an traded via a labyrinthine network of affiliates, subsidiaries, endowments and cross-shareholdings, the future of SR Technics within the group remains opaque."

"As Boeing Halts Max Output, Airbus Can't Build Jets Fast Enough - American Journal of Transportation","Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqb3QuY29tL25ld3MvYXMtYm9laW5nLWhhbHRzLW1heC1vdXRwdXQtYWlyYnVzLWNhbmF0LWJ1aWxkLWpldHMtZmFzdC1lbm91Z2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: Siddharth Philip | Dec 17 2019 at 10:14 AM | Air Cargo

As Boeing Co. halts production of its beleaguered 737 Max, global rival Airbus SE is grappling with a very different problem: speeding output of its rival narrow-body.

So-called “stretch” versions of the A320neo jet have sparked an order frenzy as airlines snap them up to replace costly twin-aisle planes on longer routes or cram in seats on shorter legs. But to achieve that flexibility Airbus has had to offer a wide range of cabin layouts that’s made assembly far more complex.

Slower build rates on the top-priced A321 variant mean that the European company needs to lift deliveries 75% this month compared with November to meet full-year production targets. It’s a vital challenge for Airbus—not only to consolidate its advantage over a flailing Boeing, but also to maximize returns from its most expensive narrow-bodies as demand peaks for even more-lucrative wide-body models.

“The A321 matters because as a stretch it should be by far the highest-margin aircraft of the Airbus narrow-bodies,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst at Agency Partners in London. The increased popularity of single-aisle planes on longer routes could mean they come to account for three-quarters of the total value of planes delivered in a given year, up from 50% previously, he added.

Airbus is targeting 860 deliveries across its airliner range for 2019, 20 fewer than the initial goal after the company acknowledged in October that its plants were behind schedule. Each missed jet will wipe at least 10 million euros ($11 million) off profit, Citi Research analyst Charles Armitage estimates.

While that’s a big hit, the delays could have wider ramifications—potentially stymieing future orders for a model that’s already booked out until 2024 with a backlog of 6,193 planes.

Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury has already said that A320-series output won’t properly be back on track until 2021, by which time production is due to reach 63 aircraft a month from 60 now.

Responding to questions from Bloomberg, Airbus said meeting the 135-plane December goal will be “challenging” but that the company is counting on jets that were already close to complete at the end of last month to swell handovers.

Demand for the A321neo planes has been “much higher than we originally anticipated,” a spokesman said, with a jet that once accounted for just 10% of A320-series demand now constituting 40% of sales and growing.

Orders got a further shot in the arm with the launch of an extra-long-range or XLR upgrade in June. United Airlines this month agreed to buy 50 of the planes, joining a customer base that also includes American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp.

To be sure, Airbus has faced a year-end race to hit delivery targets before, with assembly-line staff working through the holidays to hand over 127 jets in both December 2018 and 2017.

Those delays were focused on glitches with jet engines at suppliers. This December’s challenge is a different one, concerning the pace of cabin installation at Airbus’s A321 assembly site in Hamburg.

At the heart of the holdups is the Airbus Cabin Flex option that allows airlines to choose from A321 layouts ranging from a high-density economy configuration accommodating 240 people at India’s Indigo to 102 seats in four classes—including flat-bed berths, as American has specified.

The combinations require changes to the location, layout and number of emergency exits and even galleys and toilets. Airbus says it has hired over 1,000 people for the Hamburg line and added 20 robots to improve efficiency.

The long-range A321LR entered service a year ago, while the XLR, launched at the Paris Air Show in June, is set for its first delivery in 2023. The new plane, with a range of 4,700 nautical miles, has a list price of more than $140 million, compared with $108 million for the baseline A320neo.

Airbus’s long-term fix should come in the form of a new assembly line, likely to be located on the site of an A380 superjumbo facility in Toulouse, France, that’s due to be closed in 2021 as the double-decker ends production. The site will most likely be devoted to the A321neo and its variants in order to ease the pressure on its Hamburg plant."
Airbus drives OPTIMA photonics payload technology to next level - Airbus,"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMi1haXJidXMtZHJpdmVzLW9wdGltYS1waG90b25pY3MtcGF5bG9hZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLW5leHQtbGV2ZWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stevenage, 13 December 2019 – Airbus has validated and demonstrated photonic satellite payload technology to Technology Readiness Level 6, the last level before prototype in orbit, through the OPTIMA Horizon 2020 project. This proof of concept demonstrator brings the use of photonic payloads in telecommunications satellites one step closer. Photonic payloads have the potential to revolutionise the design, capacity and capability of future generations of telecommunications satellites.

Photonic payloads will use light to transfer the signals throughout the spacecraft, replacing current radio frequency (RF) technologies, allowing for the development of more efficient and powerful satellites which are able to meet the increasing complexity and sophistication required by customers.

OPTIMA takes into account the future evolution of telecom satellite payloads and inter-satellite links which are expected to enter the terabit per second and multi-Gb/s ""era"" in the 2020 horizon.

OPTIMA technology enables the design of such payloads with significant reduction of mass, volume and power consumption against full microwave approaches, whereas Photonic Integrated Circuits enable low overall production and integration costs.

The technology developed in OPTIMA will see the sustained entry of photonics into telecom satellite payloads. This will enable easier capacity upgrades of multi-beam telecommunication satellites and also leverage the R&D investment to address next generation coherent inter-satellite links with fully integrated and qualified components.

Javad Anzalchi, Airbus project manager and technical lead said: “By bringing together industry partners, we have managed to develop, demonstrate, and raise the technology readiness level of photonics for applications in space. Using the low power equipments developed in OPTIMA, enables us to achieve high capacity payloads and multi-Gb/s inter-satellite links with considerable savings in power, mass and footprint.”

The OPTIMA project, led by Airbus in Stevenage and part of Horizon 2020 funded by the European Commission, comprises specialist partners from across Europe, including: DAS Photonics (Spain), CORDON Electronics (Italy), SODERN (France), Huber+Suhner Polatis (UK) and IMEC (Belgium).

American Magic flying towards the America's Cup with Airbus as Innovation Partner - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTEyLWFtZXJpY2FuLW1hZ2ljLWZseWluZy10b3dhcmRzLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhcy1jdXAtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtYXMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus innovation is a special ingredient in U.S. team American Magic’s ongoing quest for sailing’s oldest trophy – the America’s Cup – with the company providing out-of-the-box thinking and technical support on site.

American Magic – which represents the New York Yacht Club – sought out Airbus to optimise the performance of its racing yacht’s design process, particularly looking to leverage the aerospace industry global pioneer’s expertise in engineering and simulation.

The America’s Cup yachts (AC75) for this competition are a totally new breed of 75-foot foiling (flying) mono hulls. The project management demands to build the AC75-class vessel are staggering, with both partners Airbus and American Magic excelling in such complex tasks.

Airbus is the proud to be the Innovation Partner for the American Magic team

This is where the magic happens show more show less Airbus and the U.S. American Magic team are working side-by-side to capture the oldest trophy in competitive sailing and modern sports (the America’s Cup was born in 1851).

Few sports competitions offer such fascinating areas where open collaboration might yield interesting results, and none are quite like the America’s Cup. It is effectively a challenge to competitors’ capacity to conduct technological innovation under demanding time, cost and human resource constraints.

Airbus engineers like Laurent Dalbies and Lilian Ronceray were up to the challenge, moving outside of their comfort zone (sometimes literally when collocated with other American Magic team members in the U.S.) to help bring aircraft technologies into the world of competitive sailing.

Q&A with Laurent Dalbies and Lilian Ronceray

Airbus engineers Laurent Dalbies and Llilian Ronceray (left to right) work together at American Magic’s base in Newport, Rhode Island.

Q. How long have you been involved with American Magic and what do you do?

Dalbies: I was looking for a new challenge when I heard about the discussions with American Magic. A position related to simulation was open and I realised that I ticked all boxes, it seemed like a great opportunity. I’ve always been interested in racing teams such as Formula 1 and it sounded like that…but on water! I’m involved across several work packages, mainly supporting system simulation for the designers.

Ronceray: I started about a year ago, splitting my time evenly between Airbus work and the American Magic boat. Now I’m more like full-time on the simulator, optimising the boat controls so I’ll be spending a lot of my time in the U.S., fully integrated into the team. Our know-how was first requested for the smaller test boat known as the “Mule.” Now we’re working with it on the full-sized boat too – it’s huge and out of the water the hull looks like a whale!

Q. Is there a typical day?

Dalbies: In Santander, where I spend most my time, the usual office pattern although days are maybe longer, in the USA everything works around the boat. Whether it is on or off the water dictates what we do, after sailing there is a capture meeting with the crew to find improvements and that sets up what we do next.

Ronceray: An early breakfast with the shore team is followed by four or five hours of sailing. Sometimes we are out on the chase boat but often working on shore. Once the boat is back in the shed, we debrief.

We intend to win the America’s Cup.

- Laurent Dalbies

Q. Differences and similarities with Airbus?

Ronceray: The cycle is very similar to when I worked on the A350 XWB flight test campaign, but you go through it in a day rather than a month. The pace and size of the team are different, and you need to be your own project manager.

Dalbies: It is much the same pattern for me. My work follows the same principles and cycles although we iterate faster. The biggest difference is that I’m part of a much smaller team, there are 150 people in the American Magic team but in my area there are 50, 20 in Spain. That means you tend to work more broadly and quite independently compared to Airbus.

Q. How well did you adapt?

Dalbies: Quite smoothly. I wanted a new challenge, but the technical domain remained familiar. I’m also part of a very diverse team so everyone is used to bridging cultural differences. Being united behind a clear goal helps – we intend to win the America’s Cup.

Ronceray: Below water, the boat is like an aircraft – but major factors such as tides and, crucially, relying on the weather for power levels are completely different. Nevertheless, we apply aircraft tools to gain advantages for the team. I’ve become accustomed to the differences, and spending more time close to operations will help me to adapt further.

We apply aircraft tools to gain advantages for the team.

Qantas to select Airbus A350-1000 for Project Sunrise flights - The Points Guy,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3FhbnRhcy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtZm9yLXByb2plY3Qtc3VucmlzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas has selected an aircraft for Project Sunrise, its plan to start nonstop flights from Sydney to New York and London that would be the longest in the world — and it's a win for Airbus over Boeing.

The Australian airline announced that it is working with Airbus to prepare a contract for up to 12 A350-1000s. However, it is not certain that Qantas will actually begin the flights. In a press release, the airline said it will make a final decision in March 2020 on whether to operate the routes.

""After detailed evaluation of the Boeing 777X and Airbus A350, Qantas has selected the A350-1000 as the preferred aircraft if Sunrise proceeds,"" the statement read in part. ""This aircraft uses the Rolls Royce Trent XWB engine, which has a strong reliability record after being in service with airlines for more than two years. Airbus will add an additional fuel tank and slightly increase the maximum takeoff weight to deliver the performance required for Sunrise routes.""

TPG had an opportunity to take part in a Project Sunrise test flight in October, which was operated by a Boeing 787-9. That plane was not under serious consideration for the commercial flights however, since it could not fly the routes nonstop with a full load. No aircraft currently in production can, in fact.

Boeing's contender was the still-in-development 777X, a version of the 777, which has not flown yet. The A350 has a record of several years in airline service, but will need to be modified to serve these proposed new Qantas missions.

Before Project Sunrise flights can take off with paying customers, likely in 2023, Qantas still has a few hurdles to clear. The airline must receive regulatory approval for the new routes, and its pilots need to agree to a new contract that allows for flights that may surpass 20 hours."

United Airlines Holdings Inc. ordered its first long-range Airbus SE A321neo jets, dealing a new setback to Boeing Co. as the U.S. planemaker struggles through the grounding of its 737 Max.

The carrier said it would take 50 of Airbus’s A321XLR jets, with deliveries to begin in 2024—a year after the model’s planned debut. Valued at $7.1 billion before customary discounts, the order expands the U.S. foothold of a single-aisle variant capable of handling North Atlantic routes.

United plans to start replacing its Boeing 757-200 jets with the XLR, the jet closest to the U.S. manufacturer’s aging model, which went out of production about 15 years ago. Boeing has postponed deciding whether to develop the “new midmarket airplane” or NMA, a new plane of comparable size while it attempts to end the grounding of its workhorse Max, which was banned from the skies in March after two deadly crashes.

“The new Airbus A321XLR aircraft is an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network,” Andrew Nocella, United’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement Tuesday.

United also said it would defer its order of twin-aisle Airbus A350 jets to 2027 “to better align with the carrier’s operational needs.”

Airbus shares rose as much as 1.3%, and were changing hands at 125.32 euros, up 1% at 9:56 a.m. in Paris. The stock has gained 49% this year.

The airline’s XLR deal is particularly noteworthy since Chicago-based United is one of the largest customers of Boeing’s 737 Max 10 planes, with 100 on order. While that Max variant is designed to haul passenger loads similar to those of the A321, it will lack the range to tackle nine-hour flights like the XLR.

American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. have already ordered Airbus’s XLR. The European aerospace giant launched the model, its longest-range single-aisle aircraft, in June at the Paris Air Show. The plane can fly as far as 4,700 nautical miles, or 15% more than the A321LR model.

United said it would employ the XLR on certain existing trans-Atlantic routes, and explore using it to serve additional European destinations from its hubs in Washington and Newark, New Jersey.

The carrier operates 75 of Boeing’s 757 jets, including the larger 757-300 model. The airline said in October that it was actively considering how to replace that part of its fleet. United has 180 of the smaller Airbus A319 and A320 models and has been scouring the used market for more A319s."

Twenty years of X-ray astronomy with XMM-Newton - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMi10d2VudHkteWVhcnMtb2YteC1yYXktYXN0cm9ub215LXdpdGgteG1tLW5ld3RvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ESA satellite built by Airbus delivers sensational research results on exploding stars, black holes and galaxy clusters

Friedrichshafen, 09 December 2019 - One of the most successful European space missions is celebrating its birthday: the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory developed and built by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA) lifted off at 3.32 pm CET on 10 December 1999 to explore the wonders of the X-ray universe. Since its launch, XMM-Newton has simultaneously collected X-rays, visible and ultraviolet light and demonstrated its role as one of the most important astronomical observatories of all time. It has detected more X-ray sources than any previous satellite and is helping solve many cosmic mysteries, from what happens in and around black holes to the formation of galaxies in the early universe.

XMM-Newton has doubled its original deployment period of ten years. Due to the overwhelming scientific success and the telescope’s excellent condition, ESA has extended its mission year on year. Technically, it is quite possible that it will continue to operate beyond 2030.

Interest in conducting observations with the European space telescope remains high. Each year, for example, the requested observation time is up to seven times more than is actually available. The level of this excess demand is on a par with that for the Hubble Space Telescope.

The results of XMM observations also form part of many doctoral theses. These academic works are based both on scientific results (making use of XMM-Newton observations and numerical predictions) and on ‘technical’ work (hardware and software development, calibration or operations). Since the mission’s launch in 1999, almost 400 doctoral theses containing results or findings from the XMM satellite have been produced. In total, over 6,200 scientific ‘XMM papers’ have been published.

However, XMM-Newton is not just an outstanding achievement in scientific terms: bearing in mind that it took just 38 months to complete, management of the satellite project and its technological prowess must also be considered exemplary. The XMM-Newton satellite was built under the leadership of Airbus in Friedrichshafen, with the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) developed by Airbus UK, and Airbus in Spain contributing the structures of the service module and the focal plane assembly, and the satellite thermal control system and harness. In total, the industrial consortium comprised 45 European companies and one US company.

XMM-Newton, affectionately named the ‘Black Beauty’ by the engineers who built it on account of its black thermal protective film, consists of three cylindrical mirror systems mounted parallel to each other, enabling X-ray radiation to be concentrated in three focal planes. As a result, celestial bodies can be observed simultaneously with three cameras and two spectrometers. These spectrometers break down the X-ray radiation just as glass prisms split up sunlight into its rainbow colours. From the X-ray ‘colours’ the astronomers can ascertain important physical variables such as temperature, density, relative motion or the chemical composition of matter.

Just like light, X-ray radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, but hundreds if not several thousand times more powerful. It is emitted by bodies or gases with temperatures somewhere between a million and 100 million degrees Celsius. In effect, astronomers are using XMM-Newton to observe the hot part of the universe.

XMM-Newton, in its 48-hour orbit, travels nearly one third of the distance to the Moon. At the apogee (furthest point) of 114,000 kilometres away from the Earth, the satellite travels very slowly. At the perigee (closest point), it passes 7,000 kilometres above the Earth much faster at 24,120 kilometres per hour. XMM-Newton’s highly eccentric orbit has been chosen so that its instruments can work outside the radiation belts surrounding the Earth. Since Earth’s atmosphere blocks out all X-rays, only a telescope in space can detect and study celestial X-ray sources.

XMM-Newton ‘targets’ distant X-ray sources for long periods (often for more than 10 hours). One of the key requirements of the satellite was therefore its very high pointing accuracy and stability. XMM-Newton can control its orientation extremely precisely using two sets of four small thrusters and four momentum wheels mounted on the satellite.

The pointing accuracy of the 10-metre long XMM-Newton is 0.25 arcsec over a 10-second interval. This is the equivalent of seeing a melon from a distance of 300 kilometres, using a hand-held telescope and seeing it without the slightest wobble.

Airbus beats Boeing to become preferred supplier for Qantas Sydney-London flights - CNBC,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTIvMTMvYWlyYnVzLWJlY29tZXMtcHJlZmVycmVkLXN1cHBsaWVyLWZvci1xYW50YXMtc3lkbmV5LWxvbmRvbi1mbGlnaHRzLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOS8xMi8xMy9haXJidXMtYmVjb21lcy1wcmVmZXJyZWQtc3VwcGxpZXItZm9yLXFhbnRhcy1zeWRuZXktbG9uZG9uLWZsaWdodHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Qantas Airways logo is displayed on the tails of aircraft at the domestic terminal of Sydney Airport in Sydney, Australia, on February 19, 2013.

Qantas Airways said on Friday it has chosen Airbus as preferred supplier for jets capable of the world's longest-ever commercial flights from Sydney to London, beating rival Boeing after a hard-fought contest.

The Australian carrier said it would make a final decision in March on whether to proceed with an order for up to 12 A350-1000 jets fitted with an extra fuel tank to handle flights of up to 21 hours.

The flights would begin in the first half of 2023, but remain subject to reaching a pay deal with pilots, who would need to extend their duty times to around 23 hours to account for potential delays.

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline ""had a lot of confidence"" in the market or non-stop services from Sydney to London and to New York based on two years of flying non-stop from Perth to London, where it has achieved a fare premium over rivals.

""The A350 is a fantastic aircraft and the deal on the table with Airbus gives us the best possible combination of commercial terms, fuel efficiency, operating cost and customer experience,"" he said.

Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer thanked Qantas for its selection in a statement, while a Boeing spokesman said it was disappointed with the decision but looked forward to continuing its longstanding partnership with the airline.

Airbus no longer provides list prices for aircraft, but based on its 2018 price list, the Qantas order could be worth up to $4.4 billion before heavy discounts that are standard for airline customers.

The selection of the A350-1000 will add to growing doubts over Boeing's plans to produce the 777-8 that it had proposed to Qantas for the mission.

Boeing had already said the entry into service for the plane, a smaller, longer-range version of the 777-9, would be delayed beyond 2022 but has declined to give a new date, saying it would be based on customer demand.

Customers Emirates and Qatar Airways have indicated they could switch orders for the 777-8 to the 777-9.

The 777-9 is due to enter service in 2021, following delays associated with its GE engines.

The Boeing spokesman said on Friday the manufacturer was focused on the development of the 777-9 and after that it would complete development of the 777-8, with the first delivery scheduled a few years after that."

Marignane – Airbus Helicopters and OCCAR (Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement / Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation) have signed a tri-lateral Global Support Contract aimed at boosting the availability rate of the Tigers in service in the French, German, and Spanish Armies. With this long-term support agreement, Tiger readiness and supportability will be secured for the next decade and beyond. The contract covers critical items such as continuous improvement and obsolescence treatment as well as securing repair and spares capabilities with all vendors involved. In addition, it provides for the individual needs of each customer in line with their operational and deployment scenarios. For instance, in France, the agreement guarantees parts availability up to 98% and provides for the simplification of logistics as Airbus Helicopters will also directly take over the provisioning of new parts, as well as repaired parts and other expendables.

“We are proud to be providing long term and additional support to Tigers, especially when some of those Tigers are continuously deployed in important operational theatres. This contract allows our customers to reliably plan their support activities for the next decade” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.

At present 183 Tigers have been delivered to France, Germany, Spain, and Australia, and have accumulated over 130,000 flight hours to date. First deployed by the French Army in Afghanistan in 2009, and then shortly followed by the German and Spanish Armies, the Tiger continues to demonstrate its essential role on theatres of operation as a highly versatile, stealthy, and maneuverable attack helicopter."

United Ordering 50 Airbus A321XLRs - View from the Wing,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS91bml0ZWQtb3JkZXJpbmctNTAtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Roughly speaking Airbus makes the desirable narrowbody aircraft and Boeing makes the desirable widebodies. That was true before the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded, a huge blow to Boeing’s narrowbody competitiveness. However for most carriers the economics of the 787 and 777 outclass comparable Airbus jets.

The United Airlines fleet is Boeing for widebodies, and is currently split between Boeing and Airbus for narrowbodies – although legacy Continental Airlines executives, who had been in charge up until the ouster of CEO Jeff Smisek amidst a corruption probe, favored Boeing.

Airbus now is poised for a big win, as Bloomberg reports, because United is poised to order 50 Airbus A321XLR long range narrowbodies. Since the order is being reported at $7.1 billion we can assume it’s roughly half that. Deliveries would be slated to begin in 2024.

American Airlines ordered 50 A321XLRs to begin delivery in 2023 back in June.

This aircraft gives carriers the ability to fly between the U.S. East Coast and Midwest and Europe on an economical narrowbody aircraft, making it possible to serve routes that the 757 has operated but with a 25% lower unit cost.

With the deal, expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday, Airbus lines up another major U.S. customer for a model intended to replace Boeing’s out-of-production 757. The Chicago-based manufacturer has postponed deciding whether to develop a new jet of comparable size while it attempts to end the grounding of its workhorse Max, which was banned from the skies in March after two deadly crashes.

The A321XLR carries about the same number of passengers as a Boeing 737 MAX 10, but with longer ranges. These are expected to replace United 757s though not effectively 767s."

A total of seven helicopters of this type were ordered to renew their ageing Bell UH-1D search and rescue fleet.

“We are delighted to be able to deliver this helicopter not only on time, but in this case even before the contractually agreed deadline,” said Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland. “The H145 helicopters already operated by the Bundeswehr have proven themselves, in particular, through their very high levels of operational availability. We see a lot more possibilities for the flexible and reliable aircraft to perform a wide range of tasks in all branches of the armed forces.”

The Bundeswehr is also responsible for search and rescue operations (SAR) in the event of aircraft accidents on German territory. It therefore maintains a fleet of search and rescue helicopters on permanent standby, and these helicopters are also available for use in national disaster management operations. The Bell UH-1D model currently in use by the Bundeswehr first entered into service in the early 1970s. The new aircraft will be stationed at the sites in Niederstetten, Holzdorf and Nörvenich. The last of the H145 LUH SAR (Light Utility Helicopter Search and Rescue) helicopters will be delivered early 2021, once training has been completed. Airbus Helicopters will also be responsible for logistics support, repair, and maintenance of the helicopters.

Among other features, the helicopters are equipped with high-performance cameras, searchlights, emergency beacon locator systems, a full suite of medical equipment, rescue winches and load hooks that can be used for fire-extinguishing tanks, for example. They are easy to identify thanks to the characteristic bright orange paintwork on their doors, featuring ‘SAR’ in blue lettering."
