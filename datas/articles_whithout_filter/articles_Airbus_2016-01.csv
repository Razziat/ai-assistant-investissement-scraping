Uber to partner with Airbus for on-demand copter rides - CNBC,"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDEvMTcvdWJlci10by1wYXJ0bmVyLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWZvci1vbi1kZW1hbmQtY29wdGVyLXJpZGVzLXdzai5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTYvMDEvMTcvdWJlci10by1wYXJ0bmVyLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWZvci1vbi1kZW1hbmQtY29wdGVyLXJpZGVzLXdzai5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Uber has found an unlikely partner for its on-demand services in Airbus , the company announced on Sunday, with the aerospace giant providing helicopters for a pilot project.

As part of a new Silicon Valley-based initiative, Airbus has established a partnership with Uber was part of an experiment that would allow Uber users to hail copters, as well as other forms of transportation.

The recently-formed Airbus Ventures will operate with $150 million commitment to ""identify and invest in the most visionary entrepreneurs in the global aerospace ecosystem,"" Airbus said in a release.

The new link with Uber will allow Airbus to provide on-demand transportation service using its H125 and H130 helicopters. According to Airbus, the partnership will help carve out ""a new business model for helicopter operators to access a broader customer base.""

Neither Uber nor Airbus disclosed how much a helicopter ride share might cost—but given the method of transportation its likely to be a pretty penny. Airbus' first order of business will be at the Sundance Film Festival, where an Uber spokesperson told CNBC that Airbus helicopters will help make it easier for attendees to navigate the event.

The move may also help Airbus shore up a business segment that has lagged in recent years. The company's helicopter sales slumped in 2015, CEO Tom Enders has said previously.



The partnership was first reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier on Sunday. Enders told the publication that the team-up was ""pretty exciting"" for Airbus."

Airbus exceeds targets in 2015 – delivers the most aircraft ever - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wMS1haXJidXMtZXhjZWVkcy10YXJnZXRzLWluLTIwMTUtZGVsaXZlcnMtdGhlLW1vc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtZXZlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Highest number of Airbus airliners ever delivered – 635

Net orders achieved totalling 1,080 aircraft – increasing backlog by 445 aircraft

Overall result: industry year-end record backlog of 6,831 aircraft

Airbus has exceeded its targets for 2015, achieving a new record of 635 aircraft deliveries for 85 customers of which 10 are new. These deliveries comprise: 491 A320 Family aircraft; 103 A330s; 27 A380s; and 14 A350 XWBs. This production achievement means that Airbus’ aircraft deliveries in 2015 were up for the 13th year in a row, surpassing the previous year-end delivery record of 629 aircraft – set in 2014.

Airbus also achieved 1,080 net orders from 55 customers (of which ten are new), comprising 945 single-aisle aircraft and 135 widebodies. At 2015 year-end the overall backlog had climbed to a new industry record of 6,831 aircraft valued at US$1000.9 billion at list prices.

Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO said: “This commercial and industrial performance unequivocally proves that global demand for our aircraft has remained resilient.” He adds: “In 2015 Airbus has also laid firm foundations for the future, increasing the capability and variety of the aircraft which we can offer to our customers.”

Overall, 2015 has been a year of solid and wide-ranging Airbus accomplishments. For example, the A320neo was certified by the aviation authorities on both sides of the Atlantic just five years after its launch. In addition, Airbus delivered 14 A350s – making good its pledge to the airlines who are now benefitting from the world’s most efficient and advanced airliner. Important progress was also made on the A350 programme’s next variant, the A350-1000 – whose major components and structures are now taking shape across various production sites. Likewise, parts are now in production for the first A330neo – with the machining of its first engine pylon and centre wing-box components. In addition, there has been good news for the flagship A380, 10 years after its first flight, with the programme breaking-even for the first time.

Another notable highlight was of course September’s official opening of the first Airbus factory in the US, at Mobile on Alabama’s Gulf Coast, where between 40 and 50 A320 Family aircraft will be produced annually by 2018. On the other side of the globe in China, additional orders for the A330 not only complements our plans for a new A330 completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, but also helps to smooth our transition towards the A330neo. Furthermore, in 2015 Airbus launched three new incremental aircraft developments which include: the Long-Range version of the A321neo which will offer true transatlantic operation; the Regional version of the A330 which is optimized to seat up to 400 passengers on missions up to 3,000nm; and the Ultra Long Range version of the A350-900, capable of 19-hour flights.

Headquartered in Toulouse, France, Airbus is the leading commercial aircraft manufacturer with the most modern, comprehensive and efficient family of airliners, ranging in capacity from 100 to more than 500 seats. Employing some 55,000 people, Airbus champions innovative technologies and has sold over 16,300 aircraft to around 400 customers worldwide. Airbus has design and manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, the UK, and Spain, as well as subsidiaries in the US, China, Japan, India and in the Middle East. In addition, it provides the highest standard of customer support and training through an expanding international network."
"Iran's Sanctions Lift, and the West Goes to Talk Business (Published 2016) - The New York Times","Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDEvMjYvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9haXJidXMtaXJhbi1haXJjcmFmdC10YWxrcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus said Monday it was in talks with Iran toward the sale of dozens of new commercial aircraft — part of a number of international business deals likely to flow toward Iran since it agreed to curtail its nuclear ambitions.

It represents the first wave of a broad rethinking of the Iranian market by Western businesses after they were banned from doing business there for nearly two decades. The nuclear deal led to the lifting of crippling economic sanctions on Iran that have left Tehran with a long shopping list, from planes to cars to oil-field equipment.

Iran’s transportation minister, Abbas Akhoondi, announced the Airbus developments at an aviation event in Tehran, saying that the country had been in talks for nearly a year to buy planes ranging from 100-seat turboprops to the 555-seat twin-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo. However, “there was no way to pay for them because of banking sanctions,” Mr. Akhoondi said, according to state news media.

Companies have long been anticipating returning to Iran, with its 81 million, mostly young consumers who have already shown an avid taste for smuggled Western cigarettes and Apple electronics. Bootleg versions of Western restaurants abound in Iranian cities, from “Pizza Hat” to “Mash Donald’s.”"

Airbus now has $1 trillion worth of jets on order - Fortune,"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wMS8xMi9haXJidXMtMS10cmlsbGlvbi1qZXRzLW9yZGVyZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Tuesday, European aerospace giant Airbus (EADSY) announced it had drummed up 1,036 plane orders last year, figure that has the company soundly beating rival Boeing (BA) in 2015. Pushing Airbus’s total order backlog to a record-setting 6,787 aircraft, the new orders mean the company has roughly $1 trillion dollars worth of new airplanes slated for delivery over the next decade.

But orders are one thing, finished commercial airliners another. Boeing retains the title of world’s biggest plane maker for at least another year, as Airbus still lags its chief rival on deliveries. In fact, Boeing bested its own record for aircraft delivered in 2015, handing over 762 commercial airplanes to customers, 39 more than the previous year. Meanwhile, Airbus managed just 635 deliveries in 2015.

As airlines across the globe continue to retooling their fleets with newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, both Airbus and Boeing continue to ramp up production. But rising interest rates and continued low oil prices could blunt the unprecedented demand that’s driven the duopoly’s combined backlog to more than 12,000 total jets, analysts say.

SIGN UP: Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology.

The impact of low oil prices is already be manifesting itself, says Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at aerospace consultancy Teal Group. Compared with the previous year, both companies saw orders slow in 2015—even as Airbus’s total backlog reached new highs for the industry. “With oil at $33 a barrel, retirements [of old aircraft] are doing exactly what they should be doing, which is declining fast,” Aboulafia says. “That means maintaining the upward angle of production as planned would be ill-advised.” But that hasn’t stopped either Boeing or Airbus from forging ahead with plans to deliver even more aircraft in 2016. For its part, Airbus plans to deliver 650 total aircraft in 2015–15 more than last year–even as some of its new production lines continue to suffer growing pains. The company plans to produce 50 wide-body A350 jets this year, an astounding figure when you consider it only delivered 14 of them in 2015 (one shy of its production goal). The first delivery of Airbus’s new, more fuel-efficient A320neo is also running behind schedule, due to supply chain issues. Boeing also plans to dial up its production numbers in 2016, though it has yet to release production targets for the new year. Overall, with nearly 1,400 combined jetliner deliveries between the two companies last year, the industry is producing roughly double the planes it did a decade ago. Demand for new jets has been driven jointly by high oil prices, and an increased consumer demand for air travel in growing markets like China, India, and the Middle East. And the backlog of 12,000 airliners might seem like a guarantee of demand for the foreseeable future, but if rising interests rates tighten airlines’ supply of cheap cash, or prolonged low fuel prices curb the need for more efficient aircraft, it could prove more difficult for Boeing and Airbus to deliver their orders as quickly as they’d like, says Aboulafia. WATCH: For more on the aerospace industry, watch this Fortune video. Moreover, given that significant chunks of those backlogs are for new aircraft that are still under development, like Boeing’s 737MAX, the conditions that pushed airlines to place orders in the first place could change drastically by the time the jets are ready for delivery. The airplane makers themselves seem optimistic that variables like fuel prices are already factored into customer demand. This is because airlines will likely continue upgrading their fleets to more fuel-efficient aircraft, even if fuel prices remains low, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier told reporters Tuesday. Airlines “do not expect oil prices to stay low forever,” said Brégier."

Dissection of the 2015 Airbus order book - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMS8xMy9kaXNzZWN0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS0yMDE1LWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1ib29rL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jan. 13, 2016, © Leeham Co. Airbus yesterday reported 1,139 gross and 1,036 net orders for 2015, dramatically out-performing Boeing’s sales figures.

Boeing’s 737NG outsold the A320ceo family but the A320neo captured 67% of the sales vs the 737 MAX. The A321neo picked up 98.3% of the market against the 737-9.

Boeing dominates the twin-engine wide-body sector, posting 212 gross orders compared with 170 for Airbus. Airbus recorded a 45% market share.

But Boeing’s clear win was due to the freighter sector, with the tipping order the 49 767-300ERFs from FedEx. Boeing sold 71 freighters last year, compared with just four by Airbus.

Lining up passenger-to-passenger model sales only, Airbus sold 166 twin-engine wide-body airplanes and Boeing sold 141, for a 46% market share.

A320 Family

Airbus sold 564 A320neo, or 58% of its family sales, followed by 294 A321neos, or 31% (Figure 1). Airbus predicts that over time, the A321 will account for about half the sales.

The A319 series was a non-factor. No ceos and only three neos were sold. One A318 was ordered, an Airbus Corporate Jet model. The A319neo is moving to take over the role of the ACJ and the A318, which isn’t getting the neo treatment, will be terminated along with the rest of the ceo line in about two years.

A330 Family

Airbus concentrated last year on selling enough A330ceos to fill the production bridge, at 6/mo, to the A330neo. Officials said this goal was achieved and now the sales force will focus on selling the neo.

No A330-800s were sold. Fifty A330-900 orders were booked, but 83 A330-300s and 17 A330-200s were sold. Four A330Fs were also ordered.

Clearly the big Airbus weakness in wide-bodies is its freighter presence. Despite a continuing weak cargo market, Boeing’s outstanding performance in this sector—95% of the orders—remains a Boeing strength.

A350 Family and A380

A350 sales have stalled. There were 16 gross orders but 19 cancellations (in favor of the A330-900), resulting in a net loss of three orders for the year.

Officials say that one reason sales slowed was that the backlog extends to 2020 and beyond. However, Boeing’s 787 backlog likewise extends well out, but Boeing posted nearly 100 new orders (including some being the white-trail Terrible Teens).

Market Intelligence suggests that Airbus was more focused on trying to sell the A380. Little success has been achieved here. There were three orders from an Unidentified customer, but widely reported to three white tails resulting from the SkyMark Airlines bankruptcy. Japan’s ANA participated in the SkyMark reorganization with Airbus backing and it was also reported that a presumed quid-pro-quo was an A380 order.

Whether this is the case or not, Airbus now records 319 program orders. There were 317 orders at the end of 2014. One A380 cancellation was recorded in 2015.

Airbus Chairman: Alabama A320 factory shows commitment to U.S. | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Mon, 04 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTYvMDEvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtZmFjdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SELECTING U.S. HOME

McArtor, who was in Alabama last September to celebrate the official opening of Airbus’ first U.S. production center, also discussed why the European industrial consortium selected the site in Mobile for this critical mission.

“The new Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility at the Mobile Aeroplex in Brookley, Alabama is an aerospace industrial hub whose reach extends along the Gulf shores into Texas and across the Deep South,” he writes. “It sits amid world-class ports, roads and rails. It stands near Alabama’s many great achievements for space flight.”

McArtor added that the U.S. is the largest market for the single-aisle A320 Family aircraft that will be produced in Mobile, where Airbus already operates an engineering center. Another key reason the company selected Alabama: the skilled workforce in the region.

“Over the last decade, we came to fully appreciate the abundance of experienced aerospace workers in Alabama and the surrounding Gulf state region,” he writes. “Of the more than 300 manufacturing employees in Mobile today, over 60 percent are from the Mobile area, and an additional 25 percent from other parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. And we are pleased that more 30 percent are veterans.”

‘MASSIVE INVESTMENT’

Airbus invested $600 million to build the Alabama manufacturing facility, which will deliver its first completed aircraft this year. By the end of 2017, the Mobile facility will roll out as many as 50 advanced airliners each year. (See a video showing A320 production will flow at the facility.)

McArtor said the company’s Alabama factory reflects the resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has created 800,000 jobs since 2010. The Mobile assembly facility will employ 1,000 people at full production.

“This center of excellence is one more sign that manufacturing jobs have come back in force, and advanced industries are leading the U.S. recovery.

Airbus is proud to be a part of that story with a massive investment in the people and productivity of the United States.”

According to Airbus, the agreement was signed at the Élysée Palace in Paris during Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit with French PresidentFrançois Hollande.

The deal signed by Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh includes 73 widebody and 45 single aisle airliners.

""Today’s announcement is the start of re-establishing our civil aviation sector into the envy of the region and along with partners like Airbus we’ll ensure the highest world standards,"" Iran Air Chairman and CEO Mr Farhad Parvaresh said in a statement.

Although the deal is valued at more than $25 billion based on catalog prices, it likely the Iranian government negotiated significant discounts for such a large bulk order.

""Today is a significant step in the overhaul and modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector and Airbus stands ready to play its role in supporting it.""

Due to economic sanctions levied against Iran over the past few decades, the country's national airline has been unable to expand its service and update its fleet. As a result, Iran Air's current fleet has an average age of 26.8 years according to Airfleets.net.



International sanctions were lifted this month, after Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program.

The airline's fleet of half a dozen Boeing 747-200 and SP model jets are more than 36 years old and will presumably be replaced by the new A330, A350 and A380 widebodies. Iran Air currently operates more than 20 Airbus A300, A310 and A320 aircraft.

Iran Air's order of 12 A380 super jumbos is the first confirmed airline order for the aircraft since Emirates bought a batch more than two years ago. Although it was reported earlier this month that Japan's ANA agreed to purchase three of the jets for service between Tokyo and Hawaii, neither the airline nor Airbus have been able to confirm the order."
All Nippon Airways and the A380: Airbus wins a new customer in return for invaluable Skymark support | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Sat, 09 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2FsbC1uaXBwb24tYWlyd2F5cy1hbmQtdGhlLWEzODAtYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtYS1uZXctY3VzdG9tZXItaW4tcmV0dXJuLWZvci1pbnZhbHVhYmxlLXNreW1hcmstc3VwcG9ydC0yNjA1MzHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus switched Skymark restructuring support from Delta to ANA, despite ANA not being a major Airbus customer

Skymark, which was Japan's third largest carrier, entered bankruptcy following mismanagement of its A330 expansion and the looming debt of pending A380 deliveries, a contract that Airbus cancelled when it determined (at a critical point in the production process) that Skymark would be unable to pay for them. Skymark was placed under rehabilitation led by Japanese investment firm Integral. A number of airlines put forward proposals to take a stake in Skymark and to be a partner in the rehabilitation.

Bidders for the failed airline included ANA, Delta, Hainan and Jetstar, among others.

The attraction was not just Skymark's licence, but also its 36 daily slot pairs (third largest after ANA and JAL) at the restricted airport Tokyo Haneda, and the potential for a partnership that would greatly boost the other carrier's presence in Japan.

ANA initially rejected any involvement that would mean taking A330s or A380s, either formally or through a gentleman's agreement. Skymark returned its A330s to lessors Intrepid and CIT (who accounted for 38% and 14% of Skymark's debt respectively) while it never actually received its A380s, some of which were in the production process, and still sit forlornly in Toulouse. Airbus accounted for 29% of Skymark's debt and Rolls-Royce (the powerplant supplier for the A380s) - 16%.

ANA's unwillingness to take aircraft as part of its involvement in Skymark appears to have prompted Airbus to state: ""If Skymark submits the plan (that involves ANA's sponsorship), there is a significant and realistic risk that it would not be able to gain the support of major creditors, including Airbus"".

Skymark creditors: Jul-2015

In the final vote, however, it was ANA that the creditors backed. The Japanese government certainly preferred a local partner over a foreign one (even if it was US airline Delta, from a stable trading partner), but it was the creditors who voted.

There was little risk for Airbus in offending ANA. There are only 11 Airbus aircraft in ANA's fleet (a 5% share), all low margin narrowbodies. There are a further 37 Airbus aircraft, also all narrowbodies, on order. ANA has stakes in other Japanese airlines that operate Airbus narrowbodies, including StarFlyer, Peach and Vanilla Air, but unofficially Airbus never saw these airlines as the major Airbus operator it wanted to secure in Boeing-heavy Japan.

Unusually for previously Boeing-dominated US airlines, Delta operates 162 Airbus aircraft, including 36 widebodies. Delta also has 56 Airbus widebodies on order, as well as narrowbodies on order. There are presumably further sales opportunities at Delta, unlike at ANA, where the future long haul fleet has been cemented around the 787 and 777X.

Without an understanding that ANA would help Airbus there would appear to have been little reason for Airbus to support ANA's plan at the expense of upsetting Delta. (This excludes the other candidates [Hainan and Jetstar] whose proposals did not even made it as far as Delta's, yet they are also bigger Airbus customers than ANA.)

See related reports:

A380s under other circumstances would not fit in ANA's fleet

ANA has many times in the past studied the A380 and passed on ordering it. ANA established its long term long haul fleet needs with an order for 20 777-9Xs to supplement 787s. ANA has 35 787-8s and nine -9s in service, with one more -8 on order, 35 -9s on order, and three -10s on order. Between Mar-2014 and Jan-2015, ANA placed orders for 85 aircraft, including narrowbodies.

ANA aircraft orders: Mar-2014 to Jan-2015

Included in ANA's orders is planned replacement - such as 787s replacing 767s, 777Xs replacing current 777s - but also growth to bring the group fleet from 255 in Mar-2016 to 305 in Mar-2021, including LCCs. At ANA mainline growth was last projected to occur from 235 to 265.

The defining widebody type of aircraft is the 787, a strategy designed to let ANA take advantage of its geography and serve secondary long haul markets non-stop, while also having high frequency on trunk routes. Further, ANA suffers from a cost base disadvantage; it is Asia's highest cost airline, which ultimately limits where it can grow.

ANA Group projected fleet composition: Mar-2016 to Mar-2021

In the core trans-Pacific market that ANA competes in, frequency, not capacity per se, has been a key competitive factor - led by Cathay Pacific, which has four daily flights to Los Angeles, and five daily flights to New York City (three non-stop to JFK, one to JFK via Vancouver, and one to Newark).

Air China, an emerging long haul heavyweight, has upwards of three daily flights to Los Angeles. Tellingly, China Southern in 2015 evaluated deploying its A380 to New York or introducing a second daily frequency.

It chose second daily, despite having slack in its underutilised A380 fleet.

ANA benefits from a fiercely loyal local market that prefers to travel on Japanese airlines, giving high point-to-point yields that ANA can supplement with discounted connecting traffic. Outbound Japanese travel, however, is declining and passengers of other nationalities do not have the same attachment to flying on a certain airline as ANA's core Japanese passengers are.

ANA has difficulty accessing markets, including China and India markets, which are staple connecting traffic sources for North America, since its cost base is so high. This ultimately limits potential. 777Xs and 787s allow ANA to deploy frequency, with the newest, cost-effective aircraft, while limiting capacity.

The A380 brings limited opportunities to help ANA overcome slot challenges. ANA has long haul hubs at Tokyo Narita and Tokyo Haneda. Narita is no longer slot limited the way it was a decade ago; more slots have been created while carriers have shifted capacity from Narita to Haneda. At Haneda, international slots are allocated by the government to a specific country. ANA cannot redeploy its slots freely, at will.

The A380 is not ideal for ANA to improve connectivity

Haneda is the preferred airport for point-to-point business travellers, as well as those making domestic connections, since Narita has very limited domestic flights. Most of ANA's European services, and many of its Asian services, operate from Haneda, and these tend to include only limited sixth freedom traffic.

In comparison, ANA's USA network is mostly from Narita and carries far more sixth freedom connections than European services. Tokyo is a convenient hub between North America and other points in Asia, but from Europe Tokyo has not cultivated connecting hub status, since there are numerous direct options to other Asian countries.

Consolidating flights (possibly at the expense of frequency) does not necessarily allow ANA to add a flight to a new market. ANA has two daily Singapore flights from Haneda but at opposite times of the day, to facilitate business travel and two-way connectivity. There is some overlap with its double daily Singapore-Tokyo Narita flights, but Narita services are needed for two-way long haul connections. It is unlikely that ANA will be able to consolidate its long haul network to Tokyo Haneda any time soon, therefore it needs connecting flights at both airports.

Regional A380 use is hardly productive; other carriers do it to utilise ground time or, as in the case of Thai, they have found the originally intended deployment into long haul flying to be too challenging.

The share of ANA's Tokyo-area international flights departing from Haneda has increased from 8% in 1Q2006 to 43% in 1Q2016. This has occurred due to growth at Haneda. ANA's international Narita operation is as large as ever, even though Haneda is catching up in size.

Average daily ANA international flights from Tokyo Haneda and Tokyo Narita: 1Q2006-1Q2016

Another argument for the A380 is to upgauge without adding frequency. Many airlines have done this; Korean Air, for example, has preserved some trunk route frequency but increased capacity by upgauging. The A380's touted low cost base is relevant only if the aircraft can be filled. ANA would likely struggle to fill an A380 on trunk routes profitably.

Besides, ANA being the launch operator of the 787 and one of the first for the 777X means it will have newer and more efficient aircraft than carriers who evaluated the A380 against other types of aircraft, such as the 747-400 (which Korean Air replaced with A380s).

The introduction of the A380 brings the cost and complexity of an all-new widebody aircraft type. ANA's long haul fleet is built around the 777/787, which have some commonality. The A380 would be entirely separate, and would require ANA to establish its first (in its current era) Airbus widebody support.

Other airlines have more complex fleets, but simplicity has been an objective of ANA. ANA said of its simplified long haul fleet structure: ""we will be able to streamline personnel training and assignment, such as for cockpit crew and mechanics, and generate cost savings by reducing inventories of aircraft maintenance parts and other items"". The introduction of the A380 goes against those stated objectives.

ANA must find a way to make the A380s work - or minimise the impact

Like other airlines, ANA has probably identified a handful of routes that could justify an A380, based on variable costs, but performance is not strong enough, and the routes are not numerous enough, to cover the full costs of the flights, including acquisition and maintenance. Still, ANA's A380 situation is unlike any that of other carrier: having very large aircraft is not the objective. The A380s are the trade-off for ANA securing Skymark.

Thus ANA's evaluation is not whether the A380 is justified on its own, but whether the A380 can be offset by profits from Skymark. The calculation is probably impossible to quantify, where the alternative scenario is for Skymark to fall into the hands of Delta.

Delta has demonstrated its equity investments are not mere tokens; the airline turns its acquisitions into more sustainable operations, integrated into the Delta framework. Delta would likely have made Skymark far more efficient than ANA will ever be able to, as well as generating significant synergies. The threat of a third competitor in the domestic and long haul market was so great as to make any other option preferable. The complexity of an A380 operation, and possibly even of sustaining losses, becomes an acceptable trade-off.

See related reports:

Now ANA must work out where to deploy A380s, not because it wants to, but because it has to.

ANA, for its upcoming mid-term management plan debut, is expected to give more insight into its plans for the A380 operation. For now, press leaks have suggested Hawaii as a market for the A380s.

This immediately brings the A380 discussion to a different point: the leisure nature of the Hawaii market means that A380s cannot be optimally operated on both Hawaii and trunk routes.

Three A380s on Hawaii would be overkill, so other markets must come into focus, but it seems these will need to be outside the Pacific Ocean ""beach"" resort markets, since Hawaii is the only sizeable market in the region. CAPA has previously examined ANA's wish to gain a stronger footing in Hawaii and elsewhere, a market where JAL is still larger, despite ANA overall being larger than JAL.

ANA and JAL group seat capacity to Guam, Palau and Hawaii: 2015

See related report: Vanilla Air could give All Nippon Airways a larger group presence in Hawaii and Pacific Islands

There is a smaller impact for Vanilla Air, which had been considering Hawaii expansion

Establishing a larger ANA Group presence in Hawaii had been an option considered for ANA's wholly owned and newly established LCC, Vanilla Air. This would have been facilitated by giving widebodies to Vanilla Air. At one point there was consideration of Vanilla operating Skymark's former A330s. Vanilla had planned to double its fleet from eight A320s, at the end of 2015, to over 16 A320s by the end of 2018.

Vanilla may continue with this plan. A bolder move from the ANA Group would be to end the overlap between wholly owned Vanilla Air and partially owned Peach, consolidating the two into one LCC, but this may be too bold a step for ANA - and Peach's independent owners would extract a high rent.

Outlook: ANA must promote conservative strategy while Airbus still needs A380 promotion

The savings from combining two regional flights to an A380 and upgauging one or two long haul routes to an A380 does not justify the acquisition and programme cost of an all new widebody, let alone one whose size brings risk and does not have the same efficiency as other current and future aircraft in the fleet. Still - this was never the calculation ANA was making.

A question is now whether ANA will expand beyond the three A380s it is said to have committed to. Three is a sub-optimal fleet size, and additional aircraft would bring scale - but perhaps will not find enough suitable markets to be justified.

There are wider issues from this scenario. The first is with ANA. There is already some concern that it is growing too fast, and in too many areas. ANA is partially looking to expedite growth while JAL, under bankruptcy exit conditions, is limited in making new investments, such as in routes.

ANA, having spent years as Japan's secondary carrier, wants to cement its position as the largest in Japan - and one of the largest in Asia. ANA still has considerable fleet growth coming in but there are concerns that it has started to exhaust its market options. One of its newest routes, Kuala Lumpur, is considered by some to be a stretch. Yet there will need to be more routes after Kuala Lumpur.

The easy North American opportunities have been taken; others will be more challenging and will put ANA under market conditions it has not encountered before. Meanwhile, ANA's international airline investment strategy has yet to make a solid move. Its first attempt with an airline in Myanmar was linked to a US sanctions list.

Deploying A380s on trunk long haul routes would raise concerns, so the suggestion that the aircraft will be deployed to Hawaii, and other unnamed points, at least may calm the doubters. ANA will be eager to promote the A380s as being tactical vehicles for specific markets, relatively isolated from competition. The main trans-Pacific Asia-North America market is suffering from overcapacity; recent capacity growth is already enough of a concern before vaulting A380s into the scene.

Yet a restricted use, predominantly on leisure routes is not the message of the future that Airbus would ideally like ANA's A380 order to connote: the prestige, iconic fleet member that characterised it initially. It would perhaps prefer ANA's use of the aircraft to result in other Asian carriers placing top-up or new A380 orders.

There could be many looking to find links and inflate far-fetched order scenarios resulting from ANA and the A380. Most airlines, however, will likely see the situation for what it is. Although a big name carrier that has previously resisted very large aircraft will now probably take the A380, it is unlikely to offer a new model for ANA's peers to follow.

Then again, timing is everything; Emirates' new use of the aircraft as an ultra-high density leisure vehicle may be a way for the future."

Lufthansa becomes launch customer of best-selling A320neo

The Lufthansa Group, Airbus’ largest airline customer and operator, marks a major step in aviation history today by taking delivery of the first A320neo, the world’s best-selling and most fuel efficient single aisle aircraft.

Equipped with all new technology Pratt & Whitney PurePower® Geared Turbofan™ engines, the A320neo sets a new, even higher standard in aircraft efficiency, reducing emissions and noise as well as burning 15% less fuel than current generation aircraft from day one and 20% less by 2020.

“We are happy that today we are the first airline worldwide to receive the Airbus A320neo. Featuring the leading technology of Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the A320neo is by far the most efficient and most silent aircraft on short- and medium-haul routes.

With lower fuel consumption and consequently lower CO2 emissions, the A320neo has a clearly improved environmental performance. Furthermore, the new jet engine technology makes the aircraft considerably quieter. As a result, we have ordered a total of 116 aircraft of this type for the airlines of the Lufthansa Group”, states Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG.

“Today we prove once again that as an aviation company and airline group we are pioneers in the development and introduction of technical innovations. In this year alone the Lufthansa Group will receive a total of 52 new aircraft, a number we have not received in years”, says Spohr.

“Pratt & Whitney congratulates Lufthansa as the launch customer for the A320neo aircraft powered by PW1100G-JM engines,” said Robert Leduc, Pratt & Whitney President.. “Airbus and Lufthansa have been important customers for Pratt & Whitney for many years. With the A320neo’s unprecedented reductions in fuel burn, emissions and noise, I am confident that these business relationships will have continued success for many years to come.”

“Handing over the first A320neo to a world’s leading airline and long standing Airbus customer, Lufthansa, is a truly great day for everyone at Airbus,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “This occasion marks a new step forward to delivering on our promises and meeting our industry’s goal for sustainable aviation. The A320neo embodies Airbus’ passion and commitment to deliver maximum value and efficiency to our customers through continuous innovations.“

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklet wing tip devices. With almost 4,500 orders received from nearly 80 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.

Last year Lufthansa celebrated its 60th anniversary since it started operations in 1955. In this period, Lufthansa Group’s Airbus orders have reached a combined total of 582 aircraft including 386 A320 Family, of which 116 are NEOs (71 A320neo and 45 A321neo). The full range of Airbus wide-body aircraft have been or will be a part of Lufthansa’s fleet from the innovative A300/A310 to the iconic A380 (14 in service), the versatile A330 to the modern and extra-comfortable A350 XWB (25 firm orders)."

European aircraft maker Airbus delivered the first A320neo jetliner to German carrier Lufthansa on Wednesday.

The handover took place in a muted ceremony at the company’s Hamburg production plant in northern Germany. It was attended by what appeared — via photos — to be only a handful of top executives from Airbus, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, and Lufthansa. Lufthansa unexpectedly wound up as the launch customer in the waning days of 2015, after a last-minute switch with Qatar Airways. Documentation issues further delayed the first delivery into 2016.

“We are happy that today we are the first airline worldwide to receive the Airbus A320neo,” said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, in a statement.

Lufthansa expects to initiate the jet into passenger service as early as this Sunday, putting it on routes between its Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich hubs.

“Handing over the first A320neo to a world’s leading airline and long standing Airbus customer, Lufthansa, is a truly great day for everyone at Airbus,” said Airbus president and CEO Fabrice Brégier via a statement.

The A320neo — ""neo"" is short for ""new-engine-option"" — is an upgraded version of Airbus’ successful A320-family line of narrow-body, single-aisle jets. Sporting new engines, enhanced winglets and other improvements, Airbus says the jet could be 15% more efficient than current generation A320-family models.

Airbus currently offers three versions of the upgraded neo jets: the A319, -20 and -21. The airplanes seat between 140 and 240 passengers, depending on the model of jet and seat configuration chosen by the airline. The first delivered jet, a -20 version, will seat 180 in a two-class layout.

The jets have already been selling remarkably well, with Airbus claiming over 4,400 orders thus far. That places the A320neo comfortably ahead of its chief rival, Boeing’s 737 MAX; a similarly upgraded version of the popular 737 due to enter service in 2017.

The two programs underscore a shift in aircraft manufacturing by many of the top players away from brand-new jet programs, known as “clean-sheet” designs, and into the world of evolutionary advancements to already proven products. Boeing’s MAX program rehashes a jet that first flew in the 1960s, while Airbus’ first A320 made its maiden flight in 1988.

In like fashion, Airbus is upgrading its A330 wide-body program with the A330neo, while Boeing is set to revamp the 777 wide-body jet with a forthcoming 777X jetliner. Brazilian jet-maker Embraer, which builds regional aircraft, has begun work on the E2, a major upgrade of its popular E170 and E190 E-Jet family.

Wednesday’s first A320neo delivery also marks a major milestone for engine maker Pratt & Whitney, which poured billions into creating its new geared turbofan (GTF) engine. Touted as being both highly efficient and extremely quiet compared to existing power plants, P&W’s GTF makes its in-service debut with the Airbus’ neo. It is currently on offer for four other airplane programs, including Bombardier’s beleaguered mid-size CSeries aircraft and Mitsubishi’s MRJ commuter jet.

Airbus, the French plane-manufacturing rival to Boeing, reported Tuesday that it delivered a company record 635 aircraft last year to 85 customers.

Airbus said the total represented its 13th year of gains, surpassing 629 in 2014.

“This commercial and industry performance unequivocally proves that global demand for our aircraft has remained resilient,” said Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus based in Toulouse, France.

For comparison, Boeing announced Thursday that it delivered a company record 762 commercial planes last year, up 39 from the previous year.

Airbus also reported 1,036 net orders for the year, bringing the total backlog of orders to 6,787.

For comparison, Boeing reported 768 net orders for the year, for a backlog of 5,795.

The types of planes Airbus delivered included:

• 491 A320 family aircraft, which are comparable to Boeing’s 737.

• 103 wide-body A330 aircraft.

• 27 of the jumbo A380s.

• 14 fuel-efficient A350, which competes with Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner.

“In 2015, Airbus has also laid firm foundations for the future, increasing the capability and variety of the aircraft which we can offer to our customers,” Bregier said.

In September, Airbus opened a factory in Mobile, Ala. The company plans to build 40 to 50 A320 family aircraft at the facility by 2018.

Airbus also plans a completion and delivery center for A330 aircraft in Tianjin, China."
New Life Breathed into the Airbus A380 Program By... Iran Air?! - View from the Wing,"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS80NDI3NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 is a special plane for passengers, but has largely been a commercial failure. Airbus simply made the wrong bet on the future of air travel.

For passengers the larger plane has meant more amenities and more space — although it was supposed to mean more amenities for everyone, not just bars in business class and showers in first.



Singapore A380 Suites

Now Emirates has a version of the plane in service (flying to Bangkok, Copenhagen, Kuala Lumpur and Manchester) with 615 seats.

The question for an airline is whether a given route has as many passengers as an A380 can hold, where it’s economical to fly such a large aircraft. You need to fill an A380 for it to make sense. And that’s not something that works on most routes. The point of the 787 (and indeed the A350) is to bypass hubs and fly passengers between cities where they want to go directly, and earn a non-stop revenue premium doing so.

Conceptually it was supposed to fly hub-to-hub between heavily congested slot-controlled airports — London Heathrow to New York JFK, for instance. There are plenty of passengers, and airlines can reduce their number of flights, making it possible to serve more destinations.

However passengers still prefer – and pay for – greater frequencies on a route like that. And so there aren’t that many airlines making a business of flying that many passengers on a given flight. Which is why the Airbus A380 has been largely a failure and why Airbus has considered bringing the program to an end.

Still, as a passenger, I love the A380 or at least I love what some airlines have done with it like Emirates (showers!), Singapore (double beds in their middle section suites), and Qantas (the best way to fly between the US and Australia). Even as I don’t love all A380s (I’m talking to you, Air France).



Emirates A380 Shower

With only just over 300 planes ordered, they’re probably 100 orders away from breaking even on the project (although Airbus would say it’s no longer losing money). Airbus hadn’t had a single order that firmed between mid-2013 and the end of 2015. Only Emirates remains truly enthusiastic about the plane. The UAE-based carrier represents over 40% of Airbus’ order book for the superjumbo. Otherwise, the planes just aren’t selling.

Japan’s Skymark Airlines was scheduled to take the A380, but it went bankrupt. ANA won Airbus’ support as a creditor to take control of Skymark (really they just wanted Skymark’s slots at Tokyo Haneda) by agreeing to accept the Skymark A380s. ANA says they’ll operate the planes to Honolulu.

Now it looks like Airbus finally has a new customer for the aircraft: Iran Air.

Iran has struck a provisional deal with Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) to buy eight A-380 superjumbo planes to be delivered from 2019, the deputy transport minister told Reuters on Sunday. A deal for 127, mainly new, aircraft which it hopes to complete this week also includes 16 A350 jets, Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy transport minister said in an interview on the sidelines of an aviation conference in Tehran.

It’s not an order yet, let alone a firm order. And it could just be a head fake, I’d bet it’s more likely that Airbus is putting Iran Air up to saying they’re ordering the planes but without a financial penalty for cancelling later and indeed a financial inducement for saying so. I will be genuinely surprised if Iran Air ever takes possession of new A380s.

But for now at least there’s another airline that looks to be adding the A380 into the pipeline. If it turns out to be real, I cannot wait to learn the configuration… and perhaps even to fly it!

Uber's helicopter customers will be picked up in a car first and driven to their take off point, according to the Journal.

Uber started life as a taxi-hailing app in San Francisco but it has expanded its services to rickshaws in India and boats in Turkey, amongst other services. In 2013, Uber first tested its ""UberChopper"" service in New York between Manhattan and the Hamptons. It has also offered helicopter flights at Cannes Film Festival in France and Bonnaroo Arts Festival in Nashville, USA, where it teamed up with local helicopter company Helistar Aviation.

Prices for the UberChopper service have previously ranged from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.

Airbus: Rocket venture with Safran awaits French tax ruling - SpaceNews,"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtcm9ja2V0LWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1zYWZyYW4tYXdhaXRzLWZyZW5jaC10YXgtcnVsaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KOUROU, French Guiana – Europe’s Airbus Safran Launchers joint venture company, which is leading development of the next-generation Ariane 6 rocket, has fallen behind its development schedule as it awaits a ruling by French tax officials on an expected cash payment from Safran to Airbus, Airbus Space Systems chief Francois Auque said Jan. 26.

Auque conceded that French tax authorities were asked to provide their input “a little late in the process” and that it is this delay that has stalled full implementation of the joint venture.

He implied that the schedule delays were more the fault of the joint venture partners than of the French tax people.

Airbus and Safran, whose Snecma division makes rocket motors, agreed in 2014 that they should have equal shares of the joint venture, which will lead development of Ariane 6 and also take firmer control of both the current Ariane 5 rocket and the Arianespace commercial launch consortium.

The French space agency, CNES, has agreed to sell its 35 percent stake in Arianespace to Airbus Safran Launchers for 150 million euros, or about $162 million at current exchange rates. Once completed, the transaction will give Airbus Safran Launchers a 74 percent ownership share of Arianespace.

Airbus is bringing far more assets than Safran to the joint venture, including Airbus’s work on French strategic missiles. The two companies agreed that Safran would make a cash payment of 800 million euros to balance their ownership shares.

Safran officials have not provided details to shareholders on what return the company expects on its investment, and whether it was more strategic or financial concerns that drove the decision. The space-launch market is known as a low-margin business, but the Airbus-heritage military component of the joint venture may offer returns more in line with what Safran expects of its business divisions.

Auque’s comments Jan. 26 during a press briefing in Paris did not suggest that Safran was having second thoughts about writing a check for 800 million euros, but only that Airbus wanted to weigh its options following the French authorities’ analysis of the tax consequences for Airbus.

Auque said Airbus Safran Launchers has been stuck at the approximately 400-person employment level while the two companies await the tax ruling. Ultimately the joint venture should employ more than 4,000 people, he said.

“We had planned to move to Stage 2 of the joint venture’s activities as of Dec. 31, 2015,” Auque said. “We have obviously missed that date, and every day we want now is a day of delay.”

European Space Agency governments approved the Ariane 6 rocket, and an upgraded Vega small-satellite launcher, in December 2014. In doing so, they asked ESA to structure the contract to include a Program Implementation Review in mid-2016 to be sure their multibillion-euro commitment was on track to deliver on its promise.

Ariane 6 is scheduled to make an inaugural launch in 2020 and to allow Airbus Safran Launchers to drop the commercial price of Ariane launches by between 40 and 50 percent, measured on a per-kilogram basis, compared to today’s Ariane 5.

Auque declined to provide financial results for the Airbus space division, but said its book-to-bill ratio in 2015 was “far, far superior” to 2014, which parent company Airbus viewed as a successful year for the division.

Early indications are that 2016’s harvest of commercial satellite orders will surpass 2015, he said, and permit Airbus’s space division to hire more people in addition to the nearly 1,000 new employees – including 260 from other Airbus divisions – that were hired in 2015.

The most dramatic contract for Airbus’s satellite division in 2015 was its selection by OneWeb LLC of Britain’s Channel Islands to build 900 150-kilogram OneWeb satellites to provide global Internet access.

Airbus and OneWeb on Jan. 26 announced they had formed the company, OneWeb Satellites, which will build the OneWeb constellation – 648 satellites plus spares, for a total of about 900.

The two companies said Brian Holz, OneWeb’s chief technology offer, would be chief executive of OneWeb Satellites, in which Airbus and OneWeb will have equal ownership shares.

The first 10 satellites will be built at Airbus’s Toulouse, France, facility and launched aboard Russian Soyuz rockets – either the Europeanized version operated from Europe’s spaceport here, or the fully Russian version launched form Russian territory – in 2018.

The remaining 890 OneWeb spacecraft are to be built at a U.S. facility that industry officials say is likely to be located in Florida but has not yet been announced.

Airbus also announced Jan. 26 that it had contracted with ESA to build to additional Sentinel 2 optical Earth imaging satellites as part of the European Commission’s Copernicus program.

The contract, which was expected, is valued at 285 million euros. Airbus built the Sentinel 2A and 2B satellites and was all but certain to win the follow-on order for near-identical copies to assure that Sentinel 2 data continues to flow to users through the next decade.

The first of the series, Sentinel 2A, was launched in June 2015 and is now delivering 7 terabytes per day of data, Airbus said."

Emirates airline has revealed plans to introduce its flagship Airbus A380 on routes from Dubai International Airport to Dulles International Airport, Washington D.C.

Emirates Airbus A380 will replace the existing Boeing 777-300ER used on the route daily from Dubai (DXB) to Washington D.C (IAD) from 01 February 2016. The implementation will aid growing customer demand and restore route capacity following United Airlines’ planned withdrawal from the Washington D.C. to Dubai route after 25th January 2016.

Emirates Airbus A380 to replace existing Boeing 777-300ER

Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said: “Our service to Washington D.C. has been one of our most successful and profitable routes, with high demand across all cabin classes. Despite strong seat load factors, United has made the decision to withdraw from the route. The additional seats offered by our A380 will therefore restore capacity on the route, and ensure that American consumers and international travellers wishing to visit D.C. for business or leisure will continue to be served. We look forward to offering the award-winning Emirates A380 experience to our customers, and to continue contributing to the economic success of the city and its surrounding regions.”

Timings for the daily inbound/outbound flights on the Dubai (DXB) – Washington, D.C (IAD) route will remain unchanged. As of 1st February, flight EK231 will continue to depart Dubai at 2:20 A.M. daily arriving in Washington, D.C at 8:15 A.M. Timings for the return flight, EK232 will also remain unchanged, departing Washington, D.C. at 10:15 A.M., arriving in Dubai at 8:00 A.M. the next day.

Washington Dulles International Airport to receive $50 million investment

In addition to an aircraft upgrade on flights to Washington D.C., Dulles International Airport will receive an investment of US $50 million, recently announced by Virgina Govenor Terry McAuliffe, to make the airport more competitive. This funding is expected to help support direct and indirect jobs and encourage other airlines to enhance their services."

Four California law enforcement agencies have bolstered their crime fighting and public service capabilities by taking delivery of new Airbus Helicopters H125 AStars, the highest performance, best-selling helicopter for airborne crime-fighting and rescue work.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. recently delivered six H125s, including two each to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, and one each to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Ontario Police Department.

The H125 (formerly AS350 B3e) is the latest version of the renowned AStar family of high performance, single-engine helicopters that are the benchmark in the U.S. law enforcement community. The AStar is known for its performance, reliability and multi-mission flexibility.

California Highway Patrol (CHP) took delivery of its fourth and fifth H125s, part of a five-year contract to upgrade its entire helicopter fleet. CHP has been flying AS350-series helicopters for 30 years, and the new H125s, equipped with hoists, have already performed numerous high-profile rescues across California.

Hangar One Avionics in Carlsbad, Calif. performed completion services for the CHP H125s.

LAPD recently took delivery of its second H125, part of a multi-year contract to upgrade the department’s fleet of AS350 B2 helicopters to the more capable H125. LAPD Air Support Division, customers of Airbus Helicopters for 25 years, operates its AStars 17,000 to 18,000 hours per year.

“Nobody flies as many hours as we do and our AStars perform the brunt of our missions,” said LAPD Lt. Phil Smith, one of the unit’s 45 pilots. “It was time to make the change to the H125 for the upgraded performance and safety features.”

Completion services for the LAPD aircraft are performed by the Los Angeles Department of General Services.

Ontario Police Department took delivery of its first H125, an addition to its fleet of two AS350 B2s. Ontario PD’s Air Support Unit recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, and it has been a customer of Airbus Helicopters for 15 years.

“The H125 helicopter checks all the boxes. It excels from an operations perspective, enhances safety and is economically superior, thanks to its dual hydraulics, FADEC fuel control system and increased time between overhauls,” said Sgt. Eric Weidner, unit commander for the Ontario PD Air Support Unit. “The power this aircraft affords, combined with the safety features, makes it a logical choice for us.”

Hangar One is performing completion services on the Ontario PD helicopter, which will be in-service in spring of 2016. Ontario PD is having an autopilot installed on its H125, which Weidner said will elevate the aircraft to a new level in light single engine helicopter safety and efficiency.

Riverside County Sheriff’s Office recently took delivery of two H125s, after they were completed by Hangar One. “The Airbus Helicopters AStar continues to be a workhorse for us,” said Sgt. Adam Vallejo, of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Aviation unit.

“The AStars are a versatile, multi-mission platform. We can go and do all of our missions. They are the complete law enforcement helicopter. The H125s have more power and the ability to get high and hot, which will enable us to do more work in the mountains,” Vallejo said.

“Many California agencies are replacing or upgrading their aging helicopter fleets, and the H125 AStar is the ideal platform to meet the demanding needs of California law enforcement,” said Ed Van Winkle, senior sales manager for Airborne Law Enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “These deliveries demonstrate the continued high level of trust that each agency has in Airbus Helicopters Inc. to support their operations.”

Airbus Helicopters’ H125/AS350-series are the most widely purchased helicopters by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies. More than 225 are in use nationwide with 44 different law enforcement agencies, more than 75 of them delivered in the last five years.

The H125 brings next-generation performance to the family. The H125 is powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine that delivers a higher cruise speed and is equipped with a new dual-channel FADEC and Engine Data Recorder, which enhance safety and systems management."

Iranian media quoted Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi saying Iran Air and Airbus will sign the agreement. Akhoundi has not given any specific terms, including the price of the planes.

The cost will run billions of dollars, but Iran badly needs the planes to upgrade its fleet of passenger jets, which were subject to years of sanctions and suffered from a lack of maintenance. The international agreement on the country’s nuclear program that went into effect this month removed those barriers.

Rouhani was due to visit France in November, but the trip was postponed after the terror attacks in Paris. He said then he expected Iran to sign the Airbus deal during his visit.

Rouhani will be the first Iranian president to visit France in 17 years."

Now, the “heart of Dixie” hopes to also become a major player in the aerospace sector.

That dream became a reality in September, when Airbus SAS opened an assembly line in Mobile. It is the first new manufacturer of large commercial aircraft in the United States in four decades.

The state-of-the-art facility is producing the company’s most popular airplane, the single-aisle A320. In fact, the A320 family, which includes the A318, A319 and A321 variants, is one of the world’s best-selling commercial aircraft (Boeing claims that it has delivered almost 2,000 more copies of its popular 737 jetliner vs. Airbus).

The versatile, twin-engine plane is used by hundreds of airlines for both short-haul and intercontinental routes. Airbus claims that an A320 takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2 seconds.

But, the company is not resting on its laurels. Airbus recently launched the A320neo (new engine option), which is available in several configurations ranging from 125 to 240 seats.

When it takes to the sky this year, the new aircraft will use more than 95 percent of the same airframe components as the conventional A320. But, thanks to next-generation engines being produced by Pratt & Whitney, the A320neo boasts a 20 percent fuel burn improvement per seat and an additional flight distance of 500 nautical miles.

Airbus has a huge backlog of orders for the fuel-saving aircraft. More than 75 airlines have purchased more than 4,300 A320neos, which translates into a 60 percent share of the market. That’s on top of a backlog of more than 1,200 conventional A320s.

The new plant in Mobile will help Airbus tackle that production challenge. It is modeled after three “sister” plants that also build A320 aircraft in Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Toulouse, France. Most of the aircraft assembled in Mobile will be delivered to customers in North America, including American, Delta and United airlines.

Overall, 49 of the first 50 aircraft manufactured in Alabama will be A321s, which is the longest-fuselage variant. The first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to JetBlue Airways this spring. By the end of next year, the $600 million facility will be producing four aircraft per month.

“[This factory] is an important step forward in Airbus’ strategy, strengthening our position as a leader and competitor in all of our key markets,” says Fabrice Bregier, president and CEO of Airbus. “It enables us to grow our already significant presence in America—the largest single-aisle aircraft market in the world—and to be closer to our U.S. customers and key supplier partners.

“At the same time, the expanded industrial capacity gives us more flexibility to increase production across Airbus to meet global demand,” adds Bregier. “The U.S. facility is good news for the overall Airbus enterprise, as this greater production capacity creates global growth opportunities across the company and throughout our supply chain.”

Airbus also operates a helicopter assembly plant in Columbus, MS, which opened in 2004. The 325,000-square-foot facility builds the AS350 AStar commercial helicopter and the U.S. Army’s UH-72A Lakota light utility helicopter.

Strategic Location

The new Airbus factory is located on the grounds of the Mobile Aeroplex, which has been redeveloped from a former military base. Between 1940 and 1969, the waterfront land was home to Brookley Air Force Base.

The site, which boasts a 10,000-foot-long runway, was originally selected to house a completion center for A330 aerial tankers, if the aircraft was selected by the U.S. Air Force. Airbus also proposed to build commercial A330 freighters at the site. But, those plans changed in 2011, when Boeing received the controversial contract.

One of the things that attracted Airbus to the site is its strategic location adjacent to a deepwater port. That simplifies the transportation of oversize aircraft components to the plant, eliminating the need for long trips over rail or road.

Major subassemblies are loaded onto a cargo ship in Hamburg for the 20-day journey to the Port of Mobile, which is located just three miles from the new factory. Fuselages and wings are transported to the new plant by truck.

The components are assembled at different Airbus factories in Europe. The front fuselage, including the cockpit, is built in France. The wings are produced in England. The rear fuselage is built in Germany, and the vertical tail plane is made in Spain.

“Coordinating all the logistics and complexity is a huge challenge,” says Ulrich Weber, vice president and general manager of Airbus Mobile. “Everything must come together at the same time to produce an aircraft.

“The Mobile plant incorporates all the best ideas from our factories in China, France and Germany,” adds Weber. “We examined lessons learned elsewhere and applied them to be more efficient here in the United States. For instance, we incorporated some ideas from the A350 program, including new ways of putting aircraft together with advanced technologies and production methods.”

One new assembly process is used to attach the wings to the fuselage of the A320. The Mobile plant features a state-of-the-art automatic drilling machine. It replaces a manual process used at other Airbus factories to drill more than 2,000 holes.

“We have arranged tooling and jigs in an optimal way to minimize distances between workstations,” explains Weber. “The latest ergonomic improvements have been considered to achieve the highest health and safety standard for assemblers.

“Sequenced kitting is used to ensure just-in-time delivery of fasteners and other parts,” says Weber. “We also use paperless work instructions throughout the assembly line.”

The 116-acre complex features several buildings, including offices, a transshipment hangar, a paint shop, a gauging hangar, a final phase hangar and a customer delivery center.

However, the largest building in Mobile is the 209,917-square-foot final assembly line (FAL), which can accommodate five aircraft at a time. It is a carbon copy of Hangar 9 at the Airbus factory in Hamburg.

Airbus engineers worked with systems integrator Comau Aerospace to develop assembly and test stations at the Mobile plant, including all jigs and tools.

“The assembly and test stations include the large steel fixtures that surround and hold the aircraft sections as they are assembled, allow [operators] to access the assemblies, and house the tooling and automatic drilling units used to put the aircraft together,” says Michel Pages, program manager at Comau LLC.

Assembly Line Layout

The 836-foot long FAL is divided into four workstations. The first area, known as Station 41, is where the forward and aft sections of the fuselage are joined together. The assembly process requires approximately 3,000 rivets, which are manually installed with air tools.

“This is also where we install ‘monuments,’ such as galleys and lavatories,” says Weber. “These items are too big to fit through an aircraft door, so we can’t install them after the entire fuselage is assembled.”

Station 40 is where the wings and the fuselage are joined. Assemblers on a parallel line attach winglets before the wings are joined with the fuselage. Landing gear and engine pylons are also installed here.

“All electrical and hydraulic systems are installed and connected at this workstation,” notes Weber. “And, we add power to the aircraft here so that we can begin to perform various functional tests.”

At Station 35, horizontal and vertical tail planes are attached to the fuselage. Auxiliary power units are installed and full power up of the aircraft occurs. The nose cone and radome are also installed.

“We also start installing the interior of the cabin, such as sidewall panels and linings, at this workstation,” explains Weber. “And, we furnish the cockpit.”

The final station inside the FAL is called the dock. That’s where lighting, in-flight entertainment and cabin pressurization systems are installed and tested.

“Final cabin install occurs here, including carpeting, overhead storage bins, seats and partitions,” says Weber. “Engineers also perform extensive testing of all cabin systems and landing gear.”

The FAL workstation numbering system does not follow chronological order, because various steps in the production process have been streamlined.

“When we started building the A320 several decades ago, we had more stations in between,” says Weber. “But, over the years, as we became more efficient and reshuffled work, we eliminated some of the stations. Originally, the system referred to the number of days prior to delivery.”

Overhead travelling cranes play a key role in the entire assembly process. Six cranes in the FAL operate in a series of three assembly zones.

In zone 1, three cranes support the fuselage assembly operation. The double-girder suspension cranes are 218-feet long and travel on a common crane runway. Installed on each of the crane girders is a main trolley, which accommodates four 6-ton hoist units that operate on two traversing bridges.

“Thanks to the precise control of 12 motion axes per crane, Airbus [can] position the individual fuselage sections that measure 13-feet in diameter with an extremely high level of accuracy,” claims Lutz Dowy, vice president of global product management and process cranes at Terex Material Handling & Port Solutions Corp. “To ensure that the fuselage segments are gently picked up, the cranes [are] equipped with a semiautomatic rope tensioning system.

“Once the four hoist units have each lifted a specified load of 300 kilograms, they continue to lift the suspended payload in a synchronized motion to avoid any flexing of the sensitive aircraft components,” adds Dowy.

After all fuselage segments have been assembled, the cranes transport the complete fuselage to the next assembly station. To do this, both process cranes and their eight hoist units operate under synchronized control.

In zone 2, two cranes lift the wings into position. Both are equipped with two traversing bridges and 3-ton hoist units that pick up the wings for attachment to the fuselage.

In zone 3, a crane with a 5-ton traveling hoist lifts the horizontal and vertical tail planes so that assemblers can attach them to the fuselage.

After an aircraft leaves the FAL, it is towed by tugger to the final phase hangar, where engines are attached and tested. “Any assembly work that still remains to be done and a final check is carried out here to ensure that all customer requirements have been met,” says Weber.

Future Plans

Once the nonunion Mobile plant is up to full speed, it will take 25 days to build each aircraft. The initial production rate of two aircraft per month will ramp up to four aircraft within a year.

By 2019, Airbus plans to crank up A320 production to 60 planes a month at its factories in China, France, Germany and the United States. That kind of production volume would be unprecedented in the commercial aerospace industry.

Airbus already leases an adjacent plot of land that could easily accommodate future expansion. In fact, industry observers believe it’s a matter of “when” rather than “if.”

“I expect Airbus to move more production to the United States in the future to get away from the union problems that they face in Europe,” says Hans Weber, president of TECOP International Inc., an aerospace consulting firm.

“Airbus will be more competitive in Alabama than they can ever expect to be in France or Germany,” claims Weber. “Long term, the Mobile plant could surpass China in terms of strategic importance to the company.”

According to Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corp., the threat of future expansion in Mobile sends a strong message to the unions back in Europe.

“Having a strong presence here should enable Airbus to procure future U.S. defense contracts,” adds Aboulafia. “Diversifying their currency cost base is also a good idea, because Airbus has had problems competing in the past when the Euro has been strong.”

The new Airbus assembly line has already attracted several aerospace suppliers, and more are expected to eventually set up shop in the Mobile area.

“Alabama has a long history in aerospace and aviation, but the future looks even brighter because of major developments like the Airbus production launch,” says Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “Our aerospace and aviation sector is poised to reach new altitudes in coming years as major industry players expand their Alabama operations.”

The Mobile Aeroplex complex has already seen a burst of activity from aerospace companies such as AAA Aerospace USA (engine installation and wheel assembly); MAAS Aviation (paint shop); and REEL USA Corp. (platforms, jigs and material handling tools).

At the Paris Air Show last summer, Hutchinson Corp. (anti-vibration and thermo-acoustic insulation systems) announced that it plans to set up an Aerospace Manufacturing Center of Excellence in Mobile to serve Airbus. Another French company, Safran, is building a facility to house several of its subsidiaries, including Aircelle (engine nacelles) and Messier-Buggatti-Dowty (landing gear and brake systems).

Airbus said it received 1,036 orders for its jets in 2015, well above the 768 achieved by Seattle-based Boeing. The tally sees Airbus’s order book soar to 6,787 jets valued at almost $1 trillion, compared to Boeing’s 5,795. The order backlog, Airbus says, is equivalent of almost a decade’s worth of production.

While Airbus took the sales title, the Boeing delivered more aircraft last year, producing 762 new jets in 2015 compared with the 635 by Airbus, although both, notably, were record performances.

JetBlue announced on Monday that it is ready to overhaul the cabins of its Airbus A320 jets.

The carrier say the long-awaited “restyling” of all 130 of its A320s marks the first complete redesign of A320 interiors since JetBlue launched in 2000. JetBlue launched that year with an all-A320 fleet, but has since added Embraer E190s (in 2005) and bigger Airbus A321s to its fleet (in 2013).

The A320 cabin overhaul will include the addition of JetBlue’s “Fly-Fi gate-to-gate” high-speed Internet as well as new high-definition seatback TV screens. JetBlue also will add power outlets and USB ports at every seat.

“We launched JetBlue with a customer-focused experience that no one expected from an airline,” Jamie Perry, JetBlue’s VP of brand and product development, says in a statement. “Travel preferences have changed in the last 15 years, and we’re investing in what customers want today. Our new cabin, combined with our award-winning customer service, is a powerful way for us to once again challenge the status quo.”

But fliers also will have to make a few sacrifices.

Bloomberg News notes the seating capacity on the A320s will jump to 162 from 150, resulting in a “seat pitch” of 32 inches. That resulting seat pitch – an industry term for the space between seats – will ended up “two inches less than in the current configuration,” Bloomberg writes. Still, JetBlue claims its economy seats will have the most legroom of all U.S. carriers ""based on average seat pitch.""

JetBlue officials say the restyling is partially an attempt to make the A320 cabin interiors more similar to the interiors found on the airline’s newer A321s, which get higher ratings from customers.

“What we have seen is that the A321 aircraft is about 10% higher [in customer ratings] than the A320,” JetBlue’s Perry says to Skift reporter Marisa Garcia.

""We've seen a fantastic uptick in customer satisfaction with the new (A321 coach) seats,"" Perry adds to Barbara Peterson of Conde Nast Traveler. “Some of these earlier seats are 16 years old, and it is time for a change.""

Abbas Akhondi was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that the first shipment of planes will arrive in Iran before March 20 to upgrade Iran’s aging fleet. Iran has said it is looking to buy 400 passenger planes over the next decade.

“An agreement was reached with Airbus to buy 114 planes to gradually enter carrier Iran Air fleet upon the lifting of sanctions,” IRNA quoted Akhondi as saying.

He said an unspecified number of planes will arrive before Nowruz, Iran’s new year, which falls on March 21.

Airbus did not confirm a formal agreement with Tehran. The company released a statement pointing out that the sanctions have yet to be lifted and the nuclear agreement has yet to be implemented. “Once it is, we will evaluate the commercial implications in strict compliance with any international accord,” the statement said. “Airbus Group remains ready to support Iranian civil and para-public transportation sector development in strict compliance with all international laws.”

Iran is already waiting for the imminent release of a UN compliance report that would trigger the lifting of sanctions under a landmark deal reached with world powers last July over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.

Iran’s aviation industry has suffered as a result of sanctions over the past three decades. Out of Iran’s 250 commercial planes, about 150 are flying while the rest are grounded due to lack of spare parts.

Akhondi said Iran is already planning to also renovate its aviation industry by leasing planes since the country’s airlines lack the financial liquidity to buy too many aircraft at once. He urged Iranian carriers to take steps to upgrade their fleets in the post-sanctions era.

“With the implementation of the nuclear deal, we will enter a new atmosphere in our interaction with the outside world and subsequently develop our aviation industry,” he said."

In December, Airbus Group said it was on the verge of selecting a final candidate and expected a decision by the end of the month. Sources familiar with the talks estimate the value of the assets at around 1 billion euros.

""It is progressing well,"" Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer Marwan Lahoud, who is in charge of the negotiations, told Reuters when asked if a deal had been reached.

People familiar with the matter said Airbus Group had shortlisted Carlyle and KKR after two U.S. buyout groups put in significantly higher offers.

- OneWeb Satellites is a joint venture equally owned by Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb - Company to design and build 900 satellites for OneWeb, as well as satellites for other future constellations marketed by Airbus Defence and Space

Airbus Defence and Space, the world’s second largest space company, and OneWeb, which is building a new global satellite communications system, announced the creation of OneWeb Satellites. The new joint venture, equally owned by Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb, will design and build the 900 satellites of the OneWeb constellation, which will offer high-speed internet with global coverage. The new company will be led by Brian Holz as CEO.

OneWeb Satellites will also be able to build satellites, platforms and equipment to be marketed by Airbus Defence and Space to other operators of future constellations.

“The next stage of the OneWeb adventure is here! On both sides of the Atlantic, our teams are now working under a common flag to meet the incredible challenge: to mass-produce 900 satellites for the OneWeb constellation,” said Eric Béranger, Head of Programmes Space Systems. “For several months now, we have been working on the design of this unprecedented constellation and how we are going to manufacture them – both ground-breaking in their own way. The next step will be to set up a prototype line in Toulouse for production of the first 10 satellites. This will also be used to test the industrialisation method for the series production of the other satellites.”

""Airbus is a key partner to our success as we move forward and are very happy to have them being a part of OneWeb and our new joint venture. We are benefiting from Airbus Defence and Space’s manufacturing and assembly knowledge as we look to initiate services,” said Matt O’Connell, CEO of OneWeb. “As we build out the constellation, besides its very reliable satellite performance heritage and technical support, Airbus brings design for manufacturing capability into this operation which is key to achieving both our short term and long term goals for providing cost effective solutions on time for our future customers,” O’Connell added.

OneWeb Satellites will undertake design activities for the entire satellite fleet and the manufacture of the first 10 flight models will take place in France, with the first ever mass production of the operational satellites planned for North America. Each satellite will weigh less than 150 kg and will operate in low Earth orbit. They will be launched by Arianespace and Virgin Galactic starting from 2018 and reach their orbital positions using electrical propulsion.

This prototype is the first to fly with the 1,100 shp Turbomeca (Safran) Arrano engines.

This is the second of three planned flying prototypes that Airbus will use on its way to certification, which is targeted for 2018. The first prototype has accumulated more than 75 hours of flight testing.

The H160 is tailored to a variety of flight operations including oil and gas, emergency medical services, public service and private- and business aviation.

New technologies incorporated into the H160 include a large Fenestron encasing a double-canted tail rotor, a Biplane Stabilizer that aids with low-speed flight and hover characteristics, and Blue Edge main rotor blades, the tips of which are severely angled, which Airbus says help increase the payload and reduce the noise footprint by as much as 50 percent.

Performance targets for the H160 include a cruise speed of 160 knots and a maximum range of 450 nm for public service and SAR missions.

Latest delivery brings total H135 fleet of Polish operator LPR to 27 units



New rotorcr

Warsaw – Poland’s public air medical rescue operator LPR (SP ZOZ Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe) has received four new H135 (formerly known as EC135P3) helicopters to extend its Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) operations in Poland. This latest delivery brings the total H135 LPR fleet to 27 units.Prior to this on-time and on-quality delivery of four new H135s, an intensive technical acceptance process took place in December 2015 at Airbus Helicopters’ Donauwörth site in Germany. All helicopters were subsequently transferred to the main LPR base in Warsaw. The total fleet of 27 H135 helicopters is now fully operational with LPR, representing a major step in the modernization of the country’s helicopter-based medical evacuation services and making Poland one of the world’s largest users of this helicopter in its new-generation EMS configuration.“Airbus Helicopters is committed to providing Poland with state-of-the-art and reliable helicopters to carry out emergency service duties” said Mickael Peru, Managing Director at Airbus Helicopters Polska. “We also ensure that these aircraft can be autonomously maintained in-country and in full accordance with the operator’s requirements. This latest delivery is yet another example of the excellent cooperation with our Polish customer and demonstrates once again our ability to fulfil all our contractual obligations”, he added.The agreement for the delivery of four new H135 helicopters to LPR was signed on 4 August 2015, following a competitive public tender procedure won by Airbus Helicopters. The LPR fleet has an average availability rate of over 95 percent. All helicopters have been equipped according to the required specification including in between the sophisticated avionics, full NVG certification, and a fully equipped state of the art EMS cabin.Airbus Helicopters has delivered nearly 1,200 helicopters of the H135-family to customers around the globe, which have logged more than 3 million flight hours. One-quarter of this total fleet is deployed for EMS duties.In the present organizational structure of the Polish Medical Air Rescue, LPR (SP ZOZ Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe) was created in 2000, yet it is the heir to the traditions of the Polish pre- and postwar medical aviation. LPR performs tasks connected both with medicine and aviation: medical emergency, air transfer of patients between the hospitals, air transfer of patients from abroad to Poland, air transfer of patients to the hospitals outside Poland. The Polish Medical Air Rescue operates from 17 bases in Poland. In each of them there is a helicopter medical emergency crew on duty, consisting of a pilot, paramedic/nurse and physician. Additionaly, it is on call with a plane medical emergency crew, which is stationed in a military zone of Warsaw-Okęcie airport. The head office of the Polish Medical Air Rescue is located in Warsaw.Airbus Helicopters is a division of Airbus Group, a global pioneer in aerospace and defense related services.

Airbus seems to have finally found a new customer for its A380 Superjumbo.

Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier announced this week at the company's annual meeting that it had a firm order for three aircraft from an undisclosed ""global leading airline.""

Bregier said the airline requested that Airbus not yet disclose the buyer's identity, but Nikkei has reported that the mystery airline is Japan's All Nippon Airways.

This would be the first airline to purchase the A380 since Emirates placed an order in late 2013.

According to Nikkei, ANA plans to deploy the three double-deckers to ferry tourists back and forth from Tokyo to Hawaii. The deal is valued at just over $1.2 billion.

This A380 order seems to have been a couple of years in the making, with the Japanese carrier reportedly looking into the airliner as far back as 2014. ANA is expected to take delivery of its A380s starting in 2018.

Airbus has sold 319 of the massive jets over the past decade and a half.

Emirates alone accounts for 140 of the orders. There are 179 examples of the aircraft in service around the world with 13 airlines.

The news around the A380 is still not completely rosy. This week, Virgin Atlantic Airways, which has a long-delayed outstanding order for six A380s, reportedly ordered 12 A350-1000 wide-body airliners to replace the airline's aging Boeing 747-400 leisure fleet.

Last year, Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger told Business Insider the airline would accept delivery of the A380s only if there was enough capacity for all six jets.

Introduction

January 04, 2016, © Leeham Co.: We have discussed if the Boeing 767-300ER could function as a stopgap until an NMA would be available. We then compared it with Boeing's 787-8 and Airbus' A330-800 as alternative stopgaps. We didn't include any single-aisle alternatives at the time, like Airbus' A321LR or Boeing’s 737 MAX 10.

These aircraft have limitations in passenger capacity and range compared with the 767. The least compromised aircraft in an NMA role is the A321LR, which comes within 1,500nm of the range of the 767-300ER. We, therefore, use it as our single-aisle alternative when we look at further stopgaps until an NMA arrives in 7-10 years.

The next time you're impatiently staring at your phone screen, waiting for your ride to arrive, you might want to look up every few minutes — you know, to see whether your UberChopper has landed yet. The Wall Street Journal reports that Airbus and Uber have formed an ambitious-sounding partnership for an on-demand helicopter service that launches (quite literally) at the Sundance Festival this week. Tom Enders, the CEO of Airbus, told the Journal:

""Its a pilot project, we’ll see where it goes — but it’s pretty exciting.""

Is an on-demand helicopter service really what anyone needs? Uber hopes that it is, especially if it wants to stay ahead of Lyft, which is increasingly biting at Uber's heels (or its back bumpers). According to The Guardian, Uber executives were surprised by the General Motors-led $1 billion investment in Lyft and with the other ridesharing company's new valuation. And the obvious solution is helicopters. Ok, fine. That is not the obvious solution, but you do you, Uber.

Uber has tested the UberChopper on a handful of occasions, offering flights from New York City to the Hamptons, to events like the Bonnaroo and Coachella music festivals and, most recently, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The cost of the service has ranged from $99 for a night tour of the Vegas strip to several thousand dollars. At Sundance, a 15-minute flight from the Salt Lake City Airport to Park City will cost $200 during the day, $300 at night.

Uber will use Airbus H125 and H130 helicopters for the service, and will work with a Utah-based helicopter operator. If you're at the festival and want to order an UberChopper, there will be an option on the app screen that says CHOPPER. An Uber (the wheeled kind) will then be dispatched to pick you up and deliver you to your helicopter, which should give you plenty of opportunities for selfies along the way.

Reuters reports that Uber founder Travis Kalanick was asked about the service while speaking to students at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai. He said:

""The point is if you can push a button and can get a ride, then why not push a button and get a helicopter?""

He did not give any additional details about the service, where it would be available or when it would have a more widespread launch. He did say that it was ""more for fun."" That seems fair."
Airbus tops Boeing in orders for 2015 - Canadian Metalworking,"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFkaWFubWV0YWx3b3JraW5nLmNvbS9jYW5hZGlhbm1ldGFsd29ya2luZy9uZXdzL21ldGFsd29ya2luZy9haXJidXMtdG9wLWJvZWluZy1pbi1vcmRlcnMtZm9yLTIwMTXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus overcame engine delays to win hundreds more plane orders in 2015 than rival Boeing, but a bigger problem may cloud this year for both companies: China's economic slowdown.

Airbus SA and Boeing Co. are battling to win market share in China, forecast to become the world's biggest air travel market in a little more than a decade. But concerns about China's plunging financial markets and slowing growth are rippling throughout Asia, where a growing middle class has driven demand for new airplanes in recent years.

Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier largely shrugged off the recent market turmoil on Tuesday, insisting that his Toulouse, France-based company is sticking to plans for a new facility in Tianjin next month and to its overall strategy in China.

""We should not mix up problems we can see on the financial markets and the real economy,'' he told reporters in Paris, in presenting Airbus' annual orders and forecast for the year.

Bregier predicted that new U.S. visa policies would boost Chinese air travel, and that Asian middle class demand would continue to grow.

As its economy slows, China is trying to shift its focus away from manufacturing toward consumer spending. That could help increase air travel, but only if the economy does not suffer a sharp drop.

Chicago-based Boeing reached a deal last year to build an assembly plant in China, as the U.S. company tries to match Airbus's presence in the world's second-largest economy.

China, too, is trying to get in on the industry. Chinese state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. has unveiled the first plane produced by a Chinese initiative to compete in the market for large passenger jetliners, the C919. Bregier downplayed the potential Chinese challenger.

Airbus executives remain upbeat about the overall aviation industry despite signs that aircraft demand is slowing. Industry association IATA recently lowered its long-term air traffic forecast and warned that low oil prices have hurt prospects in key emerging markets such as Russia and Brazil.

Airbus is ramping up production in 2016, especially of the new A350 wide-body, to keep up with the pace of orders—and to try to catch up with Boeing's dominance in aircraft deliveries.

Increased automation and ``digitalization''—including 3D printing of some plane components—will be key to boosting production, Bregier said.

Airbus said Tuesday that it exceeded its targets in 2015, taking in 1,036 net orders and delivering 635 jets to airlines and other buyers. The manufacturer says it has a backlog of 6,787 aircraft worth $996.3 billion at list prices, though customers usually negotiate discounts.

Boeing says on its website that it took in 768 orders last year and delivered 762 aircraft.

Boeing had more success selling big-budget wide-body jets such as the 787. Most of the planes Airbus sold were from the single-aisle A320 range of jets.

Airbus hopes to deliver more than 650 planes this year. Bregier said the proportion of single-aisle versus longer-haul jets would remain roughly the same.

The company's top-selling plane, the A320neo, suffered last-minute engine delays and is only being delivered to its first customer this month. Airbus also faced certification and production problems with a company supplying seats and toilets for the A350, Zodiac Aerospace.

Airbus announced a late firm order for three A380 superjumbos—its first sale for the costly 500-seater in all of 2015. The planemaker wouldn't reveal the customer, though it's reported to be Japan's All Nippon Airways.

Chief salesman John Leahy said the A380 is ""still very important to us'' despite slack sales, and the company hopes to break even on the program this year."

Airbus A340-200

Airbus A340-500 STANDARD DATA: A340-300 Seats 335. Gross wt. 606,275. Empty wt. 287,050. Engines four 32,550-lb. International CFM56-5C3 turbofans.

PERFORMANCE: Max speed 494 kts. Economy cruise 475 kts. Ceiling 41,000′. Range 7,450 nm.

The 330 and 340 Airbus were developed at the same time, and both aircraft have the same flightdeck with side stick controllers and fly-by-wire controls. The shortened A340-200 first flew in April 1992, and trades seating capacity (263-303 passengers) for greater range. The A340 can carry about 330 passengers with a range of 7,100-7,450 nm.

The 500 and 600 series are currently the world’s longest-range airliners. The 500 can travel 8,500 nm, enabling nonstop flights like Los Angeles to Singapore. The A600’s first flight was in April of 2001, and was certified 13 months later.

The A500’s maiden flight was in February of 2002 and received its certification just 10 months later. Both models are direct competition for Boeing’s long range 747-400.

Bahrain’s national carrier to upgrade its fleet with fuel-efficient single aisle aircraft

Gulf Air – which currently operates 28 Airbus aircraft – has announced a firm order for 29 A320neo Family aircraft, including 17 A321neo and 12 A320neo jetliners. Ten of the A320neo aircraft have been confirmed in 2012

As part of its fleet renewal strategy, Gulf Air has announced a firm order of 29 A320neo Family. The new order includes 17 A321neo and 12 A320neo of which 10 A320neo have been confirmed in 2012. The contract was signed today at the Bahrain International Airshow between Mr. Maher Salman Al Musallam, A/Chief Executive Officer, Gulf Air and Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer, in the presence of H.E. Kamal bin Ahmed Mohammed, Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications, Kingdom of Bahrain and Mr Matthias Fekl, Minister of State for Foreign Trade, the Promotion of Tourism and French Nationals Abroad.Gulf Air currently operates 28 Airbus aircraft; and the new aircraft will fit seamlessly into the airline’s current fleet, thanks to Airbus’ overall fleet commonality, its low operating costs, optimum fuel efficiency and best-in-class passenger comfort of any single aisle aircraft.Commenting on the agreement, Gulf Air A/Chief Executive Officer Mr. Maher Salman Al Musallam, said, “I am delighted that we will enhance and simplify our fleet structure building on Airbus aircraft. This restructured order meets Gulf Air’s future fleet requirement and our network expansion plans. As a result, I now look forward to furthering Gulf Air’s fleet modernization process while supporting our network and overall passenger experience enhancement strategies.”“We are pleased that Gulf Air has chosen the A320neo Family to complement its long-term growth strategy. The fuel efficient aircraft will provide the airline with a higher operational efficiency and profitability while its wider cabins will open a new dimension of passenger appeal,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer.The A320neo Family incorporates latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklet wing tip devices, which together deliver more than 15 percent in fuel savings from day one and 20 percent by 2020 with further cabin innovations. With nearly 4,500 orders received from some 80 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured a 60 percent share of the market."

Airbus have released their price list for 2016. Expect eye-watering prices for these new planes… if you’re paying out of your own pocket.

Want an Airbus A350-900? That’ll be US$308.1 million please… Yes, we accept cash. Pocket change if you’re waiting for this weeks Powerball… – Image, Airbus.

If you’re a bank or a leasing company, the money you need is behind the sofa.



Want an A318 instead? Cute little jet? A mere snip at US$75.1 million. Image, Economy Class and Beyond.

So let’s have a look. Prices are in Millions of US$ (which of course, we all have in our bank accounts):



Data – Airbus: http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/new-airbus-aircraft-list-prices-for-2016/

Of course, prices are subject to many other things such as engines, design wegihts and how far you customise your aircraft.

There’s probably discount for quantities too. Because, I doubt any airline/leasing company pays the full price for an aircraft (especilly when airlines and leasing companies order 50 at a time)..

None the less, if you ever fancied playing Airline CEO, these are just he prices for the frames alone – let alone options, fitting, fuel, crews, safety cases…. To name but a few costs.

Or as I stated at the beginning of the article – if you’re a billionaire, and want to sink to become a millionaire, step right up!

On the plus side, you’ll have some nice planes to play with when the billions are gone…

The New York-based airline announced earlier that it bought 15 A321ceo and 20 of the new more fuel-efficient A321neo aircraft as it looked to revamp its fleet.

It also opted to upsize eight A320ceo aircraft and 10 A320neo planes currently on backlog to the same number of bigger, more expensive A321ceos and A321neos, respectively.

In a statement, JetBlue CEO Dave Barger said the increased order of the A321s, which it believes are ideal for its high-density markets, will help it to “better match capacity with demand.”

The aircraft will help power its Mint premium service on the New York-Los Angeles and New York-San Francisco markets.

“It is the right aircraft for JetBlue's lucrative routes,” Barger said.

The announcement came the same day that JetBlue reported a weaker-than-expected profit on higher costs. Expenses for fuel were up 4%, while costs for maintenance materials and repairs jumped 28%.

Airbus, which competes with U.S. jet maker Boeing for airline demand, has been selling the A320 since 1984. It has sold about 2,400 of the next-generation neo jets since the program launched, and the first neos are expected to be delivered in 2015."

Nathen Sieben Photo

Marking a milestone for both Pacific Helicopters and aviation operations in Papua New Guinea, the company has taken delivery of the first of three H145 helicopters from Airbus Helicopters. The first H145, leased from international lessor, Waypoint Leasing, has arrived in the Eastern Highlands Provincial capital of Goroka, following final reassembly at Airbus Group Australia Pacific’s Sydney facility.

The remaining two H145s, purchased and owned by Pacific Helicopters, will be delivered later this year.

This H145 is the first new Airbus Helicopters aircraft to be operated in Papua New Guinea, with Pacific Helicopters setting a new industry standard in a country steeped in aviation history and offering an even brighter future. Operators are increasingly looking for high-performance, efficient rotorcraft with strong safety credentials and oil and gas operational compliance–key characteristics of the Airbus Helicopters family.

“As a result of the introduction of the H145, and the demonstration flights carried out in Port Moresby, Pacific Helicopters is confident that their prospects for future business opportunities within the PNG [Papua New Guinea] minerals and resources industry are very exciting,” said Malcolm Smith-Kela, Pacific Helicopters owner and CEO.

With its versatile configuration, Pacific Helicopters H145s are able to perform a variety of tasks, including defense force support, emergency medical services, law enforcement, government department duties, oil and gas, aerial work, and business and private passenger transport.

“The H145 is a powerful, comfortable, modern and versatile multi-purpose rotorcraft, already produced with a large range of options to perform a broad mission spectrum that is also ideal for the support of the oil and gas industry here in PNG [Papua New Guinea],” explained Nicole Demosky, Pacific Helicopters’ marketing manager.

To further support Pacific Helicopters and its pilots, Airbus Group is providing H145 flight crew training and Power By the Hour support from the company’s Sydney base.

“The H145 is the latest variant of the popular high-performance, twin-engine range from Airbus Helicopters,” said Tony Fraser, managing director of Airbus Group Australia Pacific. “We are proud to grow our partnership with Pacific Helicopters and support them as they continue to expand their operations, particularly in the demanding flying environment of Papua New Guinea.”"

Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department and Airbus Helicopters signed an agreement for an order of one H155 medium helicopter for police, law enforcement and other public services, to be delivered in the beginning of 2017.

Mission equipment for Shaanxi’s H155 includes a powerful searchlight, an electrical hoist and rappelling system, firefighting equipment, and a loud speaker.

“The H155 will be a valuable asset for the security of Shaanxi residents,” said Norbert Ducrot, president of Airbus Helicopters in China. “It is a highly efficient helicopter which has proven its capabilities worldwide in a variety of public services missions, and is already being deployed within China, in Shanghai, Dalian, Fuzhou and Hong Kong.”

The H155’s high speed and long endurance make it an ideal tool for police missions, as they can effectively help ground forces to accomplish a multitude of operations including air patrol, transportation of police force, firefighting, search and rescue, traffic dispersion and air command.

With the largest cabin and lift capacity in its class, the H155 can transport police units of up to 12 members to the incident area. Equipment can easily be loaded into the large baggage compartment. The H155 offers unmatched visibility and a discrete sound level for effective surveillance operations.

The wide range of Airbus Helicopters products, from light, medium, to heavy rotorcraft, are utilized in various public services missions, with the company leading this segment in China with about 35 percent market share today."
Review: South African Airways Business Class Airbus A340... - God Save The Points,"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL3NvdXRoYWZyaWNhbmJ1c2luZXNzcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African Airways Flight #327 Johannesburg, SA (JNB) to Cape Town, SA (CPT) September 9th 2015

South Africa is incredible, getting there is somewhat less so. There are very few direct flights from major European cities into Cape Town Airport, zero from the US and few from elsewhere. It essentially means that almost all of you hoping to visit the seaside city, set along the foothills of Table Mountain, which is so beautiful it might as well be a dreamed up movie set, will connect through Johannesburg. In doing so, I grabbed paid business class tickets, which were relatively cheap, flexible and offered flights at the same price on South African’s long haul Airbus A340’s, the same planes that serve many of their most famous far away cities…

Check In + Lounge

Checking in, coming off our Virgin Atlantic flight was a breeze. There were no lines and since we were traveling without checked luggage, no added hassle. We did have some help…

South African operates very solid lounges with tea sandwiches, breakfast pastries, fruits, and some hot selections during meal time. As evidenced by the disgraceful double fisting in this photo, I was most interested in the South African wine.

The Seat + Bed

Most flights between Johannesburg and Cape Town are operated by domestically configured (crappy seats) 737’s. I found the flights in their schedule that featured large, wide body aircraft with international business class seats. The cabin is arranged in a 2x2x2 layout, with very wide, cozy seats. If you’re traveling alone you’ll want to snag an aisle for direct access. We grabbed 1J and 1K offering a roomy bulkhead at the front.

Laura settling in nicely to a space with enough legroom for an NBA star.

And shortly after taking off, settling turned to settled, which prompted this sinister photo opportunity. No one is safe!

I might have pushed the buttons to begin the recline process…, which by the way does go fully flat and features a massage function.

Ah yes, fully flat. The seats feature a foot stool, which Laura has chosen not to use, which can be excellent for pushing off while sleeping. It’s one of the most surprisingly useful things on a plane. Two and a half hours of this photo on repeat and we were there. Meanwhile…

Food + Drink

Once we reached cruising altitude we were greeted by name and offered a nice light cold snack, this one was couscous with tossed and seasoned beef, accompanied by some nice fruit. It was a safe, easy bite with lots of flavor thanks to the spices. To my understanding, long haul international flights offer a very refined three to five course menu, far beyond this offering.

It’s not coffee! Ok, it is, but it has Amarula, an African treasure of a liqueur in it! Creamy and rich like Baileys but dare I say better?! On long haul flights they serve Taittinger Brut. On this flight I didn’t find any, and that’s ok.

The Experience + Tips

As I mentioned briefly we had a rather unique experience upon landing, as we were greeted at the plane door on the tarmac and whisked into a private vehicle thanks to a test of Gateway VIP Services. The tips are really simple on this one. If you’re flying internationally on a long flight this is the cabin you’ll get, you’ll also receive much more food and alcohol. If you’re looking at flights to connect short haul, this is the best possible way to fly between Cape Town and Johannesburg. It’s spacious, quiet and it’s the same price. Find a flight number operated by an A330 or A340 and enjoy the improved seat and less turbulence.

Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph Watch For Airbus Corporate Jets Hands-On - aBlogtoWatch,"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vcmljaGFyZC1taWxsZS1ybS01MC0wMi1hY2otdG91cmJpbGxvbi1zcGxpdC1zZWNvbmRzLWNocm9ub2dyYXBoLXdhdGNoLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Debuted at SIHH 2016 is this new and truly awesome (in both price and design) aviation watch from Richard Mille designed in collaboration with Airbus’ private jet division. ACJ stands for “Airbus Corporate Jets” and this arm of the French airplane company produces jetliners for usually 20-50 passengers for the ultra-wealthy, corporations, or even governments. ACJ chose to partner with Richard Mille, and this rather interesting Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph watch is the result.

According to Richard Mille and ACJ, the companies spent about two years working on the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph limited edition watch. What makes the watch so unique are the many Airbus plane-inspired design elements. I know that some people will no doubt dislike this watch, just as all Richard Mille timepieces have their friends and foes. I will admit that on paper, nothing about the design of this watch works. The colors, design inspirations, and overall explanation of the shape makes the watch sound insane to silly, but in person and on the wrist, it totally works. I can say that the present aBlogtoWatch team fell in love with the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph at first sight. Not that it matters, since the $1,000,000-plus watch is not likely to ever have a permanent place on our wrists. I should also mention that the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph is one of those watches that looks much better in person than in its marketing pictures (which is, ironically, usually the other way around).

Advertising Message

The most notable plane-inspired design element of the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph is the dial which is meant to look like a curved rectangular plane window. Other “jet” design elements include the wheel and tire-style crown, Airbus ACJ logo and other symbols on the side of the case, and the modern plane instrument readout-inspired hands and dial design. The dial colors are a bit loud, but it really does go with the theme well.

Very light on the wrist in mostly titanium and some alloy, the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph is 42.70mm wide and 50.10mm tall by 16.50mm thick. Another distinctive element is the white ceramic bezel plate. On it are small versions of Airbus’s own special tension screws which adds an additional level of distinctiveness to the design.

In typical Richard Mille character, detailing and finishing are hyper-meticulous on the case as well as movement. Inside the watch is an in-house movement that isn’t technically new, but with a lot of new parts and some new materials, it feels quite new. You’ll notice an interesting, almost oxidized-bronze look to some of the movement parts – these are actually coated with a special anti-corrosive material used in Airbus planes. I can’t say that it has an enormously functional element in the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph, but it is pretty cool-looking. The movement itself is deep with a lot of character as well as functionality.

Advertising Message

The Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph watch has a new version of Richard Mille’s tourbillon split second chronograph manually wound movement. Much of the dial is a piece of sapphire crystal, but the tourbillon (with bridge) and mainspring barrel bridge have their own openings. The 60-minute split-second (rattrapante) chronograph is joined with a power reserve indicator, movement torque indicator, and crown selection indicator. There is, of course, the tourbillon as well which doubles as the running seconds indicator.

Bright colors are clearly more and more important to Richard Mille as the brand founder and creative soul continues to release watches with brightly toned dials (such as this RM 60-1 Automatic Flyback Chronograph For St. Barth) as well cases in unique materials such as NTPT Quartz. It is easy for horology traditionalists to shun these designs, but for those who are wealthy and edgy, it is difficult to go from a more conservative watch to a Richard Mille, and then back again.

In addition to the titanium case, most of the calibre RM50-02 manually movement inside of the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph is in titanium – albeit very nicely polished and finished titanium. The extreme level of effort and finishing is clear, and Richard Mille himself seems to enjoy really pushing the envelope not merely on a movement’s functional complexity, but architectural complexity as well. The tourbillon-based movement operates at 3Hz (21,600 bph) and has a power reserve of about 70 hours.

In fact, at its heart, the Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph is a very traditional Richard Mille (within a very non-traditional brand) watch with some unique design elements for a special partner (ACJ). That said, what makes it unique does not take away from the core wearing and functional experience that makes a Richard Mille a Richard Mille. This watch feels like a successful blend between something familiar and something new within a brand that continues to be mega hot despite is pricing which is attainable for the 1% of the 1%.

The people who purchase Airbus’ large private jets are also no doubt the perfect target demographic for this type of limited edition watch. Why not pony up an extra million for a watch that goes really well with your shiny new ACJ319 plane? The Richard Mille RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Second Chronograph watch is a limited edition of 30 pieces and is priced at $1,050,000. richardmille.com"

The first A320neo to be delivered to Lufthansa, along with top brass of United Technologies, Pratt & Whitney, Lufthansa and Airbus. Shame Lufthansa couldn’t afford to paint the word “neo” next to the designation of it’s new plane.



For both Airbus and Lufthansa, its a big leap forward as the A320neo moves from an idea to a test aircraft to a product that can be sold and delivered to customers.

The changes for the A320neo are focused on the engines – the engines delivered on the first A320neo to Lufthansa feature Pratt & Whitney PurePower Geared Turbofan engines along with aerodynamic improvements and Sharklets wingtip devices – giving 15% less fuel burn than current aircraft.

Initial planes have been certified with the Pratt & Whitney Engine, whilst planes with CFM International LEAP-1A engine will fly at a late date.

With Lufthansa becoming the first customer to have their A320neo delivered, Qatar Airways (who was originally meant to have the first A320neo delivered) will now be the second carrier to fly, followed by Indigo of India.

Lufthansa intend to introduce the A320neo into service on the 24th January 2016 between Frankfurt and Hamburg – however, no exact flight details have been revealed yet.

Airbus has a lot of work to do with the A320neo Family – with almost 4,500 orders received from nearly 80 customers since its launch in 2010, there’s a lot of aircraft to be built.

All Nippon Airways will buy the A380 super jumbo - Business Insider,"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc2FsZXMtMjAxNi0x0gE8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zYWxlcy0yMDE2LTE_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus

Airbus confirmed Friday that Japan's All Nippon Airways will become the latest airline to buy the A380 super jumbo.

The Japanese carrier will become the country's first operator of the aircraft type with the addition of three double-deckers to its fleet.

News of the ANA deal comes just one day after Airbus confirmed the sale of 12 A380s to Iran Air as part of a 118-aircraft, $25 billion order.

This week's two deals mark a dramatic conclusion to the A380's sales drought that saw Airbus go more than two years without an airline order for the jet.

""We are extremely proud to welcome ANA Group as a new customer for the A380,"" Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier said in a statement.

""As one of the world’s most prestigious airlines, ANA Group will be able to benefit from the A380’s proven operating economics and unrivaled passenger appeal.""

Prior to the ANA and Iran Air orders, the last time Airbus received an airline order for the A380 was at the end of 2013 when Emirates bought a batch.

The sharp decline in fuel prices over the past year may have made the four-engined widebody attractive once again to airlines.

According to Airbus, the company has generated 319 firm orders for the aircraft since it went on sale more than a decade ago. However, those order numbers have been greatly helped by the plane's single largest supporter — Emirates. Of the 319 A380s orders, 140 have been by the Dubai-based airline.

Rumors of the ANA deal popped up earlier this month, but neither the airline nor Airbus could offer a confirmation at the time.

ANA is expected to initially deploy the A380s on its Tokyo to Honolulu route when it takes delivery in 2019.

With the ability to carry as many as 544 passenger per plane, the super jumbo will allow ANA to increase capacity at its slot-constrained Tokyo Haneda hub.

Propulsion for the ANA A380s will come from Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines."

Certification is expected in the second quarter of 2017. Bell Helicopter Image

One would think that with the depressed oil prices that have prevailed for the past year, the mood of the helicopter manufacturers that have new aircraft specifically aimed at the deepwater market — AgustaWestland’s AW189, Airbus Helicopters’ H175, and Bell Helicopter’s 525 Relentless — would be equally depressed.

Just as these helicopters are aimed at the long haul when it comes to their deepwater mission objectives, so are their respective manufacturers aiming at the long haul — 15 to 20 years — for these aircraft, which fall into the 16,000- to 20,000-pound (7,257- to 9,072-kilogram) class.

Certified in January 2014, the first H175 deliveries didn’t take place until December that year, to Belgian operator NHV. Anthony Pecchi Photo

Having had the privilege of flying both the H175 and the AW189, as well as taking multiple turns in the 525 simulator in Bell’s systems integration lab, I can objectively say that all three helicopters are fine examples of multi-mission, get-the-job-done medium machines. But with the current dip in oil-and-gas prospects, how are they faring? And where are they in their respective evolutionary paths?

First to market

Let’s begin with the AW189, which was the first of the three aircraft to market. Beginning commercial operations with Bristow over the North Sea in July 2014, the 18,258-pound (8,282-kilogram) maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) helicopter is the big daddy of the helicopters in the AgustaWestland “family” concept, which also includes the time-proven AW139, and the new light-intermediate twin, the AW169.

In March 2015, soon after Vertical flew the AW189, it attained Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, thus allowing deliveries to begin to U.S. customers. Era will be the first customer in the U.S. to operate the AW189 — and the first to fly it in the Gulf of Mexico — with plans for two of the type to enter into service by December 2015.

The aircraft received a significant advance in September, when its limited ice protection system (LIPS) gained certification — the first for a helicopter in its weight category. The LIPS system will allow the AW189 to further enhance its all-weather capabilities by permitting flights within known and defined envelopes of icing conditions. However, the option to descend into a known band of positive temperatures must be possible throughout the intended route. This is typical of conditions encountered, for example, over the North Sea. Icing trials are continuing in Alaska, as AgustaWestland moves closer to certification of a full ice protection system for the AW189.

With nearly 20 AW189s operating around the world, including in the unique climates and environments of the North Sea, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, the fleet has had palpable success in its initial entry into service. Bel Air Aviation, an offshore operator based in Denmark, is the AW189 fleet leader, having recently reached the 2,000-hour mark with its two aircraft. A third will soon be delivered. The global AW189 fleet is now nearing 7,000 hours.

Although clearly aimed at the oil-and-gas market, AgustaWestland reported that its first VIP AW189 is nearing delivery. And, with over 150 helicopters now sold (including firm orders, options, and framework contracts), the longevity of the AW189 appears quite secure.

AgustaWestland designed the cockpit of the AW189 to share operational similarities with its “sister” aircraft, the AW139 and AW169, enabling quicker and easier training for pilots converting between types.

As the fleet has expanded, the manufacturer has focused on bringing support, training, and logistics solutions closer to its customers’ operations. For example, to support the growing fleet in Northern Europe and the North Sea (including the 11 AW189s that are due to enter service as part of Bristow’s delivery of the U.K.’s search-and-rescue capability), AgustaWestland opened a regional supply center in Aberdeen. This facility currently has more than 2,000 parts in stock, with expansion to 6,000 planned by the time you are reading this.

The cabin of the AW189 can be configured to carry up to 19 passengers.





An AW189 Level D full flight simulator (FFS) is also located in Aberdeen (AgustaWestland expected it to be in service by the time Vertical went to press). The manufacturer has another AW189 flight training device and one FFS operational in Sesto Calende, Italy. One FFS has been ordered by Gulf Helicopters, and another is under evaluation at AgustaWestland Malaysia.

Focus on the H175

Next we have the Airbus Helicopters H175. I first flew this aircraft in March 2013, while it was still in the process of receiving FAA certification. However, it wasn’t until December 2014 that the first two 16,534-pound (7,500-kilogram) MTOW aircraft were delivered to Belgian operator NHV. The aircraft entered into service in the North Sea just one week after delivery. NHV recently received a third H175, and will be accepting five more before the end of 2015.

Russian oil-and-gas operator UTair also received an H175 in December 2014. After delivery, the aircraft was placed on long term lease with Airbus Helicopters for marketing and training purposes. This helicopter was exhibited at Heli-Expo in March 2015, before initiating a three-month demonstration tour through Mexico, the U.S., and Brazil.

Bell released this image to show how a VIP 525 cabin could look. Larry Thimmesch, VP of commercial programs at Bell, said his biggest surprise with the program so far is the amount of interest from the corporate/VIP sector.

As of August 2015, the two H175s in service with NHV had accumulated more than 1,000 flight hours and completed more than 750 flights, with an average cabin occupancy of approximately 11 passengers. A number of these missions were conducted in challenging North Sea weather conditions, with loaded non-stop flights performed to distances of 175 nautical miles.

“We are very pleased with the H175s,” said Eric Van Hal, the CEO of NHV Group. “Our pilots appreciate their excellent handling characteristics, plus the speed and range; while passengers are impressed with the cabin comfort, smooth ride and low noise levels.”

Airbus Helicopters enjoyed a productive Heli-Expo 2015 with the H175, with Bristow signing for 17 of the aircraft, Milestone Aviation Group signing for 28, and Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service (GFS) ordering seven. This took the H175 order book (including firm and options) to a total of 101 aircraft. The H175 has just received certification from the Mexican aviation regulation authority, DGAC, paving the way for deliveries to the first Latin-American customer — Mexican oil-and-gas operator Transportes Aéreos Pegaso — early next year.

Now that the oil-and-gas configuration is firmly in service, Airbus is enlarging the H175 mission capacity with two additional configurations. First is the VIP version, which will be certified next year, with deliveries to the first two customers also to take place in 2016.

Next is the public services version, with first deliveries to the version’s launch customer, GFS, to begin in the fourth quarter of 2017. The public services configuration is to offer multi-role capabilities, including search-and-rescue operations, emergency medical services, firefighting, law enforcement and land/maritime border security patrols.

Also in the works is the certification of an extended MTOW — to 17,196 pounds (7,800 kilograms) — that will offer customers an extra 300 kilograms of payload. Flight tests are in progress and the certification should come next year, along with the certification of an 18-passenger cabin, also planned for 2016. As of November 2015, four H175s were in service around the world.





Putting the 525 to the test

Last, but certainly not least, is the Bell 525 Relentless. This brand new “clean sheet” design was first announced at Heli-Expo 2012 and will be the first commercial fly-by-wire helicopter. The heaviest of the group with a maximum gross weight of 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms), the 525 will be a Category A helicopter at MTOW.

At press time, aircraft No. 1 had accumulated 50 hours of ground time and over 40 hours of flight time. So far, the helicopter has proven to be very stable with no surprises. “It flies very close to the analytical predictions,” Larry Thimmesch, VP of commercial programs at Bell, told Vertical.

One surprise that was reported was that the five-blade rotor hub (a first for Bell) needed no adjustments from the factory settings — no tracking and balancing or readjustment was required to fly it. The demonstrated stability of the rotor system was a nice surprise given that it was one of Bell’s biggest risks in the design.

There are nearly 20 AW189s now operating around the world. They have accumulated about 7,000 flight hours between them. AgustaWestland Photo

The aircraft’s fly-by-wire control laws have worked out so well that Bell is now playing with the physical aspects of the helicopter. This is part of the discovery process and includes tasks such as making changes to the horizontal stabilizer — removing it, changing its length and mass — to tweak the design. Following this process, the fly-by-wire specs will be locked down along with some minor tweaking and fine-tuning of the control laws.

The flight test aircraft is now in envelope expansion and has validated the 525’s predicted air speed capability of 165 knots true airspeed at 8,000 and 12,000 feet. The test pilots are expanding all corners of the envelope.

Bell also reported that the Garmin G5000H system has been working well, with only minor software tweaks required. Clearly, this is an advantage realized by both the avionics integration in the systems integration lab, as well as information provided through fellow Textron company Cessna’s experience with its Citation. My “flights” in the 525 sim revealed an incredibly user-friendly impression of the G5000H.

Belgian operator NHV clocked 1,000 flight hours in just the first eight months of operation with its two H175s.Airbus Helicopters Photo

The aircraft weights have been coming in at about two to three percent lighter than expected. Accordingly, Bell is anticipating an 8,200-pound (3,719-kilogram) useful load for the 525. The kit weights have also been coming in close to their design weights.

Aircraft No. 2 should be ready to fly by the time you are reading this, with ship 3 to closely follow. Ships 1 and 2 will be busy with envelope expansion until Heli-Expo 2016. Ship 3 will begin certification testing by April 2016.

Certification is expected to occur by the second quarter of 2017 — but Bell is already beginning work on the first customer aircraft. “The early aircraft will take time,” stated Thimmesch. “We will be installing kits as the aircraft are built, and we want to have them ready to go at the time of certification.”

While the 525 is clearly focused on the oil-and-gas market, Thimmesch reported that his biggest surprise thus far is how much interest the 525 has garnered from the corporate/VIP sector. “We’ve had to make adjustments on the kit side of the project to accommodate this more even distribution of orders between oil-and-gas and corporate/VIP,” he said.

This new medium twin segment is highly competitive. The H175, AW189, and Bell 525 are similar enough in their mission capabilities, yet different enough to fit a range of customer-specific niches and budgets. And with the three manufacturers all going after the traditionally order-rich oil-and-gas market segment with these aircraft, one can be sure they will all be putting their best foot forward to grab their fair share of the pie."

Airbus Counter-UAV System detects illicit drones and shuts them down - New Atlas,"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1jb3VudGVyLXVhdi1zeXN0ZW0vNDEyNjgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a projected one million drones sold during the holidays, the potential security risks to everything from military installations to energy plants to airports increased as well. Bearing that in mind, Airbus Defence and Space recently introduced its Counter-UAV System as a way to detect potential UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) threats from a distance of between 5 and 10 km (3 and 6 miles) and bring them down with electronic countermeasures.

The system uses a combination of radars, infrared cameras and direction finders to identify drones and determine their threat potential. A human operator compares the data from the system to a threat library and realtime analysis of control signals, to determine whether or not to jam the signal and interrupt the link between the drone and its pilot and/or its navigation system. A direction finder within the system can then be used to detect the location of the pilot for apprehension.

The company's Smart Responsive Jamming Technology ensures that only the signals used to operate the drone are jammed while other nearby frequencies remain unaffected and operational. The jamming technology is also designed to allow the user to both identify the UAV and initiate a controlled takeover if necessary.

Depending on the required configuration, the company said an operational system could be available by the middle of this year.

The Airbus Defence and Space Counter-UAV System joins a growing number of anti-drone systems that includes Battelle's DroneDefender and the Anti-UAV Defence System (AUDS) from Blighter Surveillance Systems.

Ural Works of Civil Aviation (UWCA) has signed an agreement with Airbus Helicopters to allow the licensed production of H135s at its facility in Yekaterinburg, Russia.

The contract also involves the production of the Turbomeca Arrius B2B Plus engines for the H135, in cooperation with the engine manufacturer, as well as the technical repair of powertrains.

According to Airbus Helicopters, the agreement with Ural Works is aimed at supporting the development of the air medical fleet in Russia.

“The end objective is to provide Russian civil authorities with the most modern and reliable helicopters available on the market for medical transportation and public services missions, assembled locally and cost-effectively,” the company said in a statement.

According to Vadim Badejo, general director of UWCA, the volume of investments in the project at the initial stage will exceed US$10 million , with a possibility of a significant increase during the next few years.

The initial volume of production is expected to reach 20 to 30 units — which will be comparable to the volume of Bell 407GXPs produced by the plant thanks to the recently-announced contract UWCA signed with Bell Helicopter.

So far, only 11 Airbus H135 helicopters have been in commercial service in Russia, but the localization of their production will allow Airbus to significantly increase the volume of their supply to the Russian market during the next few years.

The H135 is a multipurpose light twin-engine helicopter designed for seven passengers, with a payload of 1.5 tonnes."

PICTURES: Airbus to flight test new C295 aerial refuelling rig - Flightglobal,"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vcGljdHVyZXMtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0LW5ldy1jMjk1LWFlcmlhbC1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLXJpZy0vMTE5MzQ1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space's development of an air-to-air refuelling system for the C295 is moving ahead, with a “dry contact” flight test planned in 2016, ahead of a full fuel transfer trial.

The company’s A400M military turboprop is late in receiving an air-to-air refuelling capability, causing frustration among customers, with France now turning to the Lockheed Martin KC-130J for support.

Now, Airbus wants to outfit the stout C295 with a centreline, cabin-mounted hose-and-drogue rig for in-flight refuelling of combat helicopters. The device would be a new capability option for current and prospective C295 operators.

“We have already performed the hose control test in the rig and we are currently preparing the hose control test for in-flight [testing],” a spokesman tells Flightglobal. “We aim to perform the dry contact flight-test with a C295W test aircraft during 2016 and then to perform the fuel transfer flight test.”

Airbus Defence & Space

If successful, the spokesman says the technology would become available “during 2017”. Airbus is already in talks with potential buyers.

The company also confirms it is pressing forward with “XTOL” experiments, or extreme takeoff and vertical landing. That capability has been requested by certain unnamed customers, Airbus says.

“We are still in the technical analysis phase,” according to the spokesman. “The programme involves an aggressive optimisation of flap-utilisation in line with the approved operations for A400M. This will allow a significant reduction in ground runs, improving the tactical capabilities of the C295.”

Mexico was the launch customer of the C295W.

Airbus Defence & Space

C295W is the company’s latest variant, equipped with winglets for 4% better fuel efficiency as well as improved lift, range and performance in hot and high conditions. One example owned by the Mexican navy recently completed a tour of Latin America, where Airbus is campaigning the type, offering general troop transport, anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning and control configurations, as well as surveillance and electronic signals intelligence.

According to Airbus figures updated in December, the company has delivered 144 of 165 total C295 orders, with 142 aircraft currently in operation.

Airbus Introduces A System To Jam Drones Out Of The Sky - Popular Science,"Thu, 07 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXdhbnRzLXRvLWphbS1kcm9uZXMtb3V0LXNreS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For every cheap flying robot, there is an elaborate, expensive system to counter it. The latest anti-drone tool comes from European aerospace and defense giant Airbus, and promises a high-tech solution to small flying robots. They’re showing off the system at the Consumer Electronics Exposition in Las Vegas, though no word yet on if they’ve caused any nearby drones to crash.

From Airbus:

The Airbus system appears similar to one by Italy’s Selex ES, which also tracks drones and then seeks to jam them. For defense companies that already make tracking and jamming technology, bundling them together as an anti-drone tool seems a smart business move. It’s hardly the only way to stop drones, though.

Boeing and others are developing anti-drone lasers, to just destroy the flying machines. Bullets work too, if you’re a marine sniper with great aim or you have a bunch of machine guns and aren’t worried about where the bullets fall. The Battelle DroneDefender combines these approaches, as a rifle-attachment that guards can point at a drone to jam it and send it crashing down. Alternatively, guards could look to South Korea and Tokyo, where they’re testing or, in the latter case, deploying net-carrying drones to catch the tiny robots.

The low cost and flying ability of drones make them an attractive threat to design against, even if the real risks from drones are mostly hypothetical. So far, more planes have hit turtles than drones in the United States, and we haven’t seen an equal rise in anti-turtle countermeasures."

Airbus Helicopters sees 2015 orders and deliveries fall | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXNlZXMtMjAxNS1vcmRlcnMtYW5kLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZmFsbC8xMTk0MzkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters saw orders and deliveries slide last year as the rotorcraft market showed continued weakness in both the civil and military sectors.

Deliveries dropped by 16% to 395, from 471 in 2014, the latter a decline on the 497 recorded in 2013.

Gross orders fell 4% to 383 units from 402 the previous year, with 50 military cancellations – predominantly Tiger attack helicopters and NH90 transports for Germany – driving net order intake down to 333.

However the most alarming sales decline came in the heavy segment – comprising the H225 and its military derivative – where order intake plunged to just two units, from 32 the year before and 33 in 2013.

That fall is indicative of the state of the offshore transportation market where plummeting oil prices – down to $31 per barrel on January 25 – have caused a huge reverse in a previously booming market.

There was, however, better news for the super-medium H175, which gained 36 orders in 2015 – up from eight in 2014 – including its first for a search and rescue variant, with a seven-helicopter order from Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service.

Airbus Helicopters

Orders for other major programmes were broadly flat, with the other notable decline shown by the H155 family, which pulled in just 13 orders, falling from 28 in 2014. However that may just be a reversion to the long-term trend, given only 17 were sold in 2013.

The H155 gained a more secure long-term future in 2015 with the announcement it will form the basis of Korea Aerospace Industries' new light civil/light armed helicopter programme.

Airbus Helicopters says this will be an “evolution” of the H155, with “several hundred units” to be produced for commercial and military applications.

New developments were also launched in 2015: the heavy X6, which is in a concept study phase, and the H160 where two flight-test prototypes have now been produced. The second of these – the first to be fitted with the Turbomeca Arrano engine – is scheduled to fly “in the coming days” says the company.

Airbus Helicopters remains the leader in the civil and parapublic market, having gained one percentage point of market share to 45%, while its share of the military segment slipped two percentage points, to 9%.

Airbus to sell three A380 superjumbo jets to Japan's ANA Holdings - Nikkei - Yahoo Lifestyle UK,"Mon, 04 Jan 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3N0eWxlL2FpcmJ1cy1zZWxsLXRocmVlLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby0xNTI1MjA0ODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) has won a deal to sell three A380 superjumbo jets to Japan's biggest carrier ANA Holdings Inc in a deal valued at about 150 billion yen ($1.25 billion), the Nikkei reported.

The planes are to be introduced in fiscal 2018 in routes to Hawaii and elsewhere, the paper said.

Orders for Airbus A380s have dried up in recent years reflecting a fundamental shift in the industry towards smaller, twin-engine planes that cost less to fly than four-engine jumbos. Airbus's A380 typically carries 544 passengers, according to the company's web site.

In November, Boeing Co (BA.N) said it had booked two firm orders for its 747-8 jumbo jet, ending what was shaping up to be a second year without net new purchases of the iconic four-engine plane.

Airbus's efforts to sell the A380 suffered a setback in 2014 when it cancelled a $2 billion contract with Japanese discount carrier Skymark Airlines Inc (SKALF.PK) for six of the superjumbo passenger jets after the carrier struggled to raise cash to pay the instalments.

On Wednesday, Airbus said it has pushed back the delivery of its first A320neo aircraft to the start of 2016, missing a goal to hand over the revamped version of the jet to its initial customer by the end of 2015.
