GECAS' Milestone Aviation Group to Acquire 28 H175 Airbus Helicopters | GE News - General Electric,"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2dlY2FzLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1ncm91cC1hY3F1aXJlLTI4LWgxNzUtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Represents largest customer commitment for Airbus’ new super-medium-lift rotorcraft

Agreement marks new step in Airbus Helicopters-Milestone Aviation Group relationship

Le Bourget, France, 15 June, 2015 - Milestone Aviation Group, a GE Capital Aviation Services company and the global leader in helicopter leasing, and Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, announced today that Milestone has increased its combined orders and options to a total of 28 H175s, the largest order for Airbus’ new super-medium-lift twin-engine rotorcraft.

“We have full confidence in the Airbus Helicopters’ leadership team and are delighted to expand our relationship with the introduction of the H175 to our fleet,” said Richard Santulli, Milestone’s Chairman. “The H175 is well-aligned with our commitment to offering the most innovative product solutions for our customers.”

“Today’s H175 order is illustrative of the Milestone team’s sharp focus on long-term industry growth,” said Daniel Rosenthal, Milestone’s President. “We have been impressed by the H175’s successful introduction into service and felt it was the appropriate time to further our commitment to the aircraft.”

Airbus Helicopters’ H175 was designed to meet the most demanding oil and gas industry transportation requirements, offering new levels of comfort with the largest cabin in its class, as well as low in-flight vibration and noise levels. The rotorcraft provides highly cost-efficient service, with a capacity of up to 18 passengers, low fuel consumption and the range to reach a large percentage of the world’s offshore installations.

“This latest agreement builds on our outstanding relationship with Milestone, who owns one of the most valuable Airbus civilian helicopter fleets in operation and on order in the world,” said Guillaume Faury, the President & CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “It also reinforces the H175 as an aircraft of choice in the super-medium category.”

The H175 entered service last December and is demonstrating high availability in more than 900 flight hours performed by customers to date, while also confirming the rotorcraft’s designed-in maintainability - which is backed by Airbus Helicopters’ support and services. It is certified to the latest airworthiness standards, covering both the helicopter and the new Helionix® avionics suite - providing increased safety through reduced pilot workload, enhanced situational awareness, improved flight envelope protection and system redundancy.

Contributing to the H175’s competitive edge is its recommended cruise speed of 150 kts., while the maximum cruise speed exceeds 165 kts. - all achieved at extremely low vibration levels.

Excellent power performance for the H175 includes hover out of ground effect (HOGE) with a maximum 7.5-metric-ton take-off weight at 5,800 ft. at ISA+20°C conditions; one engine inoperative (OEI) hover performance, which ensures safety during hoisting for search and rescue missions; and extensive power reserve ensuring heli-deck performance (PC1) at maximum take-off weight in ISA+20°C conditions.

The helicopter’s radius-of-action in an oil and gas mission configuration enables 16 passengers to be transported to offshore rigs at distances of 140 nautical miles (NM.) on crew change flights, extending to nearly 200 NM. when 12 passengers are carried. Further certification of the H175 at an increased maximum take-off weight of 7,800 kg. will offer operators the ability to further expand the radius-of-action by 40 NM., or to carry 300 kg. of additional payload.

The H175 is a perfect complement to Airbus Helicopters’ heavy-lift H225 (formerly known as the EC225), which is deployed worldwide by oil and gas airlift service providers. As a tandem offered only by Airbus Helicopters, the H175 and H225 are able to support the oil and gas sector’s development in terms of both range and payload.

Flying a SATA Airbus A310 “Football” to the Azores - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 04 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi9mbHlpbmctc2F0YS1haXJidXMtYTMxMC1mb290YmFsbC1hem9yZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of a recent business trip, I had to make a trip to the Azores. There are a limited number of options for getting out to the island chain in the central Atlantic. As I was coming from Lisbon, I had the option of either taking the low-cost route of Ryanair/easyJet, or full-service options of TAP or SATA (Sociedade Açoriana de Transportes Areos).

What sealed the deal to take SATA over TAP was the fact that my desired flight was to be operated by an Airbus A310 aircraft, (affectionally known as “the football”), a classic airliner that is disappearing from active commercial service. I had never flown on an A310, nor on SATA, so I was looking forward to this trip.

Departure in Lisbon was from Terminal 1. Online check-in is possible with SATA, however as I had a bag to drop off and I wanted a “souvenir” paper boarding pass (something harder to come by these days), I used the classic counter check-in. As my flight was was continuing on to Boston, from Ponta Delgada, the departure was from the non-schengen area of the terminal. This necessitated passing through passport control, and was hassle-free as my boarding pass clearly stated I was disembarking in the Azores and I only needed my ID card.

When ready to board, we boarded a bus and headed out on the ramp. No complaints from me, since I enjoyed the experience of the A310 up-close-and-personal.

Once on-board it was like a blast from the past. The cabin had the typical older aircraft smell and the yellow lighting, as well as the old-style overhead monitors. Once seated, I was very surprised at how tight the legroom was. I guess the new slim-line seats in more modern aircraft make sense for an increase in legroom; but what the seat lacked in legroom it made up for in padding. That is something that is greatly lacking in the new slim-line generation of seats.

As these were really the older-generation seats, my legroom was further encroached upon when the person in from decided to deeply recline their seat; I would not want to be on this aircraft all the way to Boston!

In-flight service consisted of a sandwich as well as a bottle of juice. Standard non-alcoholic hot and cold beverages were on offer, as well as some local Azorean soft drinks. One of my favorite things to do when I am traveling on an new airline is to try the local beverages on offer. In this case, the local beverage offered was Kima – this is a soft drink made from passionfruit juice; I am a huge fan of passionfruit so I was very happy with this choice.

IFE on the two-hour over-water flight consisted of my iPhone. The overhead screens did run some loop video promoting tourism in the Azores but as there were no headphones provided it was not possible to listen in (I am not sure if the next flight to Boston has headphones or a greater selection of movies on offer).

The crew on the flight were very genuine and service-focused. I felt that they delivered the spirit of the Azores; in fact, everyone that I came across on this trip was very warm and welcoming toward foreigners — something that is at times hard to come by in Europe.

Disembarking in Ponta Delgada was again via stairs, but not before I got a chance to visit the flight deck of the lovely aircraft. It was nice to see an Airbus cockpit with the classic yoke in place of the side-stick, as well as numerous analog instruments.

Overall, SATA was on-par with other European airlines, albeit that the cabin of the aircraft was definitely showing its age. Despite the aging cabin, I was still happy to get to fly on one of the last few remaining classic Airbus A310s in passenger service today.

The A310’s service life in SATA is slowly coming to an end. In 2017, SATA will begin replacing the A310 with more modern A330 aircraft. Whilst this fleet upgrade will be welcomed for passengers and the airline alike, with increased capacity, fuel efficiency, and on-board comfort, it will be one less classic aircraft in the skies which AvGeeks will be able to enjoy.

Airbus to build 900 satellites for OneWeb internet-from-space project - The Guardian,"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlLzIwMTUvanVuLzE2L2FpcmJ1cy10by1idWlsZC05MDAtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1mb3Itb25ld2ViLWludGVybmV0LWZyb20tc3BhY2UtcHJvamVjdNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlLzIwMTUvanVuLzE2L2FpcmJ1cy10by1idWlsZC05MDAtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1mb3Itb25ld2ViLWludGVybmV0LWZyb20tc3BhY2UtcHJvamVjdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will design and build about 900 satellites for privately owned OneWeb, which plans to offer high-speed, space-based internet access to billions of people worldwide, company officials have announced.



About 700 of the satellites, each weighing less than 150 kg (330lb), would be launched into orbit beginning in 2018, with the rest staying on the ground until replacements were needed, said OneWeb, based in Britain’s Channel Islands.

Airbus said it would be a new approach to satellite production, with up to four being built per day.

Bankrolled in part by Richard Branson’s London-based Virgin Group and chipmaker Qualcomm, the project would cost between $1.5bn and $2bn, said OneWeb founder and chief executive Greg Wyler.

Airbus Defence and Space said it would build the first 10 satellites at its facility in Toulouse, France, before shifting production to the United States.

Several other companies were vying for the spacecraft contract including Thales Alenia Space, Space Systems/Loral, Lockheed Martin Corp’s Space Systems and OHB of Germany, the industry trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology reported.

Some of OneWeb’s satellites would be launched by Branson’s space company Virgin Galactic, which is developing a low-cost, small satellite launcher and trying to put a suborbital passenger spaceship into operation.

Wyler declined to disclose how much Virgin and Qualcomm were investing in the project. As part of the deal, unveiled in January, Branson and Qualcomm Executive chairman Paul Jacobs joined OneWeb’s board of directors.

Before starting OneWeb Wyler co-founded the satellite venture O3b Networks and briefly worked at Google on another project to beam internet access from space. Wyler left Google in 2014 to work on his own satellite project, named WorldVu, which later became OneWeb.

Google, along with Fidelity, has since made a $1bn investment in another internet-via-satellite project being developed by California-based SpaceX.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999986886978149}",neutral,0.9999986886978149,0
OneWeb selects Airbus to build 900 Internet satellites – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMTUvb25ld2ViLXNlbGVjdHMtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLTkwMC1pbnRlcm5ldC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defense and Space and OneWeb, a startup backed by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and wireless tech giant Qualcomm, announced Monday plans to set up a joint venture for the construction of 900 Internet broadcasting satellites for launches beginning in 2018.

OneWeb’s selection of Airbus comes after a competition among U.S. and European satellite manufacturers to win the lucrative deal to construct the largest fleet of spacecraft ever launched.

The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Airbus officials said it requires the company to scale up its satellite manufacturing business to complete construction of up to four spacecraft per day.

In a statement, Airbus and OneWeb officials said the European contractor’s experience with assembly line production of airliners will help establish the rapid cadence of satellite integration required to meet OneWeb’s ambitious launch schedule.

The companies announced the partnership in conjunction with the Paris Air Show.

“Combining the innovation and large volume manufacturing techniques from its A350 aircraft production, with a rich history of building extremely reliable high performance space systems, Team Airbus will help us deliver the OneWeb system on time, providing reliable connectivity for our customers,” said Brian Holz, head of space systems at OneWeb. “We look forward to working with Airbus Defense and Space in order to bring to bear the best resources around the globe for achieving affordable Internet access for everyone.”

Airbus Defense and Space’s core satellite business is in building large one-off communications and Earth imaging spacecraft spacecraft. The company has a base satellite platform, but each production unit is tailored to the needs of its customer.

That paradigm must change to meet OneWeb’s demanding schedule.

OneWeb officials said earlier this year the company would place launch contracts after selecting a satellite manufacturer. Launch providers from the United States and Europe, such as a new air-launched rocket under development by Branson’s Virgin Galactic, are thought to be in contention for OneWeb deals.

Each OneWeb satellite will weigh less than 150 kilograms (330 pounds) and will begin launching in 2018. The satellites will fly in orbits about 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) above Earth.

“This partnership is a fantastic new chapter in our space story,” said Francois Auque, head of space systems at Airbus Defense and Space. “Teaming with OneWeb with a requirement to produce several small satellites each day has inspired us to develop innovative designs and processes that will dramatically lower the cost in large volumes for high performance space applications.”

Airbus and OneWeb said the first 10 satellites will be produced at the Airbus plant in Toulouse, France. The remaining 890 satellites will be assembled at an undisclosed site in the United States.

“Without doubt, this program is challenging but we’re ready for it because we have leveraged resources and expertise across the entire Airbus Group,” Auque said in a statement. “The agility and flexibility of ‘Team Airbus’ enables us to continue to be a major player in the rapidly evolving global space market.”

OneWeb’s constellation will consist of 648 operational satellites. The rest of the spacecraft will be spares on the ground or in orbit.

“We have worked with Airbus Space and Defence, to streamline the manufacturing process to the point that several satellites can be produced each day,” Holz said. “This will redefine the cost structure for satellites, enabling rapid iteration and development of space related technologies.”

Established by telecom entrepreneur Greg Wyler and based in Britain’s Channel Islands, OneWeb plans to deploy the satellites into 20 orbital planes around Earth for global coverage. The satellite Internet signals will supply private consumers, businesses, schools, and hospitals with broadband connectivity through small ground user terminals, which can connect nearby phones, computers and other devices with the Internet, according to OneWeb.

The network will provide more than 10 terabits per second of new capacity to underserved areas around the world and extend the reach of mobile phone networks and Internet service providers, OneWeb officials said.

“Utilizing OneWeb’s priority access in the Ku-band for exactly the purpose intended, Airbus and all of OneWeb’s partners have an opportunity to make a long-term impact on access to communications for those on the other side of the digital divide,” Auque said.

Before splitting off to launch OneWeb, Wyler founded O3b Networks to beam backhaul broadband services to rural areas. O3b has 12 satellites in orbit today, and telecom companies from Pacific island nations and Africa are among O3b’s initial customers.

O3b is backed by Google, HSBC and satellite operator SES. Wyler joined Google from O3b, then left last year to work on OneWeb.

“The constellation is a communications system to bring Internet access to the world,” Wyler said in a promotional video posted on YouTube by Airbus. “The fundamental mission is to enable affordable access to the emerging markets. Just about half the world has limited to no communications at all. It’s a big project, but OneWeb is designed to bring Internet access right to the schools, and right to places in the most rural of environments, high-speed Internet access — 50 megabits per second at 30 milliseconds latency.”

OneWeb services should begin in 2019, officials said.

“So it’s identical to a cable modem without being constrained to having to live in the city,” Wyler said.

Google confirmed in February a $900 million investment in SpaceX to support innovation in space transportation, reusability and satellite manufacturing.

Armed with fresh Google funding, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk in January announced a plan to field a 4,000-satellite constellation in low Earth orbit for global Internet service, with initial operations expected within five years.

Musk said SpaceX will build its own satellites at a new manufacturing center in Redmond, Washington, keeping with the company’s penchant for in-house hardware production.

Large satellite fleets have met trouble in the past.

An 840-satellite constellation named Teledesic went bust in 2002 before its first launch, even with the backing of Bill Gates, cell phone tycoon Craig McCaw and Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

Iridium and Globalstar, which launched their mobile communications satellites, fell into financial ruin but emerged from bankruptcy. Both are still operating today.

Airbus wraps up Paris Air Show 2015 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi8xOC9haXJidXMtd3JhcHMtdXAtcGFyaXMtYWlyLXNob3ctMjAxNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 18, 2015, c. Leeham Co: Airbus traditionally wraps up the Paris Airshow with a Thursday review of their orders during the week. We have the major events captured in pictures, describing what was announced during the week. Boeing does not end the air show with a similar event.

Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice Brégier, opened the wrap up by saying that he was perhaps a little to conservative in the first briefing Monday where he said that he expected Airbus to book “a couple of hundred orders” during the show. In the end it became 421 orders/commitments, the fourth best result during air shows in Airbus history.

The picture shows the division of the orders between Airbus models.

Brégier used the continued high order rate for Airbus to underline that he did not believe the strong sales of airliners is because a bubble is pumped up. There is a solid market behind all these orders and it confirms the updated global market forecast that Airbus presented on the shows first day, said Brégier.

Demand for civil aircraft continues to be high and Airbus sees a market over the next 20 years of 33,000 aircraft. The majority of these will be single aisle which is also where the margin is going forward. The more profitable twin-aisle are simply outnumbered by single aisles.

The continued success for Airbus in single aisles has now convinced Airbus that it will increase their market share from 50:50 with Boeing for A320 vs. 737NG to 60:40 in Airbus’ favor for A320neo vs. 737 MAX.

This is a result of the strong A320 line, where especially the high-end A321neo is increasing sales. The show’s largest order for Airbus was from Wizz Air, which gave a commitment for 110 239 seat A321neo with a further 90 purchase rights.

This order also brought the backlog of A320neo orders over the 4,000 mark.

Other significant orders for A320 were from Korean Air, 30 A321neo.

Synergy’s leasing arm buying 62 A320neo. There were also other A320neo orders, one of 60 units from an undisclosed Asian customer. Airbus also announced that it has launched a freighter conversion program for older A320 with ST Aero.

Widebodies

Airbus has finally got the A330-300 regional version going. Saudi has ordered 20 together with 30 A320ceos.

Garuda also has signed an MOU to buy 30 A350-900s.

The only Airbus model which was not ordered during the show was A380. Airbus said that it has several campaigns on-going and Airbus COO Customers, John Leahy, was confident that he will sell more A380s during 2015.

OneWeb Taps Airbus To Build 900 Internet Smallsats - SpaceNews,"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtd2lucy1vbmV3ZWItY29udHJhY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was updated June 19

LE BOURGET, France — Start-up satellite Internet-delivery company OneWeb LLC on June 15 announced that Airbus Defence and Space of Europe would be prime contractor for OneWeb’s 648-satellite constellation of Internet delivery satellites.

The first of the satellites, each weighing about 150 kilograms, is scheduled for launch in 2018. OneWeb, based in Britain’s Channel Islands, must begin broadcasting in its selected Ku-band frequency by 2019 to maintain its regulatory status at the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that assigns orbital slots and broadcast frequencies.

Airbus and OneWeb said the arrangement – it is not yet a contract – calls for the two companies to select a satellite manufacturing facility on U.S. soil to build most of the 900-satellite order, which includes ground and in-orbit spares. The first 10 will be designed and built at Airbus’s Toulouse, France, facility.

Industry officials in the past month had said Airbus had made what for some was a surprisingly focused and aggressive effort to win the OneWeb business. Airbus officials had said their company’s background in building aircraft and helicopters gave it a built-in advantage over other prospective contractors insofar as Airbus is used to building high-tech systems in large series.

OneWeb Space Systems Director Brian Holz evoked Airbus’s heritage in aviation in a June 15 statement, saying:

“Combining innovation and large-volume manufacturing techniques from its A350 aircraft production, with a rich history of building extremely reliable high-performance space systems, Team Airbus will help us deliver the OneWeb system on time, providing reliable connectivity for our customers.”

Airbus Defence and Space said in a statement that the company would have no further comment about the OneWeb agreement, which apparently falls short of a contract, beyond what it said in its announcement of the deal.

In an interview, Holz said the OneWeb satellites would operate in near-polar orbit at around 1,200 kilometers in altitude, and that the final number of operational satellites likely would rise over time. The current design calls for 648 spacecraft plus spares.

Holz said OneWeb has designed the system to strictly follow orbital debris-mitigation guidelines for removing satellites from orbit and, for low-orbit satellites, assuring that they reenter the Earth’s atmosphere within 25 years of retirement.

“We intend to be a very good steward of space,” Holz said. “Deorbiting the satellites was a big driver in our design considerations. We do not intend to create a lot of junk.”

Airbus announced in early June that it had created a venture capital fund in Silicon Valley, with initial capital of $150 million, to invest in promising enterprises, but it was unclear whether this fund would be used to finance the satellite plant.

OneWeb has not disclosed how much money it has raised or the identity of its investors beyond Virgin Group Chief Executive Richard Branson and computer-chip manufacturer Qualcomm, with the latter likely involved in the design of OneWeb’s user terminal modems.

OneWeb has said that, once the production facility hits its full run rate, each satellite will be produced for around $500,000.

OneWeb presumably will seek export credit agency financing and in principle would be able to solicit help from both the U.S. Export-Import Bank and its French equivalent, Coface.

But both agencies require a certain amount of work to be done in their nations before giving aid to a project. With only 10 satellites built in France, it is not certain that Coface would enter the OneWeb picture in any sizable way aside from a possible launch provided by the Arianespace consortium of Evry, France.



[spacenews-ad]

Is United About to Acquire 2 Airbus A380s? - View from the Wing,"Tue, 02 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9pcy11bml0ZWQtYWJvdXQtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS0yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday Jenn T. pointed me to an airliners.net thread suggesting that, supposedly, United management was confirming that they were in advanced talks with Airbus to acquire two A380s.

My first reaction was that this made no sense at all. The trend among US airlines has been capacity discipline. There’s no flight United operates with the demand for this large an aircraft. They’ve even down gauged their Sydney flights from 747s to 777s. If it made sense it would have to be on a route with more than one daily flight, where the flights would be combined meaning United would offer fewer frequencies.

No US airline has ordered an Airbus A380 to-date. While I love the plane from a passenger perspective, at least in premium cabins, the project hasn’t performed as well as expected and outside of Emirates hasn’t developed ongoing customers generating new interest and orders in some time.



Singapore A380 Suite



Qantas A380 First Class



Emirates A380 Shower Suite

Perhaps, though, poor sales of the A380 is exactly what could create a scenario where this is plausible. Shane M. points me to a Seeking Alpha piece on the rumor,

United is reportedly in intermediate stages of ordering the world’s largest passenger aircraft, the A380.

Supposedly they’re negotiating over 2 A380s that were originally destined for financially troubled Skymark Airlines of Japan which cancelled its orders last year.

If Airbus has a customer dropping out of the planes, and hasn’t been able to secure new orders, they’d be willing to sell these very cheap. And to get into the U.S. market, to finally place their first A380 with a US carrier, they’d be willing to take a real loss as well. The plane has been operational long enough that – pure speculation here – they no longer have agreements in place to reimburse existing A380 operators if they sell a plane for less than the price charged to that operator.

United would certainly operate the planes in an economy, economy plus, and business class configuration with no first class if this materialized. This wouldn’t be an over-the-top configuration with bar and lounge area, showers, and walled suites. It would be a high density plane meant for carrying a large number of passengers economically.

I remain skeptical, that much capacity only makes sense when reducing frequency which may not make sense from a revenue standpoint. This is only possible if the deal is so good that the planes are considered virtually free. And they may be — there’s talk of United receiving the planes “on a trial basis.”

Rumors are that the aircraft would be based in Houston or Washington Dulles. I doubt it — neither airport is capacity constrained. Replacing a 747 out of San Francisco perhaps plausible.

Very much a rumor, that may never come to fruition, but one being much-discussed and that provides some interesting hypotheticals!","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.4999884366989136}",negative,0.4999884366989136,-1

What’s in the works, Airbus’ ‘Future Factory,’ parallels what’s going on at Boeing’s plants in the U.S.

For years, the balance of power between these two global aerospace giants has been determined by their sales success. But over the next few years, with both their order books full to bursting, they’ll go toe-to-toe in a massive industrial acceleration, each aiming to out-build the other.

The winner will be whichever one best controls the dramatic spike in jet production.

Williams wants to fix unsafe working conditions, inconsistent quality, lost productivity.

Boeing’s shining example of manufacturing transformation is the Renton 737 jet assembly plant, where it has recently added further automation with a new fuselage systems installation line and new wing panel fastening machines. Everett is also changing, as engineers rearrange 787 Dreamliner final assembly to increase the rate and introduce robots to assemble 777 fuselages.

Scott Fancher, Boeing vice president of product development, who is responsible for all the new jet programs, said Boeing is “on the leading edge of automation.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.989052951335907}",positive,0.989052951335907,1
Airbus confirms software configuration error caused plane crash - Ars Technica,"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAxNS8wNi9haXJidXMtY29uZmlybXMtc29mdHdhcmUtY29uZmlndXJhdGlvbi1lcnJvci1jYXVzZWQtcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An executive of Airbus Group has confirmed that the crash of an Airbus A400M military transport was caused by a faulty software configuration. Marwan Lahoud, chief marketing and strategy officer for Airbus, told the German newspaper Handelsblatt on Friday that there was a ""quality issue in the final assembly"" of the components of the aircraft engine.

As Ars reported on May 19, Airbus had issued a warning to its military customers about a potential software problem in the engine control software for the A400M. The release of the exact cause of the crash, however, had been delayed because a Spanish magistrate placed the flight data recorders from the aircraft under seal. Airbus has since been able to obtain the flight data, which Lahoud said confirms that the engine control software had been improperly configured during the installation of the engines on the ill-fated aircraft.

""The black boxes attest to that,"" Lahoud told Handelsblatt. ""There are no structural defects, but we have a serious quality problem in the final assembly."" The error was not in the code itself, but in configuration settings programmed into the electronic control unit (ECU) of the engines.

If it holds up, the finding means that Airbus will be able to avoid a complete redesign of the A400M's engines—the largest turboprop engines ever manufactured in Europe. The Spanish aircraft was being used by the military there to conduct pre-acceptance testing on the aircraft, which has already suffered from numerous delays and cost overruns.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9996242523193359}",negative,0.9996242523193359,-1

In fact, the two plane makers are expecting to book sales of as much as $23 billion just in narrow-body A320 and 737 airliners alone, Bloomberg reported.

But as impressive as these figures may be, sales are not expected to surpass that of the black Friday free-for-all of the last Paris Air Show.

In 2013, airlines and leasing companies ordered more than $170 billion in new airplanes over the week-long show. It took just three days for the tally to roll past the $100 billion mark.

According to Reuters, Boeing and Airbus — alone — sold a mind-blowing 908 aircraft that week with a combined sticker value of $135 billion.

That's billion with a ""b.""

Sure, airlines often negotiate extensive discounts off the sticker price. But still, even at half price, that's an impressive take.

Much of 2013's monstrous sales were as a result of massive of orders for Airbus' next generation A320neo and A350XWB jets along with Boeing's new 737max and 787 Dreamliners — pretty much the same planes being sold at the 2015 show.

So why have sales slowed?

The biggest difference between now and then is that companies like Airbus and Boeing have built up an enormous backlog of orders.

""Airplane makers have been selling twice as many planes as they can build,"" Deloitte vice chairman and head of US Aerospace & Defense Tom Captain told Business Insider in an interview.

According to Captain, airplane manufacturers have a record 2888 planes on order with a production backlog of 9 years. That means airlines and leasing companies won't be able to take delivery of some of their ordered aircraft for nearly a decade.

This delay may be dissuading some buyers from making purchases until these backlogs start to clear up.

Last year, Delta Airlines placed a $14 billion order for 50 Airbus widebody jets. According to Reuters, one reason the Atlanta-based carrier decided against the Boeing Dreamliner is due to the lack of production slots available for the hot selling jet.

And Airbus's ability to deliver the planes in a shorter time frame seemed to have tipped the balance towards the European plane maker.

However, airplane manufacturers are working to reverse this trend by ramping up the rate of production. According to Captain, plane makers increased the rate of deliveries 18% between 2011-2014.

Airbus has opened new production facilities in China and in Mobile, Alabama. While Boeing has established a new assembly plant in South Carolina for its Dreamliner.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9643423557281494}",neutral,0.9643423557281494,0
Airbus expects 11-abreast A380 to attract new breed of customer - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWV4cGVjdHMtMTEtYWJyZWFzdC1hMzgwLXRvLWF0dHJhY3QtbmV3LWJyZWVkLW9mLWN1c3RvbWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you think social media’s negative response to the recently unveiled 11-abreast seating option for the Airbus A380 has sent the European airframer and its cabin interiors partners back to the drawing board, think again. Airbus and A380 lessor Amadeo tell RGN they are very satisfied with the 3-5-3 economy class cabin design, which they say will meet the needs of a new breed of customer.

“Many airlines see [the current 10-abreast A380] as their flagship aircraft. If there is a choice between the A380 and the 777 … people who are familiar with the types of comfort you get on airplanes will chase the A380,” says Dr. Kiran Rao, executive vice president, strategy and marketing at Airbus.

As such, the 10-abreast A380 with 19-inch wide seats for long-haul flights will remain the standard. “Are the airlines that currently operate the aircraft going to rip out the seats and offer 11-abreast? Probably not,” says Rao, stressing that “you don’t need 11-abreast to make the aircraft economics work” on the A380.

Amadeo, which pushed Airbus on the new design, agrees that the 3-5-3 configuration isn’t targeted at carriers who use the A380 as their flagship. Operators such as Emirates, whose A380 economy class product “is like Premium Economy” don’t need to go 11-abreast, Amadeo CEO Mark Lapidus told RGN during a recent interview at the CAPA Aviation summit in Las Vegas.

But while the first wave of A380 customers will likely retain their 10-abreast economy cabins, “we’ve now entered another wave and are in discussion with airlines” that operate a different type of service in a different environment, says Airbus’ Rao.

“A380s don’t have to always fly on long-haul missions,” he says, noting that a lot of routes in Asian regional markets – think 6-8 hour flights from parts of Southeast Asia to India or Japan – are served by A330s and 777s (AirAsia X, for instance, flies super snug 9-abreast A330s), “and a lot of those routes would support the 11-abreast A380”.

The carriers suited to 11-abreast represent “a few airlines” and “are not brand new operators”, he says.

Though Airbus originally suggested it would raise the floor of the A380 to achieve the 3-5-3 layout, the airframer opted not to pursue this course of action. Instead, the design unveiled at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg “is an easy solution to get more capacity in that doesn’t require lots of work”, says Lapidus. And it retains an 18-inch comfort standard for seat width.

As RGN contributing editor John Walton reported from AIX, Airbus achieved its record density “by cutting seat width by between 1 and 0.5 inches, slashing armrest widths by just over 2cm (nearly an inch), angling window armrests outwards, trimming aisles and — in perhaps the worst case of foot space restriction for window passengers since Bombardier’s Q400 turboprop — jamming window seats up against the wall so far that they overhang six inches above the start of the curved sidewall.”

But Airbus and Amadeo sees the new design as an efficient use of space. “On the A380 main deck, the sidewalls move away from you so [we’re] utilizing that space; we still maintain the 18-inch width,” says Rao. “It delivers not just the A380 comfort but another standard of economics … another level of efficiency.”

Amadeo’s Lapidus is equally pleased with the new design. “I think it is great. They’ve finally woken up to the fact that the A380 needs to be seen by people not as some kind of strange thing which … they marketed in the past and what airlines talked about in the past – shower rooms, casinos and swimming pools,” he says, adding, “It may be a niche workhorse … but it is a workhorse that would enable hub-to-hub connectivity at lowest unit cost, and 11-abreast is something they should have done a long time ago.”

With specific regard to the window seat, Lapidus insists, “I’ve sat in that seat and think it’s pretty comfortable.” He doesn’t believe the photos shown on RGN do the seat justice. Moreover, he says it is “hilarious” for his golfing buddy, Boeing VP of marketing Randy Tinseth to be complaining in his blog about the window seat “given that Boeing puts out 787s at 9-abreast with seats that are about 16.9 inches…”

At the end of the day, says Airbus’ Rao, offering the option of 10- or 11-abreast configurations on the A380 is all about giving airlines choice. “With Boeing, if you want comfort, you don’t get [the] economics; if you want the economics, you don’t get comfort.”

The 9-abreast Boeing 787, for example, “is a very uncomfortable tube” in economy, he says. “They should rename the Dreamliner the Nightmareliner.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999070167541504}",neutral,0.9999070167541504,0

The 19-passenger, 10-ton-plus helicopter will go through a ""concept phase"" over the next two years before full development starts, Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said at a presentation of the new helicopter at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday.

The helicopter will be initially conceived for oil and gas customers, and will feature fly-by wire controls, a first for a civil helicopter produced by the firm, Faury said.

""The X6 will start as a civil helicopter because it is more reliable for numbers, while the military systems will take longer to develop and we need a customer,"" he said.

The firm would be keeping its NH90 and H225 on the market for the next 15 years, with the aim of bringing the X6 on the market after that, he said.

Airbus's X3 prototype had yielded valuable research on rotors, which would allow noise to be reduced and efficiency to be increased, while fly-by wire technology would be transferred from the NH90 and Airbus aircraft, Faury said.

As Airbus Helicopters increases ties with Polish industry, Polish engineers would work on the new program, he said.

Faury said that the firm's new H160 twin-engine medium helicopter had made its first flight Saturday. A mock up is on display at the Paris Air Show.

The H160 will be launched for civilian applications, but also could be a candidate for the French military's requirement for a light helicopter to replace a range of platforms for the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The Airbus H145, which has now been ordered by German Special Forces and the Thai Navy, had now received European civil certification, he said.

""The German MoD has agreed to the obtaining of civil certification, which will form part of the military certification,"" he said.

Asked about the spinning off of Sikorsky by UTC and its possible sale, Faury called it ""an important evolution"" in the industry, adding: ""We are keeping an eye.""

"Meet Adeline, Airbus' Answer To SpaceX Reusability - SpaceNews","Fri, 05 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9tZWV0LWFkZWxpbmUtYWlyYnVzLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLXJldXNhYmxlLXNwYWNleC1yb2NrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LES MUREAUX, France – Airbus Defence and Space on June 5 unveiled the product of what it said was a five-year effort to design a reusable Ariane rocket first-stage engine and avionics package, a project company official said was stimulated by SpaceX’s work on reusable rockets.

Airbus officials said they believe they have resolved some of the issues inherent in Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX’s reusability effort, notably the exposure of the first stage engine to high-speed stresses as it descends through the atmosphere to its landing zone.

Airbus’s Adeline — short for Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy — also imposes a much smaller performance penalty on its rocket than is the case for SpaceX’s reusable Falcon 9 first stage, all the while reusing 80 percent of the stage’s economic value — the engine, avionics and propulsion bay.

Addressing a press briefing at the Airbus facility here, company officials said they had worked for five years, outside the Airbus campus, in secrecy to secure the patents needed for Adeline. Part of the work was done with sister company Airbus Military Aircraft, whose work on unmanned aircraft and other atmospheric vehicles was used in Adeline’s iterations.

Airbus has openly said in recent months that it is seeking inspiration from Silicon Valley, with company Chief Executive Tom Enders leading the management team for a tour of the region earlier this year.

More recently, Airbus created a $150 million venture capital fund, based in Silicon Valley, to develop a range of technologies.

Adeline draws on the same inspiration. Benoit Isaac, Adeline project manager, said the small project team has been working out of a garage developing scale models of the Adeline vehicle — with two winglets and two rotary motors to guide the engine composite back to Earth for a horizontal landing on an airstrip — with a start-up mentality.

One company official said Enders had recently complained that SpaceX and its founder, Elon Musk, was generating favorable coverage worldwide for the Falcon 9 reusability work, whereas Airbus appeared to be standing still.

“This is our way of showing that it’s not just America that knows how to innovate,” Isaac said. “We can innovate here in Europe as well and we want our 140,000 colleagues in the rest of Airbus to know about it.”

Francois Auque, head of Airbus Defense and Space’s Space Systems division, cautioned that the company’s sole priority now was building the new-generation Ariane 6 rocket, an expendable vehicle scheduled to make its first launch in 2020. “Ariane 6 is our absolute top priority,” Auque said. “Adeline comes afterwards.”

Ariane 6, financed by European Space Agency governments, is a direct European response to the SpaceX commercial challenge on launch pricing.

The French space agency, CNES, has been looking at rocket reusability for many years, for the same reason as SpaceX: its promise of further cutting launch costs by recovering, refurbishing and reusing, multiple times, the high-cost elements of a rocket stage.

Like SpaceX, Airbus concluded that a recoverable upper stage posed too many challenges given the distance the stage would have to travel to get back to the launch base.

The focus then was on the first stage. SpaceX has begun efforts to return the entire first stage to an offshore barge, and ultimately to a point on land near the launch base.

Herve Gilibert, technical director for Airbus’ Space Systems division, said the Adeline propulsion unit — engine and avionics — is where lies most of the value of the first stage. The Airbus team concluded that SpaceX’s design of returning the full stage to Earth could be simplified by separating the propulsion bay from the rest of the stage, protecting the motor on reentry and, using the winglets and turbofans, return horizontally to a conventional air strip.

“We are using an aerodynamic shield so that the motor is not subjected to such high stress on reentry,” Gilibert said. “We need very little fuel for the turbofans and the performance penalty we pay for the Ariane 6 launcher is far less than the 30 percent or more performance penalty that SpaceX pays for the reusable Falcon 9 first stage.

SpaceX has not attempted to return a Falcon 9 first stage during the rocket’s missions to geostationary transfer orbit because these missions take all the energy available to the current Falcon 9. The company is introducing an improved-performance version of the vehicle’s Merlin engine this year that will allow the inclusion of landing gear and first-stage recovery even for geostationary orbit missions.

Estimates vary of how much fuel SpaceX needs to add to the first stage to effectuate a return to the spaceport. Airbus officials said they estimate it’s at least 35,000 kilograms.

For Adeline, they said, the Ariane 6 would need to add up to 2,000 kilograms of fuel to launch a geostationary-orbit satellite and perform the propulsion bay’s return to Earth.

Company officials said it is too soon to pin down how much a reusable first stage propulsion system would save in recurring launch costs, but that for now they assume between 20 and 30 percent.

Airbus said it timed the Adeline announcement to make an impact on the eve of the Paris Air Show, which begins June 15. The company made a similar splash in June 2007, announcing a space plane to carry tourists to the edge of the atmosphere.

A scale model of that vehicle has been tested and now is waiting for investors.

Adeline, like the space plane, has been financed so far by internal Airbus funds, with a total funding of no more than 5 million euros ($16.5 million). It will need substantial government support if it is to be available by 2025, as Airbus hopes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998863935470581}",neutral,0.9998863935470581,0

Airbus developments are helicopter highlight at 51st Paris Air Show - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRzYXJlaGVsaWNvcHRlcmhpZ2hsaWdodGF0NTFzdHBhcmlzYWlyc2hvdy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A full-scale mockup of an Airbus Helicopters H160 was on display at the manufacturer’s booth at the 51st Paris Air Show.

The main focus of the Paris Air Show may not be on rotary-wing aircraft, but the 51st edition of the biennial trade show still revealed some important helicopter developments at Le Bourget Airport.

Airbus Helicopters, Bell Helicopter, NHI and Turkish Aerospace Industries (THI) all brought helicopters to the show, as did the French military and the United States Army.

On the first day, United Technologies confirmed plans to spin off or sell Sikorsky Aircraft, which it has owned since 1929. The announcement created a lot of buzz in rotary-wing circles, but it will probably be a couple months before the outcome becomes clear.

Airbus had the biggest show announcements with the first flight of its recently unveiled 12-passenger H160 (completed two days prior to the air show), and the public launch of its new “X6” heavy helicopter.

The H160 was launched as a successor for the twin-engine Dauphin/EC155 family as the “X4,” and was revealed in the form of a full-scale mockup, along with its new name, at Heli-Expo 2015 in March.

The prototype commenced ground runs at Marseille’s Marignane Airport on May 27, and flew for the first time on June 13. The aircraft flew for about 40 minutes in ground effect, allowing the flight test team to check the overall behavior of the aircraft and verify measurements.

This was followed with a second flight on June 27, when it achieved speeds of 130 knots.

The main features of the H160 were defined during a concept phase between 2011 and 2013, prior to the launch of full-scale aircraft development.

Airbus’ X series also includes the X3 compound helicopter, and the X5, which became the H145 (EC145 T2), with a Fenestron tail rotor.

The X6 is an all-new design “that will set the standard for heavy helicopter segment,” said Guillaume Faury, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters, noting that a civil version will be developed prior to any military variant.

The X6 is targeted at the offshore oil-and-gas, search-and-rescue (SAR), and air transport markets, and will have better safety features, greater comfort, lower noise, lower vibration, longer range and better fuel efficiency than existing heavy models such as the H225.

The X6 will be the first Airbus civil helicopter to feature a fly-by-wire (FBW) control system. (Airbus jointly developed the multinational NH90, which was its first military helicopter with FBW controls.)

During the concept phase of X6 development — spanning the next two years — Airbus engineers will be working with a customer advisory team to define the right weight, configuration and suppliers for the new aircraft.

The efficiency of the rotor, transmission and drive train system are key considerations, as well as deciding which manufacturer will supply the X6’s large and fuel efficient engines.

Development of the X6 will utilize the technical resources of the entire helicopter group, including a growing technical team being established in Poland, where Airbus recently won a $3 billion order for 50 multipurpose H225M Caracal helicopters to replace Soviet-era military helicopters.

Airbus says the X6 will reach the market in the next decade and be produced alongside the H225 for several years.

Change in offshore demand

The collapse of world oil prices has reduced some offshore flying activity and has seen scheduled deliveries of some new helicopters delayed, with original equipment manufacturers reducing production rates to match demand.

However, Faury said the efficiency of the new Airbus H175 is being recognized by oil companies, and is the reason Bristow increased its H175 order to 17 aircraft at Heli Expo 2015 — and for Milestone Aviation Group increasing its orders and options to 28 aircraft at the Paris Air Show.

Three Airbus H175s are now in service with the Belgium offshore operator NHV Group operating from Den Helder, Netherlands, to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, with the aircraft flying 1,000 hours since mid-December.

Bristow is scheduled to receive its first H175 in the fourth quarter of 2015, and Airbus expects to have six to 10 H175s in offshore service by year-end. The company is also working on certification of the H175 in its search-and-rescue configuration.

During the air show, Airbus celebrated the 60th anniversary of Bristow Helicopters with a small reception hosted by Guillaume Faury with Jonathan Baliff, president and CEO of Bristow Group, and other executives as honored guests. Baliff said Bristow is focused on reducing the number of helicopter models it operates as one way of cutting costs and becoming more efficient.

Airbus also launched the H Pilot Club, which it said will create a dialog among the flight crews, mechanics and customers who own and operate its helicopters.

Despite the softening in oil-and-gas transportation demand, Faury reported that Airbus Helicopters recorded a 10 percent higher turnover and 20 percent more orders (by value) in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, and now has a €12.3 billion ($13.9 billion) sales backlog.

In the coming year, Airbus Helicopters will open a new management, rotor blade manufacturing, and support facility at Le Bourget Airport that will replace its La Courneuve facility near Paris.

In another development for the manufacturer, it is working with Korean Aerospace Industries on a long-standing joint venture to develop new military and civil helicopters in the five tonne class that will leverage H155 technology.

Outside the massive Airbus chalet, the European helicopter manufacturer displayed an H225M for the Brazilian Navy, an EC135T2 from the French Gendarmerie (police) heliport outside Paris, and a H145M mockup with weapons systems.

Other developments

Bell Helicopter displayed a single-engine 407 and a twin-engine 429 on wheels on the Le Bourget ramp.

A small celebration took place in the Textron chalet celebrating Milestone Aviation Group’s intent to move forward with a letter of intent to acquire 20 Bell 525 Relentless helicopters.

As John Garrison, president and CEO of Bell Helicopter, and Daniel Rosenthal, president of Milestone, signed legal documents in Paris and celebrated with a glass of Champaign, back in Amarillo, Texas, the 525 is ground running in preparation for the first flight, which could occur before the end of June.

Turkish Aerospace Industries, Inc. (TAI) brought an example of the T-129 ATAK attack helicopter to the show which entered operational service on with the Turkish land forces along the country’s southern border with Iraq and Syria in 2014.

Based on the Agusta A129CBT Mangusta (Mongoose), the highly modified T-129 ATAK is optimized for “hot and high” missions and powered by two 1,360 shaft-horsepower (s.h.p.) LHTEC CTS 800-4A engines produced in a 50/50 partnership between Rolls-Royce and Honeywell.

Turkish industry makes most of the new avionics and weapons on the T-129 as well as the airframe and parts of the uprated drive train and new tail rotor.

Elsewhere at Le Bourget, NHI displayed a French Army Aviation (ALAT) NH90 TTH Caiman helicopter outside its chalet, and the NH90 flew at the air show every day.

NHI celebrated various customer milestones such as the French Army’s first operational deployment of the NH90 to Mali for tactical transport missions.

The NH90 is produced in two versions: the NH90NFH (NATO frigate helicopter) for naval operations and the tactical transport variant for land-based operations. A total of 240 NH90s have been delivered to Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Greece, Oman, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand.

The U.S. military display included a U.S. Army Boeing CH-47F Chinook and AH-64D Apache, Sikorsky UH-60A Black Hawk and Airbus UH-72A Lakota, all flown in from bases in Germany.

The Swiss Air Force displayed an Airbus AS332M and the French military also displayed a French navy NH-90NFH an army Airbus EC665 Tigre HAD, as well as an H120 civilian-managed military trainer.

The southern portion of the air show grounds include more than half a dozen large exhibition halls where tens of thousands of trade visitors met everyday with customers and suppliers.

Russian Helicopters had a large booth, Enstrom a small booth in the U.S. pavilion, and Schiebel of Austria had its very successful Camcopter S-100 unmanned rotorcraft on display.

More than 200 Schiebel Camcopter S-100s are now in service, primarily with military and government customers, but Schiebel was actively marketing the S-100 for civil missions such as geophysical survey, power line patrol, and security operations.

A number of VIPs attending the show utilized chartered helicopters to commute to downtown Paris, with an AgustaWestland AW139 and French Dauphin among the helicopters seen overhead.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999028444290161}",neutral,0.9999028444290161,0
"United Airlines CFO: Airbus A380 Superjumbo ""doesn't work"" for us - Business Insider","Mon, 08 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNmby1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLWRvZXNudC13b3JrLWZvci11cy0yMDE1LTbSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1jZm8tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1kb2VzbnQtd29yay1mb3ItdXMtMjAxNS02P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Th Airbus A380 on its maiden flight.

As Airbus continues its search for new A380 customers, one carrier that won't be joining the select club of superjumbo owners is United Airlines.

In an interview with Flightglobal's Edward Russell, United Airlines CFO John Rainey said the mammoth Airbus jet ""doesn't work"" for the airline's network.

Instead of the A380, United has concentrated its resources on cheaper and smaller wide-body jets, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350XWB.

According to Rainey, the A380's higher trip costs make the plane less competitive against smaller rivals such as the Dreamliner.

This is despite the fact that the superjumbo returns similar per-seat costs as the smaller jets.

The A380 may offer great value to those who are looking to move huge numbers of people to and from their global hubs — carriers such as Emirates, Singapore, and Etihad.

But for United, the preference is to offer as many flights as possible throughout the day.

Instead of ""one flight a day and fill up an A380, we’d rather serve [a market] with a couple widebodies if the demand was there, because business passengers certainly like that,” Rainey told Flightglobal.

According to Rainey, high frequency is the name of the game for important moneymaking routes, such as New York to London.

Airbus is in middle of a sales push for the A380. The double-decker airliner is used by a dozen or so carriers around the world, but the manufacturer has struggled to find new customers willing to take on the aircraft.

Of the 317 A380s ever ordered, 140 have been ordered by Emirates.

And of the 154 aircraft that have been delivered, 58 have gone to the Dubai-based carrier.

In fact, Airbus hasn't sold an A380 to an airline in two years, and none of the 20 superjumbos ordered by leasing coming Amedeo in 2014 have found homes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999932050704956}",neutral,0.999932050704956,0

Company officials had earlier warned of a technical bug in the units which control the engines, which were believed to have been poorly installed during final assembly.

Investigators ""confirmed that engines one, two and three experienced power frozen after lift-off and did not respond to the crew's attempts to control the power setting in the normal way,"" the company said in a statement.

""Preliminary analyses have shown that all other aircraft systems performed normally and did not identify any other abnormalities throughout the flight.""

The A400M plane that crashed in a field and burst into flames just north of Seville's airport on May 9 was undergoing a test flight, before it was due to be delivered to Turkey in July.

Two of the six people on board the plane, a mechanic and an engineer, survived the crash and were rushed to hospital in critical condition.

The Spanish news website El Confidencial reported Tuesday that several safety protocols were allegedly ignored during the final assembly of plane, reportedly to make up for delays in delivery.

The computer system that controls the plane's engines, the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), ""should have been tested before, in a simulator, to check if everything worked,"" the website added.

The units which control the engines of the plane were poorly installed during final assembly, which could have led to the engines malfunctioning, Airbus group's chief of strategy Marwan Lahoud, earlier told the German daily Handelsblatt.

Less than three months after debuting a mockup of the H160 at Heli-Expo 2015, Airbus Helicopters has unveiled the first prototype of the aircraft.

The prototype was publicly revealed on Friday, May 29, in the presence of French Prime Minister Manuel Valls at Airbus Helicopters’ facilities in Marignane, France. According to Airbus, the unveiling followed the prototype’s initial ground run, which took place on Thursday, May 28. The company previously reported that the prototype, the first of three, powered on in November 2014.

The H160 — which was known by the code name “X4” prior to its Heli-Expo debut earlier this year — is a twin-engine, 5.5- to six-tonne aircraft that will occupy the space between the H145 and the H175 in Airbus Helicopters’ product range. It features a number of innovations, including a fully composite airframe, the company’s proprietary Blue Edge blades, electrical landing gear, and a new canted Fenestron tail rotor (read our full coverage on the H160 here ).

Airbus Unveils Partially Reusable Rocket Design 'Adeline' - Popular Science,"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtcGFydGlhbGx5LXJldXNhYmxlLXJvY2tldC1kZXNpZ24tYWRlbGluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The race is on to provide the first truly reusable rocket for travel to lower Earth orbit, and now Airbus has decided to enter the growing fray. The international aerospace company—known for manufacturing many of the commercial aircraft used for everyday flight—just revealed its secret rocket concept Adeline. Standing for ADvanced Expendable Launcher with INnovative engine Economy, it is marketed as a main competitor of SpaceX’s reusable Falcon 9 rocket. That is, once it becomes more than just a pretty video.

Like the Falcon 9, Adeline is only partially reusable—but the way it’s meant to work is quite creative. While most of the rocket’s fuselage goes unrecovered after launch, the bottom portion of the rocket housing the main engine (most expensive part and arguably the most important) is designed to safely return back home. The design calls for the first stage of the rocket to come equipped with wings and propellers, allowing it to travel back to Earth like a small plane and land gently on a runway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV29pEvZvZw?

The key difference between SpaceX’s first stage recovery concept and the one Airbus is pitching is fuel consumption. SpaceX is trying to save each Falcon 9’s main engines and fuel tank by autonomously landing much of the rocket’s fuselage on a drone ship in the middle of the ocean. (The company is getting pretty close to making that happen, too.) But to do this, SpaceX must load the rocket with extra propellant before liftoff; this leftover fuel then helps to guide the first stage back down to Earth gently during its descent.

Airbus says its design drastically cuts down on that extra fuel needed for landing. Adeline’s first stage is much smaller than SpaceX’s and detaches entirely from the rocket’s fuel tank. Instead of using fuel to guide itself back to Earth, the first stage will travel on a ballistic path using its tiny wings and propellers. It will then land horizontally on a runway just like an airplane. Airbus claims less propellant is needed for this technique, and therefore each launch will cost less.

And that’s what reusable rockets are all about, really—less cost. Currently, most, if not all, of a rocket is lost or unrecovered after it lifts off. This makes launching satellites and other payloads into space a costly endeavor, as an entirely new rocket and engine must be built for each subsequent launch. But many want to change this paradigm: By figuring out how to land the more expensive parts of rockets, they can then be reused for other launches, and thus, sending a tiny satellite into space won’t cost upwards of $50 million.

As of now, SpaceX is the major player in the reusable rocket arena, with Blue Origin also developing a reusable first-stage booster. The latter’s New Shepard spacecraft, which aims to take humans into suborbital space, had a successful test earlier this year. United Launch Alliance has its own crazy concept for recovering rocket engines called SMART, standing for Sensible, Modular, Autonomous Return Technology. With this technology, ULA plans to recover its rocket engines by having helicopters capture them in mid-air. At least Airbus’s concept doesn’t sound like the plot of a Michael Bay movie.

Of course, that all depends on when Airbus can get Adeline up and running. According to Ars Technica UK, Airbus has been working on this design concept in secret since 2010. Right now, it’s only in the prototype phase, and it won’t be ready for launch until at least 2025. It’s highly likely that SpaceX will have succeeded in landing and reusing its Falcon 9 rockets for many years by that point.

Here's Airbus's novel idea for driving down the cost of spaceflight - Vox.com,"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNS82LzkvODc1MjA5Ny9haXJidXMtcm9ja2V0LXJldXNhYmxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has famously likened our current model of spaceflight to throwing away a brand new 747 after a single flight to London. After each launch, the rockets used to put spacecraft in orbit are allowed to fall back to Earth and break into pieces — a decades-old practice that makes spaceflight really expensive.

This is why figuring out how to reuse a rocket is considered the holy grail of private spaceflight. Refurbishing a $100 million vehicle rather than throwing it away could dramatically reduce the cost of launches, and perhaps someday open up new possibilities in space tourism and exploration.

Airbus, an aerospace company that's launched about half of all large telecommunications satellites currently in orbit, just unveiled a pretty novel idea for making one key component reusable. Its Adeline rocket, currently in development, includes an engine that would detach and fly to Earth under its own power, then land on a runway like a plane:

Because the engine is the most expensive portion of the rocket, Airbus estimates this system could drive down the cost of each launch by 20 to 30 percent.

The company has been working on the technology since 2010, and last week it allowed reporters to see a few scaled-down demonstration models in its France manufacturing plant. However, it won't be ready any time before 2025, as the company focuses on developing the next generation of its Ariane rocket system first.

Other companies' plans include legs, parachutes, and helicopters

The other big private spaceflight companies have their own plans for reusable launch systems. SpaceX wants to land the entire first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket vertically after completing each launch, with thrusters slowing it down for a soft landing on a set of legs.

The company has tested this ambitious system several times on actual launches and come very close to succeeding — though it hasn't quite pulled it off yet:

Meanwhile, United Launch Alliance — a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that dominates military satellite launches — wants to reuse the engine of its next-generation Vulcan rocket using a parachute and helicopter:

It would theoretically do so by jettisoning the engine from the base of the rocket after launch, allowing it to fall back to Earth, and having a helicopter waiting to snatch it out of the air.

Of course, this would be a totally unprecedented feat and might not ever be possible. Right now, it's just a plan on paper.

Reusability could open up new possibilities in spaceflight

One of the biggest factors that make space travel so expensive is the fact that most of the equipment used to put cargo or people in orbit is destroyed after each use.

Estimates vary, but SpaceX has publicly said that building a new Falcon 9 rocket costs $54 million. Using it to put a payload into orbit, by contrast, uses up only about $200,000 worth of fuel. There are some refurbishment costs that have to be taken into account, but the bottom line is that developing a reliably reusable launch system — whether just the engine or the entire rocket — would inevitably reduce the cost of spaceflight.

In recent years, the business of launching satellites into space has become an increasingly crowded field. These aerospace companies compete on per-launch prices, whether their clients are telecom companies, militaries, or government space agencies.

This is why these companies are suddenly racing to develop reusable systems. But the really exciting thing here is that if this competition actually does drive down the cost of spaceflight, it could eventually open up entirely new sorts of missions, like space tourism in Earth's orbit or human exploration of Mars.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994226694107056}",neutral,0.9994226694107056,0

It said the investigators made the judgment after completing preliminary analysis of the airplane's digital flight data and cockpit voice recorders.

Airbus blames the failures on a software problem.

Two members of the crew survived the crash.

Airbus says the aircraft was under flight trials at the airport and was scheduled to be delivered to a Turkish buyer.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9998775720596313}",negative,0.9998775720596313,-1

Airbus developing reusable space rocket launcher - Phys.org,"Sun, 07 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE1LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1yZXVzYWJsZS1zcGFjZS1yb2NrZXQtbGF1bmNoZXIuaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE1LTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1yZXVzYWJsZS1zcGFjZS1yb2NrZXQtbGF1bmNoZXIuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Ariane, built by Airbus Defence and Space. Airbus has unveiled plans for a reusable space rocket launcher that should be ready in 2025

European aircraft and aerospace giant Airbus has unveiled plans for a reusable space rocket launcher that should be ready in 2025, which the firm says will be radically different from the concept of rival US firm Space X.

Airbus must overcome significant technical and financial challenges, while the Space X company owned by South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, is already experimenting with its model.

Since 2010, a team of engineers has been secretly working at an Airbus warehouse at Les Mureaux, just outside Paris, looking for ways to reuse space rocket launchers.

They have a difficult task ahead because they must ensure that reuse ends up costing less than sticking to classic single-use models.

Now, as they give journalists access to their site, it appears their project might end up working.

Airbus has baptised the two phases of its reusable launcher concept Adeline and Space Tugs.

""The main stage launches and operates the rocket in the first phase of its journey. The later stage comes into action in the second part,"" said Francois Auque, director of Airbus's Defence and Space programme.

Adeline, which stands for ADvanced Expendable Launcher with INnovative engine Economy, is original because it combines space technology with aeronautics, said Herve Gilibert, technical director at Airbus Defence and Space.

An inflatable scale size model of ""Adeline"", short for Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy, a reusable Ariane rocket first-stage engine and avionics package, a project hoping to be operational in 2025-2030

""In order to reuse the main stage, we bring back the most expensive parts and try to make them in a way that they become much cheaper to reuse them than to make new ones,"" Auque said.

The idea is to recover the propulsion bay and the engine, which account for 80 percent of the launcher's total value, by putting them behind a heat shield that will protect them as they come back to Earth.

Like a plane

Adeline comes in the form of a stabiliser at the base of a launcher, and is outfitted with little wings and a turboprop engine. As with most aircraft, fuel is stored in the wings.

The Space Tugs concept calls for devices that will hover at an altitude of 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), which would be refuelled by new launchers with the help of satellite technology.

The plan is ""to stock them up in a space 'car park'"" for future use, Auque said.

A subscale model of ""Adeline"", short for Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy, a reusable Ariane rocket first-stage engine

Once Adelines have completed their mission, they are flown remotely like a drone to a landing strip.

As for how the reusable launchers would work, the principle is to have them take off like normal rocket, but land like a plane, said Auque, who wants to reuse the engine 10 or 20 times.

Gilibert meanwhile claims the Airbus project is superior because it is being designed to withstand more reuse than Space X's version.

Space X's project is also different because its launcher is being built to land on a vessel at sea.

Airbus estimates its module will require two tonnes of fuel to be brought back to Earth—half the amount its rival will need.

In terms of financing, the company is aiming for a 30 percent gain on the launcher's operating costs—estimated at $70 million (63 million euros) for the upcoming Ariane 6.2 launcher model that is equipped with a dual rocket booster.

Frontier to buy $1.3 billion of Airbus jets to add seats - The Denver Post,"Tue, 02 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMDIvZnJvbnRpZXItdG8tYnV5LTEtMy1iaWxsaW9uLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1qZXRzLXRvLWFkZC1zZWF0cy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE1LzA2LzAyL2Zyb250aWVyLXRvLWJ1eS0xLTMtYmlsbGlvbi1vZi1haXJidXMtamV0cy10by1hZGQtc2VhdHMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frontier Airlines Inc. will buy 12 Airbus Group NV single-aisle jets valued at $1.3 billion to replace its smallest, oldest planes with larger models that boast more seats.

The aircraft will let Frontier accelerate moving out its Airbus A319s before receiving other deliveries already on order, CEO Barry Biffle said this week.

Including the latest purchase, Frontier’s fleet will grow 80 percent over five years to 101 planes.

The changes help curb expenses by putting more people on each plane, a pillar of Frontier’s shift to becoming a so-called ultra-low-cost airline with discounted base fares and charges for any extras, such as carry-on bags.

Flying bigger jets puts Frontier, majority-owned by private-equity firm Indigo Partners, in the midst of an industry trend while also increasing the supply of seats on each of the airline’s routes.

“Our plans are to be the lowest-cost carrier in the U.S.,” Biffle said. “To do that, you have to be as efficient as possible.”

The order will consist of 10 A321s and two A320s. The former are Airbus’ biggest narrow-bodies, and their 230 seats are 67 percent more than on an A319. The A320s will have 186 seats. Frontier’s current A320s have 168 seats, according to Seatguru.com.

“From a cost perspective, the change is massive,” Biffle said. The more seats on a plane, the less it costs to operate on the basis of each seat flown 1 mile, an industry measure of efficiency. Frontier will retain its 24-seat Stretch section, which offers more legroom.

The two A320s will be delivered next year and the A321s in 2016 and 2017, said chief financial officer Jimmy Dempsey.

Frontier took its first Airbus aircraft in 2001 and now flies only planes from the A320 family, which allows it to save on costs by streamlining crew training and maintenance operations.

Airbus’ A320 family is the world’s best-selling single- aisle jet, with about 11,700 orders to date, according to Airbus.

Frontier, which hasn’t expanded seating capacity in a decade because of bankruptcy and two changes in ownership, expects to average 15 percent annual growth over the next several years with the planes in the combined orders, Dempsey said.

“We would have had some challenges in the next two years, where our fleet might have either been not growing year over year or might have temporary periods of shrinking” without the incremental order, Biffle said.

Each A321 carries a list price of $113.7 million, while the A320s are valued at $97 million apiece, according to Airbus. Airlines that buy multiple planes usually negotiate discounts. The planes’ engines will be made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and France’s Safran SA.

Indigo Partners purchased Frontier from Republic Airways Holdings Inc. in December 2013.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.770053505897522}",neutral,0.770053505897522,0
Airbus works to make 10-abreast A350 a smidge more comfortable - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXdvcmtzLXRvLW1ha2UtMTAtYWJyZWFzdC1hMzUwLWEtc2xpY2UtbW9yZS1jb21mb3J0YWJsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Less than a handful of Airbus A350 XWB customers have selected a 10-abreast configuration in economy class for the twinjet, which has been advertised in the past as offering individual seat width of just 16.4”. But Airbus has been quietly working on a configuration that would enable airlines to offer a seat that will be just shy of 17″ at 10-abreast, the airframer confirms.

Though “we haven’t launched it” yet, says Airbus executive VP, strategy and marketing Dr. Kiran Rao in relation to the smidge-more-room 10-abreast layout, “you can play with the angles on the sidewalls and you can play a little with the armrest and then you can be very clever with the design of the seat. It will be 16.8” or 16.9”, something like that.”

This compares to the A350’s standard 9-abreast layout with 18” wide seats, which offers “a very comfortable layout” that 99% of customers have chosen, says Rao.

“We have been able to demo a [near] 17” seat at 10-abreast on the A350,” he reveals.

AirAsia X flies 9-abreast Airbus A330s (which offer seat width of 16.5”, according to SeatGuru), and, according to Rao, AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes has confided that passengers on the A330 – generally smaller in size than the average westerner – don’t complain.

But he admits that while airlines can get away with offering 17″ or less on longhaul flights of 12 to 14 hours, and “people will put up with it”, the configuration is far from ideal and “it’s simply not comfortable”.

In offering sub 17″ seats on its newest widebody, Airbus is entering somewhat dodgy territory insofar as the 9-abreast Boeing 787 with 17″ seat width or below is already inspiring passengers to write songs about their discomfort in-flight. And Airbus has already ruffled feathers by tweaking its A380 to accommodate 11-abreast with 18″ wide seats in comparison to the 19″ standard 10-abreast layout on the super jumbo.

Rao is the first to admit that the difference between 17” and 18” width is noticeable. He notes, for instance, that he recently flew on an A320 narrowbody that had been configured with wider aisles and 17” wide seats (deviating from the standard 18” wide seat on the A320 as compared to the standard 17” wide seat on the 737), and that he recognized the difference immediately.

But, he explains, “we have a few customers for regional operations that will choose a narrower seat. If you’re doing regional flights, with the A330 or potentially the A350, then a sub 17” seat works for them. And if they want to go 10-abreast, we offer the choice. The point of my story is that we offer the choice. Boeing cannot offer the choice therefore they are forced to give all of their customers a narrow seat, and in turn, their customers offer an inferior product.”

The Airbus executive stresses that the economics of the A350 don’t require airlines to “go to that level of compromise”, and declines to disclose the airlines which have chosen 10-abreast for the traditionally 9-across aircraft, saying “I can’t give you the names of the customers.” Flightglobal in May 2012 reported that AirAsia X had ordered its A350s in two-class configuration, with 10-abreast in economy.

However, Fernandes this spring suggested at the CAPA Aviation Summit that the carrier isn’t taking A350s when he said, “We’ve given up on the A350.” AirAsia “fought hard with Airbus for the [re-engined] A330neo, and we really believe in that aircraft”, which will support further growth, possibly to the US, he added.

MOBILE | The northern Gulf Coast’s burgeoning aerospace sector grew a bit more Tuesday when a German company that paints aircraft said it would expand its operations near the Airbus plant under construction in Mobile.

Maas Aviation will construct a $39 million, twin-bay hangar for painting aircraft at the Mobile Aeroplex site at Brookley, the Mobile Airport Authority said. The project is expected to create 80 jobs.

The new facility will be used to service the market for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhauls in the Americas. Construction is expected to begin this fall and take about one year.

The company has another facility for painting aircraft that will be assembled at the Airbus plant in Mobile. Maas won that contract in April 2014.

Roger Wehner, the authority’s executive director, said he has been impressed by the company so far.

“The design process has included many embedded quality and efficiency elements which we believe contributes to their ability to compete on quality and speed, providing considerable value to operators,” Wehner said in a written statement.

The new project was announced in conjunction with the Paris Air Show in France. A French Airbus supplier, insulation fabricator Hutchinson Corp., announced plans Monday to locate in Mobile.

Airbus began construction in 2013 in Mobile on its first assembly plant in the United States. The factory will produce A319, A320 and A321 aircraft.

Assembly is expected to begin this year, with delivery of the first aircraft constructed in Mobile scheduled for next year. The $600 million plant is expected to employ as many as 1,000 people once production begins.

More than 90 aerospace companies are currently operating on the coast in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to Gulf Coast Aerospace Corridor, an industry website operated by specialty publisher and consultant David Tortorano.

North of the coast, central Alabama also is trying to attract work linked to Airbus.

The city of Birmingham, Airbus, and a regional chamber of commerce, the Birmingham Business Alliance, plan to hold a conference this fall for Airbus suppliers.

“We hope to create opportunities for Birmingham businesses and give the opportunity for the city to develop a closer relationship with Airbus,” Birmingham Mayor William Bell said in a statement from the air show in Paris. “This is a very exciting opportunity and an opportunity to create jobs in our city.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997507929801941}",neutral,0.9997507929801941,0

Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said the X6 would primarily target the oil and gas industry as well as search and rescue operations, meeting customer requirements for a more economical helicopter that can go farther.

He also said the X6 would be the company’s first civil helicopter to feature Airbus’s fly-by-wire technology, used in Airbus jetliners to keep aircraft within safe limits of the flight envelope.

Based on an artist’s rendering released by Airbus Helicopters, the X6 appears to share some of the technology of the recently unveiled H160 medium twin, including its sculpted five-blade main rotor and new materials in the fuselage and structure.

Highlighting the need for a successor product, the aging Super Puma design has been in production continuously since 1978. The original Puma on which it is based saw its first deliveries in 1968.

First flight of the X6 is expected within about five years with certification and initial deliveries in about a decade.

Introduction

June 1, 2015, c. Leeham Co. In preparing for my A350 flight I learned how to interact with the aircraft’s systems in Airbus A320/A330 simulators. These two are very similar and represent the first generation of Fly By Wire (FBW) aircraft from Airbus. When flying the A350 I knew it had taken the cockpit philosophy from A380 rather than these two. I was therefore a bit curious as to how much my training would be applicable. On a first glance the differences between A320 and A380 cockpits are considerable.

To prepare for flying A350 we were sent a “A350-900 Flight Deck and Systems Briefing for Pilots”. When starting reading it the reaction was “there is a lot to learn, quite a bit of systems are different”. In the A350 simulator before the flight it turned out most changes were natural and easy to comprehend. To understand what has changed and if it is for the better or not, lets go through the changes and explain how it works in A350.

Discussion

The most noticeable change from the A320/330/340 generation is that the cockpit now contains additional displays besides the usual line-up, Figure 1. These are for the Onboard Information System, OIS, displays which are displaying Electronic Flight Bag applications from stowed laptops.

The changed system architecture comes from A380 but with further refinements. One of these is the use of six identical large displays (A380 has eight normal standing avionics displays and two large OIS displays on the sides), making information sharing easier as system screens can be moved around the displays more freely as all have the same display format.

So can information from the OIS for e.g. a Take-off performance calculation be put on the upper central display for discussion between Captain and First Officer.

Onboard Information System (OIS) and Flight Management System (FMS) handling

The Onboard Information System, OIS, fulfills the function of an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) system. On top of displaying airport charts and airway information it contains performance applications for all phases of flight, a weight and balance application and a full line of aircraft documentation. Examples are Fligh Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) etc.

Information can flow from the aircraft’s avionics side to the OIS environment but not back. This is to make sure that nothing can interference with the flight safety critical avionics side. Therefore airlines can implement own applications in the OIS environment without endangering the flight safety of the aircraft.

The major difference from A380 is how the screens can be moved around in the cockpit, practically all information seen in Figure 2 can be reconfigured to be shown on another display in case of display failures or the need to share and discuss information.

The information on the screens is manipulated by two Keyboard and Cursor Control Units, KCCU, Figure 3.

The advantage with these compared to present generation input to the aircraft’s Flight Management System (FMS) is that these can control the information on all screens, also the OIS. The keypads on today’s Multifunction Control and Display Unit (MCDU), which control the FMS, they can only change information on the MCDU’s own screen, Figure 4.

This greater flexibility together with a more logical display of information from the FMS in a tabbed interface makes programming of the aircraft for the flight easier (Weights, Speeds, Flight plans, Radio aids, Fuel etc), Figure 5.

Both the MCDU in Figure 4 and the MFD (Multifunction Display) in Figure 5 show parts of flight plans. As can be seen in Figure 5 it is much easier to read the A350 information, among other things Track (TRK) is shown between waypoints which is not done on a MCDU.

The cursor is also moving to next logical position when one hits ENTer (ENT on lower right side of keypad) to confirm a KCCU input which makes navigation in the pages simple. Navigation on the classical MCDU takes some getting used to, it uses an “enter in scratchpad” and “then allocate” principle for entering information. To move the cursor between displays on A350 one just rolls them over to the next display, simple and fast to learn.

Inputs with the KCCU is made by clicking with the right mouse button (Validation pb) on the info, then entering the information. When hitting ENTer on the keyboard or a second click with the Validation (mouse) button the cursor moves to the next item in check-lists or input screens, it becomes natural immediately.

For working with the OIS there are two keyboards stored above the pedals. These can be dragged back to be easily reached when in cruise. The keyboard can not be used to manipulate information on any other system other then the laptops that control the OIS.

Flight information displays

The normal use of the six displays is shown in Figure 6. New display areas are the lower parts of the pilots Primary Flight Display, PFD, and Navigation Display, ND, and a Mailbox for communication with ATC over ATC datalink or ARINC 623 communication protocols is added over the Warning Display.

The improved Primary Flight Display, and Navigation Display, can be seen in more detail in Figure 5. It has now flaps and trim information underneath the PFD and the ND has a vertical display of the flight plan including a terrain profile from the Terrain Awareness and Avoidance System, TWAS. Having the vertical display of the aircraft’s planned path is a big improvement to the horizontal only display of earlier aircraft generations.

The engine displays have also been improved. Previous generation displays mixed GE/CFM’s N1 thrust setting style with Rolls-Royce’s and Pratt & Whitney’s EPR principle. This made the display dependent on the engines that were fitted to the aircraft one flew. If one flew an A340 with CFM engines one day and a Trent 700 equipped A330 the other, one would change the way one would work with engine thrust.

A380 introduced Airbus generalized thrust display where 100% is full thrust, much easier to understand.

A350 continues this much easier to understand thrust setting principle and display, Figure 7.

Improved runway operation

The flight phase which has the most incidents is the landing phase, especially during the braking phase and the turning off to the taxiways. Airbus has worked on several improvements to reduce the risk of landing incidents, ranging from warning systems for runway overrun (becoming active on the landing’s final, called Runway Overrun Warning, ROW) to immediately applying max braking with Runway Overrun Protection, ROP, should the pilot not honor the warning and go around for a better approach or alternate runway.

The useful Brake To Vacate (BTV) has been made standard on A350. By inputting runway condition to the Onboard Airport Navigation map and selecting what runaway exit one wants to use, BTV calculates and applies optimized auto-braking to have 10 kts ground speed 50 m before chosen taxiway, Figure 8. It saves brakes and the aircraft will leave the runway faster.

My landing was done with BTV set to the M2 exit on Toulouse Runway 14L and it worked perfectly (M2 is at end of Runway 14L in picture. BTV is showing two magenta lines for min Dry and Wet turnoff in this picture, exit not yet selected).

Summary

A350 has inherited most system functions for the flight deck from A380 but these has been further refined to act in an even more intuitive and seamless way. The common type rating with A330 should therefore be no problem. The system functions which are changed are improvements of how things are done in A330, easier and more intuitive to accomplish. Therefore one learns these quickly.

During our media test flight none of the test pilots had any problems manipulating the improved FMS. Once the principle was clear it was natural to do it with a trackball and enter instead of the old fashioned way it is done on today’s MCDU. With the FMS interface being the largest change from A330 the other improvements are even easier to digest.

Report: Airbus transport crash caused by “wipe” of critical engine control data - Ars Technica,"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2Fyc3RlY2huaWNhLmNvbS9pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMTUvMDYvcmVwb3J0LWFpcmJ1cy10cmFuc3BvcnQtY3Jhc2gtY2F1c2VkLWJ5LXdpcGUtb2YtY3JpdGljYWwtZW5naW5lLWNvbnRyb2wtZGF0YS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus had already revealed that the fatal crash of an Airbus A400M military transport was caused by what was described as a ""quality issue in the final assembly"" of the electronic control units (ECU)—a fault in software configuration that led to a loss of control of the aircraft and resulted in the death of four crew members. Reuters reported additional details today provided by individuals familiar with the investigation into the crash, stating that a critical part of the configuration data in three of the aircraft's four ECUs—a file storing torque calibration parameters for each engine—was somehow ""accidentally wiped"" when the software was being installed. As a result, three of the aircraft's engines automatically shut down in flight.

Citing a safety document shown to Reuters, Tim Hepher reported that the pilot of the A400M would not have gotten an alert about the missing data until the aircraft was already at an altitude of 400 feet. No cockpit alert about the data fault would appear while the aircraft was on the ground. According to Hepher's sources, the lack of a ground warning was an issue raised during a safety review last year, but ""regulators approved it on the basis that the chances of failure were small and the installation procedure included extra checks,"" people familiar with the matter said.

The A400M, which was on a final test flight before delivery to the Turkish Air Force, reached an altitude of 1,725 feet after takeoff before crashing during an attempted emergency landing. The aircraft struck an electrical pole at about 180 miles per hour.

The missing data made it impossible for the aircraft's central control system to interpret data coming from the engines' sensors. The aircraft's software is designed to shut down malfunctioning engines to prevent them from affecting the operation of the aircraft. But a software failure of more than two engines was never taken into consideration.

The data wipe appears to have been caused by the computer system used to install the flight control software and update calibration data. Airbus has instructed its European NATO buyers of the A400M not to use that software. Safety officials are still investigating how safety checks failed to spot that the calibration data had been deleted.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9989891648292542}",negative,0.9989891648292542,-1
Airbus H160 helicopter makes its first flight - New Atlas,"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1oMTYwLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC8zODA1NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A couple of days ago, we heard how Airbus Helicopters had announced the concept phase of its planned X6 heavy-lift helicopter. That aircraft will borrow some features from the company's new H160 medium-lift model. Although the H160 was introduced at the Heli-Expo trade show back in March, its first flight took place on June 13th and was announced this week at the Paris Air Show.

The H160 is the most recent addition to Airbus' H generation of helicopters, and is reportedly both cleaner-running and quieter than its stablemates. It can be configured for applications such as offshore transportation, business and private aviation, public services, and commercial passenger transport.

Among its features is a lightweight full-composite airframe, which is said to contribute to the robustness of the aircraft while also requiring less maintenance. It also has a ""new generation"" Arrano turboshaft engine, which is reportedly more powerful than its predecessors while also being more fuel-efficient and producing 20 percent less CO2 emissions per passenger.

The aircraft's noise levels are lessened by up to 50 percent, both through the use of Airbus' swept-back Blue Edge rotor blades and a canted fenestron (a ducted fan-style tail rotor). The rotors and fenestron are also claimed to aid in stability, increasing passenger comfort. A biplane-type stabilizer on the tail additionally boosts performance and handling.

Finally, electrically-controlled landing gear allows the H160 to carry a heavier payload (exact figures aren't available) and lessens maintenance requirements.

Last Saturday's maiden flight can be seen in the video below.

An A400M plane crashed during a test flight on May 9 near Seville in Spain, killing four of the six people on board and seriously injuring the two others.

Initial analysis of the black boxes showed that three of the four engines had failed.

Airbus's chief executive Tom Enders told France's Europe 1 radio that the crash was a tragic event but that so far it had not had an impact on orders as countries that use the plane were convinced of its merits.

One of the advantages that the new turboprop offers is that it can take off on shorter runways and rough terrain with up to 37 tons of cargo and troops.

Enders said there was lots of interest in the aircraft, including in several countries in the Middle East and Asia, and that he hoped to sign more contracts in the near future.

The A400M has been flying throughout the week at the Paris Air Show, which runs until Sunday.

Even before the crash last month, the plane has been plagued by years of production delays and costly overruns.

European nations who pushed for the development of the aircraft had even considered canceling the program at one point.

The first A400M was delivered in 2013, four years late and €6.2 billion ($7 billion) over budget.

A total of 174 have been ordered since, but the company has been having difficulty meeting its delivery schedule, prompting Airbus to shake up its management of the program in January.

It acknowledged at the time that with respect to ""the integration of military capabilities and the industrial ramp-up in particular, we have not been performing at the level which had been expected of us.""","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.998906135559082}",negative,0.998906135559082,-1

PARIS AIR SHOW: The A400M can do things no C-130 can. It’s much bigger than a C-130. The air platform is reportedly incredibly stable in flight, raising the possibility of launching rockets from it or putting high accuracy guns on it.

But it’s got a few problems. First, it’s European. Second, much of the senior Airbus leadership remains deeply scarred by their experience with their last big American sales effort, the failed attempt to sell the Air Force the A330 tanker, first with Northrop Grumman and then through their American subsidiary, then called EADS, now known as Airbus Americas.

UPDATE BEGINS The door for a visit was — encouragingly — left wide open this afternoon by the head of Air Force acquisition, Bill LaPlante. “In general, when we talk to Airbus, we think the more the merrier in terms of getting industry to think about our missions,” he said. “We understand there’s the history with the tanker.” He noted that, “we’ve been trying to bring Airbus in to our CEO roundtables.” UPDATE ENDS

I heard last year that Airbus was hopeful of beginning the briefing process in the Pentagon, catching the ear of some Air Force or Special Operations Command leaders.

But few American fliers know anything about the A400M Grizzly. It’s much bigger than the C-130 since it was designed to give Europeans something they didn’t have: strategic lift. It can carry big loads a long way. For example, the French military can now fly a helicopter to the fight aboard an A400M instead of shipping it in pieces and reassembling it.

But an A400M crashed in May, killing four crew members. Incorrectly installed flight software was found to be the cause. This morning, with French President Francoise Hollande watching. an A400M soared over the field at Le Bourget Airport, completing some combat climbs and sharp turns to demonstrate the plane is back and remains safe.

Now the company must decide the benefits and risks of bringing an A400M or two to the United States to show off its impressive capabilities. Will American lawmakers reflexively oppose a European plane, even one from an ally as staunch as France has been since 9/11? The Army is buying the Lakota helicopter from Airbus Military. In fact, the Lakota is on display in the American corral here at the show.

If I were an Airbus executive and wanted to test the market, I couldn’t think of a better way to do it than bringing the A400M to America for a week or two and showing off its capabilities — especially to SOCOM. We’ll see what they decide.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9886773824691772}",negative,0.9886773824691772,-1
Airbus supplier adding second painting facility in Mobile - Alabama Today,"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYWx0b2RheS5jb20vYXJjaGl2ZXMvMzkzNy1haXJidXMtc3VwcGxpZXItYWRkaW5nLXNlY29uZC1wYWludGluZy1mYWNpbGl0eS1pbi1tb2JpbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The northern Gulf Coast’s burgeoning aerospace sector grew a bit more Tuesday when a German company that paints aircraft said it would expand its operations near the Airbus plant under construction in Mobile.

Maas Aviation will construct a $39 million, twin-bay hangar for painting aircraft at the Mobile Aeroplex site at Brookley, the Mobile Airport Authority said. The project is expected to create 80 jobs.

The new facility will be used to service the market for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhauls in the Americas. Construction is expected to begin this fall and take about one year.

The company has another facility for painting aircraft that will be assembled at the Airbus plant in Mobile. Maas won that contract in April 2014.

Roger Wehner, the authority’s executive director, said he has been impressed by the company so far.

“The design process has included many embedded quality and efficiency elements which we believe contributes to their ability to compete on quality and speed, providing considerable value to operators,” Wehner said in a written statement.

The new project was announced in conjunction with the Paris Air Show in France. A French Airbus supplier, insulation fabricator Hutchinson Corp., announced plans Monday to locate in Mobile.

Airbus began construction in 2013 in Mobile on its first assembly plant in the United States. The factory will produce A319, A320 and A321 aircraft.

Assembly is expected to begin this year, with delivery of the first aircraft constructed in Mobile scheduled for next year. The $600 million plant is expected to employ as many as 1,000 people once production begins.

More than 90 aerospace companies are currently operating on the coast in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to Gulf Coast Aerospace Corridor, an industry website operated by specialty publisher and consultant David Tortorano.

North of the coast, central Alabama also is trying to attract work linked to Airbus.

The city of Birmingham, Airbus, and a regional chamber of commerce, the Birmingham Business Alliance, plan to hold a conference this fall for Airbus suppliers.

“We hope to create opportunities for Birmingham businesses and give the opportunity for the city to develop a closer relationship with Airbus,” Birmingham Mayor William Bell said in a statement from the air show in Paris. “This is a very exciting opportunity and an opportunity to create jobs in our city.”

Premium Economy costs more (and less) than Airbus suggests - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 06 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvcHJlbWl1bS1lY29ub215LWNvc3RzLW1vcmUtYW5kLWxlc3MtdGhhbi1haXJidXMtc3VnZ2VzdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Airbus’ count 27 airlines now offer a full premium economy class with a recliner seat — not just an extra legroom economy cabin like United’s Economy Plus. That’s an increase in the number of premium economy carriers from just nine in 2008, and given that the class was launched in 1993 (by Virgin Atlantic or EVA Air depending on who you ask) the spike is impressive.

It’s even up by one since April, when VP marketing Ingo Wuggetzer quoted a cost multiplier of 2x economy at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg in March, compared with the 1.5-2x economy quoted by EVP strategy & marketing Dr. Kiran Rao at the Airbus Innovation Days in Toulouse in May — which is at the other end of the spectrum from the “couple of extra hundred euros” over economy quoted by chief operating officer customers John Leahy recently in Toulouse.

The disparity, given the price of economy fares — and the fire-sale business class deals available this year on transatlantic routes — made me think, so I did some brief back-of-an-envelope analysis to see which was more accurate.

Methodology

I took five example routes with both economy and premium economy, using USD pricing from Kayak.com for one adult return nonstop flight November 10-17, far enough out that fares would be representative. I chose routes based on competition in premium economy (where I assumed fares would be keenest, thus trending towards a lower multiplier between a same airline’s economy and premium economy fares) and geographic diversity, and am quoting fares in USD at 1.098 to the Euro.

I also took the cheapest economy fare on any airline and the cheapest premium economy fare on any airline to calculate the lowest cross-airline multiplier, giving the real “cheapest nonstop economy vs cheapest premium nonstop economy” answer that most passengers will really be looking at.

For the UK flights, premium economy is newly subject to the £142 Band B Standard rate of UK Air Passenger Duty for this flight of over 2001 miles while economy is charged the Reduced rate of £71. That’s a difference of $108.56 at the exchange rate on the day of searching, and out of interest I removed that amount before calculating the multiplier a second time; it didn’t make much difference.

Route 1: LHR-LAX

London to LA has an unusual three airlines with premium economy: British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand (on a fifth freedom flight continuing from Auckland). Interestingly, despite significantly higher prices for Air NZ’s premium economy when purchased AKL-LAX-LHR, Air NZ was very competitive here, particularly given that it offers its Spaceseat product on this route.

• BA: PE $1907 / Y $741 / multiplier 2.6x, adjusted for APD 2.4x

• VS: PE $1907 / Y $1100 / multiplier 1.7x, adjusted for APD 1.6x

• NZ: PE $1984 / Y $726 / multiplier 2.7x, adjusted for APD 2.6x

BA and Virgin both had the cheapest premium economy at $1907, while Air NZ had the cheapest economy at $726, which gives a lowest fare multiplier of 2.6x, or 2.5x adjusted for APD.

Route 2: JFK-LHR

I winced at the price of economy between Kennedy and Heathrow, but it’s something I’ve noticed for a number of years now. It seems to me that the cartel pricing by the transatlantic alliances on this route is really problematic for cheap fares — especially since non-aligned fifth freedom airlines Air India and Kuwait Airways were a third less on the same route. (Yes, it’s generally less reliable and the passenger experience isn’t great, but New York to London is still a ripoff in economy.)

• BA: PE $1546 / Y $1098 / multiplier 1.4x, adjusted for APD 1.3x

• VS: PE $1546 / Y $1098 / multiplier 1.4x, adjusted for APD 1.3x

BA and Virgin had identically priced premium economy at $1546, though Air India was significantly cheaper in economy, giving a lowest cross-airline multiplier of 2.2x, adjusted for APD 2.1x.

Route 3: SYD-HKG

With both Cathay Pacific and Qantas in the Sydney-Hong Kong market for premium economy, I was interested to note that prices are surprisingly different. Given the rather frosty relationship between these two oneworld members, I did consider this a route of competition rather than collusion.

• QF: PE $1227 / Y $728 / multiplier 1.7x

• CX: PE $1485 / Y $676 / multiplier 2.2x

Qantas had the cheapest premium economy at $1227, while Cathay, giving a lowest cross-airline multiplier of 1.8x across the market

Route 4: NRT-FRA

JAL and Lufthansa offer

• JL 2142 / 772 / multiplier 2.8x

• LH 2147 / 774 / multiplier 2.8x

JAL had both the cheapest economy (equal to ANA) and the cheapest premium economy, giving the lowest cross-airline multiplier of 2.8x

LAX-SYD

• VA 2332 / Y $1319 / multiplier 1.8x

• QF 2439 / Y $1336 / multiplier 1.8x

Virgin was both the cheapest economy and the cheapest premium economy, giving the combined cross-airline multiplier of 1.8x.

Premium economy fares seem a fair bit higher than John Leahy suggests

While this is only an initial fare analysis, Airbus should perhaps ensure that its cost suggestions are accurate and realistic. Nowhere is premium economy the “couple of extra hundred euros” John Leahy suggests, even within the same airline. Even in the JFK-Heathrow market, it’s over twice that, more than $450 over economy.

The average multiplier for each market (including the cross-airline multiplier and using the APD-removed numbers for the UK flights) was:

• LHR-LAX 2.3x

• JFK-LHR 1.6x

• SYD-HKG 1.9x

• NRT-FRA 2.8x

• LAX-SYD 1.8x

The “average of averages” turned out to be 2.1x — above Airbus’ 2x, but not by much. The 1.5-2x quoted by Airbus’ marketing staffers seems a little optimistic, and perhaps for accuracy “1.5-3x with an average of around 2x” might be preferable.

And lastly, this brief analysis suggests that a gap I’ve previously identified — serving the market of economy flyers who don’t want to pay two times the fare for two times the seat, but might be willing to pay 1-1.5 times the fare for extra width (perhaps in the form of an empty seat next to them) — is still underserved.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995644688606262}",neutral,0.9995644688606262,0

Airbus A380 faces uncertain future as airlines ask for changes - CNBC,"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMTYvcGFyaXMtYWlyLXNob3ctYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmFjZXMtdW5jZXJ0YWluLWZ1dHVyZS5odG1s0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTUvMDYvMTYvcGFyaXMtYWlyLXNob3ctYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmFjZXMtdW5jZXJ0YWluLWZ1dHVyZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's been 10 years since Airbus ' A380 super jumbo first took to the skies, but despite winning rave reviews among passengers, airlines have not been quick to buy.

There hasn't been a new order for the plane, which can seat up to 853 passengers, for months and the company's largest customer, Emirates, has said they won't order any more unless modifications are made.

The Gulf carrier is the largest operator of the A380, with 60 currently in use and another 80 on the way. The airline has been asking Airbus to offer a revamped A380 Neo version with new Rolls Royce engines in addition to adding sharklets to its wingtips. The carrier claims these changes could equal a 10 percent greater efficiency for the aircraft.

Qatar Airways which currently operates five A380s also said they couldn't commit to any more orders.

Airbus has said it wouldn't commit to any future redevelopment of the plane at the moment, but the company's head of sales, John Leahy told reporters at the Paris Air Show that they are currently discussing future versions of the super-jumbo with a number of airlines.

""As far as I'm concerned, I don't have many A380s, I have five and I will receive another five and then maybe in the future we will firm up our options,"" Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways told CNBC.

Aviation analysts see Airbus as in a relatively difficult situation: If they decide to make modifications for future versions of the A380, it would be doing it at not only a huge cost, but a high degree of risk too.

Emirates is the only airline that has said it would order a new version – generally aircraft manufacturers won't invest millions on changes.

""The problem the airlines have is filling it (the A380) and if they can't do that, then it's just simply not economic,"" Dominic Perry from Flight Global said.

""So Airbus has to convince them that it doesn't need 600 or 800 people or whatever, it is more about offering something that no other plane can.""

The crash May 9 killed two pilots and two flight test engineers. The crash remains under investigation.

Three of the hulking gray aircraft's four turboprop engines suffered what it called ""power frozen"" after lift-off, and failed to respond to the crew's efforts to regain control. A fourth engine responded normally. No other problems have been identified by the preliminary analysis.

Airbus says the A400M's eight-bladed turboprop engines are the most powerful in production. They are built by a consortium made up of Rolls Royce, Snecma, MTU and ITP.

The A400M can carry 116 fully equipped paratroopers or carry up to 37 tons of cargo, including armored vehicles and helicopters.

Last month Airbus sent a so-called Alert Operator Transmission notice to all operators of the giant airlifter, warning them of the need to perform checks of its Electronic Control Units before they are next flown.

Airbus said investigators' latest analysis is consistent with that AOT and doesn't call for any further recommendations.

Four of the five countries that already have A400Ms — Britain, Germany, Malaysia and Turkey — grounded the plane after the crash. France, which has six, says it will only use the aircraft in urgent operations.

The 20 billion euro A400M program saw its first deliveries in 2013. Some 174 aircraft have been ordered by eight countries — including Spain — to replace their aging military transport fleets. Twelve of the aircraft were delivered as of March, with Malaysia's air force being the most recent customer. A further five aircraft were due to be delivered to Germany this year, but Airbus has notified the German government to expect delays.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9837400317192078}",neutral,0.9837400317192078,0

Philadelphia will be the first city in the United States to land regular passenger service on the new Airbus A350.

Qatar Airways, the world's first airline to begin flying the A350, will put the the A350 on its Philadelphia flights starting Jan. 1. The carrier currently flies one daily round-trip between Philadelphia and its hub in Doha on Boeing 777 jets.

""We are very pleased to announce the launch of our first A350 service to the United States,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker says in a statement.

""Philadelphia is the sixth largest metropolitan area in the USA and is an important international business hub that is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies,"" he adds. ""With the launch of the new A350 service from January 1st next year, Qatar Airways will be further strengthening its position in Philadelphia and the U.S. overall as an airline offering passengers a world-class travel experience.""

Qatar Airways also revealed plans to put its new A350s on other U.S. routes. Beginning March 1, Qatar Airways will begin using the jet on one of its flights to New York. And on March 16, the carrier will begin using the jet on its service between Boston and Doha.

The A350 is the latest brand-new aircraft type to be introduced by either Airbus or Boeing, the world's two biggest aircraft manufacturers.

Qatar Airways became the first carrier in the world to take delivery of the jet late last year. And, in January, Qatar Airways was the first to put the A350 into regular revenue service when it debuted the jet on a route between Doha and Frankfurt.

The A350 also will likely be the last completely new aircraft from the world's two big jetmakers for the foreseeable future. Neither Boeing nor Airbus currently have any all-new models under way, meaning it could be a decade or longer until passengers see another all-new aircraft type produced by either of them.

The A350 is the third all-new aircraft to be rolled out by either Airbus or Boeing during the past decade. It joins Airbus' superjumbo A380 – which debuted in 2007 – and Boeing's new-age 787 ""Dreamliner,"" which made its first flight for an airline in 2011.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5964697599411011}",neutral,0.5964697599411011,0

Under the pact, Singapore-based MRO provider ST Aero will be the programme and technical lead in the development phase, while Airbus will provide OEM data and certification support. EFW will be responsible for driving sales and marketing activities.

The conversions will be done in EFW and ST Aero facilities in Asia, Europe and the USA, and the first converted A320/321 will be available to customers in 2018.

This follows a similar collaboration for the A330P2F conversion programme launched in 2013.

Airbus

Airbus is forecasting a demand for more than 600 narrowbodies to be converted to freighters over the next 20 years.

""This is the only Airbus-supported A320-family freighter conversion programme, and as such will take full benefit of our inherent design knowledge of the aircraft, our engineering know-how [and] the extensive operational experience from the thousands of Airbus single-aisle aircraft in service today,"" says Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams.

The A320P2F will have the capacity to carry 21 metric tonnes of payload over 2,100nm (3,890km), while the larger A321 variant will be able to carry up to 27 metric tonnes over 1,900nm (3,520km).

Airbus in 2011 cancelled its A320 P2F programme just before the Paris air show, citing strong growth in passenger traffic driving demand for used A320-family jets, reducing the number of aircraft available for conversions. Its partners then were EFW and Russian aerospace firms United Aircraft and Irkut.

"Airbus unveils Adeline, its clever answer to SpaceX's reusable rockets - Ars Technica","Mon, 08 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvMjAxNS8wNi9haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1hZGVsaW5lLWl0cy1jbGV2ZXItYW5zd2VyLXRvLXNwYWNleHMtcmV1c2FibGUtcm9ja2V0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has unveiled Adeline: its answer to SpaceX's reusable space launch ambitions. Adeline, which stands for Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy, uses a rather novel solution to get the first stage engines back in one piece: it has wings and propellers that allow the engines to follow a ballistic trajectory, and then fly like an airplane back to a runway.

All current space launch systems—SpaceX's Falcon 9, Airbus' Ariane 5, Russia's Soyuz, etc.—are expendable. During every single rocket launch, the rocket engines and fuel tanks fall back to Earth, usually into the ocean, never to be used again. Rocket engines are not cheap: Orbital Sciences paid around $1 billion (£600 million) to Roscosmos for 20 RD-180 rocket engines.

This is why companies like SpaceX, and now Airbus, are developing technologies that can bring the rocket engines back to the launchpad, so that they can be reused. SpaceX, which is currently leading the charge in this area, says that it wants to reuse rocket engines and fuel tanks within ""single-digit hours"" of their return. Depending on who you talk to, and the configuration of the rocket, current space launch prices are somewhere around $250-500 million; with reusable components, SpaceX wants to get that price down below $100 million.

Which brings us neatly onto Adeline. Airbus says that its reusable tech has been in secret development since 2010, but it won't be ready for use until at least 2025-2030; Ariane 6, due in 2020, is the company's current priority. Where SpaceX attempts to return the entire first stage (the big fuel tank and the rocket engines) to the launchpad, Adeline will return just the engines and the avionics, leaving the fuel tank to fall into the ocean as usual.

SpaceX and Airbus have very different methods of return, too. Falcon 9 keeps some fuel in reserve, which is used to slow the first stage's descent. Adeline detaches from the fuel tank, continues on a ballistic path, and then eventually uses winglets and propellers to land horizontally on a runway, a bit like a UAV. The main benefit of this method, at least as Airbus tells it, is that it requires much less fuel than SpaceX's method.

It's worth pointing out that most of the rocket's value is in the engines, not the fuel tank—though obviously, if SpaceX can safely land the fuel tank, that may make up for the additional fuel required. SpaceX hasn't successfully landed a Falcon 9 first stage, but it's getting pretty close. With Airbus focusing on Ariane 6 for now, SpaceX's reusable launcher should be ready quite a few years ahead of the competition.

So far, SpaceX and Airbus are the only two major players to announce their reusable rocket plans. The United Launch Alliance (Boeing-Lockheed) says its upcoming Vulcan may be partially reusable, though the plan is pretty wild: a helicopter will capture the falling engines mid-air. Russia, if it is working on reusable tech, hasn't announced anything yet.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999828577041626}",neutral,0.999828577041626,0

The A330 MRTT allows aircraft to take off with more weapons.

The A330 MRTT - a military derivative of the A330-200 airliner - was selected over Boeing's KC-46A, the military procurement agency in Seoul said, because of its price and performance as well as the amount of personnel and cargo it can carry. Israel Aerospace Industries also took part in the bidding process for the contract.

South Korea will buy four of the Airbus aircraft, for a total of 1.488 trillion won ($1.33 billion, 1.2 billion euros). The country joins Australia, Britain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Singapore in adopting Airbus' air-to-air refueling and transport aircraft.

South Korea's military air force procurement have overwhelmingly been met by US suppliers in the past - a reflection of their close military alliance. But European companies led by Airbus have also secured a series of military contracts.

In 2005, Airbus Helicopters won a contract for transport choppers called ""Surion"" in partnership with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). South Korea unveiled the first Surion helicopter in 2009.

In March this year, Airbus Helicopters inked a deal worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to build more than 300 civil and military helicopters for South Korea also in partnership with KAI.

Jerome Deulin Photo

Airbus Helicopters will be presenting four aircraft on the static display at the 2015 Paris Air Show.

The full scale representative model of the all-new highly innovative H160 will be presented for the first time in Europe. The H160 brings form and function together in a highly stylized rotorcraft, which integrates as many as 68 different Airbus Helicopters-patented technologies including the distinctive Blue Edge blades, canted Fenestron and biplane stabilizer. Its payload lift, range and efficiency make this helicopter ideally suited for a wide variety of uses, including oil and gas operations; public services, air medical and coast guard duties; along with commercial transport, private and business aviation.

A full-scale representative model of the newly certified H145M will also be showcased. This aircraft has an increased maximum take-off weight of 3.7 metric tons, and can be equipped with mission equipment that includes a pintle-mounted door gun and the ability to carry weapons on external pylons; electro optical/infrared sensors with targeting capability; as well as military avionics for communications, navigation and flight management.

A bestseller, with 60 aircraft currently in service worldwide and more than 430,000 flight hours, the H225M has proven its capabilities as a heavy, single-platform, modern and combat-proven helicopter on the market able to perform the widest range of missions, from combat search and rescue to special operations, tactical transport and medical evacuation, along with a full range of maritime roles. Since 2006, the H225M has been deployed in Lebanon, Afghanistan, Chad, Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, Somalia and Maliby the French Army. Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand also rely on the H225M for their most demanding missions.

The H135, certified in October 2014, is the reference helicopter for emergency medical services, thanks to its performance, its cabin flexibility and overall capabilities. Unique features such as the shrouded Fenestron rear rotor make the H135 more silent, efficient and safer for operators to use. The NH90 TTH Caïman from the French Army Aviation (ALAT) will be displayed at the NHIndustries booth and will be performing flight demonstrations every day.

The NH90 TTH has been operationally deployed in Afghanistan by Germany and Italy for tactical transport and medevac missions and in Mali by France for tactical transport missions, while the MRH90 has been deployed by Australia in the Philippines and the Vanuatu Islands. The NH90 TTH crews appreciate the maneuverability of the helicopter, its power to weight ratio, its outstanding endurance, and its capability to perform a wide spectrum of missions. It is fitted with a state-of-the- art mission system to ensure mission success day or night and a self-defense suite able to detect and counter the main threats on the battlefield.

The French General Directorate for Armament’s (DGA) booth will host a Tiger and a NH90 NFH, two aircraft that have been successfully deployed in operations. Since July 2009, Tigers have been deployed continuously by the French Army in different areas, such as Afghanistan, Libya and Sahel. While the deployment in Afghanistan and Libya has come to an end, Tigers are still supporting missions in Sahel, where, despite the difficult operating conditions, the Tiger has shown a very high level of availability and logged more than 2,050 flight hours since the start of deployment in January 2013. The NH90’s NFH version is the primary maritime weapon system in a surface fleet’s defense. Operating from shore bases or on surface vessels up to sea state 5, the helicopter is tailored for both anti-submarine (ASW) and anti-surface unit (ASuW) warfare.

Delta begins flying Airbus jet daily into Idaho Falls - East Idaho News,"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvZGVsdGEtYmVnaW5zLWZseWluZy1haXJidXMtamV0LWRhaWx5LWludG8taWRhaG8tZmFsbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After nearly 20 years, Delta Air Lines has begun flying big jets back into Idaho Falls Regional Airport.

Since May, an Airbus A320 has been flying in from Salt Lake City every night at 10:20 and leaving at 8 the next morning. Airport Director Craig Davis said that while the original plan was for a trial period, he has since been told the flights will be permanent.

Delta stopped flying 737s into Idaho Falls in the 1990s, opting instead to have Skywest provide service with Brasilia turbo-props and Canadair regional jets. The Brasilias are long gone, and the CRJs are reaching the limit the Federal Aviation Administration is willing to allow them to remain flying in United States airspace. “(They’re) timing out and being decommissioned, and the big question is what is going to replace them.

With 12 first class seats and 148 seats in the main cabin, the Airbus is a much larger and roomier plane. This is the same jet Frontier was briefly flying between Idaho Falls and Denver in 2014 (a new CEO changed the company’s business strategy, and Frontier pulled out of smaller markets). Davis said he does not know whether more big commercial jets will be coming to Idaho Falls, but sees the Delta flight as a positive sign.

On a less celebratory note, he said he does not see fares out of Idaho Falls coming down until Delta and Alaska Air settle the feud they are having over the Salt Lake to Seattle route. At a recent conference he attended, an executive from one of the carriers told him that could take 12 to 18 months.

“Obviously we’d like to have Delta drop its rates,” he said.

Accenture and Airbus deliver wearable technology proof of concept for improving airplane cabin assembly - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyODM2NS9hY2NlbnR1cmUtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVyLXdlYXJhYmxlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktcHJvb2Ytb2YtY29uY2VwdC1mb3ItaW1wcm92aW5nLWFpcnBsYW5lLWNhYmluLWFzc2VtYmx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Accenture and Airbus have delivered a proof of concept, using the latest wearable technology, to help Airbus operators reduce the complexity of assembling cabin seats and decrease the time required to complete this task. Through this proof of concept, a manufacturing professional can use digitally enabled, industrial-grade smart glasses to improve the accuracy and reduce the time required to complete the cabin seat marking process. This proof of concept shows how wearable technologies offer new and important benefits in the aerospace and defense industry.

Using contextual marking instructions, the smart glasses display all required information for an operator to help mark the floor faster and reduce errors to zero. In addition, the eyewear technology, implemented by Accenture, also offers interactivity by granting the professional access to features including barcode scanning, data retrieval from the cloud, voice command, and augmented reality.

Using this technology, all aircraft’s seat locations can be marked down to the last millimeter and checked for accuracy and quality. This method also proved to be especially critical for removing errors in the process. Overall, time spent per aircraft is divided by six, error rate reduced to zero and marking operations have been revalued.

For this proof of concept, Accenture selected the most appropriate hardware, designed and implemented the full solution, and regularly integrated end user feedback to increase the professional’s satisfaction.

Accenture looks forward to building on this successful proof of concept with Airbus by making it widely used in commercial aerospace and defense manufacturing.

The project was launched in January 2015. Completion of the first prototype was completed less than a month later. To accelerate the timeline, Airbus and Accenture worked in start-up mode, which enabled rapid iterations by both companies’ professionals.

Currently, the technology is being industrialized for A330 cabin furnishing. The other Final Assembly Lines should quickly follow along with other Airbus divisions.

Wearable technology provides instant access to critical information, improves quality, and helps increase collaboration. This technology enhances existing workflows and opens new opportunities in many aspects of the aerospace and defense industry. Wearable technology may also increase workforce productivity, reduces the risk of errors and eliminates the need for travel. Using this hands-free technology also improves safety in complex assembly or maintenance activities.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",positive,0.9999970197677612,1
Airbus Intros New All-Electric Aircraft Prototype - SlashGear,"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWludHJvcy1uZXctYWxsLWVsZWN0cmljLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3RvdHlwZS0xNTM4ODI3OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus intros new all-electric aircraft prototype

Airbus is known for its huge passenger jets, but it has just debuted something out of the ordinary at the Paris Air Show. Airbus unveiled the E-Fan 2.0 prototype aircraft. It's an all-electric aircraft that claims to be the first ""plug-in plane"". It's a small, two-seater plane with a 31-foot wingspan. The plane is crafted from carbon fiber composite materials, keeping the aircraft light, weight only 1100lbs when empty.

The two-seater plane is only able to stay up in the air for about an hour. But, throughout that hour, it's nearly silent and has zero CO2 emissions. 120 lithium-ion polymer batteries are housed in the wings, powering twin 30kw engines that are capable of flight speeds up to 136 miles per hour.

Earlier this year, the solar-powered Solar Impulse 2 electric plane flew around the world. The plane took its time with the journey as its top speed was less than 50 miles an hour. So, the technology for long-haul flights from alternative energy sources exists, but is too slow to be utilized as mass transportation.

Airbus says that it wants to have an a 100-seat electric passenger plane by 2050. That's a far-fetched idea with a far-off date–in other words, the technology is nowhere near practical, yet. But, the E-Fan technology is currently being used by Airbus to build electric aircraft training models for flight schools. A four-seater E-Fan 4.0 is also in the works and it scheduled for production by 2019.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Helicopters will start a two-year development phase for a new model aimed at improving fuel-efficiency and comfort for civilian customers in markets such as search and rescue and the energy sector, it said at the Paris air show on Tuesday.

Reuters previously reported Airbus Helicopters planned to launch development of the X6, a long-awaited follow-up to its H225 Super Puma model, at the Paris show after the resolution of a standoff between parent Airbus Group (AIR.PA) and the French government over funding for the project.

Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the X6 -- a so-called ""heavy"" helicopter -- would primarily target the oil and gas industry as well as search and rescue services, and would meet customer demands for more comfortable helicopters that can go further.

""It will be smoother, more comfortable, lower levels of noise ... And a much higher level of fuel efficiency,"" he said.

He also said the X6 would be the company's first civil helicopter to feature Airbus's fly-by-wire technology, found in Airbus jets and which uses computers to fly the aircraft within safe limits.

Faury said he was ""keeping an eye"" on the potential sale of Sikorsky. United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said on Monday it was exiting the helicopter business and would decide by the end of the third quarter whether to spin off or sell its $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit, the U.S. military's largest helicopter maker.

Faury added Airbus Helicopters was getting some demands to postpone deliveries to customers due to the tough oil and gas market, but that there had been no cancellations so far.

He said the need for energy companies to reduce costs was even driving them to look at newer, more efficient helicopters, pointing to an order on Monday from lessor Milestone Aviation for H175 helicopters.

Power failures in three engines caused Airbus military plane crash in Seville - EL PAÍS USA,"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDE1LzA2LzAzL2luZW5nbGlzaC8xNDMzMzM5NTI1XzQ0NDgxMC5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTUvMDYvMDMvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzE0MzMzMzk1MjVfNDQ0ODEwLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Firefighters at the scene of the Airbus A400M accident on May 9. EFE

Power failure in three engines was the cause of an Airbus A400M crash in Seville on May 9, which claimed the lives of four people and seriously injured two others, officials said Wednesday.

According to the results of a preliminary investigation released by Airbus Defence and Space in a statement on Wednesday, pilots were unable to get engines 1, 2 and 3 to respond because of a computer software malfunction in the military transport aircraft’s engine control unit (ECU), which prevented the plane from gaining sufficient speed during takeoff. Officials likened it to “a power freeze.”

The preliminary analysis has demonstrated that the rest of the systems on the plane were functioning normally”

Only the fourth engine responded adequately.

The A400M, which was undergoing tests at the time of the accident, crashed into an electricity pylon shortly after alerting air traffic control that it was experiencing problems. A witness said that “almost the entire plane turned into ash.”

The incident prompted several countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, to suspend the use of the A400M.

The engine control unit is part of the aircraft’s full authority digital engine control system (FADEC), the computer that controls the plane’s propulsion. On May 19, Airbus ordered inspections of the FADECs in its entire A400M fleet.

“The preliminary analysis has demonstrated that the rest of the systems on the plane were functioning normally and no other defects were detected during this flight,” the company said in a statement.

The conclusions, which have been turned over to the Spanish judge investigating the crash, were obtained with the help of the flight data and voice recorders and a preliminary review conducted by a team from the Defense Ministry’s Commission for Technical Investigations of Military Aircraft Accidents (CITAAM).

Airbus said the inquiry would continue and that “updates in the case will be released when new relevant information is available.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9282565712928772}",negative,0.9282565712928772,-1

Airbus beats Boeing in South Korean tanker competition - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy1pbi1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYW4tdGFua2VyLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLzExNzQ3Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space this week added South Korea to its growing list of A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) operators after the nation downselected the tanker type over Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus and Israel Aerospace Industries’ 767-based design.

South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration announced the selection decision on 30 June, citing the performance and price of the European tanker over the US and Israeli alternatives.

The $1.26 billion KC-X programme aims to deliver four tankers by 2019, and the selection of Airbus is an important victory for the company as it looks to an upcoming Japanese tanker competition.

Boeing had expressed confidence before the decision, touting estimates that the KC-46A it is developing for the US Air Force will cost 25% less to own and operate over its life-cycle compared with the A330 MRTT, despite being a more expensive aircraft up front. However, Airbus offers a much larger aircraft compared with the 767-based KC-46A, and it can carry 111t (245,000lb) of fuel and up to 300 troops.

“This contract will also allow Airbus Defence & Space to establish a long-term and sustainable cooperation with the Korean industry,” says company spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma. “We will carry out our contractual obligations faithfully and are looking forward to executing this programme in a timely and efficient way as we have done with other A330 MRTT contracts.

“The decision means that the A330 MRTT has won every tanker competition outside of the United States since it entered the market, and has now been selected by nine nations plus the European Defence Agency.”

Airbus Defence & Space

The decision to go with a European supplier shows that South Korea is prepared to break from the tradition of buying American military hardware, following multi-billion-dollar commitments last year to procure the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and three Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned air vehicles.

""While we are disappointed with this decision, we remain committed to our partnerships in Korea,” says Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey.

Boeing’s KC-46 programme is running behind schedule, and is yet to conduct the first full-up KC-46A tanker flight. The first 767-2C engineering and manufacturing development aircraft recently flew an airworthiness test fitted with a boom and wing aerial refuelling pods. Still, Boeing can claim the largest base customer, the US Air Force, with 176 orders expected initially and potentially up to 400 as the aging KC-135 is retired.

Meanwhile, Airbus already has 35 solid orders on its books from six countries, and has delivered more than 24 aircraft to date. The tanker has also been selected by India (six aircraft) and Qatar (two). France is boosting its tanker order to 12, and the European Defence Agency is exploring options to acquire several aircraft that would be operated jointly.

One of Boeing’s biggest selling points was interoperability with the US fleet. The KC-46 will be certified to refuel more than 64 receiver types at little or no cost to the foreign customer, Boeing says.

However, Korea is not alone in the Pacific. The Royal Australia Air Force – which operates Super Hornets and, soon, F-35As – was the tanker type’s launch customer and it has already completed several refuelling certifications.

Singapore has also ordered six aircraft, and in Europe and the Middle East – Korea would dovetail on the established MRTT programmes of the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and UAE.

Its chief executive simultaneously moved to allay Spanish concerns about its workers carrying the blame for the accident, which has been linked in part to a software installation error. The plane crashed minutes into a pre-delivery test flight on May 9, prompting Spain to halt similar flights and thus effectively suspending deliveries of the troop and cargo plane. ""We hope to be able to fly our production aircraft soon. There are two aircraft ready to start the delivery process as soon as the temporary suspension of the license has been lifted,"" an Airbus Defence & Space spokeswoman said on Sunday. On Saturday, Spain's defense minister was quoted as saying the Madrid authorities had scheduled a meeting with Airbus on Monday to pose a series of questions following the crash. ""If the answers to the questions are positive, test flights of the grounded prototypes will be restarted and, from there, the authorization for the others will start being granted. It's all about allowing the company to implement the corrections they consider appropriate and to continue to operate, which is what we want,"" Pedro Morenes told newspaper El Pais. He also warned against scapegoating Spanish workers over the incident. ""As Fernando Alonso (head of Airbus' military aircraft division) said, this is not a problem of Seville, Toulouse or Hamburg, but of Airbus. The responsibility of this company's products is the company itself, independently of where they're produced."" A senior Airbus executive was quoted last month as blaming the crash on poor quality controls in Seville where the A400M is completed. The remarks ruffled feathers in Spain, where an investigation is continuing into the causes of the crash. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders sought on Sunday to smooth the concerns. ""I fully agree with Pedro Morenes, it is a matter for Airbus as a whole and not just Sevilla or our hardworking and extremely dedicated people producing the A400M,"" Enders said in remarks relayed by the spokeswoman. He expressed full confidence in Alonso to take the right decisions on the A400M together with Spanish authorities.

Airbus' A380 proves jumbo-sized challenge for global airlines - South China Morning Post,"Sun, 07 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MTgxMzkvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcHJvdmVzLWp1bWJvLXNpemVkLWNoYWxsZW5nZS1nbG9iYWwtYWlybGluZXPSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21wYW5pZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS8xODE4MTM5L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXByb3Zlcy1qdW1iby1zaXplZC1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtZ2xvYmFsLWFpcmxpbmVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The superjumbo, operated by 13 airlines around the world, has proved a blessing for some since it entered service eight years ago but a curse for others. The more than 500 passengers needed to fill it can either mean efficient use of a slot with low unit cost, or being stuck with a fuel guzzler burning around US$10,000 worth of fuel an hour.

The German airline will become the eighth carrier to operate A380s in Hong Kong this year, but A380 flights into and out of the city have dropped from a peak of 63 in January last year to between 42 and 55 a month this year, according to the Centre for Aviation.

Lufthansa will boost its capacity between Hong Kong and Europe by 20 per cent from October when it switches to an Airbus A380 on its Hong Kong-Frankfurt route, but the world's biggest passenger plane has not proved a sure-fire winner for all 13 carriers operating the double-decker behemoth.

Saj Ahmad, chief analyst of London-based consultancy StrategicAero Research, said: ""Apart from Emirates, there don't really seem to be a lot of success stories to the A380.""

China's largest airline, China Southern, the only Chinese A380 customer, says it will deploy the superjumbo on its Beijing-Amsterdam route from this month - its first international A380 route from the home base of rival Air China. While not considered as prime as Beijing-Paris or Beijing-London, the Amsterdam route is a long overdue route out of the capital for China Southern, which has only been allowed to fly domestic routes or international routes into and out of Guangzhou since taking delivery of the first of its five A380s four years ago.

Company insiders say the A380s have been causing the airline losses of ""at least 1 billion yuan"" (HK$1.2 billion) a year, although the difficulties in filling the seats had eased over the past year.

Will Horton, an analyst with the Centre for Aviation, said: ""Clearly China Southern's A380 experience has not gone to plan. The aircraft saw very low utilisation and then were deployed on leisure markets as something of a measure of last resort … the A380's large size makes it challenging to profitably fill. At Emirates you have different economics since you have A380s feeding A380s for transfer traffic - that brings scale.""

Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier admitted in April that it was disappointed to have won just won 317 orders for the A380, less than a third of the 1,200 orders it had projected for its first 20 years. The world's biggest airlines, based in the United States, have not ordered one.

Ahmad said the A380 could be ""a prime revenue driver"" in today's market where ""business class is the new first class"" for a lot of blue chip airlines, provided their network allowed them to capture enough of such high-yield traffic.

""The A380 works well for Emirates because of its geographic location, whereby it can rapidly add capacity to busy markets like Europe, the USA and Australasia,"" he said. ""Dubai is a huge connective hub and Emirate's strategy of passenger connections through Dubai on A380s is what has made that jet work for them.""

The fundamental issue with the A380 is that it has been beaten into submission by more advanced, cheaper to fly and more economical jets like the B777, B787 and A350 Saj Ahmad, StrategicAero

But the same could not be said for other A380 operators.

Ahmad said Singapore Airlines had dropped one A380 flight from London's Heathrow airport because of competition and failing traffic, while the likes of China Southern and Thai were struggling to fill their jets.

""The fundamental issue with the A380 is that it has been beaten into submission by more advanced, cheaper to fly and more economical jets like the B777, B787 and A350 … airlines simply aren't interested in trying to fill a behemoth - to do that, fares and yields would fall and hurt profitability,"" Ahmad said.

Malte Haut, Lufthansa's general manager for Hong Kong, Macau and South China, said replacing the B747-8 currently used on its Hong Kong-Frankfurt route with the A380 meant adding more than 120 seats per flight.

""It's almost like adding another plane,"" he said. ""But I don't think the economics would be as good if we were to add another frequency.""

He said he expected initial yield weakness, as was the case with all new capacity deployment, and for demand to pick up from business traffic beyond Hong Kong in Southern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.

Three of the aircraft's four turboprop engines suffered ""power frozen"", says company

Airbus says three of the four engines on an A400M military plane failed before it crashed near Seville last month, killing four people.

In a statement, Airbus Defence and Space said the faulty engines were confirmed by Spanish accident investigators after completing their preliminary analysis of the aircraft's digital flight data and cockpit voice recorders.

Three of the aircraft's four turboprop engines suffered what it called ""power frozen"" after lift-off, and failed to respond to the crew's efforts to regain control.

A fourth engine responded normally. No other problems have been identified by the preliminary analysis.

Airbus says the A400M's eight-bladed turboprop engines are the most powerful in production. They are built by a consortium made up of Rolls Royce, Snecma, MTU and ITP.

The A400M can carry 116 fully equipped paratroopers or carry up to 37 tons of cargo, including armoured vehicles and helicopters.

In May Airbus sent a so-called Alert Operator Transmission notice to all operators of the giant airlifter, warning them of the need to perform checks of its electronic control units before they are next flown.

Airbus said investigators' latest analysis is consistent with the AOT and does not call for any further recommendations.

Four of the five countries that already have A400Ms – Britain, Germany, Malaysia and Turkey – grounded the aircraft after the crash. France, which has six, says it will only use the aircraft in urgent operations.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9476315379142761}",negative,0.9476315379142761,-1

Leading U.S., Russian, European and Mideast military officials will also attend the show, to make deals and show off rival technologies at the world's oldest air show.

Demand is high for single-aisle jets such as Airbus' A320neo and Boeing's 737 MAX, and fuel-efficient planes are expected to remain popular among airlines despite lower oil prices this year. Analysts expect about 300-400 plane sales overall, lower than previous years in part because no major new jets are on the market.

Fallout from two recent plane disasters—a Germanwings passenger jet crash in the Alps and a military jet crash in Spain—will also be felt at the huge industry event.

French President Francois Hollande kicks off the event with a speech Monday at Le Bourget aerodrome northeast of Paris.

France-based Airbus led the unofficial orders race at the Farnborough Air Show last year and the Paris Air Show the year before, but Boeing is dominating the wide-body market this year.

Though the air show sales may be less frenzied than in the past, both leading planemakers see big business in the long term: Airbus' 20-year outlook is for 31,350 new passenger aircraft and freighters worth $4.6 trillion, while Boeing's equivalent forecast is for 36,770 aircraft worth $5.2 trillion.

Airbus will be showcasing its A400M military cargo jet with daily demonstrations at the Paris Air Show—seeking to quiet concerns about the jet following a deadly crash in May. Airbus has said that three of the plane's four engines failed in the crash in Seville, Spain. Several countries suspended their A400Ms.

Remains of victims of another disaster, a Germanwings crash in the Alps in March, are being returned to families in Spain on Monday, days after a French prosecutor released new details about the troubled co-pilot who locked the pilot out of the cockpit and slammed the plane into a mountainside.

The show, expecting some 300,000 visitors from the public and the $700 billion aerospace and defence industry, opens to the public Friday and runs through June 21.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9617156386375427}",neutral,0.9617156386375427,0

This week's edition—about the safety paradox of airplane automation—can be played below. Or keep reading to learn more.

On the evening of May 31, 2009, 216 passengers, three pilots, and nine flight attendants boarded an Airbus A330 in Rio de Janeiro. This flight, Air France 447, was headed across the Atlantic to Paris. The takeoff was unremarkable. The plane reached a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet; passengers read, watched movies, and slept. Everything proceeded normally for several hours. Then, with no communication to the ground or air traffic control, Flight 447 suddenly disappeared.

Days later, several bodies and some pieces of the plane were found floating in the Atlantic Ocean. But it would be two more years before most of the wreckage was recovered from the ocean’s depths. All 228 people on board had died. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorders, however, were intact, and these recordings told a story about how Flight 447 ended up in the bottom of the Atlantic.

The story they told was about what happened when the automated system flying the plane suddenly shut off, and the pilots were left surprised, confused, and ultimately unable to fly their own plane.

The first so-called autopilot was invented by the Sperry Corp. in 1912. It allowed the plane to fly straight and level without the pilot’s intervention. In the 1950s the autopilot improved and could be programed to follow a route.

By the 1970s, even complex electrical systems and hydraulic systems were automated, and studies were showing that most accidents were caused not by mechanical error but by human error. These findings prompted the French company Airbus to develop safer planes that used even more advanced automation.

Airbus set out to design what it hoped would be the safest plane yet—a plane that even the worst pilots could fly with ease. Bernard Ziegler, senior vice president for engineering at Airbus, famously said that he was building an airplane that even his concierge would be able to fly.

Not only did Ziegler’s plane have autopilot, it also had what’s called a fly-by-wire system. Whereas autopilot just does what a pilot tells it to do, fly-by-wire is a computer-based control system that can interpret what the pilot wants to do and then execute the command smoothly and safely. For example, if the pilot pulls back on his or her control stick, the fly-by-wire system will understand that the pilot wants to pitch the plane up, and then will do it at just the right angle and rate.

Importantly, the fly-by-wire system will also protect the plane from getting into an aerodynamic stall. In a plane, stalling can happen when the nose of the plane is pitched up at too steep an angle. This can cause the plane to lose lift and start to descend.

Stalling in a plane can be dangerous, but fly-by-wire automation makes it impossible—as long as it’s on. Unlike autopilot, the fly-by-wire system cannot be turned on and off by the pilot. However, it can turn itself off. And that’s exactly what it did as Flight 447 made its trans-Atlantic flight.

When a pressure probe on the outside of the plane iced over, the automation could no longer tell how fast the plane was going, and the autopilot disengaged. The fly-by-wire system also switched into a mode in which it was no longer protecting against aerodynamic stall. When the autopilot disengaged, the co-pilot in the right seat put his hand on the control stick—a little joysticklike thing to his right—and pulled it back, pitching the nose of the plane up.

This action caused the plane to go into a stall; yet, even as the stall warning sounded, the pilots couldn’t figure out what was happening to them. If they’d realized they were in a stall, the fix would have been clear. “The recovery would have required them to put the nose down, get it below the horizon, regain a flying speed and then pull out of the ensuing dive,” says William Langewiesche, a journalist and former pilot who wrote about the crash of Flight 447 for Vanity Fair.

The pilots, however, never tried to recover, because they never seemed to realize they were in a stall. Four minutes and 20 seconds after the incident began, the plane crashed into the Atlantic, instantly killing all 228 people on board.

There are various factors that contributed to the crash of Flight 447. Some people point to the fact that the Airbus control sticks do not move in unison, so the pilot in the left seat would not have felt the pilot in the right seat pull back on his stick, the maneuver that ultimately pitched the plane into a dangerous angle. But even if you concede this potential design flaw, it still raises the question: How could the pilots have a computer yelling “stall” at them and not realize they were in a stall?

It’s clear that automation played a role in this accident, though there is some disagreement about what kind of role it played. Maybe it was a badly designed system that confused the pilots, or maybe years of depending on automation had left the pilots unprepared to take over the controls.

“For however much automation has helped the airline passenger by increasing safety it has had some negative consequences,” says Langewiesche. “In this case it’s quite clear that these pilots had had experience stripped away from them for years.” The captain of the Air France flight had logged 346 hours of flying over the preceding six months. But within those six months, there were only about four hours in which he was actually in control of an airplane—just the takeoffs and landings. The rest of the time, autopilot was flying the plane. Langewiesche believes this lack experience left the pilots unprepared to do their jobs.

Complex and confusing automated systems may also have contributed to the crash. When one of the co-pilots pulled back on his stick, he pitched the plane into an angle that eventually caused the stall. But it’s possible that he didn’t understand that he was now flying in a different mode, one that would not regulate and smooth out his movements. This confusion about how the fly-by-wire system responds in different modes is referred to, aptly, as “mode confusion,” and it has come up in other accidents.

“A lot of what’s happening is hidden from view from the pilots,” says Langewiesche. “It’s buried. When the airplane starts doing something that is unexpected and the pilot says ‘Hey, what’s it doing now?’—that’s a very very standard comment in cockpits today.”

Langewiesche isn’t the only person to point out that “What’s it doing now?” is a commonly heard question in the cockpit. In 1997, American Airlines Capt. Warren VanderBurgh said that the industry has turned pilots into “children of the magenta” who are too dependent on the guiding magenta-colored lines on their screens. Langewiesche concurs: “We appear to be locked into a cycle in which automation begets the erosion of skills or the lack of skills in the first place and this then begets more automation.”

However potentially dangerous it may be to rely too heavily on automation, no one is advocating getting rid of it entirely. It’s agreed upon across the board that automation has made airline travel safer. The accident rate for air travel is very low: about 2.8 accidents for every 1 million departures. (Planes made by Airbus, by the way, are no more or less safe than those from its main rival, Boeing.)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9169323444366455}",neutral,0.9169323444366455,0
Airbus boosts aircraft demand forecast by almost 4pc on Asia growth - South China Morning Post,"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MjI1NDkvYWlyYnVzLWJvb3N0cy1haXJjcmFmdC1kZW1hbmQtZm9yZWNhc3QtYWxtb3N0LTRwYy1hc2lhLWdyb3d0aNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlLzE4MjI1NDkvYWlyYnVzLWJvb3N0cy1haXJjcmFmdC1kZW1hbmQtZm9yZWNhc3QtYWxtb3N0LTRwYy1hc2lhLWdyb3d0aA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus increased its long-term forecast for aircraft demand by almost 4 per cent yesterday on growth from China and the rest of Asia, as Asian airlines shone at the opening day of the Paris air show with large aircraft orders.

""Asia-Pacific will lead in world traffic by 2034 and China will be the world's biggest aviation market within 10 years, and clearly Asia and emerging markets are the catalyst for strong air traffic growth,"" Airbus's chief operating officer (customers), John Leahy, said.

Indonesia's national carrier, Garuda Indonesia, announced plans to buy up to 90 next-generation planes in total from both Airbus and Boeing with a list value of more than US$19 billion, accounting for the bulk of some 200 orders the two plane-makers combined received by midday in Paris.

Garuda Indonesia said it intended to purchase 30 A350s from Airbus, 30 B787-9s and up to 30 B737 MAX 8s from Boeing. Taiwan's EVA Airways also announced it planned to buy five Boeing 777 freighters. Airbus raised its forecast for global demand for new aircraft by 1,226 to 32,585 planes worth US$4.9 trillion in the next 20 years and highlighted the role played by emerging economies including China, where the percentage of people taking a flight a year would triple by 2034 from only 25 per cent today. ""Emerging economies which collectively account for six billion people, are the real engines of worldwide traffic growth,"" it said in a press release.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1

Airbus unveils ambitious Adeline reusable launch system concept - New Atlas,"Mon, 08 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1jb25jZXB0LXJldXNhYmxlLWxhdW5jaC1zeXN0ZW0tYWRlbGluZS8zNzkzMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence andSpace has unveiled its concept for a reusable first stage launchvehicle to compete with SpaceX's reusable space launch system. The ADvanced Expendable Launcher with INnovative engineEconomy (Adeline) would preserve the main engines andavionics of the company's next generation Ariane 6 and otherlaunch vehicles, for use in later missions.

According to Airbus,the components contained in the Adeline re-entry module would accountfor around 70 to 80 percent of the total value of the launch vehicle.Therefore, if the ambitious concept were to become reality, it wouldrepresent a significant step towards creating a highly affordable andversatile launch solution. But more importantly, Adeline would help to solidify the company's position in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

The system, located atthe base of a launch vehicle, is essentially a detachable, protectivemodule, designed to act as the thrusters and guidance system for themain stage of an Airbus rocket. Having fulfilled its primaryobjective of liberating the upper stage of an Ariane launch vehiclefrom Earth's atmosphere, Adeline would return to Earth and readied to do it all again.

Here's how a perfectexecution of the Adeline system would work in practice. Once thefirst stage of the launch vehicle reaches the end of its usefulness,it separates from the rocket's second stage. During this process, theheat-shielded Adeline detaches itself from the fuel tank that makes up the bulk of the first stage, and undertakes a ballisticflight back through Earth's atmosphere.

Once atmosphericre-entry is complete, Adeline behaves much like a conventional UAV, flying on winglets, and propelled by twin propellers that deploy atthe rear of the module. If all goes to plan, Adeline would descend to its designated landing strip and safely touch down, after which itwould be refurbished, and readied to serve as the main stage ofanother Ariane rocket. Airbus has stated that the system could cut launch vehicle costs by up to 30 percent.

The approach is amarked contrast to the competing SpaceX system, which attempts tosalvage the entire first stage of a Falcon 9 launch vehicle byutilizing its main engine and soft-landing struts to execute apowered vertical landing. To date, testing of the SpaceX system hasbeen met with mixed results.

The Adeline system hasbeen in development since 2010. To date, Airbus has carried outsimulator testing, and has even flight tested a number of demonstrator models designed to develop key technologies.The company is aiming to be ready for the maiden launch of the Adeline system some time in the year 2025.

Beyond Adeline, Airbusis attempting to make the Ariane 6 launch vehicle as economicallyviable as possible with the use of upper stage tugs. The companybelieves that the upper stage of its next generation launch system could be used to drag satellites into a transfer orbit, or possibly even into their operational orbit. In such a scenario, the tugs would be designed to be reusable, with Airbus considering utilizing the probes to service and refuel existing satellites.
