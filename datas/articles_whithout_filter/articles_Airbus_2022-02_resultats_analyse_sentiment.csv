The ZEROe demonstrator has arrived - Airbus,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAyLXRoZS16ZXJvZS1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3ItaGFzLWFycml2ZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2022 marks a new and exciting phase for ZEROe – Airbus’ ambition to develop the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. The multi-year demonstrator programme has officially been launched with the objective to test a variety of hydrogen technologies both on the ground and in the air.

Introducing the ZEROe demonstrator show more show less The ZEROe demonstrator is a giant leap forward in our mission to bring hydrogen-powered aviation to reality. Discover how the hydrogen combustion technology will work on the A380 test platform.

In 2015, one of the most powerful engines ever developed for an Airbus aircraft was approaching the final stages of development. But before it could be fitted to the A350-1000 aircraft for which it was destined, the engine needed to be flight and ground tested – a common practice for new technologies before entry-into-service.

That is why, on a pleasant autumn day, the aircraft equipped with the development engine took off from Airbus’ facilities in Toulouse. The test flight lasted 4 hours and 14 minutes, and analysed the performance of a wide range of power settings at altitudes of up to 35,000 feet.

But it was not the A350-1000 used for the test flight: it was the A380 MSN1 – the first-ever A380 to roll off the production line.

The A380 is the world’s largest and most spacious passenger jet ever built – a size that makes it ideally suited to the role of test platform.

Today, the A380 MSN1 test aircraft is earmarked for a new role: to take the lead on testing the technologies that will be vital to bringing the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft to market by 2035.

“The A380 MSN1 is an excellent flight laboratory platform for new hydrogen technologies,” says Mathias Andriamisaina, Airbus ZEROe Demonstrator Leader. “It's a safe and reliable platform that is highly versatile to test a wide range of low-carbon technologies. In addition, the platform can comfortably accommodate the large flight test instrumentation that will be needed to analyse the performance of the hydrogen in the hydrogen-propulsion system.”

Demonstrators: testing tomorrow’s technologies today

A demonstrator aircraft is fundamental to developing new aviation technology. It is primarily used to test and prove the viability of designs, processes, fuels, materials and equipment, both on the ground and in the air. This information is then used to refine and certify the finished product. Demonstrators also serve to showcase innovation to a wider audience, from government officials and investors to journalists and the general public.

Airbus has a long track record of launching demonstrator programmes to test pioneering technology. The E-Fan family, for example, highlighted the potential for all-electric flight. The Vahana and CityAirbus demonstrators have proven invaluable in furthering Airbus’ vision for urban air mobility. And, most recently, the E-Fan X was used to test the potential of hybrid-electric propulsion.

The ZEROedemonstrator will now be the next to test groundbreaking low-carbon aviation technologies. It will carry four liquid hydrogen tanks in a caudal position, as well as a hydrogen combustion engine mounted along the rear fuselage. The liquid hydrogen distribution system will feed into a conditioning system in which the liquid hydrogen will transform into its gaseous form before it is introduced into the engine where it is combusted for propulsion.

“This isn’t Airbus’ first experience with hydrogen-powered flight,” Mathias explains. “From 2000 to 2002, Airbus was a key partner in the European Union’s Cryoplane research project. Building on these academic inquiries, we’re proud to take the testing of hydrogen combustion to the next level.”

Unveiled in 2022, the ZEROe demonstrator uses an A380 multimodal platform to test hydrogen combustion technology.

Collaborating for low-carbon aviation

The hydrogen combustion engine is a key part of the ZEROe demonstrator programme. Engine manufacturers have been working hand-in-hand with Airbus on demonstrator programmes for decades. And the ZEROe demonstrator will be no exception.

CFM International, a joint venture between GE and Safran, is set to develop the hydrogen combustion engine and prepare it for testing. Specifically, the company will modify the combustor, fuel system and control system of a GE PassportTM turbofan to run on hydrogen. The engine was selected due to its physical size, advanced turbo machinery, and fuel flow capability.

Each technology component – the hydrogen tanks, hydrogen combustion engine and liquid hydrogen distribution system – will be tested individually on the ground. Then, the complete system will be tested first on the ground and then subsequently in flight. The first flight is expected to take place in the next five years.

The A380 MSN1 is an excellent flight laboratory platform for new hydrogen technologies. It's a safe and reliable platform that is highly versatile to test a wide range of low-carbon technologies.

Airbus to test hydrogen-fueled engine on A380 jet - CNN,"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXRlc3QtaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbGVkLWVuZ2luZXMtb24tYTM4MC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXRlc3QtaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbGVkLWVuZ2luZXMtb24tYTM4MA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Airbus just moved one step closer to launching the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035.

The French aircraft maker has announced plans to test hydrogen fuel technology using a modified version of one of its A380 jetliners, which were discontinued last year.

Airbus has partnered with CFM International, a joint venture between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, on the hugely significant hydrogen demonstration program.

The plane manufacturer will use an “A380 flying testbed fitted with liquid hydrogen tanks” to trial propulsion technology for its future hydrogen aircraft.

‘Flight laboratory’

“Our ambition is to take this (A380) aircraft and add a stub in between the rear doors at the upper level,” says Glenn Llewellyn, vice president for zero emission aircraft at Airbus, in a video posted on the Airbus YouTube channel. “That stub will have on the end of it a hydrogen powered gas turbine.”

He goes on to explain that the aircraft will be fitted with hydrogen storage and hydrogen distribution, which will feed its engine with the chemical element.

According to Llewellyn, the aim of the “flight laboratory” is to learn more about hydrogen propulsion systems in real ground and flight conditions, thus enabling Airbus to press on with its plans for a zero-emission aircraft in just over a decade.

Test flights are currently estimated to take place in 2026, provided everything goes to plan. The news comes over a year after Airbus unveiled three hydrogen-based concepts under the ZEROe banner.

“This is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,” Sabine Klauke, chief technical officer for Airbus, said in a statement.

“By leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.”

Guilt-free flying?

Aviation generates 2.8% of global CO2 emissions, and the global fuel consumption by commercial airlines reached 95 billion gallons in 2019.

The global aviation industry has pledged to slash emissions to half their 2005 levels by 2050.

A number of air carriers are moving towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to help reduce the environmental impact of flying, with British Airways’ parent company IAG revealing plans to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and United Airlines completing its first successful flight by 100% sustainable fuel last year.

However, Airbus is hedging its bets on hydrogen, which can potentially reduce aviation’s carbon emissions by up to 50%, according to the airplane manufacturer.

“I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact,” says Guillaume Faury, chief executive for Airbus.

Meanwhile, aviation firm ZeroAvia is currently developing a 19-seater aircraft that will operate commercial hydrogen-electric flights between London and Rotterdam from 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983313679695129}",neutral,0.9983313679695129,0
Airbus and CFM reveal ZEROe demonstrator aircraft - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yMi9haXJidXMtYW5kLWNmbS1yZXZlYWwtemVyb2UtZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"February 22, 2022, © Leeham News: Airbus and the CFM partners, GE Aviation and SAFRAN, presented a ZEROe Sustainability demonstrator today that builds on a heavily modified A380 prototype.

On the rear roof of the A380, a pylon is integrated where a hydrogen combustion GE Passport engine is mounted, feed with hydrogen from a sealed enclosure on the main deck that contains four liquid hydrogen tanks.

The choice of the A380 for the demonstrator allows a lot of test equipment and test engineers to be housed in the test aircraft, monitoring the functioning of the propulsion system.

The demonstrator will start the flight tests end of 2026 to prepare decisions around the 2035 Hydrogen passenger aircraft configuration for 2027.

Why this engine placement on an A380

The choice of the test engine for hydrogen combustion, the GE Passport Biz-jet engine used in the Bombardier Global 7500 long-range business jet, is because it’s light enough to mount in the dorsal position at the rear of the A380. It also has the modern core engine architecture that is important for the trials with H2 combustion and study of the H20 and NOx gas residues that form from this combustion.

The placement high up and separate from the A380’s main engines is important. An essential part of the flight trials is to measure how the water vapor from the burn of H2 with the air’s Oxygen forms into water vapor contrails.

This formation and how it affects the environment is the critical issue with H2 combustion versus letting it react with Oxygen in a fuel cell, producing electricity. The fuel cell process also generates H2O, but now in a liquid form that does not create contrails.

By putting the engine high up and inside the main engines, the converted Passport engine’s exhaust stream can be measured well separated from the A380 main engine exhausts by a trailing measurement aircraft.

The installation in the A380

The placement of the different parts of the hydrogen propulsion in the first A380 test aircraft, MSN01, is shown in Figure 2.

The four tanks are placed in a special sealed container, suspended off the main floor at the rear of the cabin, Figure 3.

The MSN01 A380 is ideal as a test aircraft as these tests are all about collecting as much data as possible around the behavior of the Cryogenic (-253°C) tanks, their piping, and valving for filling, feeding, and venting of the hydrogen and how the engine runs.

The substantial MSN01 test racks will be updated with test computers and gear for these tests. The whole installation will be tested on the ground before test flights start end of 2026. Before the installation in MSN01, each component has endured endless tests in ground test environments.

The different tanks, some CFRP (Composite) and some Metallic, start their testing this year in Bremen, Nantes, and Madrid (Airbus cryogenic tank design centers).

The A380 is ideal as a ZEROe test aircraft as it has the volume, power, and facilities for the extensive testing of the tanks and engine, Figure 3.

The data from the test will be processed in real-time, both at the aircraft by test engineers and by ground crews, through data link feeds, Figure 4.

What does this mean for the 2035 Airbus hydrogen airliner?

Does the announcement today mean the airliner that will come to market by 2035 will be a hydrogen combustion solution?

The flight testing of the combustion engine is to find out if the contrail problem is real and how serious it is. Is it a problem at all, and if so, can technical solutions or operational procedures alleviate the problem?

As I have written in my Corner series, a gas turbine with hydrogen combustion is a solution that is technically more straightforward than the route over a fuel cell and electric motors driving the fans or propellers. GE has eight million hours of H2 Gas Turbine combustion experience from ground gas turbine installations, so converting a gas turbine to hydrogen is a known technology.

The advantage of the fuel cell is the absence of a contrail problem and no NOx emissions (these will remain but be reduced five times with H2 gas turbines versus today’s carbon-burning engines). So the fuel cell is a true ZERO emission solution, but there are substantial installation challenges to master as fuel cell systems are heavy and produce more heat than electrical power when running.

Airbus works both these technical solutions with its partners, and the decision which way to go will be made in 2027 after these trials are done.

We can expect to hear more about Airbus Fuel Cell activities as these technologies are brought to maturity in different ground rigs.

Airbus Helicopters and Parts Town Share How They're Delivering a Better B2B Digital Buying Experience - Mirakl,"Wed, 02 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJha2wuY29tL2Jsb2cvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWFuZC1wYXJ0cy10b3duLXNoYXJlLWhvdy10aGV5cmUtZGVsaXZlcmluZy1hLWJldHRlci1iMmItZGlnaXRhbC1idXlpbmctZXhwZXJpZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commerce is becoming increasingly digitized, and the B2B sector is no different. Collective sales on B2B marketplaces grew 130% year over year in 2021 – totaling more than $56 billion. As buyers become more comfortable with making business purchases online, companies are coming under new pressures to deliver an overall better shopping experience: one defined by increased product selection, better delivery options, and more competitive pricing.

Platform Pioneers Parts Town and Airbus Helicopters sat down with Mirakl, as part of our Platform Pioneer Executive Symposium series, to discuss how they’re delivering a modern commerce solution for an increasingly digital audience. I had the honor of moderating a session entitled, How to Deliver a Better B2B Digital Buying Experience Through a Marketplace, which featured Emanuela Delgado, SVP of the Revolution at Parts Town, and Paul Louit, Head of Marketplace at Airbus Helicopters.

In the session, Delgado and Louit shared how the marketplace model has allowed them to stay at the forefront of innovation in their respective industries. With online marketplaces powered by Mirakl, they’re able to exceed rising customer expectations – leading to enhanced customer loyalty and sustained growth.

Parts Town: Using the marketplace to deliver a one-stop shop

Parts Town is a leading technology-enabled distributor of genuine OEM food service parts and an early adopter of eCommerce, starting their digital journey in 2007 with the launch of their website. Then, in 2018 they began researching a marketplace solution in response to growing buyer demand.

“We really heard from our customers and saw the trends that people wanted a one-stop shop,” noted Delgado. “They loved shopping on our site, but were asking for more product categories. So, we searched for a way to bring experts in those areas onto our platform, and provide that one-stop shopping experience.”

With a marketplace, Parts Town saw a way to fulfill a variety of different customer needs. To start, the model allowed them to launch Parts In Town in 2020: a program that leveraged partnerships with local service companies, dealers, and distributors to deliver more of their customers, across the country, OEM parts in under an hour. Now, Parts Town offers their clients same-day fixes without the costs and manpower needed to expand Parts Town’s existing network of warehouses and distribution centers.

Following this success, Parts Town launched a new marketplace the following year. With the Parts Town online marketplace, powered by Mirakl, they were able to transform their site into a true “one-stop shop” expanding both their core catalog, while also introducing new verticals such as HVAC parts, janitorial supplies, and water filtration. With the marketplace platform, Parts Town now has a cost-effective, scalable way to enhance the customer experience, offering the same quality and product reliability they were known for, on a vastly expanded assortment of products.

Airbus Helicopters: How the marketplace model has led to aeronautical eCommerce innovation

Airbus Helicopters is the world's leading manufacturer of helicopters. They too started their Mirakl-powered marketplace project in 2018 to add additional value and service for their buyers. Louit explained, there are many highly specialized parts and products that go into maintaining and repairing helicopters – making it impossible for Airbus Helicopters to be an expert in everything.

“We needed a way to add items in categories we aren’t an expert in, and we found the marketplace was the best way to do so as we continue the digital transformation for the company,” Louit added.

With the marketplace, Airbus Helicopters could partner with experts in each area and deliver buyers a single site for all their helicopter needs. In addition to this added convenience, their customers appreciate how the marketplace has allowed them to make more informed purchasing decisions. With just a few clicks they can now compare items based on what’s most important to them - whether that’s price, lead time, or delivery options.

Airbus is leaving arch-rival Boeing behind in its engine wake - Fortune,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8xNy9haXJidXMtMjAyMS1lYXJuaW5ncy1wcm9maXQtYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXItYXJjaC1yaXZhbC1ib2VpbmctNzg3LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the pandemic receding into the background, Airbus is flying high and poised to pull away from Boeing as its archrival grapples with continued safety problems.

Deliveries of new Airbus aircraft are set to grow 18% to a total of around 720 this year, the company said, surpassing the 2017 level but still far from its pre-COVID record high of 863 planes.

“We have a lot on our plate for 2022,” chief executive Guillaume Faury told reporters on Thursday, after reporting record high annual profits. “Ramping up production of our A320 family will remain at the heart of our priorities, and we will continue to work closely with our suppliers to make it happen.”

By comparison, Boeing only managed 340 deliveries last year, barely more than half that of Airbus. It hasn’t even provided concrete guidance going forward.

That’s because the Chicago-based Boeing first has to complete rework or recertification for key aircraft families. Boeing has halted shipments of its 787 wide-body since last May owing to faults in the airframe, reportedly affecting parts made from carbon fiber composites as well as titanium. While it hopes deliveries of its 737 Max to customers in China can resume in the course of 2022, it said earlier this year the rate and timing remains unknown.

A legal dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways could give Boeing a tiny opening. Airbus took the highly unusual decision to cancel an order for 50 narrow-body A321neo planes placed by the Gulf carrier, which claims it has discovered paint degradation in its Airbus fleet that poses safety risks.

As a result, Boeing was able to scoop up an order for up to 100 planes at the end of January from the Middle Eastern airline.

Bulging order books

In its Thursday earnings announcement, Airbus reported record net income of €4.2 billion ($4.8 billion) and higher cash reserves on balance, prompting the group to reintroduce a €1.50 dividend per share.

This would be the first time it distributed cash to its investors since the company scrapped the planned 2019 payout worth €1.80 each at the start of the pandemic.

While Boeing, which reported in late January, more than halved its annual net loss in 2021, it still reported the company was $4.2 billion in the red owing mainly to a $3.5 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to the delivery delays in its 787 program.

Surprisingly, underlying demand is not a problem for either manufacturer despite the ailing health of many airline customers. They effectively carve up the global market for passenger and freighter aircraft between them and still sit on thousands of backlogged planes on their books.

Airbus registered 7,082 aircraft at the start of the year, one reason why it could afford to turn down the business from Qatar Airways. Meanwhile Boeing estimated it had over 4,200 valued at $297 billion. (There’s no equivalent value for Airbus as the company ceased reporting the list price of its models back in July 2019.)

Keeping their workers busy is not the problem then; if anything the airplane makers worry more about how quickly they can ramp up production at both their factories and those of their suppliers. It’s more a question of Airbus and Boeing juggling their delivery schedule to match the financial health of their customers.

Carriers that cannot immediately afford a plane they had ordered are bumped down the waiting list in favor of those like Irish budget group Ryanair that need added seat capacity to expand their routes.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9922881126403809}",negative,0.9922881126403809,-1
Airbus and CFM International to pioneer hydrogen combustion technology - Airbus,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1haXJidXMtYW5kLWNmbS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXRvLXBpb25lZXItaHlkcm9nZW4tY29tYnVzdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/Washington, 22 February 2022 – Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with CFM International, a 50/50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, to collaborate on a hydrogen demonstration programme that will take flight around the middle of this decade.

The programme’s objective is to ground and flight test a direct combustion engine fueled by hydrogen, in preparation for entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft by 2035. The demonstration will use a A380 flying testbed equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks prepared at Airbus facilities in France and Germany. Airbus will also define the hydrogen propulsion system requirements, oversee flight testing, and provide the A380 platform to test the hydrogen combustion engine in cruise phase.

CFM International (CFM) will modify the combustor, fuel system, and control system of a GE Passport turbofan to run on hydrogen. The engine, which is assembled in the US, was selected for this program because of its physical size, advanced turbo machinery, and fuel flow capability. It will be mounted along the rear fuselage of the flying testbed to allow engine emissions, including contrails, to be monitored separately from those of the engines powering the aircraft. CFM will execute an extensive ground test program ahead of the A380 flight test.

“This is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “By leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.”

“Hydrogen combustion capability is one of the foundational technologies we are developing and maturing as part of the CFM RISE Program,” said Gaël Méheust, president & CEO of CFM. “Bringing together the collective capabilities and experience of CFM, our parent companies, and Airbus, we really do have the dream team in place to successfully demonstrate a hydrogen propulsion system.”

CFM shares Airbus’ ambition of fulfilling the promise they made in signing the Air Transport Action Group goal in October 2021 to achieve aviation industry net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 by developing and testing the technology necessary to make zero emissions aircraft a reality within the ambitious timeline defined.

Airbus has a long-standing relationship with CFM and its parent companies, GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines and, together, the partners have established a great track record of delivering high-performance products that meet the needs of airline customers.

These included 52 H160s of which 30 were the first batch of H160M military versions for France’s Joint Light Helicopter programme. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased to € 13.7 billion (2020: € 11.9 billion), representing a book-to-bill ratio of around 1.3. Included were key orders in the Military Aircraft business such as the in-service support of the German and Spanish Eurofighter fleets as well as good export momentum for the C295, A330 MRTT and A400M airlifter.

Consolidated order intake by value increased to € 62.0 billion (2020: € 33.3 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 398 billion on 31 December 2021 (year-end 2020: € 373 billion). The increase in the backlog value mainly reflected the strengthening US dollar.

Consolidated revenues increased 4 percent to€ 52.1 billion (2020: € 49.9 billion), mainly reflecting the higher number of commercial aircraft deliveries, partially offset by less favourable foreign exchange rates. A total of 611 commercial aircraft were delivered (2020: 566 aircraft), comprising 50 A220s, 483 A320 Family, 18 A330s(1), 55 A350s and 5 A380s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 6 percent, largely reflecting the higher deliveries compared to 2020. Airbus Helicopters delivered 338 units (2020: 300 units), including the first H160, with revenues rising 4 percent reflecting growth in services and the higher deliveries. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased by 2 percent, mainly driven by Military Aircraft, partially offset by Space Systems. Eight A400M aircraft were delivered in 2021.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 4,865 million (2020: € 1,706 million).

The EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 3,570 million (2020: € 618 million), mainly driven by the delivery performance and efforts on cost containment and competitiveness.

Commercial aircraft production is progressing in line with previously announced plans, in a complex environment. Specifically on the A320 Family, the ramp-up is on trajectory to achieve rate 65 by summer 2023 and the Company continues to de-risk notably by enabling all assembly sites to become A321-ready. For A320 Family production rates beyond 2023, the Company is still in the assessment phase and working with suppliers to potentially enable an increase above rate 65.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 535 million (2020: € 471 million), mainly driven by support and services, programme execution and cost focus.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space increased to € 696 million (2020: € 660 million), reflecting continued cost containment.

On the A400M programme, development activities continued toward achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In the fourth quarter of 2021, a charge of € 0.2 billion was recorded mainly reflecting the updated estimates of the delivery pattern of the launch contract. This is reflected in EBIT reported.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 2,746 million (2020: € 2,858 million).

Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 5,342 million (2020: € -510 million), including net Adjustments of € +477 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +274 million related to the A380 programme, of which € +84 million were in Q4;

€ +122 million gain from the sale of one site in France, recorded in Q4;

€ -212 million related to the A400M, of which € -209 million were in Q4;

€ -38 million negative impact from foreign exchange and balance sheet revaluation, of which € +127 million were in Q4;

€ +331 million of other Adjustments including mainly around € 0.2 billion of provision release related to the restructuring plan, and payments by suppliers. € +285 million were booked in Q4.

The financial result was € -315 million (2020: € -620 million). It mainly reflects the net interest result of € -246 million as well as the revaluation of financial instruments and of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(2) was € 4,213 million (2020 net loss: € -1,133 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 5.36 (2020 loss per share: € -1.45).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was€ 3,515 million (2020: € -6,935 million), reflecting efforts on cash containment and a decrease in working capital, mainly driven by inventory improvement. Consolidated free cash flow was € 3,511 million (2020: € -7,362 million).

On 31 December 2021, the gross cash position stood at € 22.7 billion (year-end 2020: € 21.4 billion) with a consolidated net cash position of € 7.6 billion (year-end 2020: € 4.3 billion). The Company’s liquidity position remains strong, standing at € 28.7 billion at the end of 2021.

The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2021 dividend of € 1.50 per share to the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The payment date is 21 April 2022.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2022 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2022 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 5.5 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.5 billion.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance result and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position For the definition of the alternative performance measure net cash position, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6. FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Airbus signs agreement to study hydrogen hub in Singapore - Airbus,"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1haXJidXMtc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXRvLXN0dWR5LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWh1Yi1pbi1zaW5nYXBvcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 15 February 2022 – Airbus has signed a Cooperation Agreement with Changi Airport Group, global industrial gases and engineering company Linde and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)to study the potential for a future hydrogen hub in the city state.

The agreement was signed at the Singapore Airshow by Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer, Han Kok Juan, Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Yam Kum Weng, Executive Vice President of Changi Airport Group, and John Panikar, Executive Vice President, APAC of Linde.

It reflects the four partners’ shared ambition to leverage their respective expertise to support the decarbonization of the aviation industry and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Under the collaboration, the partners will look at how hydrogen can be transported, stored and delivered to aircraft at existing and new airports. This expands on an earlier agreement with CAAS to evaluate hydrogen infrastructures, widening the scope to include the airport and energy provider.

Airbus will provide characteristics on aircraft configuration and fleet energy usage, insight on hydrogen-powered aircraft for ground operations, and data on the estimated hydrogen aircraft ramp-up at airports.

“The Asia-Pacific region will play a key role as we work towards making climate-neutral aviation a reality,” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. “By partnering with Changi Airport and with Incheon Airport, Airbus will leverage the operational and technical expertise of two of the world’s leading hubs. The studies we will carry out together reflect the need for a cross-sectoral approach, including manufacturers, airlines, regulators, airports, energy providers and academia. We need bold and coordinated action to achieve our goals.”

The use of hydrogen to power future aircraft is not only expected to reduce significantly aircraft emissions in the air, but could also help decarbonise air transport activities on the ground. In 2020 Airbus launched the “Hydrogen Hub at Airports” programme to jumpstart research into infrastructure requirements and low-carbon airport operations, across the entire value chain.

To date agreements have been signed with partners and airports in Paris, Seoul and Singapore.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995771050453186}",neutral,0.9995771050453186,0

A350F: Five reasons why it will deliver freight in a smarter way - Airbus,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAyLWEzNTBmLWZpdmUtcmVhc29ucy13aHktaXQtd2lsbC1kZWxpdmVyLWZyZWlnaHQtaW4tYS1zbWFydGVyLXdhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"B

ased on the top-selling all new A350, the A350F brings latest-generation efficiency and choice to the large freighter market. If there are five things to know about the A350F they would be as follows:

The A350F offers unbeatable efficiency and sustainability in terms of fuel burn, CO2 emissions and economics, and it will be the first new freighter to meet the latest ICAO CO2 requirements. The A350F offers nose-to-tail innovation with advanced materials (including carbon fibre and titanium) for reduced maintenance and the highest operational availability in its class. The A350F offers superior economics due to the best combination of payload, volumetric capacity and range. The A350F can be seamlessly integrated into airline fleets, having spares and tooling commonality with the A350 passenger aircraft for airframe and engines, as well as “same type rating” for flight crews and ground technicians. The A350F is the future-proof choice for the large widebody freighter market.

Unbeatable efficiency and sustainability



With advanced aerodynamics and equipped with Trent XWB engines, the aircraft offers unbeatable efficiency in terms of fuel burn, CO2 emissions and economics – versus any other large category widebody freighter in operation today (eg 747F and 777F) or on the drawing board – such as the proposed 777-8F. This higher efficiency for the A350F is a decisive advantage versus the 2028 in-production deadline for the ICAO CO2 standard. The A350F’s advanced technology enables a step change of up to 40% better economic and fuel efficiency versus older generation freighters, such as the 747F.

The only true new generation freighter show more show less Based on the top-selling all new A350, the A350F brings latest-generation efficiency and choice to the large freighter market""



Nose to tail innovation with advanced materials for reduced maintenance high availability



The A350F is much lighter and less maintenance-intensive than its competitors, largely thanks to its structure which comprises over 70% advanced materials such as composites, titanium and modern aluminium alloys. Notably, the wings, the centre wing box and also the fuselage panels are manufactured mostly with composites. These materials choices result in a lighter, stiffer, stronger, more capable and cost-efficient aircraft, while increasing resistance to corrosion and fatigue for reduced maintenance requirements. In fact, Airbus calculates that the A350F will provide its customers around 65 more revenue days due to less maintenance downtime versus the proposed 777-8F over 16 years, thanks to the A350F’s clean-sheet advanced materials and well integrated systems. Moreover, these predictions are realistic given the proven track record of the A350-900 and -1000 in service today which are delivering more operational availability for extra revenue for operators. Indeed, the A350 platform has consistently demonstrated around 99.5% operational reliability in almost five million flight hours to date.

Superior combination of economics, payload flexibility, volume and range



On top of the low fuel consumption which already contributes to major savings, the A350F’s unbeatable economics are also built on the three tonnes additional structural payload (for a total of 109 tonnes) compared with the 777F. Moreover, to do the same job as its current competitor, the A350F will weigh around 28 tonnes less at take-off due to its much lighter composite fuselage & centre wing box, while burning around 20% less trip fuel. This also means that operators of Airbus’ new A350F freighter will benefit from lower landing and navigation charges.

As for the proposed 777-8F, while the current estimates suggests that it could offer six percent more volume and seven tonnes more payload than the A350F, this would come with a hefty burden of at least 32 additional metric tonnes (32,000kgs) of take-off weight (Airbus’ initial estimate) – which increases fuel burn, CO2 emissions and airport charges.

A key aspect of the A350F is that this payload can be more evenly distributed along the length of its fuselage floor. This is possible because the A350F’s floor beams are designed with the highest running-loads in the industry, which is available for most of the main-deck pallet positions. By contrast, in the 777F the maximum running-load over most of its cargo floor is some 45% less than the A350F (apart from in the centre section where the floor is stronger in all aircraft).



The A350F’s higher running-load capability over more of the floor will provide superior pallet loading flexibility and C-of-G management. In particular, its operators will be able to utilise the full 6.8 tonnes maximum certified limit for a 96x125 pallet for 20 of the 30 pallet positions, whereas the 777F only offers six pallet positions with a 6.8t pallet capability – with all the rest being limited to a maximum loading of only around four tonnes where the floor loading is more limited.

Mention should also be made of the A350F’s composite main-deck-cargo door (MDCD). With a clear opening measuring 3.72m by 3.16m, it allows loading on board of all new large turbofan engines. Meanwhile, the flexibility of the main-deck cargo-loading system (CLS) inside the aircraft provides for up to six positions for these engines to be directly latched, instead of using straps. The use of latches not only minimises turnaround time, but also frees-up space adjacently for two extra pallets.

Another key requirement when defining the A350F was the capability to fly from Hong Kong to Anchorage – an industry benchmark mission as it is the most often flown cargo route in the world – at full payload. Accordingly, the A350F with 109t max structural payload can carry it over 4,700nm to enable this route, and do so with the lowest possible fuel burn and proportionally reduced CO2 emissions.

Smooth integration into airlines’ fleets



The A350F brings a real edge when looking at fleet integration, thanks to the Airbus Commonality, which extends from training to the aircraft and engine maintenance. For example, existing A350 operators can use the same flight crews and ground technicians as they already do today for their current A350 operations. In addition, the A350 and A350F share commonality for engine and airframe spares and tooling, leading to minimum additional investment and maximum operational flexibility and profitability.

Regarding flight crew, the A350F benefits operators as it shares ‘Same Type Rating’ with the A350 and a ‘Common Type Rating’ with the A330 family. The result is that only eight days of flight training are needed for an A330 pilot to move towards an A350 aircraft, compared with 23 days for a non-Airbus pilot.

With over 900 A350s sold over the world, the family benefits from an outstanding Airbus support – which will seamlessly extend to the A350F once that enters service. The A350F will thus take advantage of this proven platform that has already demonstrated strong maturity and a reliable support network, carried by the same Airbus representatives.

The future-proof choice



Overall, the A350F is tailored to handle all future requirements for the large freighter segment – which Airbus forecasts will induct around 540 new aircraft for growth and replacement by 2040 to serve the general freight, express and e-commerce markets. For example, the A350F’s flexibility includes compatibility with the standard AMJ-type container in a side-by-side layout, which the express cargo companies use today. While for the general freight operators the aircraft also offers the right pallet cargo density of 9.5 pounds per cubic feet.

Moreover, with equal volume as the 747F, and three tonnes greater payload with 11% more volume than the 777F while offering more range, the A350F will deliver robust capabilities to ensure continuity for airline freight operations. In addition, it does all this while achieving 20% lower fuel and CO2 emissions than the current competitor, complying with all foreseeable environmental regulations.

Looking further ahead and further underscoring its ‘future-proof’ credentials, the A350F will also hold its efficiency advantage over any future fourth-generation derivative of the 777F such as the proposed 777-8F, notably thanks to the A350’s clean-sheet design with advanced materials that allow the Airbus aircraft to perform like-for-like missions with around 28 tonnes lighter take-off weight than the 777F and between 32 and 46 tonnes less weight than the 777-8F.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",positive,0.9999982118606567,1

Future Combat Air System: A400M clears the first hurdle as a Remote Carrier launcher - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAyLWZ1dHVyZS1jb21iYXQtYWlyLXN5c3RlbS1hNDAwbS1jbGVhcnMtdGhlLWZpcnN0LWh1cmRsZS1hcy1hLXJlbW90ZS1jYXJyaWVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A400M, the world’s most advanced multi-role airlifter utilised by military forces around the globe, has demonstrated an airborne launch of a drone fulfilling a vital function for the Future Combat Air System.

During a recent test, an A400M deployed a drone from its opened rear cargo ramp door whilst airborne, validating its ability to air-launch drones. In the future such unmanned aircraft, called Remote Carriers, can serve as force multipliers for various missions, while keeping the pilots out of harm’s way. Manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) will allow the Remote Carriers to operate in concert with manned aircraft, opening new fields of tactics to surprise, deceive, deter, saturate and strike opponents.

During the A400M flight test, an Airbus-built Do-DT25 drone, acting as a surrogate Remote Carrier, was released over a test range in Northern Germany. Shortly after the launch, the drone’s parachute opened, delivering it safely to the ground. Throughout the test, the drone was connected and transmitting data to the A400M “mother aircraft”. This data transfer illustrates how Remote Carriers can be connected to a combat cloud network, providing vital information by serving the role of “eyes and ears” over the battlefield, whilst also enabling them to be tasked by the manned aircraft’s operators during their missions.

Building up the expertise in manned-unmanned teaming

The A400M air-launch demonstration involved a joint flight test crew from the German Air Force and Airbus. The new Modular Airborne Combat Cloud Services (MACCS), also an Airbus product, enabled full connectivity between the airlifter and the drone.

Airbus will continue validation of the A400M as an airborne launch platform for Remote Carriers, envisioning the ability to deploy large numbers of these drones. The multi-role airlifter’s large cargo bay is expected to be able to hold 40 or more Remote Carriers. By bringing Remote Carriers closer to the fight, an A400M will provide the numbers in terms of flying platforms for a Future Combat System to serve multiple missions, even in a well-protected environment. The next flight test is planned to happen this year.

In addition, Airbus contribution to the 2021 German Air Force’s Timber Express exercise saw an important development step being cleared. A Eurofighter networking with and tasking two Do-DT25 drones in real-time, became the successful first application of MUM-T with operational military aircraft in Europe.

Previously, Airbus also demonstrated the control of five Do-DT25 drones by a mission group commander who was airborne in a manned command and control aircraft. Validating such elements, as connectivity, human-machine interface, and the concept of teaming intelligence through mission group management, also constitute key steps towards using Remote Carriers as force multipliers within the Future Combat Air System.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997572302818298}",neutral,0.9997572302818298,0

Asia-Pacific region will need over 17600 new aircraft by 2040 - Airbus,"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtcmVnaW9uLXdpbGwtbmVlZC1vdmVyLTE3NjAwLW5ldy1haXJjcmFmdC1ieS0yMDQw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Retirement of older aircraft to accelerate, demand progressively more driven by replacement, supporting the industry’s decarbonisation objectives

Air freight set to more than double in Asia-Pacific region by 2040

5.3% passenger traffic growth per year translating to a need for 17,620 passenger and freighter aircraft

Continued improvements in fleet efficiency, sustainable fuels, operations and propulsion technologies will enable the sector’s 2050 net-zero objective

Singapore, 14 February 2022 – In the next 20 year passenger traffic growth of 5.3% per annum and accelerated retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft will see the Asia-Pacific region require 17,620 new passenger and freighter aircraft. Nearly 30% of these will replace older less fuel efficient models.

In a region which is home to 55% of the world’s population, China, India and emerging economies such as Vietnam and Indonesia will be the principal drivers of growth in Asia-Pacific. GDP will grow at 3.6% per year compared to the world average 2.5% and double in value by 2040. The middle class, who are the likeliest to travel, will increase by 1.1 billion to 3.2 billion and the propensity for people to travel is set to almost triple by 2040.

Of the demand for 17,620 aircraft, 13,660 are in the Small category like the A220 and A320 Family. In the medium and long range categories, Asia-Pacific will continue to drive demand with some 42% of global requirement. This translates to 2,470 Medium and 1,490 Large category aircraft.

Cargo traffic in Asia-Pacific will also increase at 3.6% per annum, well above the global 3.1% average and will lead to a doubling in air freight in the region by 2040. Globally, express freight boosted by e-commerce will grow at an even faster pace of 4.7% per year. Overall, reflecting that strong growth over the next 20 years, there will be a need for some 2,440 freighters, of which 880 will be new-build.

“We are seeing a global recovery in air traffic and as travel restrictions are further eased the Asia-Pacific region will become one of its main drivers again. We are confident of a strong rebound in the region’s traffic and expect it to reach 2019 levels between 2023 and 2025,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “With an ever greater focus on efficiency and sustainable aviation in the region, our products are especially well positioned.”

“Our modern portfolio offers a 20-25 % fuel burn and therewith CO2 advantage over older generation aircraft and we pride ourselves that all our aircraft products are already certified to fly with a blend of 50% SAF, set to rise to 100% by 2030. In addition, our newly launched A350F offers efficiency gains of 10 to 40% compared to any other large freighter, existing or expected, both in terms of fuel consumption as in CO2 emissions. ”

Globally, in the next 20 years, there will be a need for some 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft, of which 15,250 will be for replacement. As a result, by 2040 the vast majority of commercial aircraft in operation will be the latest generation, up from some 13% today, considerably improving the CO2 efficiency of the world’s commercial aircraft fleets.

The global aviation industry has already achieved huge efficiency gains, as shown by the 53% decline in aviation’s CO2 emissions per revenue passenger kilometre since 1990. Airbus’ product range supports at least a 20% CO2 efficiency gain over previous-generation aircraft. In view of further ongoing innovations, product developments, operational improvements as well as market based options, Airbus has a clear ambition to achieve the air transport sector’s target to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The three partners intend to acquire 100% of Aubert & Duval through a new joint holding company that would be specifically set up for this transaction and in which they would have equal ownership rights.

Aubert & Duval is a strategic supplier of critical parts and materials for a number of demanding industry sectors, notably the aerospace, defence and nuclear industries, with annual revenues of approximately €500 million and a workforce of around 3,600 employees based mostly in France. The company has end-to-end capabilities in special materials and superalloys, as well as nascent expertise in titanium, which are critical to aerospace, transportation, energy and defence applications.

This acquisition would allow Airbus and Safran to secure the strategic supply chain, for themselves as well as other customers, and new material development for current and future civil and military aircraft and engine programmes. It is also consistent with the initiatives taken in the last few years to support the French aerospace industry’s supply chain, and in particular the creation, with the help of the French State, of the Ace Aéro Partenaires fund managed by Tikehau Ace Capital.

Olivier Andriès, Safran’s CEO, said: “Aubert & Duval is a historical supplier of Safran with unique technical expertise in Europe. The planned acquisition will ensure national sovereignty for our most strategic programmes for disruptive civil and military aircraft engines. Given its industrial expertise in metallurgy, Safran will lead the operational management of the company. The transformation programme will reinforce customer confidence and create a national champion with a strong French industrial base capable of serving global markets.”

“Aubert & Duval, with its critical knowledge and expertise dating back more than a century, is a strategic supplier to Airbus and the entire aerospace and defence industry. Our sector, which has started to emerge from the COVID crisis, needs a solid partner to ramp up production while preparing next-generation technologies in aerospace”, said Airbus’ CEO Guillaume Faury. “With this acquisition and an ambitious transformation plan, we aim to restore the operational excellence and market confidence in Aubert & Duval to create, in the mid- to long-term, a leading European player able to face global competition as well as to reduce geopolitical risk of supply.”

“This joint acquisition sends a strong and very encouraging message about the acceleration of the restructuring, the transformation and the consolidation of the supply chain in the aerospace industry”, added Marwan Lahoud, Executive Chairman of Tikehau Ace Capital. “Together with Airbus and Safran, by bringing the capital and top industrial expertise needed to leverage the strategic excellence of Aubert & Duval, we are proud to contribute to support the recovery of the sector at the most critical time, when aeronautical companies have to invest again to accompany the revival of activity and project themselves into the future.”

The proposed transaction is subject to consultation with relevant employee representative bodies and all necessary regulatory approvals. The closing is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.

In the context of this operation, a “specific share” was set up by the French State within Eramet with the scope of certain strategic assets held by Aubert & Duval. This specific share will be replaced by a similar one within Aubert & Duval, upon completion of the transaction.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9882988929748535}",positive,0.9882988929748535,1

Reality is just as exciting, as Airbus has pioneered electric propulsion systems that continue to open new horizons for satellites and deep space probes.

Airbus introduced electric propulsion in space during the early 2000s, with its use for the “station keeping” of telecommunications satellites – maintaining these relay platforms in their proper orbital positions as they circle the Earth.

The company has continuously evolved the technology during the past 20 years, with a breakthrough in 2017 when the fully-electric Eutelsat 172B telecom spacecraft was launched. Eutelsat 172B’s innovative fully-electric propulsion system enabled a 40% savings in the satellite’s mass at lift-off, enabling more relay capacity to be carried aboard for enhanced communications services. Additionally, this spacecraft took a record-breaking fast track to orbit while consuming six times less propellant than a satellite with traditional chemical propulsion.

Opening the outer limits

Today, this technology is opening the boundaries even further by helping humankind investigate mysteries of the Solar System, like Europe’s BepiColombo probe, currently en route to the planet Mercury powered by an electric propulsion system. Without it, BepiColombo could have been a much larger spacecraft – and with the size and weight of spacecraft key factors in enabling launch, this could have been a show-stopper in sending this long-distance voyager to the smallest and least explored rocky planet in our space neighbourhood.

MSR ERO

Airbus is now developing an all-electric system for the ambitious international Mars Sample Return Mission that will bring back the first ever rock samples from Mars. This electric propulsion system, three times more powerful than that used on the Mercury mission, will propel the Earth Return Orbiter spacecraft to reach the Red Planet, and then power it back home with its precious cargo collected from the Martian surface.

Looking to the next frontiers, electric propulsion will continue as a key enabler in space, because at Airbus, we’re for what’s next.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9977204203605652}",positive,0.9977204203605652,1

February 16, 2022, © Leeham News: Airbus presented its results for 2022 today. The company announced net profits of €4.3bn on revenue of €58.8bn despite several disruptive events during 2022.

Disruptions like the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war and the supply chain ramp after COVID kept the delivery increase for 2022 at half the target of 110 jets, resulting in 661 deliveries instead of the originally guided 720.

Guidance for 2023 keeps the 720 airliner delivery target, an operating profit of €6bn, and a Free Cash Flow of €3bn.

Group-level results

Revenue for 2022 was €58.8bn (€52.1bn 2021), operating profit €5.6bn (called EBIT adjusted, +€4.3bn 2021), and net profit was €4.3bn (+€4.2bn). The results include a net €0.3bn write-off due to mainly A400M contract price adjustment losses. Airbus announced it would pay €1.80 dividend to its shairholders.

Free cash flow for 2022 was €4.7bn (€3.6bn), and the net cash position at the end of 2022 was €9.4bn (2020 €7.6bn).

Guidance for 2023 is:

On condition of no additional disruptions of the world economy:

Airbus targets ~720 commercial aircraft deliveries for 2022.

Airbus expects an EBIT Adjusted of ~€6bn

Free Cash Flow of ~€3bn.

Commercial aircraft

The division had 820 net orders during 2022 (507), with a backlog now at 7,239 (7,082) aircraft.

Of the 664 (611) deliveries during 2022, 516 (483) were A320/A321, 53 (50) A220, 60 (55) A350, 32 (18) A330.

The A320 series is now sold out until 2029. The ramp to 65 per month is planned for the end of 2024, and 75 is delayed to 2026 from 2025. In the early part of 2022, the supply issue was engines, but once this eased, the supply of many parts hit bottlenecks because of chip shortages and special material shortages.

The rumored internal disruptions were the struggle with constant replanning and improvisation from Airbus’ side, trying to handle the situation more than any systemic issues, according to CEO Guillame Faury.

Widebody demand has come back faster than expected. There are no delays in the delivery of widebodies, but the production rate of the A350 is now raised to nine per month by the end of 2025 (at six right now).

The A330neo also sees increased demand. The present rate of 3/month is raised to four in 2024.

Helicopters

Helicopters had a solid year. Revenue increased to €7.0bn, Figure 2, (€6.5bn) and EBIT to €0.64bn (€0.54bn). The product program is under renewal, Figure 2, with several countries certifying the new H160.

Defense and Space

Defense and Space had q troubled year with delays of the Ariane 6 launcher and the failure of two Pleiades satellites. The problems with Russia meant the Souyz launchers were no longer available. It leaves Europe without access to space for 2023, and this is a wake-up call, according to Faury. European cooperation must be reinforced after a period of national interests. On the positive side was the agreement of Phase 1B of the FCAS fighter program with Daussault and the contract for the Eurodrone.

Revenues were €10.3bn (€10.2bn), with EBIT at -€0.12bn (€0.38bn).

10 (8) A440Ms were delivered in 2021. The losses of €0.5bn for the program were a result of a contract that does not compensate adequately for inflation effects.

Airbus CEO says hydrogen plane is 'the ultimate solution' but cautions a lot of work lies ahead - CNBC,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWNlby1zYXlzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW5lLWlzLXRoZS11bHRpbWF0ZS1zb2x1dGlvbi5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDIvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWNlby1zYXlzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW5lLWlzLXRoZS11bHRpbWF0ZS1zb2x1dGlvbi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation could face substantial challenges if it's unable to decarbonize in a timely manner, according to the CEO of Airbus , who added that hydrogen planes represent the ""ultimate solution"" for the mid and long term.



In an interview with CNBC's Rosanna Lockwood on Thursday, Guillaume Faury — who was speaking after his firm reported earnings earlier in the day — said aviation would ""potentially face significant hurdles if we don't manage to decarbonize at the right pace.""

The environmental footprint of aviation is significant, with the World Wildlife Fund describing it as ""one of the fastest-growing sources of the greenhouse gas emissions driving global climate change."" The WWF also says air travel is ""currently the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make.""

Faury laid out a number of areas Airbus was focusing on. These included ensuring planes burned less fuel and emitted less carbon dioxide. In addition, the aircraft the firm was delivering now had a certified capacity for 50% sustainable aviation fuel in their tanks.

""We need to see the SAF industry moving forwards, being developed, being grown to serve airlines and to be able to use that capacity of 50% of SAF,"" he said, referring to the sustainable aviation fuel industry. ""We'll go to 100% by the end of the decade.""

The above represented a ""very important part of what we're doing"" Faury said. ""The next one is looking at the mid-term and long-term future to bring to the market the hydrogen plane because this is really the ultimate solution,"" he said, noting that a lot of engineering, research and capital commitments would be required.

In Sept. 2020, Airbus released details of three ""hybrid-hydrogen"" concept planes, saying they could enter service by the year 2035. The same month saw a hydrogen fuel-cell plane capable of carrying passengers complete its maiden flight.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.880579948425293}",negative,0.880579948425293,-1

Airbus and OCCAR sign Eurodrone contract - Airbus,"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1haXJidXMtYW5kLW9jY2FyLXNpZ24tZXVyb2Ryb25lLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Manching, 24 February 2022 – Airbus and the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) have signed the Eurodrone global contract, which includes the development and manufacturing of 20 systems and 5 years of initial in-service support. Industry prime Airbus Defence and Space GmbH signed in representation of the three Major Sub-Contractors (MSC) Airbus Defence and Space S.A.U in Spain, Dassault Aviation in France and Leonardo S.p.A. in Italy, while OCCAR has signed on behalf of the four launch nations Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

“This signature kicks-off the development of one of the most ambitious European defence programmes. Eurodrone is the result of collaborative work between the industry, OCCAR and the nations. It will deliver the most advance Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) in its segment, generate more than 7,000 high-tech jobs within the industry and will strengthen European industrial sovereignty, know-how and collaboration between nations”, said Mike Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

“This contract marks the determination of the European nations and industrial partners to achieve the political goals and to meet the technological challenges leading to European defense sovereignty. Innovative programmes with strong key technological foundations will guarantee the strategic autonomy of Europe by offering new alternatives to the on-the-shelf acquisition of non-European products. Thanks to a shared vision and a pragmatic approach, Eurodrone is carried by the choice of best in-house competencies and expertise of each company”, declared Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation.

“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone for the european nations which confirms the determination and achievements of the Industrial Partners in meeting the challenges that accompany the development of a complex and strategic European Defence and Security Programme. Eurodrone will provide high performance and sovereign operational systems to the armed forces and represents a key constituent of the European Defence Industry as well as a unique opportunity to showcase our high technological expertise and capabilities stemming from decades of European collaboration on military programmes. Eurodrone will contribute to sustaining key competencies and jobs within Europe, providing armed forces with top performance and independent operational systems for years to come”, said Lucio Valerio Cioffi, General Manager of Leonardo.

Eurodrone is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) with versatile and adaptable capabilities that make it the perfect platform for Intelligence, Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions or homeland security operations. Its opened architecture part of the future-proof design will allow for growth and rescoping system capabilities as may be required by the future needs of customer armed forces.

It is the first MALE designed from the start to meet requirements for integration into civil airspace, helping to improve efficiencies such as use of direct flight paths, without the need for pre-planned emergency landing sites, which saves time, fuel and, as a result, CO2 emissions.

Eurodrone relies on Digital Design, Manufacturing and Services (DDMS), a new, digital-first approach applied by Airbus to the way aerospace products are designed, manufactured and operated throughout all product phases. Eurodrone is the first programme that will be fully designed and developed from the start through DDMS in a stepped approach and aims to benefit from better upgrade planning, improved operational availability and lower life-cycle costs.

The Hydrogen Stream: Airbus plans flight test with direct combustion engine fueled by hydrogen - pv magazine International,"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdi1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNS90aGUtaHlkcm9nZW4tc3RyZWFtLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFucy1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdC13aXRoLWRpcmVjdC1jb21idXN0aW9uLWVuZ2luZS1mdWVsZWQtYnktaHlkcm9nZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft company Airbus has officially launched its multi-year demonstrator program to test a variety of hydrogen technologies on the ground and in the air. “Today, the A380 MSN1 test aircraft is earmarked for a new role: to take the lead on testing the technologies that will be vital to bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035,” wrote Airbus this week. The ZEROe demonstrator will carry four liquid hydrogen tanks in a caudal position, as well as a hydrogen combustion engine mounted along the rear fuselage. The liquid hydrogen distribution system will feed into a conditioning system in which the liquid hydrogen will transform into its gaseous form before it is introduced into the engine where it is combusted for propulsion.

A research team led by the China University of Geosciences designed ultrafine Pd100-xCux alloy nanodot-modified TiO2 photocatalysts via the NaH2PO2-mediated co-deposition route to keep high photocatalytic performance, while replacing platinum (Pt) with palladium as the cocatalyst. “The obtained Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots (2-5 nm) are uniformly dispersed onto TiO2 and their componential ratios can be well controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of Cu and Pd precursor. Based on in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) results, the as-formed Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated charges and weaken the adsorption strength for hydrogen to optimize the process of hydrogen-desorption process on Pd75Cu25 alloy, thus leading to high photocatalytic H2-evolution activity,” the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics wrote on Tuesday.

The US states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to coordinate and develop a regional clean hydrogen hub. The signatory states will work together in developing the Western Inter-State Hydrogen Hub (WISHH) with supporting facilities in each state. “Each state commits that this is the only proposal(s) that they will participate in for a hydrogen hub, and that they will not submit to the DOE [Department of Energy] their own standalone proposal or a proposal in cooperation with other states or entities other than the signatories of this MOU,” reads the document published on Wednesday. Upon agreement of all four Rocky Mountain states, additional western states may be added to the group.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has presented its plans to establish the Takasago Hydrogen Park, calling it the world’s first center for validation of hydrogen-related technologies, from hydrogen production to power generation. The center will support the commercialization of hydrogen gas turbines using hydrogen as fuel. The first part of the plan, which includes demonstrating operations of hydrogen production, storage, and hydrogen fueling of gas turbines, should commence operations in the fiscal year 2023. “The Takasago Hydrogen Park will be successively expanded and developed going forward. Mitsubishi Power has announced it will use Takasago Hydrogen Park to commercialize small and large frame gas turbines on a path to 100% hydrogen firing starting in 2025,” the Japanese company wrote on Tuesday.

Vertex Hydrogen, the joint venture between UK-focused downstream energy company Essar Oil UK and UK-based clean energy projects developer Progressive Energy, has unveiled a report detailing the development of the UK’s first-ever large-scale low carbon hydrogen production plant. “The hub will produce 1GW of low carbon hydrogen with the first production line starting in the mid 2020s,” Vertex Hydrogen wrote in a statement. Hydrogen is expected to replace fossil fuels in the industry in North West England and North Wales. The plant will sit at the heart of the HyNet low carbon cluster, the UK’s leading industrial decarbonization hub.

Genoa-based classification society RINA has announced the Approval in Principle (AiP) of Swedish designer FKAB Marine Design’s hydrogen-powered MR Tanker, saying it is “the first AiP of a design using currently viable technology and fuels that achieves IMO 2050 targets.” Conceived by the class society and designed by FKAB, the propulsion is based on combining the ship’s fuel (LNG) with steam to produce hydrogen and CO2. “The MR LNG/hydrogen-fuelled vessel is the result of a joint project with ABB and Helbio (a subsidiary of Metacon AB),” wrote Rina last week. The classification society explained that the design allows ships to meet full decarbonization targets by either running the engine on 100% hydrogen or by producing all the power needed by fuel cells. “In this way, the owner can decide the rate of CO2 reduction.” No additional bunkering, aside from normal LNG, is required. The hydrogen produced can be used to power the main engine, or fuel cells, or a hybrid of the two. Meanwhile, the classification society Korea Register has signed a memorandum of understanding with STX Energy Solutions and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering to work together to standardize and commercialize solid oxide fuel cells. “The agreement was signed to facilitate the development of a future power generation system through the sharing and application of technology and research resources to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) increasingly rigorous environmental regulations,” Korea Register wrote on Thursday. A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) produces electricity through the electrochemical reaction of oxygen and hydrocarbons from oxidizing LNG. In other words: competing technologies are nearing a similar stage. Most of them, however, will focus on LNG-related shipping solutions.

Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) encouraged hydrogen usage to accelerate the energy transition in the country. The message was conveyed directly by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif on the sidelines of a bilateral meeting on Monday with the Republic of Korea's minister of trade, industry and energy, Moon Sung Wook, in Jakarta. “The main strategy to be carried out towards carbon neutrality on the supply side is through the development of massive renewable energy, with a focus on solar, hydro and geothermal power plants as well as hydrogen,” said Arifin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999237060546875}",neutral,0.9999237060546875,0
The Airbus A318 Eludes Me Yet Again - Live and Let's Fly,"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzE4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For years I’ve been trying to fly on the Airbus A318 and for years I have failed. Once it was due to a flight cancellation. Once due a schedule change. This time it was due to a last-minute equipment swap.

Airbus A318 Continues To Evade Me, This Time On Air France

In reviving my options to get from Amsterdam to Tunis, I chose Air France, which required an overnight in Paris before a 7:00am connection to Tunis. While that was flight was set in stone, I had six flights to choose from to get from Amsterdam (AMS) to Paris (CDG).

While I always love KLM and would have enjoyed flying the Dutch airline again, even on a short flight, I chose Air France because its 1:55pm flight was operated by an Airbus A318, the only Airbus A320 family aircraft I have never flown.

It’s a mini version of the A320 and never did particularly well, but Air France continues to operate the aircraft (so does SkyTeam partner Tarom). I’d like to fly the aircraft before it is retired (and with new Airbus A220s in the Air France fleet, I’m not sure it will be all that long) and scheduled the Air France flight just to try the aircraft.

But as I approached the gate to board, I noticed my “A318” looked a bit too big. Indeed, I pulled up my flight on FlightAware and found that my A318 had been swapped for an A319, an aircraft I fly on all the time.

Although greatly dismayed, the later Air France flight was operated by an A321 and KLM uses 737s on the route, so it made no sense to try to switch. Ironically, the day before and day after my flight it was operated, as scheduled, by an A318.

Onboard, I found my seat in row one and at least expected a nice lunch after takeoff. In European business class, you only get an economy class seat with a middle seat blocked, but can generally expect a decent meal onboard, particularly on a mainline aircraft.

But nope, apparently Air France is still engaged in some degree of COVID-19 cost-cutting because instead of being served a small cold meal, I was offered a small package of cheese biscuits and a small packet of chocolate orange candy.

Pretty disappointing considering KLM would have at least served a little box of food and Lufthansa and British Airways would have offered a much heartier meal.

CONCLUSION

Air France disappointed me by swapping out the A318 on my flight to Paris then failing to serve a meal onboard. While the A318 vs. A319 issue is meaningless to most passengers, do keep in mind that if you pay up for business class on Air France, you won’t fed on a key hub-to-hub flight.

Qatar hits out at Airbus as new jet grounded in paint dispute - Tech Xplore,"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAyLXFhdGFyLWFpcmJ1cy1qZXQtZ3JvdW5kZWQtZGlzcHV0ZS5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItMDItcWF0YXItYWlyYnVzLWpldC1ncm91bmRlZC1kaXNwdXRlLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People watch as an Airbus A350 aircraft flies past at the Singapore Airshow on February 16, 2022.

Qatar Airways on Monday accused aviation giant Airbus of blocking efforts to settle their billion-dollar dispute over the safety of the A350 as it announced that another plane has been grounded with peeling paintwork.

The airline, which has now grounded 22 of its 53 A350 jets since November 2020, said it was determined to plough ahead with legal action seeking $610 million in compensation plus damages for each day the conflict goes on.

While they fight in the London courts, Airbus has in turn sought to cancel orders made by Qatar Airways for two other A350 jets and 50 A321neo planes.

The airline said it was surprised that Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury, announcing record profits, had said earlier in February that while protecting itself in court ""we continue to try to resolve the situation in a more amicable way"".

""It is important to clarify that neither Qatar Airways nor its legal team are aware of any efforts by Airbus to try to resolve the situation in an amicable way; in fact, the actual situation is to the contrary,"" the airline responded in a statement.

It highlighted what it called Airbus ""efforts to attempt to terminate their own contractual commitment to establish a full root cause analysis of the A350 Accelerated Surface Degradation which is currently impacting the A350 aircraft type"".

The airline vowed to continue its legal battle to make Airbus ""fully, properly and transparently investigate"" the paint problems on the jets that it says could be a threat to the plane's lightning protection.

Airbus insists it has accounted for the problems and there is no safety concern.

Ahead of the next hearing on the dispute in April, Qatar Airways has secured an injunction preventing Airbus from cancelling deals for other jets.

""There would be serious consequences for Airbus should this order be breached,"" said the Qatar Airways statement.

The problems first arose in November 2020 when a jet was taken to Shannon airport in Ireland to be painted in special colours for the World Cup to be held in Qatar this year.

Qatar Airways has suffered huge losses during the coronavirus pandemic while after two years of losses, Airbus announced profits of 4.2 billion euros ($4.8 billion) for 2021 and said it expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft this year.

Airbus to support Philippine Airlines' traffic ramp up with cabin upgrades and new material services - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL2FpcmNyYWZ0LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1haXJidXMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1waGlsaXBwaW5lLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRyYWZmaWMtcmFtcC11cC13aXRoLWNhYmluLWFuLW5ldy1tYXRlcmlhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1jb250cmFjdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 17 February 2022

Philippine Airlines (PAL) has selected Airbus to perform cabin modification for 15 aircraft and expand the material services programme for the airline’s Airbus fleet.

The cabin modification agreement covers 11 A320, two A330-300s and two A350-900s.

When completed, PAL’s A320s will have 24 extra seats to bring the total seat count to 180, a configuration that suits the airline’s requirements for short-haul inter-island domestic routes. The two A330s will gain an additional 50 seats to bring the total seat count to 359 for better airlift capability on key higher-density regional routes and repatriation flights. The A350s will gain another 18 seats for a total of 313 seats, which still preserves the roomy cabin layout and passenger-friendly experience that PAL Business Class and Economy Class travellers enjoy on the A350’s long-haul routes.

PAL has contracted Airbus to provide the relevant Service Bulletins and kits required for the cabin modification programme, which comes as part of the carrier’s fleet restructuring plans.

“Philippine Airlines believes that, as we exit the pandemic, our fleet restructuring strategy helps us to better adapt to changing market situations and ensure that we are well-positioned for recovery,” said Nilo Thaddeus Rodriguez, PAL Chief Financial Officer. “Our aircraft deployment decisions and related technical support arrangements are tailored for a restructured network that suits a vastly different global environment.”

“We chose Airbus with the firm expectation that PAL will receive high quality Service Bulletins and timely updates to technical documentation, along with the highly regarded extensive engineering support we expect from a leading aircraft manufacturer,” said Alvin Kendrich Limqueco, PAL Senior Vice President- Supply Chain Management.

In addition, PAL is extending its ‘Flight Hour Services’ (FHS) material programme with Airbus to cover more of its fleet, with guaranteed parts availability to secure the operational reliability and efficiency of PAL’s widebody and narrowbody aircraft.

The FHS programme, which currently covers two A350s, now includes 37 more aircraft, comprising 29 A321 Family (including eight A321neos) and eight A330ceos. Airbus will provide components standard exchange, components repairs, component reliability and engineering services, as well as on-site stock at PAL’s main base in Manila.

“Airbus has its customers’ interests at heart and works closely with them to propose flexible material solutions that meet their needs. We are pleased that PAL recognises the significant savings and operational performance which Airbus can bring with FHS, extending the current arrangement to their A330 and A321 Family fleets,” Anand Stanley, President Airbus Asia-Pacific.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7184561491012573}",neutral,0.7184561491012573,0

Airbus readies hydrogen-powered demo flights - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 08 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wOC9haXJidXMtcmVhZGllcy1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWRlbW8tZmxpZ2h0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update, Feb. 21: Airbus announced today a press conference tomorrow in Toulouse.

By Scott Hamilton

Feb. 8, 2022, (c) Leeham News: Airbus plans to fly a hydrogen-fueled ZEROe demonstrator soon, with an announcement coming as early as this month.

Airbus’ drive to reduce emissions appears prioritized toward developing an H2-fueled airplane. While all it’s A-Series aircraft will be 100% compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030—they’re 50% compatible today—hydrogen is at the forefront of its research and development. Officials want to have an H2-powered airplane ready for service by 2035. This aircraft will almost certainly be a turboprop.

Amanda Simpson, vice president for research and technology of Airbus, said the company must have a demonstration project proving the feasibility of an H2-fueled airplane before full development can proceed. She told the audience at the annual conference of the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance yesterday that an announcement could come within two weeks. In sideline remarks, she declined to say what type of aircraft will be used for the demo project.

Nothing more to add

An Airbus spokesman said separately, “We’re working toward demonstration programs to mature a number of different technologies related to hydrogen-powered concepts, but we don’t have anything more specific that that to share at the moment. We may have some interesting projects to talk about later this year, though.”

During her presentation, Simpson outlined several jet concepts that could use hydrogen fuel. A turboprop concept also has been previously shown. Simpson said that H2-powered flights previously were undertaken by the US Air Force and a Soviet airliner, some dating to 1957.

The European aircraft giant said Tuesday that it's working with engine maker CFM International — a joint venture of General Electric 's aviation arm and France's Safran — on the test plane, which will include a modified version of an engine already in use that will have to handle higher temperatures at which hydrogen burns. Test flights could begin 2026, Airbus said.

Aircraft manufacturers and airlines are scrambling to slash their carbon emissions, which account for more than 2% of the world's total. Airbus has aggressively pursued hydrogen and said it is working on a passenger aircraft powered by the fuel that it expects will enter service in 2035.

Rival Boeing has focused on more sustainable aviation fuels, which currently make up less than 1% of the jet fuel supply and are more expensive than conventional jet fuel. CEO Dave Calhoun said at an investor conference last June that he didn't expect a hydrogen-powered plane on ""the scale of airplanes that we're referring to"" before 2050.

""It will work for some very small packages,"" he said.

One big challenge in using hydrogen fuel is that storing it would require additional equipment that adds weight to the aircraft, reducing the number of people or amount of cargo that a plane could carry, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at Aerodynamic Advisory, an aviation consulting firm.

""Hydrogen is what happens when engineers and economists don't talk to each other,"" he said.

Airbus said it selected its A380, the world's largest passenger plane, because it had room to store the liquid hydrogen tanks and other equipment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998288154602051}",neutral,0.9998288154602051,0

The order was signed at the Singapore Airshow by SIA CEO Goh Choong Phong, and Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International Christian Scherer.

The order firms up the carrier's commitment to the new generation freighter announced by the plane maker in December 2021. The newly ordered aircraft will replace the carrier’s existing 747-400F fleet from the fourth quarter of 2025.

“This order underscores the importance of the cargo market to the SIA Group. The introduction of the A350F will enhance our capabilities in this key sector, ensuring that we are ready for the growth opportunities that will arise in the coming years. These new-generation aircraft will substantially increase our operating efficiencies and reduce our fuel burn, making an important contribution towards the success of our long-term decarbonisation goals,” said Goh Choon Phong, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Airlines.

“Singapore Airlines is the world's largest operator of the A350 and is now set to become the first to fly the all-new freighter variant,” said Christian Scherer. “The A350F will fit seamlessly into the carrier's existing fleet, while redefining the operational efficiency of its cargo operations, bringing a 40% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions compared with the aircraft it will replace at SIA, while offering the same payload-carrying capacity and longer range. Consumer patterns have changed dramatically in recent times, generating increased demand for the swift transport of cargo by air. With the A350F, SIA will be well-positioned to respond to this enormous market potential in a profitable and sustainable way.”

The A350F meets the imminent wave of large freighter replacements and the evolving environmental requirements, shaping the future of air freight. The A350F will be powered by the latest technology, fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The A350F is based on the world’s most modern long-range passenger family. With a 109- tonne payload capability, the A350F will serve all cargo markets. The aircraft features a large main deck cargo door, with its fuselage length and capacity optimised around the industry’s standard pallets and containers.

More than 70% of the airframe will be made of advanced materials, resulting in a 30tonne lighter take-off weight and generating at least 20% lower fuel consumption and emissions over its current closest competitor. The A350F will fully meet ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards coming into effect in 2027.

Singapore Airlines is the world’s largest operator of the A350, with 58 currently in service.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999026894569397}",positive,0.999026894569397,1
Airbus Reveals Refined ZEROe Blended Wing Body Concept - Aviation Week,"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlyc2hvdy9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1yZWZpbmVkLXplcm9lLWJsZW5kZWQtd2luZy1ib2R5LWNvbmNlcHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE—As Airbus closes in on a decision about which technologies to pursue for its next-generation carbon-neutral airliner plan, the manufacturer has provided more details about the zero-emissions “ZEROe” blended wing body concept first revealed at the Singapore Airshow in 2020.

The blended wing body (BWB) was one of three potential hydrogen-fueled ZEROe concepts outlined later that year when the OEM unveiled ambitious plans to develop the world’s first zero-emissions commercial aircraft for entry into service (EIS) by 2035. The other study concepts—a turboprop and a turbofan-powered airliner—are based on more conventional tube-and-wing configurations.

While all three depend on hydrogen as the primary power source, the different concepts are intended to explore various propulsion, aerodynamic and structural approaches to achieve the zero-emissions midterm EIS target. The 120-200-seat turbofan is configured with hydrogen-burning gas turbines, while the turboprop—seating up to 100 passengers—also is equipped with engines modified to directly combust liquid hydrogen.

The BWB displayed on the Airbus stand at this week's 2022 Singapore Airshow is closer to the original twin-engine configuration shown at Singapore 2020 than the subsequent version unveiled as part of the ZEROe announcement later that year in September. The initial version, which was based on a configuration tested in 2019 on a scaled flight demonstrator under the Maveric (Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls) program, featured twin podded engines and integrated vertical tails.

The Maveric, which was 6.5 ft. long with a 10.5-ft. wingspan, was designed specifically to evaluate flight control systems adapted for delta wing designs. However, the program later evaluated wider aspects of the BWB configuration including safety, manufacturability, airport compatibility, maintenance and support.

In September 2020 Airbus subsequently revealed an updated BWB configuration for the ZEROe project in which the two integrated turbofan and tails were replaced with a distributed hybrid-electric propulsion system along the trailing edge. However, the latest design combines the larger-scale realism of the ZEROe BWB with a refinement of the twin-podded engine arrangement first seen on the Maveric-based model seen two years ago.

The evolved design shows a longer, wider overall cabin with multiple side windows and access doors in the forward fuselage as well as extended variants of the sharklet blended wingtips similar to those used on the Airbus A350. The twin vertical tails are taller than those seen on the earlier configuration and are closely integrated with the nacelles. The increase in height, added to greater fin sweep on the updated design, might reflect the requirement for increased control authority in a design with a short moment arm.

The engine inlets are scarfed to reduce noise radiation, as are the nozzles. The engines are positioned further aft than the earlier designs and the reconfigured nacelle is likely needed to provide greater downward and sideward noise shielding. Closely integrated with the upper deck and faired into recessed channels, the inlets may also incorporate active flow control to enable ingestion of the boundary layer while reducing inlet distortion.

Of the three study configurations, Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says: “The BWB is probably the most innovative and most futuristic, especially if you are looking to the use of hydrogen, because it has more storage area. However, looking to 2035, I would doubt that this might be the first configuration we will have in the market, so we are looking at more classical configurations. We haven’t made the choice yet, but probably it’s going to be one of the more classical ones which will be first.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

The company released its full year 2021 financial results on Thursday.

Revenues for Airbus Defence and Space were down 2% in 2021 compared to 2020, due to the Military Aircraft business, partially offset by Space Systems. The segment reported 10.2 billion euro ($11.6 billion) in revenue in 2021, compared to $10.4 billion euro in 2020.

Defence and Space order intake for the year was 13.7 billion ($15.6 billion) in 2021, up 15% from the year prior. Total orders stand at 36.1 billion euro ($41 billion). This includes orders in the Military Aircraft business such as the in-service support of the German and Spanish Eurofighter fleets and export momentum for the C295, A330 MRTT and A400M airlifter. This compares to the 39% YoY increase in net order intake the Defence and Space segment reported in 2020.

Airbus overall saw a large increase in order intake during 2021, with overall order intake up 86%. The company reported consolidated revenues of 52.1 billion ($59.2 billion) in 2021, an increase of 4% over 2020. The revenue increase was driven by commercial aircraft deliveries. Net income was 4.2 billion euros ($4.8 billion).

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the company shifted from navigating the pandemic in 2021 toward recovery and growth.

“The strong financials reflect the higher number of commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance of our Helicopters and Defence and Space businesses as well as our efforts on cost containment and competitiveness. Record net income and our efforts to strengthen the net cash position underpin our proposal to reintroduce dividend payments going forward,” Faury said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Airbus sees growth opportunities - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjAyLzE5L1dTNjIwZjU2MWVhMzEwY2RkMzliYzg3OGY4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A320neo aircraft in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, Oct 17, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it has strong confidence in the growth opportunities in China. Hence, the company has made fresh investments in the country at a time when it canceled some projects elsewhere, said George Xu, executive vice-president of Airbus and CEO of Airbus China.

Confidence in the China market remains high despite COVID challenges and the company's plan to cut costs, he said.

Airbus attaches great importance to the company's digitalization and green transformation. This year, some aircraft delivered from Airbus' final assembly line in Tianjin will use sustainable aviation fuel, Xu said.

Airbus said it expects to deliver the 600th A320 family aircraft assembled in Tianjin, and expand the facility's capability to A321 production in the second half of this year. The A321, the biggest member of the A320 family, now serves as Airbus' single-aisle aircraft with the strongest demand globally, the European aircraft maker said.

Meanwhile, the air cargo transportation market has become a bright spot for the industry amid the pandemic. The world's largest plane maker in terms of the volume of annual delivery said it plans to deliver its first A350 freighter in 2025. It has received multiple orders, including the most recent ones like intended orders from Etihad Airways and orders for seven A350 freighters from Singapore Airlines.

""With the continuous rise in volumes of international trade and the booming growth of e-commerce business, the market for freighters shows rosy prospects. We are in discussions with a number of domestic and international carriers and logistics companies about our latest freighter,"" Xu said.

""Since the pandemic, competition among airlines has become fiercer, and they need better products and services to raise efficiency and reliability and lower costs. Airbus has developed a relatively sound industrial chain in China. Our success has benefited from close cooperation with local partners, and we are still exploring new cooperation opportunities with Chinese aviation industry players.""

In addition, China has shown a strong demand for freighters converted from the A330 passenger aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer said it has more than 230 A330s operating in China, and some aging aircraft are expected to become A330-renovated freighters. Many of them will be converted in China, given the attractive conversion costs and advanced technologies available in the country.

In the past decade, Airbus' continued investment in China has helped lift its market share in the country to about 53 percent and steal a march over its US rival Boeing Co.

""The increase in the delivery capability of Airbus' final assembly line in Tianjin shows the attractiveness of the China market for Airbus and the company regards Tianjin as an important facility,"" said Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China.

Last year, Airbus delivered 142 commercial aircraft to Chinese carriers, up more than 40 percent year-on-year. It accounted for 23 percent of the company's total globally.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 commercial aircraft globally, up 8 percent year-on-year. This year, Airbus aims to deliver 720 aircraft to its global customers.

Specifically on the A320 family of aircraft, the ramp-up is on track to achieve monthly production rate of 65 by the summer of 2023. By then, the rate will be higher than the level seen before the pandemic.

China will have continued high demand for single-aisle planes and will need about 6,900 single-aisle aircraft by 2040, Airbus forecast.

Meanwhile, the Boeing 737 Max is expected to begin flights in China again soon after being grounded for more than two years following two fatal crashes. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft model in December.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

The company now aims to ramp up production.

Airbus reported a record €4.2 billion ($4.8 billion) profit in 2021 despite the coronavirus pandemic.

The high earnings were due to the higher number of aircraft deliveries, good performance of the company's helicopter, defense and space subdivisions, as well as cost-cutting measures, said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury on Thursday.

Last year ""was a year of transition, where our attention shifted from navigating the pandemic towards recovery and growth,"" he said.

""Thanks to the resilience and efforts of our teams, customers and suppliers, we delivered remarkable full-year results.""

Why had Airbus previously posted huge losses?

The 2021 earnings mark a strong comeback for the European airplane producer, which reported losses of €1.36 billion in 2019 and €1.1 billion in 2020.

The 2019 loses were due to the company paying out billions in fines over bribery investigations in the US, the UK, and France. Then, 2020 brought unprecedented disruption to the airplane industry as the coronavirus halted travel across the world. Airbus responded to the pandemic by cutting around 10,000 jobs.

The company delivered 611 commercial aircraft in 2021, compared to 566 the year before.

What future plans does Airbus have?

On Thursday, Airbus said it was ramping up production and hoping to reach 720 deliveries in 2022.

It also stated an aim to recruit around 6,000 workers this year. This ""assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the company's internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services,"" according to a statement.

Airbus shareholders will now be offered dividends of €1.50 per share, the company said.

Airbus assembling Racer; targets flight this year - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWFzc2VtYmxpbmctcmFjZXItdGFyZ2V0cy1mbGlnaHQtdGhpcy15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Construction of the Airbus Racer high-speed compound aircraft is accelerating at the manufacturer’s facility in Marignane, France, as the program teams targets a first flight by the end of the year.

The high-speed demonstrator will be optimized for a cruise speed of more than 400 km/h (215 knots). Airbus Image

The demonstrator aims to build on the legacy of the Airbus X3, which logged a top speed of 255 knots on June 7, 2013. Airbus hopes to use the Racer to demonstrate the utility of such high-speed vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) flight in various mission scenarios, with a target cruise speed of 215 knots. It takes the very basic design element — two propellers mounted on short wings — from its predecessor, but a slight family resemblance is all that is common between the two aircraft.

The Racer is a clean sheet design, developed under the frame of the European Clean Sky 2 project, involving 42 suppliers from 13 countries.

Almost all the major components from these suppliers have now arrived for final assembly of the aircraft in Marignane, with the main gearbox being the major outstanding item. Italian manufacturer Avio Aero is due to deliver it in June.

Recent additions to the airframe include the landing gear and box wings. Airbus Photo

During a media visit to the Racer assembly station, Brice Makinadjian, the aircraft’s chief engineer, said the team recently finalized the installation of the fuel system and the landing gear (three sets of retractable wheels — one under each wing, and another under the cockpit).

“It’s not just that we receive and we mount [the systems]; we receive [them], we make the quality of inspection, we make the feed check, we prepare all the installation, and then we install and we validate the quality of the installation,” he said. “It’s a whole process — and for such equipment that is very critical. It is a very good step toward the first flight.”

Assembly of the aircraft’s lateral gearboxes is due to be complete in the next week or so, after which they will be put on a test bench for endurance and fatigue tests.

The propellers are also in assembly, and due to arrive by the end of April. Produced by MT-Propeller — manufacturers of the propellers used on the X3 — the wooden blades will have an optimized shape to improve the aircraft’s performance and noise level. Each propeller will have six blades.

Eye-catching design

One of the most eye-catching evolutions from the X3 is the use of “box wings” over the X3’s conventional wings. These box wings are essentially two short wings on each side, offset enough at their attachment points to the cabin for there to be a gap between each pair when viewed from above. A pusher propeller is attached where each wing pair meets, with the blades set behind the wing.

According to Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters, the use of the box wing and pusher propellers help reduce the power the aircraft needs in forward flight by 12 percent. The box wing also provides a benefit during hover, with its minimized surface area reducing the amount of downwash being blocked compared to a longer wing with a larger chord.

The lower wing “allows a very good integration of the landing gear,” said Krysinski, while the upper wing houses a bearingless supercritical driveshaft, linking the gearbox to the propellers. “This is a very specific technology with soft couplings, [and] we have already qualified them in flight,” he said.

Another striking difference between the X3 and the Racer is the size of the aircraft. The X3 used an AS365 Dauphin airframe as its base, and while Airbus hasn’t given an exact figure for the Racer’s maximum takeoff weight, it will be “in the range of seven to eight tonnes,” and has a nose-to-tail length of about 15 meters.

Reduction of drag is key to the aircraft’s design. Airbus Photo

A key element of the Racer’s design has been the desire to reduce drag — and Krysinski said Airbus has managed to achieve a 45 percent reduction compared to similar size rotorcraft. The box wing helps with this, as does the main rotor. Taken from the H175 (one of the few “borrowed” items on the Racer), it will be slowed by 20 percent in forward flight.

The Racer’s shape also helps, with much smaller frontal drag; long and narrow, Krysinski likened it to that of a fixed-wing aircraft. A helicopter’s main rotor hub is typically a large producer of drag, so the Racer’s design sees this made as aerodynamic as possible — essentially covered by the cowlings.

The aircraft’s asymmetrical tailboom also helps to generate a lateral force, requiring less power from the propellers in hover flight.

“This optimization of the drag was done by very extensive use of advanced CAD tools,” said Krysinski. “We got very strong help from the research centers [as part of Clean Sky 2] in the reduction of the drag.”

The Racer’s tailboom is asymmetrical, acting almost like a wing to generate a lateral force. Airbus Photo

The aircraft will be powered by two Safran Aneto-1X engines, and will incorporate Airbus’s “Eco mode” technology. This will allow the aircraft to put one engine to idle in cruise flight. “On the Racer, we can fly at 180 knots on only one turbine,” said Krysinski. “This will reduce fuel burn by 40 percent.” The technology is potentially applicable to other twin-engine aircraft.

Built for missions

According to Makinadjian, the Racer’s purpose is beyond that of a technology demonstrator.

“The X3 was to demonstrate the technology: are we able to fly at this speed without any technological problems?” he said. “The answer is, ‘Yes.’ And now the question we will answer with this demonstrator is can we perform the mission? And can we demonstrate the efficiency and the speed advantage to the customer with that kind of aircraft?”

“The mission” will depend on the sector targeted: VIP, emergency medical services (EMS) and search-and-rescue (SAR) are all firmly in the Racer’s sights.

Mission simulations will therefore include showcasing the speed of intercity connections for business travellers: flying door-to-door from London to Paris in just one-and-a-half hours, for example.

The Racer will also be fitted with a hoist — installed outside the door at the front of the cabin, seemingly far enough from the box wing and propeller for those things not to be an issue. “We made some simulations with [a] mockup that hoisting is possible,” said Makinadjian. “Now we want to make it in flight.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999987006187439}",neutral,0.999987006187439,0

The announcement was made at Flight Works Alabama and attended by several political figures, including Governor Kay Ivey, Senator Tommy Tuberville, Senator Richard Shelby, and Mayor Sandy Stimpson.

The LMXT tanker aircraft is a variant of the Airbus 330 and will be utilized by the military to refuel fighter, transport, and maritime patrol aircraft mid-air. The project was Lockheed’s submission for the US Air Force “Bridge Tanker” program competition.

According to the company, the plane will first be produced as an A330 airliner at the Airbus facility in Mobile. It will then be sent to Lockheed’s aeronautics facility in Marietta for phase two, converting the commercial aircraft into the LMXT tanker.

“The LMXT represents the newest chapter in Lockheed Martin’s 60-plus year history of producing and delivering tanker and large aircraft for the US Air Force, US Marine Corps, US Navy, and multiple operators around the world,” Lockheed said in a press release.

‘Built in America, by Americans, for Americans’

In 2018, Lockheed and Airbus entered into an agreement to explore viable aerial refueling solutions to address potential capacity shortfalls for the US Air Force.

Lockheed CEO James Taiclet said that establishing production work in the states of Alabama and Georgia only confirms the company’s commitment that the LMXT tanker aircraft will be “built in America, by Americans, for Americans.”

He also asserted that the aircraft will strengthen global security by enabling the US military to carry out critical missions at extended ranges.

Airbus to convert A380 for hydrogen engine flight tests - Aerospace Testing International,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZXRlc3RpbmdpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZsaWdodC10ZXN0aW5nL2FpcmJ1cy10by1jb252ZXJ0LWEzODAtZm9yLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWVuZ2luZS1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdHMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to flight test a hydrogen combustion engine on an A380 as part of its ZeroE program before the end of this decade.

The European aircraft manufacturer is partnering with aero-engine maker CFM International, the long-established joint venture between GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines to provide the first engine for the program.

CFM is to modify a GE Passport turbofan engine to run off hydrogen, while Airbus is configuring MSN1 A380, the first ever A380 built to carry the engine on a support at the top rear right of its fuselage.

MSN1 was used during the certification and testing program for the A380 and to flight test the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines used on the A350.

The conversion of MSN1 A380 into the flying testbed will be complete by the end of 2026. While this is happening CFM will carry out a ground test program. The flight test schedule is still being planned but will happen before 2030.

Sabine Klauke, Airbus’ chief technical officer said, “The aircraft has a testing track record and is already configured as a test aircraft. A stub support will be installed on the exterior for the turbine engine and on the main deck four hydrogen tanks will be installed that are currently being developed in Bremen, Nantes and Madrid.

“Having a four-engined aircraft with the ability to install another engine at the rear is a great opportunity. The asset is a huge one to do all kinds of test flights as well as these engine tests, so it will probably go on to be used afterwards.”

The aircraft will carry 400kg of liquid hydrogen on board and the fuel tanks will be in a hermetically sealed container. After the testing with the Passport engine is completed, other propulsion systems may be tested, including open rotor engines and hydrogen fuel cell systems, added Kaulker.

Hydrogen combustion engine

Engineers at CFM will modify the combustor, fuel system, and control system of the Passport turbofan engine, which is used mainly to power large business jets.

During flight the modified engine will be monitored separately from the other four engines powering the aircraft.

Gael Meheust, president and CEO of CFM International said, “We want to bring to the market breakthrough technologies that will develop the industry, while helping to protect the planet. Any engine we produce in the future will be compatible with alternative fuels such as SAF. But the goal of the industry is zero emission, and hydrogen propulsion is the true zero carbon solution.”

Mohamed Ali, vice president and general manager of GE Aviation said, “This is a big step forward towards a more sustainable aviation industry. Hydrogen is exciting and challenging, but we have more than 800 million hours of hydrogen combustion experience with land based combustion.”

There are several key engineering challenges to solve with the propulsion system, including the development of a new cryogenic fuel delivery system, including a new cryogenic fuel pump, piping and seals.

The liquid hydrogen must converted into gas from its -205˚C temperature before it is burnt in the engine, which means a new heat exchanger must be developed. Hydrogen burns at a higher temperature and ten times faster than jet fuel, which means the use of high temperature materials inside the engine and new ways to control the combustion must be developed

“We will achieve the same or better durability to the engines today,” said Ali. “Our next steps is to modify an existing GE Passport engine, fuel delivery system, combustor and control system.”

As well as the performance of the direct hydrogen combustion system, fuel delivery system and storage tanks, the test program will gather data about the contrails produce by the hydrogen engine in different atmospheric conditions. A hydrogen engine is predicted to release three times as much water into the atmosphere, which some researchers believe could increase the greenhouse gas effect.

Airbus has committed to introducing a zero emission aircraft by 2035 under its ZeroE program, which it launched 18 months ago.

Klauke said, “The overall configuration of the aircraft will be decided at the end of the decade when the technology bricks have been decided and we examine the market. We have four configurations we are looking at in depth, but they are linked to the technology choices.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999676942825317}",neutral,0.9999676942825317,0

Hydrogen Takes Flight: Airbus and CFM International To Partner On Hydrogen-Fueled Demonstration | GE News - General Electric,"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlcG9ydHMvaHlkcm9nZW4tdGFrZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtY2ZtLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtdG8tcGFydG5lci1vbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1mdWVsZWQtMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The race to decarbonize flight just picked up speed. Airbus and CFM International said this week they’ll collaborate on tests of an aircraft engine fueled by hydrogen.

As races go, this is a long-distance one. The partners will go to work immediately, with the aim of performing the first tests around the middle of this decade. This demonstration could pave the way for an aircraft that, if all goes according to plan, would carry passengers in the mid-2030s while producing no carbon emissions during flight.

Airbus, the French aerospace manufacturer, first announced its plans to fly on hydrogen in September 2020, dubbing the project “ZEROe.” The plane-maker unveiled three concept aircraft at the time that would rely on hydrogen as a primary power source and would “help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035,” said CEO Guillaume Faury.

CFM International is a 50/50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.

Hydrogen, which happens to be the most abundant element in the universe, produces no CO 2 emissions when it burns. It has long been held up as a possible potent ally in humanity’s quest to curb carbon emissions.

But the challenges of using it as an aviation fuel are daunting. GE Aviation’s Sean Binion, the hydrogen engine systems leader for the demonstration program, likens these challenges to those faced by the early space industry. Beyond just the technology development aspect, there are very real issues in establishing operating procedures, the development of new infrastructure and — ultimately — certifying a product. He says that it would be impossible without partnerships like this one, which comprises contributors all over the world.

The engineers at GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines — a team that already numbers 100 and is growing fast — are working to modify a GE Passport jet engine. This includes a complete overhaul of its combustor, fuel system and controls system to make them compatible with liquid hydrogen fuel. The group picked the Passport because of its size, advanced turbomachinery and ability to operate at the appropriate pressures and temperatures for the flight platform.

When flight tests begin around the mid-2020s, the modified engine will be mounted on the rear top of the fuselage on an Airbus A380, the world’s largest commercial airliner, powered by its original four engines. But the new configuration will allow the team to test the modified hydrogen-powered engine’s emissions, including contrails, and monitor them separately.

Massimo Varriani, European system leader for the hydrogen program at Avio Aero, a GE Aviation company, says “the purpose of the project is to demonstrate the technology,” and the resulting prototype will later be scalable to work with different sizes of engines and different types of aircraft applications. Ultimately, it could be applied to various designs like Airbus’s three ZEROe concepts, which include a turbofan engine, a turboprop and a futuristic blended-wing design. “What is important is that we demonstrate we can fly with an engine that is burning just hydrogen, we have the storage capability of hydrogen in the aircraft and we have a system that is capable of distributing the hydrogen fuel into the combustor with the proper characteristics,” Varriani says.

Storing the hydrogen onboard presents another big engineering challenge. Because H 2 naturally exists as a gas — which, if carried in sufficient amounts for passenger jet travel, would take up more storage space than the entire plane — it will need to be stored in liquid form, which means cooling it to about minus 253 Celsius (423 degrees Fahrenheit). That liquid hydrogen will then need to be vaporized into gas to be used as fuel — this will mean that certain parts of the engine could see temperature differences of some 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

It’s no small task, but Binion believes the team is up to the challenge: “CFM is committed to working with our partners to decarbonize aviation,” he says. “And our team is passionate about succeeding on this project. It’s both exciting and gratifying … We’re very tangibly inventing and executing on a key element of the future of sustainable flight.”

In October 2021, the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation industry by 2050, by helping deliver the technologies to make that possible. CFM and Airbus, as signatories to that pledge, have both rolled out ambitious plans in recent years.

CFM’s RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) Program, announced in June 2021, aims to develop the technology that could lead to an engine that would use 20% less fuel and produce 20% fewer CO 2 emissions than the most efficient jet engines today using conventional jet fuel. Additionally, a configuration compatible with hydrogen technology developed as part of the CFM and Airbus combustion demonstration would result in zero carbon emissions during flight.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from renewable biomass and waste products, has also started to take off: Last October, Etihad Airways employed a fuel blend containing SAF among an array of existing solutions on a regularly scheduled long-haul flight from London to Abu Dhabi. That flight produced carbon emissions 72% below those of an equivalent flight two years earlier. In December, United Airlines operated the world’s first passenger flight using 100% SAF in one of its CFM LEAP-1B engines.

But for airlines to move their fleets over to H 2 , there will need to be a concerted effort to produce more H 2 — which can be done in a more renewable fashion if the power used to produce it is derived from sources like wind and solar. The good news is, GE Gas Power already has years of experience in using hydrogen in power plants; its turbines have logged more than 8 million operating hours running on blends of hydrogen, including green hydrogen in several recent demonstration projects. The knowledge and experience from those projects will be one of many instances of cross-pollination within GE and across the partnership that Binion says are reason for optimism.

Gaël Méheust, president and CEO of CFM International, agrees: “Bringing together the collective capabilities and experience of CFM, our parent companies, and Airbus, we really do have the dream team in place to successfully demonstrate a hydrogen propulsion system.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997579455375671}",neutral,0.9997579455375671,0
"Eurofighter paint jobs: Strip-on, strip-off - Airbus","Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAyLWV1cm9maWdodGVyLXBhaW50LWpvYnMtc3RyaXAtb24tc3RyaXAtb2Zm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Removing special livery and returning a Eurofighter to active duty in its regular grey paint-scheme can be quite a challenge – especially if you are doing it for the first time. A (picture) feature on how the Airbus Defence and Space team at Eurofighter Kooperation Zelle in Manching made it happen anyway.

Specially painted fighter or transport aircraft are a familiar sight in many air forces. For special occasions or dedicated units, such as the famous NATO Tigers, some aircraft are given a beautiful design for a certain period of time.

Eurofighter 30+68 (GS0050) took off with a special paint livery ever since the Luftwaffe celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016.

Eurofighter 30+68 (GS 0050) took off with a special paint livery ever since the Luftwaffe celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016.

In most cases today, jets receive a special film that is comparatively easy to apply and to remove. In some cases, however, they receive a full-blown paint job.

While beautiful to look at, applying and especially removing the paint is a tremendous challenge. It’s a very real challenge that the teams at the Eurofighter Kooperation Zelle, or EKZ, in Manching faced for the very first time in 2021.

While beautiful to look at, the special livery had to come off eventually so the fighter jet could return to active duty.

In late January 2021, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) delivered Eurofighter 30+68 (GS0050) from its home base in Neuburg, Bavaria to Manching for regular maintenance. At the time, that particular jet was carrying a special paint livery from 2016, when the Luftwaffe celebrated its 60th anniversary. As part of the maintenance, the jet was also slated to have its special livery removed and returned to service in the regular grey paint scheme.

Sounds like a straightforward plan – only it wasn’t.

“We had a tremendous amount of respect for that job since scraping the paint off a fully painted jet wasn’t something we had done before,” said Peter Hadwiger, Head of EKZ at Airbus Defence and Space. “We had to think carefully about how to proceed and, of course, to ensure that we could perform all the other activities we do when we overhaul a jet from scratch to stay within the planned timeframe.”

The German single seater Eurofighter 30+68 (GS0050) arrived at the EKZ hangar in Manching in January 2021 to be overhauled from scratch.

The pure maintenance work on the one hand and the removal of the paint on many parts on the other hand required close coordination between the teams at EKZ.

Communication and coordination between all of the departments involved turned out to be spot on, even if the overall effort cost “a lot of nerves,” recalled Stefan Spiegl, Dockchief Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul at Airbus Defence and Space.

“To avoid damage to the parts and to remove the paint effectively, we had to go about the task very prudently,” Stefan said.

Furthermore, as this effort represented a first, alignment with the coordination and planning teams was of utmost importance. “For MRO, it was the first jet where the entire surface coating had to be sanded down and renewed.”

The complete surface coating had to be sanded down.

As a result, he said, work plans had to be adjusted.

“There was an adjustment to the operational work plan that resulted in a considerable additional effort beyond the standard measure,” added Stefan Kober, Process Engineer with Airbus Defence and Space in Manching.

The overall time of the aircraft spent at the EKZ in 2021 was stretched a bit until the so-called “power on” as many parts had to be transferred to the paint shop.

The challenge the paint shop faced was that there were no written rules or certified work processes for such a detailed exercise, recalled Thomas Biesendorfer, Group Lead Surface for Eurofighter and Tornado aircraft at Airbus Defence and Space.

What helped the team tremendously was the experience of several individuals from the automotive industry.

“Several of us, myself included, are certified car painters. So we went back to our roots and basically applied our automotive expertise. Along the way, we developed new processes and validated every step with our Quality Assurance colleagues. For that, we used the smaller parts of the aircraft that were sent to us early on,” said Thomas.

Small parts first: The car-painting expertise of the team came in handy when new processes had to be created and validated.

Compared to the Tornado, special attention must be given to the parts that are often made of carbon fibre.

“MRO is, after all, manual work. Our experience from having worked on cars, which also use carbon fibre, was invaluable. It helped us prove that we could do the job. It showed that no matter how big the challenge, we can find a solution,” Thomas said.

MRO colleagues needed to give special attention to the parts made out of carbon-fibre material

The smaller parts, which were disassembled from the Eurofighter, received their primer within a week and were put back on the jet, which was undergoing maintenance.

The smaller parts were disassembled from the Eurofighter first and laid out on a table to be further processed.

In fact, to save time as much as possible, the aircraft was given special clearance to perform the necessary check flights, during which some of the parts still had paint applied while the primer had already been applied to others. This “Frankenstein” version made for a rare sight in the skies over Manching in the autumn of 2021.

Rare sight above Manching: The “Frankenstein” version takes off for one of its check flights.

Typically, Airbus’s own test crews perform several check flights before the aircraft is returned to its operational unit.

After the check flights had been successfully concluded, Thomas said, the jet was handed over to the Surface team to strip off the paint from the last major parts, such as the wings, and apply the standard grey paint.

“The paint stripping on this particular aircraft had a great side effect,” said Thomas. It had been the first full paint job since the last series production aircraft.

Thomas and his colleagues took the opportunity to certify an improved water-based paint system that uses significantly less solvent and is now ready for use in all future cases.

“We want and need to become more sustainable in what we do, and this particular job enabled us to put a new system in place that allows us to become ‘greener’ when painting an aircraft,” said Thomas. Werner Resch, Head of the Surface Treatment department, added: “I am very proud of the team’s great performance. The topic of paint stripping from fibre composites will take on an ever greater role in the future. Projects like these give us the opportunity to expand our competencies.”

Men at work: Georg Brummer, Nico Buttgereit, Tobias Leunens, Andreas Brandmeier and Thomas Biesendorfer (from left to right).

In the case of 30+68, the aircraft was handed back to Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 74 in early December 2021 and immediately reintegrated into daily operations.

Despite the complexity of the job, the Airbus teams were satisfied.

“Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and many people therefore working from home, this job reflects very good cooperation between all the departments involved. We often talk about ‘We are one’ as a motto in the company. This job here really showed that it is the case,” concluded Gerry-Norman Doerfl, Aircraft Manager at Airbus Defence and Space.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8077862858772278}",neutral,0.8077862858772278,0

Estimated reading time 7 minutes, 18 seconds.

After unveiling its ZEROe concept aircraft nearly 18 months ago, Airbus on Feb. 22 announced it is taking the next step toward its ZEROe initiative by partnering with CFM International to develop a flight test demonstrator based on hydrogen.

The objective of the hydrogen demonstration program is to ground and flight test a direct combustion engine fueled by hydrogen, as part of Airbus’s goal to market a zero-emission aircraft by 2035.

Airbus said during a Feb. 22 press conference that it will use an A380 aircraft as the ZEROe hydrogen combustion demonstrator, equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks that will supply the engine which is located along the rear fuselage of the aircraft. Airbus said the A380 was selected as the demonstrator due to the space available on the aircraft to install the additional systems required for the program.

According to Sabine Klauke, Airbus chief technical officer, a number of changes must be made to the A380 to transform it into a hydrogen demonstrator. First, support will be installed on the aircraft to add a gas turbine for hydrogen combustion. Then, just below the main deck, four liquid hydrogen tanks will be installed and stored in a caudal position. Lastly, “we will install the distribution system right to the engine in order to make it fly,” said Klauke.

The tanks, which will be hermetically sealed, are to be delivered from Airbus’s new zero-emission development centers. Different materials are currently being evaluated for the hydrogen tanks, including CFRP, composite, and metal. In terms of hydrogen capacity, Klauke said 400 kilos of liquid hydrogen will be used on the A380 for this demonstration.

As part of the program, CFM International — which is a 50/50 joint company between GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines — will modify the combustor, fuel system, and control system of a GE Passport turbofan to run on hydrogen. It will be mounted along the rear fuselage of the flying testbed to allow engine emissions, including contrails, to be monitored separately from those of the engines powering the aircraft. CFM will complete extensive ground tests prior to the A380 flight tests.

The U.S.-manufactured GE Passport engine was selected for the program because of its “physical size, advanced turbo machinery, and fuel flow capability,” Airbus said.

Mohamed Ali, vice president of engineering at GE Aviation, explained in detail what hydrogen will mean for the engine and the propulsion system: “To distribute the fuel from the storage tanks to the engine combustor, it will require the development of a new cryogenic fuel delivery system. Before the liquid hydrogen can enter the engine’s combustion chamber, we will need to convert it into gas to be burned cleanly inside the combustor.

“Unlike jet fuel, hydrogen is actually then injected into the combustor as gas, making its mixing with air to actually be easier. But hydrogen burns at much higher temperatures than jet fuel does today,” Ali continued, adding that CFM will build on its current advanced materials, coatings, cooling technology, and developed combustor and turbine parts that can withstand such temperatures.

While burning hotter means greater susceptibility to other emissions, such as nitrogen oxide, Ali said CFM intends to combine the expertise of GE and Safran to minimize nitrogen oxide formation.

Moreover, Ali said hydrogen burns 10 times faster than jet fuel, which will require new designs and technologies to control the flame and make it stable.

“As our next steps, we will modify an existing GE Passport engine for the purposes of this program, adjusting its fuel distribution system, combustor, and controls to work with hydrogen. We will fly the modified engine . . . to prove out the technologies. What we learn from this program will inform us about potential future engine developments.”

While Airbus, of course, is providing the A380 platform to test the hydrogen combustion engine in cruise phase, the OEM will also be responsible for defining the hydrogen propulsion system requirements and overseeing flight testing.

Ground tests have already begun with some of the technological aspects, and the goal is to fly by the end of 2026 — which will prepare the program for maturation into 2035, “as we want to be in the market by then,” said Airbus’s Klauke.

In terms of the certification of hydrogen propulsion, Michel Brioude, Safran chief technical officer, said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency are “really open-minded to working with us” on the hydrogen demonstration program. CFM is currently working with the regulators to determine the key points in terms of certification, as well as the regulatory requirements to demonstrate that they can fly safely.

“It’s our view that hydrogen propulsion is a fundamental part of the long-term solution,” said Jeff Knittel, Airbus Americas chairman and CEO. “And we remain realistic about the challenges that such a transformation of aviation presents. We are committed to this new aviation future, and we fully embrace the opportunity and the challenges that lie ahead.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999864101409912}",neutral,0.9999864101409912,0

Boeing Hopes MAX Family Dents Airbus Dominance In Southeast Asia - Aviation Week,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2xvY2F0aW9uL2JvZWluZy1ob3Blcy1tYXgtZmFtaWx5LWRlbnRzLWFpcmJ1cy1kb21pbmFuY2Utc291dGhlYXN0LWFzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE—Boeing hopes future deliveries of its 737-7 and -10 will help prospective customers “leverage the values” of the respective MAX family aircraft and “unlock growth potential in Southeast Asia,” a market that is currently dominated by competitor Airbus.

In the latest commercial market outlook, Boeing says Southeast Asia needs 4,415 new aircraft over the next 20 years. Single-aisle aircraft dominate with 3,600 aircraft—82% of the total.

Without giving specifics on its expectations for market share over the next 20 years, Boeing VP of commercial marketing Darren Hulst says the target is to win as many customer campaigns as possible in the region.

“I will say our strategy with the 737 in the single-aisle space is to utilize the whole family of aircraft, not just one type that appeals to one customer,” he said.

“It's leveraging the family of the MAX and it's ultimately helping airlines optimize their cost, and the lowest cost per seat is critical in the LCC competition.”

AviationWeek fleet database shows that across Southeast Asia Airbus has 406 of its narrowbody in service and 816 on order, while Boeing has 249 of the 737 family in service and 625 in its backlog.

Newly built freighter growth remains modest at 1% for 25 aircraft, but demand for airfreight will spur the need for both narrow and widebody freighter conversions, which are not factored into the CMO. Hulst thinks that there might be an opportunity for 777 converted freighters in the region.

“There is some licensing on the 777 freighter conversion program and we will continue to see how that will complement our production freighter family. The 777F has seen record number of sales in 2021 but the growth in e-commerce which embraces volume could play a role in some decisions.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.871728241443634}",positive,0.871728241443634,1
Airbus and Singapore's Institute of Technical Education reaffirm commitment to developing local aerospace talent - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2FpcmNyYWZ0LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMi1haXJidXMtYW5kLXNpbmdhcG9yZXMtaW5zdGl0dXRlLW9mLXRlY2huaWNhbC1lZHVjYXRpb24tcmVhZmZpcm0tY29tbWl0bWVudC10by1kZXZlbG9waW5nLWxvY2FsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS10YWxlbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 16 February 2022 - Airbus, together with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) of Singapore have signed two agreements that will see both parties expand their collaboration in the area of aerospace training.

The first is a Memorandum of Understanding, in which Airbus will support ITE in developing future generations of engineers and mechanics in accordance with the aviation industry’s standards.

This will be achieved through the enhancement of ITE’s training programme and curriculum to meet the aircraft manufacturer’s standards and better address the needs of new generation aircraft such as Airbus’ A350. Under the agreement, Airbus will work with ITE to augment their basic maintenance training curriculum by co-developing composite structure repair training and extending instructors’ competencies.

In addition Testia, an Airbus company, will support ITE in developing Non Destructive Testing capability for their education curriculum. This includes the development of practical sessions and group projects, as well organising technology talks for students, in line with the latest industry trends.

“As the aviation industry undergoes transformation, it has become paramount for us to equip our students with the knowledge and skills for new maintenance and material standards. The partnerships with aviation leader Airbus, as well as Testia, will reinforce our work in preparing aviation professionals who have relevant skills. We are also honoured to be amongst the first educational institutions in the Asia-Pacific region to adopt and implement the Airbus Competence Training for Academy training solution into our teaching curriculum,” said Low Khah Gek, Chief Executive Officer of ITE.

“Quality training is key to help mechanics develop and maintain both competences and confidence and to ensure safe & efficient operations while reducing Operators & MROs training efforts and associated costs,” added Valerie Manning, Senior Vice President, Airbus Training & Flight Operations Services.

“Supporting academies in bringing the training effort upstream in the education path helps prepare young aerospace students for a career in the aviation industry. Airbus is committed to equipping them with the necessary skills to acquire basic knowledge of modern aircraft to meet their career challenges, and supporting operators and maintenance organisations by minimising additional costly and time-consuming training efforts after recruitment,” she added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9288156628608704}",neutral,0.9288156628608704,0
Airbus confirms the A380 as ZEROe hydrogen demonstrator | - AirInsight,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNvbmZpcm1zLXRoZS1hMzgwLWFzLXplcm9lLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

It was a rumor for some months, but Airbus has finally confirmed that it will use its A380 test aircraft MSN001 as a demonstrator for its ZEROe hydrogen program. The aircraft will be converted to get a General Electric Passport engine on the port side of the fuselage and start flight testing by the end of 2026 in a joint project with CFM, it was announced on February 22. Airbus confirms the A380 as ZEROe hydrogen demonstrator.

Airbus unveiled ZEROe in September 2020 with the presentation of three hydrogen-powered airliners for 100 and 200 passengers, including a turboprop, a turbofan-powered aircraft, and a blended wing, of which another version was added later. Then-Chief Technical Officer Grazia Vittadini (now with Rolls-Royce) said that Airbus would do its research and development until 2025, before starting flight test on a demonstrator. Around 2027, it would then make technology choices and launch the first airliner program, targeting entry into service in or around 2035.

Current CTO Sabine Klauke said during an online media event that this schedule is still up to date. Airbus will still develop the various ‘technological bricks’ in the next few years, together with its partners like General Electric, Safran/CFM, Air Liquide, and its own Zero-Emission Development Centers in Bremen (Germany), Nantes (France), and Madrid (Spain). Flight testing will start by the end of 2026, which perfectly fits the original schedule for a decision by the late-20s and an entry into service around 2035.

As part of the technology bricks, GE and Safran will first start ground tests with the GE Passport engine. The 18.000-20.000 pounds of thrust engine has been developed since 2010 for the Bombardier Global 7500 business jet and has been in service since 2018. As Mohamed Ali, GE’s Vice President and General Manager of the Engineering Division explained, CFM will start ground tests with a modified engine using conventional Jet-A fuel to establish basic data, before transiting to hydrogen.

The super-cold (-253 Celsius) liquid fuel will be gasified and injected directly into the combustion chamber. Numerous tests will establish the characteristics of hydrogen, which burns at much-higher temperatures compared to kerosene, burns faster, and can cause flashbacks. GE will look into its vast array of metals, coatings, and ceramics to see what material is best suited to withstand the temperatures. “What we learn from this program will inform us about potential future engine developments”, said Ali. “Is hydrogen harder? Yes. Is it doable? Absolutely! But we are building on our huge experience.”

MSN001 to be extensively modified

In the run-up to 2026 and already this year, Airbus will start extensive modifications on MSN001, the first A380 that made its first flight in 2005 and has been kept on for numerous testing programs, including that of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-engines and recently sustainable aviation fuels. The conversion into a hydrogen platform will be its most extensive ever. For one, the aircraft will get a dedicated structure on top of the aft upper deck, on which the Passport engine will be mounted on the port side.

Klauke said that this position has been chosen on purpose: “Actually, the position is here to really well measure as well the atmosphere as the overall system. We have very good integration with the tanks, the system, and the engine, but we also want to measure everything associated with the atmosphere.” This includes emissions and contrail formation of the hydrogen engine at different engines, which should not interfere with those from the conventional engines under the wings.

Although the Passport has a by-pass ratio (fan : core) of just 5.6:1, GE’s Mohamed Ali doesn’t see that as an issue when it comes to studying emissions, notably nitrogen oxides and three times more water. “One of the reasons we selected Passport is that it is quite representative of what needs to happen. Passport is quite suited, particularly in the design and in the core, which actually affects the whole combustion. We can give us insights on which we can build for the future.” The difference with the CFM LEAP would be small from a testing point of view, but is much bigger and heavier than would have required more structural modifications on the A380, added CFM President and CEO Gaël Meheust.

Four hydrogen tanks on the main deck

Except for the engine installation, the A380 testbed will require further changes. Aft on the main deck, there will be four hydrogen tanks with a combined capacity of 400 kilograms. For safety reasons, they will be inside dedicated capsules. The tanks are currently being designed in Bremen and Nantes. The tanks have taken a lot of effort, ZEROe Vice President Glenn Llewellyn told AirInsight last September. The quantity of LH2 is sufficient for the tests that are planned, said Klauke. More modifications will be made to the cockpit, with dedicated controls and displays for the Passport engine.

A completely new fuel delivery system also needs to be designed, including new fuel pumps. A newly designed heat exchanger will convert the liquid LH2 into gas that can withstand the highest temperature differences and pressures, explained Michel Brioude, CTO at Safran Aircraft Engine.

It is too early to say how many test flights will be needed before engineers are satisfied and have adequate data, but it will be a key technology brick before Airbus will determine what the actual hydrogen airliner will look like. Shapes and size will come later, as will be the testing of fuel cells that produce electricity out of hydrogen and oxygen. GE and Safran will use the lessons learned in their RISE technology program, which they launched in June 2021. “All our teams are dedicated to that and for the next two decades, it will be their top priority”, said Brioude.

Airbus, GE nor Safran were willing to disclose how much they invest in the program. “It is immense work that is needed, but it will be part of our overall R&D plans”, said Sabine Klauke. Airbus said last week that this budget will increase to some €2.9 billion this year. Meheust said the funding will come via its regular R&D spending, but it is hoped that the program will benefit from various government projects.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999916553497314}",neutral,0.9999916553497314,0

Andreas, can you please tell us what TEXUS is all about?

TEXUS (Technological Experiments in Zero Gravity) is the world's most successful and longest lasting sounding rocket programme – the first TEXUS rocket launched in December 1977. Sounding rockets – also known as research rockets – launch scientific and technological experiments to the edge of space before falling back to Earth. Put simply, TEXUS helps scientists conduct biological, material science and physical experiments under space conditions. The programme also plays an important role in preparing experiments for the International Space Station (ISS).

How often do TEXUS rockets take off?

On average, once a year. The rockets are launched from the Esrange Space Centre – an almost unknown location in the very north of Sweden, above the Arctic Circle. Here, the scientific payload can be easily recovered and returned to the research teams less than two hours after launch.

What does a TEXUS flight involve?

In ballistic flight a TEXUS rocket reaches a height of about 260 kilometres. The flight, from take-off to landing, takes about 15 minutes. For six minutes, an approximate weightlessness is reached, which is only about one ten thousandth of the Earth’s normal gravity. During the flight, the scientists can directly control and monitor their experiments from the ground using telecommand and video transmission. The data is collected during the flight by telemetry or after recovery of the payload.

The rocket’s payload then lands by parachute and is salvaged by helicopter with the support of Airbus and the Swedish Space Corporation, Esrange’s operator.

Tell us more about the next launch

TEXUS 57 – which, as the name suggests, is the fifty-seventh mission – is scheduled for launch on 28 February. It will have four experiments on board, located in autonomous modules within the rocket, one on top of the other. Customers include the European Space Agency and the German Aerospace Centre on behalf of various universities.

What is Airbus' contribution?

Airbus engineers from different disciplines develop, integrate and test the experimental equipment. In collaboration with customers and scientific teams, our engineers establish experimental concepts. Breadboard tests are conducted to support design decisions. Depending on the results, further tests may be required to determine or verify critical parameters of the experiment before launch. Design reviews with customers ensure that their requirements are fully met.

What else?

Finally, the experimental equipment is integrated, tested at various stages and verified. All this goes hand-in-hand with the development of the ground support systems needed to control the experiments during the test phase in Bremen and during the flight from Esrange.

Before transferring all flight hardware and ground systems to Esrange, we organise a flight system acceptance review with our customers, which also covers the contributions of our subcontractors: the service system (communication between the experiments and the ground station), the recovery system (parachutes), the rocket engines (solid propellant) and the readiness of the facilities at Esrange.

Why are we still doing microgravity tests with sounding rockets when the Airbus Bartolomeo platform on the ISS offers this possibility?

There are many different platforms for performing scientific or technological experiments in microgravity. Bartolomeo is an ideal platform for many applications that require extended microgravity conditions, and is delivering very interesting and important research. Nevertheless, there are many other fields of research where a short microgravity time provides excellent results.

Terrestrial options include sounding rockets, parabolic flights and drop towers – a ground-based structure used to produce a short period of microgravity for an object under study.

Numerous experiments onboard the ISS have actually gone through several pre-cursor missions on the ZARM Drop Tower, a microgravity laboratory in Bremen, parabolic and sounding rocket flights to determine the optimum design and the best parameters beforehand.

Many phenomena have been observed and proven on our sounding rocket flights with TEXUS and MAXUS, a larger research rocket that can carry a heavier payload and offers a longer period of microgravity.For our customers, these flights contribute to risk reduction, provide cost-efficient validation and deliver high-quality results.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999939203262329}",neutral,0.9999939203262329,0

German aerostructure unit Airbus gets a go from July | - AirInsight,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vZ2VybWFuLWFlcm9zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtdW5pdC1haXJidXMtZ2V0cy1hLWdvLWZyb20tanVseS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

After successfully integrating its aerostructure businesses in France and Canada under Airbus Atlantic since January, Airbus is now ready to do the same in Germany. From July 1, Airbus’ own aerostructure units and that of Premium AEROTEC will form the new unit, CEO Guillaume Faury said on February 17. German aerostructure unit Airbus gets a go from July.

The integration in Germany within what is called ASA follows on the completion of a new, long-term collective bargaining agreement on February 1 with influential union IG Metall.

German unions and the works council for long opposed the integration of Premium AEROTEC production sites in Nordenham, Augsburg (I-III), and Bremen with that of Airbus Stade and Hamburg. Unions feared the loss of thousands of jobs, especially as Airbus intends to spin-off a separate unit for detail parts. This includes the Premium AEROTEC plants at Augsburg (IV) and Brasov (Rumania) and that of Airbus in Varel. Airbus first announced the integration of its aerostructure businesses early in 2021.

The recent agreement with IG Metall for Airbus Operations and Premium AEROTEC excludes redundancies for operational reasons until 2030. There will no split of the Augsburg site. Individual locations will also remain in place until the end of 2030 and will be involved in possible future aircraft programs.

No solution yet for the detailed parts unit

However, discussions on the future of the detail parts business. “We are still evaluating together with a company called Mubea and our partners IG Metall what is the best way forward. We have given ourselves a couple of months to come to conclusions”, Faury said during an online press conference. IG Metall has said that joint talks with Mubea about the potential transfer to ASA no later than 2025 will continue until March 31. “Without the consent of IG Metall, there will be no sale of Augsburg or Varel”, the union said in a February 1 media statement.

Mubea, short of Muhr & Bender KG, is a supplier of lightweight parts to the aerospace and automotive industry and has been working with Airbus and Premium AEROTEC on all commercial aircraft programs for over a decade. The company made a “compelling offer” on February 1 to acquire the detail parts units from Premium AEROTEC. By acquiring the unit, Mubea wants to expand its position in the aerospace industry. Mubea said its waiting for the outcome of the negotiations between Airbus and IG Metall.

The Airbus works council supports the agreement between Airbus and IG Metall on the main aerostructure integration. “The collective bargaining agreement will secure jobs in the long term and create prospects for the sites under the umbrella of Airbus. Redundancies for operational reasons are excluded until the end of 2030. In addition, there are firm commitments for investments that can be used to further develop the sites. This is a good basis for jointly ramping up production and working on the aircraft of the future”, chairman Holger Junge is quoted in the IG Metall release.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999148845672607}",neutral,0.9999148845672607,0

Airbus targets summer for FAA H160 approval - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWxhbWVudHMtcmVsYXRpdmVseS1wYWluZnVsLXByb2Nlc3MtaDE2MC1mYWEtYXBwcm92YWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is confident of finally securing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of its H160 this summer — almost two years later than it had originally hoped — paving the way for the type to begin an offshore route-proving program in partnership with PHI and Shell.

The new medium-lift aircraft was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on July 1, 2020, and the manufacturer had anticipated FAA approval to follow soon afterwards, paving the way for first deliveries later in the year to launch customers in the U.S.

“[There was] an assumption, based on all of the history we have with the authorities, that when you’ve certified with EASA, the additional work to certify with the FAA is some clarification and relatively minor gaps to be explored with that authority,” Gilles Armstrong, head of the H160 program, told journalists attending a media event at Airbus. “It turns out in this particular instance that the FAA has opened up a lot more topics than what was expected — and those topics are sometimes quite complex.”

He said the process of reopening those topics, discussing them, and closing them has been “very severely hampered” by the Covid-enforced necessity to do it remotely.

“To reach understanding — despite having very frequent video calls etc. with the FAA — has been a relatively painful process,” said Armstrong.

The topics are being closed in a “painstaking line-by-line process,” he added, with only “a few” left open.

He admitted the delay had forced back the type’s entry into service, as the first H160s had been destined for operation in the U.S. Instead, Japan’s All Nippon Helicopter received the world’s first H160, celebrating the landmark delivery on Dec. 10, 2021. Training on the aircraft has been completed, said Armstrong, and it is now being outfitted with the various cameras and video processing equipment needed for its electronic newsgathering mission.

PHI’s first H160 will appear in the company’s livery next month at this year’s edition of Helicopter Association International Heli-Expo, in Dallas, Texas. After the show, the aircraft will join the FAA’s Flight Standardization Board, which will evaluate the type’s training systems. Once that’s complete, it will finally enter service in the U.S., joining PHI on its route-proving program.

The landmark will be one of many for the H160 this year, along with expected entry-into-service in the U.K., France, Japan and Brazil. The Japanese and Brazilian regulators have already approved the type’s certification. Approval from regulators in China and Russia is the next target.

Armstrong said the program was now entering a new phase, coming out of a development cycle and moving into entry-into-service with an industrial ramp-up.

The final assembly line (FAL) was performing “remarkably well,” he added. There are currently eight H160s on the FAL, with another seven on the flight line. The FAL is not yet running at full speed — it hopes to hit that mark in the middle of next year. At that point, Airbus will be able to produce 35 H160s per year, with each aircraft taking just 40 days to complete its journey through the FAL.

A multi-mission machine

Airbus claims the H160 is suited to every operating sector — and it has a pretty balanced orderbook for the type. VIP and oil-and-gas customers dominate orders from the U.S., French customers are largely in public services, and VIP customers make up the majority of the remainder.

“I think for the VIP sector, it has incredible looks, it has incredible flyability, there’s a lot of safety features. . . . [so] if you’re going to be able to buy anything you like, this is really what you want to be buying,” said Armstrong. He said the H160 was available at an “absolutely competitive” cost — both in terms of upfront and lifecycle costs.

“It’s slightly smaller, slightly cheaper than the [AW]139,” he said. “But it’s capable to do almost everything the 139 does. And so for the large majority of customers, this is going to be a more fuel efficient, better targeted answer to their mission.”

Meanwhile, Airbus is continuing the development of optional equipment and capabilities, such as hoisting, carrying sling loads, and operation in sandy environments. The former will be required for six hoist-equipped H160s ordered by Babcock, which will be operating them in a search-and-rescue configuration on behalf of the French Navy.

Armstrong said hoist certification was imminent. “We’re in the final phases . . . very close to the point where those will be ready,” he said.

The H160 orderbook — roughly 90 aircraft — has been swollen by a major contract with the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) for 10 of the type for the Gendarmerie Nationale. The contract, signed in January 2020, saw France become the first H160 law enforcement customer.

“[There is] a very specific focus to have those aircraft ready before the [Paris 2024] Olympic Games,” said Armstrong. “We’re already in the phases where we’re starting the structural assembly of those aircraft. . . . Next year will be a year of testing, certifying and delivering ready for being operational before the Olympics.”

Work also continues on the H160M Guepard — the militarized version of the type — following the DGA’s landmark order for a first batch of 30 in the frame of the Light Joint Helicopter program (HIL) on Dec. 22, 2021.

AMSTERDAM – Airbus booked a record profit of 4.2 billion euros ($4.8 billion) last year as the aircraft maker delivered more planes with the global economy rebounding from the coronavirus pandemic.

It is the first annual profit for the Toulouse, France, manufacturer since 2018, before the spread of COVID-19 reduced air travel to levels not seen since before the jet era.

Airbus delivered 611 commercial aircraft in 2021, up from 566 the year before. It's an important source of cash for aircraft manufacturers, driving revenue of 52.1 billion euros ($59.2 billion) for Airbus last year.

And the company expects to carry that momentum through 2022, forecasting Thursday that it will deliver 720 commercial aircraft this year.

Orders were also robust in its helicopter and defense and space businesses.

CEO Guillaume Faury said “2021 was a year of transition, where our attention shifted from navigating the pandemic towards recovery and growth.""

Accentuating that point, Faury said Airbus plans to reintroduce a dividend of 1.50 euro ($1.70) per share, its first in two years.

The company recently canceled Qatar Airways orders for several planes amid a dispute over the quality of paint and surfaces on some Airbus jets. The Middle Eastern carrier is suing Airbus in a London court.

The spat has benefited U.S. rival Boeing, with Qatar announcing that it plans to order Boeing 737 Max jets instead.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998910427093506}",positive,0.9998910427093506,1
Airbus building flying testbed to evaluate hydrogen combustion jet engine - New Atlas,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy10ZXN0YmVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWV2YWx1YXRpbmctaHlkcm9nZW4tY29tYnVzdGlvbi1qZXQtZW5naW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, in partnership with CFM International (a joint company of GE and Safran Aircraft Engines), is developing an A380 flying testbed called the ZEROe Demonstrator to examine how hydrogen combustion can be used to power turbofan jet engines.

From an environmental point of view, hydrogen is an attractive alternative to conventional jet aviation fuel for an aerospace sector that has pledged to go carbon-free by 2050. In its gaseous form it's almost as easy to handle as natural gas, it burns readily and relatively clean, and leaves behind only water and 90 percent fewer nitrogen oxides emissions than kerosene.

At a superficial glance, it seems like an ideal substitute, but a closer look shows that there's a long way to go before we see hydrogen-burning jetliners taxiing up to the gate. For example, it would be easy to say that it does away with nasty fossil fuels, but most of the hydrogen produced on an industrial scale comes from petroleum through the steam-methane process. So using hydrogen as a green fuel would mean a huge shift in production to alternatives like biomass or electrolysis of water using non-fossil-fuel energy sources, and all of the infrastructure issues such a shift would entail.

The hydrogen jet engine will mounted on the stern of the fuselage Airbus

If that wasn't enough, hydrogen has other problems. Though it has 2.5 times the specific energy of kerosene it has a much lower energy density and occupies four times the volume. This means that a one-for-one swap of hydrogen for conventional fuels would mean an aircraft could only fly a quarter as far.

To offset this, the hydrogen would have to be turned into a cryogenic state, where the it's converted to a liquid at -420 °F (-250 °C) that would require it to be carried in specially insulated tanks that would be four times as large as current tanks. This would require aircraft that would have a bulbous appearance or be designed with a blended body where the wing and the fuselage merge into one.

This introduces its own problems because these hydrogen planes would have a larger surface-to-volume ratio, which means more aerodynamic drag and reduced fuel efficiency. However, the hydrogen would be lighter than conventional fuel, which would introduce a trade off.

The alternative might be to simply live with a shorter range, but this is a problem because producing and handling cryogenic hydrogen is extremely dangerous and expensive, so it would be preferable to need as few refueling locations as possible along any given route.

On the other hand, it would be possible to design a hydrogen-powered plane that retains most of the conventional control systems and basic jet engine configurations, so certification wouldn't pose the major problem that an entirely new class of plane would entail.

In addition, using hydrogen in jet engines isn't a new idea. The first German jet engine made in 1937 used hydrogen for ground tests, and a Martin B-57B Canberra bomber flew for 20 minutes on hydrogen in 1957. Since then, there have been a number of studies into using hydrogen as an alternative form of jet fuel. A number of auto manufacturers are also exploring the potential of hydrogen combustion engines to power vehicles closer to the ground.

Now, Airbus and CFM International are working on a demonstrator for a hydrogen jet engine that is expected to fly in the next few years and could lead to the introduction of a zero-emission aircraft by 2035.

Under the new agreement, Airbus will provide an A380 aircraft for conversion into the ZEROe Demonstrator flying testbed with caudal hydrogen tanks installed in the fuselage and will determine the system requirements for the test engine, which will be a GE Passport turbofan with a combustor modified by CFM to burn hydrogen.

The new engine will not be powering the A380, which will use conventional engines. Instead, the hydrogen engine will be mounted on the fuselage toward the stern. This will allow the engineers to monitor the emissions of the hydrogen engine while in cruise mode without interference from the engines mounted under the wings.

""This is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,"" said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. ""By leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.""

Airbus to use A380 to Test Hydrogen Combustion Technology - Sam Chui,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yMi9haXJidXMtdG8tdXNlLWEzODAtdG8tdGVzdC1oeWRyb2dlbi1jb21idXN0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with CFM International, a 50/50 joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, to collaborate on a hydrogen demonstration programme that will take flight around the middle of this decade.

The programme’s objective is to ground and flight test a direct combustion engine fueled by hydrogen, in preparation for entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft by 2035. The demonstration will use an A380 flying testbed equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks prepared at Airbus facilities in France and Germany. Airbus will also define the hydrogen propulsion system requirements, oversee flight testing, and provide the A380 platform to test the hydrogen combustion engine in cruise phase.

CFM International (CFM) will modify the combustor, fuel system, and control system of a GE Passport turbofan to run on hydrogen. The engine, which is assembled in the US, was selected for this program because of its physical size, advanced turbo machinery, and fuel flow capability. It will be mounted along the rear fuselage of the flying testbed to allow engine emissions, including contrails, to be monitored separately from those of the engines powering the aircraft. CFM will execute an extensive ground test program ahead of the A380 flight test.

“This is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,” Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer

“By leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.” said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer.

“Hydrogen combustion capability is one of the foundational technologies we are developing and maturing as part of the CFM RISE Program,” said Gaël Méheust, president & CEO of CFM. “Bringing together the collective capabilities and experience of CFM, our parent companies, and Airbus, we really do have the dream team in place to successfully demonstrate a hydrogen propulsion system.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.988753080368042}",neutral,0.988753080368042,0
"Airbus completes midair automatic refueling trials with Singapore's F-16, preps for tests with F-15 - Defense News","Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vc21yL3NpbmdhcG9yZS1haXJzaG93LzIwMjIvMDIvMTgvYWlyYnVzLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1taWRhaXItYXV0b21hdGljLXJlZnVlbGluZy10cmlhbHMtd2l0aC1zaW5nYXBvcmVzLWYtMTYtcHJlcHMtZm9yLXRlc3RzLXdpdGgtZi0xNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Airbus Defence and Space has completed the flight phase of refueling trials of the automatic air-to-air refueling system on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport with Singaporean F-16 fighters.

Speaking to Defense News at the Singapore Airshow, Jeronimo Amador, head of marketing for strategic air mobility at Airbus D&S, said the next phase will see Republic of Singapore Air Force F-15SG Eagles and other tankers acting as receivers for the automatic air-to-air refueling system. The A3R system will then be certified by Spanish and Singaporean authorities once the second phase of flight trials is complete.

Amador said pandemic-related travel restrictions made it difficult to get the A3R system equipped to the MRTT aircraft — which is currently with Airbus in Europe — together with receivers to conduct trials.

Amador said the completed refueling trials saw Lockheed Martin-made F-16s in various configurations used by the Air Force successfully take advantage of the system. According to Airbus, the A3R system is intended to reduce the workload of air refueling operators, improve safety and optimize the rate of air-to-air refueling transfer in operational conditions.

The A3R system automatically flies the boom and maintains alignment between the boom tip and the receiver receptacle with an accuracy of a couple of centimeters. Alignment and receiver stability is checked in real time to keep a safe distance between the boom and the receiver, and to determine the optimum moment to extend the telescopic beam to achieve the connection with the receiver before fuel transfer is initiated.

Once the fuel transfer is completed and the disconnection is commanded between the two aircraft, the boom is cleared away from the receiver by retracting the telescopic beam and flying the boom away to keep a safe separation distance. During this process, the air refueling operator simply monitors the operation.

The A3R system is a key plank of the Smart MRTT program, for which Singapore became the launch customer in 2020 to equip its Air Force’s six MRTT aircraft. Other features of the program involve an enhanced vision system for nighttime covert operations involving the hose and drogue; improved sensors to capture more data; and predictive maintenance.

Amador told Defense News that the A3R system will be an option for new-build MRTTs and as an upgrade for existing operators, with the only significant piece of hardware being a computer needed for high-resolution image processing of video feeds from cameras monitoring the boom.

Several existing and future operators of the A330 have shown interest in the A3R system, according to Amador, who noted that any receiver aircraft that uses the boom and receptacle refueling method can be qualified for the system.

Australia, which operates seven MRTTs, locally known as KC-30As, remains interested in the A3R program. It was the first country to sign an agreement with Airbus to develop the A3R system in 2017. The company is awaiting a decision by the country on how to introduce the Smart MRTT enhancements into its fleet.

Airbus also sees potential for more sales of the MRTT to new and current Indo-Pacific customers, with Amador noting that the aircraft has performed in strategic transport missions in addition to that of a tanker.

South Korea also flies four MRTTs. The aircraft type from all three Indo-Pacific operators took part in the evacuation of Kabul as the Taliban were taking back control of Afghanistan in August 2021.

Elsewhere in the region, India and Indonesia also have outstanding requirements for large tanker aircraft. Airbus has kicked off development of fully autonomous automatic air-to-air refueling, or A4R, operations for the MRTT.

Cross-defaults led to Airbus cancellation of Qatar A321neo order - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8xOC9jcm9zcy1kZWZhdWx0cy1sZWQtdG8tYWlyYnVzLWNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi1vZi1xYXRhci1hMzIxbmVvLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Feb. 18, 2022, © Leeham News: Qatar Airways was in default of its Airbus contracts, allowing the OEM to cancel the orders for two A350-1000s and 50 A321neos, say people familiar with how these things work.

In a court filing last month, Airbus directly made this assertion.

The moves by Airbus over several weeks to cancel the orders from a major customer that is not in financial distress is unheard of.

Qatar and Airbus are embroiled in a very public dispute over flaking paint on A350s owned by Qatar that now is the subject of lawsuits in a London court. The airline seeks nearly $700m in damages. Qatar claims the flaking paint is a safety issue, backed by the government regulator that grounded 23 A350s. Airbus, and its governing regulator, EASA, say no safety issue is at stake.

Airbus offered to repaint the airplanes and provide compensation, say people familiar with the situation. The compensation was unacceptable to Qatar Airways, they say.

Defaults and cross-defaults

LNA is told that Qatar almost certainly suspended progress payments during the dispute. It was unknown if this was for the A321neos or A350s or both. Qatar has said it was current on its obligations for the A321neos. But it also said in a court filing it wasn’t obligated to accept delivery of any more A350s due to the dispute.

“Qatar also alleges that one consequence of the…alleged defect(s) in the A350 (which, as noted above, are denied) – is that Qatar is not obliged to accept delivery of new aircraft by virtue of clause 8 and/or clause 12 of the [purchase contract]. Airbus’ position is that this is wrong and that Qatar is in clear default of its contractual obligations in relation to two A350 aircraft that Airbus has tendered for delivery,” a London court wrote on Jan. 19.

When Airbus tendered two A350-1000s for delivery, Qatar refused to accept them. This triggered a default, allowing Airbus to cancel these two orders, Airbus said in a court filing, cited in the Jan. 19 court document.

“On 17 January 2022, Airbus served notice on Qatar to terminate its obligation to deliver one of those A350 aircraft and also exercised its right to terminate a separate contract with Qatar for the delivery of A321 aircraft pursuant to a cross-default provision in the [purchase contract]. Airbus anticipates that this will give rise to a further issue between the parties as to whether it was entitled to terminate and, if so, what losses Airbus can recover from Qatar as a result of the termination.

In court Feb. 18, Qatar characterized the A321neo cancellation as a “hand grenade” thrown by Airbus, Reuters reported.

Qatar Airways did not respond to a request for comment. Airbus declined comment.
