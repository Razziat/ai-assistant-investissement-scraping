Airbus and Boeing Report December and Full-Year 2018 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMTkvMDEvMTUvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LWRlY2VtYmVyLWFuZC1mdWxsLXllYXItMjAxOC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing wins 2018 orders race as Airbus nearly catches up on deliveries

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

The highlight of Airbus’ December order haul was the 100 A320neo family jets booked by Avolon, including 75 A320neos and 25 A321neos. Avolon is a major aircraft leasing company based in Dublin, Ireland. While Airbus scored an impressive 367 net new orders in December, Boeing finished the year 146 orders ahead and bested its European rival for the first time since 2011. Source: Airbus SAS

Boeing and Airbus both had a very strong month and delivered 102 and 127 commercial jets in December 2018, respectively, compared to 83 and 127 deliveries in the same month last year. For Boeing this marked a new all-time monthly delivery record, while Airbus tied its own record high set in December 2017. For the full-year 2018, Airbus almost closed its American rival’s lead by delivering 800 jets vs. Boeing’s 806. Airbus was successful in meeting its full-year target, while Boeing narrowly missed its own target of 810-815 deliveries. In 2017, Boeing delivered 763 jets (748 in 2016), with Airbus handing over 718 (688 in 2016).

In December 2018, Boeing delivered 69 737s (of which 51 were 737 MAXs), well above the current monthly rate of 52 jets. The company also delivered 11 767s, five 777s, and an impressive 17 787s. On December 13, Boeing celebrated the 787th 787 Dreamliner delivery. Boeing delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and plans a further increase to 57 737s per month in 2019. When asked about the potential for a 2020 production hike, Boeing stated in September 2018 that the market can support a production rate higher than 57 per month. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017.

In December 2018, Airbus delivered eight A220s, an impressive 93 A320s (27 ceo / 66 neo), 12 A330s, and 12 A350s. Airbus also shipped two A380s. Airbus performed an impressive comeback in the second half of 2018 after the company was trailing its 2017 deliveries by as many as 19 jets in May. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. By mid-2019, Airbus expects to be delivering 60 A320 jets per month on average. The company has internally been debating rates above 60 aircraft. Airbus delivered 93 A350s in 2018, up from 78 in 2017, and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month in 2019. The ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate means that the company has almost closed Boeing’s deliveries lead and could surpass its top rival in 2019.

With 203 net new orders in December, Boeing had a very strong month in the orders race. Boeing logged 216 gross orders (minus 13 cancellations => net of 203). The company booked six orders for a total of 194 737 MAX narrowbodies, including 125 for a single unidentified customer. Other December bookings worthy of mention were two orders for a total of four 747-8 freighters, five orders for a combined eight 777-300ERs and 10 777Fs, and a single 787-9 for Boeing Capital Corporation and one KC-767J tanker for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The JASDF already operates four KC-767J tankers as well as four Boeing E-767 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. For the full-year 2018, Boeing managed to book 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

With 392 gross orders, Airbus boasted an impressive number of bookings in December (25 cancellations => net of 367). Four customers placed orders for a total of 251 A320neo family jets. Avolon ordered 75 A320neos and 25 A321neos, while one unidentified customer placed an order for 80 A320neos and another for 50 A320neos plus 17 A321neos. Also, Airbus booked a slew of orders for its A220 model (formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries), including 60 A220-300s for JetBlue Airways and another 60 for Moxy, a new U.S. startup airline established by JetBlue cofounder David Neeleman. The firm order was preceded by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with Airbus at the Farnborough International Airshow on July 17, 2018. Moxy’s A220s are expected to be delivered from 2021. Also in December, Delta firmed up orders for 15 A220-300s, and an unidentified customer ordered three A350-900s and one A350-1000. With 380 net new orders during the first 11 months of 2018, Airbus nearly booked the same number of orders in December alone. For the full-year 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race to Boeing with its 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On December 31, 2018, Airbus set a new all-time order backlog record, boasting 7,577 jets on its books (of which 6,536, or 86%, are A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies). Airbus’ previous backlog record of 7,464 aircraft was set in July 2018 thanks to the addition of the A220 (formerly the Bombardier CSeries). By the end of 2018, Boeing’s backlog was 5,951 aircraft (of which 4,763, or 80%, are 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets). Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.5 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.4 years. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11 (0.98 as of November), with Airbus at 0.93 (0.56 as of November). In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

Airbus achieves new commercial aircraft delivery record in 2018 - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMS1haXJidXMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtbmV3LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVsaXZlcnktcmVjb3JkLWluLTIwMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Deliveries total 800 aircraft, 11 percent higher than in 2017

Net orders total 747, backlog increases to 7,577 aircraft

Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) delivered 800 commercial aircraft to 93 customers in 2018, meeting its full year delivery guidance and setting a new company record. Deliveries were 11 percent higher than the previous record of 718 units, set in 2017. For the 16th year in a row now, Airbus has increased the number of commercial aircraft deliveries on an annual basis.



In total, the 2018 commercial aircraft deliveries comprise:

20 A220s (since it became part of the Airbus family in July 2018);

626 A320 Family (vs 558 in 2017), of which 386 were A320neo Family (vs 181 NEOs in 2017);

49 A330s (vs 67 in 2017) including the first three A330neo in 2018;

93 A350 XWBs (vs 78 in 2017);

12 A380s (vs 15 in 2017).

In terms of sales, Airbus achieved 747 net orders during 2018 compared with 1,109 net orders in 2017. At the end of 2018, the backlog of Airbus commercial aircraft reached a new industry record and stood at 7,577 aircraft, including 480 A220s, compared with 7,265 at the end of 2017.

“Despite significant operational challenges, Airbus continued its production ramp-up and delivered a record number of aircraft in 2018. I salute our teams around the globe who worked until the end of the year to meet our commitments,” said Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “I am equally pleased about the healthy order intake as it shows the underlying strength of the commercial aircraft market and the trust our customers are placing in us. My gratitude goes out to all of them for their ongoing support.” He added: “As we look to further increase our industrial efficiency, we will continue making the digitalisation of our business a key priority.”

Over the last 16 years, Airbus has steadily increased its production year-by-year with the final assembly lines in Hamburg, Toulouse, Tianjin and Mobile complemented by the addition of the A220 line in Mirabel, Canada, during 2018. A notable contribution to Airbus’ delivery increase in 2018 came from the final assembly lines in the US and China. For the top-selling A320 Family in particular, the Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Mobile, Alabama, saw its 100th delivery, and is now producing in excess of four units per month. Meanwhile, Airbus’ “FAL Asia” in Tianjin, China, achieved its 400th A320 delivery, while in Germany Airbus commenced operations of its new, fourth production line in Hamburg. Overall, the A320 programme is on track to achieve rate 60 per month for the A320 Family by mid-2019. The Airbus teams successfully reached an important industrial milestone for the A350, achieving the targeted rate of 10 aircraft per month.

Airbus will report Full Year 2018 financial results on 14 February 2019.

Footnote:

The Full-Year 2018 net orders and backlog represent the contractual view. The Full-Year 2018 backlog value will be measured under IFRS 15 and will reflect the recoverable amount of revenues under these contracts. A significant reduction in order backlog value is expected mainly due to the adjustment for net prices versus list prices. The FY 2017 backlog will not be restated.

The duopoly doesn't have many competitors, but overseas competition is brewing. China's state-run company, COMAC, is poised to make waves in the aviation manufacturing industry, but some say not for a couple decades.

European airplane maker Airbus admitted yesterday a data breach of its ""Commercial Aircraft business"" information systems that allowed intruders to gain access to some of its employees' personal information.Though the company did not elaborate on the nature of the hack, it claimed that the security breach did not affect its commercial operations. So, there's no impact on aircraft production.Airbus confirmed that the attackers unauthorized accessed some data earlier this month, which the plane manufacturer claimed was ""mostly professional contact and IT identification details of some Airbus employees in Europe.""""Investigations are ongoing to understand if any specific data was targeted; however we do know some personal data was accessed,"" Airbus said in its press release published on Wednesday.After detecting the security breach, the plan manufacturer started an investigation to determine the origin of the hack and to understand the full scope of the data breach and if any specific data was targeted.The company has begun taking ""immediate and appropriate actions to reinforce existing security measures,"" which were not enough to keep the hackers out of their systems, ""and to mitigate its potential impact"" so that it can prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.The company has also instructed its employees to ""take all necessary precautions going forward,"" to strengthen their security defenses.Airbus also said it was in contact with the relevant regulatory authorities and the data protection authorities pursuant to the European Union's new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules.Airbus is the world's second-largest manufacturers of commercial airplanes, after Boeing which was also hit by a cyber attack (a variant of the infamous WannaCry ransomware ) in March last year that ""affected a small number of systems"" with no impact on production."
Airbus makes room for the A220 in Alabama and beyond - The Air Current,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvYWlyYnVzLW1ha2VzLXJvb20tZm9yLXRoZS1hMjIwLWluLWFsYWJhbWEtYW5kLWJleW9uZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This post is also available in: 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified))

As the shovels hit a loose patch of dirt in Mobile, Ala. at Airbus’s U.S. final assembly site, it’s increasingly clear that the company is doing more than just making space to build more A220s. The company is making room in its product strategy for the adopted airliner with a slate of concepts on the drawing board.

Airbus officially broke ground Wednesday on a new stateside assembly line for the Canadian single-aisle seven months after it completed the deal with Bombardier to add the program to its product line up. The new space will eventually build a maximum of four A220s each month, should demand from U.S. carriers warrant.

Airbus today is focused on accelerating production profitably, but Guillaume Faury, the company’s incoming chief executive, said that its long-standing strategy of evolving its products would eventually push it toward larger and more fuel efficient third member of the A220 family, dubbed externally as the A220-500.

“It is very likely, that once the A220 has done the ramp up and is economically viable — and that’s the challenge we have ahead of us — then we can further invest and grow the product and this is going to happen,” he said."

But some quick thinking on the part of Airbus mitigated the procurement issues, according to Airbus management.

Now owned by Safran, Zodiac is a key supplier to the A220, providing an interior package that includes bins, galleys, monuments, lavatories, linings, lighting, seats, the waste system and other elements.

But procurement challenges arose for the program which was then known as the Bombardier C Series. In July 2018, Aviation Week reported that quality issues with some Zodiac components led to production-line bottlenecks, forcing Bombardier to outsource some of the interiors installation work to Montreal-based Avianor to help keep aircraft moving.

Once Airbus got involved after acquiring a majority stake in the program, it “did exactly the same” as it did when faced with Zodiac-focused issues on the A350 widebody program, Airbus head of A220 program Florent Massou explained today during an Airbus North America media briefing in Mirabel, where the A220 is assembled. Airbus employees who had been tasked with helping Zodiac recover on the A350 were immediately assigned to the A220, said Massou.

Ramping up is always difficult, he noted, and Zodiac “did struggle”. But thanks to the switchover of talent, Airbus was able to help Zodiac quicken the pace and “make sure they would recover”.

So Airbus was able to leverage its experience on the A350 to aid the A220 program, and as a result the A220 is “currently benefitting a lot”. Some 33 A220s were delivered last year. Without this Airbus initiative, “it would have been a much more painful exercise”, said Massou.

A total 57 A220s are now in service. Airbus also reported today that the A220 has received 180-minute extended operations (ETOPS) approval from the Canadian civil aviation authority, Transport Canada. Certification covers the two A220 variants – the A220-100 and -300.

“In addition, the engine has FAA ETOPS certification for Part 33,” said head of A220 engineering & customer support Robert Dewar.

FAA and EASA ETOPS certifications for the A220 are pending.

When it comes to passenger experience, modern planes are legitimate marvels. Quiet enough to talk with a whisper and filled with lighting schemes capable of helping to reduce the effects of jet lag, they’re absolutely worth seeking out. When you look at the creme de la creme, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or Airbus A350, there are little things too, like extra large overhead bins, or bathrooms where you can actually turn around. There’s just one thing that might be missing: enough space for crews to work and rest comfortably. Many airlines are taking delivery of their first Airbus A350’s in 2019, and while passengers can’t wait to experience the upgraded spaces, cabin crews rarely feel the same…

One of the amusing parts of flying around the world on planes almost as frequently as the flight crews themselves is that you get to spend a lot of time in galleys stretching your legs. Side note: it’s very important and you should do it every five hours or more. These days, after the small talk about how long they get in the given city and if they have any favorite destinations – all of which I do genuinely enjoy by the way – we usually get onto the topic of favorite planes. Many crews do have a love of aviation, and I love that. One thing most tend to hate though: new planes. Great for cashing in their standby flights, not so great to do long haul service on. The A350 is the plane that’s most fun to get cabin crew members started (ranting) on.

The Airbus A350 is a true triumph from a passenger perspective and airline revenue managers love it too. It’s wide enough to fit as many seats as almost any other plane, with more height from passenger to ceiling than any other, which creates a true sense of air, space and comfort. Even packed like a sardine in economy, it feels better; and when the cool lights turn on, you feel like you’re in Star Trek, rather than Leslie Nielsen classic “Airplane”. It’s the only plane where I can talk without raising my voice even slightly. More importantly, the natural feel of cabin pressure and humidity make you feel as good as one can reasonably expect, while zooming through the skies at 40,000 feet in a composite tube. I actually seek it out whenever possible. It’s that good. At the same time, crews tend to hate it.

Here are 10 reasons it’s legitimately cool.

As the small talk draws on, you realize that on the A350 you’re in closer proximity to the person you’re talking to than in most planes, and that actually, hang on a minute, there’s hardly any crew workspace at all. It’s hard to fathom where meals can be adequately prepared, let alone where a crew member could read magazines behind a curtain. Crews I’ve spoken to who take real pride in their work tend to remark that properly plating or staging for a meal is downright difficult in the Airbus A350. And that lack of galley space is not even taking into account the crew rest areas, those secret compartments where cabin crew “on break” can go lay down and refresh.

According to Airbus, the A350 is the world’s first plane where crew rest areas “have no revenue generating impact”. In normal speak: these crew areas aren’t somewhere that could otherwise be making the airline money as cargo or passenger seats. Airbus chose to put these rest areas in the crown, which is basically the roof of the plane, similar to the way Boeing creates rest areas. But unlike many rest areas of days past, they’re smaller and harder to get to.

Again: this plane was built to create as many areas as possible where paying passengers can sit, with the least possible impact taken by things like ovens and jump seats. Crews tend to love Boeing 777-300ER bunks as well as Airbus A380 bunks, but generally despise the cramped bunks found on the Airbus A350, even compared to direct modern competitor the Boeing 787. The next time you board an Airbus A350, and I hope you get the chance to, be sure to ask how your crew enjoys it. Chances are they’ll say “nice for you, sucks for us”."

AIDT’S CONTRIBUTION

AIDT has already played a major role in helping Airbus assemble and train a workforce at the company’s only U.S. manufacturing facility. In 2014, AIDT, part of the Alabama Department of Commerce, opened a $7 million training facility near the Airbus campus in Mobile.

“The addition of the new Airbus A220 family of aircraft in Mobile is proof that Alabama is well positioned with its workforce training to meet the needs of manufacturers all over the world,” said Ed Castile, director of AIDT and deputy secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“AIDT has worked with Airbus since the beginning, and we’re honored to continue our support,” he added. “Congratulations to Airbus and Bombardier, we’re proud that they chose to build this next-generation aircraft here.”

Airbus and Canada’s Bombardier finalized plans last year to form a joint venture to produce Bombardier’s C Series passenger jet, now called the Airbus A220.

The new A220 production facility will be located at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley industrial complex, adjacent to Airbus’ A320 Family production line. It will build aircraft for U.S.-based customers.

The assembly line, which will create more jobs and further strengthen the aerospace industry, is part of Airbus’ strategy to enhance its global competitiveness by meeting the growing needs of its customers in the United States and elsewhere.

A220 aircraft assembly is planned to start in 2019, using a combination of the existing and expanded Airbus facilities at Brookley.

A groundbreaking ceremony for the new facility is planned for next week. Birmingham’s HPM was selected as program manager for the construction project, according to a November announcement.

HPM served as program manager for Airbus’ $600 million project to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Mobile, with work beginning in 2013. Airbus delivered its first Alabama-made A321 aircraft in 2016.

For the first wave of hiring, the company prefers candidates to have at least two years of experience in aerospace/aviation production.

Airbus said some candidates for the new Alabama jobs will also have the opportunity for on-the-job training with the company’s manufacturing team in Mirabel, Canada, before returning to Mobile.

Production on the first A220 aircraft is expected to start in the third quarter."

How Airbus handles IoT network traffic in manufacturing - ComputerWeekly.com,"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXB1dGVyd2Vla2x5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1MjQ1NjUyMi9Ib3ctQWlyYnVzLWhhbmRsZXMtSW9ULW5ldHdvcmstdHJhZmZpYy1pbi1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is using internet of things (IoT) technology from HPE to support its assembly of aircraft.

During manufacturing, thousands of rivets are used to attach panels to an airframe, and the panels need to be drilled and fastened in a very particular way. Riveting must be done in the right order and the correct torque settings used for torque wrenches.

Airbus has estimated that it drills 120 million holes a year for fastening aircraft panels, and only 25% of this activity is automated. That means 75% of the work has to be done by human operators.

The assembly process involves drilling, riveting and then applying sealant to prevent corrosion. Sébastien Boria, mechatronics and robotics technology leader at Airbus, says: “These are the most critical activities in assembly. At the end of the day, humans are not predictable. They take a decision that will have an impact further down the production line.”

The manual processes for drilling and fastening panels requires tools to be configured with very specific settings, and panels must be fastened to the airframe in a consistent way.

If a tool operator works at a station on the aircraft production line for an eight-hour shift, but the panel being fastened takes 12 hours to finish, the work needs to be passed on to another operator.

Boria says there is a potential problem at the hand-over interface between the end of the first operator’s shift and what is then communicated to the next operator, who has to carry on where the first operator left off.

If the second operator then takes over, but works in the wrong way and the work needs to be redone, this could prove very expensive, says Boria. The answer is to monitor the work each operator does in near real time, so that production errors can be corrected immediately.

Latency can stop production Today, the tools used by operators working on an aircraft’s construction have sensors. Typically, IoT applications deploy sensors at the so-called edge, onto physical devices, which then feed data back to a centralised control and feedback system, which acts like a supervisor. Boria says: “If you consider network communications, your IoT application may work in a proof of concept, but then you need to scale on the factory floor.” This is where problems are discovered, he says. “If you have infinite bandwidth, then you can have thin clients and a strong back-end,” says Boria. “But real life on the factory floor is clearly different from theory. You cannot stop production due to network disconnection or an issue with Active Directory. We need to avoid these issues.” Read more about edge computing SDN and edge computing can work together to apply data-processing decisions that make better use of network links and bandwidth, especially when it comes to edge versus cloud.

As IoT devices proliferate, cloud just isn’t fast enough. But that is exactly where edge computing comes in, enabling analysis at speeds the future demands. The IoT application in a centralised architecture assumes it will always have a network connection. It depends on a reliable network supporting hundreds of operators using tools with sensors, all operating at the same radio frequency. The tools will all be sending data to the back-end system simultaneously, and this is likely to cause a network contention issue at some point, says Boria. He thinks developers should consider network communications as a scarce resource. “If you assume you will have 5G and high bandwidth, then your applications will have problems with latency,” he says. It takes a finite amount of time to send data over the network to the back-end system, leading to potential problems when data is lost or arrives late, says Boria. The typical way to overcome latency problems is to add more bandwidth, he adds."

The assembly line will satisfy the strong and growing U.S. demand for the A220 aircraft, the newest offering in Airbus’ commercial aircraft product line.



Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus, and Guillaume Faury, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft led the celebration and welcomed approximately 700 attendees including Airbus and other industry executives, Airbus manufacturing employees, state and national dignitaries, and local community leaders.

The new assembly line, which is the company’s second U.S.-based commercial aircraft production facility, will be located at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley adjacent to the A320 Family production line and will facilitate assembly of A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft for U.S. customers. Aircraft production is planned to begin in Q3 2019; with first delivery of a Mobile-assembled A220 aircraft scheduled for 2020. The new A220 production facilities will be complete by next year.

Airbus has strong and longstanding ties to the United States, with Airbus aircraft being operated by the largest airlines in America. Additionally, Airbus is a major partner of U.S. aerospace companies and workers. In the last three years, Airbus spent $48 billion in the United States with hundreds of U.S. suppliers in more than 40 states, translating into Airbus support of more than 275,000 American jobs. Among its facilities in the U.S. Airbus has: engineering centers in Kansas and Alabama; a major training facility in Florida and soon one in Colorado; materials support and headquarters in Virginia; an A320 Family assembly line delivering aircraft in Alabama; an innovative think tank (A3) in California; a drone data analysis business (Airbus Aerial) in Atlanta, Georgia; helicopter manufacturing and assembly facilities in Texas and Mississippi; and a satellite manufacturing facility (OneWeb) in Florida.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and true widebody comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. With a range of up to 3,200 nm (5920 km), the A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft.

With an order book of more than 500 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

Airbus wins DARPA contract to develop small constellation satellite bus for Blackjack program - Airbus,"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMS1haXJidXMtd2lucy1kYXJwYS1jb250cmFjdC10by1kZXZlbG9wLXNtYWxsLWNvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb24tc2F0ZWxsaXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HERNDON, Va., USA, 14 January 2019 - Airbus Defense and Space Inc. has been awarded a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a satellite bus in support of the Blackjack program.

DARPA describes the Blackjack program as an architecture demonstration intending to show the military utility of global low-earth orbit constellations and mesh networks of lower size, weight and cost. DARPA wants to buy commercial satellite buses and pair them with military sensors and payloads. The bus drives each satellite by generating power, controlling attitude, providing propulsion, transmitting spacecraft telemetry, and providing general payload accommodation including mounting locations for the military sensors.

“Airbus has previously co-invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high-rate manufacturing technology and supply chain logistics to build large constellations of small satellites,” said Tim Deaver, Director of US Space Programs at Airbus Defense and Space, Inc. “Airbus is committed to growing manufacturing capability in the US and our government customers can leverage this commercial capability to develop low-earth orbit constellations to complement large existing systems.”

This contract positions Airbus Defense and Space, Inc., of Herndon, Va., and its strategic joint venture partner, OneWeb Satellites, of Exploration Park, Fl., as the ideal service providers for Blackjack.

High production rates and design-to-cost management techniques enable OneWeb Satellites to offer low cost constellation solutions for the U.S. government and current customers. Constellations of inexpensive satellites permit wide scale disaggregated architectures enhancing survivability across many different mission areas.

OneWeb Satellites is pioneering new value propositions in space. They are leading the design and manufacturing of ultra-high performing satellites at high-volumes.

“We have created a game changer with our overall design, supply chain and production system,” said Tony Gingiss, CEO, OneWeb Satellites. “Our team is transforming the space industry and we are in the midst of demonstrating we can deliver on our promises.”

OneWeb Satellites brings to bear capabilities which dramatically lower the cost and shorten acquisition timelines for customers thanks to a modular design and agile serial production of satellites.

The OneWeb Satellites satellite manufacturing facility in Florida is the latest step in Airbus’ continued and long-standing commitment to growth in U.S. manufacturing, job creation and investment.

This facility, which will ultimately support thousands of jobs and follows the opening of our U.S. Manufacturing Facility for A320 aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, from which we delivered our first aircraft in 2016. An A220 assembly line on the same site in Alabama will break ground in January of 2019.

With our extensive network of U.S. suppliers, Airbus is the largest consumer of U.S. aerospace and defense goods in the world – buying more than any other company or even country. Airbus invested $16.5 billion with U.S. companies in 2017, supporting 275,000 American jobs.

Mirabel, Québec — Getting Airbus A350s out the door on time in Toulouse had to happen before A220s could follow a continent away.

Airbus’s new head of the A220 program said Monday that after hammering out issues on its new twin-aisle at interior supplier Zodiac, now part of supersupplier Safran, the embedded team quickly shifted focus.

Airbus had a full A350 team at Zodiac, at the same production facilities that fed the A220 project. “Basically coming in we leveraged exactly the same guys over there — we did it for the A350 — they switched to the A220 to ease the ramp up on the A220,” said Florent Massou on Monday during the during the company’s first open house since Airbus took over 50.01% of the rebranded A220 program on July 1.

Airbus and Bombardier managed 33 A220 deliveries in 2018, below Bombardier’s forecast, but marked a sharp increase in the second half (20 aircraft vs. 13), to which Massou attributed to that work with Zodiac. “Otherwise it would’ve been a much more painful exercise.”

It’s a prime example, said Airbus’s new leadership of the program, of how it is throwing its weight behind its new strategic leverage to industrialize the A220 program. With its takeover, Airbus now manages Bombardier’s Mirabel final assembly line and the more than 100 Tier One suppliers that deliver structures, components and systems for each aircraft."

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian announced on Tuesday that the debut of the airline's brand new Airbus A220 jets will likely be delayed due to the government shutdown.

Bastian and Delta COO Gil West told reporters and industry analysts on its fourth quarter 2018 earnings call that certifications of new aircraft types can't be completed with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors furloughed amid the government shutdown.

Since Delta is the first US airline to operate the A220, formerly known as the Bombardier C Series, federal regulators must certify everything from its safety systems to its seats before the jet can carry passengers.

It's unclear how much of a delay the shutdown has caused. The potential delay in the debut of the A220 is not likely to cause major operational issues the airline said. It will, however, disappoint the aviation fans who purchased tickets on its launch flight.

According to West, the shutdown could also affect the certification of Delta's incoming fleet of Airbus A330-900neo widebody airliners; another aircraft type for which Delta is the US launch customer. However, the Delta COO explained that the shutdown is not expected to have an immediate impact on the A330neo, but could be problematic downstream if it persists.

"Look at entire portfolio when investing in sub-types, Airbus and Boeing say - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 23 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wMS8yMy9sb29rLWF0LWVudGlyZS1wb3J0Zm9saW8td2hlbi1pbnZlc3RpbmctaW4tc3ViLXR5cGVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9lb2luZy1zYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jan. 23, 2019, © Leeham News, Dublin: Investors and lessors should take into account the entire product line offered by Airbus and Boeing when considering sub-types that may have few sales to date, officials of the two companies said at the annual conference in Dublin organized by Airfinance Journal.

Tim Myers, president of Boeing Capital Corp., and Mark Pearman-Wright, Head of Leasing & Investor Marketing for Airbus, said the 737-7, 737-9, 737-10, A319neo, A321LR, A330-800 and the new 777X should be looked at in context of the entire 737, A320, A330 and 777 lines when making investment decisions.

Slow-selling airplanes

The 737 line is dominated by the 737-8, Myer said. The other models have not sold as well. Although Myers declined to provide sales numbers, LNA previously reported that based on public announcements and customer company documents, about 70 737-7s have been ordered.

Based on public announcements by Boeing and customers, including order swaps to the MAX 10, about 250 MAX 9 orders were outstanding going into the fourth quarter last year. Using the same sources, MAX 10 orders numbers between 550-575.

Boeing has a huge backlog of Unidentified customers with unspecified MAX orders that could inflate any of these numbers.

At Airbus, there are only 55 orders for the A319neo at Dec. 31.

The A330-800 has only a handful of orders.

Investors and lessors typically like broad customer bases and “liquidity” (ie, a large number of airplanes in service or on order) of types and sub-types as investment opportunities.

Niche airplanes like the 777-8, which won’t enter service until 2022, the 777LR, the A350-900ULR and the A321LR, likewise fall within limited appeal for investors.

Then there is the Airbus A220, which until last July was the Bombardier C Series. Bombardier’s own poor financial cast a cloud over obtaining orders and gave pause to some lessors to acquire the aircraft through a direct order or via purchase-leaseback (PLB).

Looking at the bigger picture

Pearman-Wright noted that some C Series had been financed for Air Baltic through PLBs (Nordic Aviation Capital, for example).

“We’ve certainly [seen] much more interest” since the Airbus purchase of 50.01% of the program, he said. “We clearly have more lessor interest now. The Air Baltic sale/leaseback was oversubscribed. Bringing it into the Airbus stable, the investors appreciate that.”

The MAX family must be viewed as a whole when investors consider which models to put money into, Myers said.

The MAX 10, a program launched at the Paris Air Show in 2017, now represents about 12% of the 737 MAX backlog with some 550+ orders. In lessor terms, this is a small number. The MAX 9 is about half this and the MAX 7 a fraction.

The MAX 10 EIS is next year; the MAX 7 enters service this year.

“When you look at the MAX family, one of the things you have to look at is how we provide the whole gamut and meet our customers’ needs,” Myers said. “The heart of the market is really the Dash 8. There will be investments in the 9. There will be investments in the 10. When you look at the Max family, you have to look at the whole array.

“What’s out in the investor base today, you have a lot of people trying to differentiate themselves.”

(One such lessor is Altavair, when while yet to invest in the MAX family has acquired 737-900ERs and the 777LR, two limited-appeal aircraft sub-types.)

“If you go for bid on the 737-8, you probably will have 35 or 40 offers. That won’t necessarily be true for some of the other product types that may be viewed as more of a challenge in the investor base.”

Pearman-Wright said that the operator base for the A319 and A330-200 is broad and both airplanes sold well.

The retirement age of the aircraft will begin to create a wave shortly into the next decade, when he sees sales of the upgraded neo versions taking off.

Versality will help sales of the A319neo and A330-800, he said. The ranges of each aircraft allows long operations while these aircraft also serve shorter routes.

“The investor community has to look at the A319neo and what it does in its niche,” he said.

The 330-800 will replace the 330-200, with a replacement wave to come. “It’s the cheapest, most versatile airplane you can acquire,” he said of the -800.

Myers said the MAX 7 has hot-high, longer range and somewhat less capacity than the MAX 8 and will find its own use. “That’s just as true for the MAX 9 and the MAX 10,” he said.

“As an investor, you have to look at the whole MAX family and how it will be used,” Myer said.

New designs

The 777X has less than 350 orders with about a dozen customers, but 72% of the orders are concentrated with the three Big 3 Middle East airlines.

Myers again said that investors have to look at the entire 777 line, with a replacement wave beginning in 2021-23.

Boeing-Embraer

Myers said the Embraer EJet is already a proven airplane and that Embraer has a long history of successful products.

The pending joint venture, in which Boeing will own 80% and EMB 20%, therefore is unlikely to provide the same investor boost to the EJet as did Airbus to the C Series.

This week, a brand new $300 million Airbus jetliner assembly plant broke ground in Mobile, Alabama and it's the culmination of a trade dispute Boeing launched with Canada nearly two years ago.

The dispute initiated with a trade complaint filed by Boeing in April 2017 alleged that Canadian government subsidies were used to harm its business in the US.

Here's how we got here

In 2004, Canada's Bombardier, the maker of private jets and small regional airliner, decided it was time to make the jump into the big leagues. It was time to build an advanced carbon composite jetliner to compete against the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. More specifically, the Canadian plane, dubbed the Bombardier C Series, would compete against the smaller variants of the cash cow Airbus A320-family and Boeing 737.

For the next decade, the story around the Bombardier C Series program was one of cost overruns, developmental delays, and slow sales. Bombardier reported a loss of $4.9 billion during the third quarter of 2015 including a $4.4 billion charge largely associated with the C Series program.

At the time of the announcement, Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare admitted that his company was ""overwhelmed"" by the multiple development programs in had on its plate.

A financially weakened Bombardier ended up taking a $1 billion bailout from the Quebec provincial government. In return, the provincial taxpayers took a 49.5% stake in the C Series.

Even though the first C Series prototype had taken to the air in 2013 and was soon earning critical acclaim for its performance capabilities, Bombardier still struggled to find a major airline willing to buy in bulk. Especially a major US airline.

Bombardier

In early 2016, Bombardier and Boeing went head-to-head in a competition for orders from United Airlines. Boeing won. United ordered 40 Boeing 737-700s in January of that year and an additional 25 in March. One industry analyst told Business Insider that Boeing gave United a 70% discount on the March order as a means to shut Bombardier out.

Bombardier's futility would finally end in April 2016 when it landed the sale it had long sought; an order for 75 C Series jets from Delta Air Lines.

It's the deal credited with saving the C Series program and it's the deal that set Boeing on the warpath.

Boeing's trade dispute

In April 2017, Boeing filed a complaint with US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission alleging that the Delta C Series order was only made possible abnormally low prices supported by Canadian government subsidies.

The US International Trade Commission agreed and in September of that year recommended a 219.63% tariff. A week later, the Commerce Department added another 79.82% tariff.

In total, Bombardier and Delta faced a 299.45% tariff on any Canadian-built C Series plane exported to the US.

Bombardier responded in a statement, calling the ruling ""absurd and divorced from reality."" The Montreal-based airplane manufacturer also hit out at Boeing, accusing it of manipulating US trade laws to stifle competition.

Bombardier and Delta both argued that Boeing's business couldn't have been hurt by the deal simply because Boeing didn't actually have a product in its lineup similar in capacity to the C Series.

""Boeing has no American-made product to offer because it canceled production of its only aircraft in this size range — the 717 — more than 10 years ago,"" Delta said in a statement at the time.

According to the Atlanta-based airline, Boeing's only proposed alternative to the CS100 was to offer it a batch of second-hand Brazilian Embraer E190 regional jets.

Facing the possibility of losing the most important order in the C Series program's history, Bombardier turned Boeing's greatest foe, Airbus.

Less than one month after the tariff was announced, Bombardier handed 50.01% of its prized airliner program to Airbus with zero upfront cash investment coming from the European aviation giant.

As part of the deal, Airbus announced that the C Series will also be produced at its assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Fortunately for Bombardier, the US International Trade Commission struck the down the proposed tariff in January 2018, ending the dispute.

The Alabama factory

By the summer of 2018, the Bombardier C Series was no more. It had been rebranded as the Airbus A220 and folded into the Airbus product lineup.

While many saw the proposal to build the Canadian jets in Alabama as a ploy to sway trade regulators. Airbus, as it turns out, was dead serious.

Fast forward to January 2019 as the CEO of Airbus and Bombardier along with the Governor Ivey of Alabama gathered on a sunny Wednesday to break ground for the A220 final assembly line in Mobile.

The $300 million-facility will assemble aircraft destined for the A220's North American customers such as Delta, and JetBlue. The first delivery from the Mobile factory is expected to be in 2020.

It's also the latest chapter in the long multinational saga that is the Bombardier C Series.

Airbus Helicopters to propose H135 for U.S. Navy AHTS - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLXByb3Bvc2UtaDEzNS1mb3ItdS1zLW5hdnktYWh0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is planning to submit a proposal to fulfill the U.S. Navy’s Advanced Helicopter Training System (AHTS) with a platform based on its H135 twin.

“The Navy has released a pre-solicitation notice, targeting an RFP (request for proposal) release on Jan. 22,” said Scott Tumpak, vice president, military programs at Airbus Helicopters, during a media visit to the company’s facilities in Columbus, Mississippi.

“We’re very confident that the H135 is the right aircraft for that mission. It [has a] glass cockpit, twin-engine, and has a four-axis autopilot – most similar to the Navy’s fleet aircraft.”

Already in use for military training by armed forces in countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Jordan and Japan, the proposed U.S. Navy-spec H135 will include a Helionix automatic flight control system (AFCS), FADEC-controlled Pratt & Whitney or Turbomeca twin turbines, and new high-lift main rotor blades.

“The H135 is already IFR [instrument flight rules] certified – which the customer requires to conduct their training missions – without any development needed,” said Tumpak. “We feel this gives us another advantage compared to the risk that may be there on some of the aircraft competing for this program.”

The U.S. military is already one of the largest operators of Airbus aircraft anywhere on the planet. The company has delivered over 600 machines to the U.S. Army, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Airbus plans to leverage its experience with the UH-72A Lakota for the AHTS program. Since 2006, it has delivered over 435 Lakotas, which are based on the EC145 civilian helicopter, to the U.S. Army. The twin-engine Lakota initially served as a liaison, utility, VIP and medevac machine for the Army, before taking on the primary rotary-wing training mission at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

If Airbus is awarded the AHTS program, 130 EC135s for the Navy will be built on the Columbus final assembly line, alongside the Lakota. The Mississippi facility also assembles H125s and handles the completions and deliveries for the full range of Airbus machines for North American customers.

Components for the UH-72As and H125s arrive from other Airbus Helicopters plants and suppliers and are assembled on two, multi-station lines, while machines destined for completion arrive mostly fabricated. Painting, pre-flight, and flight testing is also done at the factory.

Located at Columbus’ Golden Triangle Regional Airport, Airbus Helicopters has a team of over 200, of which nearly 40 percent are U.S. veterans.

All the wiring harnesses and circuit breaker panels for the Lakota and many of the harnesses for the H125 are manufactured in Columbus, and the facility is also an FAA Part 145 repair station, according to Mike Spears, vice president of industry for Airbus Helicopters.

“This is the industrial center of excellence for Airbus Helicopters in North America. We have what I believe is one of the best paint facilities in the U.S – it’s really state-of-the-art,” he said. “And we are capable of performing all test procedures on any and all aircraft which we touch here in Mississippi.”

Over 1,300 aircraft have been delivered since the facility opened in 2003, and Tumpak is confident that Airbus Helicopter’s past performance will be a positive factor for the U.S. Navy.

“I think our experience delivering every Lakota at cost and on time, as well as successfully supporting the aircraft for over 13 years, really gives us the understanding of how to do that mission.”"

Guillaume Faury will become the next CEO of Airbus Group in October. On Wednesday, Faury who served as the president of Airbus Helicopters from 2013 to 2018 gave us an outline of his vision for electric aircraft and urban air mobility.

""We think it's going to happen,"" Faury told reporters at the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mobile, Alabama. ""There's a convergence of a number of technologies and social needs that will make urban air mobility a reality.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

According to Faury, heavy surface congestion in megacities around the world is creating demand from certain segments of the population that are willing to pay a little more for the reliable and timely urban air transportation.

One of the elements of that will make urban air mobility work is electric propulsion.

""There is a development in electric technologies and battery technologies that are enabling short distance electric flight in an economical way,"" the current head Airbus Commerical Aircraft said.

In addition, Airbus sees the deployment of electric propulsion in urban mobility as a gateway for its future use in the company's large commercial and military aircraft.

However, when a financially feasible form of electric flight will actually become a reality remains to be seen.

""I would love to be able to answer this question,"" Faury replied to Business Insider when asked when we could expect electric-powered flight. ""There's still a lot to do.""

Batteries have an energy density of up to 500 watt-hours per kilogram while fuel boasts an energy density of 12,000 watt-hours per kilogram, he told us.

As a result, this means airplanes will have to carry a significantly larger number of batteries to match the amount of energy stored in aviation fuel.

""So before we go long distances we need to find other sources of energy,"" Faury said.

Other sources of energy such as hydrogen create storage issues, while hydrogen fuel cells create packaging problems.

""Hydrogen, today, we don't know how to store it so there are still big challenges,"" he said. ""If we put hydrogen fuel cells then you need to put stacks on board which means a lot of cooling.""

Fortunately, these challenges aren't insurmountable.

""We see a lot of challenges, none of them seems to be unmanageable,"" Faury said. ""Of course with technologies, it takes time."""

Connected buses will gather and transmit information in real time about the state of the national road network, as well as enabling communication with areas isolated due to natural disasters. It will also study the use of new technologies to provide internet access in rural areas. The initiative, supported by the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Peru (MTC), will be developed on the Andean road route between the capital city Lima, on the Pacific Coast, and cities located at the edge of the jungle and low Amazonian jungle.

Scientific data will be gathered with unprecedented precision, making it possible to map one of the most rugged – and busiest – sections of the country’s transport network, crossing the highest paved road in the central Andes, Ticlio, at a height of 4,818 metres above sea level.

Alberto Rodríguez, Director of the World Bank for Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, said: “It will only be possible to maintain growth in the coming decade if our countries invest in development of human resources and scientific capabilities. This pilot project aims to achieve this very goal, connecting people in an extremely difficult geographical region of Peru and helping them to identify problems and possible solutions relating to road safety, meteorology and transport logistics. By connecting people and their problems with research centres, universities and leading technological companies, the project is making a tangible contribution to development.”

Meanwhile, Christophe Roux, Head of Airbus Defence and Space in Latin America said: “The support shown by Peruvian institutions is also proof of Peru’s strong interest in technological innovation. Airbus is committed to supporting this development, especially taking into account that Digital Transformation is at the heart of our growth strategy.”

The first phase of the project will involve installation of satellite antennas and sensors on various commercial buses covering the 742 km coast-mountain-jungle route. The data gathered by these devices will be complemented by satellite images provided by the Peruvian Space Agency (CONIDA), one of the entities collaborating on the SmartBus project.

The second phase will involve the organisation of a hackathon in Lima from 15 to 17 February 2019, which will bring together engineers, developers and students from across Peru to work on the development of innovative digital services and solutions using the information gathered by these sensors.

The project will allow measurement of the impact of innovative technological solutions such as: access to new connectivity models; systematisation of data gathered via wireless applications for the monitoring of infrastructure and maintenance of road networks; and the updating of information relevant to business activities at a local level.

There is a major gap in Peru between urban and rural areas in terms of internet access. According to the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics (INEI), for every 100 households, 56.7 have internet access in the metropolitan area of Lima, 32.5 in other urban areas, and only 1.3 in rural areas (INEI, 2018). This pilot project will allow real-time access to meteorological and transport information, helping to mitigate the impact of recurring flooding on the local infrastructure and economy and promote adequate measures to prevent accidents and improve road safety.

SmartBus is one of the digital inclusion programmes currently being deployed by the World Bank with support from the Digital Development Partnership.

A number of companies are working together with Airbus, the MTC and the World Bank to implement the project. Kymeta and Aventior (both from the USA), Terabee (France) and the Peruvian companies TEPSA and Lequi Peru are all providing resources, together with the digital workshop Fab Lab Lima, the local branch of the Fab Foundation international network. The National University of Engineering is also participating in SmartBus through its Faculty of Civil Engineering and the National Telecommunications Research and Training Institute (INICTEL-UNI). Furthermore, the following stakeholders are taking part in this project through the Digital Development Partnership: Microsoft, GSMA, Finland, South Korea, Japan, UK and Denmark.

"Japan's ANA to order 30 Boeing, 18 Airbus planes - Phys.org","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTAxLWphcGFuLWFuYS1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDEtamFwYW4tYW5hLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ANA Holdings said it would buy 30 Boeing and 18 Airbus planes, citing growing demand in the region and increased inbound tourism to Japan

The operator of Japan's All Nippon Airways said Tuesday it has decided to order a total of 48 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for deliveries from 2021 through 2025.

ANA Holdings said it would buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes and 18 Airbus A320neo units, citing growing demand in the region and increased inbound tourism to Japan.

The company said the 30 Boeing jets would have a catalogue price of 383 billion yen ($3.5 billion), adding that the firm has so far confirmed orders for 20 units, with an option to buy 10 more.

The 18 Airbus orders are all confirmed, but the engines manufacturer is yet to be decided, the company said.

For now, the Airbus deal has a catalogue price of 166 billion yen, ANA Holdings said.

The deal makes ANA the first Japanese buyer of the Boeing model, while the Airbus A320neo already serves ANA's international routes.

The company praised the fuel efficiency of the two models.

Separately, the Japanese firm also said it will spend $95 million to buy 9.5 percent of PAL Holdings, which operates flag carrier Philippine Airlines.

""Asia is a key growth market and we believe Philippine Airlines is in an excellent operational position to capitalise on both the strong uptick in air traffic growth as well as the vibrant, expanding Philippine economy,"" ANA Holdings President Shinya Katanozaka said in a statement.

For nine months to December, ANA Holdings said its net profit dropped 30.2 percent to 106.8 billion yen.

The fall was due partly to comparison effects as the previous year saw special income related to making low-cost carrier Peach Aviation its subsidiary.

The company also paid $58 million to settle a class action lawsuit in the US related to an anti-trust allegation.

The firm's nine-month operating profit dropped 5.6 percent to 156.6 billion yen, while overall sales rose 5.2 percent to 1,568 billion yen.

Severe natural disasters in Japan as well as rising fuel prices also weighed on the firm's bottom line.

But generally strong demand for both domestic and international air travel was supporting the firm's financial performance, the company said.

The firm kept its annual forecasts for a net profit of 102 billion yen and an operating profit of 165 billion yen on sales of 2.04 trillion yen.

To those who don’t follow Airbus Americas closely, the Mississippi stop might be a puzzle. I’ll come back to this to explain why an international group of media, including me, made this trek.

Let’s start with Montreal.

A220 production

The principal reason, of course, of going to Montreal was to show off the A220 production line and talk about this program.

Many of the 50 or so journalists on the trip had been to the facilities when the airplane and buildings were branded C Series and Bombardier. Most had not been there.

But even those of us who had learned something new. As LNA reported last week, I confirmed that performance improvements are planned for the A220 that will further reduce operating costs. In the same post, LNA reported that the C Series/A220 proved to be 3% better than promised.

Something else, which wasn’t included: by shifting the aft lavs around, Airbus can put 2-3 more seats in the airplane, depending on the configuration change. This doesn’t sound like much, but depending on the average fare, load factor and flight segments per day, each seat generates hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue per year.

This is without reducing the seat pitch.

Airbus reset the ramp-up expectations. Bombardier originally planned to reach rate 10/mo by 2020. Airbus says this will come by 2025. (The Mobile A220 final assembly line will deliver its first A220 in mid-2020. Full production capacity is 4/mo.)

Space, Tanker, Defense

The Mirabel visit also included an overview of the previous Airbus Canada operations and the hopes for the future. This includes selling the Canadian government fighters and tankers and expanding its Canadian-sourcing for these, satellites and other aerospace products.

Airbus Helicopters

From Montreal, we flew by chartered Air Canada on an Airbus A319 to Columbus (MS), the production site for the Airbus Helicopter operation in the US.

Airbus has been selling choppers to the US Defense Department, Coast Guard, law enforcement, fire departments and private sectors for 50 years.

The Coast Guard helicopters are a familiar site, even if people didn’t recognize these as coming from Airbus. Used in rescue operations at sea and following natural disasters ashore, the closed tail rotor helicopter is an instantly recognizable aircraft.

The Columbus production line covers a variety of Airbus helicopter models.

One of the biggest success stories is the Lakota.

Airbus sold more than 450 to the US Army. It is used in training. In decades where defense programs are late and over budget, officials say each Lakota has been delivered on time and on budget.

Mobile A220 FAL

The charter flight from Columbus to Mobile, still Air Canada, was all of 36 minutes in the air. The flight landed at Mobile’s downtown Brookley Field, where Airbus’ plant is located, instead of the regional airport to the west. Brookley is a 10 minute drive to the central business district, compared with 30-40 minutes for the regional airport.

Mobile is opening Brookley to commercial service this year and shifting all from the regional airport within 4-5 years.

The groundbreaking was really ceremonial, with state, local, company officials and representatives from Delta, Jet Blue and Moxy airlines turning dirt with the classic silver shovels. The footprint for the final assembly line building had already been cleared by heavy earthmoving equipment.

Bombardier’s CEO, Alain Bellemare, was in the audience. LNA posted this report.

I’m in Dublin this week at the Airfinance Journal conference. Among my activities: interview one-on-one John Leahy, retired chief operating officer-customers, for Airbus, at the AFJ conference.

I’ll be reporting throughout the week from Dublin.

"From Canada to Deep South, Airbus displays jobs muscle - AL.com","Tue, 15 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTkvMDEvZnJvbS1jYW5hZGEtdG8tZGVlcC1zb3V0aC1haXJidXMtZGlzcGxheXMtam9icy1tdXNjbGUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With international attention turning to south Alabama on Wednesday for a major aerospace groundbreaking, the fact that a delegation of foreign and aviation-industry media stopped over in Mississippi on Tuesday was no accident.

Far from it: The group’s visit to a helicopter plant in Columbus, Miss., was part of a press tour organized by Airbus, a grand arc that started Monday with a tour of the plant in Mirabel, Canada, where Airbus and Bombardier already build their new A220 jetliners, and which will end Wednesday in Mobile, where Airbus is building a new assembly line to help meet the anticipated demand for the planes.

Update: Airbus, Alabama officials dig in

For Airbus the stop was a chance to illustrate the breadth of its North American activity. But for newcomers and local observers alike, it offered a reminder that when it comes to international investments, like the one it’s about to make in Mobile, Airbus plays a long game.

The story of the Airbus Helicopters plant goes back to the early 2000s. Local industrial development guru Joe Max Higgins Jr., whose winning ways have been the subject of a ""60 Minutes"" profile, told his audience Tuesday that at the time the so-called ""Golden Triangle"" of Starkville, Columbus and West Point had the infrastructure for big things.

""Back then,"" he said, ""our people didn't have a lot of confidence they could win.""

The company wasn't called Airbus, then. It was EADS -- a name which, like the lack of confidence -- may ring familiar in Mobile. EADS' Eurocopter division landed in the Golden Triangle with a contract to build hundreds of UH-72A Lakotas helicopters for the U.S. Army. ""I can't tell you how that decision changed this region,"" Higgins said Tuesday. ""It literally changed us.""

By 2011 the plant was churning out 60 of the light utility choppers a year and hitting an employment peak of around 380 people, said Mike Spears, Vice President of Industry for Airbus Helicopters in North America and head of the Columbus plant. Then as now, a significant portion of its workforce came from across the Alabama line just a few miles to the east.

2011 also was the year EADS finally lost a long and brutal battle over an Air Force tanker contract to Boeing. The defeat left deep wounds in Mobile, where EADS had planned to build its tankers.

Time passed. For Mobile, the years brought good news: The EADS consortium consolidated under the Airbus name and made good on its promise to build jets in Mobile, investing $600 million in a Final Assembly Line for its single-aisle A320 family of jetliners. The first A321 assembled in Alabama flew in March 2016, and since then the FAL has delivered more than 100 jets.

Airbus Helicopters in Columbus has seen some ups and downs. Production of the Lakota has tapered down, now running at about two per month. But the plant is no longer entirely dependent on military contracts, and it also produces about two single-engine H125s a month. Factor in its role in final delivery prep for a couple of other models, and it's putting out about 70 birds a year, and employing around 200 people, Spears said.

Building a new assembly line in Mobile is part of an effort to capitalize on red-hot demand for single-aisle jetliners. Both Airbus and archrival Boeing are doing everything they can to increase annual production, to fulfill thousands of orders.

The main assembly hall in Columbus showed certain similarity to the much larger A320 Final Assembly Line in Mobile, with aircraft moving from station to station as they gained various components. A worker leading a tour showed off a stripped-down Lakota airframe fresh out of the box from Germany. It actually started out in Japan, he said, where it was manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industry, then went to Germany for work, then arrived in Columbus for wiring, engine, electronics, interior, paint and everything else needed to make it operational.

That much, at least, was similar to Mobile. There, wings made in Wales are attached to fuselages shipped in from Germany, with myriad other components coming from elsewhere in Europe.

Economically, the Columbus plant is in a bit of a different world. Current army contracts mean it'll keep making Lakotas for a few more years at least. The civilian helicopter market has been soft for a few years now, Spears said, but is bound to heat up eventually. Airbus is staying competitive on both sides, offering newer models such as the single-engine H130 and the executive-oriented H160 on the commercial side, while pitching the H135 -- basically a smaller sibling of the Lakota -- for an upcoming Navy contract on the military side.

""Our goal is, you want a balance,"" he said. Meaning a balance between military and commercial.

There'll be no such balance in Mobile, where it's all commercial. But the Mississippi plant might still offer some lessons for folks in Mobile -- including a notion of how to handle the regional allure of local jobs.

As the Mobile City Council recently considered a multimillion-dollar incentive package for the new Airbus assembly line, several members made it clear they wanted to see local hiring.

""We put all our money in there, and people walk up in there, from what I've seen in the past, from other parts of the county, from other parts of the state, from other states, and take these jobs, and the money we put in here we're not going to get any residual benefits,"" said Councilman Fred Richardson. ""All we're trying to say now is we want benefits for what we put in. And if other communities want in, put the money up.""

It's likely that a portion of the Airbus workforce in Mobile commutes in from Mississippi. It might not feel Lower Alabama officials feel much better, but there is a regional quid pro quo. Spears said he figures that ""probably 20 percent of our employees live just across the line"" in Alabama. It's about 60 miles to Tuscaloosa and he said he knows one who commutes all the way from there.

He says it just comes with the territory. ""You just can't expect that everybody who works for you is going to come move in five miles away."" Even if they don't live in the neighborhood, he said, ""they're going to stop at Kroger, they're going to buy gas.""

There's a bigger picture too, he said. Regional political clout helps support big developments like the Airbus operations in Columbus and Mobile. It's not unusual for Alabama and Mississippi legislators to work together.

Those Lakotas they build in Columbus? You'll find a huge fleet of them at Fort Rucker, southeast of Montgomery, up around the corner of the Florida Panhandle from Mobile.

The Mississippi-Alabama border may be close by according to the map. But “it doesn’t really feel like there’s a line right there,” said Spears."
Airbus announces 400 new jobs; will build the A220 in Mobile - FreightWaves,"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub21pY3MvYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtYnVpbGQtYTIyMC1pbi1tb2JpbGXSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZWNvbm9taWNzL2FpcmJ1cy13aWxsLWJ1aWxkLWEyMjAtaW4tbW9iaWxlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(IMAGE: AIRBUS)

Airbus (AIR: EURONEXT) broke ground for its new A220 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama on Wednesday. The newest airliner in Airbus’ product line, the A220 is designed to revolutionize the market for 100-150 seat aircraft. Production is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year with deliveries to airlines commencing in 2020.

Reuters reported that Airbus will invest $300 million in the new facility, which will create 400 jobs. Its location in Mobile will be alongside Airbus’ current assembly line for the A320 commercial airliner. The plant already employs 700.

Airbus Mobile opened its final assembly plant at the Mobile Aeroplex, a combination of the city’s airport and manufacturing center, in 2015. Mobile’s status as a port city on the U.S. Gulf Coast is strategic for Airbus’ logistical operations. Maritime shipments including both large components (fuelselage, wings, and tail) and small parts are shipped from Hamburg to Mobile.

Airbus announced it has 500 orders already for the A220 and expects the new airplane to win a large portion of the 7,000 small-sized aircraft demand by major airlines over the next 20 years.

The aviation community is excited for the arrival of Airbus into the U.S. market. Delta Air Lines (DAL: NYSE) increased its orders for the A220 sixfold (from 15 to 90 aircraft), expecting to take first delivery in 2020. Other U.S. airlines that have ordered A220s include JetBlue (JBLU: NASDAQ), Moxy, and Republic Airways (RJET: NASDAQ).

The economic impact of the Airbus investment in Alabama has the potential to greatly benefit the region.

“Any time an aircraft manufacturer that size makes an investment in a community it creates a lot of jobs and opens the world to that community,” said Millie Hernandez-Becker, President of Skyqueen Enterprises, a New York-based aviation business development firm. “All of the ancillary businesses will be positively impacted by this. The FAA forecast states that aviation is a growth industry. It’s a positive thing for any community to have Airbus or Boeing.”

But not all industry participants are enthusiastic about the launch of the A220. Boeing (BA: NYSE) previously filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Commerce against Bombardier (BBD: TSX) in regard to selling the C-Series (the original classification of the A220) in the U.S., citing tactics used by Bombardier. Some experts consider what Bombardier did as “dumping,” and they also cited the numerous subsidies provided to Bombardier by the Government of Canada. The complaint led the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to levy a 300 percent tariff on the C-Series in 2017.

However, the ITC surprisingly changed course by voting to discard the tariff in January 2018, stating that Bombardier’s marketing of the C-Series did not diminish Boeing’s sales or revenue.

“The United States is one of the largest markets for us and this [Mobile] is our largest industrial base in the U.S. We have the skills and employees and it is the logical thing to do,” Airbus Americas CEO Jeff Knittel told Reuters."
Airbus on avoiding the perils of predicting the future of PaxEx - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDEvYWlyYnVzLW9uLWF2b2lkaW5nLXRoZS1wZXJpbHMtb2YtcHJlZGljdGluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The future is difficult to map, but it’s where many designers make their home.

At a working group held during the recent Red Cabin Innovation and Aircraft Seating conference in Hamburg, Airbus hosted a working group to discuss the trends driving design of aircraft cabins and encouraged participating designers to share their own views on what values will continue to drive cabin innovation in the foreseeable future.

Airbus industrial design manager Tobias Meyer, who led the working group, offered a very grounded perspective on the perils of prediction, telling attendees:

What will be the future? How will the future look in the next 10 or 20 years? We have no idea. The further out that we look into the future, we need to look at scenarios. There’s never one future, but there are different – sometimes close and sometimes far away – potential futures. This is what we see as ‘future scenarios’. It’s a little bit like risk-management.

When crafting its own future cabin concept several years ago, Airbus focused on principles more than specifics, identifying the core values that would drive passenger experience design for years to come.

“We created a potential future with key attributes that defined our concepts,” said Meyer. “The driving principle was of sustainability. We also looked at future passenger needs and what kind of technology would enable us to do something to address those passenger needs.”

Airbus categorized the future trends into two groups: needs and technologies. The needs were: recreation and health, multi-dimensional reality, seamless productivity, smart differentiation, and participative personalization.

“These were some of the needs that we saw in the future and I think these are becoming more relevant,” noted Meyer. “If you look at the new passenger experience, we always start with the basic needs of the passenger. We still look outside of the cabin, to see what trends drive our cabin experience. Of course, technology is always driving the experience and what we can really enable.”

The technology trends identified by Airbus were: bionic principles, advanced materials and sensors, sustainable architecture, automation and smart robotics, and intelligent data control.

These are ‘big picture’ trend categories, and innovation is happening in all corners, in various sectors. In general, they are safe bets.

To help fine-tune the industry’s future radar, Airbus created TrendSpace, a 360º market analysis of 23 cabin and market trends in four trend clusters: cabin classes and configurations, passenger experience and airline operations, airline business models and passenger landscape.

“It’s an awareness tool,” explained Meyer. “You get connected with some knowledge that we see in the market and you can define how much of that knowledge can affect the product that you are creating.”

Participants in the workshop – industry designers, manufacturers and suppliers – were asked to prioritize the trends which they believe will drive design in the near-term and long-term. The factors, in order of priority by popular vote, were: 1) revenue space maximization, 2) onboard connectivity and IFE, 3) aging passengers, 4) passenger stress and well-being, 5) digital travelers, 6) ancillary revenue, 7) airline branding and design, and 8) value of baggage.

Of course, designers and manufacturers in the aviation industry have a unique advantage: because the timeline for completion of airline programs is long, the work they focus on today – the experiential and technology factors they prioritize – will shape the reality of passenger experience a decade from now and beyond.

And, after all, as Abraham Lincoln said, “The best way to predict your future is to create it.”

When Delta puts its first new Airbus A220 into commercial service later this month, it will be just one of many more to follow as the next-generation single-aisle, 100-150 seat plane is quickly becoming the darling of the airlines. Airbus currently has orders for 527 of them on its books.

Just in the past few days, Delta signed on for another 15 A220s, bringing its total order to 90; JetBlue moved ahead with a firm order for 60 of the planes; and the start-up carrier currently known as Moxy, created by JetBlue founder David Neeleman, also signed a firm order for 60. North of the border, Air Canada has ordered 45 A220s, with the first ones due for delivery this year.

Just this week, Airbus announced that the jet has obtained ETOPS approval, meaning it could fly from the West Coast to Hawaii, or from the East Coast to Europe. Currently it has the authority for such long distance flights from Transport Canada, but approvals are pending with US and European regulators.

Delta will put its first A220-100s into service January 31 between New York LaGuardia-Boston and LaGuardia-Dallas/Ft. Worth. From March through June, the aircraft will gradually be deployed on Delta's DFW routes to Detroit, Salt Lake City, and Minneapolis-St. Paul; and on LaGuardia routes to Detroit and Houston.

Bay Area residents should get their first shot at flying in an A220 in mid-June, when Delta plans to start using the aircraft on two of its six daily flights between San Jose and Seattle.

While seats are slightly wider than average, seat pitch is about the same on Delta, with 30-32 inches in economy, 34 inches in Comfort+ and 36 inches in first class. You can take a look at Delta's A220 layout on SeatGuru. Delta's version of the A220 offers something unique: a window in the lavatory, which you can see in the slideshow at the top of this post.

Except for Moxy, the carriers will generally use the A220 to replace smaller regional jets on domestic routes. Delta will be using the A220-200, a 109-seat model with 12 first class seats, 15 in extra-legroom Comfort+, and 82 in regular economy. The economy seats are configured 2x3, and at almost 19 inches across, they're the widest in the airline's fleet (good news for ever-larger American flyers).

We got an advance look at one of the new Delta planes a few months ago. You can read about it here.

JetBlue is expected to start receiving its first new A220s in 2020 to replace its 100-passenger Embraer 190s. Besides its initial order for 60, the carrier has an option for 60 more starting in 2025. But unlike Delta, JetBlue has ordered the larger version of the new plane, designated the A220-300. It hasn't yet revealed seat configuration, but Airbus says the A220-300 is designed to carry 130 to 160 passengers. With new ETOPS approval, this could be the plane JetBlue uses to launch its much anticipated transatlantic flights.

One of the biggest attractions for airlines is the fuel efficiency of the A220 series. JetBlue said the A220-300s will burn 40 percent less fuel than the E190s they are replacing. And the plane's greater range will give the airline ""options to schedule it for transcontinental flying,"" JetBlue said.

David Neeleman's new airline -- tentatively known as Moxy – is also going with the larger A220-300. In addition to being the founder of JetBlue, Neeleman also started up Brazil's Azul Airlines and is a major investor in TAP Air Portugal. He is targeting a possible 2021 start for commercial service, but Neeleman hasn't yet said how many seats or cabin classes the aircraft will have, nor has he mentioned the initial routes the airline will serve. (He did hint, however, that with a maximum range of 3,678 miles, the A220-300 could operate between cities in the northeast U.S. and northwestern Europe.)

Neeleman's strategy for his new U.S. airline is to offer high-quality, low-cost service in secondary markets that have little or no competition, and he sees the new Airbus single-aisle plane as ideally suited for that goal. ""The A220's ability to operate profitably in thin, underserved markets across a broad spectrum of ranges is unique,"" Neeleman said. Besides the initial order for 60 planes, Moxy also has an option for 60 more.

Update: Airlines are now reporting that the deployment of the new A220 could be stalled by the government shutdown.

Travelers looking forward to trying Delta Air Lines’ highly anticipated Airbus A220 may have to wait longer than expected before snagging a seat on the new jet.

That’s because Delta’s planned launch of the A220 by the end of the month is now in jeopardy because of the federal government shutdown.

Speaking on the airline’s earnings conference call Tuesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said Delta’s Airbus A220 start date is “likely to be pushed back’’ due to the shutdown. The shutdown has delayed the Federal Aviation Administration certification Delta needs to begin flying paying passengers on new aircraft.

It’s not just Delta’s A220s that could be delayed.

Delta chief operating officer Gil West said on the same call that certification issues could also affect the airline’s A330-900neos if the shutdown continues.

Delta is expected to become the first North American carrier to take Airbus’ updated “neo” variant of the A330 widebody, with the first delivery expected to come this year.

“There’s not an immediate impact, but it certainly could have an impact downstream on us,” West said.

As for the A220, Bastian said Delta does not anticipate having to cancel any flights or routes if there’s a delay. Instead, Delta can keep flying other planes on the routes where it expected to add the A220.

The narrowbody planes, formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries, seem a candidate to become a passenger favorite. Delta's A220s have large overhead bins and feature two-by-three seating in economy, meaning fewer middle seats. All of the plane's seats will be wider than the industry average.

Delta has ordered two versions of the jet, with the smaller seating 109 passengers and the larger 130. Delta expects all 90 of the A220s it has ordered to be delivered by the end of 2023.

Introduction

January 17, 2019, © Leeham News: It’s all about the new Airbus A220 on the North America press tour Airbus is hosting this week. Airbus got this top modern aircraft as a windfall after Boeing tried to block its sale on the US Market in 2017.

While the tour presents the A220 in the best of lights, it can’t shine brighter than Airbus' own A320neo. The graph from the tour which positions them in capacity and range shows a clear little brother-large brother relationship. The reality, when comparing apples to apples, is another.

PARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates is exploring switching some orders for the world's largest jetliner, the Airbus A380, to the smaller A350 in a move raising new doubts about the future of Europe's superjumbo, people familiar with the matter said.

The Gulf carrier, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in more than 100 A380s, has been struggling to finalise a deal to buy another 36 to keep assembly lines open, due to differences with engine maker Rolls-Royce.

Now, Airbus is looking closely at closing A380 factories sooner than expected as part of a reshuffle of orders, with Chief Executive Tom Enders unlikely to leave the situation unresolved when his mandate ends in April, they said.

A person familiar with the matter said Airbus was looking ""extremely seriously"" at setting the timetable for a shutdown but said no decision had been taken.

Airbus said in a statement after Reuters first published news of the talks that it ""confirms it is in discussions with Emirates airline in relation to its A380 contract"". But it said details of negotiations were confidential.

Emirates and Rolls-Royce declined to comment.

Emirates announced the deal for up to 36 aircraft worth as much as $16 billion at list prices a year ago, throwing a lifeline to the programme's roughly 3,000 workers and securing its future for at least another decade.

The airline is an ardent supporter of the jet, which was designed with luxury features like bars and showers.

But sales of four-engined planes are tumbling as many airlines switch to smaller twin-engined jets like the A350 and Boeing 777 due to improvements in range and efficiency.

A year-long impasse between Emirates and Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings has so far blocked the order.

Airbus is trying to broker a complex workaround which could see Emirates take smaller jets also powered by Rolls-Royce while it tries to secure homes for as many A380s as possible, with British Airways recently expressing interest.

Story continues

Airbus has dangled the prospect of closing A380 production before, and industry sources say such manoeuvres can be a negotiating tactic to force the feuding parties to agree.

But time is running out for the A380 with few airlines willing to spend the sums invested by Emirates, which has made it a backbone of its global network alongside the Boeing 777.

The production line is ""untenable"", a senior industry source said

A decision by Emirates to order the A350 would offer a respite for Airbus and its main engine partner Rolls-Royce after the Gulf carrier axed an order for the A350 in 2014.

Airbus and Rolls are keen to maintain a foothold with the Gulf carrier and prevent Boeing filling the gap with more of its General Electric-powered 777s.

SMBC Aviation Capital orders 65 A320neo Family aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMS1zbWJjLWF2aWF0aW9uLWNhcGl0YWwtb3JkZXJzLTY1LWEzMjBuZW8tZmFtaWx5LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leading aircraft lessor SMBC Aviation Capital has boosted its total order book for the A320neo Family to 181 aircraft after signing a firm order for an additional 65 A320neo Family aircraft (15 A321neo and 50 A320neo). The order was finalised in 2018 and included in the year-end order figures.

In addition, the agreement includes an upsizing of 15 A320neo from a pre-existing order to 15 of the largest member of the single-aisle Family – the A321neo – taking SMBC Aviation Capital’s total for the type to 30. With its unbeatable seat mile cost, longer range and wider cabin, the A321neo offers airlines the flexibility to expand their networks using wide-body cabin products on new longer-haul routes which were not previously possible with a single-aisle jetliner.

“Demand for the latest technology aircraft has been strong both from our existing and new customers, hence our decision today to proceed with this order. In the current environment, airlines are seeking more fuel efficient aircraft. The make-up of our order book positions us very well for the future to deliver on those needs. We have a strong relationship with Airbus and we look forward to working with them to continue to deliver for our customers long into the future,” said Peter Barrett, CEO, SMBC Aviation Capital.

The order for 65 is in addition to an earlier agreement for six A320neo made in March, bringing the total number of A320neo Family ordered in 2018 to 71.

“As one of the world’s leading aircraft lessors, SMBC Aviation Capital’s repeat order demonstrates its financial astuteness in making wise investments in the A320neo Family. In 2018, the direct leasing market represented over 30% of our 800 worldwide deliveries – as much as Europe and the Americas combined,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines, Sharklets and cabin efficiency enablers, which together deliver 20% fuel savings by 2020. With more than 6,500 orders received from over 100 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.

“As we approach our 20th anniversary, the impressive range and economics of the highly efficient A220, combined with the outstanding performance of our existing fleet of Airbus A321 and restyled A320 aircraft, will help ensure we deliver the best onboard experience to customers and meet our long-term financial targets as we continue disciplined growth into the future,” said Robin Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, JetBlue.

JetBlue’s existing Airbus fleet includes 193 A320 and A321ceo aircraft in operation, with an additional 85 A321neo aircraft on order.

“JetBlue has proven there is no contradiction between economic efficiency and a high quality product,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “Their endorsement of the A220 proves this aircraft meets those two criteria better than any alternative in its segment. Thank you JetBlue and congratulations on this big milestone in your growth.”

The order was completed the last week of December. Airbus will produce the A220-300 aircraft at a new U.S. assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama. Construction of the plant, to be located adjacent to the existing Airbus A320 assembly facility, will begin later this month.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and true widebody comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. With a range of up to 3,200 nm (5020 km), the A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft.

The start-up U.S. airline code-named “Moxy” has signed a firm order with Airbus to purchase 60 A220-300 aircraft also.



With an order book of more than 500 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years, according to Airbus.

On safari with the H125 and H130 - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAxLW9uLXNhZmFyaS13aXRoLXRoZS1oMTI1LWFuZC1oMTMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud. Adapted from Rotor magazine #114.

Tropic Air Kenya flies nearly 4,000 tourists a year throughout sub-Saharan Africa in six Airbus helicopters. Below, a closer look at Kenya’s foremost air charter and helicopter company.

One of the first impressions that visitors traveling with Tropic Air Kenya get is of the operator’s remote premises. The company is located on the outskirts of Nanyuki, a small town that in the early days was established to serve settlers, and today serves a multitude of businesses, including flower growers and the British Army Training Units (BATUK).

Tropic Air’s cluster of wooden buildings stand in the centre of a vast lawn, an airstrip running through it, while jagged and snow-topped Mount Kenya offers a magnificent backdrop, and the savannah plains of Laikipia and Samburu lie beyond. Founded in 1990 with just one leased Cessna 206 fixed-wing aircraft, the air charter company today has a fleet of five Cessna aircraft and six helicopters – the most recent purchased in April 2018, when the company added an H130 to their stable of H125s. Just short of 30 years since its inception, Tropic Air has grown into a market leader in Kenyan tourism, offering a diversity of exciting soft adventure expeditions.

MRO activities at Tropic Air facilities, Nanyuki Airfield.

Spontaneous surprises

At the service of its clients, from a morning flight on Mount Kenya to a two-week helicopter safari, Tropic Air covers all of the region’s tourist destinations. Besides Kenya, popular heli-expeditions include gorilla treks in Uganda and the Congo; Ethiopia adventures focused on history and culture; and discovery flights over Chad and Northern Sudan’s remote desert landscapes. Once or twice a year, they arrange trips further afield, covering parts of southern African.

The company’s footprint is always evolving to explore new places and take advantage of unique experiences. “We went up into Chad, in the Sahara desert,” says Jamie Roberts, Tropic Air Kenya founder and Managing Director. “It’s a three day ferry flight one way in the H125. We spent about six weeks up there, making the most of the Sahara’s incredible diversity of landscapes and adventures.”

The company’s appeal lies in its element of surprise: spontaneous touch-downs when something special is spotted, a reservoir of anecdotes from its pilots and guides, the knowledge of when best to appreciate the region’s qualities and unique attributes.

Up to four passengers can go aloft on wildlife safaris.

When we’re flying tourists there’s nothing to beat the H130. It has incredible visibility, it’s very comfortable, there’s a lot of space and clients love it.

- Jamie Roberts, owner of Tropic Air Kenya

Suited to the challenge

Averaging around 2,000 flight hours per year between the fleet, some 70% of which are for tourism, Tropic Air’s helicopters are particularly suited to their task. The H130’s roomy cabin and large cockpit windows are an asset for wildlife viewing, when anywhere from one to four passengers might go aloft hoping to glimpse mountain gorillas lumbering through the ferns, a Walia ibex poised on a cliff or an Ethiopian wolf standing sentinel.

The continent’s sheer range of altitudes presents a unique challenge to any air operator: Ethiopia’s Danakil Depression lies below sea level while Mount Kenya at 5,199 metres is the region’s second-highest peak after Mt. Kilimanjaro. No wonder, then, that Tropic Air’s main fleet is the single-engine H125, renowned for its high and hot performance.

“To me the H125 is the best of the helicopters, but when we’re flying tourists there’s nothing to beat the H130,” says Jamie Roberts. “It has incredible visibility, it’s very comfortable, there’s a lot of space and clients love it.”"

Delta Air Lines has ordered 15 additional A220 aircraft, bringing to 90 the total number of the new generation, highly fuel-efficient jetliners the world’s second-largest airline has on order. The additional orders are the airline’s first for the -300 model. Delta also converted earlier A220 orders to the larger -300, bringing to 50 the number of A220-300s on order.

“These additional A220 aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade,” said Gil West, Delta’s Chief Operating Officer. “We look forward to taking our first A220-300 in 2020 at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.”

Delta placed its initial order for 75 aircraft in 2016. Airbus will produce the A220-300s at a new U.S. assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama. Construction of the plant, to be located adjacent to the existing Airbus A320 assembly facility, will begin later in January.

“Delta has always been deeply focused on the passenger experience, and the A220 fits perfectly with that philosophy,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “You just need to take a look at Delta’s cabin on the A220 to see it’s setting a new standard in short-haul flying. The A220 will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.”

Lessons Learned from Kaggle’s Airbus Challenge. | by Yassine Alouini - Towards Data Science,"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9sZXNzb25zLWxlYXJuZWQtZnJvbS1rYWdnbGVzLWFpcmJ1cy1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtMjUyZTI1YzVlZmFj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The challenge banner

Over the last three months, I have participated in the Airbus Ship Detection Kaggle challenge. As evident from the title, it is a detection computer vision (segmentation to be more precise) competition proposed by Airbus (its satellite data division) that consists in detecting ships in satellite images.

Before I start this challenge, I was (and somehow still) a beginner in the domain of segmentation. I have good grasp of “classical” machine learning (gradient boosting trees, linear models, and the likes) and have used it in production but deep learning was still a new thing for me.

Previously, I have written a series of blog posts explaining and implementing CNNs using Keras (check it here) and taken the great Coursera deep learning track series. However, I felt that what I have learned lacked practical applications. In fact, despite some guided projects, the course alone won’t help you develop “real-world” skills.

The competition’s timeline

So, what to do about that?

I started looking for “real-world” applications and so, around March 2018, I came across the Data Science Bowl 2018 Kaggle challenge. The competition consists in detecting cells’ nuclei. Similarly to the Airbus challenge, it was an instance segmentation task.

When I found out about this challenge, it was nearing its end (the competition was over by the 16th of April 2018). So, I followed some of the discussions, read and explored some of the models, learned a lot about segmentation using the U-Net model (and its variations), but didn’t have time to participate.

Thus, when the Airbus challenge came, I was more excited and set the following goal for myself: train a segmentation model and make at least one submission from it.

Have I achieved my goal?

Yes, I did and probably a lot more (you can decide by yourself once you read this post).

Overall, the process was enjoyable (most of the time at least) and I have gained a lot of practical knowledge. In what follows, I will share with you some of the lessons that I have learned (in no particular order).

Let’s get started."

European aerospace and defence group Airbus has launched an inquiry into the origin and targets of a cyberattack detected earlier in January, the same month that French IT consulting group Altran also saw attempts to breach its systems.

An Airbus spokesman said Thursday that the attack was detected on January 6 and that personal data on some European personnel was targeted starting January 10, prompting it to inform France's data regulator CNIL the following day.

Under the EU's strict new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted last year, companies must inform regulators within 72 hours if such attacks put personal data at risk.

The Airbus inquiry is still underway to determine who was behind the attack, which focussed on the IT systems of its commercial aircraft division, the spokesman said.

The group said no commercial operations were impacted by the breach, and that attackers appeared to be seeking contact and IT identification details of some of its 130,000 employees.

The inquiry also aims to determine if specific data was being targeted at a key player in Europe's defence and security industries.

Airbus is a major supplier of military jets and weapons as well as communication and navigation satellites to European nations, generating revenue of 59 billion euros ($68 billion) in 2017.

It also provides cybersecurity services for essential government networks and infrastructure.

Security experts said Altran was targeted by a ransomware attack

Infection risks

Altran Technologies, one of the largest IT consulting firms in Europe, announced Monday that it had detected on January 24th an attack that impacted its operations on the continent.

But unlike the Airbus attack, the hackers did not appear to be seeking personal data but rather access to files in ""many European countries, including France.""

Although Altran said it had not detected any cases of stolen data, it had to shut down its IT networks ""to protect our clients, employees and partners.""

Security experts said Altran was targeted by a ransomware attack, which usually attempts to lock a person or company out of key data, or threaten to publish the private data, unless a payment is made.

And because modern companies share network services across several sites, ""the files on central servers can be infected quite quickly,"" said Ivan Fontarensky, head of cyberdefence at the French defence and electronics group Thales.

Altran has brought in outside experts to help determine the origin and extent of the attack, and said that so far it ""has not identified any stolen data, nor instances of a propagation of the incident to our clients.""

The company's clients operate in a wide range of sectors including defence, energy and infrastructure industries—and like Airbus, it also offers cybersecurity services.

The EU moved to require companies to inform regulators of personal data breaches after accusing several high-profile companies of failing to inform users that passwords or personal data had been compromised by hackers.

The positions are the first wave of production jobs announced for the company’s A220 aircraft assembly line. The open positions include Aircraft Structure/Installation Mechanics, Installers for Aircraft Cabin Furnishings and Aircraft Electricians.

The A-220 Aircraft will be assembled like the current A-320 Model, where its parts will be shipped to Mobile.

Officials says they are looking to hire nearly 600 people over the next 18 months for both lines.

""The first couple of waves will have the opportunity to do some training in Mirabel, Canada for about 3-6 months and then they will come back here as the production of the line starts and get to work,” said Stephanie Burt, Airbus Spokesperson.

Airbus is working in conjunction with its hiring partner AIDT. Successful candidates for all positions will participate in several weeks of training at AIDT in a combination of classroom and on-the-job training. Production on the first aircraft begins in Q3 2019.

Airbus confirms A220 orders with 'Moxy' and JetBlue - Airline Ratings,"Sun, 06 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1jb25maXJtcy1hMjIwLW9yZGVycy1tb3h5LWpldGJsdWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has firmed up orders for 120 A220 aircraft, including 60 for the new airline venture involving JetBlue founder David Neeleman.

The new Neeleman venture, currently code-named Moxy but unlikely to retain the moniker, was unveiled at the Farnborough International Airshow in July.

The aviation entrepreneur – who was also involved in the start of Canada’s WestJet, founded Brazil’s Azul Airlines and has been a major force in TAP Air Portugal’s revitalization – has also ordered the bigger A220-300s and expects to receive his first aircraft in 2021.

He told Conde Nast Traveler recently he was starting the new airline because he saw an opportunity “to build a better mousetrap” due to consolidation of the industry in the US.

He said US airlines had again become hub focused and there were many cities not accessible via non-stop services where there was an opportunity “to get people there twice as fast at half the price”.

He also plans to build technology aimed at offering superior customer service and flexibility.

READ Delta starts selling A220 routes with the widest seats.

He sees the A220, formally the Bombardier C Series, as offering maximum flexibility in terms of offering the opportunity to introduce a premium cabin as well as the ability to reach destinations such as Hawaii, Brazil and Portugal from the US Midwest.

“The A220-300 is the right airplane for a new airline that will be focused on passenger service and satisfaction,” Neeleman said in A220 order announcement.

“With a low cost of operation and spacious cabin, the A220 will allow us to provide passengers with lower fares and a high quality, comfortable flying experience.

“The A220’s ability to operate profitably in thin, underserved markets across a broad spectrum of ranges is unique”.

Airbus will produce the planes at a new US assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, construction of which will begin in January 2019.

JetBlue also confirmed an order announced in July for 60 A220s to add to its fleet of A320s and A321s.

JetBlue’s planes will also be produced in the Alabama facility and are in addition to 85 A21neos the airline currently has on order. The US carrier now has 193 A320 and A321 aircraft.

“As we approach our 20th anniversary, the impressive range and economics of the highly efficient A220, combined with the outstanding performance of our existing fleet of Airbus A321 and restyled A320 aircraft, will help ensure we deliver the best onboard experience to customers and meet our long-term financial targets as we continue disciplined growth into the future,” JetBlue chief executive Robin Hayes said in the announcement.

The fuel-efficient 100- to 150-seater now has orders for more than 500 aircraft."

Mobile County approves $4 million Airbus incentive plan - AL.com,"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTkvMDEvbW9iaWxlLWNvdW50eS1hcHByb3Zlcy00LW1pbGxpb24tYWlyYnVzLWluY2VudGl2ZS1wbGFuLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Mobile County Commission has voted to approve $4 million in economic development incentives for the new jetliner assembly line Airbus is building in Mobile.

The $4 million will be paid out at a rate of up to $400,000 a year over 10 years, to reimburse Airbus ""for capital expenses incurred in developing, constructing, and equipping the A220 Project."" Airbus currently produces A320-family aircraft at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley; its second Final Assembly Line will produce the newer, smaller A220 family, with the first delivery expected in 2020.

The city of Mobile is considering an identical $4 million commitment, with a council vote expected Tuesday.

The project agreement also calls for the city and county to grant or support various fee waivers and tax abatements; the projected value of those parts of the economic development package has not yet been announced. Mobile County Commissioner Jerry Carl said Tuesday that the commission has not yet approved that part of the package, and that he expects to see it come up for a separate vote in the near future.

The Alabama Department of Commerce also has been working to finalize an incentive package, whose terms have not yet been revealed. Airbus will hold a ceremonial groundbreaking for the new assembly line on Wednesday.

The measure generated some discussion at a preliminary meeting on Thursday, all favorable, and county commissioners approved it without debate on Monday.

At the Thursday session, Mobile County Commission President Connie Hudson said that this project, added to Airbus's existing facilities in Mobile, made for a true blockbuster development. ""That is roughly about an $800 million capital investment in the Brookley Aeroplex and about 1,000 jobs,"" she said.

At the same meeting, Commissioner Jerry Carl said that when the new assembly line is up and running, Mobile's jetliner production will rank it fourth in the world. Hudson repeated that claim after Monday's vote.

The new project is estimated as being a $210 million capital investment. The project agreement with the city and county requires Airbus to meet a target of 432 new employees to earn the full $8 million in reimbursements. It has already begun taking applications for the first of those jobs.

""Airbus is dedicated to providing new jobs in our community,"" Commissioner Merceria Ludgood said in a statement released after Monday's vote. ""We are proud to support Airbus and also to support its commitment to AIDT and Flight Works Alabama in training our work force.""

“The company’s vision and its teamwork with our local leaders has been a great success,” Hudson said in the same statement. “We welcome their expansion and continued contributions to the county.”"
Boeing flies past Airbus with 2018 aircraft deliveries - Phys.org,"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTAxLWJvZWluZy1mbGllcy1haXJidXMtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDEtYm9laW5nLWZsaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1haXJjcmFmdC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing reported a second straight year of record commercial plane deliveries in 2018, but missed its forecasts

Boeing reported record commercial plane deliveries for the second straight year on Tuesday and although short of the company's forecast the figures still beat those of Boeing's European rival Airbus.

The US aerospace giant, which has capitalized on rising global demand for air travel, reported deliveries of 806 planes for the year, up from 763 in 2017. The biggest share came from the single-aisle 737, with 580 planes.

In October, Boeing had forecast annual plane deliveries of between 810 and 815.

European airbus giant Airbus meanwhile said Tuesday it had delivered 800 commercial aircraft last year, in line with its target and also a record for the company. This compares with the 718 deliveries Airbus reported for 2017.

The Airbus 2018 delivery number was still subject to final auditing, the company said.

Aircraft deliveries are a more telling indicator of sales than orders, as planes are typically paid for on delivery.

""Boeing raised the bar again in 2018 thanks to our teammates' incredible focus on meeting customer commitments and continuously improving quality and productivity,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Kevin McAllister.

""In a dynamic year, our production discipline and our supplier partners helped us build and deliver more airplanes than ever before to satisfy the strong demand for air travel across the globe.""

Airbus also landed record deliveries, but fewer than its arch rival Boeing

Boeing reported 893 net orders for 2018 valued at $143.6 billion by list prices. With the latest orders, the company said it had a seven-year order backlog.

The company highlighted Hawaiian Airlines had switched from Airbus to Boeing and identified Turkish Airlines as a new customer. It also boosted business with American Airlines and United Airlines.

""Another year of healthy jet orders continues to support our long-term forecast for robust global demand that will see the commercial airplane fleet double in 20 years,"" said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing.

Shares of Boeing were up 3.4 percent at $339.25 in midday trading on Wall Street.

In Paris, Airbus shares closed up 3.7 percent at 86.65 euros.

The aircraft is ROKAF’s first Airbus A330 MRTT, which was selected in June 2015 as its future air-to-air refuelling and transport aircraft after an ‘open and objective competition’.

Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus and Israel Aerospace Industries’ B767-300 Multi-Mission Tanker Transport (MMTT) also participated in the competition.

South Korea agreed to purchase four Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft under a $1.3bn deal. The remaining three units are expected to be delivered by the end of this year.

The aircraft completed ground and flight tests at Gimhae Air Base in Busan, South Korea, in November 2018 before handing it over to the air force.

“The A330 MRTT has clearly established itself as the world’s premier tanker and strategic transport aircraft, and has been widely praised by the current operators.”

According to Airbus, the new-generation the A330 MRTT will extend the endurance and range of the ROKAF’s fighter aircraft fleet. Based on the A330-200 airliner, the MRTT can carry up to 111t of fuel and offload 50,000kg of fuel in a four-hour loitering mission at more than 1,000nm.

Airbus executive vice-president Fernando Alonso said: “The A330 MRTT has clearly established itself as the world’s premier tanker and strategic transport aircraft, and has been widely praised by the current operators. It will be a critical asset of the ROKAF and leading air forces worldwide for many decades.”

The 59m-long A330 MRTT delivered to ROKAF is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines and will offer strategic transport capabilities for passengers and freight.

Equipped with the Airbus refuelling boom system, the aircraft can be configured in a variety of layouts for passenger and freight transportation or medical evacuation purposes.

South Korea has now become the seventh country to operate the A330 MRTT. Airbus has so far received orders for the aircraft from 12 nations.

This latest delivery increases the total number of in-service aircraft worldwide to 35.

Last month, Airbus received an order from the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to deliver an additional three A330 MRTT aircraft."

Facebook is reportedly testing solar-powered internet drones again — this time with Airbus - TechCrunch,"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxOS8wMS8yMS9mYWNlYm9vay1haXJidXMtc29sYXItZHJvbmVzLWludGVybmV0LXByb2dyYW0v0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDE5LzAxLzIxL2ZhY2Vib29rLWFpcmJ1cy1zb2xhci1kcm9uZXMtaW50ZXJuZXQtcHJvZ3JhbS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Facebook last year grounded its ambitious plan to develop a solar-powered drone to beam internet across the world, but the company isn’t done with the concept, it seems. The social media giant is working with aeronautics giant Airbus to test drones in Australia, according to a new report from Germany’s NetzPolitik.

Using a request under Australia’s Freedom of Information Act, NetzPolitik got hold of a document that shows the two companies spent last year in talks over a collaboration with test flights scheduled for November and December 2018. The duo have collaborated before on communication systems for satellite drones.

Those trials — and it isn’t clear if they took place — involved the use of Airbus’ Zephyr drone, a model that is designed for “defence, humanitarian and environmental missions.” The Zephyr is much like Facebook’s now-deceased Aquila drone blueprint; it is a HAPS — “High Altitude Pseudo Satellite” — that uses solar power and can fly for “months.”

The Model S version chosen by Facebook sports a 25-meter wingspan, can operate at up to 20km altitude and it uses millimeter-wave radio to broadcast to the ground.

The Facebook and Airbus were designed to test a payload from the social network — doubtless internet broadcasting gear — but, since the document covers planning and meetings prior to the tests, we don’t know what the outcome or results were.

“We continue to work with partners on High Altitude Platform System (HAPS) connectivity. We don’t have further details to share at this time,” a Facebook spokesperson told NetzPolitik.

TechCrunch contacted Facebook for further comment (06:55 am EST), but the company had not responded at the time of writing.

Facebook has a raft of projects that are aimed at increasing internet access worldwide, particularly in developing regions such as Asia, Africa and Latin America. The drone projects may be its boldest, they are aimed at bringing connectivity to remote areas, but it has also used software and existing infrastructure to try to make internet access more affordable.

That has included the controversial Internet.org project, which was outlawed in India because it violated net neutrality by selecting the websites and apps that could be used. Since renamed to Free Basics — likely promoted by the Indian setback — it has been scaled back in some markets but, still, Facebook said last year that the program has reached nearly 100 million people to date. Beyond that top line number, little is known about the service, which also includes paid tiers for users.

That aside, the company also has a public-private WiFi program aimed at increasing hotspots for internet users while they are out and about."

Airbus will produce the planes at a new plant here, with construction beginning this month. The Moxy venture was unveiled at the Farnborough International Airshow in July.

Neeleman sees the A220, formally the Bombardier C Series, as offering maximum flexibility in terms of offering the opportunity to introduce a premium cabin as well as the ability to reach destinations such as Hawaii, Brazil and Portugal from the US Midwest. He has also ordered the bigger A220-300s and expects to receive his first aircraft in 2021.

“The A220-300 is the right airplane for a new airline that will be focused on passenger service and satisfaction,” Neeleman said in the A220 order announcement. With a low cost of operation and spacious cabin, the A220 will allow us to provide passengers with lower fares and a high quality, comfortable flying experience. The A220’s ability to operate profitably in thin, underserved markets across a broad spectrum of ranges is unique”.

JetBlue will add the A220s to its fleet of A320s and A321s. The A220s will also be produced in the Mobile facility, in addition to 85 A21neos the airline currently has on order. JetBlue now has 193 A320 and A321 aircraft."

Tom Enders, the CEO of French aviation giant Airbus has warned that the company could be forced to pull investments from the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit outcome, likely impacting tens of thousands of jobs and cost the British economy billions.

""The UK's aerospace sector now stands at the precipice,"" Enders said in a video message shared by the company Thursday morning. ""If there is a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK.""

""Please don't listen to the Brexiteers' madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong,"" he continued. ""Make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.""

France's Airbus, which alongside Boeing delivers the majority of aircraft used in commercial aviation, has been a vociferous critic of Brexit since the vote in 2016, issuing a similar warning back in June last year that it could drastically lower its footprint in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Airbus alone has 14,000 UK employees in Bristol, Portsmouth, Wales, and elsewhere, and supports another 110,000 UK jobs, Enders said in the video published to the company's YouTube channel — and adds $7.8 billion to the UK GDP.

During the video message, Enders appeared to back the withdrawal agreement put forward by Prime Minister Theresa May, but roundly rejected by the UK parliament.

""It is a disgrace that more than two years after the result of the 2016 referendum, businesses are still unable to plan properly for the future,"" he said. ""If you are really sure that Brexit is best for Britain, come together and deliver a pragmatic withdrawal agreement.""

Airbus' intervention comes at a time of enormous uncertainty over the future of Brexit. After May's withdrawal agreement was rejected by parliament last week, the direction Britain is headed is completely unclear.

Some believe that Britain is moving towards either delaying Brexit by extending Article 50, or by holding another referendum, while others see the UK heading for the so-called ""default"" option of a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister May, meanwhile, continues to push for her deal, saying it is the only Brexit that delivers on the referendum result.

Airbus chases aircraft lessors as order race tightens - Business Insider,"Fri, 04 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtY2hhc2VzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWxlc3NvcnMtYXMtb3JkZXItcmFjZS10aWdodGVucy0yMDE5LTHSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ItYWlyYnVzLWNoYXNlcy1haXJjcmFmdC1sZXNzb3JzLWFzLW9yZGVyLXJhY2UtdGlnaHRlbnMtMjAxOS0xP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE PHOTO: An Airbus A330neo is pictured on its final assembly line at Airbus headquarters in Colomiers, near Toulouse Thomson Reuters

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has been chasing deals with leasing companies in recent weeks to try to narrow a gap in orders against rival Boeing , while experts debate whether the planemaker met its delivery target after shares took a beating.

The outcome of the recent leasing talks could affect a tighter-than-expected race for orders in 2018, though Airbus is relying on a recent burst of orders for a newly acquired Canadian jet program and lags Boeing on a like-for-like basis.

The last-minute order flurry complicates a jigsaw of data awaited by investors as uncertainty lingers over whether Airbus met its crucial aircraft delivery target for 2018 -- a reliable guide to profits and a barometer of supply chain tensions.

Industry sources have said Airbus was unlikely to meet the 800-jet goal (782 excluding the Canadian A220), but others said Airbus could still spring a surprise after workers delivered jets late on Dec 31 that had not been expected to make the cut.

Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Airbus had delivered more than 790 and fewer than 800 aircraft in 2018.

Shares in Airbus rebounded 3 percent on Friday after falling as much as 7.9 percent on Thursday due to doubts over deliveries and what dealers described as a possible trading error.

Airbus is due to announce final figures on Jan 11, but without the fanfare of an annual news conference that for years featured outspoken former sales chief John Leahy as the company reins in communication before its full results, due on Feb 14.

On the race for new orders, Irish leasing company SMBC Aviation was in talks with Airbus in the closing stretch of 2018 and looked close to signing an order to expand its narrow-body fleet by several dozen jets, industry sources said.

SMBC Aviation and Airbus declined comment.

Airbus was also said to be scouting for business in China, where it has a deal pending with lessor ICBC for 80 jets.

A provisional order was announced at the Farnborough Airshow last July but the name of the buyer was never officially disclosed and the order is not yet on Airbus's books.

People familiar with the deal linked it at the time to ICBC Leasing, one of China's fastest-growing leasing companies.

A similar deal for 100 planes from Chinese-owned lessor Avolon, which had been kept under wraps in similar conditions as the industry waited to see how trade tensions between China and the United States would play out, was confirmed in December.

Both Airbus and Boeing typically turn to leasing companies to stay afloat when economic concerns deter airlines, but the financiers who now control about half the world fleet pick their moment carefully in order to capture the steepest discounts.

Airbus receives various changes to orders - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMS8xMS9haXJidXMtcmVjZWl2ZXMtdmFyaW91cy1jaGFuZ2VzLXRvLW9yZGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus receives various changes to orders

Airbus’ 2018 results have disclosed various changes to their backlog, with airlines adjusting, cancelling or announcing orders. The following are the airlines identified under these changes:

Unidentified/Hong Kong Airlines A380 cancellation

A large discovery, however and expected one, was the removal of 10 A380s from the backlog which came from an undisclosed customer in 2014. Although ordered by Hong Kong Airlines in 2011, the customer was removed from the order in 2014. The removal of this order now leaves Airbus with 87 aircraft in the backlog, of which, 53 are destined for Emirates. 12 aircraft were delivered to airlines in 2017, however 2018 will see production dip to just eight aircraft.

LATAM A350-1000 conversion

Sticking on the line of widebody aircraft, LATAM Airlines Group has converted an additional four A350-1000s to the smaller A350-900, leaving the airline with only eight on order. This conversion alone is a continuation of their existing conversions to the A350-900 after initially converting the smaller variant to the A350-1000 until 14 were on order.

Air Cote d’lvoire A320neo conversion

Air Cote d’lvoire, which commenced operations in 2012, holds a fleet of all-Airbus jets as well as four Bombardier Q400s. 2016 saw the airline order two A320neo aircraft, however it’s been unveiled in Airbus’ backlog that the airline has converted these aircraft to the smaller A319neo, giving the aircraft a minuscule boost. 55 A319neos are now on order by airlines, with the CFM LEAP powered variant recently securing certification.

Etihad A320neo cancellation

As part of restructuring plans, Etihad has cancelled part of their order for Airbus aircraft. Of the A350s, A321neos and A320neos on order, Etihad elected to cancel all 10 A320neos on order.

Ordered in 2013 as part of a large Airbus order, Etihad is now left with 26 A321neos, 22 A350-1000s and 40 A350-900s on order. Speculation as to whether the airline would keep their A350s has floated around the aviation community, however their first aircraft, MSN 290, is already in final production. Until an announcement is made by the airline or Airbus, the order is still in place.

Additionally, the airline is also in talks with Boeing for their side of the order, which consists of the 777X and 787.

Middle East Airlines A330neo order

Originally noted towards the end of 2018, it’s now been confirmed that Middle East Airlines has placed an order for four A330-900s. Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the order also includes a deal with Rolls-Royce for a long-term maintenance agreement.

Deliveries will commence in 2021 and will replace existing A330ceo (current engine option) aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.

Overall, Airbus has orders for 230 A330-900s – a decrease by four frames. The smaller A330-800 is still struggling with only eight on order. Despite this, Airbus remains confident the A330neo will be a successful aircraft and states the replacement cycle for existing A330s hasn’t kicked in.

December Rush

December is the busiest year for manufacturers as they all scramble to meet their yearly delivery targets. After suffering from production delays and a lack of orders compared to Boeing, Airbus went into overdrive and secured nearly 400 orders for the backlog in December alone, bringing things closer to the competition.

The following list breaks the orders down:

Total = 392 aircraft

Boeing Soars Past Airbus With 893 Net Orders in 2018 - The Motley Fool,"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzAxLzEzL2JvZWluZy1zb2Fycy1wYXN0LWFpcmJ1cy13aXRoLTg5My1uZXQtb3JkZXJzLTIwMTguYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft order activity remained healthy last year -- particularly for Boeing.

After trailing Boeing (BA -1.94%) all year in terms of order activity, Airbus (EADSY -1.16%) had a strong December, bringing in nearly as many orders as it did in the first 11 months of 2018 combined.

However, Boeing also posted solid sales numbers last month, allowing it to take the sales crown for 2018 in decisive fashion. That victory broke a five-year winning streak for Airbus.

Airbus had another great December

As of the end of November, Airbus had captured 380 net orders in 2018, leaving it well behind Boeing, which had secured 690 net firm orders by that point. By the time December was done, Airbus had nearly doubled its 2018 order total, pulling in an additional 367 net firm orders. That performance, however, still didn't come close to matching Airbus' December 2017 showing. In that month, the company booked 776 net firm orders to leapfrog Boeing and end that year with 1,109 net orders.

Airbus thus ended 2018 with 747 net firm orders for the year, just shy of its annual production of 800 jets. That marks the first time in nearly a decade the company's orders fell short of its deliveries.

Last month, Airbus completed orders with three U.S. airlines for a total of 135 A220-300s. The European aircraft manufacturer also reported several big orders for its best-selling A320neo family of aircraft. In addition to finalizing a 100-plane deal with aircraft leasing company Avolon, Airbus also booked an order for 80 A320neos from an undisclosed customer and an order for 50 A320neos and 17 A321neos from a different undisclosed customer.

Airbus also reported a handful of smaller aircraft sales for December, offset by 25 order cancellations.

But it's Boeing for the win

Boeing didn't score as many orders as Airbus in December, but it entered the month with a massive lead in the 2018 order race. The American aerospace giant booked 203 net orders last month, bringing its full-year total to 893, enough to beat Airbus by nearly 20%. It also marked the eighth time in nine years that orders exceeded deliveries for Boeing. The exception was 2016, when Boeing experienced a modest order slump.

Boeing's December order activity was driven primarily by a single order for 125 737 MAXs from an unidentified customer. The company also booked a variety of smaller orders during the month, including, somewhat surprisingly, 18 additional orders for current-generation 777s, which had been selling slowly for the past few years.

Widebody orders remain the problem -- especially for Airbus

While Boeing posted a strong order total for 2018, the 737 MAX accounted for the vast majority of its orders. Boeing's four widebody aircraft families -- the 747, 767, 777, and 787 -- combined for only 218 orders last year, slightly fewer than the 226 widebodies Boeing delivered during 2018.

The shortfall was driven by the 787 Dreamliner. While that popular model accounted for half of Boeing's widebody orders (109), Boeing built 145 Dreamliners last year. Furthermore, it plans to boost 787 output in 2019. To maintain a higher production rate, Boeing will need to start winning substantially more orders for the Dreamliner. Furthermore, the only reason orders outpaced production for the other three aircraft families is that Boeing has reduced output of those models in recent years.

However, Airbus is in even worse shape on this score. During all of 2018, it captured just 27 net orders for the A330 family, 40 net orders for the A350 family, and four net A380 orders. The A220 and A320 narrowbody families accounted for more than 90% of Airbus' net orders last year.

Of Airbus' three widebody aircraft families, only the A350 has a healthy order backlog. The A380 is already on life support, with no meaningful orders remaining from any customers other than Emirates. The A330neo could join it without an improvement in demand in the near future. For 2019, Airbus must prioritize driving sales of its widebody models to avoid the need for further production cuts.

The company will hold a ceremonial groundbreaking next week for its second Final Assembly Line (FAL) at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. The new FAL will produce the new A220 family of passenger jets. Airbus has said it plans to deliver its first Mobile-built A220 in 2020; the latest announcement says it plans to begin A220 assembly work in 2019.

According to information released Wednesday by the company, newly announced positions ""are the first wave of production jobs announced for the company's A220 aircraft assembly line."" Open positions include aircraft structure/installation mechanics, installers for aircraft cabin furnishings and aircraft electricians.

""Successful candidates for all positions will participate in several weeks of training at AIDT in a combination of classroom and on-the-job training,"" according to Wednesday's announcement. ""Some candidates will also have the opportunity for on-the-job training with the company's manufacturing team in Mirabel, Canada before returning to Mobile. Production on the first aircraft begins in Q3 2019.""

The A220 jets were developed by Bombardier, which produces them at a facility in Mirabel. Building a second assembly line in the United States is in keeping with Airbus' strategy of using multiple production sites to meet global demand. Mobile is among four cities where the company produces its larger A320 family of jets.

Airbus has several large orders in hand for A220s. Industry sources reported Wednesday that Delta had upgraded its order, going from 75 to 90 jets and converted 25 of its orders from the A220-100 model to the larger A220-300. A report by FlightGlobal.com said Delta expects to have all 90 A220s by 2023.

The company says that for the first wave of hiring, it prefers candidates to have at least two years of experience in aerospace or aviation production. The anticipated 600 jobs include new employees on the established FAL; Airbus says it also is hiring now for that line.

Investigations are ongoing to understand if any specific data was targeted, however we do know some personal data was accessed. This is mostly professional contact and IT identification details of some Airbus employees in Europe.

After detecting the security breach incident, Airbus started an investigation to pinpoint the causes behind the cyber incident and to put in place countermeasures designed to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The official statement says:

This incident is being thoroughly investigated by Airbus’ experts who have taken immediate and appropriate actions to reinforce existing security measures and to mitigate its potential impact, as well as determining its origins.

Airbus also said that it is currently in contact with ""the relevant regulatory authorities and the data protection authorities pursuant to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).""

Additionally, all employees have been advised to take all possible precautions to make sure that their data will not be exposed in the event of a future Airbus data breach incident.

BleepingComputer contacted Airbus asking for more details but did not receive an answer prior to publication. We will update whenever that changes.

Two weeks ago, potential attackers could view and change private information in flight bookings made by millions of customers of 140 major international airlines because of a security issue in the Amadeus online booking system.

Also, back in October 2018, the Cathay Pacific airline announced that one IT system containing passenger data for up to 9.4 million passengers was breached by attackers who accessed customers' phone numbers, emails, addresses, passport numbers, more."

MOBILE, Al. (Reuters) - Airbus expanded its industrial presence in the United States on Wednesday, preparing to breaking ground on a new assembly plant for the A220, 18 months after agreeing to buy the Canadian jetliner in the midst of a U.S.-Ottawa trade row.

The European planemaker said it would invest $300 million and create 400 jobs in the new facility, to be built in the port city of Mobile alongside an existing assembly line for its best-selling A320 passenger jet, which already employs 700 people.

It said Alabama would provide an unspecified amount in state incentives to support the development.

Airbus plans to use the site to assemble the 110-130-seat A220 for U.S. airlines, who have ordered some 250 of the planes including 135 since Airbus took control last July.

Airbus's decision to place some output in the United States was initially seen as a trade boost for Canada after Boeing accused its developer Bombardier of dumping the foreign-made jet at low-ball prices to win a deal with Delta Air Lines.

Although Boeing ultimately lost its trade case, Airbus said it still made sense to serve U.S. demand from the Alabama site.

""The United States is one of the largest markets for us and this is our largest industrial base in the U.S. We have the skills and employees and it is the logical thing to do,"" Knittel said.

Airbus plans to build 4 A220s a month in Alabama with the first jet to be delivered in 2020. The Montreal base where the aircraft was developed is running at some 2.75 A220 jets a month with plans to raise capacity to 10 a month by the mid-2020s.

The Alabama production line for the larger A320, which opened in 2015, produces 4.5 aircraft a month and this could rise to 5 a month by the end of the year, Knittel said.

PARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates is exploring switching some orders for the world's largest jetliner, the Airbus A380, to the smaller A350 in a move raising new doubts about the future of Europe's iconic superjumbo, people familiar with the matter said.

The Gulf carrier, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in more than 100 A380s, has been struggling to finalize a deal to buy another 36 to keep assembly lines open, due to differences with engine maker Rolls-Royce.

Now, Airbus is looking closely at closing A380 factories sooner than expected as part of a reshuffle of orders, with Chief Executive Tom Enders unlikely to leave the situation unresolved when his mandate ends in April, they said.

A person familiar with the matter said Airbus was looking ""extremely seriously"" at setting the timetable for a shutdown but said no decision had been taken.

Airbus said in a statement after Reuters first published news of the talks that it ""confirms it is in discussions with Emirates airline in relation to its A380 contract"". But it said details of negotiations were confidential.

Emirates and Rolls-Royce declined to comment.

The A380s have been used to promote a luxury lifestyle with the Emirates brand, featuring lounges and showers on board, and were part of the set for a 2017 advertisement with Hollywood actor Jennifer Aniston. It says the jets, some with over 600 seats, have helped the airline at slot-constrained airports.

But sales of such four-engined planes are tumbling as many airlines switch to smaller and less thirsty twin-engined jets like the A350 and Boeing 777 due to improving size and range.

Emirates announced the lifeline order for up to 36 superjumbos worth as much as $16 billion at list prices a year ago, throwing a lifeline to the program's roughly 3,000 workers and securing its future for at least another decade.

But a year-long impasse between Emirates and Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings has so far blocked the order.

Story continues

WORKAROUND

Airbus is trying to broker a complex workaround which could see Emirates take smaller jets also powered by Rolls-Royce while it tries to secure homes for as many A380s as possible, with British Airways recently expressing interest.

Airbus has dangled the prospect of closing A380 production before, and industry sources say such maneuvers can be a negotiating tactic and the talks remain difficult to predict.

But time is running out for the A380 with few airlines willing to spend the sums invested by Emirates, which has made it a backbone of its global network alongside the Boeing 777.

The production line is ""untenable"", a senior industry source said. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said closing production could release capacity for painting and other future production.

If confirmed, a decision by Emirates to order the A350 would ease a separate headache for Airbus and engine partner Rolls-Royce after Emirates axed an A350 order in 2014.

Airbus and Rolls are keen to maintain a foothold at the largest Arab carrier and prevent Boeing filling the gap with more of its General Electric-powered 777s. The A350 competes with both the Boeing 777 and smaller 787.

Any deal depends on the backing of Emirates which sources say holds many of the cards in the sometimes heated discussions.

Rolls continues to owe the Dubai carrier penalties for underperformance on Trent 900 engines already in its A380 fleet, giving Emirates leverage to win a good deal on A350 engine maintenance.

Also likely to weigh a game plan, analysts said, is Boeing. It blocked an earlier Airbus bid to put the A350 back in Emirates with a draft deal for 40 787s in 2017, and is seen likely to renew the effort as it negotiates to close the deal.

The European aircraft maker said 120 passenger aircraft ordered by JetBlue Airways and the startup airline Moxy will be built in a new factory near the company's existing plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Construction on the plant will begin later this month, the company said.

JetBlue and Moxy each ordered 60 of the A220-300 aircraft manufactured by Airbus. The plant will be located beside a factory where Airbus already produces the A320 aircraft in Mobile.

The A220, with 100 to 150 passenger seats, used to be known as the Canadian Bombardier C-Series, but Airbus bought the program after Boeing pushed a trade war over it.

Airbus, with nearly 500 employees on the coast, produced its first airplane in Mobile in 2016. The new A220 line in Alabama is in addition to one the company is opening in Mirabel, Canada.

Aside from Airbus, aerospace projects in the region include NASA centers in Louisiana and Mississippi and an extensive military aviation presence in the Florida Panhandle."

The new wreck follows the 2016 sinking of an Airbus A300 and a Douglas DC3 ‘Dakota’ in 2009.

At 65m in length and with a wingspan of 60m, the latest addition to Turkey’s growing list of underwater aircraft is thought to be the longest in the world. The decommissioned aircraft was sunk as part of an arrangement between the tourist authorities and TANAP, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline Project.

The Airbus, which entered service in 1995 and retired in 2018, was dismantled in Antalya earlier this year by Skyair shop aviation. After transporting the parts to İbrice, the team from Skyair reassembled the aircraft before floating it out to sea on an inflatable raft and sinking it to a depth of around 30m, approximately one nautical mile from İbrice Harbour in Edirne province.

It is hoped that the new attraction will bring tourism to the area as a scuba diving hotspot. ‘The plane wreck will provide a great benefit to both nature and divers,’ said Özkan Arsu, Turkish Underwater Sports Federation representative of Edirne, during an interview.

Over the last few days there’s been many rumors about various Airbus results for 2018, with some saying negative or positive things about them, however now these can be put down or confirmed now that Airbus has released their results.

The company successfully met their 2018 delivery goal of 800 aircraft, setting a new company record and keeping them on path for future growth and delivery guidance. Compared to 2017s 718 deliveries, 2018 is an 11% increase, which is a significant amount. This continues Airbus’ 16 year trend of increasing deliveries per year.

Below are the results for the company in a table:

Aircraft Deliveries 2018 Deliveries 2017 A220 20 (since July 2018) — A320 626 (386 A320neo Family) 558 (181 A320neos) A330 49 (3 A330-900s) 67 A350 93 78 A380 12 15

Airbus saw a reduction in orders in 2018, with net orders totaling 747 compared to 1109 in 2017. A new industry record is stated to be set by Airbus, with 7577 aircraft in their backlog, of which, 480 are the recently introduced A220s. This is compared to the 7265 achieved in 2017.

Guillaume Faury, President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, reflected on 2018 in the this strong statement:

“Despite significant operational challenges, Airbus continued its production ramp-up and delivered a record number of aircraft in 2018. I salute our teams around the globe who worked until the end of the year to meet our requirements. I am equally pleased about the healthy order intake as it shows the underlying strength of the commercial aircraft market and the trust of our customers are placing in is. My gratitude goes out to all of them for their ongoing support. As we look to further increase our industrial efficiency, we will continue making the digitalisation of our business a key priority.”

The operational challenges mentioned are similar to what Boeing faced in 2018, with supplier issues causing chaos among production lines, specifically for fuselages and engines. Pratt and Whitney GTF woes eased up, however still had Airbus tied down in terms of A320neo capacity.

Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines for the A350 have been performing excellently, however very minor delays were present due to Rolls-Royce focusing their lines on Trent 1000 repairs, which has ultimately led to the Trent 7000 engine on the A330neo to be delayed.

Additionally, the ongoing management changes and the rapid departure of John Leahy’s replacement, Eric Schulz, meant Airbus had to constantly whip up emergency/quick replacements of crucial members.

Airbus’ presence in Hamburg, Toulouse, Tianjin, Mobile and Mirabel is what allowed for this years delivery target to be achieved and increased over the years. Production of the A320 family is on track to achieve a rate of 60 per month by mid-2019 thanks to ongoing assembly line modernization and expansion.

With the Beluga XL now on its way, Airbus’ next step is to prepare for greater production to clear their backlog, allowing for more orders to flow in. The A350, which has now achieved the company goal of 10 per month, will benefit this as the Beluga XL will have the capability to carry two wings rather than the one on the A300-based Belugas.

Just like Boeing, Airbus has had a great year, and with 2019 slowing down for new aircraft developments, the next big focus for the company is refining their industrial and management processes.

A220 airliner wins approval from Transport Canada for 180 minutes ETOPS capability - Airbus,"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMS1hMjIwLWFpcmxpbmVyLXdpbnMtYXBwcm92YWwtZnJvbS10cmFuc3BvcnQtY2FuYWRhLWZvci0xODAtbWludXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The newest addition to the Airbus family of commercial aircraft, the A220, has received 180-minute extended operations (ETOPS*) approval from the Canadian civil aviation authority, Transport Canada. This achievement paves the way for A220 customers to start new direct non-limiting routings over water, remote or underserved regions.

“This A220 ETOPS milestone adds to the numerous performance capabilities which the unbeatable A220 Family already offers,” said Florent Massou, Head of Airbus’ A220 Programme.

“Being the only in-production aircraft in its class capable of performing both steep approach and long-range operations, the A220 is definitely unlocking new route opportunities for airlines,” added Rob Dewar, Head of Engineering and Customer Support, A220 Programme.

The A220 is the first commercial airliner to obtain domestic ETOPS certification from Transport Canada. This capability is available as an option for A220-100 and A220-300 operators, enabling them to fly for up to 180-minutes from the nearest diversion airport.

As the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market, the A220 delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and true widebody comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The aircraft brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least a 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. With a range of up to 3,200 nautical miles (5,920 km), the A220 offers the performance of larger single aisle aircraft.

With an order book of over 537 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market.

*Notes for Editors:

“ETOPS” is a set of rules initially introduced by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in the mid-1980s to allow commercial operations with twin-engine aircraft on routes beyond 60 minutes flying time from the nearest airport and which were previously operated only by aircraft with more than two engines. These rules, which are now named “EDTO” (Extended Diversion Time Operations) by ICAO have been progressively revised to allow operations up to or beyond 180 minutes diversion time.

The company also booked 148 orders for light twin-engine helicopters of the H135/H145 family and secured 15 orders for the nextgeneration H160. At the end of last year, the overall backlog increased to 717 helicopters.

“Our commercial performance in 2018 demonstrates the resilience we have developed as a company to help us navigate what remains a challenging environment,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “Even though the civil & parapublic market remains at a low level worldwide, we have managed to maintain our global leadership thanks to our wide and modern portfolio of products and services and our international footprint. Meanwhile, we have increased our market share in the military sector by securing major contracts with leading armed forces worldwide, with best-in-class solutions. These positive trends give us the means to prepare the future and continue our transformation, with innovation at our core and customer loyalty at heart.”

In 2018, Airbus Helicopters delivered the first of 100 H135s for China in Qingdao, where a dedicated final assembly line will serve the growing demand of the Chinese market for civil & parapublic helicopters. Meanwhile, Hong Kong Government Flying Service took delivery of the first H175s in public services configuration.

Last year also proved successful for the Super Puma family which demonstrated its versatility by being selected in key military campaigns, while attracting new civil & parapublic customers with repurposed H225s previously operated on the oil & gas market. Likewise, 2018 proved to be a very positive year for the NH90, which attracted orders for 28 units in Qatar while being selected by Spain in the frame of a follow-on order for 23 units.

Key programme milestones were achieved in 2018, including the power-on and ground testing of the CityAirbus electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) technology demonstrator, ahead of a maiden flight expected early 2019. The first H160 in serial configuration entered flight trials in 2018, while the VSR700 unmanned aerial system demonstrator performed its first unmanned flights at the end of the year.

Footnote: The Full-Year 2018 net orders and backlog represent the contractual view. The Full-Year 2018 backlog value will be measured under IFRS 15 and will reflect the recoverable amount of revenues under these contracts. The FY 2017 backlog will not be restated.
