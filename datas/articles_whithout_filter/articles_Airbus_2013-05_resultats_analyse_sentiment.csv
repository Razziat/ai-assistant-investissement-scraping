"Airbus doesn’t have the appetite to build a 777X competitor, says Boeing CEO - Skift Travel News","Wed, 22 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDUvMjIvYm9laW5nLWNlby1zYXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1kb2VzbnQtaGF2ZS10aGUtYXBwZXRpdGUtdG8tYnVpbGQtYS03Nzd4LWNvbXBldGl0b3Iv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAxMy8wNS8yMi9ib2VpbmctY2VvLXNheXMtYWlyYnVzLWRvZXNudC1oYXZlLXRoZS1hcHBldGl0ZS10by1idWlsZC1hLTc3N3gtY29tcGV0aXRvci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing is hard-pressed for Airbus insults as the moment as its European competitor continues to snap up deals with new customers in the aftermath of the Dreamliner grounding.

Boeing Co.’s experience developing the composite-plastic Dreamliner has helped the planemaker attain a five-year advantage over Airbus SAS in twin-aisle jets, Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said.

The lighter-weight material will be deployed on the wings of the 777X, an upgrade of Boeing’s biggest twin-engine model, which the company began marketing this year. Chicago-based Boeing is betting that the plane, which will also have more- efficient engines, will cement its lead in the market for wide- body jets typically used on long-haul routes.

Airbus doesn’t “have an airframe that can compete with the 777X,” McNerney said today at an investor conference. “They don’t have the appetite to do a ground-up airplane, and they’d have to do a ground-up airplane.”

Boeing, which is targeting a commercial debut for the 777X near the end of the decade, doesn’t yet have board approval to start production. The largest version of Airbus’s competing A350, the -1000, is scheduled for delivery in 2017.

Boeing climbed 0.2 percent to $98.93 at 9:31 a.m. after a previous gain of 31 percent this year. The stock still trades at a 21 percent discount to Airbus parent European, Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.

Piloting the Airbus A380 in a flight simulator - Fox News,"Thu, 30 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9waWxvdGluZy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaW4tYS1mbGlnaHQtc2ltdWxhdG9y0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3BpbG90aW5nLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1pbi1hLWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3IuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I don’t play video games, and probably I never will now that I’ve landed an Airbus A380 at airports all over the world in a flight simulator. Because really, what video game could ever compare with manning the joystick in a multi-million dollar “sim”?



I knew that my first flight simulator experience would be a blast, which is why I flew all the way to London’s Heathrow Airport and the British Airways training center, but it wasn’t prepared for how thrilling it would be (yes, like many boys, I used to fantasize about being a pilot one day).

[pullquote]

BA will be launching its A380 service between Los Angeles and London and London and Hong Kong later this year, and I was one of the lucky few to grab a slot for a couple of hours in their new A380 simulator.



For those of you who have never taken the controls of a simulator, these sophisticated machines are enclosed cockpits resting on moveable mechanical legs that, as the name implies, simulate flight and are used for flight crew training purposes.

The controls, video displays, seats and other features are identical to a real cockpit, and the windows are actually video screens that can be programmed to show airport terminals, taxiways, runways, topographical features, and weather conditions. The simulator pods tilt, lurch and even rumble to recreate real-life take off and flight conditions, and speakers broadcast sounds (jet and wind noise, landing gear and flap movement, the thud of landing, even the sound and movement of the tires bumping along the taxiway).



Under the guidance of an experienced BA captain, I took my sheepskin-upholstered seat and got a tour of the controls. At my left hand was a joystick; at my right the four levers that controlled the mighty jet’s engines; at my feet, pedals used to slow down or brake the plane on the ground.

Other controls worked the flaps and landing gear and switched the auto pilot off and on. I was surprised to see that this plane has no “steering wheel.” The joystick and pedals control all directional movement on the ground.



After watching a typical take off and landing performed by my instructor, it was my turn. Where would I like to go? Tokyo? Manhattan? Hong Kong?

The computers were programmed, I released the brakes, and we were “towed” out to the taxi way. It was now my job to slowly position the aircraft for take off. After giving the engines a bit of thrust I placed my left hand on the joystick, and was surprised at how sensitive it was. Only minute movements are necessary, and had this been an actual take off someone on the ground would have assumed I was inebriated as I swerved back and forth.

The simulator’s speakers broadcast engine noises and the simulator pod rumbled a bit as we passed over “imperfections” in the taxiway. Once at the head of the runway, I applied the brakes and then placed my right hand on the four throttle levers, pushing them forward in unison. And away we flew. As we ascended, the simulator tilted and banked. (In fact, the motion was so real that after a few such take offs one member of our party became a bit airsick.)



Outside the “windows” we could see a computer-generated view of greater London. The computer was programmed for a bright sunny day, but with a quick adjustment the “weather” could be switched to turbulent, cloudy, or rainy. And yes, simulated windshield wipers switched on when the rain started “pelting” our craft.



In minutes, we were descending into Hong Kong, my first port of call. I didn’t crash the plane, thankfully, but it wasn’t exactly a smooth landing. I was more successful upon subsequent landings at New York’s JFK and LAX.



One thing I learned was that there’s no such thing as a completely automated take off or landing, even when using the autopilot. Planes do not actually take off and land by themselves, much less position themselves for take off, or bring themselves to the gate.



Does this all sound like fun? That doesn’t begin to describe it. I was giddy, as in joyfully elated. The two hours passed in a flash and all too soon we were back on the ground, literally and figuratively, in London. I’d do it again and again, given the chance.



The British Airways Flight Training website describes the airline’s flight simulator experiences as “the thrill of a lifetime” and that’s no exaggeration. Currently, simulator flights are available in Boeing 737-400, Boeing 757-200, and Boeing 767-300 aircraft (training on the Airbus A380 and other models in the fleet may become available in the future). A one-hour “flight” costs £399 (about $465) or £1197 (about $1800) for a three-hour flight. Gift certificates are available as well. I can’t think of a better present for anyone who ever dreamed of being a pilot. Or for the video game geek on your holiday shopping list. Or for anyone, for that matter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999750852584839}",neutral,0.9999750852584839,0
Airbus Pulls Covers Off New Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Tue, 14 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



1 / 4 Chevron Chevron A350-XWB-out-of-paint-shop1

Airbus pulled its newest airliner, the A350 XWB, out of the paint booth this week and may well be the big story at the upcoming Paris Air Show.

The new airplane, like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, is made largely of composite materials. The two differ in how the composites are used, but both promise significant fuel savings and increased passenger comfort.

The A350 XWB has been coming together with components from suppliers throughout Europe for the past two years or so, and Airbus plans its first flight soon. With the big industry airshow taking place in just over a month, a first flight before the aerospace industry heads to Paris would all but steal the show.

Boeing will be there, of course, and is expected to make further announcements about its next new airplane, an updated version of the successful 777, currently being called the 777X. The company also is likely to celebrate the 787's return to service after two battery meltdowns grounded all 50 Dreamliners worldwide in January. With all of those planes ready to fly again, Boeing announced today that it has resumed Dreamliner deliveries.

The two companies took different approaches to building their composite airliners. Unlike the composite ""barrels"" that come together to create the 787 fuselage, the A350 XWB uses composite panels affixed to a metal composite skeleton frame.

Airbus said today that it is more confident that the airplane will make its first flight ""in the summer,"" but wouldn't be more specific. Depending upon how carefully the company chose its words, that could mean after Paris, which begins June 17 and is, therefore, before the official start of summer.

The company is keenly aware that a first flight is just that, and wants to make sure it is a ""mature flight"" and not a PR stunt held simply to get a plane in the air. The company almost certainly wants to avoid following the same path trod by Boeing, which saw delays and setbacks in the months after the first flight of the 787. In an effort to eliminate one headache Boeing endured, Airbus has abandoned its plan to use lithium-ion batteries and will instead use the more proven and traditional nickel-cadmium cells.

The twin-aisle A350XWB is scheduled to enter service in the middle of next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8993408679962158}",neutral,0.8993408679962158,0

Airbus and EADS innovate with a stealthy building at Blagnac Airport - ATC Network,"Wed, 22 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0Yy1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9hdGMtc2hvd2Nhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtZWFkcy1pbm5vdmF0ZS13aXRoLWEtc3RlYWx0aHktYnVpbGRpbmctYXQtYmxhZ25hYy1haXJwb3J00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, with the support of EADS Innovation Works, has opened the first ""stealthy building"" at the Toulouse Airbus site attached to Blagnac Airport.

EADS and Airbus built the C65 hangar at the airport by equipping the building with specially shaped aluminium panels. These panels prevent the building from disrupting the airport's Instrument Landing System (ILS), which allows aircraft to land in reduced visibility conditions.

For safety reasons, planning permission would not have been granted for the building without these modifications.







Click on Video to watch AeroNews.tv Video about the building

The large façades of buildings pose a problem for aircraft landing systems as they reflect incoming radio waves across the runway, much like a mirror. Such perturbations would cause aircraft to deviate from the runway centreline. For this reason construction is forbidden close to runways unless it can be demonstrated that the building is ‘stealthy’.

However, it is not feasible to apply conventional stealth technology to absorb the incoming waves since this would be prohibitively expensive. Instead the solution applied in Toulouse uses the phenomenon of diffraction to redirect the waves away from the runway. This is the same effect that produces the iridescent colours that are visible when holding up a compact disc up to a source of light. By employing ELISE, an advanced ILS simulation tool developed by Airbus Engineering, EADS Innovation Works and the French Civil Aviation University ENAC it was even possible to demonstrate that it would only be necessary to treat the top 10 metres of the building, leading to a cheaper solution.

EADS Chief Technical Officer Jean Botti said: “The successful completion of this Airbus facility requirement is an example of our commitment to the development of unique technical solutions for our customers and the aerospace industry.”

Airbus ProSky will now sell this technology assisted by the technical support from EADS Innovation Works. Airbus ProSky CEO Paul-Franck Bijou said: “By designing buildings that do not produce reflections, up to 100 square kilometres of non-buildable airport land worldwide could potentially be transformed into space available for construction, such as terminal buildings, maintenance hangars, or even outside airport boundaries like exhibitions centres, hotels and multi storey car parks.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994174242019653}",neutral,0.9994174242019653,0

The A330 Airbus was high above the Atlantic Ocean when the captain decided to abort his flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Manchester. The precautionary measure was taken after smoke was noticed in the cabin.

The aircraft, Thomas Cook Airlines Flight 149, with 338 British holidaymakers on board, landed safely.

A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: ""The emergency was declared as a precaution after smoke was noticed in the cabin. The plane landed safely and all the passengers are fine and being looked after. Tests will now be carried out on the plane and we hope to have everyone back in Manchester later today.

""As always, our passengers' safety is the priority in these situations, but we apologise to everyone on board for the inconvenience this has caused them.""

Investigators are understood to be looking into reports that smoke was seen coming from a passenger's in-flight entertainment screen.

Lt Jay Donawa from the Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service said passengers and crew were safe after the plane was evacuated following the unscheduled landing.

""No injuries were reported and there was no fire on board when the aircraft landed,"" he said.

The pilot decided to divert his aircraft at about 8.20pm (23.20 GMT) Bermuda time and landed 40 minutes later.

Passengers were taken to local hotels while Thomas Cook arranged their onward flight. They are expected to return to Britain later on Wednesday.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9976552724838257}",neutral,0.9976552724838257,0
Catching a Lufthansa Airbus A321’s Rapid Descent Live - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 14 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNS9jYXRjaGluZy1hLWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1haXJidXMtYTMyMXMtcmFwaWQtZGVzY2VudC1saXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Watching airline activity live via social media can have interesting consequences. Last week, I happened to see the #7700 tweet [which are tweets that are auto generated that go out any time an aircraft in coverage squawks 7700] from Planefinder.net as soon as it was posted and went to check out what was happening. Normally when you catch these emergencies, not much happens immediately, and the aircraft either continues on to its destination, or diverts to another airport.

This time I noticed that the aircraft immediately entered a very rapid descent [see an image of normal descent]. In my experience, something like that is usually caused by a loss of cabin pressure, where the pilots level off at 10,000 feet to asses the situation. However, this aircraft passed 10,000 and continued to rapidly descent, which was worrying. Was this a huge emergency, website error or just standard procedure for some issue on the flight?

There were a few moments where I thought I may have been watching a crash of some sort occur in real-time, from thousands of miles away. But thankfully, the pilots were just quick acting, and diverted to a nearby airport.

Lufthansa confirmed to AirlineReporter.com that LH1172 had 151 passengers on board and the captain decided to stopover in Nantes (NTE), France, “due to a medical case (sick passenger).” They confirmed that there was no emergency requested and that the aircraft landed safely .

Watching an emergency occur in real-time and not knowing the outcome at the time is strange. Yes, it lets me break news, literally, as it is happening, but the feeling of not knowing what is truly going on with an emergency aircraft, it’s not a good one.

Unprofitable Sri Lankan Airlines looks to cut costs with revitalized Airbus fleet - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 24 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDUvMjQvdW5wcm9maXRhYmxlLXNyaS1sYW5rYW4tYWlybGluZXMtbG9va3MtdG8tY3V0LWZ1ZWwtY29zdHMtd2l0aC1yZXZpdGFsaXplZC1haXJidXMtZmxlZXQv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAxMy8wNS8yNC91bnByb2ZpdGFibGUtc3JpLWxhbmthbi1haXJsaW5lcy1sb29rcy10by1jdXQtZnVlbC1jb3N0cy13aXRoLXJldml0YWxpemVkLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ flexibility in leasing aircraft to the loss-making airline in the short and long-term won it the deal over Boeing who relentlessly pushed its 787 Dreamliner without an interim offer.

Loss-making national carrier Sri Lankan Airlines has signed a provisional deal with Airbus worth $1.3 billion to buy six A330-300 and four A350-900 aircraft between 2014 and 2023 to replace ageing aircraft, the state-run firm’s CEO told Reuters.

The airline, seeking to modernise its fleet to cut fuel costs, will opt for Rolls-Royce Plc engines and use a lease-back arrangement to conserve cash, Chief Executive Officer Kapila Chandrasena said in an interview.

“The total cost altogether is going to be around $1.3 billion. But deliveries are progressively from 2014 to 2023 on a staggered basis,” he said. The carrier signed a memorandum of understanding on the purchase with Airbus last Friday, he said.

Sri Lankan Airlines now operates with a 22-aircraft fleet including seven A320-200s, seven A330-300s, six A340-300s and two Twin Otters.

Chandrasena said the national carrier needs to replace all six A340-300s with A330-300 aircraft and all seven A330-300s with A350-900s.

Sri Lankan, which had been managed by Dubai’s Emirates Airline for a decade until 2008, aims to achieve a modern and fuel efficient twin-engine fleet by 2023.

The A340 has lost favour with airlines due to the cost of running four engines in an era of high fuel prices. Airlines are switching to lightweight new-technology airplanes such as the carbon-fibre A350 and Boeing Co’s 787 Dreamliner, but sales of the older A330 have held up better than expected due to its availability and competitive pricing, aerospace analysts say.

Boeing offer

Chandrasena said the airlines considered offers by both Airbus and Boeing.

“We looked at who is giving more value for us. In that discussion, it was apparent that the Airbus offer of A330-300s in the interim and long-term A350-900 is much more favourable than the Boeing,” he said.

“Boeing did not have interim aircraft. They were only interested in the long-term offer, which was the 787.”

Sri Lankan Airlines estimates that it incurred a loss of $134.8 million in the 2012/13 financial year to March 31, similar to the previous year, and is finding it difficult to finance new aircraft purchases.

“We don’t have cash,” Chandrasena said. “So what we are doing is a sale and lease.”

He said the airline would work with either a financial institution or a leasing firm that would buy the aircraft and lease them back to the carrier.

He said the national carrier would be looking at a lease period of 10 to 15 years, with a shorter period for the A330-300s and a longer period for the A350-900s.

“We are talking to various (leasing companies) right now about the sale and lease-back on the six 330-300s,” he said.

The airline operates about 253 flights a week out of Colombo to European, Middle Eastern and Asian destinations.

Chandrasena said in February that, with fuel comprising half the airline’s costs, its ageing, inefficient planes were a heavy drain on profit.

It has the extra burden of having to operate unprofitable European routes, because the country’s economy, hard-hit by a 26-year war that ended in 2009, relies heavily on tourism.

The airline, which is 51 percent state-owned, is expected to break even, or be close to that point, in the 2015/16 financial year.

Flying a Dream: Qantas First Class on an Airbus A380 – Part 1 - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 13 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNS9mbHlpbmctYS1kcmVhbS1xYW50YXMtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtcGFydC0xL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I was beginning my day off the way any premium cabin passenger should; spending time in the lounge prior to my flight. But this wasn’t just any lounge and this wasn’t just any flight. For two and a half years I had dreamed and worked towards this day. I had been earning Qantas points purely for this reason: First Class flight on a Qantas Airbus A380.

Arriving at Melbourne Airport I was dropped off in front of the dedicated First Class check-in area, which can be easily missed if you don’t know where to look. Thankfully my driver did know as the check in was hiding behind a line of trees. I was a little too early to check in for my flight, but was able to sit down in the lobby area (which looks almost identical to the First Class lounge).

Free Wifi from the airport kept me going until I was able to check in and once that was done I was handed the coveted Gold Boarding pass holder. My bags were also labeled with the yellow first class tag and I was off through security and immigration. Quick, clean and painless… the only way to fly right?

After winding my way through the endless duty free store and the terminal I went up the escalators and turned right to the lounge entrance. I was ready to enter my new.

Sydney and Melbourne both host Qantas First Class Lounges. These two lounges are reputed to be among the best in the world. Melbourne’s lounge is like the little brother to Sydney since it has all the same bells and whistles, just a little bit smaller. But Melbourne doesn’t have as many first class flights as Sydney, so that is to be expected.

Only first class passengers or the very top tier of One World frequent fliers (Emerald) can access the lounge. This means there are never more than a handful of people in there at one time. When I arrived, it was me and two other guests.

The staff are all trained by Sofitel the Luxury hotel chain of french hotels from Accor. So you feel like you’re entering a luxury hotel more than an airline lounge.

The atmosphere of the lounge was wonderful and for good reason: it was designed by Marc Newson. The seats, the tables, the chairs everything. The seats looked fantastic and the design was clean, functional and stylish all mixed into one — I loved it.

There were several different areas of the lounge where you could relax with a book or watch TV. There were even two fully enclosed offices, stocked with all the business essentials, so you can keep working right up until flight time.

There is one (well kinda of two) thing in the lounge that will likely catch your eye: the two old ’œclick clack’ style departure boards. These are extremely rare, and to see two of them in the one place is amazing.

While I took a heap of photos and explored, the staff were doing everything to get me fed. No worries, it was early in the morning and I was definitely planning on eating.

Sure, I could have selected a small snack off the side buffet, but this is First Class and they also offered a full restaurant. I was shown to a table by the window (just like any AvGeek right?) and the menu just took me for a spin. So many options… what to choose? Do I go light, do I go healthy? My head was swimming with choices. No matter what I chose, I knew it was going to be good. The entire menu is designed by Neil Perry and his Rockpool group.

Bonus: Qantas First Class Lounge Melbourne Spring Breakfast Menu

Perry is one of Australia’s top chefs and he designs the menus and food for all Qantas flights in First & Business class. I decided that since this was meant to be an indulgent day I was going the whole hog! Buffalo milk yoghurt with honey and toasted almonds, fresh fruit, toasted rye bread from one of the best bakeries in Australia, an omelette loaded with goodies and of course… bacon.

With a loaded belly full of breakfast and coffee (did I mention they have a fully stocked bar and a barista?), what more is there to do? Well it was time for my massage!

Bonus: Qantas First Class Lounge Melbourne Full Gallery

The lounge has it’s own day spa run in conjunction with Payot. Each lounge guest is entitled to a 30 minute treatment of their choice. Facials, massages, you name it, you can have it. Add that into the fully stocked bathrooms and you can enjoy a relaxing massage and shower, feeling 100% refreshed after a long day in the office or flying. The view wasn’t too bad either.

My head was filled with excitement and I didn’t even want to leave the lounge it was so amazing. The only thing that could make me leave was that first class seat on the Qantas Airbus A380. I will be telling you about that flight in future stories.

Airbus introduces new C4you support for corporate jet customers - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 22 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vYzR5b3Utc3VwcG9ydF8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo and press release from Airbus:

Airbus is introducing a new corporate jet customer care centre (C4you) for its private jet customers, aimed at providing dedicated access to an experienced team.

Customers will be able to get technical advice on both their airframe and their cabin through a single point of contact , and will also be able to benefit from packaged services, such as arrangements to implement service bulletins (SBs).

They will be able to benefit from the more than 120 years of experience of a team of four dedicated professionals, co-located within Airbus’ Airtac centre in Toulouse, who will be complemented by field service representatives that are based in Asia and the Middle East.

In addition to flying fewer hours than airliners, corporate jets are typically operated by small teams , and Airbus has long recognised the need to provide additional support to complement the technical advice, training and spares that is provided to all of its 500-plus customers and operators.

The new C4you service thus adds to the tailored support that Airbus already provides to its private jet customers, through services such as dedicated customer support directors, low utilisation maintenance programmes, and flight hour services.

The aim is to help customers and operators get the best out of their Airbus aircraft, by helping them to fly efficiently, as well as safely, whatever their operation, and wherever they fly.

Airbus corporate jets share the same basic airframes and engines as the world’s most modern airliner family, from which they are derived.

They differ mainly in having private cabins and, in the case of those derived from the A320 Family, additional features – such as extra fuel-tanks for intercontinental range, built-in airstairs for airport autonomy and a richer specification.

This means that Airbus corporate jet customers benefit from the robust reliability that comes from an aircraft that has been designed for the rigours of airline service, and that they are never far from the training and maintenance facilities of other operators, almost everywhere that they fly.

Airbus corporate jets have won more than 170 sales to date, and are flying on every continent, including Antarctica.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998944997787476}",positive,0.9998944997787476,1

Singapore Airlines Connects with AvGeeks at LAX - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNS9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtY29ubmVjdHMtd2l0aC1hdmdlZWtzLWF0LWxheC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Singapore Airlines came to me and pitched doing something with a small group of AvGeeks at LAX to watch their Airbus A380 land and depart, I was instantly interested and with almost no details said, “yes please.”

Almost five years ago, when I started AirlineReporter.com, I had a hard time defining this passion that I had for airlines and aviation. Once I gained some readers and was able to start defining who we all are (we are AvGeeks), very few airlines got it.

I don’t blame them. It is hard to get how to interact with this group of people that dedicate a large portion of their lives with airliners. Either researching, looking at photos, taking their own photos, flying on them or in my case blogging on them. But we are a force and some airlines, like Singapore, are starting to get who we are — and they like us.

As the details of this special AvGeek event (which we started calling #SQLAX) evolved, I realized that our group of AvGeeks were probably going to enjoy themselves.

Singapore Airlines is known around the world as one of the leaders of providing a high-level product and service. This event was to be no different. They reserved the entire observation deck of the Theme building and catered it with Dom Prignon and Krug champagne, not to mention high-end hor d’oeuvres. A truly first class AvGeek affair.

As we got set up, there was a group of four gentlemen (not on the invite list) who came over and asked nicely if they could stay. They are from the UK and just wanted to spend the day spotting airplanes and would be no bother.

They had no idea the party they were crashing and were more than welcome to stick around and spot away. Turned out that one of them even worked for Singapore Airlines at Heathrow. They were among great company.

The heat haze was pretty bad, and honestly, the observation deck on top of the Theme building (which is free and open to the public normally) isn’t the best spotting place at the airport, but it did not matter. We all stood around talking more about airlines and aviation, being surrounded by the airlines more than actually taking photos. We all did stop to watch and photograph certain flights, like SQ11/SQ12, Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 that flies from LAX to Singapore via Tokyo.

As I do more of these AvGeek events (DorkFest and Aviation Geek Fest), I realize the people truly are the best part of the event.

Stay tuned. We already have Aviation Geek Fest 2014 in the works (sign up for the AGF14 email list) and there might be other opportunities to connect before then. Until then — keep on spotting and loving airlines.

Airbus Military readies winglet-equipped C295W for market - Flightglobal,"Wed, 29 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXJlYWRpZXMtd2luZ2xldC1lcXVpcHBlZC1jMjk1dy1mb3ItbWFya2V0LzEwOTkzMy5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has detailed a schedule to bring a winglet-equipped enhancement of its C295 medium transport into operational use from the fourth quarter of 2014.

Dubbed the C295W, the future build standard will incorporate a strengthened wing to allow the installation of the metallic winglets, with the entire modification package to add 90kg (198lb) to the transport's weight, the company says.

Craig Hoyle/Flightglobal

Combined with an increase in available power from the aircraft's Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 engines, the winglets will boost payload, climb, altitude and cruise performance, especially when operating in hot environmental conditions and from high airfields.

Flight testing already performed using winglets as part of risk-reduction work for a proposed airborne early warning and control system variant of the C295 also demonstrated an average 4% reduction in fuel consumption, says Gustavo Garcia Miranda, Airbus Military's head of market development. The proposed surveillance version of the aircraft would have a maximum altitude of 26,000ft (7,930m) and an almost 9h endurance with the winglets installed, he adds.

Commercial activities linked to the C295W will be launched before the end of May 2013, following the completion of an analysis of handling qualities linked to a preliminary design. A design freeze is expected during September, and certification from Spain's INTA airworthiness authority is being targeted for the second quarter of 2014.

Airbus Military displayed a winglet-equipped C295W demonstrator at its San Pablo final assembly site in Seville, Spain on 29 May. The airframe modification will also be available as a retrofit option for existing operators, the company says.

""We have a second wave of new tanker contracts, and a high probability to secure the majority of them in 2013,"" Rafael Tentor, head of programmes for light and medium aircraft and derivatives, said during a briefing at Airbus Military's San Pablo site in Seville, Spain on 29 May.

Airbus Military Current users of the A330 MRTT include the Royal Saudi Air Force

The European company will table a best and final offer for a six-aircraft requirement in Singapore on 30 May, Tentor says. Further details of the bid are not being disclosed at this stage of the competition, which also involves the Boeing 767-based KC-46, in development for the US Air Force.

Also on 30 May, Airbus Military will present a ""binding offer"" to France for a fleet of between 12 and 14 three-point tankers, Tentor says. France would become the first MRTT customer to receive A330s equipped with a cargo door, also enabling the type to carry freight loads on its upper deck, he adds.

Meanwhile, the Indian government is expected to soon clear its planned purchase of an initial six A330 tankers, with Tentor saying that all documentation has now been agreed with the customer. A contract could be received as soon as September, but ""within the year-end most likely,"" he adds, with the Indian air force order also to include options for additional examples.

Longer-term, Tentor also believes the A330 will be a candidate for the USAF's future KC-Y tanker requirement. ""We will be there; we will play the match,"" he says. Other potential sales targets for the MRTT cited by the company include Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia and Oman, along with possible repeat sales to Australia and Saudi Arabia.

Fourteen A330 MRTT aircraft are currently operation with the air forces of Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UK and the United Arab Emirates, says Tentor, with this figure to increase to 17 before the end of 2013. Airbus Military will deliver its fifth Voyager tanker/transport to the UK on 29 May, with its sixth example to follow before the end of June.

06.05.2013 LISTEN

Travellers were left fearing for their lives after an airplane engine burst into flames thousands of feet above ground.

Minutes after the flight took off from a Helsinki airport with 168 people on board, the engine exploded and caught fire.

The German-bound Airbus suffered a number of technical problems before streaks of flames emitted from the left engine, 15 minutes after leaving ground.

A blast rocked the Lufthansa Airbus A321-200 and eye witnesses reported hearing grinding noises before a number of bangs resonated through the fuselage.

The plane's engine stalled and cut out while the blaze ripped through the aircraft, leaving it flying with just one engine.

Pilots battled to control the jet and immediately U-turned to Helsinki, making an emergency landing just 20 minutes after taking off at around 6pm on Saturday.

A spokesman for Helsinki-Vantaa airport said: 'A Lufthansa flight had to make an emergency landing at Helsinki airport on Saturday evening due to a glitch in the plane's engine.'

'The Frankfurt-bound flight took off from Helsinki airport, but the pilot brought the aircraft back to Helsinki after about an hour later as a mechanical glitch was detected in its engine.

'The pilot informed the airport control tower about the problems developed in the engine.'

The aircraft managed to land safely at Helsinki airport without suffering any injuries and the 162 passengers and six crew members were taken to a hotel.

A full investigation has now been launched by the airliner and Airbus to determine the exact cause of the accident.

The French-based firm, who produce the world's largest plane the A380, are yet to confirm if they will be suspending further flights of the A321.

Cloud computing: Airbus to offer Dell PCs for pilots on A320 jets - Neowin,"Fri, 10 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy9jbG91ZC1jb21wdXRpbmctYWlyYnVzLXRvLW9mZmVyLWRlbGwtcGNzLWZvci1waWxvdHMtb24tYTMyMC1qZXRzL9IBXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvYW1wL2Nsb3VkLWNvbXB1dGluZy1haXJidXMtdG8tb2ZmZXItZGVsbC1wY3MtZm9yLXBpbG90cy1vbi1hMzIwLWpldHMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The growth of the smartphone and tablet segments has had a huge impact on the way we engage with technology, an impact that has spread into businesses, which continue to explore new ways of improving processes and driving efficiencies through the use of leaner mobile devices. One industry that has warmly welcomed such technologies is aviation, from engineers using devices to gain easy access to schematics while servicing aircraft, to flight attendants using tablets on board to provide better, more personalised service to their passengers.

Pilots with many major airlines have also seen such devices improve the way that they work. Flight crew must carry with them a ‘flight bag’ of documentation, including operating manuals for their aircraft, navigational charts, checklists, logbooks and licences; in its paper form, this documentation can weigh around 15kg, and each pilot will go through thousands of sheets of paper a year in keeping it up to date. The advent of the ‘electronic flight bag’ (EFB), which offers digital versions of the requisite paperwork on a mobile computing device, has dramatically reduced this burden for pilots.

While many carriers - including American Airlines and Alaska Airlines - have opted for the convenience of tablets for their EFBs, Airbus has announced a partnership with Dell to offer an EFB solution on its A320 family of passenger airliners, which will see Dell Latitude notebooks, rather than tablets, deployed to those airlines that wish to offer it to their flight crews. While the arrangement initially covers only the A320 family – which includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321 narrow-body jets – the door is open to extend it to other aircraft in the Airbus range, including the forthcoming A350 XWB wide-body, and the mighty A380 super-jumbo.

While the joint press release from Airbus and Dell does not specify the exact devices that will be offered, Engadget reports that the Latitude E6330 will be the sole notebook supported, at least initially. The E6330 is offered in a variety of configurations by Dell, with Intel Core i3 and i5 processors and up to 4GB of RAM. It weighs around 3.5lb (roughly 1.6kg), and includes an optical drive.

While the E6330 is generally made available with Windows 7 Professional, it’s not clear whether this will be the OS installed on the devices or if Windows 8 will be offered instead. The PCs will come with proprietary FlySmart with Airbus software pre-installed, and will connect the laptops “to the aircraft cockpit via a certified connection”. The two companies state that the EFB solution “complies with strict aviation regulations and offers dependable security and in-depth data and device-management options.”

Photos and video of the jet in the air and on the ground appear to confirm smoke from the right engine and loss of cowling components on both engines.

Fire and rescue met the aircraft on the ground and passengers exited via emergency slides. Following the event, BA shut down all its short-haul flights at the airport until 4 p.m. The incident reportedly caused 186 flight cancellations as Heathrow briefly closed both runways. A reporter for Sky News who was on a different flight inbound to Heathrow said passengers were told they were being delayed due to a bird strike aboard another aircraft. The carrier says it has launched a full investigation working with the Air Accident Investigation Bureau to determine cause.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7029977440834045}",neutral,0.7029977440834045,0
Airbus A350’s paint job points to Paris-show blow for Boeing | Mint - Mint,"Tue, 14 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Qb2xpdGljcy92UXRxOEg1WFE4QWp1TDRmR3Zzb3VML0FpcmJ1cy1BMzUwcy1wYWludC1qb2ItcG9pbnRzLXRvLVBhcmlzc2hvdy1ibG93LWZvci1Cb2VpbmcuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvdlF0cThINVhROEFqdUw0Zkd2c291TC9BaXJidXMtQTM1MHMtcGFpbnQtam9iLXBvaW50cy10by1QYXJpc3Nob3ctYmxvdy1mb3ItQm9laW5nLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse: Airbus SAS engineers are working 13- hour days to get the company’s latest A350 plane off the ground in time to scoop the headlines at next month’s Paris air show.

A flight around the year’s biggest aviation expo, starting 17June, would let Airbus steal the limelight from Boeing Co., which aims to use the event to spur orders for an updated 777 and revitalize the 787 program hit by a months-long grounding.

Getting the wide-body A350 aloft would repeat Airbus’s splash at the last Paris show in 2011, which the European manufacturer dominated with $44 billion worth of orders for the A320neo. While Boeing hit back at the 2012 Farnborough jamboree in England with a welter of deals for the 737 Max, the 787 troubles has taken the gloss off its French prospects.

A first flight by Paris would bring a huge credibility boost for Airbus just as people are having doubts about Boeing’s execution, according to Richard Aboulafia, vice president of US-based Teal Group, who says the 787’s woes and slow progress with the 777 revamp give Airbus a window of opportunity.

The long-range A350 is designed to take on both Boeing models, with the 300-seat A350-900 — the first to fly — and the smaller A350-800 competing with the 787 and 777-200, and the A350-1000, seating 350, challenging the 777-300ER and new 777X. The mid-sized version costs $287.7 million at list price.

Paris primer

Airbus’s first new jet since the A380 superjumbo won’t need to appear in Paris to be the top talking point, with a maiden takeoff from the Toulouse production site likely to be enough to outshine Boeing. The chances of a flight during the event rose when the first operational plane emerged from the paint shop on Monday, replete with an Airbus logo and A350 name on its white fuselage.

EADS chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm called the A350 program challenging today, an attribute the company has used in the past to describe the project. Still, the company is more confident of a first flight by this summer. The important thing is that it’s a mature first flight, Wilhelm said on a call to discuss EADS’s first-quarter earnings.

With the A350 due to enter commercial service with Qatar Airlines Ltd. by the end of next year, achieving a timely first flight would be a coup for Airbus after the 787 made its initial takeoff two years late and began deliveries three years overdue.

‘Biggest lessons’

That’s before the Dreamliner was pulled from service in January, triggering a near five-month grounding. The European company’s own A380 was also handed over three years late and has so far failed to make any money for the manufacturer.

Airbus is in a position to land a blow against Boeing in Paris after taking a conservative approach in developing the A350 that sought to avoid the pitfalls of previous projects.

Buyers have been given a strict list of cabin options, after unlimited choice on the A380 led to complex wiring that caused delays. And while the A350 is half-composite, its fuselage has a skeletal structure overlaid with light composite panels instead of the more radical full-barrel composite sections of the 787.

Airbus has also been less aggressive in using electrical power to run plane functions, relying to a greater extent on bleed power, or hot air pulled from engines instead of heavy electrical generation on-board. After the 787’s grounding over glitches with innovative lithium-ion batteries, Airbus reverted to proven nickel cadmium to avoid certification difficulties.

Countdown to takeoff

The biggest lessons we can draw from the past is that we need to move from one step to the other on these big programs, without rushing, Airbus chief executive officer Fabrice Bregier said at last summer’s Farnborough show.

Since then, progress has been sufficiently brisk for A350 engineers to view mid-June as a target for its first flight, even if the official goal remains a less specific mid-2013, according to Bregier.

Gilles Fournier, managing director for the Paris air show, told journalists last month he expects the A350 to fly by the start of the event, though there are no firm plans for a visit.

Airbus first moved the A350 out of its hangar in February for radio and pressurization tests, and procedures to check fuel tank tightness as well as fuel transfer.

In March, the plane was fitted with its two Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines and an auxiliary power unit and underwent analysis of instruments to check that the resonance frequencies of the structure remained within the allowed margin for flight tests.

BA defection

The A350’s program head, Didier Evrard, is leading efforts to get the plane airborne, arriving at the factory before 7 am and leaving after 8 pm.

Having been painted, the A350 will shortly be turned over to pilots and flight-test engineers, who will monitor it from the first flight through more than 12 months of rigorous trials culminating in certification and service entry.

Tests to be done before the aircraft gets airborne include running engines through controlled cycles, taxiing at low and high speeds, and a a so-called rejected takeoff at high velocity to check that brakes, spoilers and thrust reversers all work properly to bring the aircraft to a controlled standstill.

An A350 flight by mid-June could have a snowball effect for Airbus, building sales momentum for the A350-1000 variant due to begin deliveries in 2017, even as Boeing seeks to drum up orders for the competing 777X, according to Teal Group’s Aboulafia.

Possible pitfalls

The US company’s ongoing issues with the 787 mean it has only just begun marketing the re-winged and re-engined 777, and hasn’t yet committed to going ahead with a plane that wouldn’t enter service before the end of the decade. Already last month, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, a major 777 customer, signed a contract for 18 A350-1000s.

Still, the remaining A350 testing schedule may not be plain sailing, with scope remaining for hitches with the plane’s electronic systems during final trials, according to Tecop International President Hans Weber, a physicist and aerospace expert who advises the US Federal Aviation Administration.

Software glitches are one of the biggest worries in these systems, Weber said in an interview. Everything on the plane is ultimately controlled by software, and it can be a lengthy effort to find a glitch and fix it.

Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners in London who has followed the aviation industry for 30 years, said Airbus has played it straight with the A350 program in not announcing milestones before they’re genuinely achievable.

Having the A350 fly by the Paris air show would be great from a prestige point of view, he said. But they’ll only do it if they’re really comfortable. They’re not going to be pushed. BLOOMBERG

Air India flight travelling from Bangkok to New Delhi when drama unfolded

Pilot allegedly instructed flight attendants how to fly before resting up in business class with co-pilot



Had to rush back when one of the hostesses accidentally turned off auto-pilot setting



Four crew members suspended as aviation authority launches probe

Two pilots have been suspended from an airline after they allegedly left an Airbus carrying 166 passengers on autopilot and air hostesses in charge while they slept in business class.

The Air India flight was travelling from Bangkok to New Delhi when both the co-pilot and the pilot left the cockpit after having spent some time instructing two flight attendants how to fly.



But the pair had to rush back and seize the controls of the A-320 after one of them accidentally turned off the autopilot setting, sources said.

An Air India official admits the cockpit was in control of the air hostess for 20 minutes

On Friday, the national carrier suspended a pilot, the captain of the April 12 Airbus A-320 Bangkok- New Delhi flight, his co-pilot, and two flight attendants who had accidentally switched off the autopilot in the cockpit momentarily.

According to sources, pilot B.K. Soni and co-pilot Ravindra Nath napped in business class, leaving flight attendants Kanika Kala and J. Bhatt in charge of the plane.



A senior member of the cabin crew witnessed the entire drama and brought the matter to the notice of the airline's management. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has started a probe into the incident.

An Air India official admits the cockpit was in air hostess control for 20 minutes, sources say 40, but Director General of Civil Aviation Arun Mishra has said that the air hostesses stayed in the cockpit for the 'larger part of the three-hour flight'.



Air hostesses are allowed in the cockpit, but only for the amount of time it takes to serve a cup of tea or a snack.



'It is a serious matter. We are investigating the case,' Mr Mishra said.

The flight took off from Bangkok at 8.55 am. Half-an-hour and 33,000 feet into the flight, First Officer Ravindra Nath excused himself from the cockpit to visit the washroom. He asked flight attendant J. Bhatt to occupy the co-pilot's seat in his absence.

Minutes after Nath exited, Captain B.K. Soni called Kanika Kala and asked her to take his seat. Soni did not leave the cockpit immediately, however.



According to a source, he spent some time teaching the two airhostesses how to operate the aircraft before joining Nath in business class.



After the flying lesson, Soni put the plane on auto-pilot, leaving the stewardesses by themselves in the cockpit for around 40 minutes.



Auto-pilot does not mean pilots can leave the cockpit. They have to be present to monitor the flight path and can turn off auto-pilot mode if required.



A statement issued by Air India on Friday stressed that 'at no point of time was the cockpit left unattended by the cockpit crew'.



It then went to say: 'During the incident, due to distraction the co-pilot had touched the auto pilot disconnect button momentarily. But the same was connected back.'



Captain Mohan Ranganathan, a member of Civil Aviation Safety Advisory Council, a government-appointed aviation safety panel, blamed the 'lackadaisical attitude' of the DGCA for the increase in air safety violations.



'The DGCA should be held responsible for the increase in such cases as they have failed time and again to effectively enforce safety guidelines,' said Ranganathan.

Adding the A380 to one of Emirates’ two daily Brisbane services will see an increase in capacity of 135 seats for sale per flight and 1,890 week, reinforcing Emirates’ commitment to its Queensland and Auckland passengers.

The double-daily service is currently operated by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

“On the back of growing passenger demand on the route as well as demand for our flagship aircraft, we will become the first airline to bring the state-of-the-art A380 to Brisbane, offering Queenslanders the chance to experience this revolutionary aircraft and the best service in the sky first-hand,” said Salem Obaidalla, Emirates’ senior vice president commercial operations, Far East and Australasia.

“Emirates currently operates its A380s from Auckland to Melbourne and Sydney and on to Dubai and Emirates’ ever expanding global network. The third A380 will give our New Zealand customers more flexibility on their routes to Australia and onwards,” said Obaidalla.

“The Dubai-Brisbane-Auckland route is a popular choice among business and leisure travelers alike and the new Emirates A380 service will be instrumental in helping Emirates meet its passenger demand as well as deliver considerable economic benefits through inbound seats and travel connections,” he said.

“Australia represents an important market for Emirates and ranks in the top three countries on Emirates’ global network,” Obaidalla said.

Together with Qantas, from October a total of six daily A380 services will operate to Dubai, offering a seamless A380 experience through Dubai International Airport’s Concourse A, the world’s first purpose built A380 concourse, to 21 A380 serviced destinations on the network including London Heathrow, Manchester, Paris and Rome.

The latest announcement caps off a range of recent upgrades to Emirates’ Australian services, including the introduction of a daily Melbourne A380, a daily Adelaide service and a three times daily Perth service. A second A380 for Sydney from June has been announced.

“This is also a significant announcement for New Zealand where we are continuing our growth, from 2 October Auckland will be welcoming its third daily Emirates A380,” added Obaidalla.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9986226558685303}",positive,0.9986226558685303,1
BA plane's emergency landing at Heathrow caused by maintenance error - The Guardian,"Fri, 31 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEzL21heS8zMS9iYS1wbGFuZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1lcnJvctIBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEzL21heS8zMS9iYS1wbGFuZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1lcnJvcg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A maintenance error led to engine parts being blown off a British Airways plane that was forced to make an emergency landing at Heathrow last week, investigators have confirmed.

Pictures showed that the cowls covering the aircraft engines were not properly shut, leading the 40kg metal coverings to fly loose during takeoff.

In a special bulletin on Friday, the Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) confirmed details of the damage the Airbus A319 sustained in the incident, in which the plane trailed smoke as it was forced to land on one engine over a heavily populated area of west London.

At least one of the cowls struck the plane, causing damage to the fuselage, wing, landing gear and a fuel pipe. Both of the engines were exposed, and the right-hand one caught fire and was shut down by pilots.

Investigators called on Airbus to again tell operators to ensure essential checks are made on the cowl closures, a known safety risk. Airbus had noted 32 similar incidents on its A320 family of planes, including the A319, in which the engine cowls detached in flight, causing damage to the plane. The manufacturer issued a safety briefing last year urging crews to be aware of the risks.

The AAIB said that cowls had not to date caused an engine fire, and the exact cause of the blaze was still under investigation.

The report made clear that previous information from the US government that the left-hand, American-made International Aero Engines V2500 engine was closed down was incorrect, confirming it continued to function.

The London-to-Oslo flight BA762 turned back to Heathrow soon after takeoff on 24 May. Passengers and witnesses saw smoke and flames emanating from the plane. The 75 passengers and crew were evacuated via emergency slides on landing.

Both runways at Heathrow were closed briefly, and British Airways cancelled all short-haul flights until 4pm the same day.

The British Airways chief executive, Keith Williams, said: ""We welcome the publication of the AAIB interim report. We continue to co-operate fully with the investigation team and can confirm that appropriate initial action has already been taken in accordance with the AAIB's safety recommendation to Airbus.

""We regret we are precluded from releasing or discussing any additional details while the AAIB investigation is ongoing.

""We commend the professionalism of the flight crew for the safe landing of the plane and the cabin crew and pilots for its safe evacuation. We continue to offer our full support to those customers who were onboard the flight.""

An Airbus spokesman said: ""We're supporting the AAIB-led investigation and will be following its recommendations.""

Passengers expressed incredulity that the emergency was caused by a known risk. Alexandra Townsley, 27, a solicitor from west London, who was sitting in seat 5F beside the right-hand engine, said: ""I think people who were on board are going to be very angry. It's one thing to think that things go wrong, but this seems to be something standard that wasn't checked – what procedures are in place? If it's something that can be missed that easily and is missed repeatedly, I don't see why Airbus can't find a way to fix it so it can't happen again.""

She added: ""It sounds like this was a lucky miss.""

She said of the flight: ""It was absolutely terrifying. We knew something was wrong right on takeoff as we saw the cowl door ripped off, just as the wheels came off the ground. I find it strange that the report says that crew weren't initially aware that anything was wrong. We were all shouting.""

Jean Ralphs, a passenger who was sitting in seat 3F on the flight, said: ""I will not fly on the first flight of a day on any Airbus plane until this is sorted out. I don't think the answer is adequate.""

David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight Global, said: ""It would have been difficult to fly with the damage to the wings and exterior – but well within the capability of a highly trained crew.""

The AAIB's full report will follow, probably in several months.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8981033563613892}",negative,0.8981033563613892,-1

But for its newest jet, the A350, Airbus is not planning much fanfare. Credit: Reuters

Eight years after European leaders witnessed a spectacle worthy of stadium opera to launch the A380 superjumbo, Europe's latest aeronautical venture will prepare to leave the nest with less fanfare in an industry sobered by delays and technical mishaps.

Airbus has started painting the A350, a sign it is approaching a maiden flight, but has bowed to the industry's increasingly pragmatic mood by deciding against a traditional ""rollout"" for its newest jet.

The first coat of paint in Airbus livery should be ready on the A350 next week, people familiar with the project say.

After that, the high-tech carbon-composite jet will be all dressed up with nowhere to go until the first flight, which most industry sources expect in late June or early July.

The lack of pomp reflects growing emphasis on project ""execution"" after Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers endured multiple delays and problems culminating in the three-month grounding of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner earlier this year.

Asked recently whether Airbus would hold an A350 rollout ceremony, Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said, ""Probably not. We'll go straight to our first flight.""

The flight's timing may disappoint enthusiasts hoping to see the jet, developed at an estimated $15 billion, at the Paris air show on June 17-23.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9475911855697632}",negative,0.9475911855697632,-1
Foreign airlines may soon get nod to fly Airbus A380 into India | Mint - Mint,"Thu, 09 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Qb2xpdGljcy83YUpGQkNkeGI4Z2h4aU5KSHRrZjdIL0ZvcmVpZ24tYWlybGluZXMtbWF5LWJlLWFsbG93ZWQtdG8tZmx5LUFpcmJ1cy1BMzgwLWluLUluZGlhLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL1BvbGl0aWNzLzdhSkZCQ2R4YjhnaHhpTkpIdGtmN0gvRm9yZWlnbi1haXJsaW5lcy1tYXktYmUtYWxsb3dlZC10by1mbHktQWlyYnVzLUEzODAtaW4tSW5kaWEuaHRtbD9mYWNldD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nine airlines, including Etihad Airways PJSC, Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, operate the wide-body, double-deck jets, which can seat as many as 525 passengers.

“They are all asking for it,"" said civil aviation minister Ajit Singh, referring to a slew of foreign airlines wanting to fly the jumbo jet into India’s modernized airports such as Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. Singh said he sees no reason why the A380 should not be allowed to fly in India.

With India allowing foreign direct investments in airline and Etihad buying a 24% stake in Jet Airways (India) Ltd, the government is likely to favour greater access to newer aircraft, said analysts.

So far, the Airbus A380 has been barred from flying commercially in India because it may stretch the existing infrastructure at Indian airports and undermine local airlines that do not have the aircraft in their fleet.

Still, the Airbus A380 has made debut flights in India, been present at local air shows and even made an emergency landing at Hyderabad on its way from Australia.

“The only thing left is how to allow it so that it is not inconvenient to other passengers. Right now, 500 passengers disembark in one go so there are concerns on security, immigration and also on ground handling of the A380,"" Singh said, adding that a committee will do a time study at airports to ascertain how the aircraft can be allowed without stretching the infrastructure. “We have to see which time slots it can be allowed in,"" Singh said, without specifying when the study will be completed.

Once the study is cleared, the ministry will have to amend bilateral agreements with various countries that want to fly such aircraft into India.

Since the Airbus A380 is a new aircraft, introduced only in the last decade, most bilateral agreements with other countries still specify the aircraft type as Boeing 747 (the largest jet flying then) or equivalent.

India this year conducted fresh bilateral negotiations with Singapore, Oman and Abu Dhabi but refrained from adding the word Airbus A380 in those agreements.

Airbus A380 currently plies on business routes such as London-Heathrow; Paris-Charles de Gaulle; Hong Kong; Frankfurt; Dubai; Singapore and Tokyo and other cities.

A potential clearance for A380 could also clash with Air India Ltd’s international plans with its new Boeing Dreamliner 787s.

The airline’s chairman Rohit Nandan said in April Air India would fly to new cities, including Rome, Milan, Birmingham, Melbourne and Sydney, in the next five months using the 787s, a first in over a decade.

“When a fourfold increase in capacity has been signed off (to Abu Dhabi) stating that passengers will benefit, they might as well give the benefit of the latest aircraft to the passengers,"" said Mohan Ranganathan, a Chennai-based aviation safety consultant. “However, is our infrastructure ready in case of a diversion of an A380 to another airport? That will be the biggest hurdle.""

India should open A380 to one and all, said Shakti Lumba, formerly vice-president with Air India and IndiGo.

“I have never understood why any aircraft is kept out. The last one was the Concorde. Restrictions killed an excellent airplane,"" he said.

Lumba said such restrictions are protectionist. “Someone was being protected who does not need protection any more. Government should open up and provide a level field to stimulate growth.""

Ferrero Travel Market will be showing off its new Airbus Kinder Surprise 5-pack as part of the Kinder Collection at next week’s TFWA Asia Pacific show.

The company says that its Airbus Kinder Surprise gift pack contains five egg-shaped Kinder Surprises and a model of the Airbus A330-300 plane inside, sporting Asiana, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines or Kinder livery.

The see-through gift box is said to make an ‘attractive display case’ for the model aircraft and the company says these Airbus Kinder Surprise packs have been landing at leading airports in Europe since February, including London, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid, and they have just received their flight plans to launch in Asia.

Alberto Donnini, Marketing Manager said: “The Airbus themed Kinder Surprise SKU has a very strong link with the airport channel. It is proving an excellent product, popular with children and collectors alike, because it offers the full collection of five airplanes in each box, all encased in the much loved Kinder chocolate.”

FAMILY THEMES

Also in the new Kinder Collection is a range of family-orientated products, which have been given a crazy Looney Tunes theme. The Kinder Choco Box, decorated with Looney Tunes characters, holds four Kinder Chocolate bars and four Kinder Country bars, and once empty doubles up as a money box.

The best selling item in the Kinder travel range, the Kinder Chocolate 32-bar pack, also has a Looney Tunes soccer game on the pack to cut out and play. The Kinder Surprise 4-pack has one of the eight Looney Tunes Show characters inside each pack.

However, travellers to the Middle East could just get lucky next month, courtesy a shisha lounge facility on board select Airbus A380 aircrafts in the Emirates fleet.

A trial run that may become a permanent fixture by year end, this service allows you to order your choice of hookah from a menu, and proceed to the lounge after the main meal.

The new seat sports a modern design which folds down into a 1.98m (6'6"") long horizontal lie-flat bed.

Other creature comforts include more storage nooks for stowing your inflight kit, while the 15' video screens will seem like IMAX in the sky compared to the A380's current 10.4' displays.

However, while the business class configuration in Lufthansa's 747-8s sees each pair of seats angled towards each other in a V-shape (as shown below), Lufthansa's A380 layout is expected to have both seats parallel but pointing towards the outer cabin wall.

Either way, passengers in the window seat will need to carefully maneuver themselves over the legs of a sleeping aisle-seated neighbour.

This real-world photo from our Lufthansa 747-8 jaunt illustrates just how tight things can get.

Such Cirque du Soleil-inspired clambering is a big minus compared with the business classes with direct aisle access which all business class passengers enjoy on many other airlines.

Lufthansa's A380 business class configuration will be a 2-2-2 layout, similar to the main deck of its Boeing 747-8.

The seats in the centre pair of the 747-8 boast an extra-wide centre console with plenty of elbow room to go around.

Contrast that with the narrower console in the pairs of seats by the windows.

Lufthansa's A380 refit is slated to begin in November, with the superjumbos being temporarily replaced by Boeing 747s on key international routes such as Frankfurt-Beijing and Frankfurt-Tokyo.

South African officials suspended after Gupta wedding airbus lands 'without authority'

Billionaire brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta have landed in controversy over the landing of a chartered plane hired by them at the restricted Waterkloof Air Base in Pretoria, South Africa.



Five South African officials, including police and military commanders, were suspended after the airbus carrying about 200 guests from India to a family wedding was allowed to land, the government said.

The guests attended the wedding of Vega Gupta, whose family has powerful business interests in South Africa, and groom Aakash Jahajgarhia in an extravaganza spanning several days at Sun City, a leisure center northwest of Johannesburg.

The wedding took place in the famous resort of Sun City

Some South African current and former officials also attended.

But thousands of miles away from the high-profile Gupta wedding party in South Africa, Saharanpur, an otherwise sleepy town in west Uttar Pradesh, is busy preparing for the grandest wedding reception ever in the area.



This ancestral town of the Gupta family cannot stop discussing the mega event, an 'after party' for the local people, on May 12.

The event is being organised by the Gupta brothers to celebrate the marriage of their niece Vega, the daughter of Anil Gupta and Achla. Anil, the brother-in-law of the Guptas, is settled with his family in an upscale area in Saharanpur.

Vikas Sharma, the contractor for Silver Castle, the venue for the reception, can't recall a bigger event in the town. ""We have been given an estimate of around 5,000 people besides around 1,000 support staff of caterers and decorators for the event. We have earlier hosted big events on our two-lawn venue, but the number of VVIPs expected to come to the May 12 party is more than any,"" Sharma told Mail Today.



The Gupta family and wedding guests check in at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg for their flight back to India on May 3

He claimed Punjabi singer Daler Mehndi has been contacted to entertain the guests. ""There are some other names too but we are not sure about them,"" he added. Sharma has no information about the caterers and decorators for the event.

""They are coming from outside, most probably Delhi,"" he said. ""They will take over the preparations of the party from May 9 onwards. The entire property, including both the lawns, 7,200 sqft banquet and the 20 rooms, will be used for the function,"" Sharma said.



Another manager at Silver Castle said ever since the Guptas chose this venue on the outskirts of Saharanpur, the organisers have been receiving ""courtesy calls"" from several VIPs in the state to ensure that the preparations are going on smoothly.



He hinted that the guest list includes chief minister Akhilesh Yadav as well, but it could not be confirmed.



Such is the buzz over the wedding reception that the town is literally divided in two sections - those who have the wedding invitation and those who don't.

Vega Gupta (23), the Gupta brothers' niece, and Aakash Jahajgarhia during the wedding

In fact, the first thing that any invitee talks about is the ""very expensive"" invitation card, estimated to be priced around Rs 1,500. Ainan Masood Ansari, a mess manager at IIT Roorke's Saharanpur campus, gave a running commentary on the special features of invitation card.



He showed how the name of each invitee was printed on the card and even its paper cover had a unique tag with the name of the invitee on it.



Serving the special sweets he received with the card, Ansari said: ""We've kept it for special guests.""



Praising the humility of the Guptas and their attachment with Saharanpur, Ansari said: ""The best thing about them (Guptas) is that they haven't forgotten the people they stayed with in the past. No matter how big or how small their friends are, they have been in touch with all of them.""

The invitation card is a prized possession for all the guests but it has left them in the same dilemma - What does one gift to the Gupta family on the reception?



""Any self-respecting middle class family cannot go to a wedding without a present. We generally gift cash to the hosts. But what does one give to such a millionaire family whose invitation card alone is said to be between Rs 1500 and Rs 2000,"" said one of the invitees.



Ansari said he is still thinking about the gift.



""If nothing else, I will take cash in an envelope but I don't know how they will react,"" he said.



Vipin Sharma, who too has been invited to the May 12 party, said unlike other millionaires from the area, the Guptas have maintained their ""local connection"".

""Every time they come here they meet the local people and keep themselves connected with the area through various philanthropic and social activities,"" Sharma, who runs a local cable network, said.

Of the three brothers, Ajay Gupta is the most well known and respected in Saharanpur, said Vipin. ""His attitude hasn't changed even after this meteoric rise.""



Both Ansari and Sharma spoke about the same projects planned by the Gupta family in Saharanpur.



They plan to set up a mini-replica of Delhi's Akshardham temple at Lal Dass Ka Bada on the banks of Pao Dhoi river, where their late father spent a lot of time.



A relative shows the invitation card for the reception

""They get so much respect because of such active involvement and plans for the community. In the past, when the South African cricket team came to India, the Guptas brought many players to Saharanpur for a roadshow,"" Ansari said.



Anil Bhardwaj, a journalist who too has been invited to the reception, immediately recollected that mega event. ""The Gupta family got the South Africa cricketers to Saharanpur and made them go around the town on an open horse cart. I went and met them at their residence on Mission Compound Road where the cricketers halted before the roadshow.""



Some locals said the Guptas have planned a separate party for the workers of their factory.



The Gupta's residence in Saharanpur is being looked after by a caretaker.



Anil Gupta's family, which has been settled in Saharanpur for long, is one of the main reasons for the Guptas to visit the town. But now that their daughter is married, many in the town feel even Anil Gupta and his wife will move to their Dehradun house or perhaps to South Africa.



""They have such a nice bungalow in Uttarakhand and a huge political clout as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they shift to Dehradun,"" said another family friend.

China Southern's Sydney-Guangzhou Airbus A380 flights now on sale - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 28 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vY2hpbmEtc291dGhlcm4tcy1zeWRuZXktZ3Vhbmd6aG91LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWZsaWdodHMtbm93LW9uLXNhbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China Southern's new Airbus A380 service between Sydney and Guangzhou is now open for bookings, with the airline offering special promotional prices across all three travel classes for flights from the October 28 inaugural date.

Return business class fares start at $2,380, with first class from $3,800 and economy from $720, all including taxes.

Best of all, those fares apply for all of China Southern's Australian services to its Guangzhou hub: so travellers in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are up for the same super-competitive deals, with extensions through to Beijing and Shanghai.

Business class and first class fares are on sale now until June 12, 2013, and are valid for travel from October 28, 2013 to January 31, 2014; economy fares are on sale through to June 4, 2013, covering travel from October 28 to December 7, 2013.

""These A380 welcome fares are the best we have ever offered to China because we want to celebrate the introduction of the superjumbo when it starts into Sydney"" said China Southern Regional General Manager Australia/New Zealand Henry He.

Mr He notes that when the A380 service starts on October 28, all of China Southern’s Australian ports will be serviced by the airline's latest Airbus aircraft – the A380 Superjumbo in Sydney and brand new A330-200/300 airliners to other ports, ""all offering fully flat seats in Business and personal televisions throughout.""

“Our fleet is ultra-modern and our fares are ultra-competitive, and I invite all Australians to check out our Canton Route fares to the rest of the world as well as to China.”

For more information contact your travel agent, call 1300 889 628 during business hours or visit facebook.com/ChinaSouthernAU.

Guangzhou to London

China Southern's superjumbo will slot into the daily CZ325/326 service, which departs Sydney at 9.50am to reach Guangzhou at 5.30pm.

Travellers continuing to London on China Southern's 'Canton Route' will have the option of breaking their journey at Guangzhou for up to 72 hours without a visa, under new transit permit rules to be introduced later this year.

However, China Southern doesn't offer an A380 service between Guangzhou and London due to the airline having only five A380s in its fleet.

China Southern currently runs only one international A380 service, that being between Guangzhou and Los Angeles.

The airline's other A380 routes are all within China, including the world's shortest A380 trip of just over two hours between Guangzhou and Shanghai.

Inside China Southern's Airbus A380

CZ's A380 represents a substantial upgrade from the Airbus A330s currently used between Sydney and Guangzhou with improvements from tip to tail.

At the front of the main deck you'll find the first class Platinum Private Suites. These SQ-style suites are ensconced by shoulder-height walls and refreshingly bling-free, outfitted in a calm and elegant royal purple.

The eight suites on board are laid out across two rows, in a 1-2-1 configuration, with the slide-down divider between the middle pairs allowing for a chat with your travelling companion or colleague en route.

The seat controls and extra-large table are found in the handy armrest, which is itself a pleasing size for marshalling all your first class gear.

Most of the upper deck is given over to the airline's confusingly-named business class offering, which China Southern dubs as 'First Class' – good luck trying to swing that one past your company's travel manager when it comes to booking a business trip!

Frequent flyers may be familiar with these types of seats – they're made by EADS Sogerma and adopt a staggered layout with direct aisle access for every passenger.

Simple and clean lines are the order of the day once more for China Southern, with a calm and rather corporate light blue seat and off-white plastic surrounding shell.

The centre pairs (E and F seats on China Southern) are the seats to pick if you're travelling with your other half, and the seats to skip if you're not.

We'd also suggest avoiding the aisle seats on the side and in the middle (C and H on the CZ seatmap) skip since your elbows will be right out in the aisles, ready to be banged by the first trolley or passenger that goes past.

That all makes the A and K window seats, which have a large armrest/cocktail table between you and the rest of the plane, plus a few inches extra bed length, the ones to snag.

And, of course, you get the elbow room on the other side from the window storage bins – all up, the extra surface area makes for a very practical 'office in the sky'.

Looking more closely at the seat, you'll find the controls sensibly up where the contents of your pockets won't brush up against them.

A water bottle holder sits in the corner, with a full universal power point at a handy spot right next to your arm.

We like the clever recessed cupholder/plateholder too: no glasses sliding around here.

Economy class (refreshingly named 'Economy Class') is towards the back of the main cabin in the usual 3-4-3 seat layout.

If you're flying to China in the cheap sets we suggest booking into in the smaller upstairs economy cabin: this sports a roomier 2-4-2 layout with extra elbow and surface space plus more personal storage area for passengers in window seats.

(The seats you want are rows 70 through 78 - avoid row 79, which is a middle block of four seats flanked by the toilets, galley and crew area.)

Air Namibia passengers happy with Airbus A319-100 regional aircraft - Namibia Economist,"Fri, 17 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9taXN0LmNvbS5uYS80ODUzL3NwZWNpYWwtZm9jdXMvYWlyLW5hbWliaWEtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1oYXBweS13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5LTEwMC1yZWdpb25hbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The decision by Air Namibia to buy two new Airbus A319-100 aircraft is beginning to reap dividends for the airline in some of its regional routes as the national carrier is seeing a steady increase in customer satisfaction levels as well as passenger numbers.

Air Namibia now operates four Airbus A319-100 planes on its regional routes, covering flights between Windhoek, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Luanda and Accra. Passengers who have had the opportunity to fly on the Air Namibia Airbus A319-100 fleet, two of which were received from the Airbus Hamburg Assembly plant during January and March 2013, have expressed their satisfaction with the aircraft use.

Passengers are particularly happy with the much improved level of reliability as these aircraft are new and technically fit to operate with minimal break-downs. The inside of the planes is clean and very neat, legroom is adequate in both business and economy class, and the flight stewardess are professional and friendly.

This reporter recently flew on the Windhoek to Cape Town flight. The plane was full in both business class and economy class, a sign that the national airline is now acceptable to the public unlike in the past when it operated old planes which were continuously having technical problems. An official with the airline manning the Cape Town offices said they have seen a steady increase in passenger numbers in recent months on the Cape Town to Windhoek route where the airline operates two flights daily; one in the morning and one in the evening. The official said, the airline is particularly busy during weekends, where they are always fully booked. She advised passengers to book well in advance of their travel dates to avoid disappointment of the flight being full, forcing them to travel on alternate days.

Passengers interviewed by the Economist said they were happy with the new aircraft as it has less turbulence and is more comfortable. They were also happy with the reduced noise levels while on-board.

Windhoek resident, Robyn Damaschke said she was impressed with the improvements. She said: “Air Namibia is a huge improvement on what it used to be; food, services, everything, much better.”

Young entrepreneur, Frans Bwalya, a frequent flyer with Air Namibia who was travelling from Cape Town on a business trip said the new Airbus A319-100 has brought peace of mind whenever he travels. Bwalya said: It’s [Air Namibia’s A319-100 aircraft] a beautiful thing. Comfortable, no turbulence, no noise, no funny stuff. I think it’s money well spent on this aircraft; it is worth it. For us frequent flyers, at least you get that sense of comfort and security. Previously, we would always be scared of turbulence. I think this aircraft is ok.”

Another passenger, Alessia Araujo said the A319-100 was less bumpy, much smoother and more comfortable. “I think it’s much better; I am pretty chilled,” she said. Powered by CFM International’s CFM56-5B6/3 engines, the new A319-100 aircraft were bought to replace the ageing Boeing B737 fleet and complement two other Airbus A319-100 aircraft already in use since October 2011 through a lease agreement from a financial institution based in Germany. They have a total seat capacity of 112 seats: 16 Business Class and 96 Economy Class. Seating arrangement in business class is a classic two by two format, with no middle seats, affording business class passengers sufficient comfort, and good value for money. In economy class, seating follows a classic narrow-body three by three configuration.

Officials from Air Namibia are on record saying they settled for the Airbus A319-100 from the various options they had to select from because the aircraft was found to be best-suited for our environment and market situation, primarily looking at correct cabin size, given the demand on the various routes where it will be deployed, cost effectiveness, commonality with the Airbus A340-300 used on the long haul flight to Frankfurt, dispatch reliability record, as well as new generation design and technology.

With this level of improvement, which the national airline has committed to maintain consistently, it will be no surprise if Air Namibia wins again the “Best Regional Airline” Award for excellence in customer service standards as the airline is returning to its former glory days of excellent customer service delivery.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9897996187210083}",positive,0.9897996187210083,1

By fijivillage.com Sunday 12/05/2013 fijivillage.com

The aircraft will arrive next week Thursday at the Nadi International Airport.

NATIONAL carrier, Air Zimbabwe, has taken delivery of an Airbus A320 which is expected to ply the Johannesburg route.

Report by Staff Reporter/Agencies

The plane, which was going under routine maintenance and safety checks yesterday at the Harare International Airport, had already had the airline’s livery.

The Airbus will add to Air Zimbabwe’s current fleet comprising two B767-200s, three B737-200s and three MA60s.

Shingai Taruvinga, the airline’s spokesperson, yesterday said another Airbus would be delivered soon.

“This plane will be plying our Johannesburg route,” she said.

“We should have another Airbus delivered soon.”

Early this year, AirZim resumed daily flights to Victoria Falls, Bulawayo and Johannesburg.

The airline’s board chairperson Ozias Bvute told Parliament in March that AirZim will resume international flights to London in July this year after beefing up its fleet as part of its turnaround strategy.

“We have looked at route viability and we have identified the short-term routes that we think we want to concentrate on and ensure that those routes are managed and serviced properly for the benefit of our travelling partners,” Bvute said then.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9959619641304016}",neutral,0.9959619641304016,0

AIRBUS UK Broughton have made former Northern Ireland international striker Steve Jones their first summer signing.

The 36-year-old has spent most of his career playing professional for clubs including Crewe Alexandra, Burnley, Walsall and Motherwell.

But Derry-born Jones, who won 29 caps for his country, has spent the past two years at AFC Telford United in the Conference.

Airbus director of football Andy Preece said: “Our aim is to bring players with extra quality to add to the current squad that fit into our current wage structure and are hungry to be successful.

“Steve ticks all the boxes. He was top scorer at a Conference club last season and is a really exciting signing for us.”

The arrival of the vastly experienced Jones rounds off a week to remember for the European-bound Wingmakers.

Preece has been named as one of two contenders for the Corbett Sports Welsh Premier League manager of the year after leading the club into the Europa League. The other is Carl Darlington, the boss of champions The New Saints.

Two members of Preece’s squad from last season are also in line for honours.

Lee Owens is one of three players in the running for the league’s player of the year award. The right-back is up against Prestatyn Town’s Andy Parkinson and The New Saints’ Michael Wilde.

On-loan defender Steve Tomassen – who has since returned to Wrexham – will battle it out with The New Saints duo Kai Edwards and Ryan Fraughan for the young player of the year.

Owens, centre-back Ian Kearney and winger Wayne Riley have been selected in the league’s team of the year while Glenn Rule’s stunning volley in January’s 6-1 success at Prestatyn Town has been named goal of the season.

Midfielder Jason Jarrett has signed for Chester FC.

Key duo Jamie Petrie and Rob Jones are believed to be signing for Bangor City after turning down the offer of new contracts to remain at Gap Connah’s Quay.

Nomads player-manager Mark McGregor said: “I have personally thanked both of the players for their services to the club as they were a large part of how far we have come on over the past three successful years.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998569488525391}",neutral,0.9998569488525391,0
