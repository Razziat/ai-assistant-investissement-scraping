Sustainable Aviation Fuel | Decarbonisation - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvcmVzcGVjdGluZy10aGUtcGxhbmV0L2RlY2FyYm9uaXNhdGlvbi9zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For almost a century, aircraft have been fueled by kerosene. Now, a new generation of sustainable aviation fuels has the potential to halve the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by 2050.

What is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is certified jet fuel (Jet-A/A1). However, unlike traditional jet fuel fully derived from fossil resources, today's SAF is a blend of conventional fossil fuel and synthetic components made from a range of renewable “feedstock” (such as used cooking oils, fats, plant oils, municipal, agricultural and forestry waste). All Airbus aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and conventional fuel. However, by 2030, all our aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. ASTM International, a global standards and testing body, has approved eight technical pathways for producing SAF. Each pathway has its own set of requirements based on different feedstocks and conversion processes. Here are just three of the most common pathways: HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): The HEFA process refines vegetable oils, waste oils, or fats into SAF through hydrotreating and hydroprocessing.

(Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): The HEFA process refines vegetable oils, waste oils, or fats into SAF through hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. Alcohol to Jet : Alcohol to Jet (AtJ) converts alcohols such as ethanol and iso-butanol into SAF by removing the oxygen and linking the molecules together.

: Alcohol to Jet (AtJ) converts alcohols such as ethanol and iso-butanol into SAF by removing the oxygen and linking the molecules together. eFuels: SAF can be produced using green hydrogen, capturing carbon dioxide, and using renewable electricity to create synthetic fuels. This type of SAF is sometimes referred to as eFuel or Power-to-Liquid (PtL).

How does SAF reduce the aviation industry's carbon footprint? Air transport represents approximately 2-3% of global human-induced GHG emissions. SAF is one of the means the aviation industry is using to reduce that carbon footprint. On average, SAF can reduce CO 2 emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation. The key to SAF's impact lies in its life cycle. When burned, SAF still produces emissions similar to those emitted by fossil fuels. But unlike conventional jet fuels, which take fossil resources out of the ground and release previously stored carbon into the atmosphere, SAF primarily uses carbon that is part of the current carbon cycle in various feedstocks. This means that the CO 2 emitted during an aircraft's flight is re-absorbed by the biomass used in SAF production.

What challenges are delaying SAF uptake? The SAF ecosystem is in its infancy. In 2023, SAF volumes reached over 600 million litres (0.5Mt), double the 300 million litres (0.25 Mt) produced in 2022 but still only amounting to 0.2% of all aviation fuel for the year. Limited volumes mean SAF is much more expensive than conventional jet fuel. As production expands SAF will likely be able to compete on price, but this is not a given; it requires collaboration between governments, industry and regulators on a global scale. Appropriate regulatory mechanisms and inventive structures still need to be put in place, and even then, there are challenges associated with the limited availability of land and biowaste. As the SAF ecosystem matures, it is expected that multiple pathways utilising the most regionally appropriate feedstocks will be established. It is clear that both biomass sources and eFuels will be necessary to meet demand.

What is Airbus doing to increase SAF usage? Airbus is increasing the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of 15% SAF in our global fuel mix by the end of 2024 and at least 30% by 2030. We have been accompanying our customers in their own reduced emissions journey, giving them the option to fuel their new aircraft with SAF since 2016. Airbus is conducting flight tests with 100% SAF, exploring the impact of SAF emissions (both contrails and non-CO 2 ) on the atmosphere. The Airbus employee travel policy offers SAF to airlines for all employee business travel and we fuel our shuttle flights with SAF when the aircraft is fuelled on Airbus premises and where SAF is available. Airbus supports the large-scale development of SAF and has been actively engaged in certification processes and demonstration projects. We collaborate with airlines, airports, SAF producers and research institutions around the world to help advance the SAF ecosystem, addressing the policy and regulatory environment and the drivers of supply and demand.

Airbus Pulls Further Ahead of Boeing in Global Plane Rivalry - The New York Times,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZWFybmluZ3MuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus said Thursday that it would ramp up deliveries this year of some of the world’s most sought-after aircraft, bolstering its position as the largest plane maker and pulling further ahead of Boeing as its U.S. rival focuses on the fallout from a major safety crisis involving its 737 Max line of airliners.

Airbus, the European aerospace giant, plans to deliver around 800 jets to customers this year, including the popular single-aisle A320neo, its main competitor to the 737 Max. It delivered 735 planes last year, more than it had originally targeted. This year’s push is intended to meet what Guillaume Faury, the plane maker’s chief executive, said was a sharp recovery in demand for air travel after pandemic lockdowns.

Airbus pulled in a record 2,094 commercial aircraft orders last year, partly on a surge in demand for narrow-body and midsize jets from India and other rapidly growing countries. That added to the company’s extensive backlog of 8,598 commercial aircraft at the end of 2023.

By contrast, Boeing delivered 528 commercial airplanes and recorded 1,576 net orders.

Airbus has also started work on preparing a successor for the best-selling A320neo, Mr. Faury announced. The new plane would be more fuel-efficientand would take to the skies by the mid- to late 2030s.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1

Airbus takes charges on satellite programs - SpaceNews,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdGFrZXMtY2hhcmdlcy1vbi1zYXRlbGxpdGUtcHJvZ3JhbXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Problems with satellite programs forced Airbus to take 600 million euros ($650 million) in charges in 2023.

The company announced the charges, 200 million euros higher than previously reported, in the company’s 2023 financial results released Feb. 15. “They account for revised timelines, they account for better cost estimates, as well as for the reassessment of the commercial risk and also the opportunities that we have,” said Thomas Toepfer, Airbus chief financial officer, at a briefing about the results.

He did not elaborate on the specific issues that caused the charges but suggested that the company had at least a better understanding of the problems. “While I would say that this high-tech business always carries some risk, we have now a balanced assessment of the business in our accounts.”

Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus, also avoided going into details about problems with space programs. “It’s been a bumpy ride in 2023,” he said, attributing the charges to “too-optimistic assumptions” on long-term programs that forced the company to revise costs. “We came to the conclusion that we had to rebaseline or put charges to reflect better what we think is ahead of us.”

“If you look at the overall charges that we took for the space programs, it’s really a mixed bag of many, many things,” Toepfer said. That included, he said, issues with suppliers keeping up with Airbus plans as well as internal issues within Airbus.

One program that contributed to the charges is OneSat, a new line of geostationary orbit communications satellites with software-defined payloads. Faury acknowledged the company took charges “big time” on OneSat but did not disclose how much of the 600 million euros in charges in 2023 were attributed to that program.

“We remain committed to the program. It’s a fantastic platform,” he said. “We will keep moving with this program, for which we have already taken customer commitments for, as far I remember, slightly less than 10 satellites, with more to come.”

The latest order for a OneSat satellite was from Thaicom in September, which Airbus said at the time was the ninth order for that line of satellites. Other customers include Intelsat, Optus, Sky Perfect JSAT, Viasat by way of its acquisition of Inmarsat, and one undisclosed customer.

Faury also said that Airbus was still studying whether and how to replace two of its Pléiades Neo high-resolution imaging satellites. Those spacecraft were lost in the December 2022 Vega-C launch failure. Airbus currently operates two Pléiades Neo satellites launched in 2021, providing images at resolutions as sharp as 30 centimeters.

“There’s a strong demand for the images from Pléiades Neo,” he said. “We are considering replacing — partially, completely — the lost capacity of the last two Pléiades Neo satellites that were lost, but we have not yet decided on which of the scenarios” the company will take to replace that capacity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9939345717430115}",neutral,0.9939345717430115,0

2024 guidance issued

Amsterdam, 15 February 2024 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated Full-Year (FY) 2023 financial results and provided guidance for 2024.

“In 2023 we recorded strong order intake across all our businesses and we delivered on our commitments. This was a significant achievement given the complexity of the operating environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to invest in our global industrial system, while progressing on our transformation and decarbonisation journey. Our dividend proposals are a reflection of the strong 2023 financials, our growth prospects in 2024 and balance sheet strength.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 2,319 (2022: 1,078 aircraft) with net orders of 2,094 aircraft after cancellations (2022: 820 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 8,598 commercial aircraft at the end of 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 393 net orders (2022: 362 units), which were well spread across programmes and corresponds to a book-to-bill ratio above 1 both in units and value. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased 15 percent to € 15.7 billion (2022: € 13.7 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill of around 1.4 by value. Fourth quarter orders included 16 C295 aircraft for Spain.

Consolidated order intake by value increased to € 186.5 billion (2022: € 82.5 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 554 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 449 billion). The increase in the consolidated backlog value mainly reflects the Company-wide book-to-bill of well above 1, partly offset by the weakening of the US dollar.

Consolidated revenues increased 11 percent year-on-year to € 65.4 billion (2022: € 58.8 billion). A total of 735 commercial aircraft were delivered (2022: 661(1) aircraft), comprising 68 A220s, 571 A320 Family, 32 A330s and 64 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 15 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries were stable at 346 units (2022: 344 units) with revenues rising 4 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 2 percent, mainly driven by Military Air Systems and Connected Intelligence, offset by some updated Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes. A total of 8 A400M military airlifters were delivered (2022: 10 aircraft).

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 5,838 million (2022: € 5,627 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 4,818 million (2022: € 4,600 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. FY 2022 included the non-recurring positive impacts from retirement obligations and compliance-related topics partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia, while in H1 2023 provisions were released for € 0.1 billion from compliance-related topics.

The A220 ramp-up continues towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026, with a focus on the programme's industrial maturity and financial performance. On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. In 2023, construction of the second A320 Final Assembly capacities in Tianjin (China) and Mobile (US) commenced and the new A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Toulouse delivered its first aircraft in December. The first customer A321XLR entered into the Final Assembly Line in December, with entry-into-service for the aircraft type expected to take place in Q3 2024.

On widebody aircraft, the Company continues towards a monthly rate of 4 aircraft for the A330 in 2024 and rate 10 in 2026 for the A350.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 735 million (2022: € 639 million), reflecting the strong performance across programmes and services. FY 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 229 million (2022: € 384 million).

The decrease reflects € 0.6 billion charges resulting from the update of Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes, partially mitigated by the performance of the rest of the business. FY 2022 included some non-recurring elements, notably from the loss of two Pleiades Neo satellites.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In 2023, an additional update of the contract estimate at completion has been performed and a net charge of € 41 million recorded. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 3,257 million (2022: € 3,079 million).

Consolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 4,603 million (2022: € 5,325 million), including net Adjustments of € -1,235 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ -1,030 million related to the dollar working capital mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -224 million were in Q4. This mainly reflects the phasing impact arising from the difference between transaction date and delivery date;

€ -89 million related to the Aerostructures transformation, of which € -32 million were in Q4;

€ -41 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -41 million were in Q4;

€ -75 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -19 million were in Q4.

The financial result was € 166 million (2022: € -250 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(2) was € 3,789 million (2022: € 4,247 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 4.80 (2022: € 5.40).

Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was € 4,386 million (2022: € 4,680 million), mainly reflecting the level of commercial aircraft deliveries as well as the strong performance in all businesses. Consolidated free cash flow of € 3,885 million (2022: € 4,324 million) included € -65 million for M&A activities and € -436 million of customer financing, mostly related to the planned execution of certain contractual obligations. The gross cash position stood at € 25.3 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 10.7 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion).

The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2023 dividend of € 1.80 per share (2022: € 1.80 per share) and a special dividend of € 1.00 per share to the 2024 Annual General Meeting taking place on 10 April 2024. The proposed payment date is 18 April 2024.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2024 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2024 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2024:

Around 800 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted between € 6.5 billion and € 7.0 billion;

Free Cash Flow before Customer Financing(3) of around € 4.0 billion.

Airbus awards landmark aerospace order for A220 aircraft doors to Bengaluru-based Dynamatic Technologies - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1hd2FyZHMtbGFuZG1hcmstYWVyb3NwYWNlLW9yZGVyLWZvci1hMjIwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRvb3JzLXRvLWJlbmdhbHVyddIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delhi, 8 February 2024: Giving a significant push to the Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ vision, Airbus has awarded a contract for the manufacturing and assembly of its A220 Family aircraft doors to Bengaluru-based Dynamatic Technologies.

This is one of the largest aerospace export contracts to India. The contract will support the ramp-up of the A220 programme by creating additional capacity to the currently existing source. Under the agreement, Dynamatic will manufacture and assemble the cargo, passenger and service doors along with the over-wing emergency exit doors for the A220 family aircraft (eight doors per aircraft). The doors contract includes the manufacturing of detailed parts components, which will create downstream opportunities for the other Indian suppliers.

This is the second doors contract awarded by Airbus to an Indian supplier in less than one year. In 2023, Airbus gave the contract for the manufacturing of bulk and cargo doors of the A320 Family to Tata Advanced Systems Ltd.

A long-standing partner to Airbus, Dynamatic already manufactures the Flap Track Beam of the Airbus A330 and A320 Family aircraft as well as the cockpit escape hatch door of the A220.

For Airbus, India is a strategic resource hub where the company is expanding its industrial footprint with aircraft assembly, component manufacturing, engineering design and development, MRO support, pilot and maintenance training as well as academic collaboration to foster human capital.

Today, every Airbus commercial aircraft has components and technologies made in India. Currently, Airbus’ procurement of components and services from India stands at about US$750 million every year, which will rise to US$1.5 billion in the next few years. Airbus’ efforts to mature the wider Indian aerospace ecosystem also includes the building of two Final Assembly Lines: One for the C295 military aircraft in Vadodara and the second one for the H125 helicopter.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market and brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and latest-generation technologies and engines. Featuring a 50% reduced noise footprint and up to 25% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, as well as around 40% lower NOx emissions than industry standards, the A220 is perfectly suited for regional as well as long distance routes.

Airbus is raising the bar for sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1pcy1yYWlzaW5nLXRoZS1iYXItZm9yLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLWZ1ZWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2023, Airbus used more than 11 million litres of SAF in its operations – two times the volume of 2022. This exceeded the initial 2023 target of 10% of the total fuel used across Airbus’ divisions by more than a million litres and accounted for 2% of all SAF produced in the world over the year! This achievement contributed to the reduction of CO 2 emissions by 23,587 tonnes. Here is how Airbus did it…

In transport and operations

The Beluga is flying daily to move parts from manufacturing sites to final assembly lines. Since December 2019, Airbus is using SAF in these oversized operations as a key contributor in the roadmap to decarbonise.

In employee travels

Working with airlines Volotea and AirCorsica, Airbus supplies SAF for internal business travel. With the aim to reduce employee CO 2 footprint, Airbus signed an agreement with Air France in 2023 to purchase SAF when travelling between five cities in Europe. This number will increase with more employee routes supplied with SAF as Airbus seeks to sign agreements with other airlines.

In flight tests

Flight tests play an important role in the growing use of SAF at Airbus. Airbus Helicopters is using SAF for development test flights and training in Marignane, France, and Donauwörth, Germany, and conducts demo flights like the one in Paris Air Show 2023 with the H160.

In Airbus Commercial Aircraft business, the second VOLCAN test flight campaign kicked off in March 2023, using an A321neo powered by 100% SAF, analysing residual emissions.

The A321XLR passenger test flight in October 2023 made sure Airbus employees were among the first to fly on Airbus’ extra-long range single-aisle aircraft, while flying with 30% SAF.

H145 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) refueling

In aircraft deliveries

In 2023, Airbus delivered more aircraft with SAF than any other year, thanks to its increased availability for customers at Airbus delivery centres worldwide. Airbus has been proposing SAF to customers since 2016, however the company took it a step further when it started offering airlines up to 5% pure SAF, at no extra cost, to support their own decarbonisation journey. IndiGo was the first customer to take advantage of this offer for the delivery of a new A320neo from Toulouse.

Airbus Helicopters delivery flights are routinely performed with SAF when available. The intent is to increase SAF use across Airbus Helicopters Customer Centres worldwide, with the target of almost half a million litres of neat SAF in 2024.

With partners

To help the industry meet its goal of 17.5 billion litres of SAF by 2030, Airbus partners with energy producers, airlines and airports around the world. The goal is to anticipate and project future volumes. This is why Airbus has joined initiatives such as the French “SAF in Occitanie'' and the Japanese “Act for Sky” among many others! Airbus has also made a significant contribution to the development of local SAF production in Australia through a partnership with Qantas and the Queensland Government. In November 2023, under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ACT-SAF initiative, Airbus and ICAO signed a Declaration of Intent to assess South America’s SAF feedstocks and production. Together with China National Aviation Fuel (CNAF), Airbus signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen Chinese-European collaboration on SAF production, and standard formulation. Airbus set up a strategic partnership with DG fuels in the United States to support new technology and fuel production. Likewise, Airbus teamed up with Lanzajet to advance the building of SAF facilities. Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Airbus and Masdar, an Abu Dhabi energy company, to further develop SAF production.

All of these efforts - and more like them - were led by teams across Airbus, in every region of the world, and contributed to the Company’s 2023 objective to use 10% SAF in operations and customer deliveries. They have enabled Airbus to be a major SAF user globally. And while this is an important achievement, Airbus has set an even greater target for 2024 amounting to an average 15% of SAF in the fuel mix.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9836533069610596}",neutral,0.9836533069610596,0

Advancing eVTOL operations in Japan - Airbus,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAyLWFkdmFuY2luZy1ldnRvbC1vcGVyYXRpb25zLWluLWphcGFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the recent completion of CityAirbus NextGen’s assembly, Airbus’ advanced air mobility teams are focused on putting together the major components that make up the eVTOL prototype, gearing up for its first flight later this year. In addition to reaching this major milestone, the teams continue to work on the development of the entire ecosystem, which will be necessary to operate CityAirbus NextGen. Indeed, beyond the vehicle that will transport passengers in and around urban areas, dedicated infrastructure, public acceptance, regulations of lower airspace and efficient takeoff and landing sites are all essential to the development of viable advanced air mobility services.

In order to provide passengers with the right service and seamlessly integrate it into their daily lives, it is essential to find the right use cases and the right flight routes for eVTOLs. In Japan, Airbus and helicopter operator Hiratagakuen partnered in 2022 to do just that, by evaluating the potential of CityAirbus NextGen for different types of missions in the Kansai region. We take a deep dive into the latest findings of their research and what’s next to develop advanced air mobility services in Japan.

Flying in real conditions

The first phase of the partnership started in mid-2022 and successfully ended in March 2023. During this time, Airbus and Hiratagakuen used an H135 helicopter to test advanced navigation and communication technologies for safe operations of eVTOLs in urban environments, while simulating CityAirbus NextGen’s flight configuration. The partners’ work focused on two use cases: ecotourism and passenger transport. The H135 followed three different flight routes in the Osaka and Kansai regions, to test how CityAirbus NextGen would be able to perform these missions with safe, comfortable, convenient and memorable flight experiences for passengers in busy and complex traffic control areas in and around cities in Japan. The paths linked Kansai International airport to Osaka City, Kobe Airport to Kansai International Airport and Awaji Island to Osaka City. In order to push the representation to the top, the flight conditions of the helicopter were modified to be similar to those of CityAirbus NextGen. “The flights were conducted at a low altitude, of about 500 m. The standard flight altitude for a helicopter would be closer to 600-1000 m. The flight speed was also adapted to CityAirbus NextGen’s cruise speed of 100-120 km/h, instead of 200-250 km/h for a helicopter. It really is a comprehensive test of what eVTOLs would be able to achieve and we obtained good and interesting results in this environment,” says Mitsuhiro Hirata, Vice President, Head of Aviation Operation Division of Hiratagakuen.

A successful simulation

So what does this tell us? “Most of all, the simulation flights proved that these are flyable routes for an eVTOL, and that satellite signals worked perfectly in these urban environments,” explains Mitsuhiro Hirata. This first series of simulation flights was an important milestone on the airspace management side: it allowed Airbus and Hiratagakuen to start mapping out the required flight corridors to be monitored in lower airspace with advanced air traffic control systems. Additionally, both partners made progress to determine the location of the required ground infrastructure, whether relying on existing helipads or assessing where vertiports would need to be set up in city centres to ensure the optimisation of passengers’ journeys. Phase 1 of the partnership marked the first time a helicopter flew this low over the urban zones, with all three flight routes covering densely populated areas. This was an opportunity to rely on the H135’s advanced autopilot system to simulate the increased level of autonomous operations in eVTOL flights. “During the flights, the accuracy of the auto-pilot was confirmed by the dedicated equipment installed on the helicopter,” says Balkiz Sarihan, Head of Urban Air Mobility, Airbus. The behaviour of the satellite signals was assessed, gathering important insight into how eVTOLs would be able to fly in operational conditions that include urban environments with numerous buildings around.

The partnership between Airbus and Hiratagakuen will help evaluate the potential of eVTOLs for passenger transport and ecotourism applications

Phase 2 under way

And there is still a lot to learn. Launched in mid-2023, phase 2 of the partnership is all about testing the potential air medical use of eVTOLs in Japan’s cities and mountainous areas. Complementing helicopters’ work in these essential missions, CityAirbus NextGen’s added value will be measured through simulation flights in two different configurations. On the one hand, to transport blood between the blood supply centres of Osaka and Kobe, covering a distance of 35 km. On the other hand, test flights will simulate the transport of blood from the blood supply centre in Kobe to a hospital in Hyogo Prefecture, covering 40-55 km. The Japan Weather Association will be a key player in this second project, to investigate the best routes to fly over the mountainous area, bringing essential input through high-precision weather data. The winter season will be an important period for the second project. Flight availability is usually reduced during the season due to bad weather and strong winds. As a result, the simulations will also serve to measure how much time can be saved by using different combinations of transport services. “This part of the simulation will help us understand where exactly an eVTOL could be added into the air medical ecosystem to leverage all aerial and ground assets in an optimal way”, explains Balkiz Sarihan. Stay tuned to learn more.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999905824661255}",neutral,0.9999905824661255,0

Breeze Airways discloses order for 10 additional A220 aircraft; announces all-A220 commercial operation by end of 2024 - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMi1icmVlemUtYWlyd2F5cy1kaXNjbG9zZXMtb3JkZXItZm9yLTEwLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYTIyMC1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Herndon, USA/Mirabel, Canada, 20 February 2024 – Breeze Airways has disclosed an order for 10 additional A220-300 aircraft, bringing the airline’s total firm order for the aircraft type to 90, making Breeze the third largest customer worldwide for the A220.

“Thanks to its world class performance capabilities, the A220 is the perfect aircraft to help Breeze achieve its goal to provide nonstop service between underserved routes across the United States,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales, Commercial Aircraft, Airbus. “The aircraft offers efficient operations and an outstanding passenger experience, all while operating with the world's lowest small single-aisle carbon footprint and a lower noise footprint in the communities where it flies. This additional order from Breeze is a strong endorsement for the value and opportunities offered by this latest generation aircraft.”

In addition to its positive cabin experience, the aircraft plays an important role in helping decrease airline operating costs and environmental impact. The aircraft can fly non-stop up to 3,600 nautical miles or 6,700 kilometres. Offering 25% lower fuel burn and CO 2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, the A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market. Combining state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines, the A220 brings customers a 50% reduced noise footprint when compared to previous generation aircraft and around 40% lower NOx emissions than industry standards. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Breeze took delivery of its first Airbus A220 in December 2021 and is operating 20 aircraft (as of end January 2024) throughout the United States. Breeze also announced it will be using an all-A220 fleet for its commercial operations by the end of 2024.

With more than 300 A220s delivered to 20 airlines operating on five continents including the recent addition of Oceania, the A220 is the optimal aircraft to offer operational flexibility for both regional as well as long-distance routes. To date, more than 100 million passengers have flown on the A220. The fleet is currently flying on more than 1,350 routes and more than 400 destinations worldwide. As of the end of January 2024, around 30 customers have ordered more than 900 A220 aircraft - confirming its leading position in the small single-aisle market.

First Deliveries of New Airbus A321XLR Plane Delayed Again - Skift Travel News,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvZmlyc3QtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1vZi1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHItcGxhbmUtZGVsYXllZC1hZ2Fpbi_SAVxodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzAyLzE1L2ZpcnN0LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtb2YtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxeGxyLXBsYW5lLWRlbGF5ZWQtYWdhaW4vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Developing new aircraft is rarely easy, but this fresh delay to the company’s flagship narrowbody jet program will come as a disappointment to Airbus and its customers.

The first of Airbus’ new line of jets won’t arrive as soon as expected. The setback was revealed today by CEO Guillaume Faury as the company published its annual results.

The Airbus A321XLR (Xtra-Long Range) is due to be the planemaker’s flagship single-aisle product. It builds upon the hugely successful A320 and A321 programs, which are already the cornerstone of fleets at JetBlue, Frontier Airlines, and easyJet.

The XLR has been in development for several years. When the project was first announced in 2019, a target of summer 2023 was given for the first delivery.

More recently, executives at the European firm have said the second quarter of 2024 would be the date of the first handover. Now, it will be at least the third quarter before the first airline receives the new jet.

What’s Delaying Airbus’ New Plane?

Speaking to the media, Faury said he was satisfied with the overall progress of the program, but acknowledged that regulatory issues had caused the further delay.

“We are in the finalization of the documents. [For] certification we need to close all of them and there are thousands,” said the Airbus CEO.

To squeeze even more flying range out of the same aircraft shell, Airbus has had to get creative. The XLR features an extra fuel tank, molded into the contours of the central-rear part of the aircraft.

While this allows the plane to fly up to 15% further, it has concerned safety regulators. Officials have highlighted fire risks and lengthier evacuations in the event of an accident. Subsequent tweaks to the design and the resulting tests to satisfy aviation authorities have taken time.

Which Companies Are Waiting?

Despite the delays, the XLR has proved to be a hit with airlines. More than 550 XLRs have been ordered to date, with customers around the world. These include big-name national carriers such as Qantas and American Airlines, as well as more niche players like VietJet and flynas.

Last month, IndiGo Airlines CEO Pieter Elbers told Skift about his grand plans to link India and Europe with the new aircraft.

While Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines was officially the first to order the jet – signing a deal for four units in 2019 – it is another flag carrier that looks set to be the launch operator.

Recent comments from IAG, the parent company of Aer Lingus, suggest that it’s the Irish airline that will fly the aircraft first in revenue service. With a maximum range of 4,700 nautical miles (5,409 miles), Aer Lingus will be able to fly from Dublin deep into the U.S. using a single-aisle plane.

Other operators such as United Airlines and Icelandair are looking to the XLR to replace aging Boeing 757s which are more expensive to run and have poorer environmental credentials.

For its part, Boeing scrapped plans to build a direct competitor to the A321XLR in 2020, leaving the company almost entirely reliant on its 737 Max program.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8254626393318176}",neutral,0.8254626393318176,0

Resolutions include the renewal of Chairman René Obermann’s Board Mandate as well as those of fellow non-executive directors Victor Chu, Jean-Pierre Clamadieu and Amparo Moraleda. One resolution proposes the appointment of Dr. Feiyu Xu as a non-executive director, replacing Ralph D. Crosby, Jr., who resigned with effect of the date of the AGM having served on the Board since 2013. Dr. Xu would be appointed for a term of two years, corresponding to the remainder of Mr. Crosby’s mandate.

Dr. Xu is a member of the Supervisory Board of technology company ZF Friedrichshafen AG and a leading expert in the application of artificial intelligence in industry. Thanks to her deep technology knowledge, Dr. Xu will be able to support the Company to strategise the impact of emerging technologies on its business.

Airbus Board mandates are renewed at each AGM in blocks of four for three years, in order to ensure a smooth transition of the Board composition, and that the appropriate skills are retained among the directors. This also avoids large block replacements of directors at any single AGM.

Also on the voting agenda is the proposed payment of a 2023 gross dividend of € 1.80 per share (2022: € 1.80 per share) and a special dividend of € 1.00 per share, as communicated in the Full-Year results disclosure on 15 February.

Documents for the AGM, including the Information Notice with a full agenda, are available online at: https://www.airbus.com/en/investors/annual-general-meetings. The meeting starts at 1.30pm CEST on 10 April 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",neutral,0.9999972581863403,0

PARIS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus AIR.PA unveiled a special dividend on Thursday after posting higher 2023 results, buoyed by resurgent demand for jetliners and despite a fresh charge of 200 million euros ($215 million) at its troubled Space business.

The world's largest commercial planemaker said core adjusted operating profit rose 4% to 5.8 billion euros as revenue climbed 11% to 65.4 billion, and predicted core profit of 6.5 to 7.0 billion euros in 2024.

For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings came in just below market forecasts compiled by the company at 2.21 billion euros.

Airbus is riding a wave of orders from airlines coping with a rebound in travel demand from the pandemic, helping it to build up cash reserves in contrast with U.S. rival Boeing BA.N which is mired in debts stemming from a series of crises.

Airbus proposed an unchanged regular dividend of 1.8 euros a share, and added a special dividend of 1 euro per share as net cash topped the 10-billion-euro threshold previously identified as a potential trigger for returning more cash to shareholders.

Shares were fractionally lower in early trading, however, with some analysts pointing to cautious financial forecasts for 2024 and a lack of fresh updates on a broader share buyback.

Investors have been pushing Airbus for a buyback as it extends a lead over Boeing in the single-aisle jet market.

Chief Financial Officer Thomas Toepfer said Airbus had chosen the special dividend to act quickly and to signal that it was sticking to its pledges on distributing cash.

Airbus forecast around 800 jet deliveries for 2024 but announced a further delay in entry to service of its A321XLR single-aisle jet to the third quarter from the second. The first customer airplane entered final assembly in December.

The company's forecasts are subject to no further disruption to tight global supply chains or the world economy.

Some analysts found the outlook cautious, even though Airbus and others continue to wrestle with supply constraints.

""We had seen 800 (deliveries) as the floor that investors were looking for, and had also expected 7 billion euros as the EBIT guide,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.

PRODUCTION TARGET

The Space unit charge brings the total written off in that segment last year to 600 million euros and comes a day after Reuters reported that CEO Guillaume Faury had told staff that large, unexpected charges in the business were """".

The charges helped push divisional Defence and Space profits down 40% to 229 million euros while Helicopters rose 15%.

Airbus is among European companies facing fierce competition from U.S. launchers and a new generation of low-cost satellites.

Faury, however, told staff in a letter last month that Airbus is better off with a high-performing Defence and Space business than without a presence in those areas.

On Thursday, he said Airbus would continue to monitor its exposure in Space.

Faury also said Airbus was ""on our plan"" to reach a key production target of 75 single-aisle jets a month in 2026 and that he remained confident in the goal, which is central to Airbus' industrial plans in the busiest part of the market.

Some suppliers remain more conservative, however, telling Reuters that Airbus is producing around 50 of the jets a month compared to a production plan that had foreseen 58 by end-2023.

Each year, the company welcomes more than 100,000 customers from all over the world, providing a nine minute, 27 kilometre sightseeing tour over Niagara Falls.

“In order to continue to deliver a first-class visitor experience, we felt it was time to upgrade our aircraft,” says Denis Pilon, Chief Operating Officer for Niagara Helicopters. “After nearly 10 years of working with Airbus Helicopters, we are confident that the H130 continues to be the ideal aircraft for our operation. We are pleased to be working with the Airbus team again. We look forward to many more years of cooperation and collaboration.”

The aircraft of choice for tourism, the H130 has a wide, unobstructed cabin which accommodates the pilot and up to seven passengers, providing outstanding visibility through a large wrap-around windscreen and wide windows. Its state-of-the-art technologies, materials, systems and avionics make it a quiet and powerful helicopter. A single-engine helicopter, the H130 is known for its widespread use with sightseeing services, charter operators and emergency medical services.

In addition to the H130’s panoramic seating, the active vibration control system and improved air conditioning contribute to its unbeatable level of comfort.

Airbus hails ‘landmark year’ with strong 2023 results amid delivery ramp-up - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi8xNS9haXJidXMtaGFpbHMtbGFuZG1hcmsteWVhci13aXRoLXN0cm9uZy0yMDIzLXJlc3VsdHMtYW1pZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1yYW1wLXVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Tom Batchelor

February 15, 2024, © Leeham News: Airbus gave more details of its planned ramp-up today as it announced 2023 full-year results, with revenues climbing 11% year-on-year to €65bn and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) up 4% to €5.8bn.

The European manufacturer is targeting 800 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2024, above the 735 delivered last year, an increase of almost 9%. Airbus is seeking a ramp-up in production to meet increased output targets across its commercial division, including 75/mo for the global A320 family program.

Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive officer, told investors that the company was seeking to strike a balance between “very strong demand” for its aircraft and “the ability of the supply chain to meet the demand.”

Faury said 2023 had been a “landmark year” with a “record-breaking level of aircraft orders and backlog”. He added: “We continue to see momentum for civil and defense markets.”

However, the Airbus Defense and Space division continues to struggle with adjusted EBIT down 40% year-on-year, to €229m from €384m.

Across all of its business segments, Airbus said it expects to achieve EBIT Adjusted of between €6.5bn and €7bn in 2024.

Group-level results

Revenue for 2023 was €65.4bn, up from €58.8bn in 2022; EBIT adjusted reached €5.8bn, up from €5.6bn 2022, and EBIT reported was €4.6bn (down from €5.3bn in 2022). That negative adjustment was driven by dollar working capital mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, and other costs including €41m related to the A400M program.

Free cash flow was €3.8bn (€4.3bn in 2022), and the net cash position at the end of 2023 reached €10.7bn (€9.4bn in 2022).

For 2024, Airbus is targeting:

Around 800 commercial aircraft deliveries (which falls within investors’ minimum range of expectations);

EBIT Adjusted between €6.5bn and €7.0bn;

Free Cash Flow before customer financing of around €4.0bn.

Commercial aircraft

Gross commercial aircraft orders totaled 2,319 in 2023 (2022: 1,078 aircraft) and net orders stood at 2,094 aircraft (2022: 820 aircraft).

The order backlog amounted to 8,598 commercial aircraft at the end of 2023.

Reflecting on the ongoing crisis engulfing Boeing over the 737 MAX-9 door plug incident, Faury told investors that as Airbus ramps up production, “safety and quality [are] at the heart of all that we do.” But he added that the company’s “philosophy has not changed” and said it would have no impact on the timeline for development of next-generation aircraft.

On the much-anticipated A321XLR, Airbus confirmed delivery has been pushed back from the second to the third quarter of 2024. The first customer A321XLR entered into the Final Assembly Line in December.

“For most of the customers, that doesn’t change the delivery date that is planned,” Faury said, adding that a “handful” of the aircraft would be delivered this year and ramp-up would begin in 2025.

Commenting on wider delays within the supply chain, Faury said: “The supply chain is a world of bottlenecks at the moment. There is not a single bottleneck to be resolved – there are plenty of them.” He listed the engine supply chain as one area that the company was specifically monitoring and said Airbus was assisting suppliers with additional support to avoid new “ruptures in the supply chain.”

“The supply chain is improving, but as they keep improving we keep asking for more. There is a permanent tension between what they are producing and what we need,” he said.

Elsewhere, the A220 ramp-up continues towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026, and Airbus said A320 Family production was “progressing well” towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026.

In 2023, construction of the second A320 Final Assembly capacities in Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, commenced and the new A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Toulouse delivered its first aircraft in December.

On widebody aircraft, Airbus continues towards a monthly rate of four aircraft per month for the A330 in 2024, and a rate of 10 in 2026 for the A350.

Helicopters

Airbus Helicopters registered 393 net orders (vs. 362 units in 2022). The company said these were “well spread across programs,” corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio above 1 both in units and value.

Airbus Helicopters revenues increased 4% to €7.3bn (from €7bn in 2022), and adjusted EBIT increased 15% to €735m (2022: €639m).

Defense and Space

Airbus Defense and Space had a difficult 2023. While the order intake by value increased 15% to €15.7bn (2022: €13.7 billion), EBIT adjusted was down to €229m, from €384m in 2022.

Faury said the division endured a “bumpy ride last year”. He said a priority for Airbus would now be to “transform the defense and space division”.

Late last year the company incurred a €300m quarterly charge on satellite developments, reportedly linked to the OneSat family, among other programs.

Airbus to introduce A330neo takeoff performance enhancements - Airbus Aircraft,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQtMDItYWlyYnVzLXRvLWludHJvZHVjZS1hMzMwbmVvLXRha2VvZmYtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZW5oYW5jZW1lbnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since its first delivery in November 2018 and with over 120 aircraft in service today, the A330neo Family has already received various incremental improvements. These include: a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) increase from its originally certified 242 metric tonnes to 251 tonnes; certification to ICAO’s 2028 CO2 emissions standard; higher “Max-Pax” capacity increase for the A330-900 from 440 to 460 seats in nine-abreast all-economy; as well as a Trent 7000 HP-turbine engine durability enhancement package from Rolls-Royce – doubling the in-service blade life for increased time-on-wing.

Continuing the A330neo’s evolution trend: From around Q4 2025, customers will be able to take delivery of an aircraft with even more operational performance and flexibility thanks to the next incremental package, referred to as “Step 4”. This will focus on enhancing the aircraft’s low-speed performance. This is achieved by further maximising lift and reducing drag during the take-off and subsequent climb-out phases.

Enhancing take-off performance for greater uplift

With the Step 4 package A330-900 operators will be able to benefit from an extra take-off-weight uplift capability of around 2.6 metric tonnes at some airports, while at other, even more runway-restricted airports, the net gain could be as much as four tonnes – and all without increasing the engine’s thrust. Airports where such operators could expect gains include: Madrid, Minneapolis, Reunion, Dusseldorf, Bogota, Gatwick and Mumbai – among others.

It should be noted that the drag reduction and lift improvement are achieved by two main enablers used together: The first is the provision of some intermediate flap settings, known as ‘Enhanced Take-Off Configurations’ (ETOC). The second enabler is the implementation of faster landing gear + landing gear door retraction sequences. These are respectively described below.

Enhanced Take-Off Configurations with new intermediate flap and slat settings

To understand how ETOC works, one first needs to understand that today the A330 and A320 Families’ common-cockpit has five flap/slat lever settings: Flaps-0 being fully retracted, thru positions -1, -2, -3, and finally ‘Full’. On take-off the flap setting chosen depends on the available runway length and engine thrust settings – plus other factors such as second-segment climb obstacle clearance etc.. In general, the higher the flap setting the greater is the associated lift produced during take-off. However, a higher flap setting also naturally creates more aerodynamic drag (which could impact the aircraft’s acceleration), especially during the initial climb phase. Therefore, if the runway length allows, a lower flap setting is usually preferred. Thus “Flaps-Two” is a typical setting, since it provides a good balance between extra lift needed for take-off and lower drag for the subsequent accelerating climb-out whilst maintaining the required flight-path angle.





Nevertheless, since there is still quite a significant aerodynamic ‘jump’ between each of the respective five flap-lever settings today, Airbus has identified scope for further performance optimisation and smoothing-out the flap and slat transitions by introducing intermediate ‘bridging’ flap positions – ie. slotting between Flaps-One and Flaps-Two, and between Flaps-2 and Flaps-3 and Flaps-Full respectively.

To this end, engineers on A330neo programme have developed ETOC which requires no physical changes to the aircraft: From next year, pilots of newly delivered A330-900s will be able to enter the intermediate flap settings into the Multi-Function Control & Display Unit’s (MCDU) ‘Performance’ page. The four extra flap positions (in addition to the existing five flap lever settings) are denoted as: 1B, 2B, 2C and 3B – making nine positions in total. The particular take-off flap setting and corresponding take-off ‘V-speed’ values will be provided to the pilot by the Electronic Flight Bag’s (EFB’s) runway performance calculator app.

Once flap levers are set (eg. to 1+F, -2, or -3), the aircraft’s avionics will automatically move the slats and flaps on the wing to the desired intermediate position (eg. Flaps-2A / 2B etc.) for take-off – as set already in the MCDU. For ETOC implementation, there are no physical changes to the actual flap-lever itself. However, some avionic computer hardware modifications are also required, such as to the ‘Flight Management Guidance and Envelope Computer’ (FMGEC).

Faster and earlier landing gear & door retraction sequencing

It should be noted that ETOC is coupled with another drag-reducing measure which reduces the first-segment climb duration. This reduction is targeted through two improvements: Shortening the landing gear retraction time by around 0.8 seconds; and reducing the landing gear doors’ opening & closing time by around 0.2 seconds. The modification consists of a new main landing gear (MLG) retraction actuator and flow hydraulic control device, plus new MLG door actuators.

As well as reducing the retraction time itself, the landing gear retraction sequence also commences a couple of seconds earlier after take-off than with today's aircraft. This shorter cycle is achieved via a new ‘Automatic Landing Gear Door Opening’ (ALGDO) function. When an engine failure is detected during take-off, this automatically commands the landing gear doors to open one second after lift-off. This is different to the current sequence in which the door opening sequence starts three seconds after lift-off, triggered by the landing gear lever.

Further A330neo enhancement studies

The A330neo’s development story does not stop here. Indeed, Airbus is already considering the next set of value-adding incremental evolutions for its customers, along two main axes: efficiency and sustainability. These include payload and performance optimisations, 100% SAF certification... and much more – so watch this space!","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999362230300903}",positive,0.9999362230300903,1

Airbus Racer prepares for first flight - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJhY2VyLXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Racer is set for its first flight in the next few weeks, as Airbus Helicopters prepares to begin its journey towards a target of 200 flight hours on the high-speed demonstrator.

Developed under the framework of the European Clean Sky 2 project, the Racer aims to build on the legacy of the Airbus X3. While that aircraft reached a high speed of 255 knots, Airbus is targeting 220 knots at full speed for the Racer.

The Racer has two pusher propellers attached on the end of box wings. Oliver Johnson Photo

“The Racer is a bit different [to the aim with the X3],” Brice Makinadjian, Racer’s chief engineer, told journalists during a briefing ahead of Heli-Expo 2024. “The idea is to come closer to operational configurations, giving potential customers good capacity in terms of payload and range. So it’s not only [built for] speed.”

The aircraft is close to the final configuration for its first flight, and Makinadjian said it represented a move closer to an aircraft that could be certified, compared with the X3.

Drag reduction is a key element of the design. Makinadjian highlighted the optimization of the faring, which reduces drag by 25 percent over a conventional design, and noted the importance of the Racer’s narrow fuselage.

The box wings — an upper and lower wing that connect the pusher propellers to the fuselage — serve several purposes. Having one wing above the other helps reduce the amount of surface area exposed to the rotor’s downwash, improving hover efficiency, and also allows the landing gear to be fully integrated into the fuselage (reducing drag).

In forward flight at high speed, the wing provides 50 percent of the lift. At this speed, the main rotor speed is slowed by about 10 percent to keep the blade tip speed below Mach 1.

Brice Makinadjian, Racer’s chief engineer (left), and Julien Guitton, head of the Racer program (second from left) speak to journalists at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France. Oliver Johnson Photo

The box wing also creates a vortex in forward flight that helps to improve the efficiency of the pusher propeller behind it — by about six to eight percent, said Makinadjian.

The aircraft has an asymmetrical tail boom, and this helps to enhance performance in a hover, generating loads in a lateral direction that help counteract the torque from the main rotor.

Makinadjian highlighted the maturity of the technologies being used in the Racer, as well as the simplicity of the design.

“The gearbox is connected to the two engines, as we do on a conventional aircraft,” he said. “The only change is that we have two lateral drive lines that are coming through the upper wing that are connecting the main gearbox to the lateral gearbox, connecting the torque to the lateral rotor. So it’s very simple, everything is going in the direction of reducing the cost and also the maintenance costs.”

Airbus has also aimed to keep piloting as simple as possible. With no tilting element to manage, Makinadjian said conventional helicopter pilots can fly the Racer with just a 20-minute briefing. While the real aircraft is yet to the leave the ground, pilots have flown the aircraft on a simulator following the briefing without any issues, he added.

Airbus will soon begin final quality inspections of the demonstrator, which will then move to the flight line to begin ground runs with the rotor turning.

“We will check the good functionality of the engine, tune the main rotor, tune the lateral rotors — really finalize the last few things,” said Julien Guitton, head of the Racer program. The anticipated timeline for first flight is before the end of March.

While the schedule has slipped to the right through the demonstrator’s build, Guitton said this was “linked to the innovation aspect” of the aircraft, but that the team has encountered no “major technical issues.”

The first flight will represent the conclusion of the Clean Sky Two project, but Guitton said it really represents “the beginning of the Racer,” with the manufacturer targeting an extensive flight test campaign that will likely last two years.

Follow a progressive opening of the flight envelope, a second phase will begin.

“We will explore completely the possible capacity of the Racer . . . not only speed, but what we can offer in terms of payload, range, [and] maneuverability,” said Guitton. [There are] a lot of parameters that we want to explore and concretely demonstrate.”

The second phase of flight tests will also include the installation of an engine that will allow the operator to trial “Eco Mode” — in which one of the two engines is put into idle during cruise flight to enhance efficiency. Makinadjian said it could reduce fuel burn by about 15 percent.

Noise reduction will also be trialled in future, with Racer having the ability to adjust its attitude during takeoff and landing to minimize the sound produced by the main rotor through blade vortex interaction. This adjustment is managed through the automatic flight control system.

“We can make the rotor disc so that the second blade is hitting the vortex a little bit higher or a little bit lower, the energy of the shock is much lower, and the noise is reduced,” said Makinadjian.

The tests will ultimately include demonstrations of civil and parapublic missions and scenarios, potentially with mission equipment installed.

“Clean Sky 2 was a wonderful opportunity and initiative. But now we want to go further and show what could be the future of high speed,” said Guitton. “We need to go further — that’s clear.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9537868499755859}",neutral,0.9537868499755859,0

ST Engineering signed the deals for MRO work during last week’s Singapore Airshow. They cover Airbus’ C-295 medium transport aircraft and Embraer’s C-390 Millennium airlifter.

ST Engineering has experience providing MRO services to the Republic of Singapore Air Force’s legacy aircraft, including A-4SU Super Skyhawk jets, a company representative told Defense News.

The firm has also performed MRO services for Airbus’ commercial line and conducted freighter conversions, but the recent agreement looks to expand work to the C-295, which will include depot-level maintenance.

Airbus executives said they have been looking for MRO partners in Asia, where 28 C-295 are currently in service with armed forces in Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and Bangladesh. The agreement with ST Engineering would only cover C-295 aircraft in the Asia-Pacific region, Airbus told with Defense News, and will not include aircraft from Bangladesh.

The C-295 can be used for surveillance and maritime patrol missions. The French firm Airbus anticipates an increase in C-295 orders following a rising demand for surveillance aircraft in the region.

A spokesperson from ST Engineering told Defense News the firm has not yet finalized the specific C-295 variants involved in the MRO collaboration.

Brazilian company Embraer signed a memorandum of understanding on MRO collaboration with ST Engineering for the C-390. An ST Engineering spokesperson told Defense News via email that the agreement covers engineering, support services and maintenance for the aircraft.

Embraer has not yet announced sales in Southeast Asia but anticipates demand for the C-390 airlifter. The two firms will also cooperate on radars and land systems; border security; simulation; advanced production technologies; command-and-control, communications and computer technologies; and intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, according to a news release.

Meanwhile, ST Engineering’s defense aviation services division announced a first-time collaboration with American company Honeywell amid ongoing overhaul work for two C-130s in service with the Tunisian Air Force.

The long-time agreement between the two companies will see Honeywell provide hardware and engineering support to ST Engineering for the Tunisian aircraft. This includes the integration of Honeywell’s Cockpit Display System Retrofit, a system composed of up to five large-format LCD color displays that provide flight controls, air data and altitude sensors.

With roles ranging from helicopter pilot to final assembly line supervisor to airworthiness engineer, Esther, Natalia, Vanessa, Maria Jesus, Sayo and Isabelle share with us the highlights of their day-to-day…and encourage others to explore the diverse career possibilities that STEM disciplines have to offer.

Isabelle Rouxel, Germany

""I coordinate the testing activities for Airbus' eVTOL prototype, CityAirbus NextGen. When I was a kid, I would always look up in the sky to try and find flying aircraft. I wanted to pilot them. Growing up, I understood that building them was as equally exciting, as you can directly influence the rotorcraft's design and capabilities. Being a part of the CityAirbus NextGen project is an opportunity to shape the future of vertical flight through innovation and decarbonisation. I'm thrilled to see our entire team coming together everyday to do just that.""

Maria Jesus Ruano, Spain

""I've been with Airbus for 11 years, the first 5 years as a Workshop Support Engineer in the Tiger Final Assembly Line and the last 6 years in Main Components Assembly. I’m currently an AET (agent d'étude de travail) for the H160 rear fuse in Albacete.

I'm responsible for the Non Conformity Board of the H160. In this role, I act as an interface with France as I oversee the end-to-end process for all the non-conformity openings that affect the rear module of the helicopter. Until the module is delivered to France, we monitor all elements affecting the helicopter’s rear fuselage, both productively and in terms of non-conformity, station to station in the FAL and the flight line. My team and I are the main technical support of the workshop for any problem that interferes with the production process.

I feel deeply proud to be a part of the great H160 family. Each delivery of an H160 is a collective achievement. Every day is a different challenge for us and it is really gratifying to know that, ultimately, we contribute to the success of the program. The success of this helicopter is also our success.""

My best advice to a young woman looking to join a career in aviation is to be constant in her efforts and determination, and to never give up. Our dreams are our future reality.

Vanessa Durant, France

""As the Super Puma FAL supervisor, I manage production and quality management for the H215, H225, H215M, and H225M helicopters and work with employees from all support professions. The diversity of my role means that every day is different, and the challenges are diverse, but I take great pride in helping to resolve issues that ensure the smooth operation and quality of our products.""

Esther Beckett, USA

""I’m originally from France and currently work as an instructor pilot for Airbus Helicopters in North America. I work primarily in ground and flight instruction, both in live aircraft and simulator, and specialise in the H125, H130 and H145 helicopters.

As a pilot for over ten years, I have flown and provided flight instruction in the US, Canada and Europe. Before becoming a pilot, I worked as an interpreter in English, Italian and French. I was introduced to helicopters while working as an interpreter for a helicopter manufacturer, which inspired me to attend flight school. In addition to my pilot's licence, I have a master's degree in humanities and social sciences in a foreign language.""

Natalia Fedortchenko, France

""I am currently working as a materials and processes engineer in the field of coatings and organic protections at Airbus Helicopters, in the Centre of Excellence for dynamic composite parts at the Paris Le-Bourget site in France.

My journey at Airbus Helicopters started as an engineering apprentice, focusing on chemistry and processes. I continued my development as a coatings specialist for the helicopter airframe in Marignane and then moved on to helicopter blades, as part of the Paris Le-Bourget team. My role is to screen, qualify and industrialise coating products to enable their use on helicopters. A material or process qualification relies on a comprehensive set of tests to achieve the highest level of safety when using coating materials. What I really appreciate in my daily job is that there is no routine. I alternate between moments at my desk, in production or in the lab to provide customer and production support, perform tests and bring expertise when needed. But what convinces me to go the extra-mile is the opportunity to work with people from various horizons, to be close to the products and to learn every day.

Recently, I contributed to the implementation of an innovative painting process during the production phase. It was a great opportunity to cooperate with other departments, listen to different points of view and collectively work toward continuous improvement of our daily processes.

I am very proud to contribute with my work and my technical expertise to all the incredible missions that our helicopters are achieving!""

If I could share some advice to all the women and girls: there are no limits to fulfil your dreams, no matter how big they are, and to do the job that makes you happy! It is all about passion, work and determination!

Sayo Nishigaki, Japan

""I started working at Airbus Helicopters Japan as an airworthiness engineer just after completing my studies. My role involves demonstrating to the authorities that a product satisfies technical requirements by analysis, tests, and other means, and therefore is in safe conditions. We work together with Airbus Helicopters for aircraft type certifications in Japan such as H160, and we in Japan also do our own customisations for Japanese and regional customers. I like this job because it deals with technical aspects for some parts and an overview of the whole product at the same time. Working on the H160 in particular is exciting - it’s a brand new helicopter full of new technologies and its certification was a great milestone to contribute to.

I am fascinated by our products - and for two reasons. The first is that they are so technically complex that they require the commitment of multiple teams and I’m thrilled to be part of this collective effort everyday. The second is that our products support customers in a range of various and tough operations. I am so inspired that we make these missions possible thanks to our teamwork!

If I had any advice to give it would be to not hinder yourself. It is easy to doubt yourself and start creating barriers in your own career out of fear. It was exactly the case for me. Thanks to the opportunity of mentoring and leadership training at Airbus, and also through everyday work with colleagues, I gradually realised that it was only my internal voice but nobody else that kept telling me I was not enough. I learned to believe in myself, and this way I learned to also trust that other people do their best.""

Believing in myself and others made it possible for me to achieve more. I hope my attitude also encourages others to do the same along the way.

Learn more about programmes at that help foster diversity within the Company and encourage women to thrive within the workplace:

Airbus is committed to advancing gender balance across the range of activities that help us make our customers’ essential missions possible. In contributing to this objective, the Company strives to provide employees with the tools and programmes that will enable them to thrive in their working environment. From transitioning back into work after becoming a parent with “Fly Again” in India, to developing local mentorship opportunities and setting targets for women’s career development opportunities, Airbus has created strong support networks that are key to reducing gender inequalities in the workplace.

In addition to providing these resources for employees, Airbus also extends its outreach to local communities by encouraging them to learn more about the adventures they could embark on within the aviation industry. Thanks to partnerships with organisations that share this goal, such as Elles Bougent in France or the STEM Club in Germany, and its participation in dedicated events around the globe, including the Women in Aviation Conference in the US, the Semaine de l’Industrie in France and Girls’ Day Akademie in Germany, Airbus seeks to reach out to more young people thinking about pursuing a career in aviation.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9625170230865479}",positive,0.9625170230865479,1

Putting out fires with Precision - Airbus,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAyLXB1dHRpbmctb3V0LWZpcmVzLXdpdGgtcHJlY2lzaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Super Puma has proved itself as an optimal fire mitigation support worldwide. However, despite having fought fires in notable hotspots such as Canada, Chile, France and Greece it has been slightly less present at United States wildfires – though according to US based operator, Precision, that could be about to change. Matt Parker, Precision’s Unmanned Business President and Ty Burlingham, Precision’s Helicopter Unit Chief Pilot tell Airbus Helicopters why American firefighters are starting to take notice of the H215.

“If they want us there, we can get there,” explains Burlingham, when asked about the places Precision operates. “Wherever we’re needed, we will go. We operate all over the US for fire mitigation. What really showcased the abilities of the aircraft was when we ended up down in Chile for the fire season. In South America you see a lot more Super Pumas on rotation and ours probably flew around 205 hours in about 45 days.”

Fire proved

With a mixed fleet that includes several Airbus helicopters, ranging from the H125 to the H215, Precision has deep experience of vertical lift solutions. The company’s ethos of operating wherever they are needed is not merely limited to their fire mitigation activities. Deploying their assets and expertise across a huge variety of missions - from providing surveillance of protected wildlife and natural environments, to supporting special military operations - their business depends on matching the right tool, to the right operation. With the Super Puma’s capacity to hold up to 18 firefighters and capability of deploying 24 cycles or trips of a 4,000 litre / 1,000 gallon bucket, in two hours, it certainly offers invaluable support. Each firefighting asset has an important role in the entire mission but none has the ability to put precise water drops with as many cycles per hour as that of the helicopter.

Precision’s multi-mission business model also means they know what they’re talking about regarding the effectiveness of certain helicopters when performing certain missions, so when they’re as effusive in their praise of the H215, their opinion, like the helicopter itself, carries a lot of weight. “The [US] Forest Service really fell in love with the helicopter,” says Parker, explaining that the Super Puma is seriously bolstering its reputation in the country. “Its speed, range, fuel load and the fact that we carry a thousand gallon bucket. All the fire agencies I talked to are super excited to have that capability. On a fire, they [the H215s] get used a lot. Sometimes you get to a fire and you’re not the first one that gets called up but with the Super Puma, when it’s on the fire, it’s constantly working”.

Burlingham agrees: “For sure. We’re the kid at school with the new toy and everybody wants to see it. Firefighters constantly ask questions when we’re overhead saying ‘what is that thing?’ and want to know how big the bucket is. They ask us how long we can be on station and when other similarly sized helicopters answer back with two hours and we respond with three and half hours on station – they’re very impressed with how long we can support them.” Despite a proven track record spanning many decades of operations, the Super Puma continues to win new admirers every time it flies.

A little drone with a big Flex…

Another tool Precision deploys to support fire mitigation operations is the Flexrotor, a tactical unmanned aerial system (UAS). Having begun using the Flexrotor for conservation and anti-poaching reconnaissance in 2016, Precision quickly understood that it possessed some impressive technology for a VTOL weighing a mere 25kg / 55lbs, which elevated it above other rival UAS. “It’s a testament to [Aerovel co-founder and Chief Technology Officer] Tad McGeer’s engineering, that it clocked up 1000 flight hours on one of its first missions. Normally you have to replace the UAS, or key components, after about 250 to 300 hours. The fact that it’s a tail sitting VTOL means the sensors last a lot longer and it offers the ability to operate in confined spaces others cannot. It’s incredibly durable.”

Precision realised that, with some tweaking, it could be applied to a range of missions. “Our business is dictated by reliability and resolution,” states Parker. “If you have the highest resolution camera on the most reliable aircraft, you’re going to stay in business. That’s what the Flexrotor represented to us.” They began collaborating with Tad McGeer’s team to upgrade the camera to the best available, increased the secondary payload by a kilo and a half and ensured it could be assembled simply, with no tools required.



Operationally, the Flexrotor can fly for more than 12 hours on firefighting missions, “which is three to four more than a manned asset could fly” points out Burlingham. “And it can fly in the evening when the helicopter is on the ground”. The UAS can be dynamically tasked, or its trajectory plotted with set waypoints and preprogrammed to fly a set orbit around a map. “Or you can fly it using the camera, with given parameters of altitude and speed,” explains Parker. “It’s incredibly easy to use and it only needs two people as crew for a wildfire.” It provides firefighters with the most up-to-date information, which is naturally invaluable in such an urgent situation. Firefighters can look at the live footage that’s being streamed and check the progress of their work and be better placed to identify where the fire is or will move to – even on occasion showing that a fire previously thought to be extinguished was still active – allowing them to optimise their movements, in the most urgent of situations.

According to Parker, the next steps are to have Flexrotor and Super Puma operating on the same fire. “I’m not sure it’s happened yet,” he notes. “But there would definitely be advantages.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997602105140686}",neutral,0.9997602105140686,0

“We are indeed in a quite more short-term and very aggressive competition with our competitor, and we wanted to take benefit of the current periods,” CEO Guillaume Faury said. His company is expecting to deliver 800 commercial aircraft this year, up from last year’s 735.

While Boeing has had to cap production on its next-generation 737 Max planes amid heightened US government scrutiny, Airbus is expecting to ramp up production. Because the companies are the two biggest names in town when it comes to aviation, the misfortunes of one can quickly become the fortunes of the other.

Paris, February 21, 2024 – Airbus and TotalEnergies have signed a strategic partnership to meet the challenges of aviation decarbonization with sustainable aviation fuel.

In line with the objective of achieving net carbon neutrality of aviation by 2050, this partnership aims to contribute to the reduction of the sector's CO 2 emissions, in which Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) play a key role. SAF supplied by TotalEnergies can reduce up to 90% CO 2 emissions over lifecycle compared to their fossil fuel equivalent.

The partnership will cover two main areas:

TotalEnergies will supply Airbus with sustainable aviation fuel for more than half of its needs in Europe.

for more than half of its needs in Europe. A research and innovation programme aimed at developing 100% sustainable fuels, tailored to the design of current and future aircraft. The impact of the composition of sustainable aviation fuels on the reduction of CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 effects, such as contrails, will also be studied.

Airbus and TotalEnergies confirm their common ambition to promote SAF technology and to strengthen their collaboration to decarbonize the aviation industry:

TotalEnergies has been supplying the SAF used by Airbus for its aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016.

TotalEnergies also supplied the fuel for several first SAF flights with Airbus aircraft: In May 2021 , the 1 st long-haul flight using French-produced SAF with an A350 between Paris and Montreal. In November 2021 ,the first flight of a H225 helicopter, from the ""Super Puma"" family, using 100% SAF. In March 2023 , the first A321neo flight with 100% SAF.



Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, said: ""The development of sustainable aviation fuels is at the heart of our Company's transition strategy. We are happy to form a strategic alliance with Airbus to play our part in meeting the challenge of aviation decarbonization together. TotalEnergies has been working hard to respond to the sector’s new demand for a reduced carbon footprint. Our Company has set itself a target of 1.5 million tons of annual SAF production by 2030.”

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said: ""Accelerating the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels is essential if we are to meet our targets for reducing carbon emissions from aviation by 2030. This partnership between Airbus and TotalEnergies demonstrates the willingness of aerospace manufacturers and major energy producers and suppliers to work together to meet this challenge. We are determined to meet our decarbonization targets and ensure that aviation can continue to play its valuable role for society in the future.""

The commercial planemaker is benefitting from a surge in orders, accumulating cash reserves compared to rival Boeing facing debt issues.

Shares were slightly lower due to cautious financial forecasts for 2024 and a lack of updates on a broader share buyback.

Europe's Airbus unveiled a special dividend on Thursday after posting higher 2023 results, buoyed by resurgent demand for jetliners and despite a fresh charge of $215 million at its troubled Space business.

The world's largest commercial planemaker said core adjusted operating profit rose 4% to 5.8 billion euros as revenue climbed 11% to 65.4 billion, and predicted core profit of 6.5 to 7.0 billion euros in 2024.

For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings came in just below market forecasts compiled by the company at 2.21 billion euros.

UNITED AIRLINES TALKS WITH BOEING COMPETITOR AIRBUS ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF BUYING MORE JETS: REPORT

Airbus is riding a wave of orders from airlines coping with a rebound in travel demand from the pandemic, helping it to build up cash reserves in contrast with U.S. rival Boeing which is mired in debts stemming from a series of crises.

Airbus proposed an unchanged regular dividend of 1.8 euros a share, and added a special dividend of 1 euro per share as net cash topped the 10-billion-euro threshold previously identified as a potential trigger for returning more cash to shareholders.

Shares were fractionally lower in early trading, however, with some analysts pointing to cautious financial forecasts for 2024 and a lack of fresh updates on a broader share buyback.

Investors have been pushing Airbus for a buyback as it extends a lead over Boeing in the single-aisle jet market.

Chief Financial Officer Thomas Toepfer said Airbus had chosen the special dividend to act quickly and to signal that it was sticking to its pledges on distributing cash.

Airbus forecast around 800 jet deliveries for 2024 but announced a further delay in entry to service of its A321XLR single-aisle jet to the third quarter from the second. The first customer airplane entered final assembly in December.

The company's forecasts are subject to no further disruption to tight global supply chains or the world economy.

Some analysts found the outlook cautious, even though Airbus and others continue to wrestle with supply constraints.

""We had seen 800 (deliveries) as the floor that investors were looking for, and had also expected 7 billion euros as the EBIT guide,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.

PRODUCTION TARGET

The Space unit charge brings the total written off in that segment last year to 600 million euros and comes a day after Reuters reported that CEO Guillaume Faury had told staff that large, unexpected charges in the business were ""not acceptable"".

The charges helped push divisional Defence and Space profits down 40% to 229 million euros while Helicopters rose 15%.

EMIRATES BUYS 15 AIRBUS JETS IN REPRIEVE FROM ENGINE ROW

Airbus is among European companies facing fierce competition from U.S. launchers and a new generation of low-cost satellites.

Faury, however, told staff in a letter last month that Airbus is better off with a high-performing Defence and Space business than without a presence in those areas.

On Thursday, he said Airbus would continue to monitor its exposure in Space.

Faury also said Airbus was ""on our plan"" to reach a key production target of 75 single-aisle jets a month in 2026 and that he remained confident in the goal, which is central to Airbus' industrial plans in the busiest part of the market.

Some suppliers remain more conservative, however, telling Reuters that Airbus is producing around 50 of the jets a month compared to a production plan that had foreseen 58 by end-2023.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9842519164085388}",positive,0.9842519164085388,1

Safety Innovation #12: Aircraft Autonomous Distress Tracking - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0LTAyLXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTEyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtZGlzdHJlc3MtdHJhY2tpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification last year, Airbus introduced a new-generation Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) device with Autonomous Distress Tracking capability (ADT) – referred to as “ELT-DT” – on its commercial aircraft. This new feature is designed to ensure that an aircraft does not become lost while in a distress situation.

The ELT’s new ADT function automatically broadcasts the aircraft’s location and other parameters every minute via a dedicated satellite network to the operator and to search-and-rescue (SAR) services, allowing them to target rescue and recovery activities. For example, if the aircraft’s last presumed location was in the sea, the ELT would broadcast the aircraft’s final impact location as well as the 3D position of the aircraft during the events leading up to it.

Airbus ADT equipment solution overview

ICAO mandate for Global Aeronautical Distress & Safety System

The industry push for the ADT adoption gathered momentum in 2017 when the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) issued a worldwide mandate called “Global Aeronautical Distress & Safety System” (GADSS). This mandate requires all new-build commercial aircraft over a certain weight (27 metric tonnes / 60,000lbs) to incorporate various new capabilities including ADT. It also includes measures for locating or ‘localising’ an aircraft wreckage ‘post-flight’ and measures for enhancing data recoverability from the aircraft.

In July 2022, ICAO extended the deadline for compliance for integrating the ADT component of GADSS, including the one-minute distress signal, to the 1st January 2025. This would apply to new delivered aircraft that have been certified for airworthiness on or after 1st January 2024.

Operation of ELT and ADFR in GADSS

Airbus develops ELT-DT solution with Safran Electronics & Defense Beacons

“For the ADT aspect of GADSS, as Airbus we chose Safran Electronics & Defense Beacons, formerly Orolia, to develop its ELT-DT solution while we would complement it with an algorithm hosted in our aircraft’s avionics computers,” recalls Claude Pichavant, Airbus’ Executive Expert for Communication, Navigation and Surveillance.

He adds: “Since the AF447 and the MH370 events, we worked together with ICAO, EASA, AEEC*, RTCA*, and in EUROCAE*, which helped to ensure that the best standardised solution would be fitted on our aircraft.”

New two-phase approach – including an autonomous distress signal every minute

As Europe’s National Aviation Authority, EASA requires that each aircraft operating in European airspace should include a means for tracking in a two-phase approach: First, during normal flight by automatically reporting the aircraft’s position at least every 15 minutes – which has been adopted by airlines since 2018.

The second phase – specifically the ADT element – is aircraft tracking during a “distress” event whilst airborne. Here the ELT-DT should activate within five seconds of detecting a confirmed distress condition, and to begin transmitting the aircraft’s position to the dedicated satellite network and then repeat transmission of that information at an increased rate of every minute.

Autonomous Distress Tracking - stages

“The one minute interval is equivalent to a six nautical mile radius from the impact site or research area,” explains Claude. He adds: “This was debated during discussions with ICAO on the standardisation and mandates. Using data from more than 50 incidents from the French accident investigation board, the Bureau Enquête et Analyses (BEA), it was agreed that the one-minute requirement is sufficient.”

Fully autonomous advantages

A big differentiator between the new ELT-DT versus previous architectures is that the device is autonomous in operation: it is self-powered by its own battery. Once it is triggered (e.g., by a signal from the aircraft’s cockpit avionics) it cannot be switched off, and it also contains a GPS receiver to broadcast the aircraft’s real-time position and altitude to Cospas/Sarsat satellites totally independently of the aircraft’s own navigation systems. Moreover, if the ELT-DT cannot communicate with the rest of the aircraft for any reason, then the ELT will self-initiate its emergency broadcasting GPS position and altitude.

Airbus pressing ahead with ELT-DT implementation

Airbus, having already obtained in 2023 the necessary EASA certification for its solution to satisfy ICAO’s GADSS mandate and EASA’s requirements, began installing the ELT-DT systems into its aircraft families. This phase kicked off with the installation into all A330neos produced, starting in April 2023.

Airbus’ other commercial aircraft programmes commenced with line-fit installations in parallel: The A350 from the end of May and the A320 and A220 Families received EASA certification for the ELT-DT during the summer of 2023 as planned. Whereas all newly-built Airbus Widebody aircraft (i.e. A330neos and A350s) receive the ELT-DT capability as standard, for the Single-Aisle Family, the new ELT-DT is being offered as a customer-selectable option – based on their planned use of the aircraft. At the time of writing, more than 110 Airbus aircraft had been delivered with the technology.

The Airbus A340 airplane was built to rule long-haul travel. Now it’s vanishing from the skies - CNN,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3RoZS1hMzQwL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSASdodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvdGhlLWEzNDA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

While the A380 superjumbo is enjoying a steady resurgence after having been on the brink of retirement during the pandemic, its older sibling – another four-engined aircraft from Airbus – seems dangerously close to being grounded for good.

The A340 was introduced 30 years ago with Lufthansa and Air France, but only 380 have been produced since, the last in 2012. By comparison, Airbus has already made 565 of its successor, the A350, since its introduction in 2015.

Despite the lackluster commercial response, Airbus had high hopes for the A340, which was meant to replace aging Boeing 747s and DC-10s, and was touted as having an unbeatable range.

Just after entering commercial service, in 1993, an A340 set records by flying from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, in New Zealand, and then back after a five-hour layover, totaling over 42 hours in the air. It was the first-ever nonstop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest-ever nonstop flight by an airliner.

In its heyday, the plane was used to operate the longest nonstop scheduled flight in the world, and was for a while the aircraft of choice for heads of state around the world due to its range and size.

But its main characteristic – the four engines – soon became a drag as fuel costs started rising and twin-engine jets began offering the same performance with lower operating costs.

By the early 2000s, the A340’s main competitor — the twin-engined Boeing 777 — was outselling it 10 to one. It had even taken away the longest flight record, with a nonstop journey from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur in 1997.

“The A340 disappeared essentially because twinjets could fulfill its mission more efficiently,” says Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues.

“There’s a reason complex organisms evolved to have no more than two of any large, energy-guzzling organ: because when you can’t get away with one, two offers the best bang for the buck. Three or more is overkill.”

There are currently just 64 A340s in service with 17 airlines globally, according to data provided to CNN by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

That’s about half as many as were in service before the pandemic, in early 2019. Only Lufthansa is operating more than 10, with many leading airlines having abandoned the type completely, like Air France, Iberia, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, all of which used to operate substantial fleets.

A worrying sign of the A340’s imminent demise is that there are currently no airlines operating the A340-500 variant, which Airbus introduced in 2003 as the world’s longest-range commercial airliner.

Between 2004 and 2013, the -500 variant was used by Singapore Airlines to operate the world’s longest flight, from Newark to Singapore. “The route was discontinued because Singapore Airlines couldn’t generate enough revenue to offset the cost, particularly with fuel,” says Crichlow.

One of the main factors driving four-engine jets to extinction is that newer and more reliable twin-engined jets, like the 787 and the A350, have progressively obtained better safety ratings that allowed them to fly for longer in case of loss of power from one of the two engines.

Previously, four-engined jets had an advantage in this area.

“Clearly, shutting down one engine on a twinjet is a bigger deal than shutting down one on a quadjet,” says Crichlow. “But starting in the late 1990s with the introduction of the Boeing 777, up to three hours of single-engine flight time was allowed for eligible operators.

“Today, the certification record is for the Airbus A350 with up to 370 minutes, or about 2,500 nautical miles. With the kind of routing flexibility that certification offers, airlines who want to service far-flung city pairs simply don’t need four engines anymore.”

As a result, only eight A340-500s are left out of the 34 built. Only two of those are still in a passenger layout, with Azerbaijan Airlines, and they’ve been parked since November 2022 and March 2023 respectively, Crichlow adds.

Of the remaining six, five are in use by governments and one is outfitted for corporate and VIP flights.

Rare beauty

Sam Chui, an aviation enthusiast and blogger who has flown on the A340 over 50 times, remembers being on board the Newark to Singapore flight when it was the longest in the world.

“That flight lasted around 19 hours on average,” Chui says. Initially, Singapore operated it in a traditional two-class configuration, but in the final years it changed things up.

“They moved to an all-business class - 100 seats only, on a very large airplane that typically can fit 300 airplane seats. It was a fairly quiet cabin.”

Passengers liked the plane, but it wasn’t without problems.

“On a long flight from Hong Kong to London on the A340-300, they would often leave a lot of baggage behind when the plane was full,” Chui adds. “The Singapore flight took a long time to take off in the US – three-quarters of the full runway.”

Oddly enough for a passenger aircraft, the A340 was believed to be somewhat underpowered and acquired a reputation of being slow.

“It was the only plane to be hit by bird strikes from behind,” jokes Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisor.

“The original A340 was slow, fuel-thirsty, and, thanks to having four engines, both heavy and costly to maintain. The stretched and re-engined variants weren’t much better and by the time they were launched, it was very clear that twin-engine jets could do anything quads could do, at lower cost and with less maintenance.”

Without any cargo version – which usually prolongs the lifespan of an aircraft, as in the case of the Boeing 747 – it’s likely that the A340 will disappear from the skies entirely within a decade or two.

For now, however, the type still has some life left in it, and is even flying to one of the world’s most challenging destinations, Antarctica: Charter airline HiFly is operating flights to the region with an A340-300, carrying scientists and a small group of tourists.

Many will miss it when it’s gone.

“The A340 is, almost inarguably, the prettiest of all the Airbus jets, and I’m sad to see fewer and fewer of them around,” says Patrick Smith, an airline pilot flying Boeing aircraft and the author of the popular book and blog “Ask the Pilot.”

“In an age of boring aesthetic sameness among commercial jets, it has always set itself apart,” he adds.

“My favorite A340 variant is the -600, with the stretched fuselage and the huge Rolls-Royce engines. What a beauty. I once took an extra-early departure out of Bangkok just for the opportunity to fly on the -600.”

As its numbers dwindle, the A340 will increasingly turn into a planespotter’s favorite.

“It’s an exciting airplane to watch, especially when it takes off at the very last minute,” says Chui.

“These are now very rare, and that makes them more interesting for aviation enthusiasts. Certainly something different compared to twin-engine aircraft.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5680751800537109}",positive,0.5680751800537109,1

Speaking to Vertical on the eve of HAI Heli-Expo 2024 in Anaheim, California, Bart Reijnen, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region for the manufacturer, said the decision was driven by the scale of demand for the type.

“It has been a record year for the 145 globally — and for North America, you could say every second booking we made last year was for a twin engine aircraft [H135 or H145],” he said.

“Now we start ramping up production for commercial deliveries to U.S. customers and that’s a further step in terms of increasing our footprint in the U.S., but also increasing proximity to our customers in North America.”

The facility in Colombus is already home to a FAL for the H125 AStar, and was the production site of 480 UH-72 Lakotas — the military version of the EC145 produced for the U.S. Army.

Reijnen said the H145 production stations have required a little reorganization and some tweaks to the process from the Lakota, “but in general, it’s the same setup.”

The production line capabilities will also mirror those of the existing — and main — H145 FAL in Donauworth, Germany, with aircraft tailored for air medical, law enforcement, VIP, or utility operations.

“That is an important statement, because it also demonstrates that the corporate sites in Europe have really understood the knowledge, the competences, the credibility of what the Mississippi team has been setting up over the past two decades,” said Reijnen.

“This is of course built on very strong trust between the European team and the U.S. team that we are able to do this.”

Many of the workers who previously worked on Lakota production — and have subsequently moved to other areas — will be returning to the H145 FAL for commercial production, he said.

The company is currently targeting a production rate of 16 H145s a year in Columbus, and hopes to hit that figure by 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9969428181648254}",neutral,0.9969428181648254,0

With the new order of ten additional H145s, we continue to ensure the optimal service for our patients by keeping the helicopter fleet as modern and flexible as possible for our life-saving missions,” said Dr. Krystian Pracz, CEO of DRF Luftrettung.

""As an operator that deploys its fleet for emergency medical services, the DRF Luftrettung truly understands the importance that a helicopter's performance can have in making a decisive difference in the care a patient receives. We are therefore very grateful for the continued trust that they place in our helicopters,"" said Thomas Hein, Head of Europe Region at Airbus Helicopters. ""We are proud to see that over the last decade the H145 has become the backbone of DRF Luftrettung's fleet performing life-saving missions in Germany and Europe.""

The ordered helicopters will also be covered by DRF’s fleet-wide HCare Smart contract, which provides comprehensive parts-by-the-hour support.

DRF Luftrettung is one of the largest and most experienced air rescue organisations in Europe. The organisation and its subsidiaries operate more than 50 Airbus H135 and H145 helicopters at 40 bases throughout Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland for emergency rescue and intensive care transport operations. In addition to this, they are also deployed for special missions, including hoist operations and day and night operations.

The new version of Airbus’ best-selling H145 adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 150 kg. The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design eases maintenance operations, improving the serviceability benchmark and reliability of the H145, while improving flight comfort for both passengers and crew.

In total, there are more than 1,675 H145 family helicopters in service, logging a total of more than 7.6 million flight hours. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with a full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class, while its CO2 emissions are the lowest amongst its competitors.

Airbus: H225 could still have offshore role - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWgyMjUtY291bGQtc3RpbGwtaGF2ZS1vZmZzaG9yZS1yb2xlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters expects to deliver more than 100 of its H225 Super Pumas over the next five years — and believes the heavy-lift type will have a role to play in the offshore industry in the future.

The Super Puma largely exited the offshore industry following the crash of a CHC-operated H225 near Turoy, Norway, in 2016, which was caused by a main gearbox failure. At the same time, the oil-and-gas industry began a prolonged downturn that led to overcapacity of heavy-lift aircraft serving the market — and aircraft parked around the world.

Now, the offshore industry has returned to strength and that overcapacity has been absorbed. That, together, with the struggle some operators are having in supporting the Sikorsky S-92 — the other commercial heavy-lift transport helicopter in service — is leading to a boom in demand.

Speaking to journalists during a pre-Heli-Expo briefing at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France, Regis Magnac, head of the company’s energy segment, said super medium helicopters (the Airbus H175 and Leonardo AW189) have taken a chunk of this market — but that heavy-lift aircraft still present a unique capability.

“There are areas of the world where long, long distance flights — potentially with de-icing and [other capabilities] — are still needed, and there will be a need for replacement of the heavies flying there,” he said.

“This is where the 225 will come into play, because we believe that [with] its range capacities, de-icing capacity, [and] its cabin size can be a replacement for those needs — and can be the only replacement for those needs.”

Magnac said Airbus has been “in conversation with people who are interested in [the 225]” — and has even hosted delegations of unions from Norway. Much of the conversations are based around discussing the work that Airbus has been doing to further enhance the safety of the type beyond the solution that allowed it to return to service in 2016.

“We did not communicate to the oil-and-gas market for a long time, but now they are coming and asking questions,” said Michel Macia, head of the H225 program. “I think [it’s true] that, in particular in Norway, there is a lot of perception [about the H225’s safety] . . . but I think that perception is changing.”

Still, the company does not anticipate that potential interest resulting in new offshore orders in the near-term. Airbus’s five-year H225 delivery forecast doesn’t take into account deliveries into the offshore sector — the company believes its broader return to that work will likely be beyond 2028.

Instead, the figure represents a continuation of the same demand for Super Pumas from other sectors — military and parapublic/government support — that has seen Airbus deliver 100 of the type over the last five years.

Before 2016, 80 percent of Super Pumas around the world were working in the offshore sector. Today an estimated 20 of the global H225 fleet of 350 aircraft are still working in oil-and-gas — largely in China, but also in Brazil and Africa.

“In 2017, we disappeared completely from the oil-and-gas market — not only us, for heavy aircraft this market disappeared almost completely,” said Macia. “Nevertheless, we survived, because we delivered 100 aircraft for different markets, which mean that this particular product is really a multirole/mission [aircraft].”

The type has entered the utility market with great success, with a fleet of 50 aircraft working in this role in North America alone. Texas-based Air Center Helicopters has become perhaps the highest-profile customer for the type in the multimission role, using it for military support contracts and firefighting, among other tasks.

Macia said the H225’s ability to carry 4 tonnes of water — and then also be able to carry people (unlike non-commercially certified aircraft) — made it an ideal firefighting aircraft.

Airbus is aware that a key element of securing the type’s potential return to widescale offshore work is convincing potential customers that the H225 is a safe aircraft.

Last year, Airbus introduced an enhanced main gearbox (eMGB) for the H225. Standard on all new-build Super Pumas, it is also being retrofitted on the existing fleet as gearboxes come in for overhaul.

As well as simplifying maintenance, the eMGB further improves safety, Macia said.

“In 2016, we took lot of measures to make the aircraft fly again with a safe condition,” he explained. “What happened in 2016 is something we were not expecting … so what we thought at that time is we need to be robust also to any event we don’t [anticipate].”

The team looked at all the safety barriers in place to protect against various events — and has added additional safety barriers each time they felt further layers were required.

“When we viewed the complete main gearbox with each of the different functions . . . each time the level of risk was at the level where we think the safety barriers were not at the right level, we [have] enhanced the safety barriers,” said Macia.

Product support has also been a major investment, with the manufacturer working to simplify the aircraft’s maintenance plan — aiming to push most tasks beyond 1,000 flight hours — and reducing the amount of time required to complete it.

In consultation with operators, Airbus also identified 250 “critical tasks” in maintenance where operators believed there was a risk that task might not be completed correctly — whether due to the complexity of the task or external conditions. The company has been working through that list of tasks, addressing them through modifying documentation, digitalizing documentation, producing videos, adding warnings, producing new documentation, or redesigning parts. Macia said the company is now about 60 percent of the way through the list.

In the cockpit, new avionics provide enlarged displays with a simplified pilot interface, while a cockpit and tail boom camera will help provide enhanced situational awareness.

Future changes will include upgrades to the aircraft’s navigation and communications systems, Macia said, and a crash resistant fuel system is in development.

The company is also working to improve the industrial process to enable quicker reactivity for customers who need an aircraft with a short lead-time, or who have “complex, tailor-made” requirements.

A fully digitized version of the aircraft is speeding up the customization process, and the manufacturer has the ability to 3D print prototype parts to rapidly check the fit and any quality issues.

Despite a lack of any orders for the type in 2023, Airbus firmly believes the H225’s success as a multirole aircraft will ensure its future for decades to come.

“What we want is this aircraft to be in the fleet beyond 2040,” said Macia. “We are not investing for one year or 10 years, we’re investing for the next 30, 40 years. So, we believe in the market — and we believe in this market because this aircraft is sustainable.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9490314722061157}",neutral,0.9490314722061157,0
Airbus battling supply chain to ramp H160 production to meet demand - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWJhdHRsaW5nLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi10by1yYW1wLWgxNjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi10by1tZWV0LWRlbWFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Supply chain issues continue to constrain Airbus Helicopters’ ability to ramp up to meet the demand for its new medium H160, with the airframer currently working through a backlog of 110 orders for the type.

Airbus secured orders for 26 H160s in 2023, and delivered 20. There are now 25 H160s in service — including four that are with U.S. operator PHI in preparation for the start of a “route proving” program — and the type has recorded 4,000 flight hours across its global fleet.

Gilles Armstrong, head of the H160 program at Airbus Helicopters, said the company was targeting a production rate of 40 per year, and it hoped to hit that “as soon as we can.”

“There’s this big backlog to deliver; we want to get there and deliver that as soon as possible,” he told journalists during a pre-Heli-Expo briefing at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France. “[The H160] is very popular, and so from a product placement in the market point of view, our only limit today is what we can produce.”

The final assembly line has grown to accommodate the ramp-up, but Armstrong said the limiting factor is the supply chain.

“It’s about the classic action plans around that,” he said. “Making sure there’s the right capacity in the right places, and working through each individual issue.”

He said he hoped to hit the 40-aircraft-per-year target in 2026.

Armstrong said increasing the number of flight hours has been a key element for the program team over the last year, along with its entry into operations in new regions and in new configurations.

These include the first delivery of an ACH160 Exclusive, with VIP orders also coming from Saudi Arabia’s The Helicopter Company (THC), Air Corporate in Italy, and two customers in India.

Armstrong said he wasn’t surprised by the type’s immediate success in the business/corporate segment — which he said is part of a wider trend of growth in that segment across the manufacturer’s range.

A law enforcement-configured H160 began flight tests last year, and Armstrong said the aircraft was about “three quarters” of the way through the flight test program. The first customer for these will be the Gendarmerie Nationale — the French national police.

“Because of all these different equipment certifications and international markets, it’s a very active period in terms of product development, product certification, and entry-into-service,” said Armstrong.

Looking ahead, he said 2024 would see a faster acceleration in the global fleet’s flight hours, with the entry-into-service with offshore operator PHI a large driver behind that.

“This is going to be for us one of the big learning points of the year — to see the aircraft operating at that very high flight rate and to see whether our support system and our technical support is ready to deal with that,” said Armstrong. “We’re confident they are but the whole point is to demonstrate that through the route proving exercise.”

Meanwhile, development work is continuing on the H160M — the military version of the type. The company has started ordering components for the first prototype, which will be assembled this year.

The French armed forces will be the first customer for the type — where it will be known as the Guepard — with an initial order for 30 as part of the Light Joint Helicopter program (HIL). This requirement could rise to up to 169 aircraft.

Armstrong said Airbus has had “a lot of requests for information” on the H160M from international customers, but that it was too early in the aircraft’s development to be formalizing any interest.

“We think it’s going to be in a segment where it can be a real difference-maker compared to what exists in that medium segment,” he said. “It’s an aircraft that’s appealing in terms of its capability, both from an aircraft point of view and from a system point of view.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983900785446167}",neutral,0.9983900785446167,0
Airbus reaps reward of H125/H130 evolution with best deliveries for a decade - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJlYXBzLXJld2FyZC1vZi1oMTI1LWgxMzAtZXZvbHV0aW9uLXdpdGgtYmVzdC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWZvci1hLWRlY2FkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters recorded the largest number of deliveries of its intermediate singles for a decade in 2023, with almost 200 H130s and H125s rolling of its production lines over the year.

The company took orders for 108 H125s and 39 H130s in 2023 — figures that include a bumper contract with Italian operator Air Corporate, announced at EBACE in May, for 40 aircraft.

According to Airbus’s figures, this represented an 82 percent share of the global market for intermediate singles. Speaking at a media briefing ahead of HAI Heli-Expo 2024, Jerome Ronssin, head of light helicopters at Airbus said this was a continuation of a general trend of increased market share within the segment that was established in 2020.

“I think that the choices that we made in the past in terms of product evolution, and the sum of them combined together, really made both the H125 and H130 mission capable,” he said, explaining the increase. “This is really what the clients need. But at the same time, we were very attentive on the other features that are important — which is maintenance, keeping the cost as low as possible.”

These product evolutions include increased power, the certification of the BLR FastFin, the addition of a lightweight data recorder, upgraded avionics, the Garmin GFC 600H three-axis autopilot, ADSB-In/Out and the creation of a lean instrument panel. Ronssin said the later was proving particularly popular among utility pilots, and now represented about 10 percent of H125 sales.

On the maintenance side, inspections at 600 flight hours have now been increased to 750 flight hours, and weekly inspections moved to monthly.

“The very first thing [operators] are mentioning on the light helicopters — if you ask them what do you want in terms of improvement — is this one [reduced maintenance requirements],” said Ronssin. “They want the aircraft to fly as much as possible.”

Last year, Airbus announced the development of an instrument flight rules (IFR) version of the H125, in collaboration with Genesys Aerosystems.

The prototype of the system will be on display at Airbus Helicopters’ booth at the upcoming HAI Heli-Expo in Anaheim, California, with the company aiming for first flight in the next few weeks. Airbus is targeting certification from the Federal Aviation Administration this year.

Ronssin said the manufacturer was seeing “an increasing interest” in the capability, particularly among private pilots and air medical operators.

Brazilian certification will be next up, while European approval “might take a bit of time,” said Ronssin.

The system will be available only in new aircraft to begin with. Whether the company develops the ability to retrofit it will depend on market demand.

On the H130, Airbus has announced it is developing a new three-axis autopilot with Garmin, proposed as a supplemental type certificate (STC) and installed directly in the final assembly line (FAL). The companies are targeting certification in 2025.

“We are pretty excited [about the autopilot] because . . . the H130 is quite successful in particular on the private market, and we know that the private operators are usually fond of those types of assistance when flying,” said Ronssin.

The H125 is currently produced at three FALs: at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France; at its facility in Columbus, Mississippi; and in Itajubá, Brazil. Last month, the manufacturer announced the creation of a fourth FAL, to be located in India.

The exact position of the Indian H125 FAL is still to be determined, but Airbus is targeting 2026 for the first Indian-assembled H125 to roll off the production line. The site will be dedicated to the civil and parapublic markets.

““Fundamentally, yes, we’re doing the project to boost the market demand in India,” said Ronssin. “[But] it will also support the after-sales. . . . Whether they are private or commercial clients, they will feel more comfortable to have some after-sales industrial capabilities close to them.”

The current target is to build “at least 10” helicopters a year in India, but there is no upper limit — it will depend on market growth, he added.

The global fleet for the two types flew 1.5 million flight hours in 2023, and Airbus will celebrate 40 million flight hours for the Ecureuil fleet this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8834085464477539}",neutral,0.8834085464477539,0

According to the Associated Press, the company said in an annual earnings report February 15 that it wants to deliver 800 commercial planes in 2024, up from 735 in 2023.

“We progressed on our production ramp-up against a backdrop of an operating environment that remains complex and affected by supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts, so at the end that’s quite an achievement in my view,” said CEO Guillaume Faury.

Faury added that Airbus already has a large order backlog for A320 narrow-body jets and that new airplane orders wouldn‘t be available until 2030 at the earliest.

“What’s happening in the broader industry - you refer to the situation of the competitor [Boeing] - has obviously an impact on all of this,” Faury said.

Airbus reported that its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes grew by 4% to $6.2 billion while revenue increased by 11% year-over-year.

Airbus also said that it plans to pay shareholders a special dividend on top of the regular dividend they receive due in part to the organization’s strong balance sheet, which included a 14% rise in cash.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9987143278121948}",positive,0.9987143278121948,1

Despite already emitting significantly less noise than competing helicopters, Acoustic Expert Julien Caillet delves into the research aiming to reduce Airbus’ helicopters’ sound levels even further.

Compared to other helicopters, Airbus’ range already has a clear advantage in terms of noise emissions. Why is that?

Julien Caillet: Innovation and continuous development is at the heart of what Airbus does. Thanks to these values, our products benefit from several technologies which limit noise, such as the Fenestron, the shrouded tail rotor with its modulated blade distribution. We have innovative blade shapes which are designed to reduce noise, for example the H160, but also the H135 and H145. The noise emissions of every helicopter is publicly available and Airbus’ helicopters have a clear advantage and we will continue to study various possibilities to improve things even further.

What is behind Airbus Helicopters’ motivation to reduce the noise footprint even further?

Julien Caillet: It’s about supporting our customers, to make sure that they’re recognised as good neighbours in the communities that they’re flying in. While helicopters are often performing essential operations, they’re often flying much closer to the population than fixed-wing aircraft are. For emergency medical services missions, they could be hovering above a city, or taking-off and landing much nearer to the general public. They could also be operating in natural environments, or close to nature and wildlife. We want to support our operators by doing everything we can to ensure their noise emissions are minimal, so they are less likely to be impacted by complaints, regulations or local restrictions.

What are the key areas of focus?

Julien Caillet: Obviously one area of focus is technological innovation and of course, the technobricks we conceive will have an impact on reducing the sound footprint. However we have also directed specific research into studying the effects of how a helicopter can be specifically flown, in order to minimise the noise it emits. We have developed some tools and some experimental databases on our products to really understand all the noise that is emitted and propagated to the ground, as well as the effects of various flight conditions. The effect of speed, the effect of glide slopes, meaning climb or descent angles, the effect of turns, of all non-stationary manoeuvres. We are modelling this information so that we can predict the best operating conditions in order to reduce the noise on the ground.

It allows us to make or produce noise maps of the operation of our helicopters, providing a deep understanding of the level of noise we are producing in particular areas around the helicopter. This is really quite important because noise is not something which is visible or discernible for the pilots or crew. The second thing is, on top of being able to produce these kinds of environmental impact assessment maps, we have also developed tools to optimise these operations, optimising the trajectory of the helicopter - trajectory being the latitudinal and longitudinal position of the aircraft - its elevation, its altitude, but also the slopes, the speed, the acceleration and deceleration are taken into account in the noise reduction. We have also developed some advanced propagation models of the sound, to really compute quite accurately the noise, which is produced on the ground, meaning taking into account the distance to the aircraft, but also the atmospheric absorption, the reflections on the ground, even complex propagation effects such as building masking or reflections. We are also able to take into account wind effects or temperature gradient effects in these kinds of predictions.

This map shows a helicopter trajectory with noise contours. It allows operators to see the noise emissions of a helicopter in relation to local population density.

What has been the customer feedback?

Julien Caillet: When we present this topic to an operator showing what we are now capable of doing, they are really glad to gain an understanding of the noise which they are producing on the ground, because this is not something which is visible for them, they are not really aware of it. They are also very keen on seeing that there are flight conditions which are much noisier than others. It is not obvious, for example, that helicopter approaches are much noisier than helicopter take-offs. They do not necessarily know that on some combinations of glide slopes and speed in approach phase they are particularly noisier than in other conditions. So, trying to avoid these conditions is something that is clearly an opportunity for them to reduce their noise. They are happy to try the recommendations that we are providing to them.

This map shows local population density heatspots while plotting an optimised and non-optimised route for the helicopter.

Are there any other projects that this research will be able to support?

Julien Caillet: So, we are also actively participating in some projects to try to understand what the acceptability of noise is, to better define our next product or our next technology so that they will match these requirements. Sound levels will be important concerning the acceptance for Urban Air Mobility, like the CityAirbus NextGen aircraft. eVTOLs will fly above cities and if not properly designed could be noisy for the population, not to mention that they will also likely fly very close to the general public in crowded areas. Helicopters represent a good means to anticipate and influence the design before our eVTOL prototype takes to the skies and this research would also of course still benefit our current in-service helicopter fleet.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9985301494598389}",positive,0.9985301494598389,1
"Boeing, Airbus struggle to deliver planes as supply chain woes persist - FRANCE 24 English","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyNDAyMjMtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1zdHJ1Z2dsZS10by1kZWxpdmVyLXBsYW5lcy1hcy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4td29lcy1wZXJzaXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore (AFP) – Boeing and Airbus struck deals to sell billions of dollars' worth of planes at this week's airshow in Singapore, but supply chain disruptions mean they may struggle to deliver them on time, analysts said.

Plane makers are already behind in their current orders due to parts shortages and lack of skilled labour, as the travel sector recovers from the havoc caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

From engines and seatbelts to wiring and screws, a single plane needs millions of parts from suppliers across the world, making them vulnerable to supply chain hiccups.

Among the major deals announced at Asia's biggest airshow, which ends Sunday, was an order by Thai Airways for 45 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, while Royal Brunei Airlines bought four of the popular model.

Europe's Airbus said it secured a commitment from Vietnamese carrier Vietjet Air to purchase 20 of its A330-900 aircraft, with the first delivery due in 2026.

That might be optimistic.

Aviation analyst Shukor Yusof said Boeing and Airbus had already indicated that some of their popular models would be unavailable until 2030.

""The new orders will struggle to be delivered as continued shortages in labour and raw materials, problems in logistics as well as energy costs prevail,"" said Shukor, founder of consultancy Endau Analytics.

""Raising production rates will be very tough to achieve. You're not making hand phones.""

The delays mean airlines cannot offer more seats and will be stuck with older, less fuel-efficient planes, which may dent their profits, Shukor said.

- 'Major bottlenecks' -

Problems across the supply chain were caused largely by the pandemic when restrictions and border closures disrupted shipments of raw materials and led to layoffs of pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers and aircraft mechanics.

The war in Ukraine also interfered with oil supplies and triggered higher costs for goods and services worldwide.

As Covid-19 eased, air travel returned with a vengeance on pent-up demand, leaving manufacturers, airlines, airports and suppliers struggling to keep up.

The supply chain ""has become a major bottleneck, a major issue, holding capacity coming back into the market, aircraft delivery delays,"" said Brendan Sobie, an analyst with independent consultancy Sobie Aviation.

Parts shortages have led to planes spending more time waiting for maintenance, while engine problems have forced aircraft to be grounded, he added.

Boeing said each 787 Dreamliner needed around 2.3 million parts, with some made by the company and others sourced from suppliers worldwide, according to its website.

Airbus has thousands of direct and indirect suppliers from more than 100 countries from where it sources parts, components, systems and services, the company said on its website.

International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh told a seminar ahead of the airshow that supply chain issues were ""likely to continue for a few more years"".

Labour shortages were another problem.

Boeing said last year the industry would need 649,000 pilots, 690,000 maintenance technicians and 938,000 cabin crew members over the next 20 years ""to support the commercial fleet and meet long-term growth in air travel"".

Shukor said some airlines that let go of pilots during the pandemic were finding it hard to hire them back, while manufacturers were struggling to find highly specialised aircraft mechanics and technicians, who need time to be trained and get licenced.

Many were ""no longer interested in coming back"" to the industry because Covid proved their jobs were not secure, Shukor said.

Michael Szucs, chief executive of Philippine carrier Cebu Pacific, said his airline had been forced to ground 10 planes which may increase to 16 this year due to problems in the Pratt & Whitney engines.

The carrier was also affected by delays from Airbus.

""We've got a shortfall in capacity either through aircraft grounded or aircraft not arriving on time,"" Szucs told AFP at the airshow.

""It's just never been more difficult to keep the fleet flying.""

Hydrogen to be a potential enabler to Singapore's aviation decarbonisation - Airbus,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC0wMi1oeWRyb2dlbi10by1iZS1hLXBvdGVudGlhbC1lbmFibGVyLXRvLXNpbmdhcG9yZXMtYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 22 February 2024 - The Singapore Hydrogen Cooperation Committee sees hydrogen fuel playing a potential role in the state’s aviation decarbonisation journey.

The working group was formed following the signing of the Cooperation Agreement by Airbus, Changi Airport Group, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), and Linde in February 2022. Since then, the committee has examined regional and local market demand and supply for hydrogen, the hydrogen supply chain and infrastructure requirements, and the potential considerations for establishing a successful hydrogen ecosystem for aviation in the city-state.

The technology to use liquid hydrogen to power aircraft is currently under development and will only be applied on future generations of large commercial aircraft. The early technical feasibility study undertaken by the committee is useful to ensure that when the technology becomes mature and feasible, Singapore will be well prepared to incorporate liquid hydrogen as part of its aviation decarbonisation strategy.

“Stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly taking greater interest in making significant investments into hydrogen, developing new technologies and establishing supply chains. Together with our partners, we recognise the potential of hydrogen becoming a longer-term decarbonisation pathway for aircraft operations, complementing sustainable aviation fuel, in support of our transition towards net zero by 2050,” said Sabine Klauke, Chief Technology Officer, Airbus.

As part of the study, the committee has identified infrastructure scenarios that could support the progressive deployment of a large-scale supply of liquid hydrogen for aviation at Changi Airport in the longer term future. Singapore’s aviation sector may consume up to 50 tonnes of liquid hydrogen daily from the 2040s, and up to 600 tonnes per day beyond 2050. These scenarios are based on future hydrogen aircraft with capacities of 100 to 200 passengers, operating range of 1000 to 2000 nautical miles, entering service between 2035 and 2040 in Singapore.

While a 2,000 NM range from Singapore’s Changi Airport would allow an aircraft to reach about 74 airports in 20 Asia-Pacific countries and territories, the committee highlighted that other key factors such as the hydrogen readiness levels at potential destination airports and airlines’ commercial considerations would also be important to realise the eventual hydrogen-powered flights between Changi Airport and other airports in the region.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said, “The International Civil Aviation Organization Member States have adopted a collective long-term global aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. While the near-term focus is on the wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuels in aircraft operations, hydrogen can potentially play a complementary role as a sustainable energy fuel in the longer term. CAAS has shared some of the key findings from the study with relevant government agencies for longer-term national planning for demand of hydrogen and will continue to monitor signposts around the development of hydrogen technology for aircraft operations.”

Ms Poh Li San, Senior Vice President, Terminal 5 Specialised Systems, Changi Airport Group said, “Hydrogen technology is still in its nascency, with many uncertainties and the industry is working hard to study aspects such as operations, safety, regulation and economics. These need to be examined further. As the aviation industry progresses on its sustainability journey, it is prudent to take a phased approach as air hubs study how best to support the use of hydrogen by aircraft.”

“Hydrogen has a key role to play in the global clean energy transition. In aviation, hydrogen shows promise on two fronts: reducing aircraft emissions in the air, and decarbonising airside ground activities,” said John Panikar, EVP and CEO APAC, Linde. “Linde has over 100 years of experience with hydrogen. Our business spans the entire global hydrogen value chain and we look forward to leveraging our capabilities to further develop the promise of hydrogen in aviation.”

To enable hydrogen powered aviation to take-off when the technology, regulations, infrastructure and supply chains are ready, the committee also agreed that it was important to continue monitoring the development of hydrogen technology for aviation around the following signposts:

Technology : monitor hydrogen aircraft technology maturity and develop related signposts, including the launch of Airbus’ ZEROe aircraft demonstrator in 2027;

Concept of Operations (CONOPs) : monitor development of associated CONOPs for logistics, storage, onsite distribution and refuelling of liquid hydrogen in an airport environment;

Regulations : monitor development of safety regulatory frameworks and standards around the use of liquid hydrogen for aircraft operations;

Hydrogen Supply Chain and Airport Infrastructure : monitor development of robust and commercial-scale liquid hydrogen supply chain compatible with an airport (from import, storage, and onward distribution network to aircraft);

Readiness of other airports for liquid hydrogen aircraft operations;

Relative price of liquid hydrogen as an alternative aircraft fuel.

"Airbus, LCI Collaborate to Develop Advanced Air Mobility Ecosystems - FLYING","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWxjaS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZS10by1kZXZlbG9wLWFkdmFuY2VkLWFpci1tb2JpbGl0eS1lY29zeXN0ZW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest manufacturer of airliners is looking to build the ecosystem for an entirely new kind of aircraft.

Airbus on Tuesday announced an agreement with international helicopter and fixed-wing lessor LCI to jointly set the stage for advanced air mobility (AAM) operations of emerging aircraft, including electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis and other electric models. The collaboration will hone in on three key areas: AAM strategy, commercialization, and financing.

The partners will study AAM market perspectives and forecasts, conduct industry research, and leverage data analytics to uncover new applications and missions. They will also develop new AAM solutions, exploring the commercialization of aircraft fleets, batteries, and charging networks.

“For two decades, LCI and Airbus have delivered capacity and financing solutions to airlines and operators across the globe, and we are now extending that to advanced air mobility,” said Jaspal Jandu, CEO of LCI. “Transportation and logistical networks have a duty to be efficient, sustainable, and scalable. Both LCI and Airbus take a holistic and pragmatic view of advanced air mobility, including vehicles and also infrastructure, financing, and network adoption.”

Under the agreement, LCI will become a “key financial partner” for certain Airbus AAM projects, such as those focused on emergency medical services. The lessor will use its network to boost global adoption and acceptance of emerging aircraft. It also intends to explore leasing and finance solutions for potential buyers of the CityAirbus NextGen, Airbus’ flagship eVTOL air taxi model.

The all-electric CityAirbus NextGen is designed for a pilot to fly up to four passengers, with a 50 sm (43 nm) operational range and 75 mph (65 knots) cruise speed. The model includes fixed wings, V-shaped tail, and distributed electric propulsion system that powers eight electric propellers.

Airbus finalized assembly of the first CityAirbus NextGen model and powered on the aircraft at the end of 2023. The next phase will be a test campaign using the manufacturer’s new AAM test center in Donauwörth, Germany. Those flights represent a step toward type certification of the aircraft with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

“We are excited to extend our long-standing relationship with LCI, an innovative lessor that is globally unique in its positioning across the commercial fixed-wing, helicopter and AAM sectors,” said Balkiz Sarihan, CEO and head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus. “LCI’s combination of operational expertise, customer networks, and financial insights complements Airbus’ technical innovation in flight technologies and will enable us to collectively drive the development of advanced air mobility.”

Airbus is working with Groupe ADP, the organization that manages Paris’ international airports, and regional French authorities to fly the CityAirbus NextGen at the 2024 Olympic Games in the nation’s capital, where other manufacturers such as Germany’s Volocopter and China’s AutoFlight also intend to demonstrate their respective air taxis.

Recently, the company stepped up its partnership for the aircraft’s rollout in Italy, where it is working with ITA Airways, the country’s flag carrier, to build a nationwide AAM ecosystem. It added vertiport operator UrbanV and green energy company Enel, which will assist airports with the transition to electric infrastructure, to the partnership. Prior to the initial partnership announcement in 2022, ITA purchased 28 Airbus aircraft, leasing another 56 following the agreement.

Beyond CityAirbus, the manufacturer is developing four low-carbon ZEROe aircraft concepts, each powered by hydrogen and built to fly 100 to 200 passengers. It hopes to introduce a commercial, low-carbon aircraft by 2035 and recently partnered with four Scandinavian firms to study hydrogen infrastructure at airports in Norway and Sweden.

Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, meanwhile, launched a dedicated drone and uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) business in November, signaling its interest in self-flying electric aircraft. Airbus already produces several UAS—such as the long-range, high-flying Zephyr—but last month expanded its portfolio with the acquisition of Aerovel by Airbus Helicopters.
