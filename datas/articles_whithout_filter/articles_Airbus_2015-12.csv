Flying Upper Deck Economy on a Lufthansa Airbus A380 - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi91cHBlci1kZWNrLWVjb25vbXktb24tYS1sdWZ0aGFuc2EtYTM4MC1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXRvLWZyYW5rZnVydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Traveling from the Bay Area to Europe? Chances are you may find yourself on the Star Alliance trunk route from SFO to Frankfurt. I did recently as I kicked off a trip to Germany, India, and Southeast Asia, celebrating my final few months of freedom between a journalism job and medical school. In my experience, flying to Lufthansa’s ’œFraport’ mega-hub from San Francisco generally meant a trip on United’s venerable ’“ and noticeably aging ’“ 747-400s. While they are beautiful birds from the outside, they don’t make for the best long-haul economy class flights: no seatback screens, no power outlets (although that has since been corrected), and cramped seats, unless you can bump up to Economy Plus or better. Interested in something new, I leapt at the chance to try out Lufthansa’s A380 flight on the same route.

I was glad to be able to book the flight on United ticket stock (ticket number beginning with ’œ016’), which meant I earned both premier qualifying miles (PQMs) and dollars (PQDs) for the flight. With the current UA premier qualifying system, you earn PQMs when you book non-UA ticket stock with Star Alliance partners, but not the PQDs – which are needed for elite qualification.

Curiously, the confirmation code United provided me allowed me to manage my reservation on Lufthansa’s website, but did not work for online check-in. I found a Lufthansa-specific code buried in a separate email. A bit confusing, but not a huge deal. One downside of booking a Lufthansa-operated flight through United is that you are not always able to pick a seat in advance. That ended up being the case for this flight, and I was dreading the possibility of a back-of-the-bus middle seat. Luckily, seat availability was still good when I checked in online, even though the flight ended up being full.

I had only flown the A380 once before (on Emirates) and assumed that the upper deck was first and business class only. To my surprise, there was an ’œupper deck’ tab on the seat selection window during online check-in. It turns out that on Lufthansa’s newest layout for some of its A380s, there is a premium economy section in the front of the lower deck and a small section ’“ five rows, to be exact ’“ of standard economy at the back of the upper deck. I snagged a window seat at the front of the latter section, thrilled that I would finally get upper-deck bragging rights (though without the usual business class accouterments that usually go with it).

LUFTHANSA A380 ECONOMY FLIGHT: Pre-flight & lounges

LH455 departs from the Star Alliance’s half of the shiny and spacious international terminal at SFO. There was no TSA PreCheck lane at the security checkpoint for the G gates, but Star Alliance Gold status got me into a separate ’œGold Track’ that only took five or ten minutes.

As a coach class flyer on a student budget, I’ll take any perks I can get. I especially love the free lounge entry privileges that Star Alliance Golds get on international itineraries. Lufthansa doesn’t have a dedicated lounge at SFO, so travelers are directed to the gargantuan United Club. However, Star Alliance Golds can get into any Star Alliance member airline lounge in the terminal. At SFO G gates, my choices included Sinagpore and EVA’s offerings. I recalled having an amazing experience on the first and only Singapore Airlines flight I’d ever taken (SFO-ICN-SIN-BKK) and so I headed for their lounge at the base of the terminal.

SQ has only two daily flights out of SFO, so its modestly proportioned lounge is only open in the early afternoon and later at night. I was able to catch the last half hour of the afternoon period. Two seating areas with space for around thirty passengers each were divided by a set of counters with a good selection of food and a self-serve bar. Singapore’s flight was boarding so the lounge was emptying out, but I could see how it might have been a bit crowded earlier.

I had a great time with the DIY laksa station, pouring a spicy coconut-based broth over pre-prepared bowls of noodles, seafood, and boiled eggs. The broth’s flavor reminded me of a Thai red curry, but the noodles and seafood were very different. I loved it, but beware: it’s definitely spicy!

The drinks counter had a mini-fridge with sodas and water, a Nespresso station, and a well stocked self-serve bar with options like Belvedere and Gran Marnier. As I took a seat, I took in the solid view out over the tarmac, including the SQ 777-300ER that was about to depart.

Overall, I’d rate the Singapore lounge highly for travelers who happen to be passing through SFO G gates when the lounge is open, with the food and drink options as the standout factors. I believe there may also be a shower there, though I was not able to check that out. The downsides are the potential crowd factor at peak times, as well as the limited hours of availability.

Before heading to my gate, I decided to check out the United Club lounge for a few minutes. WOW, the place was massive. Wrapping around the side of the building one floor up from the main concourse, it had multiple rooms and tons of space. Some were pretty full, but others ’“ along with the bar ’“ had plenty of free seating.

Food options were unimpressive at the time ’“ pita chips with hummus, trail mix, and some chips ’“ though United has since updated the food it offers in its lounges. The best part about the space was the view. With expansive windows and a great north-facing view, I got a great look at the heavies departing along runways 28. On the whole, while the UA lounge was not a bad place to kill some time, it wasn’t much of a step up from the United Clubs in domestic concourses.

LUFTHANSA A380 ECONOMY FLIGHT: Flight basics

Airline: Lufthansa

Aircraft: Airbus A380-800 (Version 3)

Departed: San Francisco International Airport (SFO)

Arrived: Frankfurt International Airport (FRA)

Class: Economy class

Seat: 95A (upper deck, emergency exit row, no window)

Flight length: 10 hours

Star Alliance Gold got me access to a separate boarding area on the upper concourse level with much less of a crowd, but since I was headed for economy I rejoined the bigger crowd shortly after. I was hoping to board through the upper-deck jetway so I could take an aspirational peek at business class, but I was instead sent onto the lower jetway. I walked the length of the lower deck economy cabin, which really let the size of the plane sink in, before ascending the semicircular stairway to the back of the upper deck. I was seated in the left-hand window seat of the first row of the upper deck economy section. I was the last passenger in this section to board, and all the overhead bin space had been taken. A flight attendant graciously took my bag and placed it in a bin in the adjoining business class cabin ’“ big bonus points for saving me from a gate check.

Taking a seat and getting my bearings, I was impressed by how new and fresh the cabin dcor was. The color scheme was refined without being too bright, with seat upholstery in a modest gray with deep blue and bright yellow accents. The standard economy seats were a bit stingy in terms of dimensions, with 17’ width and 31’ pitch. Luckily for me, I’m a pretty skinny guy and the exit row seating gave me more legroom than I’ve ever had on a flight. For the wider and taller folks out there, premium economy may be worth considering if you can’t snag an exit row seat.

LUFTHANSA A380 ECONOMY FLIGHT: Checking out the upper deck

Sitting in the upper deck ended up being a great experience. While downstairs seating was 3x4x3, up here it was 2x4x2, meaning easier aisle access for the window seats. The five-row mini-cabin had only 35 seats and its own dedicated flight attendant and lavatory, a slightly better ratio than downstairs. The geometry of the upper deck, with walls sloping inwards as opposed to an outward slope downstairs, made for a cozier feel. Window seats on the upper deck had a six-inch ledge between the armrest and the wall that contained a small storage space ’“ enough for a few magazines, a laptop, or maybe even a small bag. I can see why these are popular. The ledge also meant that window seats had a solid amount of extra elbow room.

Especially during pushback and taxi, I was disappointed that my seat did not have a window. Angling my head I could catch a glimpse out of the window behind me, but with the curtains open between economy and business class I ended up looking at the tail cam that was playing on one of the large screens in there.

It’s pretty amazing to watch from the ground as an A380 takes off, but from onboard it’s almost anticlimactic. Compared to other planes, there was strikingly little cabin noise and the plane lifted off sooner than I was expecting, though I suppose this flight wasn’t pushing the plane’s range envelope. A right-side window seat for flights departing SFO for Europe gives you a great view of downtown San Francisco as the plane flies in an arc around the city. For the hardcore flight trackers out there, print out the SNTNA TWO departure chart beforehand; I believe it is the one used for European departures.

During the climbout I struck up a conversation with the flight attendant sitting in the jump seat diagonally in front of me. She shared that the upper deck economy section was a relatively new addition to Lufthansa’s A380 fleet and (to her knowledge) has not been implemented across the fleet.

As the service portion of the flight began, the benefits of having a 35-to-1 passenger-to-FA ratio became clear. Just a few minutes after the double chime, our jovial flight attendant came by with pretzels and fixed me a refreshingly stiff pre-dinner gin and tonic.

After a hot towel, we were given the choice of chicken or vegetarian pasta entrees. The chicken had an Asian-inspired sweet and sour sauce and vegetables on the side. I thought it was pretty good for economy class fare, though a bit heavy on the rice. I always appreciate a salad that has more than just iceberg lettuce. The more colors the better, science suggests. Both the roll and the brownie were on the tough side.

After dinner I explored the entertainment system, which for my exit row seat folded up from the armrest. The interface was slick and very responsive to the touch. I found the selection solid but not quite as good as United’s library.

Before trying to get some sleep, I got up to stretch my legs and look around. You can actually take a pretty decent walk on the A380 ’“ good news for any FitBit aficionados or other activity trackers out there. With the cabin lights out, flight attendants had neatly laid out snacks and cups of water and juice at each galley for passengers to help themselves to. A nugget of health wisdom: drinking plenty of water in flight isn’t just good for dealing with dry cabin air. It can also reduce many individuals’ risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a dangerous clotting condition that occurs more frequently in passengers on long-haul flights.

As I reclined my seat and got ready to sleep, I realized that the inward slope of the fuselage on the upper deck made it a bit harder to lean my head against a window to sleep. Still, I managed to get around five hours of mostly uninterrupted shuteye. With the relative quiet of the A380 cabin, I barely needed my noise-cancelling headphones.

About an hour before landing the crew came around and served breakfast: an omelet with some greens and potatoes. Eggs are tricky to do well on a plane, but this ranked as one of the better in-flight omelets that I’ve had. The descent and landing were smooth, and soon we were parked at Frankfurt International Airport’s C gates. Although I had to board through the lower deck, we were allowed to deplane from the upper deck. I was glad to catch a glimpse at the business class cabin and snag a picture of the Great White Whale from the outside.

The C concourse at Frankfurt requires a pretty lengthy walk to reach the arrivals area. It felt surprisingly strange to cross out of the transit lounge, as I’ve transferred at Frankfurt plenty of times before but have never entered the city. A fantastic week in Germany with family followed, with great scenery, impactful history, and not-insignificant quantities of hefeweizen beer.

LUFTHANSA A380 ECONOMY FLIGHT: Final Verdict

I’d rate my experience on LH455 pretty well on its own merits, and even more positively when compared to my experience flying the same route on United’s older 747s. The interior of the plane looked and felt new, the plane is quiet in flight (great for light sleepers), service was friendly, and the food was pretty good, though not spectacular.

The upper deck cabin was an additional value-add, with a cozier feel, better seating configuration, and zippier service. The primary downsides I can think of on this flight were the stingy seat dimensions in standard economy (though not worse than the standard economy dimensions on United’s 747s), lack of TSA PreCheck, and the default use of United’s lounge at SFO.

Airbus' Newest Design Is Based on Bones and Slime Mold - WIRED,"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL2FpcmJ1c3MtbmV3ZXN0LWRlc2lnbi1pcy1iYXNlZC1vbi1zbGltZS1tb2xkLWFuZC1ib25lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When you board a flight, you probably don’t notice the partition that separates the crew’s work station from the rest of the cabin. On an aircraft, people tend to pay attention to their seat, their neighbors, and whether there’s space for their carry-on bags. That partition is unglamorous infrastructure that fades into the background.

Unless, of course, you’re an aircraft manufacturer, in which case that partition is a major engineering headache. Like everything on an airplane, that wall must be as light as possible, and consume the smallest amount of space. And like everything on an airplane, it must be strong: That partition bears the weight of flight attendants who, during takeoff and landing, sit on fold-out chairs affixed to it. Such a requirement tends to make partitions heavy and bulky.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, like everyone else in the industry, wants to fly lighter, more efficient planes. In its mission to do so, Airbus has partnered with Autodesk to rethink the design of those lowly partitions. Its new partition debuted today at the Autodesk University conference in Las Vegas and, thanks to 3-D printing and some wild new algorithms based on slime mold and bone growth, it weighs in at just 66 pounds. Airbus's current partitions weigh 143 pounds apiece. “Our goal was to reduce the weight by 30 percent, and we altogether achieved weight reduction by 55 percent,” says Bastian Schaefer, innovation manager at Airbus. “And we’re right at the beginning.”

Autodesk

The beginning might more accurately be 2011, when Airbus unveiled Future By Airbus, its vision for flying in 2050. It included a concept cabin, many features of which were so forward-thinking as to seem frivolous or unattainable—like a virtual gaming wall for tennis, golf, and basketball. But other aspects of the plan, like aircraft components designed and printed with additive manufacturing techniques, were well within reach of current and near-future production practices. Schaefer says the more immediately attainable design objectives were particularly important to Airbus’s ambitions: “This is still the goal, to be able to print an entire airplane, or large components of it.”

More recently, Schaefer has worked with architect David Benjamin, principal of The Living, on making that “large component” part of the plan a reality. The Living is an avant-garde architecture practice that makes structures that are in some sense alive, like a tower of fungus bricks, or a glass building containing living frogs. Autodesk bought it last year as part of its effort to expand research on synthetic biology. With the Airbus partnership, Benjamin is still doing what The Living does—turning to biology for architectural inspiration—but this time it’s the software, not the materials, that are based on nature.

Benjamin has harnessed two naturally recurring design patterns and built algorithms that mimic them. His intention was to solve the load-bearing puzzle of the airplane partition with a design that weighed as little as possible. He describes the final product, the Bionic Partition, in terms of its macro design—the larger frame—and micro design, which includes the lattices connecting the bigger perimeter. Benjamin based the algorithm for the macro frame on the growth patterns of slime mold, a single-celled organism that can naturally, and uncannily, create a strong, efficient structure between two fixed points. The micro elements of the partition mimic mammalian bone growth, filling open spaces with delicate grid structures. Benjamin says the design principles are similar to those used by the Autodesk Within Medical program, which uses generative algorithms to create implants for reconstructive surgeries.

With these algorithms in place, Benjamin and Airbus could define parameters for the partition and let the software do its thing. “We can generate literally tens of thousands of design iterations, compared with the manual process which could generate maybe a dozen,” says Benjamin, echoing other advocates of generative design at Autodesk."

My commute to work is measured in blocks not miles. Compared to the average North American I use tiny little sips of water and power. I already own all the physical stuff I’m ever going to need or want. I’m practically invisible in terms of my personal impact on the environment. Yet I enjoying a very high quality of life.

Where’s my halo, damn it!

Except…

I fly a lot. I mean… a lot. Sometimes I feel like I’m in the air more than on the ground. I fly primarily because I can. I have access to various personal and business connections that allow me to travel at heavily subsidized rates which in no way reflect the real cost of the flights – on many levels. I may as well live in a giant house on the edge of the metroplex and drive a massive SUV two hours to work every day as far as my environmental footprint is concerned. I’m really just a cheap carbon whore.

I occasionally attempt to rationalize my activities. For example, I know for a fact that if I exercise restraint and stop flying entirely for the rest of my life someone else somewhere on the planet will burn up that fuel instead. The oil isn’t going to stay in the ground just because I don’t use it. The global demand for fuel is insatiable. It might be burned by an entire village of rural peasants in India over a lifetime of heating and cooking. Or it might be used in an instant to convert sea water into irrigation for a golf course in Dubai. But it’s going to be burned regardless of my individual piety.

Like I said. This is a self serving rationalization. But it still reflects reality. And I have 7.3 billion data points to back me up. That’s the current human population all dipping in to the oil well together – and it’s a race to the bottom.

So here’s how I think about my nasty flying habit instead. It’s entirely discretionary. So is driving, which I do very little of. So is eating meat, which I could live without. So are most of the things I do in my life. My base consumption is very very low and it can get even lower without me feeling deprived in any way. I have a degree of personal resilience in my life. There’s slack and wiggle room. If I believed that I was part of a much larger global movement to voluntarily pull back, to make modest adjustments in order to serve a larger cohesive cause for social justice… I absolutely would. But for the moment, I see no point. We either all do this together or we don’t do it at all.

"Airbus Sold More Than 1,000 Airplanes in 2015, Beating Boeing - Fortune","Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi8wOC9haXJidXMtYWlycGxhbmUtc2FsZXMtMjAxNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has sold more than 1,000 aircraft in the first 11 months of this year, making the European aerospace giant more or less a lock to win its annual order competition with rival Boeing (“BA”). But with deliveries lagging, Airbus will almost certainly fail to meet its production targets for 2015, letting Boeing hold onto the “world’s largest plane maker” crown.

In terms of aircraft orders, Airbus outsold Boeing 1,007 to 568, excluding cancellations. Boeing, meanwhile, out-delivered Airbus by a wide margin, with 709 aircraft delivered over the same period. Airbus handed over the keys to just 556 aircraft in the first 11 months of the year, leaving it 74 aircraft short of its 2015 production target.

Given that Airbus is averaging 50 aircraft per month in 2015, it would have to lift production rates by roughly 50% to hit its end-of year target. Meanwhile Boeing is on target to produce the 750 to 755 aircraft it set out deliver this year, though it has some work to do if the company is going to fulfill its goal of selling as many aircraft as it produces in 2015.

While the lopsided order book suggests Airbus is trouncing Boeing sales, a deeper reading of the numbers tells a more nuanced story, says Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.

“Boeing’s actually a little bit ahead,” he says. “The idea of looking at any one year—it’s fun for bragging rights but otherwise it’s completely meaningless when you’ve got an industry with 12,000 jets on backlog. What you’ve got is a situation where Airbus is a little ahead in number of tails, but Boeing is slightly ahead in value. Airbus has a better position in the narrow-body market, Boeing is ahead in wide-body, and together it works out to be about 50-50.”

Airbus has enjoyed strong sales over the last several years, particularly for the latest iteration of its popular A320 narrow-body jet–the A320neo–which will begin commercial operation next month. But the company has had trouble keeping pace on the production side. Deliveries of its wide-body A350 lag 2015 projections, with just 11 of the jets delivered so far in 2015 (four short of the company’s target). Airbus plans to deliver 30 A350s in 2016 even as Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier has acknowledged that suppliers are already having trouble coping with Airbus’s increased rate of production on the A350 line.

That could spell trouble for the company going into 2016, though there’s plenty of good news for Airbus in the latest batch of industry numbers. Airbus’s strong position relative to Boeing in the narrow-body jetliner market persists. As Boeing hosted media at its Everett, Wash., manufacturing facility on Monday and Tuesday for a public unveiling of its new 737MAX narrow-body airliner, numbers released by Airbus showed that it has grabbed 60% of the market for fuel-efficient, smaller-body jets.

That market segment that continues to boom thanks to demand for short-haul air travel routes in Asia and elsewhere. And with Boeing’s 737MAX slated to enter service no sooner than 2017, Airbus has time to press its advantage. Boeing has sold just 292 jets in the 737MAX family thus far this year, compared with 781 in the same period last year. Airbus logged 825 orders for the A320neo, up from 782 the year before. All said, Airbus has 4,443 A320neos, while Boeing has just shy of 3,000 737MAX jets on order.

Whether or not Airbus can retain that market advantage will depend on several factors, not least each company’s ability to execute its aggressive manufacturing programs. Both Airbus and Boeing are pushing manufacturing rates skyward as orders continue to swell. But from an investor standpoint, Aboulafia says, the factors that could have the biggest impact on the industry are completely out of their CEOs’ hands: fuel prices and interest rates.

If oil prices remain low and the cost of borrowing inches upward, the industry could quickly find itself in trouble, he says. When fuel is costly and cash is cheap, it makes a lot of sense for airlines to look at replacing older, less efficient airplanes with newer, more efficient models. But if the environment changes, airlines may be less likely to buy new planes.

“We’ve been living in this incredibly perfect environment for seven or eight years now where cash is almost free and there’s every reason in the world to replace your older aircraft,” Aboulafia says. “One of those is changing and the other one could well change.”

Lufthansa bumps out Qatar Airways for first Airbus A320neo - USA TODAY,"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE1LzEyLzE0L2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1idW1wcy1vdXQtcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1sYXVuY2gtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8vNzcyNjgxNDYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lufthansa bumps out Qatar Airways for first Airbus A320neo

German carrier Lufthansa -- and not Qatar Airways -- will be the launch customer for Airbus’ new A320neo jet.

The move is a surprising last-minute switch. For more than a year, both Airbus and Qatar Airways had been touting Qatar Airways as the first airline to take delivery of the new aircraft. Lufthansa and Airbus now say that the German carrier is likely to take delivery of the jet by the end of the month, making it the first airline in the world to take possession of a A320neo.

""We came to a mutual understanding that Lufthansa will be the first airline to start the delivery stream,"" Airbus said in a statement to Dow Jones Business News. ""Thus we confirm Lufthansa will become the A320neo launch customer this year.""

BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage

News of a shake-up in the delivery order was first reported last week by the trade-industry magazine Aviation Week, which said the Doha-based airline had developed concerns over the aircraft’s Pratt & Whitney engines. Qatar Airways offered no comment, but the company said recently that it still anticipated receiving its first A320neo before the end of the year.

That the launch customers for the jet would change so close to delivery is unusual. Aircraft manufacturers typically announce launch customers for new jets well in advance for the plane's first delivery. In the case of the A320neo, Airbus had announced back in 2014 that Qatar Airways would be the aircraft's first operator.

Airbus has been promising first A320neo delivery in 2015 for some time, and the company says it will still do so even as the year nears its end. Dates for such matters tend to be quite fluid. However, Lufthansa has suggested that delivery could take place around the 22nd of the month.



The A320neo -- neo is short for ""new-engine-option"" -- is an upgraded version of Airbus’ successful A320-family line of narrow-body, single-aisle jets. Sporting new engines, enhanced winglets, and other improvements, Airbus says the jet could be 15% more efficient than current generation A320-family models.

Both Lufthansa and Qatar Airways have substantial orders for the jet on the books, at 101 and 50, respectively. Airbus has logged over 4,300 orders for the airplanes to date.



The backlog, which does not include additional orders for the current generation of A320 jets, has prompted Airbus to say it will boost production of the airplanes to 60 per month in 2019. That would be a substantial increase from the current 42.



The jet is in hot competition with Boeing’s 737 MAX, which itself is a similarly upgraded narrow-body, single-aisle aircraft. Airbus and Boeing have been locked in a battle for single-aisle market share ever since the A320 hit the skies for the first time in the late 1980s.

Boeing’s jet, however, is roughly one year behind the A320neo. The first 737 MAX rolled out of a Boeing factory in Renton, Wash., last week. It is expected to make its first flight in early 2016 and first delivery in 2017.

Qatar Airways shows off its new Dreamliners"
Innovative or impossible? Airbus patent detaches the cabin from the airplane - CNN,"Thu, 03 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWRldGFjaGFibGUtY2FiaW4vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights If the cabin is detached, the plane can be used for other things during boarding Airports would have to be redesigned to adapt to the model

CNN —

Squeezing out a net profit is tough in the airline business. And while straining to do so, plane manufacturers have come up with some interesting ideas.

The latest: Turn cabins – the part of the plane where you sit – into detachable modules separate from the planes. Then mix ‘em and match ‘em, and you save all kinds of time and money, says Airbus, which got a U.S. patent on the idea this week.

But first, back to those profits. With the peppery price of a plane ticket, you don’t believe it, eh?

Currently, airlines pocket an average of $8.27 per passenger, said the International Air Transport Association. And that’s a recent improvement, thanks to falling fuel prices and a rebounding economy.

Airplane manufacturer Airbus has patented a modular system, where the cabin is detached from the plane during boarding. Airbus

Weird, uncomfortable seats

Remember the recent weird patents for cramped plane seats? Bicycle-style stools, passenger seats piled on top of each other, dividers that you lean against instead of sitting on? Those patents pinch pennies by cramming more passengers into a cabin.

But the new detachable cabin model and its potential accomplishments are much more complex, Airbus said in its new patent filing, which was entered in February but granted this week. A report about it was first published in Wired.

Here’s how the idea works.

Instead of boarding a whole plane, passengers climb into the detached cabin, which is suspended in a dock at the gate on crane-like arms.

Windowless cockpits, Airbus — Last year, Airbus filed a patent that totally reimagines the concept of the cockpit. For starters, the cockpit would move away from a window. Instead, the patent floats the idea of the cockpit being stored underneath the cabin or at the back of the plane. This would allow the nose of the plane to be longer, pointier, and hence more aerodynamic. Pilots would glimpse the world outside using a digital display. Designed by Jason Kwok Smart windows, Airbus — According to a patent filed in March , passengers may one day be able to use their window as an interactive touchscreen. Theoretically, fliers could pull up information on a major landmark as they pass over it, or maybe even prompt access to a complimentary media library -- fly over the Empire State building while watching ""Sleepless in Seattle"" perhaps? Designed by Jason Kwok Flying donut, Airbus — Evoking Candy Land, Airbus filed a patent last year for this confectionery-shaped aircraft -- complete with a hole in the middle. Though unusual-looking, the ring shape actually makes good sense. According to the patent application, it allows for more passengers than traditional, tube-shaped aircrafts can fit in, and distributes cabin pressure more evenly, ultimately decreasing stress to the structure. Designed by Jason Kwok Virtual reality IFE, Airbus — In-flight entertainment may soon evolve from glitchy headphones and seatback screens. If a patent Airbus filed last August is anything to go by, we may all find ourselves fully immersed in the movie (or video game, or concert) with the help of virtual reality helmets (that patent even hints there may be an olfactory function). The patent states the helmets would provide ""sensorial isolation,"" thereby reducing stress for nervous flyers. Designed by Jason Kwok Terrorist trap door, Airbus — In 2002, Airbus filed a patent for a trap door positioned outside of the cockpit. Theoretically, should a terrorist or hijacker try to force their way into the cockpit, a trap door would open and send them into a security cell underneath the cabin floor. Designed by Jason Kwok Force field, Boeing — In 2012, USPTO granted Boeing a patent for what is basically a force field (think Star Trek deflector shields). The device, according to the patent, would detect the shockwave from a nearby explosion and create what is essentially a plasma field to protect against the oncoming blast. Designed by Jason Kwok Airbus and Boeing have some amazing plane ideas to shape the future of flying Prev Next

The whole time people are heaving carry-ons and shimmying into seats, the rest of the plane can be away from the gate, getting more fuel or a mechanical check. It’s not stuck waiting for passengers to get settled.

And stepping aboard would be a breeze for passengers, since the cabin floor would be flush with a floor at the gate.

“Transfer of passengers, luggage or freight can thus be accomplished optimally, and in particular without using a staircase or a lift or elevator,” the patent filing read.

Then, there’s reality

Waiting areas at gates would hardly be necessary anymore, since people would directly seat themselves in the modules. That would also save boarding time, and security checks could be run incrementally, as passengers arrived at the cabin.

Cabin modules could also be customized to hold freight, so the underlying planes could be used to transport both people and product.

The cockpit would be solidly attached to the plane part, rather than the cabin module, so pilots could steer the plane around on the ground as needed.

Nifty idea, but plane redesigns can take years and years, especially such massive ones.

And in this case, airports would also have to be redesigned massively to accommodate the modular pod idea.

As with many outlandish-sounding patents, this one may never see the light of day. Airline companies file hundreds of patents each year, Airbus said.

“We do this to protect our ideas, but many of these never actually develop beyond concept stages,” said Robert Gage, head of media relations for Airbus in the United Kingdom."

The Airbus Shopfloor Challenge invites robotics teams from around the world to create innovative robotic solutions for a real-life manufacturing challenge, and compete live at the IEEE 2016 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 15-21 May 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden. Deadline to apply is March 15, 2016.

About the Airbus Shopfloor Challenge

With a backlog of almost 7000 aircraft on order, at Airbus we are constantly innovating to find ways to improve our manufacturing processes by integrating emerging robotic technologies into our production lines.

Each aircraft is assembled through hundreds of thousands of point-based process steps. Most tasks involve a drilling process, a point-checking (i.e. measurement) process, and a tightening process. While some operations are automated, many remain manual due to a number of constraints – including space and weight restrictions. Using lightweight automation to perform such tasks would reduce the volume of the most repetitive, physically challenging labour of thousands of aircraft operators.

Because each generation of our manufacturing lines has a lifetime of more than a decade, robotic solutions need to be integrated into existing production environments, with no dedicated physical infrastructure. Accuracy requirements are stringent, and quality is paramount. Since errors in a single step can lead to costly fixes and even disruptions in production, solutions have to meet high reliability standards. In addition, they have to be cost effective in order to be widely deployed in existing Airbus factories.

Competing teams will design and build an autonomous lightweight robotic system able to perform accurate drilling compliant with aeronautic standards. Robots will perform several rounds of a simplified drilling task on an artefact representing part of the aircraft fuselage. Success will be measured based on the number of holes drilled within a specified time and accuracy. Some of the holes will be more challenging due to access constraints. Weight cost of the robot will also be taken into account.

Airbus will send panels to qualifying teams. We are willing to support contestants with equipment and material, subject to their proposal and needs.

The winning Airbus Shopfloor Challenge team will receive a cash prize, but more importantly, the team will have the opportunity to develop their idea for commercial application within Airbus. Other teams with promising solutions may also be invited to develop their idea further with Airbus.

Challenge details

The competition will run live during ICRA 2016. It will consist of multiple 60-minute rounds of drilling holes in an aluminium panel representing an aircraft part. The final round will be a confrontation between the top two teams.

The robot must be able to drill over the whole surface while installed on a fixed station. Multiple arms/effectors are allowed as a solution, as long as adequate fleet/synchronisation management is performed.

Hand-held electrical tools are currently used as end effectors, but participants are free to propose their own system. Manual lubrication is allowed. Airbus will work with qualifying teams to supply drilling tools and cutters.

No data transmission or remote control will be permitted during a round.

All algorithms must use an open source system as the main driver.

To qualify for the contest, the robot has to be:

Modularly designed, at least at the arm level

Weigh less than 100kg

Airbus aims to ramp up H125 production in Mississippi - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtdG8tcmFtcC11cC1oMTI1LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW4tbWlzc2lzc2lwcGkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H125 is widely used by law enforcement agencies, air medical service providers, business-owner-operators and for utility missions.

Airbus plans to produce twice as many H125 helicopters at its Columbus, Miss. assembly plant next year as it did in 2015.

But while that would be a big step forward, it’s only the start of what may eventually come if North American demand for the single-engine rotorcraft increases as expected.

“We’re matching production with demand, and we have very positive thoughts about where the market is and what the demand will be,” said Doug Carriger, senior director of marketing for Airbus Helicopters Inc.

“But we’re also ramping that up in a smart way because we can still also get them from France if we have excess demand that we need to serve.”

Airbus plans to produce 24 H125s in Columbus next year, up from 12 in 2015, but the plant has capacity to produce about 65 a year.

“We’re, of course, in a cyclical market right now,” Carriger said. “But we’re having good years in law enforcement, air medical and corporate VIP.

“So we absolutely see demand, at least in the 50 aircraft range, in the not-too-distant future.”

The H125 is widely used by law enforcement agencies, air medical service providers, business-owner-operators and for utility missions.

Its assembly for the North American market moved to Columbus from Marignane, France, in late 2014 in a bid to be closer to customers and to the market in general.

“We’re really excited about that development, and the primary reason is, North America and the United States in particular are primarily a single-engine helicopter market,” Carriger said.

“So any given year, 60 to 70 percent of the aircraft delivered are going to be single-engine aircraft. So we know this market very well and the company trusted us to know the market, to do well by the production and let us bring it here, closer to the customers.”

The Columbus plant has more than 240 workers and does full assembly of the H125, as well as the UH-72A Lakota light utility helicopter for the U.S. Army.

Airbus delivered 27 Lakotas to the U.S. Army from its Columbus plant in 2015 but has the capacity to produce about 60 a year.

There is an Army order backlog of 65 Lakotas to deliver in 2016-17, said Airbus senior communications manager Bob Cox.

“So that production rate will be going up the next two years,” Cox said.

Demand for the H125 may depend in part on a rebound in the price of oil, which affects activity in the Gulf of Mexico – a very important single-engine helicopter market, Carriger said.

“About half of the aircraft operating in the Gulf of Mexico are single-engine, near-shore, continental shelf work,” he added. “So as that comes back, that has the ability to generate quite a bit of demand.”

The first H125 AStar produced at the Columbus plant went to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, a long-time customer that has been flying Airbus products for years, Carriger said.

“We were really excited to deliver the first AStar off the line to them,” he said.

“I think the significance (of the Columbus assembly line) is that Airbus is investing heavily in North America,” Carriger added.

“Between the plant in Mississippi, the recent plant in Mobile, Alabama – they’re all signs that Airbus is growing its presence and participates in the lives of the employees and the lives of the customers, and is a vital element of the aerospace industry in the U.S.”"

The patent includes a huge rocket engine that would enable the jet to travel at more than four times the speed of sound, which means it could cross the Atlantic in less time that it takes to cross London on a bus.

Patent Yogi

Plans for a supersonic jet were first released by Airbus in July this year, but it looks as though the company has gone back to the drawing board to make improvements to their initial design. The two designs have clear differences.

Here's a graphic of the original July design, which looks very different to a traditional passenger jet:

Airbus

And this is what the new design looks like in the patent images. It's far more conventional:

US Patent Office

The airplane is described by the company as ""a space aircraft capable of taking off from the ground in the usual manner, reaching an altitude of at least a hundred kilometres, flying at a transsonic or even supersonic speed, and then landing in the usual manner of an aircraft.""

The plane would have a huge rocket engine at the back of the body, with two turbojet engines on either side of it. The turbojets would fly the plane up to a certain altitude, before the rocket engine ignites, sending the plane vertically upwards to its final altitude.

Related stories

At first ignition, the rocket engine would make a huge supersonic boom, creating enormous drag on the aircraft, which Airbus says it would counter this with anti-drag flaps.

US Patent Office

When it released the original designs back in July, Airbus said that the hypersonic jet could have both civilian and military applications. In civilian trim, the craft could serve as private jet or as an airliner with room for 20 passengers. When used by the military, the jet could serve as transport for soldiers or as a reconnaissance plane.

Patent Yogi has released a great video showing just how Airbus' new design might look if it ever actually goes into production.

You can check out some clips from the video here:

Airbus, like many technology companies, files hundreds of patents a year to protect its intellectual property. It doesn't mean all of these ideas will become reality. Two weeks ago, for example, it patented a crazy new way of loading passengers onto planes.

The vast majority of patents never get off the drawing board, but the fact that the company has filed two separate patents for the same device suggests that it may seriously be considering trying to make the supersonic jet in the coming years.

Airbus surpassed Boeing in wide-body passenger orders through November, data released yesterday by Airbus shows.

Airbus released its November YTD order book yesterday. Boeing last week updated its weekly order tallies through Dec. 2.

Airbus trailed Boeing in wide-body passenger aircraft orders throughout the year, but now posted 134 orders to 113 for passenger wide-body aircraft. The orders were for 134 A330ceos/neos and for 42 777 Classics and Xs. Cancellations for 19 A350-900s were offset by an equal number of A330-900s as TAP Portugal swapped one model for the other. There were 14 new orders for A350s, leaving a net cancellation of five YTD. This left Airbus with a net of 127 wide-body passenger orders for the year compared with Boeing’s 113.

Airbus has a 54% market share of wide-body passenger orders through November.

Boeing cleaned up on freighter orders. Airbus posted four A330F orders in the first 11 months of the year. Boeing posted 66 orders, boosted by 48 from FedEx. Two 747-8Fs were posted; these had been white tails and were leased to Air Bridge Cargo, but are owned by Boeing Capital Corp.

Airbus blew away Boeing in the single aisle competition YTD, with 876 orders for the A320ceo/neo family compared with 389 737NGs/MAXes, resulting in a 69% market share for Airbus.

Boeing’s effort to sell 777 Classics to fill the production bridge to the 777X is so far falling short of the goal of 40-60 sales a year. Boeing booked orders for 22 777-300ERs and 16 777Fs, or 38 in total. Marketing is counting on a follow-on sale to United Airlines for another 10-12 777-300ERs before then end of the year to boost these numbers. Boeing booked sales for 20 777Xs this year.

TAM Airlines, Brazil, has received the first Airbus A350 XWB ever delivered to the Americas, and becomes the fourth airline in the world to operate this next-generation, energy-efficient aircraft.

“We are pioneers in bringing this aircraft to the region, and its arrival in the Americas reinforces our constant commitment to maintaining one of the youngest and most innovative fleets in the world,” said Claudia Sender, CEO of TAM S.A. “We want to offer our passengers even greater comfort, with aircraft equipped with the most modern aviation technology, that are more efficient and produce lower environmental impact.”

In March, the A350 XWB will begin international service from São Paulo/Guarulhos to Miami International Airport, and in April, the aircraft will begin flying from São Paulo/Guarulhos to Madrid, Barajas. The aircraft will also serve routes from São Paulo/Guarulhos to Orlando International Airport, starting in the second half of 2016.

The airline will take delivery of six additional A350 XWBs in 2016, and has ordered 27 A350XWB aircraft in all; an investment valued at $7 billion (list price), scheduled for delivery through 2021.

TAM’s new A350 is configured in a two-class cabin with 348 seats, 318 in Economy Class and 30 full flat seats in Premium Business class.

The airline’s fourth A350 XWB aircraft, scheduled for delivery in June of next year, will introduce a third service class: Economy Plus, offering more legroom between seats. That aircraft will offer 30 seats in Premium Business class, 63 in Economy Plus and 246 in Economy Class.

“We always pay close attention to the scenario and adjust our fleet renewal plan to obtain optimum aircraft allocation in each market. The A350 XWB joins our fleet with the mission of operating as one of the main aircraft on long-haul flights to the United States and Europe. The combination of its wider fuselage, advanced composite material and unique cabin provide an even more pleasant travel experience and more efficient operations,” said José Zaidan Maluf, vice-president of Fleet and Engines at LATAM Airlines Group.

The A350 XWB plays a key role in the airline’s long-haul strategy moving forward, allowing it to carry larger numbers of passengers efficiently and comfortably.

In September of this year, LATAM Airlines Group changed its order for six of its A350-900s to longer A350-1000s, which have can fit more passengers onboard."

Airbus Helicopters Photo

Airbus Helicopters Inc. has delivered a new H125 AStar to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office in Ft. Myers, Fla. The new H125, when completed, will increase the Lee County AStar fleet from two to three helicopters.

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office performs a wide variety of missions including law enforcement patrol and searches for lost and missing persons. The agency will have a hoist installed on their new H125 in order perform additional search and rescue missions in the coastal area around Ft. Myers. Hangar One Avionics in Carlsbad, Calif. will perform the law enforcement completion on the Lee County H125.

“The power and performance of the H125 will improve our unit’s capabilities and enable us to perform additional missions as we expand our fleet,” said Michael Warner, Aviation Division commander for the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. “We have a long relationship with Airbus Helicopters, and they have given us the support we need to keep our helicopters in the air.”

Lee County recently picked up an older AStar after it underwent a 12-year inspection at Airbus Helicopters Inc.’s maintenance and repair facility in Grand Prairie. The thorough 12-year inspection, which includes new enhancements, Federal Aviation Administration mandated upgrades and a factory paint job resets FAA maintenance cycle times.

“Florida sheriffs continue to depend on Airbus Helicopters to provide airborne support for the deputies on the ground,” said Ed Van Winkle, senior sales manager for Airborne Law Enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “Lee County’s selection of the H125 AStar demonstrates the trust they have in our aircraft and our ability to support their missions.”

Airbus Helicopters’ H125/AS350-series is the helicopter-of-choice for U.S. law enforcement agencies with more than 225 in use across the country. The H125 (formerly AS350 B3e) is the latest version of Airbus Helicopters long-running AStar series of helicopters and is built at the company’s Columbus, Miss. assembly plant.

The top selling helicopter in its class, the AStar is a favorite of U.S. law enforcement agencies because of its power and maneuverability, load carrying capacity and hot-and-high performance.

The H125 features dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, 30-minute take-off power and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays.

This New Airbus Carbon Fibre Plane Is Designed to Beat Jetlag - ScienceAlert,"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VhbGVydC5jb20vdGhpcy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWNhcmJvbi1maWJyZS1wbGFuZS1pcy1kZXNpZ25lZC10by1iZWF0LWpldGxhZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the biggest downsides to a long-haul flight - aside from being cooped up in a metal box for hours - is waiting for your body to readjust to the new time zone once you touch down. But commercial aircraft companies Airbus and Qatar Airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane.

The A350 XWB comes with a variety of improvements designed to minimise that groggy feeling you get from flying halfway around the world. One of the main innovations is a system of LED lights inside the cabin that are designed to change colour to mimic the Sun's natural glow - and they're programmed to fit in with our bodies' natural circadian rhythms no matter what the actual time is.

What's more, the plane's filtering system refreshes the air inside the cabin every 2 or 3 minutes, and keeps it pressurised at the equivalent of an altitude of 1,828.8 metres (6,000 feet). Again, Airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground.

There's much more to this plane besides anti-jetlag measures. Over 50 percent of the frame is made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic, reducing the weight of the aircraft and of course the amount of fuel required for long-haul flights. Larger and wider wings, together with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than the wind, combine to create a 25 percent improvement in the plane's fuel economy over comparable models currently in the sky, according to Airbus.

In terms of passenger comfort, the economy seats are a little wider and a little further apart, and it's easier to get down the aisles. The interior design of the cabin can be adapted by individual airlines, depending on how they want to make use of the space (and how many business class passengers they're expecting).

""The design process was about optimisation, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,"" Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the A350 XWB program, told Fast Company. ""We're trying to make the jet relevant for the future. There's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology.""

Qatar Airways is one of the first airlines to introduce an A350 model to its fleet, but other companies have already placed further orders for the aircraft. If you find jetlag a particular problem when flying between countries, you might want to look out for the new plane in the airport schedules. With US$15 billion in funding and 2,600 hours of test flights behind it, the plane is expected to be in service for the next 30 years."
How Much Does an Airbus A380 Cost? - 24/7 Wall St.,"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS8yMDE1LzEyLzI2L2hvdy1tdWNoLWRvZXMtYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtY29zdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How Much Does an Airbus A380 Cost? courtesy of Airbus Group SE

The commercial aircraft division of Airbus has not received a new order for its double-decked, four-engined superjumbo A380 in more than two years. And even though the A380-800 carries a list price of $428 million — the highest for any commercial jet from any manufacturer — the price is probably not the main reason for the worse-than-anemic sales.

The big problem is that Airbus has a single customer for the plane, Emirates, and the airline’s CEO wants Airbus to put new engines on the plane before he’ll order more. A new engine could generate an order for up to 200 of the planes from Emirates and a (much) smaller order from Qatar Airways, which currently has six A380-800s in its fleet and two more on order.

At the end of the third quarter, Airbus reported that its A380 had stopped eating up cash and made a positive contribution to the company’s free cash flow and EBIT. Airbus has a goal of reaching break-even on the A380 by the end of this year. The company had delivered 24 new planes by the end of November and deliveries are secured through 2017.



Even though the A380 is the most expensive plane to purchase, the economics of flying the plane are competitive if the plane is configured to carry about 600 passengers and if the seats are full. The plane’s four engines do not weigh on operating costs much when the plane is stacked up against existing versions of the 777-300ER from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), but when the 777-9X reaches customers in 2020, that could change. Boeing’s 747 is slightly more expensive to operate right now, and Boeing has said that it has no plans to update its largest plane.

The question of the moment is whether Airbus will put new engines on the A380. If it decides not to do so, that decision could spell the end of the superjumbo jet.

"Airbus creates largest 3D printed cabin component, one designed based on human bone structure - USA TODAY","Wed, 02 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTUvMTIvMDIvYWlyYnVzLWNyZWF0ZXMtbGFyZ2VzdC0zZC1wcmludGVkLWNhYmluLWNvbXBvbmVudC1vbmUtZGVzaWduZWQtYmFzZWQtb24taHVtYW4tYm9uZS1zdHJ1Y3R1cmUvODMwNzE1Mzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus creates largest 3D printed cabin component, one designed based on human bone structure

Unless you're leaning against it while you wait for an open lavatory, you might not really think about that partition at the back of an airplane — the nondescript upholstered wall that separates the main cabin from the galley and flight crew's workstation. Yes, that unremarkable-looking divider prevents passengers from watching their inflight entrees being reheated, but it also supports the weight of the flight crew when they're sitting in the jump seats that are attached to it. It's bulky and — each one weighs 143 pounds — which are two words that airline manufacturers hate (passenger comfort are two other words they seem to hate, but we'll save that for another day).

That's why Airbus and engineering software company Autodesk recently turned their combined attention to that partition, redesigning it, cutting its weight by 45% and, in the process, creating the world's largest 3-D printed cabin component. The companies have called it the ""bionic partition,"" because it was designed based not on other aerospace ideas, but on more biological ones: according to Wired, the structural elements of the frame were based on the growth patterns of slime mold and the smaller elements were designed to ""mimic mammalian bone growth,"" a micro-lattice shape that makes it both stronger and lighter than existing partitions.

The new partition would be constructed using an aluminium-magnesium-scandium alloy called Scalmalloy, which was designed for use in 3-D printed products. The completed Scalmalloy partition would weigh 66 pounds, a change that is significant enough to improve the aircraft's carbon emissions. According to Autodesk:

""When applied to the entire cabin and to the current backlog of A320 planes, Airbus estimates that the new design approach can save up to 465,000 metric tons of C02 emissions per year, the equivalent of taking about 96,000 passenger cars off the road for one year.""

The first tests of the partition have already been conducted, and further tests — including an inflight trial — will be conducted next year. Jeff Kowalski, the chief technology officer of Autodesk, said:

“Generative design, additive manufacturing and the development of new materials are already transforming the shape of manufacturing and innovative companies like Airbus are showing what is possible. This is not just an interesting hypothetical experiment – this is a fully functioning component we can expect to see being deployed in aircraft in the very near future.""

So pay your respects to those existing upholstered walls during your next flight. They may not be around much longer."
Etihad Airbus Boeing customer plane won't buy - Business Insider,"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWVuZC1vZi1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWp1bWJvLWpldC0yMDE1LTEy0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90aGUtZW5kLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctanVtYm8tamV0LTIwMTUtMTI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Etihad CEO James Hogan.

Eithad Airways is one of Airbus and Boeing's most important customers.

But the Abu Dhabi-based airline refuses to buy anymore of the respective companies' most expensive flagship models — the four-engined Boeing 747-8I jumbo and the Airbus A380-800 superjumbo.

Two years ago, Etihad placed one of the largest airplane orders is aviation history — 199 jets from Airbus and Boeing, along with engines from Rolls-Royce, GE and CFM to power them.

In total, the order is worth $67 billion.

The order form includes everything from small, short-range airliners to long-range widebody jets to freighters.

But there are no four-engined jumbo jets.

In 2008, Etihad chose the Airbus A380 over Boeing's 747 and placed an order for 10 jets.

Thus far, Airbus has delivered five of the 10 planes, with the rest expected to enter service over the next few years.

Related stories

Even as Etihad CEO James Hogan promotes the airline's new A380 service to New York, the chief executive is reiterating the company's plan to refrain from purchasing anymore four-engined jets in favor of smaller, twin-engined airliners.

""We are taking over 70 Boeing 787s, over 60 Airbus A350s, and we are the launch customer for the next generation Boeing 777,"" Hogan said. ""We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient.""

Currently, Eithad's fellow Middle Eastern airline, Emirates, is lobbying Airbus for an upgraded variant of the A380, with more fuel efficient engines and optimized aerodynamics.

Will an upgraded A380 be enough for Etihad to change its mind?

""No, we're done,"" Hogan reiterated.

Unfortunately for Airbus and Boeing, there are few airlines left with an appetite for its flagship jumbos. In the last eight years, Boeing has sold just 45 747s — the majority of which are to be deployed as heavy freighters.

Earlier this year, Boeing announced it will be cutting back 747 production to just one per month in an attempt to extend the production run and buy the sales team some extra time to generate more orders.

The Airbus A380 isn't doing much better. Since its introduction more than a decade ago, Airbus has sold just 317 A380s with half them to a single customer — Emirates. In fact, Airbus hasn't won an airline order for the double-decker jet since it sold Emirates a batch two years ago.

The demise in popularity of the jumbo jet can be attributed to a change in aviation regulations, airline business models and improvements in jet engine technology.

Traditional aviation thinking dictates that there is safety in numbers. As a result, planes flying long-distance routes were required to have more than two engines— on the off chance one of them fails, there are at least two more to keep the plane going.

Boeing 747-8I. Boeing

These days, with turbofans engines getting much more powerful and reliable, engine failures are becoming increasingly rare. As a result, aviation regulating organizations have now certified fuel-efficient twin-engined jets such as the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A330 to fly the routes traditionally reserved for gas-guzzling jumbos.

In addition, airlines are moving away from the ""hub and spoke"" business model which calls for massive numbers of the passengers to be routed through a single mega-hub. Smaller, fuel efficient jets such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner allow airlines to offer passengers non-stop, point-to-point service without transiting through a hub. But the airlines can still make a profit."
Flying the British Airways Business Class-Only Airbus A318 - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi9icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtYTMxOC1uZXcteW9yay1wcmV0ZW5kaW5nLWxpa2UtcHJpdmF0ZS1qZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to long-haul flying, typically the bigger the aircraft the better. Whether it’s the Boeing 747 or Airbus A380, these are the aircraft typically associated with extreme luxury – private suites, on-board showers, and maybe even a fully stocked bar. Sometimes, though, smaller might actually be better. British Airways operates a pair of tiny Airbus A318s between New York JFK and London City Airport (LCY) with a business class-only configuration featuring only 32 seats (by comparison, Air France carries 131 passengers on their A318s). It sure is a strange (but great) way to fly. To give you a sense of just how small the A318 is, here are some numbers to help size it up: The Airbus A380 sports a total length of 238 feet with a 261-foot wingspan. The A318 is just 103 feet long with a wingspan of just under 112 feet.

I was recently able to fly from JFK to LCY and experience what it’s like flying into London on the A318. Spoiler: It’s wonderful and actually quite a different experience. While the London to New York flight involves a stop in Shannon, Ireland for fuel, the reverse flight is non-stop.

BRITISH AIRWAYS A318 FLIGHT: The Lounge at JFK

The experience begins before the flight at the spacious JFK Terraces Lounge, which features self-service bars (including craft beer on tap!), showers, a spa, and a full buffet-style dinner service. Business class passengers are entitled to a free 15-minute massage at the spa, which was fantastic after a long day of work and a subway ride to the airport. After the massage, I hit the buffet for a delicious meal. For short transatlantic flights (maybe six hours), a true pre-flight meal is a major perk. Dining before the flight enables passengers to maximize their sleep time on board – this is something many airlines still have not figured out. A meal served on the ground is a heck of a lot cheaper than a catered meal on board, so this almost seems like a no-brainer for airlines to offer.

As opposed to the hectic boarding process of a 747, the 32-seat A318 takes just minutes to button up. It’s clear that this particular flight has a number of repeat customers on board, as there were a few “hey Jim” moments where a few passengers just happened to know each other. It even seemed that several passengers had their “preferred” seats on board.

BRITISH AIRWAYS A318 FLIGHT: The Flight

Once aloft, a very quick meal service began for those who didn’t have time (or desire) to eat at the lounge. I resisted the urge and intoxicating smells from the galley, and decided to watch a movie before trying to sleep.

Since this aircraft has no built-in in-flight entertainment, due to weight restrictions, iPads are distributed. No announcement was made that they were available, but thankfully I knew they were offered. Unfortunately, I had to wait quite a while to get mine since the flight attendants were occupied serving dinner.

Propping up the iPad on a tray table, even if it has a case designed to stand on its on, is annoying. The viewing angle is never adequate and they easily fall over. I was frustrated. When I took a quick trip to the lav, I noticed that some passengers had their iPad secured in a very sturdy looking arm. What the?! Somehow, after two entire flights and part of a third, nobody told me that there was a specially designed iPad holder in the center console of the seat. This makes me believe that either the flight crew doesn’t know those holders exist, or simply didn’t care to tell me. Either way, that’s no good.

Once I decided to try to take a nap, the reality of how spacious the A318 Club World seat is over the rest of the British Airways fleet sank in. I actually had flat surfaces to put my things on! There’s even a dedicated “spectacle” holder. I was not really able to sleep on the flight (what else is new), but the seat is plenty comfy for those who can.

Approach to London City is another aspect where the A318 flight sets itself apart from all other flights. Unlike Heathrow, there’s no 30-minute holding pattern before landing. Just a totally awesome 5.5 degree (steep!) approach on the largest aircraft certified to land at London City.

Arrival at London City is a breeze, once again trumping Heathrow. Customs took all of five minutes, and connections to the Docklands Light Railway into the heart of London are super simple. I would be taking a quick detour, however.

BRITISH AIRWAYS A318 FLIGHT: Arriving and Conclusion

Because London City isn’t big enough to house an arrivals lounge, British Airways shuttles passengers in a private car over to the Radisson Blu. Once I arrived, I was set up in one of the hotel’s spa rooms to take a shower, hit the breakfast buffet, and generally get my act together. I must say, it was all quite civilized and very refreshing after a red-eye flight.

It’s clear that the Club World London City service has a very specific target market in mind – those with corporate contracts and super commuters. However, you shouldn’t let that deter you from booking this service if possible. I know I enjoyed the flight and there is probably not a quicker, more efficient way to get across the “pond” than the British Airways A318 flight (well, other than the Concorde, but that is no longer an option).

That is when their bodies readjust to a new time zone once you touch down. But now, commercial aircraft company Airbus and Qatar Airways will introduce an anti-jetlag airbus made from carbon fiber. They have given it the name ‘A350 XWB’ with many improvements.

The chief engineer of the A350 XWB program at Airbus, Alain De Zotti, said, “The design process was about optimization pushing the constraints and opening up the box of solutions.”

It aims to minimize the groggy feeling of traveling halfway around the world. Inside the cabin, they change color to mimic the sun’s natural glow; at the same time, they are designed to fit with our body’s natural circadian rhythms, whatever time it is. It has an air filtering system that refreshes air inside the cabin every 2-3 minutes.

Outside of the anti-jetlag features. Its body is made from 50% carbon fiber reinforced plastic. This technology helps us to get more efficient and lightweight aircraft, minimizing the costs.

It creates a 25% improvement in the plane’s fuel economy with larger and wider wings with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than wind compared to other currently used planes. Due to this latest feature, it could make the rides smoother.

In economy class, the fuselage is wider to accommodate larger passenger seats. The seats are an extra inch wider than the standard width. They can move easily down the aisles because of the seat configuration increase from carrier to carrier and fierce competition for the best business and 1st class cabins.

Over it, De Zotti said, “Business class is now like first class, and first class is like little apartments.”

The carrier can easily swap seats and tweak configuration; that’s why Airbus designed the interior to be adaptable.

De Zotti said, “We are trying to make the jet relevant for the future. There’s an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology.”"
Airbus A350 Slams to a Stop on Botched First Takeoff Out of the U.S. - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9hMTg1NDQvcWF0YXItYWlybGluZXMtYTM1MC1hYm9ydGVkLXRha2VvZmYtamZrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, Qatar Airlines decided to bring one of its new Airbus A350's on a quick trip to the United States to claim the new plane's first official flight to the US. But on its way out of JFK with a load of journalists on board, things went a little off track. As the plane was barreling down the runway, the brakes kicked on and brought the airliner to an abrupt and terrifying halt.

The incident was documented by Zach Honig, Editor-in-Chief for The Points Guy, one of the journalists who was on board the flight. As part of the festivities, Qatar Airlines had an external view of the takeoff streaming to the monitors on the passengers seatbacks and Honig, who was recording that unique viewpoint, also captured the aborted takeoff.

There's not a whole ton to see in the video, but you can hear the brakes hit and see the jolt of the slowdown around 20 seconds in:

As Honig writes onThe Points Guy:

About 18 seconds after we began rolling down JFK's runway 22R, the aircraft self-aborted, bringing us from more than 100 mph to a loud, screeching halt in roughly 15 seconds.

For a plane of this size and weight, stopping that quickly required a lot of force. To give you another idea of how abruptly we stopped ... nearly all of the 200+ pillows and blankets landed on the floor, having previously been neatly arranged on each seat in economy.

According to Honig, the Chief Commercial Officer on the flight explained that an ""indicator"" was the cause of the sudden stop, and that the plane's brakes were engaged when it become clear the 11,000-foot runway was not quite long enough. Meanwhile, Honig and his fellow journalists found themselves essentially trapped on the plane until it attempted another (successful) takeoff. So Qatar Airlines still managed to snap up the milestone it was looking for, but with significantly less finesse than it probably hoped.

Four engines. Four classes. And fewer than four hundred passengers on board — or more than six hundred. That’s the reality of the Airbus A380 as 2015 comes to a close, ten years after the superjumbo first flew.

As early adopters Emirates and Singapore Airlines work through their calculations on what the future of the Airbus A380 looks like, it’s fascinating that the two airlines have reached very different conclusions.

Singapore Airlines’ installation of premium economy on its A380 fleet means that the version with business class throughout the aircraft’s upper deck now holds an impressively light 379 passengers. Previously, the all-biz upper deck version held 409 passengers across suites, business and economy, and was second only to Korean Air’s 407-seat first-business-economy configuration. Compare that with the 414-seater Airbus A330-300 that Philippine Airlines flies.

Emirates, meanwhile, isn’t officially dipping its toes in the premium economy waters, but has the chance to do so with its new two-class 617-seater A380.

Most current A380 configurations continue to hover between 460-520 seats, but my expectation would be for these numbers to gradually fall on a number of carriers for two reasons: better business class seats that require more space and the continued growth of premium economy, which is both linked and separate to the business class growth.

Business class is a growing market, both in terms of demand and in terms of passenger expectations. Direct aisle access is becoming de rigeur, and airlines like Air France, British Airways, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines and Qantas that took their A380s with business class seats that require window or middle seat passengers to clamber over their aisle neighbour to escape will need to meet those evolving expectations — or drop their prices.

We’re already seeing Air France, Korean Air and Qantas moving to a direct aisle access product on other widebody aircraft, ranging from the Zodiac Cirrus outward-facing herringbone seat on Air France to B/E Aerospace’s staggered Apex seat on Korean Air to Thompson’s Vantage XL on Qantas. Even Malaysia Airlines is moving to the slightly more dense regular Vantage seat, with two passengers out of nine in the “clamber or be clambered over” situation.

All of these business class products are less dense than what they’ve been replacing, which will mean that the airlines either have to take space from elsewhere in the aircraft or fly fewer business class seats.

The other factor in the equation is premium economy. As business class seats become more spacious airlines often raise prices, while travel managers are at the same time often offered the (sometimes new) option of premium economy.

Similarly, a clear trend among carriers worldwide is to offer narrower economy class configurations: 3-3-3 on a 787 or 3-4-3 on a 777, for example, even on premium carriers. The proposed 3-5-3 A380 configuration was widely panned when RGN broke the news earlier this year, yet even if it doesn’t materialize there will be a section of the economy market that will pay not to be in the worst seats on the plane, yet won’t pay for a fully flat business class seat with direct aisle access. With few airlines offering the ability to mix fares, there is certainly a segment of passengers on an A380-to-ten-abreast-777 connection that will choose premium economy over regular economy.

Those premium economy seats need to go somewhere, and in both the Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa refits recently, that’s an area formerly devoted to the economy class cabin.

It all boils down to this: with less dense A380s thanks to business class and premium economy demand, and the Airbus calculation that premium economy can be charged at 2x the economy fare while business can be 4x, will the market (and the infrastructure) support more A380s? We’ll be watching to find out."
AirAsia crash blamed on Airbus A320 rudder system problem and pilot error - The Christian Science Monitor,"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jc21vbml0b3IuY29tL1dvcmxkL0FzaWEtUGFjaWZpYy8yMDE1LzEyMDEvQWlyQXNpYS1jcmFzaC1ibGFtZWQtb24tQWlyYnVzLUEzMjAtcnVkZGVyLXN5c3RlbS1wcm9ibGVtLWFuZC1waWxvdC1lcnJvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A rudder control system problem that had occurred 23 times in the previous 12 months coupled with the pilots' response led to last year's crash of an AirAsia plane that killed all 162 people on board, Indonesian investigators said Tuesday.

The National Transportation Safety Committee said an analysis of Flight 8501's data recorder showed the rudder control system had sent repeated warnings to the pilots during the Dec. 28, 2014 flight between the Indonesian city of Surabaya and Singapore.

Aircraft maintenance records for the Airbus A320 showed that problems with the rudder system had been reported 23 times during the year prior to the crash, with nine occurring in December. The investigators said the fault was caused by cracked soldering on an electronic circuit board.

Investigator Nurcahyo Utomo said the problem by itself should not have been dangerous. But after the fourth time an alarm went off during the flight, a crew member apparently went against recommendations and removed a circuit breaker to try to reset the system, he said.

The autopilot became disengaged, and the aircraft began to roll, but no movement was detected on the plane's manual control stick for nine seconds, he said. It then began climbing rapidly before stalling and plummeting into the Java Sea.

Utomo said the voice recorder showed the pilot said ""pull down,"" but in fact the plane was ascending.

""It seemed that there was a miscommunication between the pilot and co-pilot after the fourth fault,"" he said.

The same warnings had occurred three days before the crash with the same pilot, who witnessed a technician on the ground addressing the problem by removing the circuit breaker and then replacing it, according to Utomo and the investigation report.

The last contact the pilots had with air traffic control indicated they were entering stormy weather. They asked to climb from 32,000 feet (9,753 meters) to 38,000 feet (11,582 meters) to avoid threatening clouds, but were denied permission because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the plane dropped off the radar. No distress signal was issued, and investigators said weather conditions did not play a role in the crash.

Earlier reports indicated that the co-pilot was at the controls and the captain had left his seat. “The co-pilot pulled the plane up, and by the time the captain regained the controls it was too late,” one of the people familiar with the investigation said, reported the International Business Times.

""There is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer and the aviation industry,"" tweeted Tony Fernandes, chief executive of the Malaysia-based budget carrier. ""We will not leave any stone unturned to make sure the industry learns from this tragic incident.""

The disappearance of Flight 8501 on Dec. 28, 2014, prompted an intense 17-day international search for the aircraft. The black boxes were located after three Indonesian ships detected two strong pings being emitted from their beacons, about 20 meters (22 yards) apart. The voice recorder captures all conversations between the pilots and with air traffic controllers, as well as any noises heard in the cockpit, including possible alarms or explosions. The flight data recorder saves information on the position and condition of almost every major part in the plane, including altitude, airspeed, direction, engine thrust, the rate of ascent or descent and what up-or-down angle the plane was pointed."
Watch an Airbus A350 go from over 100 mph to 0 mph in under 15 seconds - Yahoo! Voices,"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL3dhdGNoLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLW92ZXItMTAwLW1waC0wLW1waC0yMjIwMzU4NDEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some travel journalists this week got to witness some cutting-edge aviation technology in action, although they probably would have preferred that they hadn’t. During the start of the first Qatar Airways flight from New York on a new Airbus A350, the airplane’s software determined that the runway was too short to take off and decided to put on the brakes, bringing the plane from more than 100 mph to 0 mph in less than 15 seconds.

DON’T MISS: The first ‘Star Trek Beyond’ trailer just leaked

The 36 journalists aboard the plane, who were supposed to enjoy business-class accommodation, recorded their somewhat scary experience on video.

As The Telegraph reports, Qatar Airways will deploy 80 Airbus A350s in the future. The plane “features extra wide cabin, high ceilings and panoramic windows” that have electromechanical shades for switching between transparent and opaque modes.

Rivaling the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in size, the A350 is made of lightweight carbon fiber that’s supposed to save on jet costs.

“As you can see in the video [below], about 18 seconds after we began rolling down JFK’s runway 22R, the aircraft self-aborted, bringing us from more than 100 mph to a loud, screeching halt in roughly 15 seconds,” Zach Honig wrote for The Points Guy.

“For a plane of this size and weight, stopping that quickly required a lot of force. To give you another idea of how abruptly we stopped, as you can see in the picture below, nearly all of the 200+ pillows and blankets landed on the floor, having previously been neatly arranged on each seat in economy,” he said.

“Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but some passengers (including myself) were quite shaken.”

The plane took off from a different runway some two hours later, making a safe trip to Doha. The aborted take-off video follows below.

Qatar Airways currently flies to 152 destinations around the world, including New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Washington, D.C.

The airline plans to open routes from Doha to Los Angeles in January, Boston in March, and Atlanta in June.

The Persian Gulf-based airline has grown rapidly over the past decade and now boasts a fleet of 168 aircraft. In addition, Qatar has another 330 jets on order, which are valued at more than $70 billion.

Qatar's success has not come without pitfalls. American, United, and Delta Air Lines have accused Qatar along with Etihad Airways and Emirates of fueling its palatial terminals, luxury service, and massive fleets with $42 billion in government subsidies.

Airbus

Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad deny these accusations. The coalition of US airlines has petitioned the US State Department to reevaluate the ""Open Skies"" agreements between the US and the Gulf states that allow airlines to fly freely between the countries.

Al Baker told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that whatever money his airline had received from the Qatari government had been in the form of investment in exchange for equity.

Etihad CEO James Hogan echoed Al Baker's sentiments, telling Business Insider: ""At the end of the day. We have a shareholder who placed equity in the airline who gave us loans to be repaid. That's what people do when they invest in the business.""

Qatar is the launch partner for the Airbus A350-900 twin-engine long-range airliner. The airline expects to have eight of the jets in its fleet by the end of the year, with 72 more on order. The A350 fleet is currently deployed only on routes to Germany and Singapore.

The A350 is powered by two powerful and efficient Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan engines. The jet can carry as many as 325 passengers in three different classes, with a fuel range of about 8,700 miles."

Airbus saves weight with 'bionic partition' - Professional Engineering,"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXNhdmVzLXdlaWdodC13aXRoLSdiaW9uaWMtcGFydGl0aW9uJ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Articles

Airbus has almost halved the weight of the partitions it uses to separate sections inside its A320 aircraft by using a combination of “generative” design techniques and 3D printing.

If used in all of the A320 aircraft on order at Airbus, the partition, which is 30kg lighter than current designs, could save around 465,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.

The partition, which is also the world’s largest 3D printed airplane cabin component, has been developed over five years with Autodesk using the software company's generative design technique.

Generative design uses algorithms and cloud computing to generate hundreds of thousands of design alternatives to meet specific goals and constraints.

The unusual lattice design generated mimics cellular structure and bone growth, instead of the honeycomb structure used in the current partitions, to produce a structure that is both stronger and lighter. The bionic partition meets all the design and structural requirements, including specific cutouts and weight limits.

Jeff Kowalski, chief technology officer of Autodesk, said: “Generative design, additive manufacturing and the development of new materials are already transforming the shape of manufacturing and innovative companies like Airbus are showing what is possible. This is not just an interesting hypothetical experiment – this is a fully functioning component we can expect to see being deployed in aircraft in the very near future.”

The wall is made from Scalmalloy, a second-generation aluminium-magnesium-scandium alloy powder developed specifically by Airbus for 3D printing laser sintering machines. The metal has many of the properties of aluminium, but stretches more before breaking.

Peter Sander, vice president of emerging technologies and concepts, Airbus, said: “The collaboration has proved very successful. These technologies will ultimately revolutionise the way we design and build aircraft, enabling improvements in fuel efficiency, passenger comfort and a drastic reduction in the environmental footprint of air transport overall.”

Laboratory crash tests of the new partition are scheduled for next month and the first flight tests for the new 'bionic' partition are scheduled for next year."

AGS is a NATO program to establish a NATO-owned and operated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering capability including five Global Hawk unmanned aircraft for airborne sensing; a ground segment of fixed, transportable, and mobile general ground stations; and a support segment.

The MGGS aim to exploit radar images acquired by the Global Hawks via a direct or satellite broadband connection. Data from all interoperable command, control and ISR (C2ISR) systems operated by NATO member states can also be received and evaluated.

“The exploitation results will provide information about stationary and moving objects on the ground to the local unit’s commander and can be distributed as well within NATO forces,” Airbus said in a statement.

Each MGGS is housed in two containers that are transportable by truck, aircraft, train, or ship, Airbus said.

MGGS delivery will begin by year’s end and all six will be delivered to the NATO base in Sigonella, Italy. After initial delivery, the stations can be redeployed to NATO operating units as required.

Airbus first presented the first complete MGGS in the company’s Friedrichshafen, Germany facility to representatives of NATO, the 15 nations involved in the program, and prime system contractor Northrop Grumman [NOC].

MGGS development involves 11 international industrial partners from Germany, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia."
"Touring American's A321T — First, Business and Economy - The Points Guy","Thu, 31 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL3RvdXJpbmctYW1lcmljYW4tYTMyMXQtZmlyc3QtYnVzaW5lc3MtYW5kLWVjb25vbXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American is in fierce competition with Delta, JetBlue and United to become the reigning lie-flat champion between New York and San Francisco/Los Angeles — so we asked TPG Contributor Kevin Song, an AAdvantage Executive Platinum elite, to take a closer look at the carrier's Airbus A321T, the only aircraft to offer a three-class configuration on these domestic transcon routes.

Earlier this year, I flew on American's A321T from Los Angeles (LAX)-New York-JFK, bumping myself from business to first with a systemwide upgrade. Having already flown economy and business on this route, this flight was my chance to check out American's transcon first — and I even had a brief stint flying way up front.

As boarding commenced on board the A321T from LAX-JFK, I was graciously invited to try out the one seat I hadn't yet experienced on this aircraft: the captain's seat!

SAAver Redemptions for the A321T

Average one-way prices for transcon routes aboard American's A321T are about $1,900 in first class, $1,600 in business and $240 in economy. Since the routes span about 2,500 miles' worth of the continental United States, though, they make for a great mileage redemption value. SAAver level award seats on the A321T can be difficult to find, but if you're lucky, you can redeem for 12,500 AAdvantage miles each way in economy, 25,000 each way in business or 32,500 each way in first class (these amounts will increase on March 22, 2016).

American's A321T features a three-cabin configuration, including this first-class cabin.

First Class

First class aboard the A321T has 10 lie-flat seats in a 1-1 configuration of five rows. Each seat has 62 inches of pitch and is 21 inches wide, with a bed length of 82.5 inches. Though it's the only first class you'll find on a domestic transcon route, it doesn't afford you all that much unless you 1) want a slightly improved meal service over transcon business and/or 2) really hate sitting next to someone. In fact, if you're traveling with a companion on this route, I'd highly recommend you opt for business class, as you'll be able to talk to him or her much more easily.

To read more about what it's like to actually fly first class on the A321T, be sure to see TPG's review.

The only real reason to book first class is if you really need the extra privacy and uninterrupted sleep.

The seat really is above and beyond most domestic products — in fact, the first-class seat here is actually pretty much identical to the well-touted business class seat on American's internationally configured Boeing 777-300ER (77W). For additional privacy, each first-class seat is angled away from the aisle and toward the windows.

The seat features a nice space to keep drinks and other personal items, as well as a large personal entertainment screen.

The at-seat space is large enough that you won't need to move your drinks and personal items each time you want to get up. To the left, there's a console with a power plug, AV ports, USB connectors and a seat control where you can adjust and recline. The main 15.4-inch personal entertainment screen pops out, so it needs to be stowed during take-off and landing, and a smaller fixed secondary entertainment screen can be used to control your media without reaching toward the touch screen.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

The seats are high enough to have quite a bit of privacy from people walking past you in the aisle.

At the foot of the seat, you'll find an ottoman, as well as a cubby that's large enough to store shoes, a small bag, your comforter, etc. I was able to stretch out comfortably, but I'm not particularly tall — taller people might have some issues.

Fly your pets in a little more comfort in the A321T's first-class pet cabin.

I flew this route four times over the spring and summer and on each flight, first class was filled with children and families — though this might very well be related to school vacation schedules. I never did see an animal on board, even though the A321T's first class includes a ""pet cabin."" In reality, this is merely an unpadded closet with an air vent and oxygen mask — more utilitarian than luxurious. The flight attendants on this particular flight weren't even aware this space was intended for pets until I pointed out the oxygen mask in the compartment.

Business Class

The A321T's business class has 20 seats in 2-2 configuration of five rows. Each seat has 58 inches of pitch and is about 19 inches wide, with a bed length of between 75 and 78 inches. More comfortable than private, each business-class seat is angled away from the center, so when you're slightly reclined, you can't directly see your neighbor. The A321T's business class offers the same amenity kit, Bose headphones, personal entertainment screen, connectivity ports and power outlets as you'll find in the A321T's first class.

The business class cabin is really comfy and a wonderful way to cross the country.

Each business-class seat has its own 15.4-inch fixed-screen personal entertainment system that can be used for the entire flight, including during take-off and touchdown. There isn't quite as much at-seat space to store personal belongings as you'll find around the first-class seat, but there's an area designed to hold your smartphone and a small shelf under the entertainment screen where you can keep something small like a book or digital tablet.

You're seated next to another passenger, but the seat is recessed enough to be able to not have to look directly at the other person.

Having now flown both business and first on this aircraft, I feel there's not much reason to pay for the A321T's first class. I'd only consider splurging on first if I was dead set on avoiding possible interaction with my fellow passengers for the entire trip.

Unlike in first class, passengers in business have pretty much no privacy from people walking past in the aisle.

The A321T's business class certainly offers less privacy than its first class — the walls around the seat aren't particularly high, so people walking in the aisle can easily see everything you do — but the seat itself is really comfy and has all the bells and whistles I'd look for in first class.

Be sure to check out Eric Rosen's business class review on the A321T for more details.

Economy Class — Main Cabin and Main Cabin Extra

The A321T's economy cabin includes 72 new slimline seats — 36 premium-economy Main Cabin Extra and 36 standard-economy Main Cabin. Both types of economy seats are 18 inches wide, but Main Cabin seats have between 31-32 inches of pitch, while Main Cabin Extra offers about five extra inches of legroom.

The economy cabin on the A321T is actually pretty short, with only 12 rows. Half of the seats are designated as Main Cabin Extra.

Rather than a separate class of service, Main Cabin Extra is preferred seating that you can either purchase (on transcon flights, we're talking about $100 additional each way), or receive as an elite benefit. Beyond extra legroom and Group 1 boarding, there are exactly zero service differences between Main Cabin and Main Cabin Extra — but on a nearly six-hour flight, those five inches of extra legroom can be really beneficial.

To see what it's like to fly in these Main Cabin Extra seats, be sure to see my A321T JFK-LAX review.

Just about the only difference between Main Cabin Extra and the regular Main Cabin is legroom — but that's a pretty major difference.

Though the seatback pockets of the new slimline Main Cabin seats are able to hold less than the old seats, they're designed to be more durable and allow you to easily see your personal items.

The bulkhead row has virtually unlimited legroom, so if you're exceptionally tall, it's a great option. As with all bulkheads, though, you sacrifice the ability to place items underneath the seat in front of you, and your tray table will be in the armrest, slightly reducing your seat width.

If you want the most legroom of any seat in the Main Cabin, choose the bulkhead seats with unlimited legroom.

All seats in the Main Cabin and Main Cabin Extra feature power outlets, 8.9-inch seatback touch-screens and in-flight entertainment systems — though be aware that even in Main Cabin Extra, entertainment isn't free. Underneath each seat is an entertainment/media box that takes up a considerable amount of room, so it's unlikely that you'll be able to use this space to store a larger carry-on.

Each Main Cabin seat offers AC power, as well as for-pay personal entertainment screens.

Bottom Line

American's new Airbus A321T is a pretty awesome plane, and the only aircraft to feature a three-cabin configuration on domestic transcontinental routes. Each cabin has a very distinct feel, but the negligible differences between first and business class might not be enough to justify the increased cost.

After flying on this plane and route in all three cabins, I plan to fly only its business class in the future, which I feel delivers a good balance between cost and comfort. Plus, on light travel days, AAdvantage Executive Platinum elites have access to complimentary upgrades to business and other elites can use 500-mile upgrades just as they would on any other domestic route.

Airbus's clever new planes are designed to help you beat jet lag - Yahoo! Voices,"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL2FpcmJ1cy1jbGV2ZXItcGxhbmVzLWRlc2lnbmVkLWhlbHAtYmVhdC1qZXQtbGFnLTEzMjA1MDE4Mi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One thing frequent fliers hate most is jet lag, but Airbus is taking steps to help them adjust to new time zones faster than before. The new A350 XWB line of jets features several design elements aimed to ease jet lag and improve the customer’s onboard overall experience.

DON’T MISS: This fan theory explains who the new Star Wars villain might really be

According to Quartz, Airbus spent $15 billion developing the new A350 XWB, with the first models being already used by Qatar Airways.

Airbus figured out various features to trick our bodies to adapt faster to a new time zone, such as light adjustment. The company equipped the A350 XWB with special LED lighting that changes color temperature during the flight to mimic the light from the sun. That way, the body should better adapt to the changes in light, and, thus produce melatonin earlier than it’s supposed to, thus preparing passengers for a good night’s sleep at the appropriate time after they land.

The system is apparently capable of producing 16.7 million different light color combinations that can be adapted to any flight length or change of time zones.

The new A350 XWB also has better air than other planes. Research has shown that changes in pressure and low humidity exacerbate jet lag. The new plane has a frame made in part (53%) from strong but lightweight carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, a higher proportion than on any other previous model. In addition to making the A350 XWB more fuel efficient, the design helps out with humidity.

Because it’s not made of aluminum, the plane is less prone to corrosion, which means humidity isn’t a problem. The airplane can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, closer to the pressure on the ground, and an altitude that allows for more humidity in the air.

The new filtration system in the plane turns over the air every two to three minutes, which should improve overall air and sleep quality.

Finally, the plane offers bigger seats even in economy – one inch wider than other aircraft – and has a wing design inspired by bird wings that is supposed to reduce noise.

It’s yet to be determined whether Airbus’ new measures to fight jet lag will actually work, but the new A350 XWB design choices and features to mitigate jet lag are certainly interesting.

Aircraft designers have always been quite good at using every spare inch of space that they can, and modern CAD software is making that easier for them than ever before. Software now exists that can help airplane designers optimize the structural design of aircraft to use the absolute minimum material possible to create safe and durable structures while taking up as little usable space as possible.

At Autodesk University 2015 held this week in Las Vegas the company showed off the results of their collaboration with Airbus to use auto-generative design to create what they’re calling the world’s largest 3D printed airplane cabin structural component. Using Autodesk generative design algorithms, Airbus created a new dividing wall that separates the main passenger seating area with the plane’s galley and flight attendant jumpseats. Airbus called the new dividing wall a “bionic partition” because its internal structure mimics biological structures created in nature.

Generative design, or auto-generative design as it is sometimes called, is a structure or object that is designed entirely by computer software to mimic natural cellular and bone structures. How it works is actually pretty amazing; the user, or designer, simply enters in a series of constraints and structural necessities, for instance how much of a load the object needs to be able to support or what the object needs to do. Once the software has that data it uses a cloud-based algorithm that computes huge amounts of alternative designs until it finds one that meets all of the desired structural requirements using the least amount of material possible to do so.

Not only does generative design result in stronger and more structurally sound objects, but they use less material so the objects are much lighter than traditionally designed objects. If the object being generated is an architectural component, then they often end up saving considerable space as well. Obviously design technology like this is perfect for businesses that place a high value on reducing weight and materials usage, but it is also ideal for a wide range of industries. Auto-generative design can be used to design everything from furnishings to homes to medical implants designed and optimized to be as nonintrusive as possible based on individual patients’ bodies.

“Generative design, additive manufacturing and the development of new materials are already transforming the shape of manufacturing and innovative companies like Airbus are showing what is possible. This is not just an interesting hypothetical experiment – this is a fully functioning component we can expect to see being deployed in aircraft in the very near future. We’re looking forward to further collaboration with Airbus on new components and designs for current and future aircraft,” said Autodesk chief technology officer Jeff Kowalski.

The concept is based on how nature creates structures that are not overly complicated and maximize material and composition. If you think of the inside of a human bone, it has cavities, gaps and holes that may seem random, but they actually help the human body perform better. A completely solid bone would be twice as heavy, putting more strain on the body’s musculature while also paradoxically offering less durability. A solid bone will snap when exposed to certain pressures, but a bone with internal porous gaps can survive greater pressures because the gaps act as structural supports that push against the pressure rather than simply crack.

The final design of the “bionic partition” is essentially impossible to create using traditional manufacturing and fabrication technologies. Not only does it have a large, organic shape that would be hard to cast or machine, but the wall also has small-scale micro geometries that provide extra structural support and strength while reducing its weight and material use. Airbus turned to 3D printing to create the structure using the large-scale Concept Laser M2 metal 3D printer with an advanced metal material from APWorks.

Airbus assembled the partition for the first time at the Autodesk University event, and confirmed that the final, assembled partition weighs 45% less than the current design. They estimate that using this new design process on their airplanes could save up to 465,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions every year. That is the equivalent of removing 96,000 cars from the road in the same time period. Airbus says that they will continue testing the Autodesk generative design process, and they could have components and parts made with the process available for commercial use as early as 2018.

Microflite Helicopter Services is welcoming the 14th Airbus Helicopter rotorcraft to its fleet.

The latest addition, an H125 (formerly AS350 B3e), is destined to help safeguard thousands of lives, providing enhanced capability to the company’s front-line emergency response work, ranging from aerial firefighting to search and rescue and disaster recovery.

Speaking after a Nov. 26 delivery, Microflite’s managing director, Jonathan Booth, praised Airbus Group Australia Pacific’s Civil Helicopters team for rising to the challenge of meeting a five-month deadline of supplying a customized aircraft, outfitted with everything from dual hydraulics to emergency floats, a cargo hook and wire-strike protection system.

He said timing was critical in the lead-up to Australia’s fire season.

“We are well prepared for the coming season and this additional Airbus Helicopters aircraft will provide even greater capability and fleet redundancy,” said Booth, who, with his father, purchased the company 10 years ago.

He said the company’s “strong partnership” with Airbus Helicopters was integral to its growth.

“We see it very much as a partnership because when we go for our contracts and tenders, and we put our best foot forward, we only tender Airbus Helicopters products and, in doing so, we commit to the safety management systems and maintenance programs built around these aircraft.”"

"Airbus Enlists Autodesk to Design Mold-Inspired, 3D Printed Aircraft Partition - 3D Printing Industry","Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzYzMDQ2LTYzMDQ2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A few years back, when Airbus put out its video detailing a concept for a 3D printed airliner, it seemed pretty outlandish. Since then, both the industry as a whole and Airbus have made developments that make that vision a bit less absurd. While numerous large-scale 3D printers have made public appearances, 3D printing structures big enough to be assembled into complete buildings and Sciaky’s enormous EBAM machines have gone on the market, Airbus has already flown numerous 3D printed parts, including the largest ever to hit the skies. And they’ve added yet another large part to their 3D printed repertoire.

To further lighten the load of their aircraft, Airbus turned to Autodesk to design lightweight partition for their cabins, used to separate classes and the flight crew. Unveiled at Autodesk University in Las Vegas, the new and improved design was not only significantly less bulky than existing partitions, but was more organic as well, based of the growth of slime molds and bones. 3D printing these structures, sound enough to hold the weight of flight attendants, the company was able to reduce the weight from 143 pounds down to 66. Bastian Schaefer, innovation manager at Airbus, said of the design process, “Our goal was to reduce the weight by 30 percent, and we altogether achieved weight reduction by 55 percent. And we’re right at the beginning.”

The design for the Bionic Partition was created by David Benjamin, whose innovative The Living architecture practice takes cues from nature to create structures. For the larger structure of the piece, which Benjamin describes as the “macro frame”, the architect mimicked the growth of the slime mold, capable of forming strong connections between two points. And the “micro frame”, making up the design components within the outer frame, were modeled after mammalian bone growth, more delicate grid structures. Setting the parameters in this way, he was then able to rely on Autdoesk’s powerful Dreamcatcher software to generate the rest, saying, With these algorithms in place, Benjamin and Airbus could define parameters for the partition and let the software do its thing. “We can generate literally tens of thousands of design iterations, compared with the manual process which could generate maybe a dozen.”

Not only does the final product require less of the Scalmalloy (an aluminum, magnesium, and scandium alloy), but it is optimized to support the necessary weight, something that would be extremely difficult for a designer to create without software, Benjamin says. “A human might make something where, if you wanted to connect all the points, you would start at the perimeter, or start at the center and draw spokes,” the architect explains. “It’s hard for a human with a rule-based brain to think of the complexity of connecting local neighborhoods, but also connecting the whole. The slime mold type of connectivity is a really fascinating way to connect two points.”

The partition has since gone through the standard tests necessary for manufacturing aircraft parts, with plans to incorporate the components in aircraft as soon as next year. If successful, Airbus may apply the same generative approach in larger parts of an airplane. When the entire aircraft itself will be 3D printed is TBA, but Schaefer says, “This is still the goal, to be able to print an entire airplane, or large components of it.”

Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Autodesk Within was used for this project, when, in actuality, it was Autodesk Dreamcatcher."

Dramatic video shows a historic Qatar Airways flight slamming to a halt on the runway — and concerned passengers squirming in their seats due to the aborted takeoff.

The first Airbus A350 flight from the United States contained journalists and other guests. Zach Honig, editor in chief of the travel website thepointsguy.com, recorded video as the plane streaked along a JFK Airport runway at more than 100 miles per hour before the plane self-aborted, bringing the aircraft to a halt.

The abrupt stop sent pillows and blankets scattering across the floor, Honig reported.

“Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but some passengers (including myself) were quite shaken,” he wrote later.

Qatar Airlines’ first commercial A350 flight from the United States featured an aborted takeoff.

A man came over the loudspeakers to calm the passengers. A flight attendant, meanwhile, asked Honig to “please switch off the camera.”

He kept recording the video and later posted it to YouTube, and it’s drawn hundreds of thousands of views.

“As I understand it, for some reason the A350 decided that our 11,000-foot runway was too short to support the takeoff, and the plane applied the brakes at full force — all on its own,” Honig wrote.

An Airbus A350 and A380 are pictured at the Airbus delivery site Sept. 25 in Blagnac, before their delivery to Qatar.

The pilots later took off on a different runway, and the plane continued to Doha, the capital city of Qatar.

Qatar Airways last week became the first company to fly the Airbus A350 to the United States. The new flight route coincides with a global brand campaign and tagline, “Going Places Together.” Airline officials were not immediately available for comment Monday.

Airbus Operations has shed some light on the business challenges of calling time on a long-standing IT contract, after moving away from an outsourcing deal with HP.

Speaking at the Gartner Datacentre, Infrastructure and Operations Management Summit in central London, the aircraft manufacturer’s head of hosting services, Peter Radig, said the decision to wind down its 12-year contract with HP was made two weeks after he joined the firm in 2012.

“The contract with HP was 12 years old and was renewed three times, with exclusive negotiations that led to a very difficult contractual situation, as well as a weak operational situation, because as that grew we never changed the definition of the statement of work,” he said.

This also led to the emergence of some accountability grey areas, as situations arose where neither HP nor internal staff at Airbus knew who should intervene when problems occurred.

“We had a situation where HP would say this is done internally, and someone else would say it was done by HP. It was very uncomfortable,” he said.

Starting over To resolve this, the company decided a fresh start was needed and issued a request for proposals (RFP), the overarching aim of which was to reduce some of the operational complexity that had developed within the Airbus IT estate over the years. At the time, Airbus was operating 12,500 servers, all of which would need to be migrated over to a new provider, as well as 2,900 databases and around 670 applications. All of this IT contributes towards the creation of its aircraft, which can – in the case of its A320 vehicle – take up to nine years to build using more than 2.5 million parts procured from around 16,000 suppliers, Radig explained. To steer the company through the RFP and tendering process, it enlisted the help of a third-party sourcing advisor, ISG. “We wanted to send a strong signal to the market that we were serious this time. We didn’t have the best reputation in the market [when it came to procurement] as we would always ask for an RFP and then get people to work to that, and then enter into exclusive negotiations with HP,” he said. Having ISG there meant prospective suppliers also had an independent party they could quiz and seek assurances from about the sincerity of Airbus’s intentions, said Radig. “We also wanted to include benchmarks in the contract, but had no idea how to put those in, and – finally – the time schedule we were working to didn’t allow for an in-house way of working,” he added."

Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first Swedish NH90 in full anti-submarine warfare (ASW) configuration to the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration FMV (Försvarets Materielverk).

The fully-qualified rotorcraft has an entirely customized mission system including underwater sonar, tactical radar and high cabin for improved interior space.

“In terms of versatility and customizability, the Swedish NH90 ASW demonstrates the benefits of an integrated, highly powerful, fly-by-wire helicopter platform”, said Wolfgang Schoder, head of light and governmental programs at Airbus Helicopters.

“Specially tailored for its maritime missions and the operative environment in the Baltic Sea, this helicopter is best-suited for the customer’s requirements.”

In total, Sweden has ordered 18 NH90, 13 equipped for search-and-rescue missions (SAR) and five in ASW configuration. In the frame of today’s delivery, FMV and the manufacturer NHIndustries have also signed a contract to modify four already delivered NH90 from SAR to ASW configuration, bringing the total Swedish NH90 fleet to nine ASW and nine SAR aircraft.

Prior to delivery, the aircraft has been thoroughly tested by the Swedish acceptance team in Donauwörth and over water in Marignane.

Several military services around the globe are already operating the NH90 in search and rescue, tactical transport, ASW or surveillance missions over sea.

“With 260 NH90s already delivered to 13 different nations and nearly 100,000 flying hours in operation, this combat-proven helicopter is now confirming its worth at the hands of the most demanding customers around the globe.” said Schoder.

Management of the NH90 program is handled by the NHIndustries consortium, which is owned by Airbus Helicopters (62.5 percent), AgustaWestland (32 percent), and Stork Fokker (5.5 percent)."
A Space-Flex setback: carrier chooses comfort for crew - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTIvYS1zcGFjZS1mbGV4LXNldGJhY2stY2Fycmllci1jaG9vc2VzLWNvbWZvcnQtZm9yLWNyZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year RGN learned that a major carrier was evaluating the Airbus/Zodiac Space-Flex v2 lavatory/galley option and had less than stellar overall impressions of the product. The airline suggested that “no group other than finance was enthusiastic about it”. RGN has now confirmed that for this airline, “Zodiac space galley for the A320 has been killed, at least for the time being.”

While Zodiac and Airbus – partners on V2 – may be disappointed to lose out on the order for 100+ cabin retrofits, the move should keep passengers and inflight crew happy. And both parties are significant when it comes to such decisions.

Most of the objections previously disclosed to RGN about the Space-Flex v2 offering were related to catering and crew safety challenges. Interestingly, Delta Air Lines recently acknowledged that certain changes to its cabin configurations were bad for the crew and the carrier is reversing course. This was the first significant public nod to the importance of recognizing crew needs in cabin layout decisions, and a good reminder that such considerations are part of the process. Clearly other airlines are thinking similarly.

But the decision may also be tied to limiting capacity growth. Most larger airlines today are pursuing a path of limited capacity growth, particularly in the markets served by A320 family aircraft. JetBlue is, for instance, adding some seats to its A320s, likely through installation of the Space-Flex v2 arrangement together with newer, slimline seats. But even with this move JetBlue is keeping a generous seat pitch in economy (33″) and not adding the maximum number of seats to its aircraft. Likewise, other airlines control capacity in this fashion.

In unrelated news, Zodiac is separately facing delays in delivering toilets to the Airbus A350 XWB program, Reuters reports. It’s the latest challenge to afflict the company. Zodiac has grappled with supply chain constraints unique to the firm, including a strike last fall at its Gainesville, Texas plant formerly known as Weber, which led to the delay of thousands of aircraft seats. In September, American Airlines announced it is sourcing a new vendor to supply Business Class seats for its Boeing 787-9 aircraft and the remainder of its Boeing 777-200 retrofit aircraft, as a result of the chronic delays at Zodiac.

In releasing its fiscal first quarter earnings results this week, Zodiac assured it is continuing to implement its transformation plan, called Focus, “which will help improve operational and financial performance”. This plan, added Zodiac, “is designed to enable the Group to draw lessons from the crisis that affected the Group’s Aircraft Interiors activities in 2014/2015.”"
France orders eight Airbus A330 MRTTs | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZnJhbmNlLW9yZGVycy1laWdodC1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1tcnR0cy8xMTkxNDkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France has ordered eight Airbus Defence & Space A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTT), from an eventual requirement for 12 of the type worth a total €3 billion ($3.3 billion).

Paris had already committed to one example in June, with the remainder to be signed for by 2018. The initial aircraft is expected to be delivered to the French air force in in 2018, with further handovers of one or two per year until 2025.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, the French MRTTs will carry both an Airbus refuelling boom system and underwing hose-and-drogue refuelling pods. They can also be reconfigured to carry 271 passengers as a transport aircraft.

Additionally, in a medical evacuation role, the aircraft will be equipped with the Morphee intensive care module, which can carry 10 patients and 88 passengers.

Airbus says seven nations have ordered the type – Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the UK – with 49 ordered and 26 delivered.

In April, President Francois Hollande announced that the nation's defence budget would increase by €3.8 billion between 2016 and 2020, to counter the threat from Islamic extremism. The French air force has, since September, been conducting offensive operations in Syria against Islamic State, extending the remit of its Operation Chammal, which seeks to counter the rise of the terrorist organisation.

That operation, alongside commitments in Africa, has increased demand on France's aircraft fleet.

Paris has been the target of multiple terrorist attacks in 2015, with the most recent taking place on 13 November.

Flying Economy on a Turkish Airlines Airbus A321 - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 04 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi9mbHlpbmctZWNvbm9teS10dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of our honeymoon trip, we managed to stretch one award ticket into eight segments around Europe. It took some research, but if you know the rules, you can push the limits and get the most value for your hard-earned miles and points.

This flight from Istanbul (IST) to Vienna (VIE) was the first leg of our European tour. We had previously flown from San Francisco via Paris on Air France, connecting to a regional Air France flight to Istanbul. After spending a whopping one night in Istanbul, it was time to head out for the next leg of our whirlwind journey on a Turkish Airlines Airbus A321.

Airline: Turkish Airlines

Aircraft: Airbus A321-200 (321) – 194 seats (Euro-style variable Business/Economy seating configuration)

Departed: Istanbul Ataturk Airport (IST)

Arrived: Vienna International Airport (VIE)

Class: Economy

Seats: 7D, 7F

Flight TK1887 | IST-VIE Departure Time Arrival Time Flight Time Scheduled 5:10pm 6:05pm 1:55 Actual 5:37pm 6:28pm 1:51 +/- +0:27 +0:23 -0:04

We arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport approximately two hours from departure on the Havatas bus, which drops us off on the departures level; we had to get upstairs to the check-in counters. To even enter the International Terminal building, every passenger and visitor must clear a security screening as thorough as a regular airport checkpoint, so sometimes these lines can back up. This is in addition to the passport control and secondary security checkpoint to get to the the boarding gates.

The entrance closest to the Turkish counters was backed up, so we found another entrance that had no line, and effortlessly entered the check-in area.

Pro tip: At many airports, there are multiple entrances to the secured area. If one checkpoint is crowded, ask if there may be another less crowded one you can use.

Not having elite status with any Star Alliance carrier, we would have to travel as mere muggles on this trip, but fortunately the lines for economy check-in weren’t long. With no bags to check, we grabbed our boarding passes and headed towards passport control and the secondary security check. We passed through in under five minutes, without having to take our shoes off!

Immediately beyond passport control, the duty-free shopping area greeted us with its wide array of items just begging to be taken home. From the typical liquors and fragrances, to local delicacies like Turkish delight and baklava (free samples!), temptation abounded.

We initially went to the gate indicated on the departures board, but upon arrival it showed that our flight had switched to another gate farther down the concourse. No harm, we continued another few hundred feet and at last reached our darkened departure gate, with no flight information posted on the screen. While it was a sunny day, all the interior lights in the area were off, which made the area dim. Coupled with the lack of adequate air conditioning, it suggested that the airport was on some sort of energy saving plan, which during a hot summer day did not a happy passenger make.

The ground staff didn’t arrive until 20 minutes prior to departure, and the aircraft didn’t appear until five minutes prior… yet everyone claimed that the flight was still on-time! Of course I knew better and started wandering around.

Thirty minutes past our scheduled departure time, boarding was announced for our flight. Turkish uses roped lanes, with business class and elites boarding first, then by economy sections starting with the rear third of the cabin. The lanes remained empty until the boarding announcement was made, after which the passengers dutifully queued up in their respective lanes… very controlled and organized. There was a preboarder, which highlighted IST’s unique motorized wheelchair for disabled guests where the attendant actually stands and drives the chair like a powered trolley.

Turkish equips its Airbus A321s with a convertible Euro-style cabin, where all the seats are economy, but the first rows can be converted to business class seating by blocking the middle seat and moving a dividing curtain between the sections. We boarded one of their Star Alliance-liveried aircraft and took our seats in row 7, which is within the convertible section, however our flight only had three rows of business configured for this trip. Since the flight wasn’t full, we had reserved seats 7D and 7F, hoping that the middle seat would stay open (which it was, though we didn’t want to receive the crews ire by flipping down the center armrests). The legroom was average, with about three inches of room between my knees and the seatback in front of me.

Pro Tip: For a potentially more comfortable flight, reserve your seats with an empty middle. If it ends up being occupied, you will very likely be able to barter with that passenger for one of your window or aisle seats.

Right after the door closed, the flight attendants came through and handed out piece of Turkish delight candy to each passenger – a very nice and unique touch. Naturally, I dropped mine; the wrapper saved my piece, but powdered sugar covered my shoe. It was still tasty (the candy, not my shoe).

Shortly after, menu cards and complimentary earbuds were handed out, while in front of the curtain I spied an onboard chef serving dinner to the business class passengers. After a standard beverage service for coach passengers, the chef came to the back to help with the meal service. I’d be lying if I said having my food tray handed to me by a guy in a chef’s hat didn’t make me chuckle.

I’m old enough to remember hot meals in coach in the US, so Turkish having a full meal service made our flight very pleasant, especially for a flight under two hours. The pasta was a little soft, but the rosemary cream sauce was delicious. I liked the curried chicken with rice more; the curry flavor was more subtle than overpowering. Both entrees came with an okay potato salad and a good chocolate mousse for dessert. All in all, a decent airplane meal.

In short order, we arrive into a hazy Vienna International Airport. A quick taxi, short line for passport control, and we’re heading into the city for the next chapter of our adventure…

Turkey suspended the flights of the two A400Ms delivered by the Airbus Group, the plane's manufacturer, after an A400M crashed near Sevilla, Spain, last year.

Turkish officials said the two aircraft were sent to Airbus for retrofit work and reinforced software work.

The officials said A400M flights will resume in January.

In 2003, Turkey signed a deal for a batch of 10 A400Ms, with final deliveries scheduled for 2018.

A400M deliveries to Turkey have faced some delays, sparking a dispute between Airbus and the Turkish government. Turkey accused Airbus for failing in its delivery timetable, and Airbus accused Turkey of using delays for bargaining.

Other A400M client nations are Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Spain and Britain.

"The AirAsia Crash That Killed 162 Was ""Utterly Preventable"" - Popular Mechanics","Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9uZXdzL2ExODM3OC90aGUtYWlyLWFzaWEtODUwMS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Indonesian investigator has concluded that a cascading series of technical failures, compounded by crew error, brought down an Indonesian AirAsia jetliner nearly a year ago. The crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 killed 162 people on December 28, 2014.

Related Story Debris from AirAsia Jet Found in Indonesian Waters

According to sources we talked to, this deadly crash could have been prevented—a fact that won't do much to revive confidence in the aviation industry in Southeast Asia, which is already rattled by a string of incidents including Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

The glitch itself would not have caused the plane to crash—""if they'd just kept on flying it.""

""Utterly Preventable""

At first it was assumed that severe weather caused the Airbus A320 to crash into the Java Sea last December, midway through a two-hour flight from Surabaya to Singapore. The pilots' role also came under scrutiny, with air traffic control and other data showing unusual movements just before the plane went into its fatal dive—it was climbing at a rate of nearly 6,000 feet a minute, well outside the performance envelope of the jet. And in a revelation that suggested a strong parallel to Air France Flight 447, the junior pilot was at the controls during the critical last minutes when the plane went into a stall. It was even suggested that the plane's speed sensors may have frozen in the storm, much like the French jet's did.

But the final analysis by the Indonesian transport safety committee released this week showed that bad weather had nothing to do with it. Instead, it was a non-critical equipment failure that set off a chain of events that ultimately doomed flight QZ8501. The details of the report released this week make it clear that the tragedy was ""utterly preventable,"" said John Goglia, former member of the National Transportation Safety Board.

It started when a component in the rudder mechanism failed. This very thing had happened at least 23 times in the year before the accident, the report said, due to a botched soldering job. As usual, a warning light and alarm alerted the crew, who treated it a bit like your check engine light that goes on and off repeatedly.

""You don't pull circuit breakers in-flight unless the manual tells you to.""

""It was an ongoing problem. He keeps getting this light, and he'd gotten it before, three days earlier, on the same plane,"" said Goglia, who has followed the investigation closely. This time, three attempts to reset using push buttons didn't succeed in removing error messages. ""And then he remembers he saw somebody pulling the circuit breaker that last time, so he decided to do it in flight."" In effect, the flight crew attempted to reboot the plane's computers. ""The flight protection envelope then goes haywire,"" Goglia said, with the plane stalling before entering its fatal dive.

Goglia said the tragedy is that the glitch itself would not have caused the plane to crash ""if they'd just kept on flying it, with the warning light on, like they had in the previous year.""

""Here we have pilots who think they can troubleshoot in flight, they're playing around with the flight controls, of all things. It's as basic rule of aviation: You don't pull circuit breakers in-flight unless the manual tells you to,"" he said. ""Intermittent problems are the most difficult ones to fix and intermittent electrical problems are even more difficult. Just because he saw a mechanic do it on the ground, doesn't mean you can do that in the air.""

More Bad News

The detailed account of what led to the disaster will do nothing to boost confidence in the region's aviation sector. It's part of a string of aviation disasters in Southeast Asia, whose rapid air travel growth has stoked safety concerns – and led to sanctions against some Indonesian airlines by the EU, among others.

But there's plenty of blame to go around. Investigators not only told Indonesia AirAsia to boost pilot training and to guard against crewmembers ""improvising"" fixes in an emergency, but also said an Airbus manual on when to reset computers was ""potentially ambiguous.""

At press time, Airbus had no comment, although AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes tweeted that ""there is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer, and the aviation industry."""
Airbus Helicopters works to enhance capabilities of H145 - Flightglobal,"Thu, 03 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXdvcmtzLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzLW9mLWgxNDUvMTE5MDY4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is hoping to capitalise on the smooth service entry of its new H145 – formerly the T2 variant of the long-running EC145 medium twin – and add extra capabilities to the baseline rotorcraft.

First delivery of the new Donauwörth, Germany-built model – which gains uprated 900shp (671kW) Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines, a shrouded anti-torque rotor and new carbonfibre tail boom – took place in July 2014 to German medical services provider DRF Luftrettung.

Since then, 43 helicopters have been handed over to 14 customers, accumulating a total 10,400 flight hours, says programme manager Dragos Grigorincu.

Availability is targeted at 85%, however Grigorincu believes it will be able to achieve over 90%.

“The overall statement coming from operators is that it has been a smooth entry into service,” he says, with unscheduled maintenance “kept to a minimum”.

Envelope expansion work has already been carried out, with test flights conducted in April and May this year in Bolivia to enable a certificated density altitude of 20,000ft from 2016.

Airbus Helicopters

Additional features will also be added to the Helionix avionics suite next year, including ADS-B Out, a synthetic vision system, digital maps, and localiser performance vertical approach guidance.

An iPad-based electronic flight bag with full connectivity is also being developed “over the next one to two years”, says Grigorincu.

A health monitoring system is also being rolled out this year, which includes engine vibration monitoring, largely driven by the requirement for the feature from operators in the offshore transportation segment, he says.

Although around 80% of deliveries so far have been to the emergency medical services sector, offshore operators are increasingly showing interest in the eight-passenger helicopter.

That has been underlined by a firm commitment signed on 2 December for 10 H145s from Mexico’s Pegaso for use in oil and gas operations. Deliveries are to start from 2017.

Backlog for the type now stands at 180 aircraft, a mixture of firm orders and options, says Grigorincu.

Production ramp-up of the new variant is increasing, from 13 last year to 40 in 2015, rising to a maximum of 60 next year.

However, the airframer continues to work through its backlog of older models, both the baseline helicopter and the stripped down EC145e – confusingly now marketed as the EC145 – with a combined 70 airframes still to build.

The vast majority of those are destined for the US Army’s UH-72 Lakota programme, with Donauwörth-built kits transferred to a facility in Columbus, Mississippi for final assembly.

Airbus Helicopters declines to be drawn on when it will phase out production of the older model, but this is unlikely to extend much beyond 2016.

The scholarships were awarded to Kate Goldup; Kathryn Pugh; Megan Reynolds and Joanna Savage by Professor Ian Lane from the Airbus Group.

Airbus is a close industrial partner of the University’s Faculty of Engineering and the scholarships forms part of an outreach and widening participation investment, with a particular emphasis on encouraging more women to take up STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects.

Professor Ian Lane, Airbus Group Senior Technical Expert said: ‘‘We have been working very closely with the University of Bristol for many years on a variety of research and teaching projects. This year we decided to do something to specifically support women in engineering – and to make sure that the excitement and fascination of studying and practicing engineering can reach and inspire as wide a group of tomorrow’s engineers as possible. I was delighted to meet these exceptional women and present the Airbus Group Scholarships.”

Megan Reynolds, a scholarship recipient added: ‘I am very excited and enthusiastic about the Airbus Group Scholarship and all it has to offer. I am particularly looking forward to the outreach project where it will not only give the young students a chance to understand the influence of engineering within society, but also to understand the importance of diversity within the engineering field, and why women are a very key element.”

The Faculty of Engineering will host the first Airbus Aerospace Day next year [March 2016]. The aim of the day will be to engage Year 8 girls from schools in the Bristol area and promote aerospace engineering as an exciting and achievable career path. The day will include inspirational interactions with world-leading academics and industry experts together with many hands-on activities.

Professor Andrew Nix, Dean of Engineering at the University of Bristol, said: “Our partnership with Airbus goes from strength to strength. The initiatives this year to focus on women in engineering fully align with our aspirations to address the gender imbalance in this area and I look forward to the exciting outreach activities in the year ahead.”

This year the University of Bristol signed a University Partnership Agreement with the Airbus Group at the Paris Air Show to formalise and build on the commitments from both parties for training, education and diversity."
ANA Places Order For 3 Airbus A380s! - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FuYS1hMzgwLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While I love the A380 from a passenger comfort standpoint, the plane hasn’t been performing well for Airbus, and is at risk of being a huge money loser for them. Airbus has been pondering discontinuing A380 production, given the lack of new orders for the plane.

A380 works great for Emirates, but other than that airlines don’t really seem delighted by the plane. At least they’re not placing any extra orders, which is what counts.

Why isn’t there more demand for the A380, despite demand for travel constantly being on the rise? It comes down to there being smaller planes out there which are also more efficient, like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. These planes have low operating costs and much lower capacity, allowing airlines to offer more frequencies and also better manage yields.



Qatar Airways A350

The sad thing about A380 production potentially ending is that the plane definitely could have a bright future, but it may just be 10-20 years ahead of its time. International travel will get to the point where there will be consistent demand for 500+ seat planes as airport congestion continues to get worse, but it’s just not quite there yet.

Speaking of the lack of A380 orders, there’s finally some slightly good news for Airbus. Japanese Airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) has just placed an order for three A380s, which they should take delivery of in 2018. Via Nikkei:

ANA Holdings will order three Airbus A380s as it seeks to expand international service amid a peaking market for domestic flights. The deal, worth around 150 billion yen ($1.23 billion) based on the market price, would make ANA the first Japanese airline to add the superjumbos to its fleet. The planes are to be introduced in fiscal 2018 in routes to Hawaii and elsewhere.

Ordering A380s for the purpose of flying them to Hawaii? That’s a first among A380 operators. While Honolulu is a huge vacation market for Japanese tourists, it sure sounds like they’re going for a high density configuration.



Could Honolulu Airport see the whale jet in a few years?

Perhaps even denser than Emirates’ new two cabin A380s, which seat 615 people. If they are truly just going for a high density configuration, I’m surprised they wouldn’t instead reconfigure a 777-300ER into a high density configuration. After all, there are some 777s out there with 400+ seats.



Emirates now operates some two cabin A380s with 615 seats

Clearly there’s more to this deal. Back in August I wrote about the speculation of ANA ordering some A380s. That’s because Skymark (which had ordered some A380s) went bankrupt earlier in the year, and ANA was competing to buy them, primarily because they wanted their slots at Tokyo Haneda.



Former Skymark A380

Airbus was one of their creditors, so something tells me this might have been part of the overall deal which gave ANA the edge in wining the Skymark bid.

Bottom line

Having flown the A380s of every airline which operates the plane, I’m excited to eventually have a new airline to try. However, it sure sounds like this will be a high density configuration aircraft. For that matter the order is a bit weird — they’re buying just three of them and plan to operate them to a leisure destination, which sort of defies what most other A380 operators have done up until now.

So I’m guessing this is part of a larger deal they had with Airbus in regards to Skymark, which would make a lot more sense.

What do you make of ANA buying three A380s and using them for Hawaii flights?"

NHV, a fast growing international helicopter operator, is pursuing its development by rolling out its strategic plan to become a sizeable, alternative player. After five years, the company has established its new base in Aberdeen. NHV is proud to announce that two Airbus H175 helicopters will reinforce the Aberdeen base’s fleet.

Being present in Aberdeen is very important for NHV to enable the company to serve its existing and future customers in one of the most strategic helicopter hubs of the industry. The heliport facility is located at the northeast corner of Aberdeen Dyce airport with short distances to the runways and a limited taxiing time needed.

In 2014, NHV was the world launching customer of the H175 helicopters in the Netherlands. Following this success and considering the capabilities of the aircraft, NHV will now position the H175 in the UK market. In 2015, the addition of one AW 139, four H175s (of which three delivered this week) and four to come in 2016, will equip NHV with a very young and adapted fleet to position the company well despite difficult market conditions due to the drop of the oil price.

“The opening of our Aberdeen base and the first Aberdeen based contract with Chevron North Sea Limited will start on the first of January with two H175s. These are strategically very important achievements which were only possible thanks to the commitment from all our stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our partners and our majority shareholder, Ardian,” says Eric Van Hal, CEO NHV Group.

The NHV Aberdeen heliport complex comprises a 2,400-square-meter hangar and offices, a passenger terminal with check in, X-ray, security, safety equipment storage and issue, and safety briefing rooms. On the ground floor of the complex there is a general waiting area, and on the upper floor, a dedicated passenger lounge. Catering facilities are provided by a local supplier."

The win marks the first time that honor has gone to an aircraft not made by Boeing.

The A380 is world’s biggest commercial airliner, offering 544 passenger seats in a typical four-class configuration on two levels. Emirates recently shattered that record by debuting a 615-seater A380 that scraps the roomy first class in favor of a space-saving business section and expanded economy seats.

Currently, no U.S.-owned airlines operate A380s, according to Airbus, though the A320 family is used by many of the country’s top carriers including Frontier Airlines, jetBlue, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American and Virgin America. Since the A380 was first introduced to the market in 2007, there have been 176 planes delivered to 12 airlines around the world.

Last year, Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner took home the top prize for best aircraft.

In addition to best aircraft, Global Traveler readers voted in nearly 50 travel related categories including best airline website (JetBlue.com); best domestic airline for first class (Virgin America); best over-all frequent-flyer program (United Mileage Plus); best airport in North America (Chicago O’Hare) and best overall global airline (Singapore Airlines).

'Heart' of NASA's Orion Spacecraft to Undergo Stress Tests - Space.com,"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS8zMTI0Mi1vcmlvbi1zcGFjZWNyYWZ0LXNlcnZpY2UtbW9kdWxlLXN0cmVzcy10ZXN0cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The structural test article of the European service module for Orion is being assembled at Airbus Defence and Space. Airbus is building the module, which will supply the spacecraft’s power, in-space propulsion and air and water for the crew, on behalf of ESA (European Space Agency) for Orion. The STA is being transported to Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook station for testing.

A critical piece of NASA's Orion spacecraft — which may carry astronauts to deep-space locations like Mars — is about to begin a series of crucial tests to determine whether or not it can withstand the rigors of spaceflight.

The Orion service module, built by the European Space Agency, provides propulsion for the Orion vehicle and critical life support to the crew, among other things. On Nov. 7, a test version of the module was delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center’s Space Power Facility (SPF) at the Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio. The facility will test how the system will withstand the intense shaking and thrust associated with a launch, as well as the heat and pressure extremes it will encounter in space, among other things.

""It's the only place you can test a vehicle of this size, fully deployed, in its launch and space configuration[s], which is so important in ensuring mission success,"" Jim Free, director of NASA’s Glenn Research Center, said in a press briefing yesterday (Nov. 30). ""It's really that 'one stop shop' for environmental tests on this scale."" [Orion Explained: NASA's Multipurpose Crew Vehicle]

NASA's Orion space vehicle will launch atop the agency's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and has the capability to take human astronauts on journeys to the moon or possibly Mars. Orion underwent its first test flight on Dec. 5, 2014, but during that test, the craft was not fully equipped for a trip into deep space. Sometime in 2018, NASA plans to launch Orion on a fully integrated test flight known as Exploration Mission-1. That flight will take the uncrewed vehicle around the moon.

Among the tests that the service module will undergo at Glenn Space Center will be an acoustic stress test and a mechanical vibration test to simulate the launch environment, as well as shocks tests to mimic the vehicle's separation from the rocket. The facility hosts a vacuum chamber that is 100 feet in diameter and 120 feet tall that will mimic the vacuum environment in space. The facility will also fire pyrotechnics to test the temperature resilience of the vehicle's solar arrays.

""That testing is going to identify any risks that we haven't gone through, any design problems, any potential failures, right here in a controlled environment on the ground,"" Free said. ""And that’s the best place to find those issues — before we're in flight.""

The service module serves many purposes for Orion, according to Mark Kirasich, manager for the Orion Program. It acts as the propulsion system, provides steering and avionics for the spacecraft, and during the ascent from Earth, it ""gives the spacecraft an abort capability, should we have a contingency,"" Kirasich said. In addition, it has solar arrays that are used to collect energy and power all the equipment onboard Orion, including radiators that keep the temperature ideal for both the equipment and the passengers; it also carries oxygen, nitrogen and water for crew life support.

""As you can easily understand, the ESA service module is a critical element of Orion,"" Kirasich said. ""We aren't going anywhere without it.""

Kirasich said that after the series of tests is completed at Glenn Space Center, the service module will be disassembled. Some of the remaining parts will be refurbished and undergo further testing, with some sent to Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, while other parts will return to Europe, where additional iterations of the service module are being constructed.

Two representatives from the European Space Agency spoke at the press briefing yesterday: Nico Dettmann, development department head at ESA, and Oliver Juckenhoefel, vice president and head of the European Service Module program at Airbus Defence and Space (ESA's corporate contractor for the module). Juckenhoefel spoke extensively about the need for collaboration in order to make an optimum vehicle, adding, ""NASA cannot fly without us, and we cannot fly without them.""

When it was announced that ESA would build Orion's service module, the agency said the module would likely cost several hundred million dollars, but would be delivered as an in-kind contribution. No agency has stated definitively if ESA's contribution of the Orion service module will guarantee that ESA astronauts will fly on Orion missions.

""It's obviously the ultimate objective to have an ESA astronaut flying beyond low-earth orbit, and we hope that this cooperation will actually lead to having a European astronaut on such a mission,"" Dettmann said.

Greg Williams, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations added, ""This is going to be an international endeavor on this long journey to Mars, and we would love to see astronauts from several nations be involved when we first set foot on the Red Planet.""

Dutch State Secretary of Infrastructure and the Environment Dijksma announced that to parliament two days ago.

Emirates began in 2010 with daily flights to Schiphol Airport with a Boeing 777. Two years later, the company was the first airline to come to the airport with an Airbus A380.

In 2013 there was a second daily flight, but with the smaller Boeing 777. Now Emirates could be allowed to fly a second A380 between Dubai and Amsterdam.

The arrival of this second A380 is not obvious. Many companies and critics believe that Emirates receives unfair state aid in Dubai. The Lower House also wanted to know from the State Secretary whether this authorisation could be harmful for KLM.

But according to Dijksma the move represents only a limited capacity increase and there are “no significant effects on the network quality of Schiphol“. Dijksma therefore fears no ill effects, for example, for KLM and says he will keep an eye on further developments.

Emirates now has over seventy A380s and that number will increase in the coming years to 150. There are 517 seats and for the passengers of business and first class, there is a bar at their disposal ; in the front of the aircraft there are two showers, which only the fourteen first-class passengers may use.

Emirates also has an A380 for 615 passengers, with no first class and no shower. Whether this aircraft will also fly to Amsterdam is not known."

Qatar Airways is ramping up its expansion into the United States regardless of whatever concerns American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines may have.

This week, Qatar Airways announced plans to commence service between its home base in Doha, Qatar, and the US using its new fleet of Airbus A350 jets.

A350 service in the US kicks off January 1 on the airline's Doha-to-Philadelphia route.

""We are proud to be the first commercial airline to land the Airbus A350 in the United States,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said in a statement.

""As the global launch customer of this new-generation aircraft, we are excited to introduce it to the American market.""

Qatar Airways currently flies to 152 destinations around the world, including New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Washington, D.C.

The airline plans to open routes from Doha to Los Angeles in January, Boston in March, and Atlanta in June.

The Persian Gulf-based airline has grown rapidly over the past decade and now boasts a fleet of 168 aircraft. In addition, Qatar has another 330 jets on order, which are valued at more than $70 billion.

In June, Qatar Airways was named Airline of the Year for 2015 by the leading aviation consumer organization Skytrax. It's a prize the airline also took home in 2011 and 2012.

Qatar's success has not come without pitfalls. American, United, and Delta Air Lines have accused Qatar along with Etihad Airways and Emirates of fueling its palatial terminals, luxury service, and massive fleets with $42 billion in government subsidies.

Airbus A350 XWB Qatar Airways_cabin_crew

Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad deny these accusations. The coalition of US airlines has petitioned the US State Department to reevaluate the ""Open Skies"" agreements between the US and the Gulf states that allow airlines to fly freely between the countries.

Al Baker told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that whatever money his airline had received from the Qatari government had been in the form of investment in exchange for equity.

Story continues

Etihad CEO James Hogan echoed Al Baker's sentiments, telling Business Insider: ""At the end of the day. We have a shareholder who placed equity in the airline who gave us loans to be repaid. That's what people do when they invest in the business.""

""We've done nothing improper,"" Hogan continued. ""We've created a great airline, with great service, created value, and the accounts are audited by one of the top accounting firms in the world.""

Qatar is the launch partner for the Airbus A350-900 twin-engine long-range airliner. The airline expects to have eight of the jets in its fleet by the end of the year, with 72 more on order. The A350 fleet is currently deployed only on routes to Germany and Singapore.

The A350 is powered by two powerful and efficient Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan engines. The jet can carry as many as 325 passengers in three different classes, with a fuel range of about 8,700 miles.

AirAsia Airbus Crash Report Released - SOFREP,"Thu, 03 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc29mcmVwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmFzaWEtYWlyYnVzLWNyYXNoLXJlcG9ydC1yZWxlYXNlZC_SAUFodHRwczovL3NvZnJlcC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvYWlyYXNpYS1haXJidXMtY3Jhc2gtcmVwb3J0LXJlbGVhc2VkLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fast forward to December 28 th , and the same captain was flying the same aircraft out of Surabaya with the first officer acting as pilot flying. Once enroute, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) showed the master caution activating four times with the rudder travel limiter failure. After the first three master cautions, the crew complied with the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) procedure. Yet on the fourth, the FDR recorded a different response, this time akin to the action several days prior of resetting the FAC circuit breakers. This action produced a less than desirable (but not yet dangerous) result when the master caution activated again as a result of the FAC 1 & 2 faults. Consequently, the autopilot and auto-throttle systems failed and the aircraft’s flight control logic switched from Normal Law to Alternate Law.

Three days prior to the crash of QZ8501, the Airbus A320 registered PK-AXC was operating a flight from Surabaya to Kuala Lumpur. The same captain (with over 20,000 total hours, over 4600 in type) made a call to maintenance with a failure of the rudder travel limit system. After resetting the flight augmentation computer (FAC) circuit breakers, the problem went away, only to resurface shortly. Upon replacing the #2 FAC, the aircraft departed for Kuala Lumpur without incident.

Airliner crash investigations are painstakingly exhaustive, and rarely the result of any single incident (the recent Metrojet Airbus crash in Egypt could be one of those rare instances) but more often the chain of cascading events that lead to an unrecoverable situation. Indonesia’s NTSC identified several contributing factors in their final report, so let’s take a look at what happened .

The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) of Indonesia has released their final report on the December 2014 crash of Indonesia AirAsia flight QZ8501, which plunged into the Java Sea while enroute from Surabaya to Singapore-Changi International. As with any accident, this crash occurred after a series of cascading events took place, ultimately resulting in the deaths of all 162 passengers and crew onboard.

The newly re-energized FACs created a sudden rudder deflection of 2° left. That might not sound like much, but for a jet traveling along at cruise speed it is sufficient to cause an upset. The A320 began an uncommanded bank, rolling left at a rate of 6° per second, reaching 54° before any pilot input was recorded. The first officer’s control input however, was full up and right, and the aircraft almost returned to wings level but quickly rolled left again, this time to 53° of bank. Since the FO continued to hold backpressure on the stick, the aircraft began climbing at a rapid rate, up to 11,000 feet per minute.

With that rate of climb the airspeed rapidly decreased and soon the stall warning activated, and soon after the captain also began making control inputs and continued doing so until impact with the ocean. The FO also stayed on the controls, applying mostly maximum back pressure for the now short remainder of the flight.

So here’s the situation. An aircraft’s nice and stable cruise flight is upset, and the response from the FO is to pull fully back on the stick. The airplane begins to stall, and the stall warning should have been a trigger for the crew to promptly apply the stall recovery procedure. The captain adds opposite control inputs and says “pull down” (an entirely misleading and ambiguous command). So both pilots have their hands on the sidestick, but give differing inputs. Who’s really in control?

The normal sidestick logic averages each of the inputs, so with the FO pulling all the way back on the sidestick and the captain pushing forward slightly, the average command was still nose up – not the stall recovery procedure. Airbus incorporated a cutout, so that whoever presses the sidestick takeover pushbutton allows for positive control to be maintained, but doesn’t deactivate the other pilot’s sidestick at the outset. Pushing the takeover button for at least 40 seconds deactivates the opposing sidestick and had the captain exercised that option, it could have resulted in AirAsia 8501 recovering from the stall.

It’s entirely possible that both pilots were simply unaware of what the other was doing and what control inputs were being made. In contrast to the traditional center-pedestal yoke controls on most other airliners, the Airbus utilizes a side-stick design with the stick outboard of each pilot. This means that instead of being able to directly see and observe the other pilot’s control inputs right in front of you on a yoke, the much smaller control stick on your side remains stationary regardless of the other pilot’s inputs. Usually this isn’t a problem, but when you find yourself in a deep stall and literally dropping from the sky, clear and appropriate communication between pilots is absolutely imperative.

The aircraft stalled and descended towards the ocean at up to 20,000 feet per minute, maintaining an angle of attack (AOA) of about 40 degrees which is well above the A320’s critical angle of attack.

The AirAsia Airbus Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM) states that: “The effectiveness of fly-by-wire architecture and the existence of control laws eliminate the need for upset recovery maneuvers to be trained on protected Airbus aircraft.” Clearly this is has proven to be an absurd statement, with several in-flight upsets resulting in fatal crashes even in recent years. Sound familiar at all?

The QZ8501 investigation report continues, “FBW (Fly by Wire) and conventional aircraft on FBW aircraft, following certain malfunctions, in particular in case of sensor or computer failure, the flight controls cannot ensure the protections against the stall.” This is very similar to Air France 447, an Airbus A330 that crashed off the coast of Brazil in June 2009. When the autopilot was disconnected after disagreements in airspeed indications, the pilot flying (PF) fought the airplane all the way to the water by applying maximum back pressure on the stick, having never fully realized the A330 was stalling.

Part of the design philosophy of Airbus, and the associated training, is to recover the aircraft from a stall when the warning is activated – an “approach to stall” – while not actually stalling the aircraft. This same philosophy was present in US airlines as well, prior to the crash of Colgan 3407 in February 2009. The problem with this philosophy is that it doesn’t involve recovering an aircraft from an upset situation – it simply attempts to avoid the situation altogether. While admirable and effective for the most part, this means that some situations can take a crew by surprise, like QZ8501 and AF447. Flight crews, having never been in a similar situation, can easily become overwhelmed and initiate the wrong response.

An additional contributing factor was the rudder travel limiter system failure that had surfaced 23 times in the previous year, with the number of events spiking sharply in the weeks prior to the crash. It was eventually linked to cracking in the soldering on the electronic module of the Rudder Travel Limiter Unit.

Though troubling in and of itself, this annoying AUTO FLT RUD TVL LIM SYS failure message should not have caused a modern Airbus to plunge into the ocean. It took a non-standard procedure (pulling circuit breakers to reset the system in-flight) resulting in further system failures, followed by a crew that was not well-versed in recovering an aircraft from the subsequent upset or unusual attitude situations and did not maintain positive control over the aircraft.

While stalls and other unusual attitudes can be somewhat replicated in high-fidelity full-motion simulators, hands-on experience in an aircraft as part of an upset recovery program provides numerous benefits for aircrews that might find themselves in a seemingly perilous situation. Unfortunately these programs are not cheap, and airlines aren’t exactly scrambling to use their millions in baggage fees to send their pilots through specialized upset training. Though it won’t bring back the lives lost in AF447 or QZ8501, programs like this might help save lives in the future, and that alone is worth the investment.

3-D printing in aviation - DW (English),"Wed, 02 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9mdXR1cmUtcHJpemUtM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctZW5hYmxlcy1hdmlhdGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyeS10by1mbG91cmlzaC9hLTE4ODg2OTU10gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2Z1dHVyZS1wcml6ZS0zZC1wcmludGluZy1lbmFibGVzLWF2aWF0aW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5LXRvLWZsb3VyaXNoL2EtMTg4ODY5NTU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In early 2016 Airbus will begin producing airplane components with its own Selective Laser Melting machines. These advances are the first step in building the factory of the future.

3-D printing, the process of printing a tangible structural element, is common within a variety of fields: you can find it in dental replacements, artificial hip-joints but also for manufacturing tools.

Until now, parts manufactured using 3-D technology have been unable to compete with traditionally made components. But that is rapidly changing - especially within the realms of the aviation industry where weight is a major consideration when it comes to manufacturing.

Concept Laser, a German company, is at the forefront of high-quality 3-D printing. The fledgling company was responsible for building the first such printer capable of producing real components with a method called Selective Laser Melting (SLM).

SLM builds up components by putting thin layers of melted metal on top of each other Image: DW/F. Schmidt

Melting, rather than sintering

With that, it was made possible to use common industrial alloys, like steel or titanium in 3-D printing. Before the advent of the SLM, there were 3-D printers on the market, but they only had the capabilites to sinter rare and uncommon alloys in a process similar to that used during the production of ceramics. But the end product was not very durable.

In order to properly melt the metal, inventor and company founder, Frank Herzog, had to overcome several hurdles. He needed to develop a means of circumventing the problem of tension build-up within the metal during the melting process which ultimately led to components cracking.

""I watched a toolmaker welding,"" he recalls, ""he did not do one continuous weld, but several shorter ones. This was to prevent his work from coming apart."" It was then he had the idea to change things up a little bit - ""my own idea was to change the exposure of the metal powder to the laser light so that the energy would be more evenly distributed.""

Rather than melting the powder in one continuous line, Herzog decided the laser would work randomly. With that he determined numerous tiny sections, each of which was exposed to laser light only very briefly. But that required huge amounts of data - and back then, computers were not that powerful.

The most difficult task was to ensure the layers of the metal did not separate Image: DZP/Ansgar Pudenz

Too much data

""It took me two to three weeks and numerous system crashes to get the data loaded into the machine. The component we wanted to print was huge - normally this would never have worked. After two days of printing, I opened it up and it was completely free of cracks. That was a Eureka moment, and I registered my first patent,"" Herzog explains of his innaugral invention.

The inventors' next hurdle was to improve the homogeneity of the material, since the printed parts were often still quite porous. Herzog wondered if it was due to the wavelength of the CO2 laser machines, which were common in those days. Fortunately for Herzog, his girlfriend (who later became his wife) had purchased a more modern solid-state laser with a shorter wavelength for her family business.

""We thought shorter wavelengths would penetrate the material much better,"" Herzog recalls. ""Then we ran some test exposures and found out that the laser was able to completely melt the alloy.""

The real deal

Herzog's discovery revolutionized 3-D printing. From now on, it was not only about producing prototypes but really durable components and tools. In 2001, at the Euromold Trade Fair in Frankfurt, Herzog presented his company and his first printer.

In the 14 years that have followed, he has been flooded with requests from the industry. Today, Concept Laser covers about one-fourth of the world market in SLM 3-D printers, and is constantly developing better and more powerful machines.

Bionics improves products

Meanwhile, in Hamburg, Professor Claus Emmelmann has made SLM a main focus of his work at the Technical University. Emmelmann also founded the Laserzentrum Nord (LZN) - a company that functions as a bridge between university education, applied research and business.

The pipe's diameter and thickness changes according to real pressures Image: DW/F. Schmidt

Heading into the large factory hall, the professor comments on the center's design principles - which includes product components for aviation, medicine, tools and engineering.

Holding up an example of their work, Emmelmann points to a complex, but quite elegant looking bundle of pipes.

""It weighs just 20-percent of a conventional manifold. We do not have to drill holes into it, therefore the pipes can be formed to accommodate the actual hydraulic pressure."" This, the professor adds, enables them to reduce pressure loss by 50-percent. ""This component is not just lighter, but also more efficent.""

Less susceptible to interference

3-D printing gives engineers options they did not dare dream of before. The added bonus, the technology is ideal for aviation. Professor Emmelmann found the ideal partner in Peter Sander, an engineer at Airbus' R & D department.

Laserzentrum Nord is already producing lightweight airplane components for Airbus Image: DW/F. Schmidt

Open call for ideas

Sander didn't hesitate. ""One year ago, we started a campaign and told everybody: 'We will be able to print in about one year. We are looking for solutions that reduce complexity, weight or shorten the production time - anything we can achieve by 3-D printing."" That was Sanders' open call for ideas at Airbus to find out what was possible. ""Within five weeks we had 192 proposals on the table,"" he recalls.

Of those, Sander selected 13 finalists. ""Those teams showed to the top management what they'd discovered. And everyone was blown away - there were components nobody had even imagined were possible.""

In 2016, Airbus will launch its SLM series production through its 100-percent subsidiary, called Premium Aerotech. For Frank Herzog, this means a new era in the rapid development of his company - Airbus will soon need more, faster, bigger and more powerful machines. And the young company founder is determined to deliver, ""we have grown as a company only because the industry continuously presented us with new demands - and we always took up the new challenges.""

The next challenge - stemming from the series production of Airbus - is called: Automation. So far all printed components need to be taken out of the machines, cleaned, and the quality controlled by hand. In the future this will be done by robots - welcome to the future factory.

The three laser printing pioneers - Herzog, Emmelmann and Sander have been nominated for the German Future Awards, which German President Joachim Gauck will award in a ceremony on December 2 in Berlin."
"Delivery of Airbus A320neo aircraft to be delayed, says IndiGo - Business Standard","Sat, 19 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tYWlyY3JhZnQtdG8tYmUtZGVsYXllZC1zYXlzLWluZGlnby0xMTUxMjE5MDA0MjBfMS5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tYWlyY3JhZnQtdG8tYmUtZGVsYXllZC1zYXlzLWluZGlnby0xMTUxMjE5MDA0MjBfMS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IndiGo, India's largest airline by market share, has said deliveries of Airbus A320neo aircraft will be delayed. It has ordered 430 such planes and was expecting the first to be delivered on December 30.



In a stock exchange notification, IndiGo said it received an update from Airbus that delivery of the first aircraft will be delayed due to “industrial reasons”.



“At this time, IndiGo does not have a clear visibility of its future A320neo delivery schedule and the potential for additional delays exist. We are looking at mitigating the potential shortfall in capacity through other options,” the airline said in its exchange notification.



IndiGo has 98 Airbus A320 aircraft at present and plans to add 23 planes in the next financial year. The airline may be forced to dry lease aircraft on a short term basis. Last year, IndiGo took 12 A320s on lease from Indonesia's Tigerair Mandala to ramp up capacity.



IndiGo did not specify the “industrial reasons”. Earlier this month, a report in aviation magazine Air Transport World said an unresolved issue connected with the aircraft's geared turbofan engine was the reason for the delay and the last-minute swap in launch customer for the aircraft. The engine is made by Pratt & Whitney and promises 15 percent lesser fuel burn.



Qatar Airways was supposed to be the launch customer for A320neo and according to the report the airline has refused to take deliveries until operational restrictions placed on the engine are lifted. IndiGo was to take delivery after Qatar Airways.



Now, Lufthansa will be the launch customer for Airbus A320neo followed by Qatar Airways and IndiGo, the report added. IndiGo has declined to comment on the report."

Data: Airlineroute

It seems the reach of Emirates Airbus A380 continues to expand wherever the airline touches it its fleet. For one airport who extended their runway for long distance and super heavy aircraft – there must some relief that Emirates will operate an A380 to that airport now.

For the other airports – it’s more capacity to feed into the fortress hub of Dubai, and send passengers onto other destinations.

There is nothing an airline won't try to fit more people on a plane, judging by some of these designs.

Airbus, one of the biggest plane companies, files hundreds of patents every year covering everything from the direction seats face to what the window looks like.

Most of these will never go into production. But all of them offer a glimpse at what is going on at the sharp edge of plane technology - and of what the future could look like in air travel.

Here are some of the best - and the worst - we saw in 2015.

Five of the best

1. SkyDeck

The SkyDeck system visualisation by Windspeed Technologies ( Windspeed Technologies, YouTube )

Windspeed Technologies, a “premier aerospace engineering services company”, released details of a system called SkyDeck that allows passengers to observe the view in-flight from on top of the plane.

SkyDeck could mean big bucks for airlines if they charge on a pay-per-view basis, putting a huge premium on the experience.

2. The 'removable cabin pod'

Airbus has patented a design that allows a plane's cabin to be detatched and suspended at the gate via a series of crane-like arms. The design allows passengers to climb aboard the plane from the boarding gate - and could help disabled passengers as they would no longer have to scale any steps.

3. Emirates fits in an extra 98 seats

( Emirates )

Emirates has found a way to fit 98 extra seats into its new Airbus A380-800 planes: by doing away with first class. It still looks pretty roomy though.

4. Interactive windows

The windows on the Airbus patent are described as a ""method for interactive visualization of information in an aircraft cabin"". ( US Patent Office )

Airbus has patented windows that work like a giant iPad. The patent is for a ""semi-transparent screen"" with eye tracking software and technology that can acquire a ""representation such as an image of an environment outside the aircraft cabin window"".

5. Faster than Concorde

The new Airbus 'Concorde 2' ( YogiPatent )

This patent is for an Airbus design for a successor to Concorde will fly at 4.5 times the speed of sound and get passengers from London to New York in one hour flat.

Five of the worst

1. The windowless plane

( Zodiac Aerospace )

Zodiac Aerospace has released plans which will see the lower deck of the proposed jumbo jet being converted into passenger seating. Storage has been moved to the side of the plane in smaller “cubbies”.

2. Stacked seating

Airbus patented a mezzanine seating design that piles passengers on top of one another. In this design, passengers are able to recline into a lying position, but the seats are also stacked on top of one another, so that another set of passengers can fit just a few feet above the first.

3. Hexagonal seating

The submitted plans show passengers facing each other ( Zodiac )

Zodiac has engineered a hexagonal seating arrangement whereby the middle seat of each row faces backwards and allows more paying customers to be packed like sardines into the space.

4. Sleeping box

An Airbus patent for a sleeping box for installation in an aircraft ( US Patent Office )

Airbus have patented a sleeping box for passengers with feet facing towards the centre of the plane. They would still be required to buckle up during take off and landing - and they would still be served meals.

5. Even more seats

At the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2015, Airbus unveiled a version of its A380 jumbo jet with 11 seats per row - one more than is installed currently. But the plane isn't getting any bigger, so that means the seats may get smaller: just 18 inches across. The design could be available from 2017."
Virgin America goes for the A321neo - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi8xNi92aXJnaW4tYW1lcmljYS1nb2VzLWZvci10aGUtYTMyMW5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin America are to get larger planes in its fleet, with the airline planning to introduce Airbus A321neo aircraft from 2017



Virgin America Airbus A321neo – Image, Virgin America/Airbus

The first of the ten-strong fleet will join Virgin America from March 2017, with deliveries through to 2018. The airline currently operate Airbus A319s and A320s family aircraft in its fleet already, so an A321 is a natural fit for the airline.

Virgin America will operate their A321neos with 185 total seats – the exact breakdown hasn’t been revealed yet. The airline currently operate their Airbus A320s either in a 146 seat configuration or a 149 seat layout.

The uses of an A321 are great – be it from a slot constrained airport, or moving a lot of passengers at a lower cost – and cost is everything no matter what any airline PR says.

Combined with the fuel savings the A321neo will offer compared to the existing A320ceo family aircraft, these should be a boon to the Virgin America fleet.

Iberia A330 emerges with wifi; part of IAG's broader #PaxEx plan - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTIvaWJlcmlhLWEzMzAtZW1lcmdlcy13aXRoLXdpZmktcGFydC1vZi1pYWdzLWJyb2FkZXItcGF4ZXgtcGxhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IAG, the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, recently divulged details about its plans for the passenger experience (#PaxEx), including, notably, inflight connectivity equipage of its shorthaul and longhaul fleets.

At present, British Airways operates two, all-business Airbus A318s between London City and New York JFK; these are fitted with OnAir’s Inmarsat Swiftbroadband-powered connectivity solution. Additionally, Iberia’s Airbus A330-300 and refitted A340-600 fleets carry the same OnAir system, which is expensive for passengers and relatively slow. A British Airways Boeing 747, G-CIVG, has served as a flying testbed for Panasonic Avionics’ Ku-band satellite system, and is receiving Panasonic’s eX3 IFE system (17 other 747s in the BA fleet are earmarked for eX3 as well). At least one Vueling Airbus A320 has been fitted with the Thales/LiveTV Ka-band connectivity system.

In total, IAG has been studying inflight connectivity on 35 aircraft within its portfolio. Leveraging its knowledge of the different systems, IAG says up to 60 new longhaul aircraft will be delivered with satellite connectivity, including all new A350s destined for IAG carriers, as well as 787-10s for British Airways and certain A330s.

Today the first of these longhaul aircraft broke cover – a new Iberia Airbus A330-200 with an inflight connectivity antenna hump.

Routehappy data research manager – and RGN contributor – Jason Rabinowitz immediately called it.

Waitttt a second. That bird has a Ku hump on it. Iberia has only had awful l-band previously. #PaxEx cc @RunwayGirl https://t.co/jgCPUBp54G — Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) December 17, 2015

Panasonic Avionics’ Ku-band system is currently the only broadband system linefit offerable on the A330, and a competing system – Inmarsat Global Xpress with Honeywell antenna – is not yet certified. The Iberia A330 is flying with Panasonic’s kit.

Lake Forest, California-based Panasonic appears to be in line to equip other IAG longhaul aircraft. In referencing the A350, specifically during its capital markets day, IAG management presented a slide with an image of Thales AVANT entertainment, which implied that Thales connectivity powered by Inmarsat Global Xpress (either with Thales or OnAir as service provider) would be installed due to the currently coupled nature of IFE + connectivity on the A350. But we later learned that the image may have been misplaced and that Panasonic is in the running for these birds.

IAG is also evaluating a wifi retrofit for over 100 long-haul aircraft with connectivity. It’s not yet clear who the provider will be.

Significantly, however, IAG highlighted its interest in installing Inmarsat’s hybrid ATG/S-band system on 300 shorthaul aircraft, citing “faster ATG network speeds and less weight & draft” as a driver. The first equipped shorthaul aircraft is expected to be flying in 2017.

We’ve known for some time that British Airways favored the ATG network and that Aer Lingus’ plans for offering Thales/LiveTV Ka-band connectivity had been shelved, but it would seem that the Vueling Ka contract may also be also in question, with IAG saying, “Group’s connectivity strategy and equipment selections are being harmonised across all OpCos.”

With the European fleet embracing ATG, one wonders how long it will take for the US Federal Communications Commission to rule on the 14G auction for this side of the pond. During the recent APEX Technology Committee conference in Newport Beach, California, Qualcomm provided a timeline, says conference participant Peter Lemme.

“The timeline was: FAA announce by end of 2015, auction end of 2017, ground network 2019. Qualcomm hedged on services, but was committed to sell hardware to all service providers. Qualcomm claim to minimize OneWeb interference by aiming low, while OneWeb terminals aim high (in the sky). If 200 Gbps for the 500 MHz, then one slice is 50-100 Gbps. Not really that big a number anymore. As a domestic service, most suited to smaller aircraft, with two antennas the size of a carton of eggs. Spectral efficiency 1+ bps/Hz.”

Meanwhile, Iberia – which is already in the midst of a rebranding – will be gaining a premium economy class on its A340-600 and A330-300 aircraft. In both instances, the airline is removing business class seats to make way for the new class of service. Its A340-600s will see a 22% reduction in business class seats, with 10 being removed to make way for 21 premium economy seats in a 2-3-2 configuration. The A330-300s will get a 21-seat premium economy cabin, with the business class reduced from 36 seats to 29.

IAG has already standardized avionics, and emergency equipment across the A330 fleets at its airlines. Economy class has also been harmonized with Recaro seats and embedded IFE. Recaro also supplies British Airways with its new World Traveler Plus seats, found on its A380, 787, 777-300ER as well as revamped 777-200ERs. While there hasn’t been an announcement regarding the supplier of the seat for Iberia’s new premium economy offering, Recaro’s PL3510 model looks to be the favorite.

Iberia also released the configuration of its A330-200 aircraft – the first having now broken cover – which will notably not receive premium economy. These aircraft, which trade cabin size for range as compared with their -300 siblings, are getting 19 Sogerma Solstys full flat beds with direct aisle access and 269 economy seats from Recaro. Iberia intends to use these aircraft to develop new markets from Madrid as well as replace its remaining A340-300s. While the A330-300 is more efficient than the A340-300s it replaced in many markets, it has a shorter range, and cannot reach many of the South American cities that Iberia serves. The A330-200s will give Iberia a choice between their aging A340-300s and A340-600s which are far too large for many markets.

British Airways previously announced its new Super Hi-J 747-400 configuration, but surprised many by announcing it planned to remove First Class from its Heathrow-based 777-200ERs. Consensus amongst many BA watchers is that this reconfiguration will be limited to its Roll-Royce Trent 892 powered aircraft, of which there are nine. These aircraft have historically served the longer routes in the BA network, as their GE-powered hangar-mates lack the capability due to their de-rated engines. Additionally, this particular subfleet of aircraft lack overhead crew rest, which is essential for the 6,000 mile flights these planes often take.

British Airways will use 787-9s to replace the 777-200ERs on many of these routes that require First Class service. BA has indicated it will deploy these aircraft to Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai, all of which frequently saw the G-YMM series aircraft that are set to lose their First Class cabins. The 787-9s will also be used on BA’s new service to San Jose, California and to open up new opportunities for South American flying. BA will have five 787-9s by the end of 2015, with a further 11 scheduled for delivery in 2016. While BA will be taking delivery of more than 50 787s and Airbus A350s, the 777 fleet is set to stay around for a while.

BA also announced it is extending the expected life of the 777 fleet to 30 years. This is interesting news as BA disposed of two A-market 777-200s after only six years of use, so the decision to extend the proposed life indicates that the airline had problems with those two specific airframes, and not dissatisfaction with the airplane overall.

The reconfiguration will leave BA’s 777-200 fleet evenly divided between 3-class and 4-class configurations, and provide aircraft for the planned growth in leisure flying from Gatwick where BA will commence service to Lima, Peru, and San Jose, Costa Rica as well as restarting service to JFK in 2016."

But now he’ll flying at a rather higher altitude - this time on the side of an Emirates Airbus A380.

The Dubai carrier, which sponsors Real as well as a number of other top European clubs, has unveiled a new decal on the world’s largest passenger plane.

The A380 has been emblazoned with Ronaldo, as well teammates Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema and Marcelo.

The aircraft is planned to travel to Hong Kong, Amsterdam and Frankfurt this week, giving Real Madrid fans in these countries a chance to snap a picture of the aircraft.

Emirates said the decal “will stay on the aircraft for six months traversing the globe to Emirates 36’ A380 destinations.

In July, the airline produced a similarly decorated plane for Premier League side Arsenal for their pre-season summer tour to Singapore - this time using a Boeing 777-200LR.

Speaking of new operators – TAM will be looking forward to delivery of their first A350.

This took a step forward with TAM’s first A350 taking to the skies.

TAM will be the fourth operator of the Airbus A350, and the launch operator of the type in the Americas. TAM itself is part to LATAM who have orders for 27 A350-900 aircraft in its TAM division

For Airbus, there is a tight schedule ahead to complete testing – as the aircraft is due for delivery in December and for TAM to begin operations in January.

In the first instance, TAM will operate services between Sao Paulo and Manaus inside Brazil. TAM will then expand its A350 operations to from Sao Paulo to Miami, Madrid and Orlando.

Flying in the back of the Airbus A350 – it’s a rather comfortable experience (certainly – I found it more pleasant than a Boeing 787), and I’m looking forward to seeing more of these aircraft in other operators hands.

2000 - Europe’s Airbus Industrie launched its A380 superjumbo project as the world’s largest passenger jet. The path is now clear for Airbus to begin working in earnest on bringing the 555-plus seat aircraft into production, with a view to first deliveries to airlines in early 2006. The plane has been touted for years under its A3XX codename, but Airbus renamed it the A380 in line with the nomenclature of all the other aircraft it has built since the late 1960s — the A300, A310, A320, A330 and A340. The break in sequencing this time around is because the ‘8’ in A380 is supposed to represent the double-deck cross section of the plane’s tubular hull. At a cost of $10.7 billion (Dh39.35 billion), Airbus and its shareholders must hope that interest in the plane does not fade.

Drivers barrelling along the D117 road past the Aéroport de Perpignan-Rivesaltes have grown used to the sight of the strikingly liveried Airbus parked next to the barbed-wired boundary for much of the last three years.

At 60 metres in length the A340 is one of the world’s larger jetliners. When it first landed at the airport in south-west France in 2012, it bore an enigmatic emblem on its tail of “9999” – along with a scattering of bullet holes. These days the logo has been replaced by the stylised flag bearing a crescent moon that announces it as the property of the state of Libya.

After the country’s civil war, countless Libyan aircraft crossed the Mediterranean in search of sanctuary. But as a symbol of grotesque luxury none matches Airbus 5A-One. Bought in 2006 from a Saudi prince for $120m, 5A-One was Muammar Gaddafi’s personal jet. And it is tricked out with all the baubles that any self-respecting despot would demand – silver leather sofas, a jacuzzi, a private cinema, a double bed and 50 first class-style seats in the back for a kowtowing entourage.

But it’s not just its Bond villain interior that sets it apart, or the fact that its owners include the former Libyan dictator butchered by his compatriots in his hometown of Sirte in 2011. The jet has another claim to notoriety: it is among the most legally contested aircraft in history.

Since being built in 1996, 5A-One has been owned not just by Libya’s Brother Leader but by two of the planet’s most high-profile plutocrats; and it has been at the centre of accusations from profligacy to subterfuge in at least seven separate lawsuits heard in courts from London to Cairo.

The latest chapter in this twisting legal saga was written this week when a French judge ruled that the aircraft was the sovereign property of Libya and so could not be seized by the latest claimant to its ownership, the Al Kharafi Group, a Kuwaiti conglomerate with interests from fertilisers to Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

The family-owned firm secured a ruling in Cairo two years ago that it was owed €935m as a result of a broken contract with the Gaddafi regime to build a beach resort in Libya. Lawyers for the Kuwaiti company sought the seizure of the jet, which they valued at €62m, as a down payment on the debt. But the French high court in Perpignan ruled that since 5A-One can be described as “presidential” equipment it benefits from sovereignty immunity and cannot be seized.

Carole Sportes, a Paris-based lawyer representing the internationally recognised Libyan government in Benghazi, said: “It is very satisfying to see the judge has recognised the fact that this plane, which belongs to the Libyan state, has immunity from being seized.”

Unsurprisingly for an object pored over by legal minds for much of its existence, the ruling is unlikely to end the courtroom wrangling. Rémi Barousse, the lawyer representing the Al Kharafi Group, told The Independent that he is considering appealing against the ruling, but he added: “For now, the plane remains at Perpignan.”

It is a peculiar quirk of Perpignan-Rivesaltes airport that 5A-One is not the only pale imitation of Air Force One to be found in front of the hangars of EAS Services, the company subcontracted to maintain Gaddafi’s jet while its ownership is resolved. Among the other jets lingering on the asphalt is the Boeing 727 of the President of Benin, who reputedly refuses to set foot in the 1970s relic, and another presidential 727, this time belonging to Mauritania, which arrived in 2004.

But there can be little doubt that 5A-One has by far the most colourful – and cursed – history of this bizarre, static display of avionic luxury.

When the jet arrived in Perpignan in August 2012, its pilots were forced to fly at barely a third of the usual cruising altitude, in a depressurised cockpit, and with the landing gear down. This was to ensure it was not torn apart by the bullet holes shot into the fuselage a year earlier, when it was captured by anti-Gaddafi rebels; these later formed one of the two rival governments that now compete to hold Libya together, in the face of squabbling militias and increasing threats from a franchise of Isis.

At a cost of £2.1m, the jet has been restored to flight worthiness, its “9999” paint scheme (a nod by Gaddafi to the creation under his tutelage of the African Union on 9 September 1999) replaced and its engines periodically fired to ensure it will be able to fly once any owner – old or new – pays the outstanding bill. Eye-watering expense has been its byword ever since 5A-One was wheeled out of the Airbus factory in Toulouse and delivered to Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei, whose contributions to human achievement include the purchase of a luxury yacht named “Tits” with its twin tenders “Nipple 1” and “Nipple 2”.

The prince, who denied claims that he embezzled $14.8bn from Brunei’s oil fund, spent $250m on the new A340 before it was seized and sold for a bargain $90m to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, a nephew of the former Saudi king Abdullah and one of the world’s richest men. When Prince Waleed, whose assets include the Savoy Hotel, found himself with an excess of jacuzzi-fitted jets in 2006, he offered it (or a potentate-friendly Boeing) to Gaddafi, who chose the Airbus after protracted negotiations.

The transaction spawned another legal dispute when Daad Sharab, a Jordanian businesswoman who acted as an intermediary on the deal, sued Prince Waleed in the High Court in London in 2013, for allegedly reneging on an agreement to pay her £6.5m in commission. Ms Sharab won her case after the judge accepted her account over that of the Saudi prince.

Under Gaddafi’s ownership, 5A-One was flown around the world as the Libyan dictator engineered a delicate thaw in relations with the West. In 2009, it arrived at Glasgow Airport to fly home the newly released Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi.

But its near four-year interlude at Perpignan, during which it has also attracted a lawsuit from the German airline Lufthansa, means 5A-One, the self-styled flagship of the Libyan people, has now spent more time on a French taxiway than in their service.

For now, it seems the Airbus will remain where it is – a sobering emblem of one man’s hubris and the wrangling over the remaining assets of the state that he brought to the brink of failure."
Indonesia inspects Airbus planes after AirAsia crash probe - Business Standard,"Thu, 03 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9wdGktc3Rvcmllcy9pbmRvbmVzaWEtaW5zcGVjdHMtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy1hZnRlci1haXJhc2lhLWNyYXNoLXByb2JlLTExNTEyMDMwMDY1M18xLmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3B0aS1zdG9yaWVzL2luZG9uZXNpYS1pbnNwZWN0cy1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzLWFmdGVyLWFpcmFzaWEtY3Jhc2gtcHJvYmUtMTE1MTIwMzAwNjUzXzEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



Indonesia's transport ministry today began inspecting all Airbus A320s registered in the country after a probe found a faulty component contributed to last year's crash of an AirAsia plane with the loss of 162 lives.The Airbus A320-200 plunged into the Java Sea in stormy weather on December 28, during what was supposed to be a routine flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.An Indonesian investigation released Tuesday found a fault with a system that helps control the rudder's movement, poor maintenance, and the crew's inadequate response when a problem occurred, were contributing factors to the crash of flight QZ8501.To prevent similar accidents, the transport ministry said 18 officials would conduct inspections on the 75 Airbus A320s registered in Indonesia -- with AirAsia and three other domestic airlines -- and expected to conclude the checks on June 2.""We will check the technical documents, the operation documents, then the plane itself, with a focus on the RTLU (Rudder Travel Limiter Unit),"" said Muhamad Alwi, the director of airworthiness at the transport ministry.The planes can still operate while the checks are being conducted but if any is found to have ""repetitive trouble"" with the rudder unit, then it will be grounded, said Suprasetyo, the head of the civil aviation directorate general, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.The probe, by the official National Transportation Safety Committee, showed that cracked soldering in the unit caused it to malfunction and send repeated warning messages to the pilots.In response, they tried to reset a computer system but in the process turned off the plane's autopilot, and then lost control of the aircraft.The component had suffered 23 problems in the 12 months prior to crash, with malfunctions occurring more frequently in the final three months, the probe found."

Airbus is getting serious about its plans to fly passengers from London to New York in just one hour. The aircraft manufacturer today filed a second patent for a supersonic plane will could take people between the two cities faster than it takes to drive across London. Pictured is an artist's impression of what it might look like

HOW WOULD IT REACH MACH 4.5? The patent drawings show two turbojet engines on either side of it of the plane's body, which would fly the aircraft to a certain altitude Once there, a huge rocket engine at the back of the plane would ignite, sending the plane vertically upwards to reach its final altitude. The initial boost will create a supersonic boom, and create drag on the vehicle which will be countered with anti-drag flaps. The flaps are designed to move in front of the jet engines when they are not in use so that the aircraft is more streamlined.

Business Insider points out that this is a major improvement on the 3.5 hours it took for the now Mach 2 Concorde to make the same trip.

Early illustrations for the jet were released in July, but now Airbus has revised its designs in a second patent, which include details of 'anti-drag' flaps.

The plane is described as 'a space aircraft capable of taking off from the ground in the usual manner, reaching an altitude of at least a hundred kilometers, flying at a transsonic or even supersonic speed, and then landing in the usual manner of an aircraft.'

It will be able to take off and land like a normal aircraft on a runway, while still being capable of flying at supersonic speeds at altitudes 'of at least 100 kilometers'.

In its original patent in July, Airbus said it had designed the craft's aerodynamics to limit sonic boom, which was a major problem for Concorde when it flew over land. Passengers on the aircraft will be limited to 20

HOW SCRAMJET ENGINES WORK Scramjets are 'airbreathing' aircraft because rather than carrying both fuel and the oxygen needed to provide acceleration, they carry only hydrogen fuel and 'pull' the oxygen needed to burn it from the atmosphere. Air is forced into the front of the engine and as hydrogen is injected into the airstream, the gases are compressed causing the temperature to rise and ignition to occur. This generates huge amounts of thrust and enables the jet to travel at speeds far in excess of the 1,350mph top speed of Concorde.

The initial boost will create a supersonic boom, and create drag on the vehicle which will be countered with anti-drag flaps.

The flaps are designed to move in front of the engines when they are not in use so that the aircraft is more streamlined.

Patent Yogi has today released a video showing how the latest application would work.

In its original patent in July, Airbus said it had designed the craft's aerodynamics to limit sonic boom, which was a major problem for Concorde when it flew over land.

Passengers on the aircraft will be limited to 20.

'In the case of civil applications, the market envisaged is principally that of business travel and VIP passengers, who require transcontinental return journeys within one day,' the original patent states.

Airbus thinks the jet would be able to complete trips such as Tokyo to Los Angeles in just three hours.

The aircraft manufacturer says the hypersonic jet could also be for military applications, working to transport soldiers at rapid speeds.

But Airbus isn't the only one vying to create hypersonic aircraft technology.

Earlier this year, Air Force bosses revealed they hope to have a hypersonic plane capable of crossing countries in minutes by 2023.

Several tests of hypersonic projectiles have already been carried out.

Air Force Chief Scientist Mica Endsley told Military.com that the Air Force and Darpa, the Pentagon's research entity, plan to have a new and improved hypersonic air vehicle by 2023.

Experimental unmanned aircraft developed for the U.S. Air Force have already gone hypersonic during tests off the Southern California coast, flying at more than five times the speed of sound.

The Air Force said a craft known as the X-51A WaveRider flew for more than three minutes under power from its exotic scramjet engine and hit a speed of Mach 5.1 last year.

The new air vehicle could be used to transport sensors, equipment or weaponry in the future, depending upon how the technology develops.

Previously bosses had only said they hoped that missile systems would be available for testing in 2020.

Qatar Airways aborts takeoff on first Airbus A350 flight from US - Daily Mail,"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvdHJhdmVsX25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0zMzU4MTAyL1FhdGFyLUFpcndheXMtYWJvcnRzLXRha2VvZmYtQWlyYnVzLUEzNTAtZmxpZ2h0LVVTLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL3RyYXZlbF9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMzM1ODEwMi9hbXAvUWF0YXItQWlyd2F5cy1hYm9ydHMtdGFrZW9mZi1BaXJidXMtQTM1MC1mbGlnaHQtVVMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was meant to celebrate an aircraft model’s first-ever journey from the US, but this Qatar Airways charter flight carrying journalists and staff didn’t go as planned.

Nerve-wracking footage shows the moment the Airbus A350-900 XWB abandoned its takeoff attempt as it sped along a runway at New York’s JFK Airport and came to a screeching halt.

Passengers were left shaken and confused – and some wanted to get off the plane – as they tried to figure out whether the plane stopped due to an emergency.

Aviation journalist Zach Honig said nearly all of the 200-plus pillows and blankets were tossed onto the floor

Thursday night's chartered flight from New York to Doha, Qatar, was carrying just 36 passengers as the airline became the first to operate an A350 from the US after flying in earlier in the week.

A video clip captured by aviation journalist Zach Honig, who was invited on the inaugural journey and was seated in one of 36 business class seats, shows the reactions of those on board when flight QR7452 came to a sudden halt on the runway.

Passengers watched the moment unfold as live footage from a forward-facing camera mounted on the plane's tail was beamed onto their in-flight entertainment screens.

In a blog entry, Honig, editor-in-chief of The Points Guy, described it as a ‘terrifying’ experience and ‘the most memorable flight of my life’.

He wrote on the website: ‘About 18 seconds after we began rolling down JFK’s runway 22R, the aircraft self-aborted, bringing us from more than 100mph to a loud, screeching halt in roughly 15 seconds.

‘For a plane of this size and weight, stopping that quickly required a lot of force. To give you another idea of how abruptly we stopped … nearly all of the 200-plus pillows and blankets landed on the floor, having previously been neatly arranged on each seat in economy.’

Honig told MailOnline Travel that the airline's chief operating officer assured passengers an ‘indicator’ was responsible for the aborted takeoff.

He said the executive told those on board that the A350’s computer system decided the 11,000ft runway was 'too short' and applied the brakes at full force on its own.

The Airbus A350 was becoming the first of its kind to fly from the US when the mishap occurred

When the plane halted, cabin crew told passengers to stay seated and assured them everything was fine

Two hours after the aborted takeoff the plane used a different runway and flew to Doha without incident

Honig provided updates on Twitter for his 9,600 followers after the plane came to its screeching halt

Cabin crew asked Honig to turn off his camera as he filmed the aborted takeoff and following moments

No one was injured but passengers were left shaken by the experience.

Honig said that he and a journalist seated next to him wanted to get off the plane in New York and skip the journey to Doha.

He tweeted about the experience while he was on board and received a phone call from his worried mother within minutes.

Honig said: 'She was just so scared and upset, and she made it very clear she would feel much more comfortable if I would get off the flight and not continue to Doha.'

Passengers were not allowed to disembark, Honig added.

He said: 'I’ve flown many times and I’ve never had an aborted takeoff. The first assumption is that something is seriously wrong with the plane.'

'I would have opted to [disembark] because I was thinking this is the first flight for this aircraft from this airport and already we’re not off to a good start.

It was the first time an A350 had used the runway at JFK.

Honig, a travel journalist and editor-in-chief of The Points Guy, said he wanted to get off the plane

No one was injured when the plane came to a stop, but Honig said he and others were left shaken

Honig said the airline's chief operating officer told those on board that the plane 'auto-braked'

After a two-hour delay the Airbus A350 took off and had an uneventful journey to Qatar's capital

Amid the confusion after the plane stopped, cabin crew told passengers to turn off their cameras and remain in their seats.

Honig was also asked to stop tweeting updates for his 9,600 followers.

In the video, a flight attendant is heard telling passengers ‘everything is fine’ as the plane begins to taxi along the runway at a slow speed.

Two hours later the plane took off on a different runway and made the 12-hour journey to Qatar’s capital without incident, Honig said.

His footage of the aborted takeoff was uploaded to YouTube, where it has more than 100,000 views.

A Qatar Airways spokesman declined to comment on the incident.

THE NEW AIRBUS A350 XWB As Airbus’ global launch customer, Qatar Airways became the first airline to use the A350 XWB last January and now has seven in its fleet with about 70 more on order. The A350-900 has been billed by Airbus as the ‘cornerstone member’ of the French manufacturer’s all-new A350 XWB aircraft. With a two-class configuration (business and economy) used by Qatar Airways, its A350 planes have a capacity of 283 passengers (36 in business and 247 in economy). Qatar Airways said the extra-wide cabin has been ergonomically designed for maximum space and comfort, with higher ceilings, large windows, mood lighting to minimise jet lag, lower cabin pressure, greater humidity control, and a system that filters the air on board every few minutes. It said the aircraft – powered by two new-generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines – are lighter, faster and more fuel efficient than those in the same category. Qatar Airways uses the next-generation planes to fly between Doha and Dubai, Frankfurt, Munich and Singapore. They will begin flying to Philadelphia in January, Boston and New York in March, and Adelaide, Australia, in May.

It was an embarrassing moment for Qatar Airways after its chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, trumpeted the plane's arrival and outlined the airline's expansion into the US at a news conference in New York.

At the same press conference, Baker claimed runway overruns 'happen quite often' while speaking to journalists, including Honig, about an incident involving one of the airline's planes in Miami last September.

A preliminary investigation found the Doha-bound Boeing 777-300ER, with four pilots in the cockpit, overran the runway and clipped approach lights as it took off, resulting in an 18in tear in its fuselage and a breach of the pressure vessel.

The report by Qatar's civil aviation authority found the flight crew misread information on a tablet computer and did not take off using the full length of the runway.

The preliminary report said: 'The crew reported that as they lined up they were not visual with the end of the runway nor were they aware they had approximately 1,000m of runway behind them.'

The plane was carrying 259 passengers and 20 crew, and continued uneventfully to Doha, where it landed 13.5 hours later.

According to the report, none of the crew was aware that the plane had struck the runway approach lights.

Despite the findings, Baker blamed air traffic control.

Baker has been in a nasty feud with chief executives from US airlines which have called for a limit on flights by Gulf carriers, claiming they have an unfair advantage because they are subsidised by their governments.

In an interview with USA Today Baker took shots at Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson, saying the US airline executive's claims are 'baloney'.

Baker added: 'And it is just to protect his backside so he can swindle American passengers more and more, reduce capacity, and keep on increasing his market share.

'I am ready to challenge Anderson. Let him come face to face with me in any forum, and I will hang him on the wall.'"
"INC denies owning jet, bank accounts - Inquirer.net","Fri, 04 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmF0aW9uLmlucXVpcmVyLm5ldC8xMzMzMTMvaW5jLWRlbmllcy1vd25pbmctamV0LWJhbmstYWNjb3VudHPSAVBodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbG5hdGlvbi5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvMTMzMzEzL2luYy1kZW5pZXMtb3duaW5nLWpldC1iYW5rLWFjY291bnRzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) does not own luxurious private planes, the church’s spokesperson said on Thursday in response to allegations the sect owned an Airbus 330-202 and a Boeing executive jet which the INC leadership supposedly used on trips abroad.

Expelled INC ministers Isaias Samson Jr. and Vincent Florida accused church leaders of committing irregularities in the handling of cash donations from US-based churches that were allegedly deposited in offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland.

‘He can have it’

Samson said the cash was flown to those places in the private planes own-ed by the INC, both of which reportedly cost between $200 million and $250 million (approximately P9.5 billion to P12 billion).

“If Samson can prove the church owns an Airbus 330-202, or any other airplane for that matter, then he can have it,” Zabala said.

Zabala hurled a similar challenge at Samson and Florida regarding the alleged offshore accounts in the Caymans and Switzerland.

He said church leaders were willing to sign a waiver allowing the two or an investigator to inquire about the INC with the proper authorities in the Cayman Islands and in Switzerland.

Audit protocols

Zabala said the INC had very stringent audit protocols that enabled it to meet the strict tax-exempt status requirements of the United States.

“We follow protocols in the deposit of cash collections. We also have very stringent audit procedures, otherwise the church would not be granted tax exempt status by the US government,” he said.

Zabala said the offerings from church members were properly audited and went to the construction of churches and to the various INC socio-civic activities. He said more than 800 churches had been constructed in different parts of the world under the leadership of Executive Minister Eduardo Manalo.

Saddened

The spokesperson said the INC was saddened by the statements of Samson and Florida, who were expelled from the church in July.

Zabala suspected that Samson and the other former ministers who had been attacking the INC “may be part of a systematic, planned effort to discredit the church.”"
Bluecopter flights end without tests of single-engine operation - Flightglobal,"Wed, 02 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYmx1ZWNvcHRlci1mbGlnaHRzLWVuZC13aXRob3V0LXRlc3RzLW9mLXNpbmdsZS1lbmdpbmUtb3BlcmF0aW9uLzExOTA1Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has ended test flights of its Bluecopter eco-demonstrator having successfully validated a number of technologies to cut fuel burn by 12-15%.

However, trials of single engine operation (SEO) – which promised a further 25% improvement in fuel consumption – have been pushed into next year due to an unexpected level of complexity with the initiative.

The airframer unveiled the European Commission-backed programme during the summer. The programme took an early prototype of Airbus's EC135 light twin (D-HEXE) and added new features including enhanced rotor blades, a next-generation Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, and an active rudder, all of which are designed to cut fuel consumption, CO2 output and noise emissions.

But the biggest gains were promised by SEO, or the ability to shut down one of the two engines in the cruise phase of flight.

However, Marius Bebesel, director of the programme, says the challenge of adding control software to the avionics and FADEC engine systems proved “rather tricky”.

“That is why we are a little bit delayed. We will probably continue these SEO measurements next year, but they will not be directly in the frame of the Bluecopter project,” he says.

Dominic Perry/Flightglobal

That programme effectively finishes at year-end, he says, with the demonstrator having amassed around 65 flight hours.

Instead, test flights are likely to resume in mid-2016 using the same airframe, but with the addition of the SEO system, alongside new engine side inlets and improved main rotors.

Bluecopter was fitted with a five-blade system using longer, hockey stick Blue Edge-style blades. However, Bebesel declines to reveal what the next iterative development of the rotors will look like.

Additionally, any future tests of SEO will be conducted with an engine manufacturer, says Bebesel. Although the Bluecopter demonstrator is powered by twin Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206 turboshafts, he says there was “no real co-operation” on the initiative with the propulsion specialist.

“But the next step will be to go for co-operation with Pratt & Whitney [Canada] or [alternative supplier] Turbomeca or both on the topic,” he says.

The main challenge will be to define with operators what level of complexity they require from the system, particularly around restart of the shut-down engine.

A powerful restart generator, allowing the engine to be brought back up quickly, would incur a “cost and weight penalty” compared with a simple switch, Bebesel says, but could be used in a “bigger window” of the flight profile, he says.

The Bluecopter initiative’s second goal was to reduce noise emissions by a cumulative 30dB, and although it hit its targets in the take-off and landing phases, where it is “world champion” says Bebesel, further work is required for the fly over element of trials, where the “results were good, but we expected even better”.

Accident: Services Air A313 at Mbuji-Mayi on Dec 24th 2015, runway excursion on landing

By Simon Hradecky, created Thursday, Dec 24th 2015 22:54Z, last updated Tuesday, Dec 29th 2015 17:22Z





Witnesses reported the crew had already attempted and aborted two approaches, on the third approach the aircraft touched down about half way down the runway and was unable to stop before the end of the runway and came to a stop on soft ground about 500 meters/1650 feet past the runway end.



The provincial governor reported on Dec 24th 2015 there were 7 fatalities on the ground. On Dec 25th 2015 he added that there were 8 victims, 7 women and a boy. The runway overrun is being attributed to weather, not to the runway surface condition.



On Dec 29th 2015 the French BEA reported in their bulletin, that 8 people on the ground were killed and 9 people on the ground received serious injuries when the aircraft overran the runway. The aircraft carrying 5 crew received substantial damage. The Accident Investigation Board of the Democratic Republic of Congo is investigating the accident.



No weather data (neither METAR nor local weather station data) are available. Local media described the weather at the time of the accident as rainy with visibility near zero.



Mbuji-Mayi Airport features a runway 17/35 of 2000 meters/6560 feet length.



Mbuji-Mayi had been known for poor runway surface conditions at the latest since Aug 19th 2015, see

A complex supply chain - Inside Logistics,"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWxvZ2lzdGljcy5jYS9mZWF0dXJlcy8xNDI4MzIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft manufacturer Airbus inaugurated its first US assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, on September 14 this year. Located alongside the Mobile airport on a 215,000-square-metre footprint, this brand-new plant is scheduled to deliver its first A320 in the spring of 2016 and reach four A320s monthly by 2018.

The European Airbus consortium was born in 1967 during a meeting of ministers from France, Germany and Britain at a time when Boeing dominated the industry.

Britain eventually pulled out and Spain became a partner in the project in 1971. Airbus’s first aircraft, the A300 twin-engine short- to medium-range wide-body passenger jet, flew its inaugural flight in Toulouse, France on October 28, 1972.

By the 1990s, the competition between Airbus and Boeing resulted in a duopoly in the large jet airliner market, as Boeing absorbed its rival, McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and other manufacturers, such as Lockheed Martin, Convair, Fairchild, British Aerospace and Fokker withdrew from this market.

Today, although the figures vary as new models come on stream, Airbus and Boeing account for approximately 85 percent of the market, with the smaller Bombardier, Embraer, Tupolev and Comac sharing the balance.

Rolled-out in 1987, the A320 became the best-selling jetliner aircraft family ever. The A320 family is based on a common aircraft type with the same wide cabin cross-section, available in four fuselage lengths: the A320 holding 150 seats; the A321 holding 186; the A319 with 124; and the “baby” of the family, the A318, with 107.

This comprehensive range enables Airbus customers to build a fleet with maximum flexibility, operating similar aircraft across the whole range of sectors, switching cross-qualified pilots and crews on short notice according to needs. This reduces maintenance costs as well, a significant benefit for airlines.

Having its first production lines split between two countries, France and Germany, with major components originating as well from the UK and Spain, and a worldwide array of suppliers, Airbus had to operate first-class supply chain management from day one.

Today, Airbus has its own operations in seven countries and three continents. Major components for the A320 family originate from St-Nazaire, France (forward centre and forward fuselages); Nantes, France (wing box); Saint Eloi, France (engine pylons); Hamburg, Germany (centre fuselage and tailcone); Bremen, Germany (flaps); Stade, Germany (vertical stabilizers); Broughton, UK (wings); and, Getafe, Spain (horizontal stabilizers).

Final assembly lines are located in Toulouse, France (A320) and in Hamburg, Germany (A321, A319 and A318). A third assembly line began operations in Tianjin, China in September 2008. The first jetliner completed at the Tianjin facility had its maiden flight in May 2009 and was delivered to Sichuan Airlines the following month.

Major components are usually shipped from manufacturing sites to final assembly plants by sea. When time is critical, Airbus can airlift them with its own fleet of purpose-built air freighters called the A300-600ST and nicknamed the “Beluga”, because of its resemblance to the white Arctic whale. Airbus currently operates five of these super-sized transporter jets, flying components and parts between the UK, Spain, France, Germany and China.

So the inauguration of an Airbus final assembly plant in Alabama in September illustrates their strategy of building additional capacity to reduce lead times, increase flexibility and get closer to market. Alabama was selected thanks to its aerospace expertise, competitive labour force and its world-class port in Mobile, capable of handling aircraft fuselages arriving by vessel from Airbus’s Hamburg site.

Having some production costs in US dollars is also advantageous for Airbus as it provides protection against exchange rate fluctuations, since worldwide aircraft sales are generally labelled in US dollars. Of course, another reason for making this US$600 million investment across the Atlantic is the marketing benefit with US airlines of being a “local” manufacturer.

The US market is huge, as several airlines need to renew their aging fleet and the market for single-aisle aircraft of the A320 type is estimated at over 4,700 new planes in the next 20 years. Airbus’s and Boeing’s worldwide market share are very close but Boeing remains the market leader in the US, where Airbus only has about 20 percent share. However, their objective of 50 percent appears reachable as they are currently getting around 40 percent of new US orders.

Airbus already has several US airlines as customers, the biggest ones being Delta Airlines and United Airlines and the first A320 scheduled to come out of the Mobile assembly line is destined to jetBlue, with the second going to American Airlines.

Boeing has meantime embarked on a similar strategy, as it agreed, during the visit of President Xi Jinping to the US in September, to build a B737 final assembly plant in China.
