Airbus' Parent Company Showcases Algae Powered Flights - WIRED,"Wed, 09 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEwLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1wYXJlbnQtY29tcGFueS1zaG93Y2FzZXMtYWxnYWUtcG93ZXJlZC1mbGlnaHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EADS, the parent company of Airbus, and Diamond Aircraft are making demonstration flights this week of first ever aircraft powered entirely by an algae derived biofuel. The small, twin engine Diamond DA42NG is making the flights at the Berlin Air show all week to showcase the new fuel. EADS says the new fuel is not only renewable, but it reduces fuel burn as well as pollutants.

Hardly a month seems to go by that somebody in the aviation world isn't demonstrating a new biofuel flight. The military has flown fighter jets on biofuel and several airlines have flownaircraft as big as 747s on various types and concentrations of biofuel. But EADS and Diamond Aircraft opted for a much more understated aircraft, with perhaps a more impressive fuel as a way to throw their hats in the alternative fuel ring.

The DA42NG is a four seat, twin engine airplane most commonly used for training pilots who plan to move on to the airlines. Diamond made headlines with the airplane several years ago when it first debuted with diesel powered engines that can burn the same fuel as jet powered aircraft (diesel and Jet-A are very similar fuels).

As a testing platform, the DA42NG is an attractive aircraft because the fuel requirements are the same as the larger jet engines, but obviously the smaller airplane is much less expensive and easier to operate.

According to EADS, the twin engine airplane is making the demonstration flights in Berlin using 100 percent biofuel. It can achieve the same performance while burning 1.5 liters (0.4 gallons) less fuel per hour compared to normal operations using the traditional Jet-A fuel. Depending on the power setting used for the flights, that is roughly 5-10 percent more efficient. The company also says the algae based fuel produces 40 percent less nitrogen oxides than conventional jet fuel.

""This opens up the feasibility of carbon-neutral flights"" Dr. Jean Botti, EADS chief technical officer said in a statement. ""Third generation biofuels are more than just a replacement for fossil petroleum - they push the possibilities of future propulsion.""

EADS says it is working towards a pilot project to develop the infrastructure needed for a pilot project producing algae based biofuel. The european consortium of aviation companies makes everything from helicopters to the A380 that could potentially run on alternative fuels. After initial testing with the DA42NG, the company plans to expand testing to larger aircraft.

The world's largest passenger plane has proven to be the most expensive civilian airplane ever developed. Airbus claims its fuel efficiency, control system and sound-reduction technology also make it the most advanced airliner ever built. The first-class section sets standards in luxury, but the A380 began service during a global recession. ""They're going to see years of losses before that [luxury] market fully materializes,"" says investment consultant Paul Nisbet, president of JSA Research. Some carriers deferred airplane deliveries, while Qantas ripped out its first-class A380 cabins for ones with cheaper seats.

The Dreamliner travels the same distance as the A380 at the same speed but carries half the passengers. The airliner's $10 billion development suffered from more than two years of delays, costing the company orders and credibility. Regardless, the versatility of Boeing's airplane has interested a steady stream of buyers. The Dreamliner's small size, quick flight-turnaround times and fuel economy account for its sales advantage over the A380. With a maiden flight under its belt in December 2009 and a crucial wing test passed in March, Boeing could deliver its first 787 by the end of this year."
Dubai-based Emirates to order 32 Airbus A380 aircraft - FRANCE 24 English,"Tue, 08 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMDYwOC1kdWJhaS1iYXNlZC1lbWlyYXRlcy1vcmRlci0zMi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1haXJjcmFmdC1hdmlhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

Dubai-based airline Emirates has announced an order of 32 more Airbus A380 planes, taking the company's total order to 90. Estimated at more than 11 billion dollars, Tuesday's order becomes the biggest contract in civil aviation history, says Airbus.

AFP - Dubai airline Emirates announced on Tuesday an order for 32 A380 ""superjumbos"" for 11.5 billion dollars, the biggest contract in civil aviation history according to the aircraft's maker Airbus.



The A380 order, which takes to 90 the number ordered by Emirates, ""shows our confidence in the future growth"" of the airline industry, chief executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said at the Berlin Air Show (ILA).



""It's the largest order ever placed for civil aircraft by dollar value based on catalogue prices in aviation history,"" said John Leahy, chief commercial officer at Airbus.



Emirates was the first airline to order the huge A380, which was the main attraction at the ILA starting on Tuesday. It has already taken delivery of 10 of the aircraft.



Franco-German Airbus, the arch rival of US giant Boeing, has gone months without receiving any confirmations of orders for the A380 or any new contracts for the plane as airlines have wrestled with the global recession.



Louis Gallois, chief executive of parent company EADS, said in a recent media interview that orders for the A380 would not properly take off again until 2011 or 2012 as airlines put the downturn behind them.



The International Air Transport Association (IATA) provided some cheer on Monday with a prediction that the sector should be profitable this year for the first time since 2007.

"Inside the Cockpit of a ""Grizzly"" Airbus - Fox News","Tue, 08 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RlY2gvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1jb2NrcGl0LW9mLWEtZ3JpenpseS1haXJidXPSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS90ZWNoL2luc2lkZS10aGUtY29ja3BpdC1vZi1hLWdyaXp6bHktYWlyYnVzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A400M won't change how German troops land in a place like Afghanistan -- but it will change how fast they can get there.

Touching down in a war zone, and especially a war zone flung across the Hindu Kush, is not for the fainthearted. First, you never know which way the pilot will choose to descend. If he goes for a combat descent, the plane will dive out of the sky, dipping its nose sharply toward the ground.

Sitting sideways on a bench on the Transall C-160, the A400M's chubby-nosed predecessor, your slide toward the front of the plane is stopped only by a simple strap around your belly. You feel a violent pressure in your ears. This is normally the moment when even the last sleepers wake. It is also the moment you might hear an explosion or two near the wings -- hot flares fired off to lure away any heat-seeking rockets shot at the plane.

Other times the pilot brings the plane down by executing a steep, tight corkscrew maneuver. Sometimes he descends by flying straight and turning corners, as if flying along the edges of a box. Other landings are as smooth and easy as the touchdown of a commercial airliner at the airport of a holiday resort.

The element of surprise is deliberate: pilots in war try to avoid patterns.

Airlift is the long arm of military power. It is about getting boots and amour on the ground fast and then keeping supply lines open. ""If you can move troops and weapons quickly, it is one of the adages of war that you can do things with relative ease on day one that by day 50 are much more difficult,"" says Air Chief Marshall Sir Brian Burridge, who led British forces into Iraq in 2003 and is now at Italian defense firm Finmeccanica.

LEFT FOR THE LADIES

Everybody loves the Transall, but it struggles to get boots on the ground where it matters in 2010. Built during the cold war to serve in the European theater, it has a short range, limited capacity and only two engines. Crucially, it cannot travel to the German camp in the northern Afghan town of Feyzabad because the climb out of the deep mountain valley presents too many risks for a plane with just two engines.

Right now, the Germans have to fly to Feyzabad in transport helicopters which means a terrain-hugging flight 8 to 10 meters above the ground across mountains and valleys. If the soldiers want less of a roller coaster ride, they catch a lift on one of the four-engined Hercules owned by the U.S. or Canada.

Inside, the Transall, a Franco-German joint venture which ended production in 1985, is pretty raw: naked craftsmanship without the nice covers, seats and carpets you expect on a commercial plane. Parachutes and ancient breathing devices hang from the walls of the plane.

There's no proper toilet. If you really need to go then head to the back of the plane and, right before the back ramp, turn left if you're a woman, right if you're a man. The loadmaster will flip down a plastic device for you, a kind of toilet seat with a box underneath, and pull a curtain for privacy.

It's not as bad as it sounds -- you just have to make sure the curtain stays closed and the plane doesn't fly into turbulence.

The A400M won't be a huge step up -- military planes are not built for luxury. But where it matters -- range and size -- the new transporter can't come soon enough."

I WILL POST THE ANSWERS TOMORROW (JUNE 8th) MORNING. I have locked it down so no more comments can be made.



Hawaiian Airlines is making a big change. They are adding an Airbus A330 to their fleet. On Friday June 4th the first passenger flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles will commence, starting a new era.

The new A330 is named Makali’˜i for the constellation Pleiades that helped guide ancient Polynesian voyagers across the Pacific.

This is one amazing photo and quite a few things are impressive. What got my attention (besides the fact this is Hawaiian’s newest and oldest aircraft together), is the Airbus A330 has a lei on it.

See it? Those purple/pink flowers right behind the cockpit? I wrote to Hawaiian PR guy Patrick Dugan and asked, “How many flowers does it take to lei an Airbus A330?” Guess what he told me? No, seriously guess…

CONTEST: How many flowers (they are dendrobium orchids, if that matters) did it take to create the lei (just the lei on the A330, not the stairs or other flowers) seen in the photo (bigger version) on the Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A330?

The closest person(s) to the correct answer will win a prize (I have a few you can choose from). You can leave a comment or you can email me at da***@ai*************.com (don’t worry I am not collecting emails in any fashion). I will give you until Monday June 7th at 5pm PST, then I will give the answer and announce the winner(s)!

System security is focus for e-enabled A350 XWB - Flightglobal,"Tue, 01 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc3lzdGVtLXNlY3VyaXR5LWlzLWZvY3VzLWZvci1lLWVuYWJsZWQtYTM1MC14d2IvOTM2ODUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Airbus works to ensure its A350 XWB is not vulnerable to hackers, it has raised some of the burning questions that must be answered before e-enabled airliners are brought to market.

In recent years the US and European certification authorities have expressed their concerns about security of e-enabled aircraft such as the A350, A380, Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8, through certification review items and special conditions.

The main novelty, according to Airbus, is the use of digital system architecture composed of several connected networks/domains - flight safety-related control, communication and navigation systems; airline business and administrative support; and passenger information and entertainment - and the concern that these networks may be subject to unauthorised access.

""As a consequence, 'connectivity' has to be taken in a scope wider than only cabin connectivity, including all kinds of communication [ground system to aircraft systems and aircraft systems to aircraft systems],"" said Airbus vice-president, cabin design office Jonathan Norris at a recent World Airline Entertainment Association (WAEA) single focus workshop.

While regulators are concerned that unauthorised people could use in-flight connectivity to hack into on-board systems while physically on board the aircraft, their greater concern is that unauthorised individuals would get into the systems via Gatelink on the ground and load a ""false flight management system"", Norris says.

As for managing off-board communications, Airbus wants answers to the following:

Which air-ground (ground-ground) links shall be supported? If this link is shared with cockpit communications, have all necessary studies been done to ensure aircraft performance and security are not affected by such connectivity traffic?

Are applicable certification rules for new e-enabled aircraft (A350, 787, 747-8) that require segregation between cabin and operational communications met?

To these two points, Airbus has been an advocate for having ""a very clean line of segregation"", says Norris, noting that ""it could be hardware segregation or software segregation"".

With respect to managing on-board wireless signals functions, Airbus asks:

Are the proposed wireless frequencies to be used in line with regulatory standards and Airbus directives?

Are wireless communications used (or planned) by other maintenance, cabin or cockpit applications? If ""yes"", Airbus wants to ensure that aircraft performance is not affected, and to secure ""the evolution and co-existence of several wireless systems on board as well as continuous compliance to regulatory requirements"", says Norris.

Emirates places biggest A380 order - CBC.ca,"Tue, 08 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2VtaXJhdGVzLXBsYWNlcy1iaWdnZXN0LWEzODAtb3JkZXItMS45NDgyOTDSAR9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuOTQ4Mjkw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai-based airline Emirates has ordered another 32 Airbus A380 ""superjumbo"" jets, the largest-ever order for the world's biggest passenger airplane.

An Airbus A380 approaches Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, on a test flight in 2005.

The $11.5 billion deal would give Emirates 90 of the planes by 2017, and give the upstart carrier more seats on intercontinental routes than British Airways and Air France combined.

The airline received its first A380 in July 2008. It currently has 10 in its fleet, with another 48 already on order before Tuesday's announcement.

The order ""affirms Emirates' strategy to become a world-leading carrier and to further establish Dubai as a central gateway to worldwide air travel,"" said Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum.

The pact also gives the Toulouse, France-based planemaker a boost, as its tries to turn hype surrounding its massive plane into financial gains.

Airbus's chief operating officer, John Leahy, said the company now has 234 firm orders for the superjumbo, with 30 planes already delivered and a total of 17 customers.

He hinted the company is in negotiations with several other airlines for A380 orders, but he declined to name names.

Boon for Airbus

The company's ambitious A380 program has been beset by numerous production and financial delays since it was first proposed in 2005. After originally hoping the superjumbo would be the company's salvation, Airbus is now targeting to break even by 2015 on the project.

Later Tuesday, Airbus announced a separate order from TAM of Brazil for 20 of its A320 single-aisle jets and five more of the A350 XWB widebody planes that the company is developing — an order with a catalog value of $2.9 billion.

Deliveries of the A320s will start in 2014 and the A350s are slated to start arriving in 2016. TAM already has 44 A320s and 22 A350s on order."

Unlike the massive A380, this four engine airplane has just one seat. But the airplane has caught the attention of the aviation world because it is the first electric powered, fully aerobatic four engine airplane to take to the skies.

Based on the tiny twin engine Cri-Cri airplane developed by Michael Colomban in France during the 1970s, the new electric version is being touted by EADS as a technology demonstrator. Like the original, the airplane is capable of aerobatic maneuvers and the company claims a flight time of up to 30 minutes. The original aluminum structure was replaced with a composite airframe to help compensate for the extra weight of the batteries.

With a wingspan of just under 13 feet, the Cri-Cri has held the title of the world's smallest twin engine airplane since it was first developed. The latest gasoline burning version is powered by a pair of 15 horsepower engines. The design has a faithful following, mostly in Europe and has even been modified to fly with small jet engines.

The electric Cri-Cri features four brushless electric motors with counter rotating propellers and lithium batteries. EADS said in a press release the first flight tests are expected this week.

According to Airbus the aircraft manufacturer now has 234 firm orders for the A380 from 17 customers, with Emirates alone accounting for 90 superjumbo orders, or just under 40 per cent of the worldwide total.

Emirates says it is now the second largest airline in the world in available seat kilometres, and adds that in addition to the orders placed today, the carrier has 48 Airbus A380s, 70 Airbus A350s, 18 Boeing 777-300ERs and 7 Boeing air freighters on order totalling 143 wide-body aircraft worth more than US$48 billion.

The airline took delivery of its tenth A380 on June 7, and currently serves eight destinations with the superjumb - London Heathrow, Toronto, Paris, Jeddah, Bangkok, Seoul, Sydney and Auckland. Beijing will be added to the list on August 1, followed by Manchester on September 1, and the return of the A380 on the New York route from October 1.

Its list price is around 100 million euros for domestic buyers.

Here are details on the pan-European airlifter, nicknamed the ""grizzly"" by test crew after its burly design.

WHO WILL BUY THE A400M?

-- Mostly European NATO nations, though Malaysia also wants four planes. Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey recently won a 10 percent price increase which will come through a mixture of fresh money, longer delivery timetables or fewer planes for the same price.

Here is a table of buyer nations

NOTES:

*In 2009 South Africa canceled an order for 8 A400Ms and said it would withdraw from the program.

**In March Britain said it would reduce its order to 22 from 25:

*** Germany has said it will reduce the number of A400Ms it has ordered to keep costs down.

DESIGN:

-- The A400M is the first high-wing aircraft with a T-shaped tail ever built by Airbus, known for its classic low-wing airliners. Some 30 percent of the wide-body plane is made of weight-saving carbon-fiber composites including most of the wings. As on many modern airliners, pilots control the plane using electronics or ""fly-by-wire"" systems.

ENGINES:

-- The plane's four 11,000-shaft-horsepower P400-D6 engines were developed by a European team including Rolls-Royce, Safran and MTU Aero Engines. A local engine was chosen after governments vetoed Airbus's choice of an imported engine made by Pratt & Whitney Canada.

PROPELLERS:

-- Each engine has eight Ratier-Figeac propeller blades measuring 5 meters tip-to-tip. The scimitar-shaped blades on each pair of engines rotate in opposite directions -- one clockwise and one anti-clockwise. That makes the wings more efficient and saves weight, enabling the plane to fly with a smaller rudder. If all the engines turned in the same direction and one failed, a much bigger rudder would be needed to keep the plane stable.

SOFTWARE:

-- Much attention has been given to crucial engine software, known as FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control). Writing and documenting the software to civil certification standards proved a daunting task and contributed to delays. The code was twice as long as that on the world's largest civil jet engine.

PAYLOAD VS RANGE:

-- With a typical 20-ton payload, the A400M can fly 3,450 nautical miles. With 30 tonnes on board its range is 2,450 nm.

WHAT IT CAN CARRY:

-- The 340 cubic meter hold can carry an NH-90 transport helicopter, or a CH-47 Chinook, or a container truck or two infantry vehicles.

-- In emergencies it has room for 125 stretchers plus an intensive care unit. It can hold 116 soldiers or fully equipped paratroopers.

-- Airbus says the A400M's size allows it to combine strategic and tactical roles, but competitors say this makes little sense as the competing Lockheed C-130J and Boeing C-17 already overlap.

WHERE IT CAN LAND:

-- Airbus says the 12-wheel landing gear allows the A400M to land on soft and rough airstrips as short as 750 meters (2,500 feet).

SPEED AND HEIGHT:

-- The maximum speed of Mach 0.72 corresponds to 420 knots ""true air speed"" at medium altitude. At low altitudes it can slow to less than 110 knots to refuel helicopters -- that is 20 knots slower than the approach speed of a small jetliner. A knot is one nautical mile per hour.

TANKER:

-- It doubles as a refueling tanker and can be refueled midair itself.

COMPETITION:

The A400M fits into a niche between the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules turbo-prop and the Boeing C-17, which is also capable of landing on semi-prepared airstrips. In practice all three compete to some extent, market experts say.

A spokesman for Lockheed Martin said the C-130J, a modernized version of which first flew in 1996, can carry 95 percent of what the A400M is specified to do.

Following plans to offer daily flights on its Vancouver-Shanghai route throughout the summer, China Eastern Airlines announced Monday it would be offering the service permanently beginning Nov. 1.

From June 20 through Sept. 10, the Shanghai-based carrier is offering a daily flight leaving Shanghai at 2.30 p.m. and arriving in the Canadian city at 10.30 a.m. on the same day. The plane will then depart Vancouver at 12.20 p.m. and arrive in Shanghai the following day at 3.25 p.m.

For China-bound passengers, the airline will provide complimentary connecting to flights to 40 major cities in the country. For those who can't make a connecting flight on their arrival day, China Eastern will provide free hotel accommodation in Shanghai.

Speaking at the Vancouver airport Monday, Margaret Meng, China Eastern's chief executive officer, said the daily service was needed as the flights on the Airbus A340 aircraft, were currently running at 80 to 85 percent capacity. The summer flights were expected to be at 90 percent capacity or higher.

She also cited the Approved Destination Status (ADS) that was granted to Canada in December. The status, which is currently in the final steps of approval, will make it easier for Chinese tourists to visit Canada.

Meng said Vancouver's hosting of the Winter Olympics earlier this year had only increased the importance of the city's ""gateway position to Asia, as evidenced by the increasing post-Games trip activities between China and Canada.""

She also mentioned a television survey that reported more than 850 million Chinese had watched some of the Winter Olympics and that last year Chinese visitor arrivals in Canada were 130 percent greater than the 1997 figure.

""Once the ADS agreement has been finalized between the two countries, the figure will increase by leaps and bounds,"" Meng said, adding she hoped Canadians would take the opportunity to visit the World Expo, currently ongoing in Shanghai."

The comments come after French prosecutors announced overnight they would not press charges over the November 27, 2008 crash near Perpignan.

A report prepared for a French judicial inquiry found the Air New Zealand plane lost control and crashed, killing the two German pilots and five New Zealanders on board, as the crew tried to perform a low-speed test ""in inappropriate conditions"".

The report essentially agreed with the findings of an interim report issued last year by Paris-based Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA), which found the plane stalled during a low-speed, low-altitude test manoeuvre as it was coming in to land at Perpignan airport.

It said the plane should have been flying at an altitude of 5200 metres to carry out the manoeuvre, but was instead at 600m."

Air NZ slams 'speculative' comments made over Airbus crash - New Zealand Herald,"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L256L2Fpci1uei1zbGFtcy1zcGVjdWxhdGl2ZS1jb21tZW50cy1tYWRlLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLWNyYXNoLzM1SUxBVkpOWEwySEdOQ01RR0lCWVUySlFVL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo / Supplied

Air New Zealand has hit out at an aviation safety specialist's interpretation of what went on before an Airbus A320 crashed into the Mediterranean off France in 2008, calling his comments ""speculative and baseless"".



A report prepared for a French judicial inquiry found the Air New Zealand plane lost control and crashed, killing the two German pilots and five New Zealanders on board, as the crew tried to perform a low-speed test ""in inappropriate conditions"".



The report essentially agreed with the findings of an interim report by Paris-based Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA), which found the plane stalled during a low-speed, low-altitude test manoeuvre as it was coming in to land at Perpignan airport.



Aviation safety specialist David Learmount, from the FlightGlobal website, said the interim report laid out the facts but left ""loads of questions unanswered"".



Air New Zealand crew in the cockpit encouraged the German pilots to carry out a low-speed test after air traffic controllers denied a request to carry out the test at higher altitude, he said.



Those on board were frustrated they had not been able to complete testing, and he felt Air New Zealand crew pushed for tests that contributed to the crash, he said.



""The vast majority of what happened here was to do with human frustration at not being able to get a job done, trying to get it done at a lower altitude than they should have done, and then getting into trouble,"" he told Radio New Zealand.



Air New Zealand told NZPA said it was ""irresponsible"" of Mr Learmount ""to make speculative and baseless claims about what he thinks may have taken place in the cockpit of the A320 in November 2008"".



Voice data showed there had been discussion about the low speed check well before the German pilot begun the test at his own initiative, the airline said.



""To suggest the Air New Zealand crew ""encouraged"" this in an environment of frustration is simply misleading.""



Only one Air New Zealand staff member was in the cockpit, and he was fulfilling an observation role only, the airline said.



Frustration among the pilots was not reflected in the BEA report, or on the partial transcript of the voice data recorder, it said.



""Air New Zealand would encourage Mr Learmount to wait until the final judicial and BEA reports are completed before commenting on what may have caused the accident. His speculation is irresponsible and shows a lack of respect to those affected by the tragedy.""



Airline chief executive Rob Fyfe and operations and safety general manager Captain David Morgan were briefed on the judicial investigation in a confidential meeting in France yesterday.



The New Zealanders killed in the crash were Air New Zealand pilot Brian Horrell, 52, Air New Zealand engineers Murray White, 37, Michael Gyles, 49, and Noel Marsh, 35, and Civil Aviation Authority official Jeremy Cook, 58.



The bodies were recovered from the crash scene.



French prosecutor Domnique Alzeari told reporters in Perpignan that his office had no plans to indict anyone in the manslaughter investigation that was opened in the wake of the crash.



The plane had gone to France for tests and to be repainted before heading to Germany, from where it was scheduled to leave for New Zealand.



Mr Alzeari noted that families of the victims or other parties had three months in which to request alternative expert opinions on the causes of the crash.



An examining judge and lawyers for various parties involved will now study the experts' report and any further expert opinion that may be submitted.



Built in 2005, the plane had been leased to German charter firm XL Airways since 2006. It had been undergoing servicing at EAS Industries in Perpignan and had been flying test circuits before it crashed.

It has a fleet of only Airbus A320’s and A319’s. The airline was founded in 1969 at a time that Indonesia was re-building a devastated economy.

In 2006 the airline sold 49% stake to Indigo Partners [they also have stakes in Spirit Airlines (USA), Wizz (Europe), Tiger (Singapore), and Abnanova Airlines (Russia)]. With the change, the airline replaced its aging fleet with new Airbus aircraft. The airline currently have 30 additional aircraft on order and hope to grow at a rate of 25% per year.

The airline’s logo is a golden eight-pointed mandala showing the eight characters of humanity and the eight elements of Javanese tradition. The five-petaled lotus in the center represents Indonesia’s state ideology, Pancasila.
