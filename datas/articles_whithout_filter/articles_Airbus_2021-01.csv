by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 39 and 89 commercial jets in December 2020, compared to 35 and 138 deliveries, respectively, in December 2019. For the full year 2020, Boeing delivered 157 aircraft, compared to 380 and 806 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, Airbus delivered 566 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the second year in a row. Due to COVID-19 fallout, deliveries were down from 863 and 800 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries crown for years to come due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

The past two years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but finally, things are looking brighter. On November 18, 2020, following a comprehensive and methodical safety review process that took 20 months to complete, the FAA ungrounded the 737 MAX. On December 9, Boeing delivered the first 737 MAX in almost two years, to United Airlines. On the same day, Brazilian airline GOL performed the first scheduled 737 MAX passenger flight since March 2019. However, the 737 MAX remains grounded in Europe, Australia, China, India, Japan, and Russia. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) expects to lift its grounding soon.

In December, Boeing delivered 39 jets, including 28 737s (27 MAX / 1 NG), one 747-8, six 767s, and four 777s. For the second month in a row, no 787 Dreamliners were delivered. Production of the 737 MAX was suspended from January 2020 until the end of May, when Boeing announced it had commenced low-rate production of the aircraft. Boeing expects the 737 MAX production rate to gradually increase to 31 per month by early 2022, with further increases as market demand allows. Prior to the 737 MAX production suspension, Boeing was manufacturing the jet at a reduced rate of 42 per month and had produced and shipped 387 jets.

Boeing has announced that the 787 production rate is being reduced from 14 per month (rate at the start of 2020) to just six per month during 2021. Boeing is in the process of moving all 787 final assembly to its facilities in Charleston, South Carolina. The move is expected to be completed by mid-2021. The combined 777/777X production rate will be reduced to two per month in 2021. Production rate assumptions have not changed for the 747 and 767 programs.

In December, Airbus delivered 89 jets, including six A220s, 67 A320s (66 NEO / 1 CEO), five A330s, eight A350s, and three A380s. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbus was targeting a 5 percent A320 rate increase to 63 jets per month from 2021 and was also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain that could have brought the production rate up to as high as 67 aircraft per month, or 804 per year, by 2023. This would have put the company within reach of a total of 1,000 jet deliveries per year. These plans have now been shelved. Due to COVID-19, Airbus has cut production on several programs and is looking to hold underlying jet output at 40 percent below pre-pandemic plans for two years.

The A320 production rate has been reduced to 40 aircraft per month, down from an average of over 53 aircraft per month in 2019. Recently, however, Airbus confirmed that the company is considering an increase to 47 A320neo jets per month in the second half of 2021. The A330 and A350 programs have been reduced to a rate of two and six aircraft per month, respectively. No rate cut was announced for the A220 or A380. With only five A380s in backlog as of December 31, 2020, the end of the A380 program draws near. The last aircraft is expected to be delivered to Emirates in May 2022.

Turning to the December orders race, Boeing had a strong month and booked three orders for a total of 90 jets; however, the company also reported 110 cancellations, of which 105 were for the 737 MAX. The December orders haul included a large order for 75 737 MAX 8-200s (a higher-capacity version of the 737-8) for Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline. Ryanair thereby increased its firm 737 order book to 210 aircraft but, at the same time, canceled an existing order for 48 737 MAX jets in a move to push back deliveries. Also in December, an undisclosed customer ordered seven 737 MAXs, while DHL – the major German international courier, package delivery and express mail service – placed an order for eight 777 freighters. In 2020, Boeing accumulated a total of 184 gross orders and received 655 cancellations, for a total of -471 net new orders. For the full year 2019, Boeing booked 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders).

In December, Airbus booked two new orders and reported 31 cancellations (one A220, four A320s, 11 A330s, and 15 A350s). December orders included an A330-800 for Air Greenland as well as an A330 MRTT tanker for the French armed forces. For the full year 2020, Airbus accumulated 383 gross orders and received 115 cancellations for a total of 268 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the second year in a row. For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768).

At the end of December, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,184 jets, of which 6,372, or 89 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 541 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of December 2020, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 4,997 aircraft, of which 4,031, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.3 years of shipments at the 2019 production level, or 12.7 years based on the 2020 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.3 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), 13.2 years based on 2019 production totals, and 31.8 years at the extremely low 2020 level, which the company should easily exceed in 2021. In 2020, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, was negative due to cancellations exceeding gross orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio was 0.47. In 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.89.

Why hydrogen is the most promising zero-emission technology - Airbus,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAxLXdoeS1oeWRyb2dlbi1pcy10aGUtbW9zdC1wcm9taXNpbmctemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is the clean energy carrier that is making the transport industry—from automotive and rail to shipping—sit up and take notice: hydrogen. For Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft Glenn Llewellyn, hydrogen is more than just an industry buzzword: it is potentially the future of aviation.

For over 50 years, kerosene has been king in the aviation industry, providing the essential fuel needed to power aircraft. But another high-potential technology pathway is now moving into the spotlight.

Hydrogen, the element at the very top of the periodic table, has been piquing the interest of aeronautical engineers worldwide. Glenn Llewellyn counts himself among hydrogen’s earliest fans. Today, he is at the helm of a hydrogen revolution at Airbus with the mission to unite all the ingredients needed to launch the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft programme.

At Airbus, we strongly believe renewable energy needs to power future aviation. And hydrogen is potentially the best pathway through which to do so.

Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft

Glenn LLewellyn, VP Zero Emissions Technology, Airbus

5 questions with Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft, Glenn Llewellyn

Q. As recently as a year ago, the aviation industry was abuzz about battery storage’s potential. What happened?

For the past ten years, Airbus has been investing in electric flight research and development. We’ve learned a lot and are proud to have put many electric aircraft into the air. The focus of our electric flight programme has been zero emissions, which we successfully achieved for our one- to four-seat aircraft demonstrators. We still believe electric and hybrid-electric flight has a lot to offer. However, larger aircraft require a very high energy-per-unit mass, and battery technology just hasn’t been advancing at the speeds we require to deliver a zero-emission aircraft according to the ambitious timeline we’ve set out. This is why we began opening up inquiry into other pathways, such as hydrogen.



Q. So it’s all about hydrogen. What makes it so attractive to Airbus?

There are a number of reasons. First, hydrogen doesn’t produce any CO2 emissions, if generated from renewable energy through electrolysis. This would essentially allow aviation to be powered by renewable energy. In addition, hydrogen may enable us to significantly reduce or even eliminate NOx and contrails. Second, as the energy sector continues its transition towards clean energy sources, we expect the cost of hydrogen to significantly decline over the next decade as its production ramps up at a large scale. This will make it increasingly cost-competitive with existing options, such as jet fuel. Finally, we won’t be satisfied with simply putting a hydrogen-powered aircraft into the air: we’re targeting wide-scale adoption and that starts with putting in place hydrogen infrastructure worldwide. We believe airports should already start using hydrogen to decarbonise their ground transportation ecosystem, thereby enabling hydrogen to scale up at airports in preparation for future hydrogen aircraft by the mid-2030s.

Q. Which hydrogen technologies is Airbus currently exploring for aircraft?

Hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines, and synthetic fuels are some of the technologies we’re exploring. The aircraft’s gas-turbine engine could also be hybrid in that it may be augmented by an electric motor. The aircraft could thus potentially be powered by hydrogen and a hybrid-electric system powered by fuel cells instead of batteries. These technologies are complementary, and the benefits are additive.

Q. What are some of the technical challenges of hydrogen aircraft?

There’s still the public misconception that hydrogen isn’t safe. What many people aren’t aware of are the extensive safety precautions that are considered in the design and operation of today’s kerosene-powered aircraft. Due to the rigorous application of these precautions, aviation has an impressive safety record. For this reason, industry safety targets will remain unchanged, but the technologies we use to achieve or exceed them will be different compared to the current generation of aircraft. It’s an area in which there will be zero compromises, so we’ll focus a lot of our attention on analysis, testing and flight demonstration. Storage is also an area in which technology development and maturation are required, because hydrogen tanks are bulkier and heavier than existing jet fuel storage tanks. This means we’ll need to come up with some innovative ways to integrate them into the aircraft.

Q. Will we find you talking about a new zero-emission technology that’s better than hydrogen one year from now?

Maybe! (laughs) Things move so quickly in aircraft innovation that it’s always challenging to say with 100% certainty. But hydrogen appears to be the most promising way to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact through both synthetic fuels and future hydrogen-powered aircraft. At Airbus, we strongly believe renewable energy needs to power future aviation. And hydrogen is potentially the best pathway through which to do so. We’re also giving ourselves five years to test before we make a final decision. And personally, I haven’t been this excited about a technology’s potential in years."

Opinion: Why The Airbus-Boeing Duopoly Is On The Edge - Aviation Week,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9vcGluaW9uLXdoeS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWR1b3BvbHktZWRnZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing-Airbus rivalry in commercial aerospace has become so engrained in popular culture that it would be easy to forget the duopoly truly started just two decades ago after Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas. Since then, the two companies have been fighting tooth and nail to launch new programs, win customer orders and ramp up their production rates, reaching their peak in 2018, when the two delivered 1,600 aircraft and generated $120 billion in revenues, with both the deliveries and revenues divided pretty evenly between them.

However, as the companies were celebrating their record deliveries, alarm bells started ringing. Two Boeing 737 MAX crashes within five months grounded the whole MAX fleet, and quality issues with the Boeing 787 also emerged. At the same time, Airbus announced it would stop producing its A380 jet, which cost more than $15 billion to develop, after selling just 250 units. Meanwhile, orders were drying up for its most recent widebody, the A350, with fewer than 100 new orders tallied in three years. Since then, of course, things have grown much worse, and both companies have been scrambling to mitigate COVID-19 crisis damage.

In the wake of such unprecedented shock, it is worth taking stock of where the Boeing-Airbus duopoly stands and what the future holds for both players.

At first glance, Boeing seems to be in a much worse situation than Airbus. As of November 2020, it had delivered only 118 aircraft for the year, while Airbus delivered 477, giving the European company an unprecedented 80% market share for yearly deliveries (see graph). Airbus’ orderbook is now almost 70% larger than Boeing’s. Additionally, Boeing has spent the last two years essentially firefighting, which means it has probably lost some ground in preparing for the next generation of airplanes. In the meantime, Airbus has been carrying on with the development of its A321XLR, which potentially pulls the rug from under Boeing’s work on addressing the “middle of the market” segment.

Nevertheless, one should not assess Airbus’ strengths simply based on Boeing’s current weaknesses. Airbus also has suffered from the crisis and in some respects still is structurally weaker than Boeing. First, its commercial aerospace business pretty much stands on its own (whereas Boeing can rely on a large and relatively stable defense and space business). Second, its industrial organization remains a multinational puzzle that is far from being optimized and still subject to political tensions between its home countries.

All things considered, though, Airbus has never been in a better position to take a significant lead over Boeing. Even if the balance of power lastingly tilts toward the European company, it should not fundamentally alter the duopoly dynamics in the medium term. The two players still will be dominant and compete head-to-head. Beyond the current decade, however, the big question is what the impact of China’s forthcoming entry will be.

Indeed, China’s first indigenously developed large commercial airplane—Comac’s narrowbody C919—is expected to come into service within a couple of years. This will mark the country’s official entry into the large commercial aircraft market and a major milestone of a long-term strategic play underpinning colossal geopolitical, industrial and commercial stakes. To succeed, it will need to rely on privileged access to a huge domestic market as well as an aggressive pricing strategy (the C919 could be priced 50% lower than the A320 or 737). But above all, selling commercial airplanes will become part of China’s “soft-power” strategy.

And while European or American airlines likely will not buy a Chinese airplane for some time, carriers in other regions may be enticed more easily. Of course, there are still many hurdles to be overcome for Comac to become a full-fledged competitor to Airbus and Boeing—not the least developing a robust supply chain and an international sales and service network. But in a world where trade wars could become increasingly the norm, China has a lot of assets to put forth.

Whereas the COVID-19 crisis has significantly dented Airbus’ and Boeing’s growth trajectories, it has boosted China’s quest to become an aerospace powerhouse. In the long term, China’s market entry is bound to alter the economics and the politics of the business, if only because it will force Boeing and Airbus to reconsider their global industrial strategy and take more risks on new product development.

Contrary to appearances, the Airbus-Boeing duopoly has never been a long, quiet river. It is certainly far from being one right now, and both players should brace for strong currents and treacherous rapids ahead."
"Airbus maturing autonomy, hybrid tech on 'Flightlab' test aircraft - Vertical Magazine","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLW1hdHVyaW5nLWF1dG9ub215LWh5YnJpZC10ZWNoLW9uLWZsaWdodGxhYi10ZXN0LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has revealed it is using a modified H130 to quickly mature platform-agnostic technology that could be used across the wider Airbus group’s fleet, including new flight controls, visual detection capabilities and hybrid propulsion.

Airbus has revealed the existence of its Flightlab “flying laboratory,” which is being used to test various new technologies. The aircraft is a modified Airbus H130. Airbus Photo

The manufacturer began tests using the Flightlab ­“flying laboratory” last April, and the first technology “bricks” matured using the helicopter could be available to consumers as early as mid-2021, according to Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters.

The Flightlab program is a collaborative effort, including engineers from Airbus Commercial and Airbus Defence and Space. The various technology bricks are matured separately on test benches before a core team of five or six engineers integrates them into the Flightlab aircraft.

“The integration . . . is the heart of the Flightlab,” Alexandre Gyerczynski, Flightlab project leader, told reporters during a conference call. “To install the systems which we want to test faster, at less cost, in an agile way.”

This approach will bring some of these technologies to market two or three times faster than conventional development methods, added Krysinski.

The first to hit the market will be a rotor strike alerting system (RSAS), which uses two lidar sensors – one on either side of the aircraft – to detect obstacles near to the main or tail rotor, much like a parking sensor on a car. And, in a similar vein, this information is presented to the pilot on a cockpit display that illustrates where the obstacle is located, with its proximity shown by a green, orange, or red light in the display.

“This system will be able to work in the rain, dust and snow conditions, which are more difficult situations for the pilot,” said Gyerczynski.

Airbus began testing the RSAS in December 2020, and expects to bring it to the market in the middle of this year. “It will start from the smallest platform,” said Krysinski, indicating the ubiquitous H125/AS350.

The RSAS system is just one of several technologies the manufacturer is developing and/or maturing on the Flightlab aircraft that aim to enhance autonomy and safety. The others include an image detection system known as EAGLE (eye for autonomous guidance and landing extension), an enhanced health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), and urban air mobility flight controls.

The EAGLE system utilizes a gyro-stabilized camera to analyze an aircraft’s environment, and interprets this using algorithms “to detect areas which are interesting or dangerous for the aircraft,” said Gyerczynski. “In the future, [the aircraft] will use this algorithm together with the automatic pilot.”

Airbus autonomy expert Nicolas Damiani said the long-term goal for the EAGLE system is full autonomy, but that the manufacturer would employ a “step-by-step” approach to reaching it, with the level of automation progressively increased.

The manufacturer demonstrated the ability to acquire a helipad using a camera, and automate the approach and landing, at the end of 2019.

“Here, the intention is to not only do that with the camera, not only to do that for the approach and landing, but to cover, step by step, all the flight phases,” said Damiani.

The idea is to let the pilot decide how much of the flight is automated, leaving them free to monitor systems and make “high level” decisions.

In terms of the flight controls, Damiani described them as employing a “hybrid architecture,” rather than being full fly-by-wire, allowing them to work with the H130’s conventional hydraulically actuated systems. Nonetheless, they are considered a “new approach to pilot/machine interface,” developed with the stated aim of reducing the pilot workload and increasing safety.

And while Airbus (and other third-party providers) already have HUMS systems available for their aircraft, the version in Flightlab will be lighter, more effective – and more intelligent, said Gyerczynski. The software will be capable of “pre-analyzing” the data it collects before sending it out and provide operators the ability to balance their main and tail rotors directly on the aircraft, without the need for an external system.

Hybrid propulsion

The second key area of focus for the Flightlab program is the pursuit of hybrid and electric propulsion technologies. To begin with, a 100-kW electric motor will be connected to the main gearbox to provide emergency electric power in the event of an engine failure.

“When the turbine [engine] fails, the system will be switched on automatically,” said Luca Cossetti, an electrification and hybridisation expert. “The pilot will know that he has a reserve of energy, or power, for about 30 seconds, roughly. Ideally, the power is provided at the failure, so to avoid the rotor speed decaying too much, and at the flare, where the pilot will stop the helicopter and pull on the collective to push on landing the helicopter. In that case . . . the power needs to be available for five/10 seconds to really allow the flare.”

The electric motor would also improve the aircraft’s maximum takeoff weight, Cossetti said.

The target of increasing efficiency and reducing fuel consumption would be achieved in a second step, he said. A more powerful version of the electric system would be customized to provide additional power in some phases of the flight, much like a hybrid electric engine in a car.

“That evolution will bring some emission reduction, and also noise reduction, which is a significant part of the environmental reduction we want to achieve,” said Cossetti.

Flightlab began tests to measure and correlate the sound levels of helicopters as perceived by people on the ground last year, using noise sensors installed around Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France.

“This measurement is . . . helping our acoustic experts to develop models of how the noise is amplified or reduced due to the buildings’ and the streets’ configuration,” said Gyerczynski.

The models will be used to help guide further refinement on helicopters to reduce noise generation, as well as to guide aviation authorities as they consider regulations related to urban air mobility.

The H130 was selected as the Flightlab platform due to its small size, said Gyerczynski. As well as reducing the cost of flight tests, a small platform “forces the designers to design light and at best cost,” he said.

Krysinski said the arrival of the type of technologies incorporated in Flightlab was part of a “third revolution” in aviation, allowing helicopters to become lighter, reduce consumption, and make them quieter.

“All these converging technologies we’ll bring on the market in this decade are really very interesting disruptive concepts, and will really bring value to the customers,” he said.

Airbus plans to continue flight tests using Flightlab into 2024."

"Airbus, Thales win second-generation Galileo satellite contracts - SpaceNews","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdGhhbGVzLXdpbi1zZWNvbmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1nYWxpbGVvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb250cmFjdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The European Commission announced Jan. 20 it will award contracts to Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space to build an initial set of next-generation Galileo navigation satellites, shutting out incumbent manufacturer OHB.

Airbus and Thales will each build six of the second-generation Galileo satellites under contracts that will be formally signed at the end of January. The combined value of the contracts is 1.47 billion euros ($1.78 billion), but the Commission did not disclose the value of each company’s contracts.

The 12 satellites will be the start of the second generation of the Galileo system that will feature improved accuracy and resilience. The first satellites will be ready for launch in 2024.

Galileo is one of the cornerstones of the European Union’s space activities and, combined with the Copernicus program of Earth observation satellites, account for nearly all the EU’s space budget. However, EU officials said both programs need to improve to keep pace with changing demands and growing capabilities outside Europe.

“Galileo and Copernicus must evolve. Otherwise, they will fast become obsolete,” warned Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the European Commission, in a speech Jan. 12 at the 13th European Space Conference. New technologies that will be incorporated into the next generation of Galileo satellites, he said, include digitally reconfigurable antennas, intersatellite links, more advanced atomic clocks and all-electric propulsion.

“The second generation of Galileo will have significantly improved service capabilities, notably in the field of secure navigation and resilience against emerging threats,” Breton said. At a press briefing later in the conference he declined to go into more details about the program, citing the pending contract award.

The contracts with Airbus and Thales shut out OHB Group, the prime contractor for the current generation of Galileo satellites. The European Commission said in its announcement that the European Space Agency, which partners with the EU on Galileo, performed a two-month technical and financial evaluation and recommended the awards to Airbus and Thales.

The statement noted there were three bidders, but did not disclose the third bidder. However, in a Jan. 20 announcement, OHB acknowledged that it had submitted a proposal and had been informed by ESA that it was not successful. That decision, it added, did not affect its ongoing contract to provide 34 Galileo satellites, 22 of which have already been delivered with the remaining 12 in various stages of production.

OHB partnered with Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) for the current Galileo satellite contract, with SSTL providing the navigation payload. Such a partnership would not have been possible for the next-generation Galileo satellites since the United Kingdom, where SSTL is based, has left the EU and can no longer participate in the Galileo program.

At a Jan. 14 press briefing, Paul Verhoef, director of navigation at ESA, said SSTL delivered the final navigation payloads for the current generation of Galileo satellites in November. “It is, of course, unfortunate that the UK is now excluded from the navigation programs of the EU,” he said.

“We don’t expect to see UK participation on those programs,” he added, other that possibly components not available elsewhere. “This is what it is. This is the political reality of the day.”"
First look inside JetBlue's swanky new Airbus A220 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2pldGJsdWUtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue is starting the new year with a treat for domestic flyers — welcoming the first of 70 Airbus A220s to the fleet.

Set to replace the aging Embraer 190s, these fuel-efficient, flyer-friendly aircraft are slated to become the future of JetBlue's domestic backbone along with the existing fleet of over 200 Airbus A320s and A321s.

On Tuesday, JetBlue unveiled the plane's interior for the first time. Long story short, there's lots to love, but let's take a look inside to see why.

Spacious 2-3 configuration

The Airbus A220 (formerly known as the Bombardier C-Series) quickly became a fan-favorite for its spacious 2-3 seating configuration.

JetBlue's Airbus A220-300 is outfitted in an all-coach configuration with 140 seats spread across 28 rows.

The 2-3 arrangement affords flyers with a better shot at avoiding the dreaded middle seat compared to a traditional 3-3 configuration on the Airbus A320 or A321. For JetBlue, however, the A220 is replacing the Embraer 190, which sports a 2-2 configuration without any middle seats.

Those who end up sitting in the middle on the A220 will likely miss the E190. Everyone else has a lot to look forward to.

As for its new Airbus A321neo, JetBlue chose the Collins Meridian seat for the ""bones"" of the seat, but customized the rest of the experience.

The seats themselves are quite comfortable, especially for shorter segments, like the plane's inaugural route from Boston (BOS) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) in mid-June. JetBlue has teased that the A220 could fly on some coast-to-coast hops, but it remains to be seen which routes it might fly.

The 28 rows are split with 30 Even More Space seats and the remaining 110 as standard Core seats. Roughly 27% of the A220's seats are dedicated to extra-legroom seating, a roughly 10% boost compared to the soon-to-be-retired Embraer 190.

Even More Space seats span the first four rows of the aircraft, as well as the exit row 12 and row 13. Seat pitch is 35 inches, and all extra-legroom seats recline, even those in the exit row.

Coach is outfitted with an industry-leading 32 inches of pitch. Just be sure not to select the last row since it doesn't recline.

At 18.6 inches wide, the A220 sports the widest seat across all of JetBlue's economy cabins — and it was noticeable. I had plenty of room to wiggle around when sitting.

One of the most noticeable innovations in the passenger experience on the A220, according to Mariya Stoyanova, director of product development, is the added seatback cushioning and headrest padding made from a new, softer vegan leather material, dubbed Ultraleather. I, unfortunately, couldn't put it to the test during my 30-minute tour, but I'll have a deeper look after the plane's inaugural flight.

Top-notch onboard entertainment and amenities

JetBlue has long offered one of the best onboard experiences in the domestic skies, and the A220 is poised to become the most advanced, tech-forward jet in the airline's fleet.

Each seat is outfitted with a 10.1-inch touchscreen seatback monitor, perfect for watching live DirecTV or on-demand content from HBO, Showtime and more.

Aside from the content itself, the screen's 1080p resolution is easily the sharpest in the fleet.

Some of the other nifty inflight entertainment features include support for picture-in-picture, a new 3D flight map and the ability to pair the screen to a phone to use as a remote or game controller.

Each seat supports near-field communication (NFC), which can enable contactless payments for in-seat purchases. JetBlue won't be activating the readers just yet, according to Stoyanova, who told TPG that the carrier hasn't finalized plans for using the NFC readers.

In addition to the personal entertainment monitors, every JetBlue flight offers free gate-to-gate Wi-Fi, including those operated by the A220.

The carrier opted to install the faster ViaSat 2 satellite receivers onboard, which boosts internet coverage, speed and reliability compared to the older JetBlue planes.

As for the seat's amenities, the tray table measures 16.5 inches wide and 8.5 inches long — roughly industry standard for the A220.

JetBlue added its customized seat-back storage holders to the A220, which feature three individual mesh pockets, each capable of holding a water bottle and other loose items.

Finally, each row is equipped with shared power outlets. There's one outlet for every two seats on the port side and two outlets for every three seats on the starboard side.

In addition to a universal power outlet, there's also a USB-C port at each outlet, perfect for charging the latest devices like the iPhone 12 Pro.

Though outlets are shared, each monitor has a standard USB-A port to power older handheld devices.

No-window bathrooms, thoughtful cabin design

Let's start with the bad news for aviation enthusiasts. JetBlue didn't install windows in the A220 lavatories.

There are three bathrooms on JetBlue's A220, one larger one at the front, and two significantly tighter ones at the rear of the aircraft.

None feature windows like you'll find on Delta's A220s, but they do sport a subway-tile mosaic in a nod to the carrier's New York roots.

Speaking of windows, one of the many reasons flyers love the A220 is its large windows. In JetBlue's configuration, only rows 12 and 13 have misaligned windows. The rest are ready for the perfect Wing View Wednesday shot.

Another popular A220 feature is the large overhead bins, which should help reduce the number of gate-checked carry-on bags.

I'd avoid sitting at the bulkhead due to the restricted legroom. However, if you end up in row 1 and you can read Morse code, you'll have plenty of time to decipher the hidden message emblazoned over the bulkheads. (Spoiler alert: it spells out JetBlue.)

Though the plane is a big improvement for passengers, the cabin crew might not be as excited. Both the forward and rear galleys are noticeably smaller and tighter than on the larger Airbus A320 and A321.

The A220 is just the beginning

The A220 is the latest chapter in JetBlue's fleet modernization strategy. The New York-based carrier plans to take delivery of seven new planes by year's end, representing just 10% of its entire A220 order book.

Except for the added middle seat, the aircraft is a notable improvement compared to the Embraer 190 it replaces. With wider seats, oversized windows, larger overhead bins and a slew of tech updates, JetBlue's A220 is sure to impress flyers.

But JetBlue isn't stopping there; 2021 is set to be a massive year for the airline.

After the A220 inaugural, all eyes turn across the pond to London, where JetBlue plans to land for the first time later this year. To make the transatlantic journey, the carrier will take delivery of brand-new Airbus A321LRs, featuring a redesigned Mint business-class cabin.

For now, though, some lucky domestic flyers will have a brand-new jet waiting for them.

Airbus unveils its helicopter Flightlab to test tomorrow's technologies - Airbus,"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMS1haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1pdHMtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mbGlnaHRsYWItdG8tdGVzdC10b21vcnJvd3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 22 January 2021 – Airbus Helicopters has started in-flight tests on board its Flightlab, a platform-agnostic flying laboratory exclusively dedicated to maturing new technologies. Airbus Helicopters’ Flightlab provides an agile and efficient test bed to quickly test technologies that could later equip Airbus’ current helicopter range, and even more disruptive ones for future fixed-wing aircraft or (e)VTOL platforms.

Airbus Helicopters intends to pursue the testing of hybrid and electric propulsion technologies with its Flightlab demonstrator, as well as exploring autonomy, and other technologies aimed at reducing helicopter sound levels or improving maintenance and flight safety.

“Investing in the future remains essential, even in times of crisis, especially when those innovations bring added value to our customers by targeting increased safety, reduced pilot workload, and reduced sound levels,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “Having a dedicated platform to test these new technologies brings the future of flight a step closer and is a clear reflection of our priorities at Airbus Helicopters,” he added.

Flight tests started last April when the demonstrator was used to measure helicopter sound levels in urban areas and to particularly study how buildings may affect people’s perception. First results show that buildings play an important role in masking or amplifying sound levels and these studies will be instrumental when the time comes for sound modelling and regulation setting, especially for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) initiatives. Testing was pursued in December to evaluate the Rotor Strike Alerting System (RSAS) aimed at alerting crews about the imminent risk of collision with the main and tail rotors.

Tests this year will include an image-detection solution with cameras to enable low altitude navigation, the viability of a dedicated Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) for light helicopters, and an Engine Back-up System, which will provide emergency electric power in the event of a turbine failure. Testing on the Flightlab will continue in 2022 in order to evaluate a new ergonomic design of intuitive pilot flight controls intended to further reduce pilot workload, which could be applicable to traditional helicopters as well as other VTOL formulas such as UAM.

The Flightlab is an Airbus-wide initiative, which reflects the company’s approach to innovation focused on delivering value to customers. Airbus already has several well-known Flightlabs such as the A340 MSN1, used to assess the feasibility of introducing laminar flow wing technology on a large airliner, and the A350 Airspace Explorer used to evaluate connected cabin technologies inflight.

Will Airbus And Boeing Adjust Aircraft Pricing To Stimulate Demand? - Aviation Week,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vd2lsbC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWFkanVzdC1haXJjcmFmdC1wcmljaW5nLXN0aW11bGF0ZS1kZW1hbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

How do you think Airbus and Boeing will adjust aircraft pricing to stimulate delivery demand from airlines?

Jens Flottau, Aviation Week’s executive editor for Commercial Aviation, responds:

The answer is complicated. In theory, relatively high levels of production in times of low or zero demand lead to low pricing. But the reality might prove more nuanced and differ by program and manufacturer.

Broadly speaking, the most pressing issue is not getting new orders to fill production slots (even though that would be nice for Airbus and Boeing) but rather securing orders placed a long time ago that are now coming up for delivery. For these orders, prices are contractually fixed. When deliveries are deferred, typically escalation clauses apply, so some aircraft could actually become more expensive. On the other hand, Boeing has to compensate customers for its 737 MAX delivery delays. For the backlog, the question is more about financing than pricing.

Nonetheless, a longer-term risk is inherent in this strategy. As manufacturers force unwanted capacity into the market, aircraft values and pricing leverage for future new orders will decline. Instead of ordering new aircraft, airlines could opt for amply available cheap-but-still-young secondhand aircraft that other carriers or lessors want to dispose of.

It is impossible to predict how serious that risk is. Important factors that will determine the outcome are the speed of recovery and the number of aircraft that are permanently retired. Industry optimists believe that demand could rebound sharply once novel coronavirus vaccines are broadly available.

But a lot of young aircraft still in long-term storage could be reactivated by their current or new operators. With fuel prices still relatively low, it could be financially attractive to enter into short-term leases for these aircraft and delay the capital expenditure for new equipment.

Some program-specific aspects are also worth considering. Boeing will want to show that market confidence is returning for the MAX, and the best way to do so is by announcing new orders, such as the one Ryanair placed. The low-cost carrier surely did not pay anywhere near list prices for the aircraft.

Airbus does not have that type of issue with the A320neo family. Yet its A330neo program is in trouble, with a weak backlog that could shrink even more. The A330neo already limits Boeing’s pricing power on the competing 787. Some further concessions are possible to keep A330neo production going at reasonable levels.

Weak widebody pricing, in general, may continue to be a broader issue for years. Demand had been low for some time even before the COVID-19 crisis partly because of over-ordering during the boom in the early 2010s. Another factor is that airlines have begun to realize that some of the models on offer are simply too big—such as the 777X and the A350-1000, not to mention the 747-8 and the A380.

International air travel disappeared practically overnight because of COVID-19 and is expected to be slowest to return after the pandemic subsides. As the industry flies out of the crisis, airlines could opt to use more long-haul narrowbodies where feasible to cut back on investment and recurring costs, further dampening demand for widebodies. On the other hand, both manufacturers have made deep cuts to production levels already, and that could bolster what is left of their pricing power."

Single-aisle rates gradually increasing

No change to widebody production

Toulouse, 21 January 2021 – Airbus SE (Stock exchange symbol: AIR) is updating its production rate planning for its A320 Family aircraft in response to the market environment.

The new average production rates for the A320 Family will now lead to a gradual increase in production from the current rate of 40 per month to 43 in Q3 and 45 in Q4 2021. This latest production plan represents a slower ramp up than the previously anticipated 47 aircraft per month from July.

The A220 monthly production rate will increase from four to five aircraft per month from the end of Q1 2021 as previously foreseen.

Widebody production is expected to remain stable at current levels, with monthly production rates of around five and two for the A350 and A330, respectively. This decision postpones a potential rate increase for the A350 to a later stage.

Airbus continues to monitor the market closely. With these revised rates, Airbus preserves its ability to meet customer demand while protecting its ability to further adapt as the global market evolves. Airbus expects the commercial aircraft market to return to pre-COVID levels by 2023 to 2025."

Additionally, the company delivered 300 rotorcraft worldwide despite the pandemic travel restrictions, resulting in a stable 48% share of the civil and parapublic market and thus allowing Airbus Helicopters to maintain its market-leading position thanks to its wide range of competitive products designed to enable customers to perform a multitude of missions.

“I am proud of our teams all over the world who adapted their ways of working to be there for our customers when they needed us the most, striving to help them to maintain their essential missions across the globe by delivering helicopters and the associated support and services they required. I would like to thank our customers for their continued trust in Airbus Helicopters,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “We certified the five-bladed H145 and the H160 and laid solid foundations for our pursuit of zero-emission technologies with our CityAirbus demonstrator,” he added.

Key deliveries in 2020 included the first five-bladed H145 to launch customer Norsk Luftambulanse, a helicopter emergency medical services operator, at the end of September, followed by deliveries to DRF Luftrettung at the end of the year. On the heavy side, the first H225Ms were handed over to the Kuwait Air Force as well as the first NH90s for the Spanish Air Force. September also saw the 463rd delivery, on time, on cost, and on quality, of an UH-72A Lakota from the Airbus Helicopters factory in Columbus, Mississippi.

Order highlights for 2020 consist of 84 helicopters for the best-selling H145, including 17 UH-72B for the US Army, the first Fenestron and Helionix-equipped versions to be ordered.

The H135 achieved solid sales with 33 units and also received the EASA certification of an alternate gross weight as well as a new single pilot IFR cockpit layout at the end of 2020. Milestone Aviation and Heli-Union both became new customers for the multi-mission H160, ordered to address a wide range of missions including offshore transportation.

The NH90 had a successful 2020 with the Bundeswehr placing an order for 31 naval helicopters to replace the ageing Sea Lynx fleet due to be retired. The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) confirmed the development of a new Standard 2 version to equip the French Special Forces and the first NH90 for Qatar performed its maiden flight at the end of the year.

On the customer support and service side, once again there was a strong showing for HCare support contracts, with new customers joining the ranks such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Air Methods Corporation. Facing the global pandemic, the company mobilised to keep its military and civil customers flying thanks to elevated levels of technical and logistics support, new distance learning solutions, and direct assistance from Airbus Helicopters in making protective equipment available to pilots and crews. A new AirbusWorld collaborative customer platform was launched based on feedback from customers, offering a streamlined user experience and new functionalities aimed at fostering open dialogue among operators and with the company.

Airbus Helicopters’ resilient business model allows the company to continue investing and preparing the future. In 2020, innovation milestones included the first fully automatic flight of CityAirbus, a demonstrator that will play an important role in developing zero-emission flight and in preparing the future urban air mobility market. The VSR700, the company’s rotary-wing unmanned aerial system, performed its first free flight in July and autonomous deck-landing trials at the end of the year.

The pandemic-stricken year was a little too rough to deal with for both companies, as they witnessed a series of order cancellations, delivery delays, record low production rates and furloughs, since March 2020.

Pandemic’s Impact on Boeing and Airbus

The pandemic struck at the worst possible time for Boeing, as we know it was already facing intense scrutiny from regulators and customers worldwide due to the grounding of 737 MAX since March 2019. Its prolonged impacts coupled with air travel restrictions, courtesy of COVID-19, completely rattled Boeing’s revival plans for 737, resulting in adjustments in the production rates for all of its commercial aircraft programs, with a furloughed workforce.



Airbus, despite overtaking Boeing during the year, is also facing its gravest crisis to date. The aircraft giant has been forced to reduce its global workforce and resize its commercial aircraft activity in response to the COVID-19 situation.

A Sneak Peek Into the Dismal 2020 Numbers

Boeing ended 2020 with 4,223 jets in its backlog, declining 22% year over year. Evidently, due to the pandemic's impact and other existing issues with the 737 line of jets, the deliveries made throughout the year took a serious hit as well. In the whole of 2020, Boeing could only manage to deliver a total of 157 commercial aircraft compared with 380 aircraft delivered at the end of 2019. Interestingly, per a Flight Global report, Boeing’s net orders took a nasty tumble, as the company lost 1,026 orders during the year.



Meanwhile, Airbus was also a victim of the global turmoil, as its total jet deliveries in 2020 slumped 34.4% year over year to 566 units. Its backlog totaled 7,184 jets at the end of the year, falling 4% from the 2019 numbers. Net orders placed for jets in 2020 were also substantially down to 268 compared with net orders of 768 jets placed during the previous year.

Story continues

Airbus Overtakes Boeing in the Race for Supremacy

Despite facing a handful of pandemic-related challenges, Airbus managed to seize the title of the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, with its arch-rival Boeing registering a notable downfall. In particular, Boeing faced extreme scrutiny for its bestselling 737 MAX aircraft, almost throughout 2019 and 2020, as these jets were grounded by airliners across the world for a period of almost 20 months. Boeing's misfortune turned out to be largely beneficial for Airbus, as the latter ramped up production for its renowned A320 family of jets. Resultantly, in 2020, Airbus saw a higher market share globally for the very first time.

How Prospective Does 2021 Look?

After a disastrous 2020, 2021 is expected to be a lot better in terms of air travel, led by fewer restrictions on flying, re-opening of borders and the widespread availability of vaccines. This would enable airliners to fly more frequently and generate better revenues. In line with such projections, passenger numbers are expected to grow to 2.8 billion in 2021, a billion more than 2020, per an IATA report.



Therefore, we expect Airbus and Boeing, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, along with other commercial aircraft manufacturers, such as Textron TXT and Embraer S.A. ERJ, to post better delivery figures in 2021 and effectively revamp operations.

Airbus presents ZEROe fuel cell concept - www.electrive.com,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wNC9haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtemVyb2UtZnVlbC1jZWxsLWNvbmNlcHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled a new configuration as part of its ZEROe programme that could enable passenger aircraft to fly further than ever before with zero emissions. The so-called ‘pod configuration’ consists of six detachable fuel cell propeller propulsion systems mounted under the wings.

In September, Airbus had given details of new hydrogen-powered aircraft studies. The aircraft manufacturer unveiled three concepts for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035. All of these concepts, code-named ZEROe, rely on hydrogen as the main energy source, but each takes a different approach.

Now Airbus is providing an update on its future programme, showing a new ‘pod’ configuration and saying it is currently conducting studies to assess how scalable such an approach would be for large commercial aircraft. “The ‘pod’ configuration is essentially a distributed fuel cell propulsion system that delivers thrust to the aircraft via six propulsors arranged along the wing,” expresses Matthieu Thomas, chief aircraft architect for the ZEROe programme. “Hydrogen fuel cells have very different design considerations, so we knew we had to come up with a unique approach.”

Each pod is essentially a self-contained propulsion system equipped with an eight-bladed propeller, electric motors, a fuel cell, power electronics, a tank for liquid hydrogen, a cooling system and a suite of assistance devices. “Hydrogen and air are supplied to the fuel cells to generate electric current. Power electronics convert the current to power the electric motors. Thanks to this energy, the motor shaft rotates, thereby turning the propeller,” Airbus said in an accompanying release.

The pods, in turn, can be removed, which the developer calls a “striking feature.” They could be disassembled and reassembled in record time, he said. This, he said, provides a practical and quick solution for maintenance and possibly hydrogen refueling at airports.

Airbus says it has applied for a patent for the ‘pod’ configuration, but at the same time warns against expecting too much: “A lot of work still needs to be done to determine whether this configuration could be a suitable solution. For now, it remains one of many exciting technology options Airbus engineers are considering.” Airbus plans to make a decision on which concept will be brought to market in 2025.

Beyond seats: getting the new longhaul narrowbody cabins right - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvYmV5b25kLXNlYXRzLWdldHRpbmctdGhlLW5ldy1sb25naGF1bC1uYXJyb3dib2R5LWNhYmlucy1yaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Longhaul narrowbody aircraft like the Airbus A321neo’s LR and XLR variants are going to be key to the COVID-19 recovery — and to future route network success — for many airlines. But passengers, by and large, remain unconvinced: they hear “ten hours on an A321” and think it’ll be like easyJet, AirAsia, Spirit or Jetstar. Some of this is a matter of setting expectations, being clear about what’s on offer and making brand promises around seats and direct inflight comfort. But some of it is beyond seats too, into the rest of the cabin.

Let’s start off with the situation that seems to give most people qualms: the lavatories. Without the cross-fuselage spaces between emergency exit doors to install mid-cabin lavatories, few narrowbodies have anything beyond one up front (often reserved for a premium cabin if there is one) and two down the back, which are increasingly the mini-lavs that are practically unusable for a growing number of passengers. In a year where washing our hands has proven more important than ever, that must surely change.

Airbus has looked to solve this problem with its Space-Flex convertible PRM lavatory offering, and Diehl/Lufthansa Technik have offered something similar for the retrofit market. But a larger footprint would ensure a far more accessible experience for PRMs.

Moving not too far away from the lavatories (itself something of a problem) we come to the galleys.

Down the back, there’s a question about just how effectively 150-200 people can be catered to from an amount of galley space that was originally designed for shorthaul options that were, essentially, “tea or coffee?” — will we see a return to the time where carts are stored below the cabin floor and elevatored up? Is there an overhead option, like Airbus, HAECO, Lufthansa Technik and others are offering with ceiling stowage for some items?

In economy, it feels likely that airlines will need to streamline their offerings for the longhaul narrowbody era, probably along the lines of Qantas’ “no-tray” concept that débuted in 2014, with second snack options being the kind of sandwich or more filling hot wrap that has become increasingly popular in recent years.

Up front is where the complications arise, because airlines are increasingly setting high expectations for business class food, and that requires galley space, and indeed some specialist equipment like espresso machines.

Streamlining of menus and soft product here is perhaps inevitable as well, although in some cases — like Qantas’ lightweight 787-generation tableware — this work has already begun in other contexts.

Throughout the aircraft, can this be made to feel more premium, with a “book the cook” style service allowing for more choice (and even ancillary revenue) but less storage space, and less food waste to boot?

Fundamentally, though, the tension between the galley as a functional space and a desire for the doors 1 entrance to be attractive and accessible has yet to be solved on any narrowbody, even with the forthcoming Airbus A320 Airspace cabin.

A sweeping, open grand entrance can be impressive, but what about ensuring a functional space? What role can convertible bars like Collins’ M-Flex play?

How can the wall space at the flight attendant seats be used: some sort of attachable work surface, perhaps? How can the aesthetic appeal of the space be improved beyond metallic galley insert Jenga chic? Is there room for a self-service space like China Airlines’ excellent example?

Space is of course a wider question, with passengers’ concerns about the overhead bin space supposed to be assuaged by Airspace, but questions on these highly optimised floorplans remaining.

New business seats like the JPA/Williams AirTek monocoque do come with more storage, but there are questions there too. Will airlines need to put into place policy changes for carryon baggage: none for passengers on the cheapest basic economy fares? Will there need to be some expansion of gateside valet services, linked perhaps to a premium ground experience: pop passengers and their luggage into waiting vehicles for a fast track to arrivals?

And what other interiors developments might be needed? As we look into 2021 and beyond, this is the perfect time to get those #PaxEx thinking caps going.

Airbus delivered 566 aircraft in 2020, maintaining its crown as the world's largest planemaker for a second year as U.S. rival Boeing remained mired for most of that period in the grounding of its 737 MAX, company data showed on Friday.

Deliveries from the European planemaker fell 34% from a record 863 in 2019 as the coronavirus crisis hit air travel demand.

The announcement confirms a Reuters report on Tuesday that Airbus had delivered more than 560 aircraft in 2020, beating an internal target.

Airbus sold a net total of 268 aircraft after adjusting for cancellations, down from 768 in 2019.

Boeing delivered 118 jets between January and November and had a negative total of 454 net orders before accounting adjustments, giving Airbus an unassailable lead for the year. MAX deliveries resumed in December.

Cancellations for Airbus jets included 10 A350 wide-body jets on order from troubled Malaysian carrier AirAsia X.

In total Airbus lost orders for 26 wide-body jets, reflecting a continued severe slowdown in intercontinental travel - expected to be the slowest travel industry segment to recover from the pandemic.

Airbus is planning a summit meeting with major suppliers in the coming days, amid mounting speculation that it may have to delay planned jet output increases as Europe faces a resurgent coronavirus crisis, industry sources said."
Airbus Helicopters reports 20% drop in bookings in 2020 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJlcG9ydHMtMjAtZHJvcC1pbi1ib29raW5ncy1pbi0yMDIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters received just four orders for the H225 Super Puma and none at all for its super medium H175 in 2020, but still claimed an increased share of a global civil helicopter order book that was significantly reduced by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The OEM’s annual total of 289 orders was a 20 percent drop from 2019, but it expects its share of the global civil market orderbook to be “close to 70 percent” in terms of units, according to Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even.

Discussing the company’s newly-released annual results with media, Even described 2020 as “a year of resilience and a year of contrast” for the manufacturer, with the results being “in line with what we anticipated in March/April at the beginning of the [Covid-19] crisis.”

The company will likely feel the impact from the drop in bookings in 2022, he added. “[In 2021], [we] will still be supported by the bookings we secured in the previous year,” he said. “We anticipate the beginning of the impact in 2022, and in particular in [Airbus’s production facility in] Marignane, which would start to suffer from the lower level of bookings for the Super Pumas.”

Describing production work in Marignane as “strongly supported by the level of deliveries for the Super Puma,” Even said an order for eight H225M Caracals for the French armed forces — part of the French government’s €15 billion support plan for its aviation industry — is “so important” for the facility. The order is expected to be placed “at the beginning” of 2021.

The four bookings Airbus did receive for the Super Puma in 2020 were all recorded in Japan. Even said other potential customers are postponing their decisions to renew their fleets.

As for the lack of bookings for the H175, Even pointed to the continued downturn in the oil-and-gas market. “Nevertheless, I’m optimistic when it comes to the future of this program,” he said. The type passed 40,000 flight hours with fleet leader NHV in 2020, and Airbus is continuing to work on a de-icing capability for it, due in 2023.

However, despite the low level of bookings for its larger types, Even said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is being most felt within the light helicopter lines. The OEM took 124 bookings for these aircraft (102 H125s and 22 H130s), which he said was a direct result of the low level of activity in segments such as tourism and VIP.

The downturn in the light line is similar to that seen following the 2008/09 financial crisis, and the company’s experience there provides cause for optimism, he said. “It’s a segment that could recover quickly,” he said.

Investment in innovation

On the positive side, Even said the increased market share was a result of Airbus’s “investment in innovation” in the form of the new H160 medium, the five-bladed version of the H145, the H135’s increased gross weight, and an upcoming increase in power in the H125.

“Continuously we invest in our products, or launch new products to ensure that at any time we have the right products answering to our customers’ requirements,” he said.

In terms of bookings on these other lines, Airbus received orders for 33 H135s, 84 H145s, and 11 H160s. The remainder of the bookings included two Dauphin family, and 31 NH90s.

Even said he was “not at all disappointed” with the level of activity on the new medium H160, and was particularly pleased to have now secured customers from within each of the sectors it was targeting with the type (VIP, EMS, oil-and-gas, military, and homeland security). The OEM is still expecting certification of the type by the Federal Aviation Administration by the end of the first quarter of this year.

The 300 aircraft Airbus delivered in 2020 was also down from 2019, but only by 10 percent.

“We have seen a low level of [order] cancellation,” said Even. “I think it’s also a sign of trust and a strong message from our customers, despite the difficult context for all the orders placed before the crisis. . . . They continue to need these helicopters; they have continued to fly.”

With the pandemic still causing high case numbers in many places around the world, Even said Airbus’s short-term priority will remain the protection of its employees, as well as ensuring it continues its activities and supporting its customers.

“We don’t expect a recovery in the short term — two or three years — but we are confident about the perspective in the mid-term,” he said. “We will keep our level of R&D investment, despite the [challenging] context.”"
Intelsat orders two satellites from Airbus - SpaceNews,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbnRlbHNhdC1vcmRlcnMtdHdvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtZnJvbS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Intelsat has ordered two geostationary communications satellites from Airbus Defence and Space that will support the satellite operator’s aviation connectivity business.

The companies announced Jan. 8 the order of two spacecraft from Airbus’ OneSat family of fully reconfigurable geostationary satellites. The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal beyond starting the satellites will be delivered in 2023.

Intelsat did not state where the two satellites will be located in GEO or even what spectrum it will use, other than they will operate in “multiple frequency bands.” The company said the satellites will be part of its effort to develop a new network that both offers more capacity and can be reconfigured to meet changing market demands.

“Intelsat’s next-generation software-defined network will be the catalyst for our growth, enabling future Gogo Commercial Aviation inflight broadband services, as well as other managed services across Intelsat’s customer segments,” Stephen Spengler, chief executive of Intelsat, in a statement about the satellite order. Intelsat acquired Gogo Commercial Aviation in September for $400 million.

In a Dec. 31 filing in a federal bankruptcy court overseeing Intelsat’s Chapter 11 case, Intelsat sought court permission to order the satellites. The two satellites, called “SD Satellites” in the filing, will be used to serve the continental United States, the North Atlantic region, and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere, the company said. The satellites were part of “a broader capital expenditure plan within the Debtors’ go-forward business plan” shared with creditors in October.

“This expected customer demand is particularly acute following the Debtors’ acquisition of the Gogo Commercial Aviation business unit, combined with limited available capacity in the aforementioned geographies today,” Intelsat stated in its filing.

The filing redacted the cost of the two satellites, but noted an initial milestone payment was due Jan. 8. The court issued an order authorizing the satellite contract Jan. 7.

The Intelsat deal brings the total number of OneSat satellites ordered to six. Inmarsat ordered three of the spacecraft in May 2019 as part of the expansion of its Global Xpress fleet. Australian operator Optus ordered a OneSat satellite, Optus 11, in July 2020."

Initially the A220 will begin flying this spring before entering scheduled service by mid-June on JetBlue’s Boston – Fort Lauderdale, Fla. route. New cities, routes and markets will be evaluated in the future as more aircraft join the JetBlue fleet.

Economics & the Environment

The A220 boasts a nearly 30 percent lower direct operating cost per seat than the current Embraer 190. The A220 is powered exclusively by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, which deliver double-digit improvements in fuel and carbon emissions. Optimizing fuel burn is an important first step in JetBlue’s cost-conscious sustainability strategy, and prioritizing fuel-efficient aircraft and engines aligns with JetBlue’s approach to reducing emissions. Earlier this year, JetBlue became the first major U.S. airline to achieve carbon neutrality for all domestic flights, and later announced its plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040.

JetBlue continues to navigate the new travel environment with a steady hand and a long-term view on recovery. The investment in the A220 allows the airline to continue to execute its low cost business model, and enables JetBlue to continue to offer low fares to more customers.

This jet, outfitted with just 102 seats, is the most premium in the entire fleet. It sports a 10-seat Flagship First cabin, 20 seats of lie-flat Flagship Business and 72 in coach, with half in the extra-legroom Main Cabin Extra configuration.

The A321T will fly the following route for March 2021, as confirmed by the carrier:

American Flight 3: JFK - LAX 12 p.m. - 3:24 p.m.

American Flight 4: LAX - JFK 2 p.m. - 10:21 p.m.

Additionally, AA is boosting the JFK to San Francisco (SFO) frequency from once-daily to twice-daily, with both flights operated by the A321T, according to Cirium schedules.

In a statement, American confirmed the move, saying:

The A321T will start to return in March, supplementing some of the widebody flying that has been operating over the past few months. As customers safely return to the sky, we look forward to bringing back the product they know and love on an important route.

Before the pandemic, the A321T was a mainstay on American's transcon routes. With rare exception, every flight between the cities was operated by this plane.

Once the pandemic hit, however, the transcon strategy changed.

Back in November, Brian Znotins, AA's vice president of network planning, explained to TPG why the A321T was largely grounded, in favor of larger Boeing 777s, with many more coach seats than premium ones in the pointy end of the plane.

""It's pretty simple. The A321T is a business-focused aircraft and there's very little business demand right now,"" Znotins told TPG. ""VFR (visiting friends and relatives) and leisure demand"" warrants a ""low-frequency, high-gauge schedule,"" he added.

More: American Airlines details the future of the A321T

Despite Znotins' confirmation that the A321T would be back, several reports surfaced in late November questioning AA's commitment to the premium-heavy jet. Some rumored that the plane would never return, theorizing that American would convert the jets to a standard, domestic configuration with a handful of first-class recliners and a large coach cabin.

Fortunately, for AA flyers, Monday's news appears to squash such rumors.

American isn't ready to boost its frequencies to pre-pandemic levels, though. Despite re-adding the A321T to the schedule, the carrier will only fly three daily LAX frequencies in March 2021, down from roughly 11 per day one year ago.

The timing of the A321T's return coincides with the recent news that American's Northeast-focused alliance with JetBlue was just approved by regulators. One of the many promised benefits of the tie-up include coordinating transcon routes from New York, where JetBlue currently flies its Mint-equipped A321s.

Additionally, the carrier promised (at least) two new long-haul routes from JFK as part of the alliance, one to Athens and the other to Tel Aviv. Both flights were loaded for sale over the weekend.

As for American's other routes, the carrier confirmed that its March schedule will be approximately 36% smaller than the same time period in 2019, in an effort to match low demand resulting from COVID-19."

Emirates is known for luxurious aircraft and spares no expense , especially in its premium cabins. In first class on the A380, for example, passengers not only sit in gold-accented private suites, but have access to the master bathroom that comes with its own shower

The Middle Eastern mega carrier unveiled a massive overhaul to its flagship aircraft that sees every cabin receiving enhancements and even the addition of a premium economy class, a first for 35-year-old Emirates. The first A380 complete with the upgrades has already arrived in Dubai with more to be delivered in the next two years.

Emirates is one of the few airlines still flying the Airbus A380, a dying breed of aircraft that will soon stop being produced by Airbus. But the world’s largest operator of the A380 isn’t giving up on the world’s largest passenger jet just yet.

And while other airlines have moved to discard the A380 during the pandemic due to its high operating costs, Emirates – an early adopter of the aircraft – still has nothing but praise for it. “It’s palatial,” Emirates president said Tim Clark. “And people absolutely love it. They still go out of their way to get on the 380.”

Here’s a look inside one of Emirates’ new Airbus A380s.

The aircraft quite literally towers over anything else in Emirates’ passenger fleet as the only double-decker aircraft the airline flies. And it’s become a status symbol for the airline, with Emirates first class on the A380 being one of the pinnacles of airborne luxury

Emirates’ A380s can be found flying as far as New York, Sydney or Hong Kong from Dubai, or as close as Muscat, Oman. But no matter the distance, the opulence of the A380 is the same on every flight. Case in point: Emirates offers an in-flight shower for first class passengers on the A380. Premium cabin customers can also visit the in-flight bar on the A380’s upper deck.

And now it’s time for an upgrade, starting with installing ergonomically designed economy seats throughout the entire 338-seat cabin. Emirates calls them game-changer seats and says they’re lighter with no sacrifice of comfort. They’ll also feature new 34cm (13.3-inch) in-flight entertainment screens and have tray tables complete with wood finishes.

The soft colour palette resembles the desert landscape of the UAE and seats come complete with leather adjustable headrests. The new A380s also feature Emirates’ first premium economy cabin with 56 recliner seats in a standard two-four-two configuration. Along the cabin walls are new wood finishes – a key theme in the redesign – surrounding the windows.

The seat-back screens are the same size as those in economy at 34cm …

And the folding tray tables have the same wood finishes. A key feature of premium economy is the recliner seats that come with a leg and foot rest.

And that’s just the first floor; the business class and first class cabins are located on the second floor.

Business class seats now feature champagne-colour finishes and more wood panelling. First class is also receiving wider suites with taller doors for more privacy. The in-flight bar is getting an upgrade, as well, with new seating areas and a more luxurious colour palette similar to what’s found in business class.

First class passengers will notice more wood panelling in the shower spa and more modern touches.

No other existing aircraft will receive the premium economy cabin, but Emirates says it will opt for the cabin on a future arrival, the Boeing 777X. The world’s largest twin-engined jet is expected to be delivered to Emirates in 2023. It’s currently flying test flights around the Pacific northwest in preparation for certification.

Emirates is considering retrofitting its existing A380 fleet to the new standard, but the company has to weigh whether it’s worth the investment for a plane whose days are numbered.

Airbus will stop producing the A380 in 2021 after its final delivery to Emirates. The final fuselage has already arrived in Toulouse, France, where Airbus pieces together the A380. Clark said that the aircraft will hopefully fly for another decade. Emirates has over 100 A380s in its fleet at the moment.

Air France retired its A380 fleet after just 11 years, citing the pandemic as the reason since it couldn’t fill the 516-seat aircraft any more. The four-engine aircrafts are also too costly to operate at a time when every penny counts.

They’ve also been largely grounded by the few airlines still operating the A380, including British Airways, Qantas, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Korean Air, among others.

The sun is setting on the A380, but it will at least be going out in style with Emirates’ new design.

"Airbus Closed 2020 With Intelsat OneSat Order, Forecasts More Deals This Year - Via Satellite","Fri, 08 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9sYXVuY2gvMjAyMS8wMS8wOC9haXJidXMtY2xvc2VkLTIwMjAtd2l0aC1pbnRlbHNhdC1vbmVzYXQtb3JkZXItZm9yZWNhc3RzLW1vcmUtZGVhbHMtdGhpcy15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last year, Airbus had the target of selling three of its new flexible OneSat satellites to customers around the world. Between January 1st 2020 and December 30th 2020, it had only sold one and was in danger of missing a key target. But on Dec 31, Airbus signed a two-satellite deal with Intelsat, hitting its target literally with hours to spare.

The satellites will be based on the Airbus OneSat product line, the latest generation of fully flexible, in-orbit reconfigurable, software-defined satellites. The OneSat satellites are designed to deliver the optimal balance between performance, flexibility and competitive cost per bit. The two next generation satellites will be delivered in 2023.

The satellites are likely to be launched in 2024, Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Airbus Space Systems, said conference call with journalists after the order was announced on Jan. 8.

Nasr was confident about the state of the satellite market today. He said the number of Geostationary (GEO) satellite orders in 2020 didn’t take a dip that could have been expected due to COVID. He said companies weren’t questioning investments and pulling out, and the pipeline for satellite orders remained stable and robust. Nasr is also confident there will be more deals signed in 2021, and that the market is not going to take any kind of significant dip. “My impression is that the GEO market is not going to slow down,” Nasr said.

Last year, Airbus also signed a deal for a fully reconfigurable telecoms satellite from Australia’s second largest telecommunications company and leading satellite operator Optus. The OneSat deal was Airbus’s first contract from Optus. Airbus also signed a three OneSat satellite deal with Inmarsat in May 2019.

Even though though these satellites ordered previously are a couple of years away from launching, Nasr expects Airbus to sign potentially another three OneSat orders in 2021, and said there is “real traction’ for the OneSat product range.

Steve Spengler, Intelsat’s CEO said in the release that Intelsat’s investment in Airbus software-defined satellites “marks an important first step in evolving the world’s largest, most resilient, integrated space and ground network.” He also said this satellite will enable GoGo Commercial Aviation in-flight broadband services, and other managed services for Intelsat customers."

Last week, Airbus (EADSY -1.30%) reported its final order and delivery numbers for 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic, which crushed the global airline industry last year, weighed heavily on its results. Still, considering the magnitude of the crisis, Airbus had a very solid year. Let's take a look.

A December deliveries surge

It has become a common pattern for Airbus to build up inventory of its commercial jets during the year and then scramble to deliver as many as possible in December. The pandemic aggravated this tendency in 2020, as many airlines refused to take delivery of new jets during the spring and summer, due to financial problems and government restrictions that complicated the aircraft delivery process.

Indeed, Airbus delivered just 341 commercial jets in the first nine months of 2020, down from 571 in the prior-year period. That left it with a backlog of about 135 jets that it had built but had been unable to deliver because of the pandemic.

However, delivery activity has rebounded in recent months. Airbus delivered 72 jets in October and 64 jets in November. Its year-end deliveries report revealed that it handed 89 jets over to customers in December. That gave Airbus 225 deliveries for the fourth quarter and 566 for the full year: down 34% year over year. Previous reports had indicated that it would likely deliver at least 550 commercial aircraft in 2020.

Airbus has been building about 51 commercial jets per month since adjusting production last spring: far fewer than it has delivered over the past three months. This implies that the company cleared out at least half of the undelivered jets that were sitting in its inventory entering the fourth quarter. That probably allowed Airbus to generate strong free cash flow last quarter, partially offsetting its high cash burn in the first half of 2020.

The backlog remains impressive

Airlines are likely to adopt a cautious attitude toward capital expenditures for the next couple of years, as they work to repair their balance sheets and avoid overcommitting themselves until it's clear that demand is recovering. That will keep aircraft deliveries below 2019 levels in the near term.

However, Airbus is extremely well positioned for an eventual recovery in aircraft demand. It captured new orders for 383 aircraft -- 268 net of cancellations -- during 2020. (The vast majority of those came in January, before the pandemic swept across the globe.) This gave it an astounding backlog of 7,184 firm orders at year-end.

Undoubtedly, some of these so-called firm orders will be canceled in the years ahead, as financially weak airlines that have ordered too many aircraft are forced to rethink their plans. Yet even after factoring in some order cancellations, there is clearly enough demand for Airbus' products to support a return to 2019 production levels (if not higher) within a few years.

A better bet than Boeing

Airbus' 2020 performance was far and away better than that of its main rival, Boeing (BA -1.96%). The U.S. aerospace giant delivered a fraction of the number of planes that its European rival did, and a slew of order cancellations shrank its order backlog. While the 737 MAX grounding contributed to Boeing's woes, the recertification of that troubled jet is not a panacea for the company. The 737 MAX's fundamental performance limitations relative to Airbus' single-aisle jets and weak demand for wide-bodies -- especially the largest models like the Boeing 777X -- will likely put pressure on the business for years.

Despite Airbus' vastly superior performance in 2020 and its stronger prospects for the next decade, Airbus stock has barely outperformed Boeing stock over the past year. Airbus also has a lower market cap than its U.S. rival.

Historically, Boeing has been better than Airbus at turning strong aircraft sales into commensurate profits and free cash flow. However, that could change going forward, particularly because all of Airbus' go-forward aircraft families have been updated recently and are now maturing (which should bring production costs down). As a result, Airbus stock looks like an intriguing bet for long-term investors."

On Friday, the aircraft manufacturer announced that the first class of FlightPath9 had completed its course of study and joined the Airbus workforce in Mobile.

Daryl Taylor, general manager of Airbus’ U.S. manufacturing facility, praised the group for persevering through circumstances that no one could have anticipated: A global pandemic that drastically reduced air travel, resulting in a massive slowdown in the industry that the trainees were preparing to join. Originally designed to take place over the course of one school year, the program ended up taking nearly twice that long as classes were shifted on online formats.

“I am extraordinarily proud of Team Mobile for creating the FlightPath9 program and seeing the inaugural class through to graduation,” said Taylor. “When presented with the unique challenges of a pandemic, the students, instructors, administrators, and sponsors of FlightPath9 met those challenges with remarkable grit and courage.”

The class started with 25 participating students; a company spokesperson said that 17 FlightPath9 participants had become Airbus employees. The company has not yet set a date for the launch of a second class: the spokesman said Airbus is “reviewing the current impacts of COVID-19 in assessing the timeline” for signing and training the next group.

Gov. Kay Ivey, who came to Mobile in 2019 for the initial unveiling of the program, also praised the advancement of its first class.

“From the very beginning, the State of Alabama has been a partner with Airbus in creating economic growth and opportunity and now we have worked together to begin a long-term process of training our youth to become the business and manufacturing leaders of the future,” said Ivey. “Many thanks to all who gave of their time and effort to get us to this historic milestone.”

According to information provided by Airbus, the training program “was created by Flight Works Alabama, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education organization located at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, along with partners from the State of Alabama, Southwest Alabama Partnership for Training and Employment, local businesses and education institutions.” The overall pathway consists of two programs: FlightPath9, which provides extracurricular training for high school students, and the Fast Track program, which provides additional training to help create “a gateway to an aerospace career without a college degree or prior experience.”

The first class included students from 11 area high schools, with the largest contingents coming from B.C. Rain and McGill-Toolen Catholic High School.

Among graduates, there was a distinct note of pride in Friday’s announcement.

“The pandemic stretched a nine-month process into a year-and-a-half, and yet we stayed true to the program,” said graduate Joseph White, one of several students quoted in the Airbus announcement.

“FlightPath9 changed my life by giving me a great opportunity to come right out of high school (to Airbus),” said program graduate Yuriy Greenlay. “Words cannot explain my gratitude for being in the first class of FP9.”"

Digital simulations and wind tunnels are all well and good, but there comes a point in aerospace engineering when a new technology has to be installed in an actual aircraft to see if it really does what it's supposed to. For this, Airbus has developed a number of Flightlabs, including the A340 MSN1 for studying laminar flow on larger aircraft, and the 350 Airspace Explorer for testing connected cabin technologies while in flight.

Now the company has added the H130 helicopter Flightlab. Though it's only now starting technology tests, the flying lab has been conducting urban sound tests with the French civil aviation authority since last April to understand how people perceive helicopter noises and how buildings affect these perceptions, which will be important as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) becomes more common.

H130 Flightlab infographic Airbus Helicopters

Now, the Flightlab is looking at a number of new technologies designed to improve flight safety and operability. These include the EAGLE image detection system, which uses computer vision for automatically identifying obstacles and for the 3D reconstruction of landing zones; the Rotor Strike Alerting System (RSAS), which alerts pilots to the danger of rotor collision risks by identifying the direction of the nearest obstacle; the Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), which keeps an electronic eye on the systems of light helicopters; new UAM controls that improve the ergonomics of helicopter interfaces to make them more intuitive; and the Engine Back-up System (EBS), which is a 100-kW propulsion system connected to the main rotor that takes over in the event of an engine failure.

""Investing in the future remains essential, even in times of crisis, especially when those innovations bring added value to our customers by targeting increased safety, reduced pilot workload, and reduced sound levels,"" says Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. ""Having a dedicated platform to test these new technologies brings the future of flight a step closer and is a clear reflection of our priorities at Airbus Helicopters.""

The first five-bladed H145 delivery in Canada is scheduled to take place in mid-2021 to an air medical customer, and an additional order from a multi-mission operator was placed at the end of last year.

“The enhanced performance capabilities of the new five-bladed H145 will help to further mission success for our customers in Canada, and we stand ready to support its upcoming entry into service,” said Dwayne Charette, President and COO of Airbus Helicopters Canada. “We are grateful to the team at Transport Canada for enabling us to meet this important milestone, while mitigating various challenges linked to the global pandemic we all continue to face.”

This type certification covers the full range of capabilities, including single-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR) and single engine operations (Cat.A/VTOL), along with night vision goggle capability. This newest version of the H145 family adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor system to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 330 lbs (150 kg). The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also simplify maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.

Particularly suited to high-altitude environments, the H145 set its skids down during a test campaign on the Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Southern hemisphere, further proving its capabilities even in harsh conditions. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and Airbus’s own Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload."

Lifeseeker uses signals from a missing person’s mobile phone to guide search and rescue (SAR) teams to the right place quickly. It helps make SAR missions more effective and efficient, saving lives and optimizing operational costs.

Lifeseeker turns the phone into a beacon. It creates its own network to triangulate the exact location of the missing person’s phone, making it independent from mobile phone networks. Importantly, it does not rely on line of sight, meaning it is effective in all weathers and all terrains, night and day, even if the missing person is hidden by trees, or even buried in snow or rubble.

Lifeseeker can also be used to communicate with the missing person to assess any immediate medical needs, the best place to pick them up and so on. However, Lifeseeker does not rely on the missing person taking any action.

Héctor Estévez, CEO of CENTUM, said, “Everyone has a mobile phone which now means we all have a rescue beacon. As soon as we find the phone, we find the person. We know the technology works because it is already helping save lives in Europe.

“The Covid pandemic has made us all appreciate nature and the outdoors more than ever. And being in the mountains is one of the few activities we can do in the current circumstances. What we’ve heard from search and rescue teams is that more people than ever are heading to the mountains and that will only increase as skiing opens up. Now really is the time to review the available technology to ensure every SAR team has what it needs to be as successful as possible.”

Airbus managed the certification process to the highest industry standards. Lifeseeker is now available for SAR teams around the world on the H145 platform, and the Type Certificate is available from Airbus for further installations.

The H145 is used by SAR teams globally. It combines a large cabin space, ease of access through wide sliding doors, low noise levels, smooth flights and a small D-value, which means it can land in tight spaces.

The Lifeseeker airborne hardware is enclosed in a small 15kg unit, measuring 360mm x 240mm x 171mm. Combined with CENTUM’s proprietary algorithm, the system provides highly accurate geolocation. The user interface is very straightforward to operate and Lifeseeker can be operated using either a PC or a tablet.

A miniaturized version of the hardware can also be used in drones, for shorter range missions.

[Photo/Agencies]

BEIJING -- Airbus delivered a total of 99 commercial aircraft to China in 2020, representing 17.5 percent of its annual global deliveries, according to Airbus China.

China's market has played a vital role in sustaining and leading the global civil aviation industry to recover from the severe impact of COVID-19, Airbus China said.

The aircraft deliveries supported the continuous growth of China's civil aviation fleet and promoted its stable development, the company said, adding that Airbus endeavored to ensure all deliveries in full compliance with health and safety regulations for each individual involved.

Statistics showed that in the first quarter of 2020, aircraft deliveries to China's market represented 6 percent of Airbus' global deliveries. In the fourth quarter, the proportion rose to 25 percent of the European planemaker's global deliveries.

By the end of 2020, there were more than 1,900 commercial Airbus planes serving the Chinese market, according to data from Airbus China.

""China's civil aviation market has shown its resilience during the pandemic. It has brought confidence to global aviation industry players like Airbus,"" said George Xu, CEO of Airbus China.

""China plays strategic roles in the global civil aviation market, and Airbus remains consistent in its commitment to China,"" Xu said.

Airbus in 2008 inaugurated the Airbus A320 family final assembly line in North China's Tianjin. By the end of 2020, Airbus had assembled and delivered more than 500 commercial aircraft from the facility.

Airbus is committed to extending the capacities of its Tianjin facility from narrow-body A320 series aircraft to wide-body A350 series aircraft, according to Airbus China.

The first A350 aircraft delivery from its Tianjin center is expected in the first half of 2021, the company said.

China's civil aviation sector has remained the world's second-largest in terms of passenger trips for 15 years, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

The latest statistics from the CAAC show that China's civil aviation sector handled 420 million passenger trips in 2020 -- 63.3 percent of the 2019 figure -- indicating recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic fallout."
Airbus A320 Completely Tangled in Streamers After Mid-Air Collision With Giant Party Balloon - The Drive,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzM4NTkyL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWdldHMtdGFuZ2xlZC1pbi1zdHJlYW1lcnMtYWZ0ZXItaGl0dGluZy1odWdlLW5ldy15ZWFycy1wYXJ0eS1iYWxsb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2020 was a dumpster fire of a year, and many people were glad to put it to bed early by going there themselves. Others, however, stayed up to watch the year take its last breath, though not everyone sang Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead in wise ways. One group of revelers in Colombia released a large balloon complete with streamers which, rather than stay aloft over their party, floated to a nearby airport where an airliner landing from Orlando, Florida collided with it.

The plane in question was an Airbus A320 belonging to Avianca, a Colombian airline and the second-oldest in the world. Flying Avianca's AV29 route from Orlando to Bogota, the capitol of Colombia, the Airbus collided with the balloon upon landing at El Dorado International Airport, approximately 10:09 pm local time on New Year's Eve according to Colombian aviation authorities, via The Aviation Herald. The balloon's streamers reportedly entangled both wings, engines, and stabilizers, though the Airbus's crew kept the craft under control, and according to View From the Wing did not declare an emergency. Images and video of the incident's aftermath have since circulated online, depicting the airliner bedight in what could pass for the remains of a flock of tropical birds.

Authorities reportedly suspect the balloon was launched from the nearby Parque La Florida, a park located 1.3 miles from the point of impact, which is regularly used for New Year's festivities. Release of such balloons, however, is not on the up-and-up according a quoted statement from Avianca.

""Avianca makes a call to the public to refrain from burning such balloons, which are prohibited by authorities,"" reads the statement shared by The Aviation Herald. ""Passengers who had connections to other destinations were able to do so without any inconvenience.""

Air traffic monitor Flight Radar 24 registers no flights since the New Year for the implicated aircraft, which has presumably been undergoing cleaning and maintenance since the collision. A return to the air, however, is scheduled this Friday, meaning unlike the colorlessness of 2020, the damage this balloon caused is safely in the past."
"Emirates adds many more US flights, Airbus A380 returns in March - The Points Guy","Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2VtaXJhdGVzLWFkZGluZy1tb3JlLXVzLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Up until early last year, Emirates had a superjumbo presence at New York-JFK, flying the Airbus A380 on multiple flights every day. The airline quickly scaled back its U.S. service early during the pandemic, though, including just one daily flight between New York and Dubai, with the smaller Boeing 777-300ER.

Now, the global giant is planning to ramp up its service to the United States, and has even added an A380 back to the schedule, joining the 777-300ER with a second daily flight between Dubai (DXB) and New York beginning March 28, 2021, according to data on TPG sister site ExpertFlyer.

Emirates is also scaling up operations across the country, resuming flights between Dubai and:

Seattle (SEA): four days a week, beginning Feb. 2

Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW): three days a week, beginning March 3

San Francisco (SFO): four days a week, beginning March 2

The San Francisco flight will be operated by a Boeing 777-300ER, which includes a first-class cabin and 2-3-2 angle-flat seating in business class, while the Dallas and Seattle flights will have a 777-200LR, with no first-class suites, but business class in a more spacious 2-2-2 arrangement.

These flights join current service to Boston (BOS), Chicago (ORD), Houston (IAH), Los Angeles (LAX) and Washington, D.C. (IAD), which will all maintain their current schedules, with the exception of LAX, which will move from five days per week to daily service beginning Feb. 1, operated by a Boeing 777-300ER.

As for the New York route, while the Boeing 777-300ER offers a superior first-class suite — affectionately named the Emirates ""Game Changer"" — the Airbus A380 has a whopping 14 suites in first class, compared with just six on the newer 777, opening up many more opportunities to book premium-cabin awards.

Unfortunately for U.S. travelers, March 27 is the last day you'll find the airline's latest suite flying to New York, identified by a seat map with just six first-class suites, arranged in a 1-1-1 configuration:

Beginning on March 28, Emirates flight 202 will shift from the 777-300ER with the newer suite to the A380, which sports a large cabin with a 1-2-1 layout in first class:

For business-class flyers, the A380 is the much better pick, with a far more spacious 1-2-1 layout. That larger plane also offers more amenities, including two first-class showers and a staffed bar in business class, which is accessible to all business and first-class passengers onboard."

Thales and Airbus beat out German manufacturer OHB for the contract, and will each produce six satellites for the 12-satellite constellation. OHB is building the final 12 Galileo first-generation satellites, which will support the system until the first batch of second-generation Galileo satellites is launched at the end of 2024.

“With their new capabilities relying on high innovative technologies (digitally configurable antennas, inter- satellites links, new atomic clocks technologies, use of full electric propulsion systems), these satellites will improve the accuracy of Galileo as well as the robustness and resilience of its signal, which will be key for the upcoming digital decade as well as more security and military usage,” the EC said in an official announcement.

The Galileo system has been in operation since 2016 and is currently composed of 26 satellites in orbit. The system provides signal services to 2 billion users around the globe. Two additional Galileo satellites are scheduled for launch in the third quarter of this year."

JetBlue is currently expecting to take delivery of 69 more Airbus A220 aircraft, all from the family’s -300 variant. The remaining planes will be delivered in a phased manner.

This low-cost carrier aims to replace its current fleet of 60 Embraer 190 by the more efficient A220 jets. According to the carrier, the A220 will cost 30% less to operate per seat than the existing E190. A220 aircraft has longer maintenance intervals and improved reliability that will inevitably reduce maintenance cost per seat by more than 40%. The A220 is powered exclusively by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, which deliver double-digit improvements in fuel and carbon emissions. This reduction in per-seat emission will enable JetBlue to move closer to its target of achieving net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040.

Robin Hayes, CEO, JetBlue, stated, “The A220 is a next-generation aircraft our customers and crewmembers will love, featuring impressive range and superior economics to support critical financial and operating priorities along with new network planning flexibility”.

The company aims to reveal the details of the modernized customer-friendly A220 cabin later this month.

A high-level delegation from Airbus led by Commercial Vice President for Africa Hadi Akoum met with Transport Minister Vincent Dabilgou in Ouagadougou on January 21, 2021. “Exchanges included the acquisition of Airbus A220 aircraft,” according to a statement by the ministry posted on social media.

It said the plan to acquire Airbus aircraft for Air Burkina formed part of a business plan for the partial privatisation of Air Burkina resulting from the October 2020 partnership agreement between the government and US-European investment consortium American Global Development Group (AGD). In terms of this, AGD on January 1, 2021, acquired an 80% stake in the airline in exchange for an injection of XOF250 billion CFA francs (USD449.9 million) for the fleet renewal programme, while the government retains 20%.

“As part of the business plan (resulting) from the partnership with the American Global Development Group, it is planned to acquire Airbus aircraft for our national flag carrier, Air Burkina. It is within this framework that the delegation of Airbus was received by Transport Minister Vincent Dabilgou,” the statement read.

The ministry said discussions centred on technical specifications, and requirements surrounding capacity, crew, and markets.

The minister “welcomed Airbus’s approach, which, beyond the commercial aspect, shared Burkina Faso’s outlook for the sector”. The minister had also expressed the wish for the acquisition to take place no later than July 2022 to enable Air Burkina to meet development needs.

“As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in discussions on fleet requirements, the content of these discussions remains confidential,” responded Airbus spokesperson Samsana Ismail.

Initial news reports said the restructuring would involve expanding Air Burkina's fleet to 13 aircraft, including six A320-200Ns or A321-200Ns, three E145s, and three Cessna (single turboprop) Grand Caravans; as well as an ACJ319-100. Long-term route network plans include direct services to Europe. An aeronautical training academy and MRO centre are to be established at the cost of XOF58 billion (USD104.3 million).

The fact that the smaller A220-300 is now being considered reflects an adjustment of plans, likely as a result of reduced traffic demand following COVID-19. With a maximum range of 6,297km, the A220-300 is within easy reach of Europe from Burkina Faso (flying distance to Paris is just over 4,000km).

According to the ch-aviation fleets ownership module, the airline at present operates three aircraft leased from Nordic Aviation Capital, including one E175 and two E195."

The Inside Story of How Alaska Airlines Went All-In on the Returning Boeing 737 Max - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMjIvdGhlLWluc2lkZS1zdG9yeS1vZi1ob3ctYWxhc2thLWFpcmxpbmVzLXdlbnQtYWxsLWluLW9uLXRoZS1yZXR1cm5pbmctYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yMi90aGUtaW5zaWRlLXN0b3J5LW9mLWhvdy1hbGFza2EtYWlybGluZXMtd2VudC1hbGwtaW4tb24tdGhlLXJldHVybmluZy1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alaska was the first airline to officially throw its support behind Boeing's beleaguered 737 Max after the jet was ungrounded, with commitments for 36 more aircraft. But it was a long and winding road to that decision with the seed planted in its merger with Virgin America four years earlier.

December 14, 2016 was a momentous day for Alaska Airlines. The carrier closed its $2.6 billion acquisition of Virgin America, vaulting it ahead of fellow bidder JetBlue Airways to become the fifth largest airline by passengers in the U.S.

“Together, we’ll offer more flights, with low fares, more rewards and more for customers to love,” said Alaska CEO Brad Tilden that day. “The two airlines may look different, but our core customer and employee focus is very much the same.”

Veiled by the optimism of the day, was the seed of a strategic challenge for Alaska that would weigh on it in the years to come. Virgin, while having a complementary route network, was an all-Airbus A320 family operator whereas Alaska touted “proudly all Boeing” on the noses of its 150-plus 737 jets.

“The study and the work basically started the day after the merger,” Alaska senior vice president of fleet, finance & alliances Nathaniel Pieper told Skift in an interview. In other words, executives at the airline’s Seattle headquarters began weighing what to do about Virgin’s 61 A319s and A320s since December 15, 2016.

Alaska finally solved the challenge nearly four-years to the day of buying Virgin America. On December 22, the carrier ordered 23 737 Max 9 jets that, when combined with a deal to lease 13 Maxes the month before, would allow it to be rid of the former Virgin aircraft by 2023. However, Alaska will not return to its “proudly all Boeing” moniker: 10 A321neos ordered by Virgin but only flown by Alaska will remain for the foreseeable future.

The Max order, while notable considering the jet’s 20-plus month long grounding that ended in November, was expected but interviews by Skift reveal the complexity behind how the decision was rendered.

Alaska not only flies more 737s than A320s, it also has a multi-decade relationship with Boeing. The planemaker also happens to assemble the 737 in Renton, Wash., just a few miles from the airline’s corporate offices next to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. And while Alaska publicly considered both the A321neo and 737 Max 9 for its replacement needs, any industry expert will tell you the deal was Boeing’s to lose.

“There’s a rather strong case to be made that Alaska is actually closer now to Boeing than Southwest,” said The Air Current editor-in-chief Jon Ostrower in 2019. Southwest Airlines being the iconic 737 operator having flown the type nearly exclusively since its founding in 1971.

How Alaska’s Max Deal Came Together

Alaska hired Pieper to, among other things, figure out its fleet puzzle. He joined the airline in August 2019 after a career at Delta Air Lines where he was the driving force behind the carrier’s landmark widebody jet order for Airbus A330neos and A350s in 2014. The planes are now the backbone of Delta’s widebody fleet since it opted to retire its Boeing 777s early amid Covid-related cuts.

“We needed to answer what’s the right balance between being a sole-source aircraft operator or having a competitive tension between Airbus and Boeing going forward,” Pieper said of his team’s work in late 2019.

The A320 and 737 are long-standing rivals. The respective families are the best selling aircraft in the world with models available in various sizes and with different ranges. Most airlines opt for one family — for example, the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo make up one such grouping — and the operational savings associated with their common training and maintenance needs. For example, Southwest has long credited its all-737 fleet as a key part of its financial success.

Not every airline follows this one-family-fits-all mantra. The big three U.S. carriers American Airlines, Delta and United Airlines all fly a mix of A320 and 737 family jets. They argue that the commercial advantages of both planes outweigh the added complexities owing to the sheer size of their fleets. At the end of 2019, the smallest of among them flew at least three-times more jets than Alaska.

By early 2020, Alaska had a plan to play Airbus and Boeing off each other. It would consider the A321neo — a jet that airline executives sang the praises of to Wall Street analysts — and the 737 Max 9 to replace the A319s and A320s. Both jets benefitted from the latest engine technology and fuel efficiency on the market, plus had room for dozens more passengers than either of the Airbus models they would replace.

But these best laid plans were quickly waylaid by the coronavirus pandemic. Almost overnight, Alaska was flying a fraction of its schedule with much of its fleet parked. The airline retired 12 jets — all 10 of its A319s and two A320s — in the early days of the crisis.

Pieper, who is also Alaska’s treasurer, and other executives shifted their focus to raising liquidity to keep the airline afloat. Daily losses — or cash burn — peaked at nearly $13 million a day in March, prompting a dire need for more cash in the bank. This arrived in the form of new debt and relief funds from the federal coronavirus aid package, or CARES Act. By summer, the carrier’s leadership was comfortable that it could weather the crisis ahead.

“We were projecting we were going to return to our pre-Covid level in summer of 2022,” Pieper said of Alaska’s crisis planning. A timeframe that was “actually a pretty good time, if you’re going to simplify your fleet, to go do it.”

By late summer, with liquidity up and cash burn down, Alaska returned to the question of its Airbus fleet. At that point, the airline still had 49 A320s on its books with another seven planes due to leave in 2021. The remaining 42 jets were still a sizable part of its fleet, flying on many of its core routes up and down the West Coast.

“Given the state of the market — Boeing with the Max and seeking to get that program back and running again, [and] knowing that Airbus wasn’t selling a lot of airplanes either — [we thought] ‘hmm, maybe it’s a good time to get into the market,’” said Pieper.

Airlines can lock in better deals buying in a downturn when planemakers are eager to sell planes to make up for lost orders. Boeing lost some 710 orders for the 737 Max, a combination of both the grounding and coronavirus, while Airbus netted a historically low 56 orders for the A320 family during 2020.

Alaska was not alone in this thinking. Irish discounter Ryanair inked a deal for 75 more Maxes in the weeks after the aircraft was re-certified. And Southwest has reportedly talked to Boeing about acquiring some of the assembled jets who no longer have buyers, or “white tails” in aviation parlance.

Arriving at a deal was not all clear skies for Alaska. Early in the fall, lessors reportedly rebuffed proposals by the airline to swap A320s for 737s. The owners of many of those A320s were also hit by the crisis, and were not eager to give up the lucrative lease rates of the former-Virgin agreements with few potential takers for the used planes.

Ultimately, Alaska and Boeing were able to reach a deal. The decision ultimately came down to “math,” as Pieper put it. While the A321neo offered slightly more seats and better performance on certain routes, the Max 9 was cheaper with a lower weight that offered operational savings on many of the airline’s routes.

The list price of the A321neo was nearly $130 million in 2018 — the latest number from Airbus — and the Max 9 nearly $129 million. However, planemakers almost always give airlines lucrative discounts for new orders.

“The way that you get the best answer for your airline is, you find the airplane that matches the route network so that you’re using most of its range,” said Pieper. “It’s like having a Ferrari in a 30 mile-an-hour speed limit — it looks awesome but you’re never going to get to use the power and all of the other components of that car.”

Asked whether Alaska ever had any doubts in the Max given its history, Pieper said no. The airline needed to have confidence in the jet given its existing commitments for 32 Max 9s, otherwise its entire order book was in question.

In addition, he declined to say when Airbus was out of the game. However, based on the airline’s public comments and disclosures, the Max was the clear front runner by late summer. The first piece of the replacement puzzle, the swap deal with Air Lease, was not officially announced until November 23.

According to Alaska, the 737 Max 9 is 20 percent more fuel efficient with 19 percent more seats than the aircraft it replaces. These are savings the airline can take to the bank once it retires its last A320 in 2023.

The carrier now has orders for 68 737 Max 9s — seven more than the number of A319s and A320s it had at the beginning of 2020 — and options for another 52 jets. It has the flexibility to swap the Max 9 for either the smaller Max 8 or larger Max 10.

Neither Airbus nor Boeing were available to comment on Alaska’s order.

March Max Debut

Alaska is ready to debut its first 737 Max in March. The jet is scheduled to arrive this Sunday outfitted with 178 seats, the same number as on its 737-900ERs. The aircraft is one of the 32 Maxes ordered in 2012, not one of the 36 commitments added to replace the A320s.

The airline plans to debut the Max on flights between Seattle and both Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as between Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles on March 1. As at other airlines, travelers will be notified they are on a Max before their flight and given the option to change their itinerary free of charge if they have any misgivings about the jet.

American was the first to resume 737 Max flying in the U.S. on December 29. United is due to follow with Max flights beginning on 12 routes from its Denver and Houston hubs on February 11.

“It’s really exciting to be closing in on” the first delivery, said Pieper. “We’re all systems go.”"

Emirates is one of the few airlines still flying the Airbus A380, a dying breed of aircraft that will soon stop being produced by Airbus. But the world's largest operator of the A380 isn't giving up on the world's largest passenger jet.

The Middle Eastern mega carrier on Tuesday unveiled a massive overhaul to its flagship aircraft that sees every cabin receiving enhancements and even the addition of a premium economy class, a first for 35-year-old Emirates. The first A380 complete with the upgrades has already arrived in Dubai with more to be delivered in the next two years.

Emirates is known for luxurious aircraft, as Insider's Rachel Hosie found while touring the airline's A380 at the 2019 Dubai Air Show, and spares no expense, especially in its premium cabins. In first class on the A380, for example, passengers not only sit in gold-accented privates suites but have access to the master bathroom with its own shower.

And while other airlines have moved to discard the A380 during the pandemic due to its high operating costs, Emirates still has nothing but praise for the aircraft. ""It's palatial,"" CEO Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider's David Slotnick in a July interview. ""And people absolutely love it. They still go out of their way to get on the 380.""

The Coveted Jet Built for the Economics of the Pandemic - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMTIvdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItamV0LWJ1aWx0LWZvci10aGUtZWNvbm9taWNzLW9mLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAWVodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzEyL3RoZS13b3JsZHMtbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLWpldC1idWlsdC1mb3ItdGhlLWVjb25vbWljcy1vZi10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A220 is poised to emerge strong from the coronavirus pandemic with airlines keen for its low costs and small capacity. JetBlue is the latest carrier to add the jet as it moves forward with a major fleet transition amid the crisis.

If there is an aviation wunderkind to come out of the coronavirus pandemic, it just might be the Airbus A220.

The small narrowbody jet has proven popular among airlines even as thousands of aircraft were parked amid the historic drop in air travel during the crisis. The A220s size, seating between 100- and 150-passengers, and low costs have proven a sought after elixir to industry executives looking for the lowest cost way to keep flying when every penny matters.

“The A220 was the best performing production passenger airliner,” Cirium head of valuations George Dimitroff told Skift. The jet retained more of its market value compared to other models through 2020 owing to “a combination of its right size for thinner traffic flows, lower fuel burn and trip costs.”

By December, all but 17 of the 137 A220s in service around the globe — or 12 percent of the fleet — were back in service, according to the Cirium Fleets Analyzer database. For comparison, more than 18 percent of all 737s not including the MAX and a quarter of all A320s remain stored.

This is not to say the A220 is more common than either the A320 or 737 in absolute terms. The latter two jets are the world’s most popular narrowbodies with more than 10,000 models in the air at the end of 2020.

But the A220 is a cheaper option for its size. The list price for the larger model, the A220-300, was $91.5 million in 2018, the last year Airbus published the valuations. This compares to $101.5 million for the competing A319neo and about $100 million for the 737 Max 7.

Delta Air Lines kept all of its A220s flying even as it parked some of every other aircraft in its fleet early in the crisis. Air Canada took nearly its full allotment of the jets this year despite deep capacity cuts and the cancellation of some later deliveries. And JetBlue Airways has held steady on taking its first A220 that arrived on New Year’s Eve even as coronavirus losses mounted.

Adding a new type of plane to a fleet is no small matter for an airline. In addition to the cost of buying the aircraft, an all-new variant requires everything from training staff and preparing airports for the new jet, to making sure spare parts are in stock for the inevitable maintenance situation.

But for the latest technology plane that JetBlue sees as key to its future? That cost is worth the use of scarce cash.

“Space”

The cabin of JetBlue’s first Airbus A220 is, slightly ironically, more gray than blue. From seats to the overhead bins and the walls, gray is the dominant palette. Where the airline’s namesake color stands out is on the bulkheads and in entryways where designers used the color to subtly guide passengers into the cabin.

“When you start working on an entirely new aircraft, you realize how many things you actually need to do from scratch just because the learnings are not there,” JetBlue director of product development Mariya Stoyanova told Skift on a walkthrough of the airline’s first A220-300 at New York JFK on Monday. “I don’t think we compromised on anything given the design of this aircraft.”

Amenities are the standard lot for JetBlue. They range from large personal inflight entertainment screens to power and USB ports at each seat, and free high-speed wi-fi.

But the big feature for travelers to look forward to is “space,” something that Stoyanova mentioned more than 10 times during the walkthrough. Space includes at least 32-inches of legroom — or “pitch” in airline parlance — in every row, which is at least an inch more than the industry standard. An 18.6-inch seat width that, according to Stoyanova, is more than on any other JetBlue plane. And even the overhead bins are spacious.

This space ethos is not new to JetBlue. The idea has been part of the airline’s DNA since it began flying in 2000 and continues to be part of its branding, for example the “Even More Space” extra-legroom seating option.

“We wanted to bring humanity back to air travel,” JetBlue founder David Neeleman told Guy Roz on the How I Built This podcast in 2019. The focus for him and his team at launch was to “treat people awesome,” which included offering more legroom and then-uncommon amenities like personal TV screens, and coupling them with superior customer service.

While no-longer the unique airline with personal TV screens, the space ethos continues to be part of JetBlue’s design decisions. For example on the A220, Stoyanova and her team were challenged with how to relocate emergency equipment from the overhead bins to the bulkheads in order to free up storage space for travelers. The solution was a curbed protrusion from the forward wall — dubbed “the backpack” — that met both their storage and aesthetic needs.

“We’d be like what do we do with the backpack? And everybody knew what we were talking about,” she said.

Passenger comfort was a big selling point for the A220 by its developer, the Canadian planemaker Bombardier. Born the CSeries, Airbus agreed to buy the program when it appeared a trade dispute by Boeing could result in onerous tariffs on any U.S.-bound jet. While the tariffs were ultimately rejected, the deal went through with Airbus rebranding it the A220 in July 2018.

Boston Debut

Flyers will get to put JetBlue’s A220 to the test in a few short months. The carrier will base the jet in Boston and plans to introduce it on regular flights to Fort Lauderdale by mid-June. However, the aircraft could sub in on other flights beginning this spring.

One benefit of the new plane is its ability to open longer, less popular routes in the future. While JetBlue has yet to name any such routes, examples include Air Canada’s plans to use its A220s to launch the first-ever nonstop flights between Toronto and San Jose, California, and Montreal and Seattle. Both routes were indefinitely postponed due to Covid-19.

The new aircraft will replace JetBlue’s smaller and less efficient Embraer E190s. The E-Jets seat 100 passengers whereas the A220s seat 140 passengers, resulting in what the carrier claims is a 30% per seat cost savings. The E190s are due to leave by the middle of the decade, if not sooner.

The A220 is not entirely immune from the crisis. Air Canada cancelled 12 orders due in coming years citing the crisis and lack of aid from the Canadian government. In 2020, Airbus data shows that it lost 28 A220 orders while its A320neo program gained 56 commitments.

And the 737 Max resumed flying in December ending the more than 20 month grounding. This return allowed carriers like Alaska Airlines to commit to more of the jets for their own fleet replacement.

Fleet renewal is seen as a major theme of the crisis on Wall Street. Cowen analyst Helane Becker expects U.S. airlines to remove up to 1,000 planes from their fleets with a “focus on simplicity and increased efficiency” as they retune their operations, she wrote in a report Monday.

In North America, Air Canada, Alaska, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have all unveiled sweeping fleet changes resulting from the pandemic. Notable for the A220 was Delta’s decision to retire its Boeing 717s as it shifts to the new generation jet.

Methodist AirCare: saving lives and delivering inspiration - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAxLW1ldGhvZGlzdC1haXJjYXJlLXNhdmluZy1saXZlcy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmluZy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Based in the U.S. state of Texas, Methodist AirCare proudly serves local communities in need of advanced emergency health care and rapid medical transport. The following profile highlights one of its recent missions with a very special patient.

Meet Bodhi, age 5. She spent 58 days looking out of her hospital window at Methodist Children’s Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. And the view she had from this room may very well have altered the course of her life forever.

Her room was on one of the hospital’s top floors, looking out onto the helipad, where Bodhi saw the yellow Methodist AirCare EC135 helicopter taking off and landing on a daily basis. One day, to her surprise and disappointment, she no longer saw the helicopter and asked one of her nurses what had happened to it.

The nurse told her that the helicopter was still flying, transporting patients and saving lives, but that it had simply gotten a new home base close by at the San Antonio Regional airport, from where it would fly either to local hospitals or to accident scenes to transport patients that needed its help.

Bodhi, a patient at Methodist Children’s Hospital in Texas, was inspired by the Methodist Air Care EC135 that she watched from her top-floor hospital room.

Jumping at the chance to help

“Bodhi and her nurses continued to chat when they asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she responded without missing a beat – a flight nurse,” explained Jose Flores, programme director for Methodist AirCare. “This immediately sparked something in the teams who then came to our flight crew and asked if we could help. We, of course, jumped at the chance.”

Methodist AirCare, a REACH Air Medical Services and Air Evac Lifeteam programme, has been flying their EC135 since 2009, providing life-saving air medical flights throughout San Antonio. Bronson Smith, a paediatric flight nurse with Methodist Children’s Hospital, called another member of the team, Stefanie Cruz, and asked if it would be possible to make something happen for a special patient. They immediately went into action, procuring a miniature flight suit and boots, and organising for Bodhi to become an honorary flight nurse of the Methodist AirCare team, and to take her very own first flight in the EC135.

“Right away I was drawn in and so intrigued,” said Cruz. “Bodhi's determination, resiliency, and ability to fight against all odds is really the equivalent of what it takes to become a successful crew member in the Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) industry, so I think this is why she has touched so many of our hearts.”

The community comes together for Bodhi

The entire community sprang into action to make Bodhi’s day possible. A neighbour of Stefanie’s donated the flight suit even though it had sentimental value for her family, as she knew it would bring a smile to Bodhi's face. Another neighbour volunteered her time to stitch the rainbow stripes on the suit. Stefanie’s daughter spent hours making the special beaded personalized bracelets. They also made her a custom teddy bear, which Bodhi named ""Heli,"" short for “helicopter.”

“I'm hoping that Bodhi and her family carry these memories with them forever,” Cruz added. “We are so lucky in our field to be able to help others, and if I can encourage just one young person to grow up and consider life as a HEMS provider then I know our industry will have a great future ahead. I hope we solidified Bodhi's career choice and that maybe when she is all grown up, I'll see her up in the friendly skies, doing the best job ever.”

An entire community came together to help deliver an unforgettable experience for Bodhi.

Going above and beyond

Air medical operations with helicopters began in the U.S. in the 1970s, with the Airbus Alouette starting off as the first air medical helicopter. Over the years, the technologies have advanced, the aircraft have changed, but the mission has remained the same: to save lives. More than 80% of all twin-engine helicopters delivered for air medical operations in North America since 2007 have been delivered by Airbus, which is proud to continue to play a role in supporting these missions that save lives when minutes matter most.

“This year has been such a challenge with the pandemic, being sheltered in place, and with friends and loved ones being sick, and that’s why for us it felt so natural to go above and beyond for Bodhi,” Flores said. “This has been an amazing experience for everyone involved. I hope this story inspires all in the HEMS industry to stay positive and hopeful with our hearts and skills we use every day in saving lives, as we will overcome the most unimaginable virus affecting millions of people.”"

In the first step of the conversion of the Bo.105, SPAES integrated a Garmin 500H TXi system. Therefore, the existing analog devices were removed, which creating new space and reducing weight. For primary navigation, the two GDU 700 flight displays were installed centrally in the pilots’ field of view in the instrument console.

To optimize the cockpit layout, a Garmin GTN 750 COM/ NAV/ GPS was integrated on the pilot side and a GTN 650 on the co-pilot side. Additionally, a Garmin GTX 345R transponder with ADS-B out and a GRA 55 radar altimeter were installed and approved.

All necessary digital and analog navigation and communication information are now centrally transmitted to the screens.

“Due to installing the systems from one manufacturer, all relevant information can be displayed centrally in the pilot’s field of view, and thereby we provide the crew with a modern and ergonomic cockpit. The integration of the Garmin systems into the Bo.105 has created an optimal workstation for our customer’s pilots,” said Joachim Schanz CEO of SPAES GmbH & Co. KG.

The certification of the G500H TXi was carried out via a Major Change with the German Federal Aviation Office at SPAES in their own design organization. System installation was carried out in the customer’s own Part 145 maintenance organization.

The other installed Garmin systems of the Bo.105 were approved by Minor Change also in the Part 21J Design Organization of SPAES."

JetBlue’s Thoughtfully Designed Cabin Interior to be Revealed Next Month

JetBlue announced it has formally taken delivery of its first Airbus A220-300 aircraft, marking the start of a new era for the airline’s fleet. The aircraft – tail N3008J – is scheduled to arrive at JetBlue’s home at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) this evening from Airbus’s U.S. production facility in Mobile, Ala. It is the first delivery of 70 A220 aircraft JetBlue has on order, which will be phased in to ultimately replace the existing fleet of 60 Embraer 190 aircraft.

“The A220 is a next-generation aircraft our customers and crewmembers will love, featuring impressive range and superior economics to support critical financial and operating priorities along with new network planning flexibility,” said Robin Hayes, chief executive officer, JetBlue. “And as we evolve our fleet for the future, the A220’s significant reduction in per-seat emissions supports our ongoing commitment to carbon neutrality for all our domestic flights, and moves us closer to achieving our pledge of net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040.”

The A220 boasts a nearly 30 percent lower direct operating cost per seat than the current E190. Lower seat costs come from both fuel and non-fuel savings. The A220 fleet will also help to further reset JetBlue’s maintenance costs well into the decade. The airline anticipates the A220 fleet, with improved reliability and longer maintenance intervals, will have a maintenance cost per seat that is more than 40 percent lower than E190s.

With a range of up to 3,350 nautical miles and a 40 percent lower fuel burn per seat than JetBlue’s E190 aircraft, the favourable economics open the door to new markets and routes that would have been unprofitable with JetBlue’s existing fleet. The A220 covers a wide mix of new and existing market possibilities with excellent economics on short, medium and even potentially transcontinental markets. This will allow for better overall aircraft utilisation and provide a competitive advantage for JetBlue in short-haul markets.

“JetBlue has revolutionized air travel, and we at Airbus are proud that our 20-year relationship has played a role in the airline’s many successes,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairman & CEO Airbus Americas, Inc. “This first A220-300 delivery creates new route possibilities for JetBlue, and raises their passenger experience to even higher standards.”

The A220 is powered exclusively by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, which deliver double-digit improvements in fuel and carbon emissions. Optimizing fuel burn is an important first step in JetBlue’s cost-conscious sustainability strategy, and prioritizing fuel-efficient aircraft and engines aligns with JetBlue’s approach to reducing emissions. Earlier this year, JetBlue became the first major U.S. airline to achieve carbon neutrality for all domestic flights, and later announced its plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040. The A220’s significant reduction in per-seat emissions will help JetBlue meet and maintain its sustainability commitments.

“This delivery marks another big milestone for JetBlue and Pratt & Whitney,” said Rick Deurloo, chief commercial officer and senior vice president at Pratt & Whitney. “We are honoured that JetBlue has operated Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft since the very beginning – and that JetBlue has selected GTF-powered aircraft for the airline’s next-generation fleets. We look forward to supporting JetBlue’s expansion and their commitment to sustainable aviation.”

The interior of JetBlue’s A220 will be as impressive as the operating capabilities of the aircraft. Customers will also enjoy an elevated inflight experience with wider seats, spacious overhead bins and extra-large windows. JetBlue’s fleet features the most legroom in coach (a) and free Fly-Fi®, the fastest broadband internet in the sky (b). JetBlue will reveal details of its custom-designed A220 cabin – featuring thoughtful, customer-friendly touches throughout – in January 2021.

JetBlue continues to navigate the new travel environment with a steady hand and a long-term view on recovery. The investment in the A220 allows the airline to continue to execute its low-cost business model and enables JetBlue to continue to offer low fares to more customers."

The Toulouse-based manufacturer reached a record-breaking production rate for the Airbus A320 family of 60 per month in 2019. In February 2020, when Airbus presented its FY2019 results, the company indicated that it had finalized work to ramp-up the rate to 63 per month by 2021. Not long before, the coronavirus crisis struck and Airbus, like many others, was forced to adapt to the current market situation.

Now, the planemaker looks to the future – and the future will once again bring back record-breaking production levels at various Final Assembly Lines (FAL) of Airbus’ supply chain.

Slowing down

In April 2020, Airbus announced that rates for the A320 family would go down from 60 to 40 per month for the time being. The company was looking to preserve “its ability to meet customer demand while protecting its ability to further adapt as the global market evolves,” was cited as the reason for the output cut.

Two months later, the situation had not improved, as Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Guillaume Faury stated that Airbus assumed that production levels seen in 2019 would not return by 2025.

The manufacturer coasted through 2020 with 40 Airbus A320 family aircraft per month, finishing the year off with a total of 556 deliveries, which included 446 narrow-body jets, excluding the A220.

Now, the manufacturer is looking to surf the recovery, in particular with the A320. According to a report by La Tribune, Airbus looks to produce as much as 47 A320s by July 2021. The ramp-up would continue throughout the next three years: by January 2022, the monthly output would reach 51 aircraft, six months later it would be at 57 per month, and by January 2023, Airbus would churn out 61 A320 family aircraft within a month.

While the outlook has recently improved due to the vaccination effort that has begun across the world, it was also slowed down due to new strains of the virus discovered in Brazil, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Thus, the planned ramp-up rates could once again shift, as Airbus monitors the situation across the globe.

Signs of eventual ramp-up

Despite the crisis that has ravaged air travel throughout the year, signs that Airbus was looking to ramp-up production were there.

The planemaker introduced its third BelugaXL aircraft into service in October 2020. The aircraft, which has been specifically built to carry various aircraft parts across Airbus’ assembly lines in China, Europe and North America, will replace the A300-based Beluga. Up to six BelugaXLs, which is based on the A330, will enter service by 2023.

In addition, the manufacturer will build a mega warehouse that will have 45,000 square meters of floor space, equivalent to six football (or soccer, for those who follow the wrong sport) fields in Hamburg, Germany, according to a report by Die Welt. Following the opening of the warehouse, which is scheduled for July 2021, Airbus will handle the storage and production logistics. Furthermore, the planemaker plans to independently control part supply for the A320 cabin equipment in Hamburg.

The Hamburg FAL previously struggled to deliver aircraft on time, as the Airbus Cabin Flex (ACF) option, which allows for more individual cabin configuration, hit production issues. Disappointment followed – so much so, that International Airlines Group (IAG) (IAG) signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with Boeing for 200 737 MAX aircraft in July 2019. Willie Walsh, the now-retired IAG chief executive, indicated that A320neo aircraft were delivered up to 70 days late on average, which prompted the airline group to look across the Atlantic for other options.

“This should be an indication not just to Airbus but to everybody that we’re unhappy with their performance. I know everybody interprets it as an issue of price, it’s not,” Walsh stated at the time.

Nevertheless, the new warehouse in Germany’s north would allow Airbus to control the production with “foresight,” Sebastian Peters, head of Logistics and Industrial Planning at the manufacturer, told Die Welt. “If a part comes later or there is a quality problem, we can intervene at the right time,” Peters added.

Supporting backlog?

By a long stretch, the A320 is Airbus most popular product. Similar to the competing Boeing 737 MAX, the narrow-body segment has always remained in high-demand. But has that demand remained robust enough to warrant a hike in production rates?

The European planemaker indicated in its 2020 Orders and Deliveries release that it received 268 net orders after 115 aircraft were removed from the backlog due to cancellations. Airbus reduced its A320 backlog by 33 aircraft, namely 22 A320neos and 11 A321neos, as customers backed away or minimized their orders. Despite the fact, the order book increased by 75 and 141 units, respectively. According to the Orders and Deliveries data as of December 30, 2020, Airbus had a backlog of 5,885 aircraft of the A320 family.

The backlog is no doubt in a healthier state compared to the 737 MAX, which saw its backlog shrink by around 1,000 aircraft compared to the end of 2019.

However, some of the airlines might not see the light of the day or be able to take up the ordered aircraft. While only a handful of airlines have been liquidated throughout the downturn in travel, a balloon of debt hangs over the numerous parked aircraft.

”Debt has gone up more than 50%. Airlines have to generate positive cash to pay that down. $220 billion of extra debt is going to take years to repay,” International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s chief economist Brian Pearce stated in November 2020. Pearce added that the ever-increasing debt levels would result in fewer resources to invest in new aircraft, slowing down expansion and fleet renewal plans.

At the same time, the robust demand for narrow-body aircraft is predicted to remain, as domestic and regional aviation is better positioned to weather such crises as the current COVID-19-induced one. International travel has suffered the most due to the unpredictable nature of borders being either open or closed.

“Operators are projected to need 32,270 new airplanes in the next 20 years. Single-aisle demand will recover sooner due to its key role in short-haul routes and domestic markets as well as passenger preference for point-to-point service,” concluded Boeing in its most recent 20-year market outlook, published in October 2020."

Just after landing at Bogota Airport, however, the aircraft got hit by some sort of pyrotechnic balloon. The pilots were able to continue roll-out.

It was not immediately clear whether the balloon was carrying any actual fireworks, but it did turn out to be packed with tinsel. Long strings of colorful plastic got wrapped around the aircraft’s tail, and some apparently got into one of its engines.

Looking at the residue that left behind on the aircraft, the result could have been worse.

The Colombian aviation authorities urged people to be extra cautious during this holiday period and to abstain from using fireworks or launching hot air balloons close to airports.

Airbus wins the 2020 aircraft delivery stakes hands down - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy13aW5zLTIwMjAtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVsaXZlcnktc3Rha2VzLWhhbmRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A more resilient Airbus creamed its troubled US rival when it came to commercial aircraft deliveries in 2020 as Boeing delivered its lowest number of planes in almost half a century.

The impact on aviation of the COVID-19 pandemic was compounded for Boeing by the ongoing grounding of the 737 MAX and manufacturing problems later in the year with its widebody 787 Dreamliner.

Boeing’s woes meant the US company delivered just 157 commercial aircraft compared to 566 at Airbus.

Not weighed down by problems with its single-aisle aircraft, Airbus delivered 446 members of the A320 family, the majority of them neos. Also delivered: 38 A220s, 19 A330s, 59 A350s and four A380s.

However, the Europeans did not escape the ravages of the pandemic and deliveries were down 34 percent from 863 in 2019. Net orders also plummeted from 768 in 2019 to 268 in 2020.

But it won 383 new orders during the year, including 296 A320 Family orders, 37 of which were for A321XLRs. In the widebody segment, Airbus won 23 new orders including two A330s and 21 A350s

Cancelations saw the European planemaker’s backlog fall from 7,482 to 7148.

Airbus said it overcame travel restrictions with an innovative e-delivery solution which represented more than 25 percent of the 2020 deliveries.

This allowed customers to receive their aircraft while minimizing the need for their teams to travel.

“Based on our 2020 deliveries we are cautiously optimistic as we look into 2021, although challenges and uncertainties remain high in the short term,” Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said.

Boeing’s 2020 figures were badly hit by the 737 Max woes and it delivered just 43 737s during the year as it watched customers cancel 641 orders.

The Max resumed deliveries in December and Boeing had delivered 31 by year’s end.

Other deliveries comprised five 747s, 30 767s, 26 777s and 53 787s.

“The resumption of 737 MAX deliveries in December was a key milestone as we strengthen safety and quality across our enterprise,’’ Boeing chief financial officer Greg Smith said.

“ We also continued comprehensive inspections of our 787 airplanes to ensure they meet our highest quality standards prior to delivery.

“While limiting our 787 deliveries for the quarter, these comprehensive inspections represent our focus on safety, quality and transparency, and we’re confident that we’re taking the right steps for our customers and for the long-term health of the 787 program.”

Smith said the manufacturer was working closely with customers and monitoring the slow international traffic recovery in 2021 “to align supply with market demand across our widebody programs”

“In 2021, we’ll continue taking the right actions to enhance our safety culture, preserve liquidity and transform our business for the future,’’ he added."

"What is China’s home-grown C919 aeroplane, and why is it important? - South China Morning Post","Fri, 01 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvY2hpbmEtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMTU3OTMvYzkxOS13aGF0LWNoaW5hcy1ob21lLWdyb3duLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZHVvcG9sedIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvY2hpbmEtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMTU3OTMvYzkxOS13aGF0LWNoaW5hcy1ob21lLWdyb3duLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZHVvcG9seQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nearly one-third are from Europe, while there are 14 Chinese suppliers, with seven of those being joint ventures with foreign firms.

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus, Washington think tank finds

China’s C919 commercial jet aspirations are overblown and no threat to Boeing or Airbus, Washington think tank finds

According to a report published in December 2020 by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers.

However, most of the parts are imported from foreign manufacturers, including the engine, avionics, control systems, communications and landing gear.

The Chinese government formed Comac in 2008 to design and build the single-aisle C919.

The C919 is a narrow-body jet being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a state-owned company based in Shanghai, to compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320.

Among the foreign suppliers, the US’ General Electric and France’s Safran provide the engine; American firm Honeywell makes the flight-control system; and US-based Rockwell Collins produces the communication and navigation systems.

General Electric also formed a joint venture with the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) in 2012 to focus on avionics development for the C919.

Why is the C919 important to China?

China is among the world’s fastest-growing civil-aviation markets, and the C919 is the nation’s ambitious attempt to manufacture its first commercial jetliner to meet its own rising demand.

The success of the project would be economically beneficial for China, as it could break the country’s dependence on the duopoly currently enjoyed by Boeing and Airbus, and has the potential to catapult Comac into the multibillion-dollar aviation industry.

The C919’s development also coincides with China’s objective of cutting its reliance on foreign technology and increasing investment to achieve indigenous innovation.

The plane’s development was an integral element of the “Made in China 2025” plan, a road map from 2018 that Beijing hoped would help lift its hi-tech industries to international levels.

Made in China 2025 has since been officially downplayed by Beijing due to pressure from its key trading partners, including the US and the European Union, but China is still aiming to increase its reliance on domestic production for key components, including computer chips and controlling systems.

The C919 was also mentioned by President Xi Jinping in his report at the 19th National Congress in 2017, along with the nation’s other scientific achievements, as drivers of China’s “new model of development”.

How does the US-China relationship impact the development of the C919?

While China has been among the biggest buyers of US aviation products, its state-driven investment in aviation, which has included buying US aerospace companies, has set off alarm bells in Washington.

Beijing’s national strategy of “military-civil fusion”, a policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development, is also a concern for the US.

commissioned a report to look into how the Chinese government was growing its aviation manufacturing business and the resulting military implications. In 2017, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission – which advises the US Congress –

According to a report published in December 2020 by a Washington-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), American companies make up almost three-fifths of the C919’s primary suppliers. Photo: Twitter

The report, compiled by the Rand Corporation, found that China’s total investment in US aerospace companies over the past decade was relatively small and involved low-end technology.

There were some concerns over technology transfers through joint ventures connected with the C919 project, but the report also cited experts saying that the risk was low because of US export-control restrictions.

Aerospace products are valuable exports for the US economy and integral to its national security. Many aviation products fall under US export-controls restrictions, including the CFM International LEAP, or Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion, engine produced in a joint venture between General Electric and Safran that is used on the C919.

China’s investment in US aviation companies is also subject to review and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is an inter-agency group of the US government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in US companies or operations.

But as relations between Beijing and Washington have soured, the US government has tightened its regulations over the sales of aviation products to China, potentially adding hurdles to the development of the C919.

In December 2020, the US Department of Commerce released a list of “military end users” , covering aerospace companies from China and Russia that had military ties, meaning they will be restricted from buying a wide range of US components and technology.

While Comac is not on the list, seven entities related to AVIC, which holds a minority share of Comac, were included.

On January 14, 2021, the US Department of Defence added nine Chinese companies, including Comac, to its list of ""Communist Chinese military companies"".

Under an earlier executive order signed last year by then president Donald Trump, American investors were prohibited from certain transactions in securities related to certain listed companies. Comac is not a publicly traded company, but it has sold bonds in the Chinese securities market.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it is “determined to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernisation goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities”.

Earlier in 2020, the US government was weighing whether to deny General Electric’s request to provide the LEAP engines for the C919. It eventually approved the licence for the jet-engine sales after President Donald Trump said the US should not prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China.

What is the outlook for the C919?

The C919 made its maiden test flight in 2017, but has yet to be certified.

Its chief designer, Wu Guanghui, told Chinese media in November 2020 that the narrow-body jetliner was aiming to receive a type certification by the end of 2021 after the airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), authorised the C919 to begin the testing process.

The C919 began undergoing cold-weather test flights in December 2020, in the far northern city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia. The plane was also reportedly being tested in other parts of China, and mainland media outlets have reported that deliveries of the jet will begin in late 2021, as scheduled.

Comac said airlines and aircraft-leasing firms have placed orders for 1,065 C919s, with the vast majority of demand coming from Chinese carriers.

Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages, and hence, it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight Scott Kennedy

However, some analysts believe it will take some time before the C919 receives certification from the CAAC, and even longer to receive certification by US and European aviation regulators before China is able to sell the C919 in these large foreign markets.

“Comac has consistently over-promised on its ability to get through each of these stages, and hence, it is not worth speculating how many more years remain before the first paying customers find their seat for a regular commercial flight,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior CSIS adviser who is responsible for research into Comac.

Kennedy estimated in December 2020 that Comac had already received between US$49 billion and US$72.1 billion from the Chinese government for the C919.

And it appears unlikely that China will stop channelling state money into the C919.

In 2016, Beijing set up the Aero Engine Corporation of China to build an indigenous engine for the C919, the CJ-1000AX, in the hope that it could eventually replace the LEAP engine produced by General Electric and Safran.

Under Xi’s so-called dual-circulation strategy, which focuses on home-grown innovation to counter external hostility, China is accelerating its technology development and investment.

Liu Daxiang, deputy director of the science and technology committee at AVIC, said in December 2020 that producing a jet engine was an urgent political task, but conceded that its production would take a long time because China lacks research, experience and data."

On January 25, 2021, Frontier Airlines announced having chosen the US engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney to provide GTF engines to power a total of 134 Airbus A320neo family aircraft. According to the latest company release, GFT engines will power 49 A320neos, 67 A321neos, and 18 A321XLR jets. The airline is set to receive delivery of the first Airbus A320neo family aircraft in 2022.

In addition, the airline and Pratt & Whitney stepped into a long-term agreement partnership, which includes engine maintenance services. Frontier Airlines plans to operate their GTF-powered A320neo family jets on domestic and international routes in North America.

“Frontier Airlines is at the forefront of green innovation in the airline industry and this deal for advanced GTF engines from Pratt & Whitney is extremely significant in our continued action plan to reduce fuel consumption,” said Barry Biffle, the President, and CEO of Frontier Airlines.

The CEO of Frontier hopes that the new engine technology will help the airline save fuel and reduce its operational costs, which the carrier plans to “pass on to consumers in the form of low fares.”

“It is with immense pride and excitement that we welcome Frontier Airlines to the Pratt & Whitney family,” quoted Rick Deurloo, the Chief Commercial Officer at Pratt & Whitney.

“With the GTF engine, Frontier will be getting more than fuel efficiency and environmental responsibility; Pratt & Whitney will be with Frontier every step of the way, supporting their operations for decades to come,” Deurloo added.

According to Pratt & Whitney, the GTF engine is capable of reducing fuel consumption by 16%, while reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 50% in comparison to the regulatory standard.

Release Date January 14, 2021 Alaska maps its 2020s with Boeing and leaves Virgin strategy behind Purchase a PDF of this article

When Alaska Air Group took delivery of the very first A321neo for Virgin America in April 2017, the milestone was marked by silence from the airline. Airbus’s only mention of Alaska Airlines’ parent company in its own announcement was in the final sentence , noting Virgin had been acquired four months earlier.

In announcing its deal on Dec. 22 that will significantly expand its commitment for Boeing 737 Max 9s to 68 aircraft, the airline largely closes the book on its merger Virgin America. With the incoming new aircraft, Alaska will exit 61 Airbus single-aisles (51 A320s and 10 A319s) by summer 2023.

Boeing, whose ties with the airline have only deepened since merger with Virgin, backed Alaska’s bid for the airline in 2016. Likewise Airbus for JetBlue Airways own run at Virgin. On both sides of the deal, there was an urgency from Boeing’s perspective to not allow the fifth largest U.S. airline to be a mostly Airbus operator — as it would’ve been if JetBlue had been victorious in its own pursuit.

“I think very little” of the original Virgin merger strategy remains at Alaska, said Nat Pieper, Alaska Airlines senior vice president of fleet, treasury and alliances in a recent interview with The Air Current. Walking away from its A320 family fleet was “not preordained,” he said. However, the deal does leave behind the fleet and California-centric strategy plotted with the Virgin acquisition and reaches a long-expected equilibrium as it moves to consolidate its aircraft back toward Boeing."
