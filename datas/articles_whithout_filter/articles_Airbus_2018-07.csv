Airbus's new BelugaXL completes maiden flight - USA TODAY,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTgvMDcvMTkvYWlyYnVzcy1uZXctYmVsdWdhLXhsLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0LzgwMjc4NzAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World's strangest-looking airplane? New Airbus 'Beluga' takes flight

Airbus completed the maiden flight of its massive new BelugaXL transport aircraft on Thursday, debuting the plane in front of a crowd of more than 10,000 near the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Airbus’s oddly shaped jet – named for its resemblance to the whale of the same name – is the first of five that Airbus expects to build by 2023. The jets will be used to phase out the existing BelugaST models that the company uses to shuttle large aircraft pieces to its assembly centers.

The first flight of the new AirbusXL took off from the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France at 2:24 p.m. local time, flying for 4 hours and 11 minutes before returning to land at the same airport.

Next up for the plane is a 10-months of flight testing that should lead to the BelugaXL’s certification. If all goes as planned, Airbus hopes to put the first BelugaXL into service sometime next year.

The BelugaST that the ""XL"" will replace is technically the Airbus A300-600ST, a heavily modified version of Airbus’ now-discontinued A300 model. It initially was called the Super Transporter in the 1990s when it began to phase out an earlier transport model dubbed the ""Super Guppy."" Eventually the A300-600ST took on the name of the whale many say it resembles.

ARCHIVES: World's strangest-looking airplane? A closer look Airbus's current model: the Airbus 'BelugaST'

The plane is used by European jetmaker Airbus to ferry aircraft and extra-large cargo. It's especially useful for the company in moving large plane parts from its production facilities to its assembly lines.

The BelugaST is capable of holding the wings of an A340 widebody. It also is capable of transporting the fuselage section of Airbus' newest widebody jet, the A350. Such oversized parts would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, to fit into typical transport aircraft.

Airbus created its supersize BelugaST by cutting the top section off one of its Airbus A300 widebody jet models and then adding a bubble-shaped additional fuselage to the airframe. The A300 is no longer in production, something that helped lead to the even-bigger BelugaXL.

The new XL was developed by making similar modifications to Airbus’ current A330-200 freighter widebody.

Once it's certified, the XL will begin to take over missions now performed with the ST. Airbus says the transport aircraft will operate from 11 destinations as the company’s method of transporting large aircraft components to assembly centers.

Boeing, of course, has its own special transport plane for flying oversized items. Boeing's is a modified 747, which was designed largely to transport pieces of the Dreamliner — which explains the ""Dreamlifter"" name that Boeing gave to its equivalent of Beluga.

Airbus and Boeing are tightening their hold on the sky - The Economist,"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZ3VsbGl2ZXIvMjAxOC8wNy8xMC9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1hcmUtdGlnaHRlbmluZy10aGVpci1ob2xkLW9uLXRoZS1za3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By C.R.

AT A glitzy party in Toulouse on July 10th Airbus, Europe’s aerospace giant, revealed its “newest” plane. But many aviation buffs might find it familiar. It was a repainted C-Series aircraft—originally developed by Bombardier of Canada—a project in which Airbus bought a 50.01% stake on July 1st. Airbus welcomed the aircraft into its family of planes by renaming the CS-100 as the A220-100 and the CS-300 as the A220-300. The message was clear: it is now an Airbus plane. But with Airbus and Bombardier’s arch rivals, Boeing of America and Embraer of Brazil, announcing their own joint venture last week, the skies are running out of competition.

The tie-up between Airbus and Bombardier, originally signed last October, initially came as good news for many airlines. Before Airbus swooped, the C-Series project was financially on its knees following an attempt by Boeing, Airbus’s arch-rival, to get tariffs slapped on imports of the planes into America. That would have decimated its order book and pushed Bombardier to the brink of bankruptcy. By allowing the C-Series aircraft ordered by airlines in America to be built at its Alabama factory, Airbus stopped Boeing from killing the programme off before it got off the ground. Only 38 of the jets are yet in service but Eric Schulz, Airbus’s chief salesman, has grand plans. He now hopes to sell 6,100 of the jets over the next twenty years—a figure derided by veteran aerospace journalists as “wildly optimistic”.

Even so, Boeing has sniffed a threat to the short-haul family of planes it makes called the 737. And so it responded to the Airbus-Bombardier coupling last week by announcing its own: a joint venture with Embraer of Brazil, a maker of smaller civil jets that makes aircraft with between 100-150 seats in competition with Bombardier.

But with Bombardier now firmly in Airbus’s camp, and Embraer lined up with Boeing, the two giants now almost rule the entire sky, at least as far as large civil aircraft are concerned. Other new aircraft projects around the world have flown into turbulence and are not serious competition. Long-standing worries about air safety in Russia have meant that the Sukhoi Superjet 100, a small airliner made in that country, has sold to relatively few Western airlines. China has tried to enter the market for airliners with the ARJ-21, a regional jet, and the C919, an aircraft that looks remarkably similar to Airbus’s short-haul aircraft. But apart from a few sales to some local carriers subject to some patriotic arm-twisting from Beijing, there have hardly been any sales as they are not as fuel efficient as Airbus and Boeing’s latest planes. Mitsubishi, a Japanese engineering giant, is also building a new regional jet, but the programme is running very late and is much smaller than anything Airbus or Boeing produces.

So will passengers be doomed to fly either Airbus or Boeing’s planes forever more? Hold your horses: Boeing’s tie-up with Embraer is not a done deal yet. Many investors in the Brazilian planemaker are unhappy that they will only get 20% of the joint-venture with Boeing if it goes through. The front-runner in a presidential election due in October has promised to veto the deal on national-security grounds. Mr Schulz himself is sceptical that Boeing’s 737 airliner fits together with Embraer’s E2 jets as well as Bombardier’s C-Series does with Airbus’s A320 family of aircraft. For instance, the C-Series and the A320 uses similar engines; the E2 and the 737 do not. As one executive at Embraer told Gulliver at last November’s Dubai Air Show, “a tie-up would do much for Boeing—but little for us or ordinary passengers”."
Airbus forecasts $4.6 trillion worldwide market for commercial aircraft services over the next 20 years - Airbus,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNy1haXJidXMtZm9yZWNhc3RzLTQ2LXRyaWxsaW9uLXdvcmxkd2lkZS1tYXJrZXQtZm9yLWNvbW1lcmNpYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ambitions to boost value to customers and reach $10bn of services revenues in commercial in the next decade

Airbus’ new Global Services Forecast predicts a US$4.6 trillion worldwide market for commercial aircraft services from 2018 to 2037. The new analysis is based on a three-way market segmentation, respectively focusing on the aircraft, the airline operation, and the passenger experience.

Aircraft-focused lifecycle services represent the largest segment of growth and include maintenance, spares pool access, tooling, technical training and system upgrades – which are needed to keep the airlines aircraft flying. This market represents a cumulative value of $2.2 trillion over the 20-year period – from $76 billion in 2018 to more than $160 billion per annum by 2037. These services are provided throughout the lifecycle from design to dismantling. In this category, aircraft manufacturers provide customers with core services which come with the aircraft, including assigned field reps and call centres for AOGs for example. The largest market by value is maintenance, increasingly characterised by outsourcing and “paid-by-the-hour” (PBH) contracts. Moreover, as technology and new materials develop, such as composite repairs, Airbus sees a strong trend for further outsourcing. PBH contracts allow airlines to secure and predict their maintenance costs, allowing airlines to focus on their core business of flying. Airbus also sees airlines increase their outsourcing of inventory management – towards pooling, instead of investing in their own stocks.

The next largest category encompasses flight operations services – such as pilot training and flight-planning solutions – and will account for a $1.5 trillion cumulative spend over 20 years. Fleets are expected to more than double to 48,000 aircraft over this period, such that Airbus estimates a need for 540,000 new pilots in the next 20 years. This trend will require ‘smarter’ ways of training using new digital technologies.

The third component of the global services market centres on the passenger experience which will account for an estimated $0.9 trillion cumulative value over the 20 year period. This encompasses the services needed to optimise the flight experience, including cabin upgrades, cabin crew training, in-flight-entertainment, connectivity and booking. This segment is expected to more than double in the next 20 years and grow from $27bn to almost $70bn. A notable trend is that seamless connectivity will undergo exponential growth, as more and more passengers manage their travel using a smart device, providing them all the information in real-time about the airport, connecting flights, bag collection details etc.

Airbus’ ambition in Services – $10bn in revenues and boosting customer value

After an 18 percent annual growth in its services revenues for the past two years, Airbus’ ambition is to triple its services revenues from more than $3.2bn in 2017 to reach $10bn of services revenues in commercial in the next decade. To attain this goal, Airbus will continue to develop full lifecycle integrated services for all Airbus’ aircraft operators. Furthermore, these integrated services – such as Flight Hour Services (FHS) – will be even more efficient through the Skywise open data platform.

Airbus will also expand its current service portfolio to non-Airbus platforms, given that 62 percent of Airbus’ total fleet is operated by ‘multi-fleet’ operators. An example of this happening today is illustrated by Airbus’ materials management subsidiary Satair, which already has 25 percent of its revenues coming from non-Airbus parts; while the Navblue flight operations subsidiary also delivers multi-fleet services. Furthermore, Airbus will extend services to a wider customer base – such as airports and air traffic control operations. Lastly, Airbus will reinforce its strategic position in the value chain. Another visible facet of Airbus’ growth in its services is the increasingly local presence, ie. being closer to its customers. Airbus’ developing global services footprint now spans 65 locations globally including 17 training centres.

One common denominator, across all the services which Airbus will increasingly cultivate is ‘digitalisation’, with many solutions being interconnected and integrated. These solutions will create additional value for airlines, lessors and MRO companies, for instance by allowing real-time decision-making, or by optimising flight and maintenance operations through analytics.

Airbus A220? Bombardier's CSeries gets a new name - USA TODAY,"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE4LzA3LzEwL2FpcmJ1cy0yMjAteXVwLXRoYXRzLW5ldy1uYW1lLWJvbWJhcmRpZXJzLWNzZXJpZXMvNzcxMTAxMDAyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Say 'so long' to Bombardier’s CSeries jets; they're now 'Airbus A220s'

Say “so long” to Bombardier’s CSeries jets. No, the jet isn’t being scrapped, but it is taking on a new name as Airbus cements its new majority stake in the product line.

Airbus is extending its naming convention to the jets, rebranding the CSeries as the Airbus A220. The smaller CS100, which can seat about 120 passengers in a typical configuration, will now be called the A220-100. The larger CS300 that can seat 130 to 140 passengers in a standard layout will be known as the A220-300.

Airbus’ new ""A220"" designation places its new line of smaller jets from Bombardier below Airbus' existing ""A300"" lineup of jets. That lineup currently ranges from the A320 family of single-aisle planes that start at about 125 seats up to Airbus' double-decked A380 superjumbo jet that can seat more than 600 passengers in “high-density” configurations.

In a statement announcing the name aircraft names, Airbus said that A220 aircraft “are fully optimized for the 100 to 150 seat market and perfectly complement Airbus’ existing … A320neo family.”

“Everyone at Airbus has been looking forward to this historic moment. Today, we are thrilled to welcome the A220 to the Airbus family and are honored to see it wearing its new Airbus colors for the first time,” Guillaume Faury, Airbus President Commercial Aircraft, said in a statement. “I pay tribute to all the women and men at Bombardier and the supply chain who have strived over the past years to bring this fantastic aircraft to the world. The A220 now enters a new phase in its career with all Airbus’ resources behind it to further its commercial success worldwide.”

Airbus and Bombardier first announced their tie-up last October as Canadian jetmaker Bombardier looked for a resolution to a trade dispute in which the United States threatened tariffs of up to 300% on the CSeries jets. The threatened tariffs followed a formal complaint launched by Boeing that alleged unfair subsidies for the Canadian-made jet, which was buoyed by a large order from Atlanta-based Delta.

The United States ultimately confirmed unfair subsidies, but backed off the tariffs because it said Boeing could not prove harm from them. However, that didn’t come before Bombardier sought refuge in a deal with Boeing's archrival Airbus that would allow U.S.-bound CSeries jets to be assembled at Airbus’ recently opened assembly line in Alabama. The deal ended up giving Airbus a majority stake in the CSeries line.

Since then, Boeing has followed up plans to cement its own partnership with Bombardier’s Brazilian-based rival Embraer, further extending the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus.

Bombardier and Embraer have traditionally focused mostly on regional jets, but each has introduced new lines of planes that can seat roughly 100 to 150 passengers, depending on the model and configuration. That new lineup of planes has brought the regional jetmaker’s planes right up to the cusp of the smallest models offered by Boeing (the 737) and Airbus (the A320 family).

Now, the recent deals have brought Boeing and Airbus – the world’s two largest jetmakers – squarely into the picture. Until the recent deals, Boeing and Airbus had focused most of their passenger aircraft attention on larger “mainline” aircraft and left the smaller planes to other manufacturers.

"Thanks to inflation, Airbus takes major financial hit, again, on largest military program - Defense News","Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L3RoYW5rcy10by1pbmZsYXRpb24tYWlyYnVzLXRha2VzLW1ham9yLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1oaXQtYWdhaW4tb24tbGFyZ2VzdC1taWxpdGFyeS1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus took a further financial hit on the A400M military airlifter program, booking €98 million (U.S. $115 million) of provisions in results for teh first half the year.

The hit mainly stems from price escalation, the company said in a statement on the first-half results, reported July 26. For the A400M, Airbus saw price increases in labor and equipment above those agreed in the production contract. Those provisions add to previous provisions totaling €7.2 billion — all thank to this reality, stated by Sash Tusa, an analyst with an equity research firm, Agency Partners: “Costs in the aeronautical industry escalate, but Airbus has not been able to reclaim these under the current situation.

In the U.S. there are producer price indices for the aeronautics sector, but the A400M reflects price increases in the euro zone. Airbus carries a heavy burden of financial risk under the present contract, even as the company adds capabilities to the aircraft and continues talks with the core seven client nations for easing the production contract.

""On our largest military program, the A400M, we are making progress operationally, on improving capabilities as well as in negotiations with governments for the necessary contract amendment,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement with the results. Airbus expects to an agreement on the contract by the end of the year, the company said.

There were “encouraging prospects for European military cooperation programs in military aircraft and unmanned aerial systems,” while the Airbus Defense and Space division saw strong orders, particularly for space systems, the company said.

Airbus has signed a partnership agreement with Dassault Aviation to cooperate on a Franco-German project for a Future Combat Air System, which is expected to include a new fighter, spy plane and air tanker. Other elements include swarms of drones and cruise missiles."
What are the prospects for the Airbus A220? - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8wNy8xMS93aGF0LWFyZS10aGUtcHJvc3BlY3RzLWZvci10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

July 11, 2018, © Leeham News.: With the CSeries repainted and rebranded in Airbus colors, will this change its fortunes? The aircraft has been on the market for 10 years and has not been a home run in term of sales.

We look at how the A220 fits in the Airbus lineup and the sales plan the Airbus leaders say they have for the aircraft.

The A220’s place in the Airbus family

In the presentations preceding the A220-300’s over-flight, the leadership of the Airbus-dominated A220 joint venture (CSALP, C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership) revealed how they see the A220-100 and A220-300 fit in the extended Airbus family.

The A220-300, aka CS300, is the network feeder, Figure 1. The A220-100 (CS100) is a step-up regional aircraft and a route opener.

The A319 is kept in the lineup, now positioned as a special performance aircraft with long range and good hot/high airport performance.

Above the A319 the positioning is clear. The A320neo is a hot seller and it’s 40 seats larger than an equally configured A220-300.

Airbus also claims the A220 shares the A320 DNA with 18-inch-wide seats in economy and the Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, making it quiet for take-off and landings.

Airbus then showed a slide how the Airbus aircraft differ in seating and range and how its lineup is superior to Embraer’s E190-E2 and E195-E2 in range, Figure 2.

As we will show in subsequent articles, this is a case of comparing Apples with Oranges.

Sales prospects

Airbus sales management said they expect 3,000 A220 to be sold over a 20-year period and sales this year would be high two digits. Later in the day, a JetBlue order for 60 A220 with a further 60 as options was announced.

This was, of course, no coincidence. The events were closely timed, to give the new A220 series a kick-start as an Airbus aircraft.

It will be interesting to see if this was the only order Bombardier/Airbus stocked for the launch or if we can expect more announcements at next week’s Farnborough Air Show.

The Bombardier C Series is no more.

On Tuesday, the Canadian airliner was officially renamed the Airbus A220 in a ceremony at the European airplane maker's headquarters in Toulouse, France.

""Everyone at Airbus has been looking forward to this historic moment,"" Guillaume Faury, the president of Airbus' commercial-aircraft division, said in a statement. ""Today, we are thrilled to welcome the A220 to the Airbus family and are honored to see it wearing its new Airbus colors for the first time.""

Faury also praised the hard work put in by employees of Bombardier, based in Quebec, to bring the 100-to-150-seat A220 to market.

The A220 will continue to be available in two variants: The CS100 is now the A220-100, while the larger CS300 is now the A220-300.

This is the second time the aircraft has been renamed. Before the CS100 and CS300 designations, the planes were known as the CS110 and the CS130.

Earlier this month, Airbus completed a deal to acquire 50.1% of the financially challenged C Series program, with Bombardier and the Quebec government remaining minority shareholders. Airbus made no up-front financial investment in the C Series but will provide its procurement, marketing, sales, and customer-support expertise.

Airbus also indicated that A220 production would take place at its plant in Mobile, Alabama.

When the deal was announced in October, Bombardier was mired in a trade dispute with Boeing and under threat from a proposed 299.45% tariff by the US Commerce Department.

The dispute came about when Boeing alleged that its business was hurt by Delta Air Lines' 2016 order for 75 C Series jets because the planes' unfairly low prices were possible only with the assistance of Canadian government subsidies.

Airbus

In January, the US International Trade Commission struck the down the proposed tariff, ending the dispute.

The A220 moniker allows Airbus to market the C Series with a name that's in line with the rest of its lineup.

The renaming of an airliner is far from a common occurrence, but it has happened before. Following Boeing's 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, the MD-95 became the Boeing 717-200.

The Airbus A220 is in operation with Swiss International Air Lines, airBaltic, and Korean Air."

Share

APEX Insight: This morning, Airbus announced that the C Series program will now be known as the A220. APEX Media was at Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse to find out if the rebrand could bring more than just a change of name.

Airbus today unveiled new branding and a new name for the C Series at an event at its Toulouse headquarters, following its acquisition of a majority stake in the program earlier this month. From now on, the C Series narrow-body jets will be branded as the Airbus A220. But besides the new name, is anything else changing and will passengers notice a difference?

“In terms of passenger experience it is going to be seamless. The C Series is already exceptional,” – Christine De Gagne, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft.

Christine De Gagne, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft’s manger of Cabin Marketing made it clear that, at least to start with, the passenger experience probably won’t change. “In terms of passenger experience it is going to be seamless. The C Series is already exceptional,” she told APEX Media.

The aircraft already delivers more than one window at each row, seats with at least 18 inches of width and overhead bins with the largest stowage capacity in their class. Still, even as the aircraft keeps true to its roots, De Gagne hinted at some alignment with the Airspace by Airbus branding that will help bring the newest member of the Airbus family more tightly into the fold.

“When you’re in a family you share a common character and similar traits,” – Christine De Gagne, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft.

The initial push for the A220 product line is to cut costs and improve production rates, steps necessary to bring stability and future sales. Some of the passenger touchpoints could see adjustments as a result. As De Gagne explains, “When you’re in a family you share a common character and similar traits. It is in our plan to look into Airspace and to make the cabin a true family fit.”

Some of that commonality exists today. De Gagne highlights the similarly wide seats, higher window per row count and lighting options as a few areas where the C Series shares similarities with other Airbus aircraft. Indeed, she suggested that the C Series could easily be mistaken for a “baby A350” in some ways, and that airlines and passengers already realize the benefits of the aircraft. “The crew really noticed that their passengers are much calmer. When your seat is wider you can move. You’re not stuck, you’re not compressed, you’re not stressed,” De Gagne said.

In the longer term, De Gagne said the A220 will be increasingly aligned with the Airspace family through cabin design.

“There will be a common design language. We want something that feels seamless and you want to bring some character to the cabin design and signature items such as the bin latch. We’ll try to target little pieces that will remind passengers or the airline that C Series is the little brother of the A320 family but also fits in the overall family because Airspace covers the whole [Airbus product line].”"

· New Skywise applications already demonstrating value for partners in strategic areas: on-time deliveries; quality and aircraft reliability;

· Providing suppliers with the unprecedented power to analyse their data.

Building on the successful launch of the Skywise open data platform for airlines at the Paris Air Show in 2017, Airbus is now extending the scope of cloud-based big-data analytics into the supply chain. The new offering will connect selected suppliers to the Skywise platform, to enable unprecedented improvements in their reliability, quality, and performance and, more generally, transform aviation through better performance. This is the first time that Airbus and suppliers are co-innovating with data sharing and analytics during an early adopter phase.



Marc Fontaine, Airbus’ Digital Transformation Officer said: “I’m very pleased to announce the next stage of uniting the aviation industry’s data, by connecting suppliers to the Skywise platform. The scope and power of data integration technology, which only became available recently, is now bringing productivity gains which benefit all stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem – from suppliers and airlines to OEMs. When our aircraft are reliable and flying passengers, we are all better off.”

‘Early adopter’ phase demonstrates power of the platform

Since late last year, Airbus has been working with selected suppliers during an early adopter phase to evaluate the features and functionalities. To date there are already 10 ‘early adopter’ suppliers working with Airbus to test and help mature the new supplier-related components of Skywise. These participants represent a very broad spectrum of commodities including cabin, propulsion, aerostructures, materials and equipment/systems. They were chosen not only for their strategic representation, but also for their overall willingness and ‘digital readiness’. Three of these are collaborating with Airbus on strategic ‘use cases’, encompassing three domains: Supply Chain, Quality and Aircraft Operability. For each of these domains, Airbus has developed dedicated applications with its Skywise partner – Palantir Technologies. These applications, described below, are already demonstrating success, and Airbus is expanding access to new platform members:

1. Supply Chain application: “Dispatch”

Skywise Dispatch will increase efficiency and responsiveness to supply chain disruptions. The application is designed to improve demand management, aircraft assembly configuration, and on-time delivery, notably to prevent line-stops. The application aligns supplier production planning and Airbus’ demand to create a single ‘source of truth’. This enables fast and easy root-cause analysis of recurring missing parts and anticipation, notably through a better visibility into production status. The lead partner in this pilot phase is Premium Aerotec. At the company, Skywise Dispatch is active across five functions where it is delivering 25% time savings, and full roll-out planned in Nordenham to 50 additional users.

Dr. Thomas Ehm, Chairman of the Executive Board of Premium Aerotec said: “By using the collaborative platform Skywise, the company takes a big step towards its smart factory vision. Skywise allows full transparency and big data analytics on a huge amount of data in order to recognize trends that require early actions to ensure a stable manufacturing process.”

2. Quality application: “Object Explorer”

Skywise Object Explorer improves the quality of suppliers’ services and commodities by reducing the cost of non-quality incurred by both Airbus and suppliers, reducing the occurrence of quality shortfalls by identifying such trends early and by accelerating resolution. The key partner is Thales, for whom the application has typically been delivering a 30% reduction in part removals due to non-conformities (on a per-component basis).

Gil Michielin, EVP Thales, Avionics GBU said: “Skywise echoes the mutual goals for disruptive technologies pioneered across Thales and Airbus. Thales has accompanied Airbus’ ambitions for decades and its scope of industry leadership spans all areas of the connected aircraft, from nose to tail and beyond. The cultural change of this new initiative perfectly complements Thales’s multi-billion dollar investment in digital technologies. We are pleased to be strengthening our robust and trusted relationship with Airbus through this thrilling endeavour which aims at accelerating digital transformation throughout the aerospace sector.”

3. Aircraft operability application:

This application brings together Airbus and suppliers in a platform where they can collaborate securely and in real-time to resolve in-service issues faster and more accurately by leveraging in-service aircraft data to identify the root-causes of operational issues and exploring how to improve predictive maintenance services for airlines. The pioneering team in this collaboration is the partnership between easyjet, Liebherr and Airbus. Each partner has already benefitted from the partnership on the platform.

Nicolas Bonleux, Managing Director and Chief Sales Officer at Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation said: “The projects demonstrated that bringing together a wide range of data and conducting holistic analyses enable us to realise a much deeper and better understanding of the in-service behaviour of on-board systems and components, developed, manufactured, certified and serviced by Liebherr.”

JetBlue’s Founder Confirms He’ll Start a U.S. Airline With New Airbus Jets - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTgvMDcvMTcvamV0Ymx1ZXMtZm91bmRlci1jb25maXJtcy1oZWxsLXN0YXJ0LWEtdS1zLWFpcmxpbmUtd2l0aC1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWpldHMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAxOC8wNy8xNy9qZXRibHVlcy1mb3VuZGVyLWNvbmZpcm1zLWhlbGwtc3RhcnQtYS11LXMtYWlybGluZS13aXRoLW5ldy1haXJidXMtamV0cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"So much can happen between now and 2021. David Neeleman's new airline may never get off the ground. But let's hope for the best. The U.S. airline industry could use its first new entrant since 2007 to stir up competition.

Do you like comfortable aircraft, friendly service and low prices? You’ll likely have a new option in the United States as soon as three years from now.

Airbus on Tuesday confirmed what might have been the worst-kept secret in the U.S. airline industry. JetBlue Airways founder David Neeleman, who was pushed out as CEO of his own company in 2007 after mishandling the carrier’s operation, is starting a new U.S. carrier — and passengers almost certainly will be big winners if the startup goes as planned.

“After years of U.S. airline consolidation, the conditions are improving for a new generation of U.S. airline to emerge, focused on passenger service and satisfaction,” Neeleman said in an Airbus press release.

The last U.S. airline launch was Virgin America 11 years ago.

As reported last month in the trade journal Airline Weekly, Neeleman’s startup has reached a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 60 Airbus A220-300s, with deliveries starting in 2021. Until earlier this month, the aircraft was called the Bombardier CS300, but Bombardier, which had trouble marketing the aircraft, sold a controlling interest to Airbus.

Airbus made the Neeleman announcement at the Farnborough Air Show in England.

The A220, which will be powered by Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, typically seats about 140 passengers, but can fit up to 160. Passengers tend to like the airplane, which is already in service for Latvia’s Air Baltic, because it has few middle seats — it has two seats on one side and three on the other — and because it’s relatively quiet.

Airlines like it because it had advanced cockpit technology and burns about 20 percent fuel than comparable older aircraft, according to Airbus. It also can fly much farther than the typical aircraft of its size, and should easily be able to make it from coast-to-coast of the United States.

Neeleman has said little about his proposed new airline, but Airline Weekly reported he planned to look at secondary airports, particularly outside major cities. For airlines, it is easier to rent gates at those airports, and for passengers, they’re often easier to navigate.

“The A220 will enable us to serve thinner routes in comfort without compromising cost, especially on longer-range missions,” Neeleman said. “With deliveries starting in 2021, we will have ample time to assemble a world-class management team and another winning business model.”

The announcement did not say what Neeleman planned to call his airline. Airline Weekly reported it might be called Moxy Airways.

The news about the startup airline comes roughly a week after JetBlue also said it would add 60 A220 jets. The aircraft will replace older-model Embraer E190s in the airline’s fleet.

Delta Air Lines also has an order for the A220."

Narrow-body jets like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737MAX led the way in sales.

The Farnborough Airshow is the biennial midsummer meet-up of aviation's who's who.

As a result, the trade show has also become the battleground where Airbus and Boeing hold dueling press conferences to announce sale after sale after sale.

In less than 48 hours, Airbus and Boeing have reported an estimated $55 billion in orders and commitments at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow.

The hottest sellers are the narrow-body jets led by the Airbus A320neo family and the Boeing 737MAX.

Major Airbus deals include a commitment from an as-yet-unnamed leasing company for 80 A320neos worth $8.8 billion at list prices. It is customary for airlines and leasing companies to receive generous discounts when ordering in bulk.

And then there was the confirmation of an order for 60 Airbus A220-300 (nee Bombardier CS300) jets by JetBlue founder David Neeleman's upcoming airline startup.

The Boeing 737MAX is doing equally robust business with highlights including Air Lease Corporation's decision to buy and commit to 75 MAX 8 planes worth $8.8 billion. India's Jet Airways also ordered 75 737MAX 8 jets worth $8.8 billion, while Aviation Capital Group and Goshawk Aviation each ordered 20 Boeing 737MAX jets worth $2.3 billion per deal.

Leasing firm Jackson Square Aviation ordered 30 Boeing 737MAX jets worth $3.5 billion.

Brazilian airline Gol ordered 30 Boeing 737MAX 10s and 15 MAX 8 jets worth a combined $5.7 billion.

The market for wide-body jets has been equally action-packed. India's Vistara announced it would order six Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with an option for four additional aircraft. The total value of the deal is $2.8 billion at list prices. United Airlines bought four 787-9s worth $1.1 billion.

JetBlue: Airbus A220s offer more seats but cost 29% less to operate - USA TODAY,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTgvMDcvMTEvamV0Ymx1ZS1haXJidXMtMjIwLzc3NDU1NjAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue: New Airbus A220s to offer more seats, bigger bins on Embraer routes

JetBlue Airways will use 60 new Airbus A220 aircraft to replace its existing Embraer 190 planes with more seats aboard planes with larger overhead bins and windows, executives said Wednesday.

“We are absolutely thrilled with the A220, believing that it balances the needs of all of our stakeholders,” President Joanna Geraghty told investors and reporters during a conference call.

Marty St. George, JetBlue’s executive vice president for commercial and planning, said A220s are versatile enough with a 3,300 nautical-mile range to use on short and medium-length flights, and – possibly – for transcontinental service.

JetBlue will begin taking delivery of the jets in 2020.

Because A220s are more efficient, the airframes cost less to fly despite holding up to 40 percent more seats than the E190s they'll replace, officials said.

Markets ripe for larger A220s include routes like Westchester, New York, to Florida and Boston to Austin, Texas, and New Orleans, St. George said. The planes could eventually be flown on red-eye and daylight transcontinental service, and on red-eye service to the Caribbean, he said.

“There’s a sizable chunk of the existing 190 flying that is really much better flown in a much larger aircraft,” St. George said. “Some of these longer-haul routes (are) where we could really use these extra seats.”

The 60 A220s, which will replace 30 owned and 30 leased Embraer planes, will help convert the airline to an all-Airbus fleet, which JetBlue said would result in savings in crew training and maintenance.

The Airbus jets cost 29 percent less per seat to operate – including a 40 percent savings in fuel burn – than the existing Embraer planes, and they fly quieter with new Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, officials said.

“This is a game-changer for JetBlue,” said Steve Priest, JetBlue’s chief financial officer.

JetBlue had announced Tuesday it ordered 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft – planes that were previously called the Bombardier CS300 – for delivery beginning in 2020. The airline has an option for another 60 planes starting in 2025 that could be either A220-100 or -300 aircraft.

Compared to about 100 seats on the Embraer 190s, the A220-100s will have 120 seats and the A220-300 about 130 to 140 seats.

“We have a real opportunity to redefine the interiors,"" Geraghty said.

The A220 decision didn't anticipate offering premium Mint seats that include lie-flat seats, which aren't available on the Embraer planes. But Geraghty didn't rule out the possibility.

“This has been such a successful product for us that we’re always open to those ideas,"" she said.

As part of the agreement, JetBlue converted an earlier order for 25 A320neos to the larger A321neo and adjusted the delivery schedule.

JetBlue’s options during a 15-month fleet review was between larger Airbus 320 family or the next generation of A220 or Embraer 195. JetBlue officials offered cost comparisons to the existing 190 planes, but not the 195.

“We had to make a very, very difficult decision,” Priest said. “We believe the A220 is the perfect fit.”

The aircraft sparked an international trade dispute when Delta Air Lines ordered 75 of the version with 109 seats each. The U.S. International Trade Commission found Canadian government support for Bombardier worth triple each plane’s price tag but declined to impose a tariff for lack of harm to Boeing, which didn’t produce a similarly sized plane.

After the dust settled, Airbus had taken a majority stake in the Bombardier CSeries, with planes to be built in Mobile, Alabama, and Boeing had formed a joint venture with Brazilian regional-jet manufacturer Embraer.

· To include manufacturing technologies, urban air mobility and cabin technologies

The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and Airbus have renewed their framework agreement on research and technology (R&T) cooperation. This new five-year agreement builds on a long-standing relationship between the two organisations to cooperate on R&T development which spans more than 30 years. The NRC-Airbus agreement will cover a wide range of technical subjects and technologies.

Iain Stewart, President, National Research Council of Canada said: “This renewed framework agreement further strengthens the NRC’s long-standing strategic research and technology development relationship with a world-leading aerospace and defence company. With expertise across a wide range of disciplines, the NRC is well-positioned to partner with Airbus on the transformative technologies like advanced manufacturing and autonomous mobility that will reshape the aerospace industry over the next several years.”

Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Airbus said: “We are extremely pleased to continue our fruitful cooperation with the NRC. This is a logical step after the first agreement we signed 10 years ago to work jointly on research and technology. Renewing this agreement strengthens Airbus’ already prominent relationship with the Canadian industry and is all the more fitting with the recent decision to set up a dedicated Airbus presence in Mirabel for the A220 airliner programme.”

Notes for editors:

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. The company has been present in Canada for over 33 years and employs 2,000 Canadians. In 2015, Airbus sourced more than $1.1 billion directly from more than 570 Canadian aerospace companies."
A Look Inside the First Airbus A220-300 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2EtbG9vay1pbnNpZGUtdGhlLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLTMwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a ceremony Tuesday morning in Toulouse, France, Airbus officially introduced its newest aircraft: the Airbus A220. That said, the only new part of this aircraft is its name. Prior to today, the Airbus A220-100 was the Bombardier C Series CS100 and the Airbus A220-300 was known as the Bombardier C Series CS300.

Still, when the newly renamed A220-300 landed in Toulouse for a media event, I jumped on the chance to explore the inside of the aircraft.

The Airbus/Bombardier partnership chose an A220-300 for this special event. This aircraft, the larger version of the two-aircraft family, was the second CS300 ever produced, with MSN (Manufacturer's Serial Number) 55002. Despite Airbus' control over the program, the Airbus/Bombardier partnership will be based in Canada. So, it's still fitting for this aircraft's registration to be Canadian: C-FFDO.

As this aircraft is a test vehicle, there's a notice next to the main boarding door informing passengers and crew that ""this aircraft is operating without a certificate of airworthiness.""

As I rarely get the chance to ""turn left"" from the boarding door, I took advantage this time to check out the cockpit:

The C Series was not designed to be an Airbus, it only became one when the European company bought the program. But it looks like one on the flght deck, with a side-stick rather than the yoke you'd find on Boeing aircraft. That's the easiest way to tell Airbus cockpit from Boeings.

The A220-300 passenger cabin looked just the same as the CS300 — just with new A220 headrest covers:

The Airbus A220-300 demonstrator isn't fitted with a business class. Instead, this high-density model seems designed to be shown off to airlines for short-haul operations. The bulkhead seats get extra legroom in this layout.

And, the overwing exit row also gets extra legroom:

You may unsubscribe at any time.

One of the features that passengers like about the C Series aircraft is the seat width, especially for short-haul aircraft. Seats measure between 18 and 20 inches wide, depending on how the airline chooses to arrange them.

While the seats are wide, the pitch is set at just 30 inches in most arrangements. There's enough legroom for most passengers due to the slimline seats, but the thin cushioning led TPG contributor Lori Zaino to describe her experience as ""sitting on a rock"" during a six-hour flight on AirBaltic's CS300.

Another good passenger-experience aspect of the A220 is that its designed with enough overhead bin space to allow each passenger to carry on a rollaboard bag.

The only difference I could find between this A220 and the AirBaltic CS300 I explored in April — besides the new livery and the A220 headrest covers — was the lack of small overhead video screens. This was a feature that I'd assumed was built into each C Series aircraft, but perhaps is an optional accessory.

Besides the rare chance to check out the cockpit, this tour only confirmed one thing: Airbus seems to just be changing the name of the C Series to the A220, while leaving everything else as is. Considering the C Series has generally gotten positive reviews from passengers (except the hard seats) and airlines, for its reliability and operational performance, Airbus is wise to leave it as is."

European aerospace giant Airbus conducted Thursday the first test flight of the giant new Beluga XL, an even bigger version of the company's workhorse transport plane which has been in service since the mid 1990s.

Decorated for the occasion as a ""whale in the sky"", the plane's crew took off at exactly 10:30 am to a cheering crowd of 10,000 people at Airbus's facility in Toulouse, southern France.

The A330-743L Beluga XL has grown six meters (20 feet) longer and one metre wider from the Beluga ST, stretching its carrying capacity by 30 percent.

Airbus says that at 19 metres tall the plane is as big as a three-storey house and can carry up to 51 tonnes of cargo, the equivalent of seven adult male elephants—though animals cannot be transported because the hold is not pressurised.

The five planes being developed will be used to ferry around parts for building Airbus's other range of planes at its production sites across Europe.

Two wings of the A350 long-haul passenger jet can now be carried, instead of just one previously, for a maximum distance of 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles).

Airbus US CEO on Why A330neo Isn't Selling - Business Insider,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXVzLWNlby1vbi13aHktYTMzMG5lby1pc250LXNlbGxpbmctMjAxOC030gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A330neo is Europe's answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus Americas CEO Jeff Knittel believes the lower sales of the A330neo is due to a soft than normal widebody jet market as well as an unfavorable replacement cycle for older planes.

Knittle said he believes sales will pick up once the A330neo enters service.

The Airbus A330neo is Europe's answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Instead of creating brand a new aircraft from scratch as Boeing did with the Dreamliner, Airbus decided to optimize the existing Airbus A330ceo or ""current engine option"" jet that has been around since the mid-1990s.

Airbus launched the updated A330neo or new engine option at the Farnborough Airshow in 2014. Since then, the A330neo has netted 224 orders from airlines around the world with Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia X as its largest customers with 66 on order. The A330neo's only US airline customer is Delta with 25 orders on the books.

While 224 orders in four years are nothing to scoff at, the A330neo has lagged behind the rival Dreamliner in the sales department. The Boeing jet has taken more than 400 orders in the same period and has sold nearly 1,400 units since 2004.

According to Airbus America's new CEO Jeff Knittel, the A330neo's lack of sales can be attributed to a soft widebody jet market and the replacement cycle of existing airliners.

""The widebody market, in general, has been slower over the past year or two and some of that can be attributed to the replacement cycle,"" Knittel told Business Insider at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow.

The current generation Airbus A330ceo is still on sale and is one of the most popular widebody airliners in the world. As result, Knittel said, the A330 is still a ""relatively young aircraft"" in many operators' fleets and have not hit their replacement cycle yet.

""When you have airplanes that are older, the analysis to flip them out and put in new airplanes is much easier and in most cases fairly obvious,"" the former chief of executive of airplane leasing firm C2 Aviation Capital said. ""But the A330ceo is a good airplane with good range and has been improved a lot over the past 10 years.""

This has led many potential buyers to hang on to their current fleet of very capable planes a little longer.

""As the replacement cycles come and as the A330neo enters peoples' fleets, I think you will see sales accelerate on that airplane because they will see that (the neo) is a fundamentally improved aircraft over what was already a very good aircraft, to begin with,"" Knittel said.

The A330neo features updated aerodynamics, fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, and the big brother A350's AirSpace interior design."
"Airbus seeks to sell passengers on ""experience"" of A330neo - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDcvYWlyYnVzLXNlZWtzLXRvLXNlbGwtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1vbi1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9mLWEzMzBuZW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having sold more than 200 Airbus A330ceos through the end of May since the launch of the new engine A330neo program, the European airframer says it has no end date in sight for production of the current generation widebody.

Yet it also expressed no concerns about the state of A330neo sales during a media briefing last week in Chicago, before the twinjet flew to Atlanta and completed its route-proving tour in advance of “imminent” certification.

Decked out in TAP Air Portugal’s livery and interiors, the production aircraft used in the flight-test program is expected to be delivered to the European operator in September, and offers a step change improvement in the passenger experience.

Split sales

Through May, the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered A330neo, featuring new pylons and nacelles for the larger, more fuel-efficient engines; new longer wingspan, and key elements of Airbus’ popular Airspace interior, had attracted 214 firm orders.

The A330-900, which is the neo version of the A330-300, and the A330-800, the neo version of the -200, share 99% commonality, though the -800 boasts greater range and has not seen robust sales yet, not by a long stretch.

“It’s extremely easy for airlines to incorporate this aircraft, two sizes, in their fleets,” suggested A330neo product manager Silvia Ustupska.

Airbus recently saw a small boost to the A330neo backlog with a 10-aircraft order from an undisclosed customer. But multiple media reports suggest the airframer is fighting to formally nail down and expand its existing order from AirAsia for the low-cost, long-haul AirAsia X brand.

In unleashing the full center fuel tank with the 242-tonne A330-300, Airbus “made the plane so capable that it arguably hurt sales of the A330-900”, posited RGN contributor Gavin Werbeloff on Twitter.

But Airbus execs at the briefing in Chicago noted that the production lines of the A330ceo and A330neo run parallel, and Airbus does not have a timeframe for when it will stop the A330ceo. They pointed to continued military derivatives of the A330ceo, and freighter demand.

A step change in #PaxEx

From a passenger experience perspective, Airbus is convinced it has a winner on its hands with the A330neo. When developing the interior, Airbus invited airlines to customer focus groups, and they told the airframer they wanted “a similar cabin to the A350”, but not pivoting overhead bins, said Ustupska.

That’s why Airbus is offering the lighting and customization of Airspace, which originated on the A350, but adopted a large fixed bin for the A330neo because airlines saw it as “a really good idea, it’s very easy on maintenance and it wouldn’t intrude onto any passenger space”.

Added Ustupska: “We looked at the fuselage geometry [of the A330] and we found some space behind [it] so we were able to basically move the bin a couple of degrees and we have basically made it deeper [for the A330neo].” That means that if passengers load their bags longitudinally, you can put five bags in the A330neo bin instead of two or three bags.

A new modular Smart-Lav on offer from Airbus can optimize space on board the A330neo, though TAP Air Portugal has not selected this option to densify with more seats.

Airlines which want to accommodate passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) – or are compelled to do so by regulators – have the option of selecting a large-footprint lavatory, or they can adopt side-by-side lavs integrated into the A330neo’s rear galley and lavatory complex, and which open in the middle to provide a swinging partition between the two to ensure maneuverability. The design is similar to one of the two PRM lav options on offer through Airbus’ Space-Flex configuration for the A320.

Ustupska said Airbus found space not utilized on the A330 to accommodate the two-lav, rear-complex solution on the A330neo. “So today, if you have 16 trolleys, with the neo you can have 15 trolleys plus two lavatories. It means that it’s an extremely efficient configuration to have and on top you have the PRM function. It means that you are really using the revenue area to earn money.”

TAP Air Portugal is offering the solution, as demonstrated to Runway Girl Network by Ian Petchenik, who handles communications for flight tracking web site FlightRadar24:

https://twitter.com/RunwayGirl/status/1015226797204672512

Unfortunately for PRMs, not all countries require airlines to offer accessible lavatories. “If an aircraft is flying to the US, it’s compulsory. There are countries that are not imposing these rules on airlines and we have layouts where a PRM lavatory is nonexistent,” confirmed Ustupska. But if they choose the rear-complex solution, the PRM lavs will be “there by default”.

When airlines select the standard configuration for the A330neo, in three classes, the -900 seats 287 passengers and the -800 seats 257 passengers.

The standard eight-abreast layout in economy class equates to a comfortable 18” seat width for passengers, though Ustupska conceded that long-haul, low-cost carriers – which gravitate towards high-density seating configurations – are poised for growth.

As has been well reported, TAP selected Recaro CL3710 slimline seats for its 2-4-2 economy cabin and is featuring an extra legroom economy section rather than a dedicated premium economy class.

When economy class passengers fold up their armrests, the armrests do not jut out, but rather lie flush against the seat architecture. This makes it easier to sell two seats to a passenger of size or a disabled passenger, or for travel companions to share that space. And it remedies a problem seen on other aircraft, including the Recaro seats on Qatar Airways’ original 787s.

The Panasonic inflight entertainment (IFE) system on board the TAP A330neo is fully integrated and electronics boxes do not encumber the legroom of economy class passengers. As on the A350, Airbus was keen to ensure a more integrated IFE experience for passengers on the A330neo.

TAP picked Recaro’s new compact CL6710 model for its business class cabin. The Portuguese carrier was originally expected to be the launch customer for the CL6710, but Recaro actually ended up launching it last year with El Al, and it has secured both China Southern and Azul as customers as well, Recaro communications and marketing specialist Joe Snell told Runway Girl Network.

In TAP’s business class, passengers can use their IFE monitors gate-to-gate without cranking their necks. “We had to go through special certification so you can adjust your monitor when you get on your airplane. You don’t have to worry about the altitude,” noted Snell.

Airbus has timed the A330neo for the A330ceo replacement market, but it would also like to see the type replace Boeing 767s and older generation 777-300ERs. It views the A330neo as a competitor to the Boeing 787, with fuel burn touted as being akin to or even better than the 787.

A replacement and a competitor

Ustupska suggested that the A330neo’s air conditioning system, the flow of the air in the cabin, the new engines and the aerodynamic noise of the aircraft equate to a quieter ride than the 787. “We are here to compete with the 787 – replace our old aircraft and compete with the 787.”

But more broadly, Airbus head of external communications James Darcy said in reference to the A330neo interior: “At the end of the day we’re selling the experience to the airline passengers, that’s the final user of the product.”

At a time when Delta Air Lines has just bucked industry trends and opted to retain a comfortable 9-abreast layout on its refurbished Boeing 777s, it’s clear that some passengers are paying more attention to #PaxEx than ever before. That could prove good news for those airlines that offer humane conditions on board, such as found on the eight-abreast A330neo with new bins, IFE and Airspace cabin attributes.

Airbus to sell 60 smaller planes to JetBlue - Phys.org,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTA3LWFpcmJ1cy1zbWFsbGVyLXBsYW5lcy1qZXRibHVlLmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOC0wNy1haXJidXMtc21hbGxlci1wbGFuZXMtamV0Ymx1ZS5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US company JetBlue has signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of 60 A220-300 aircraft, the former Bombardier CSeries, valued at $ 5.37 billion, Airbus said

Airbus announced Tuesday a deal to sell US airline JetBlue 60 airplanes that were formerly part of Canadian manufacturer Bombardier's C series.

It was the first contract since the aircraft were rechristened by the European aerospace giant as the A220-300, which can carry between 100 and 150 passengers.

Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding with US carrier JetBlue for a contract worth about $5.4 billion based on list prices, the company said.

The aircraft is the larger of two C-series planes produced by Bombardier prior to a joint venture with Airbus that went into effect July 1.

Airbus held a ceremony earlier Tuesday at its Toulouse, France headquarters, calling the rebranding of the planes ""an historic moment.""

The two companies announced their joint venture in October, a move that initially gave the European company a leg up on rival Boeing in the small-jet market.

However, Boeing last week said it reached a similar deal with Brazil's Embraer that would give it a line of smaller planes to compete in that segment.

Airbus said it also reached a deal with JetBlue to convert 25 current orders for the Airbus A320neo into orders for the larger A321neo.

""JetBlue's selection of the A220 aircraft as a complement to its growing A320 Family fleet is a tremendous endorsement, both of the A220 itself and of the way these two aircraft can work together to provide airline network flexibility and a great passenger experience,"" said Eric Schulz, chief commercial officer for Airbus.

The crew in the cockpit on board this flight comprised: Captain Christophe Cail, Co-Pilot Bernardo Saez-Benito Hernandez and Test-Flight Engineer Jean Michel Pin. Meanwhile, monitoring the aircraft systems and performance in real-time at the flight-test-engineer’s (FTE) station were Laurent Lapierre and Philippe Foucault.

Following the first flight, the BelugaXL will undergo some 600 hours of flight test over 10 months to achieve Type Certification and entry into service later in 2019.

The BelugaXL programme was launched in November 2014 to address Airbus’ transport capacity requirements in view of the A350 XWB ramp-up and Single-Aisle production rate increases. Five aircraft will be built between 2019 and 2023 to gradually replace the five BelugaST.

The aircraft will operate from 11 destinations as Airbus’ method of transporting large aircraft components.

Based on an A330-200 Freighter, the BelugaXL is powered by Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines. The lowered cockpit, the cargo bay structure and the rear-end and tail were newly developed jointly with suppliers, giving the aircraft its distinctive look.

The Vector seat is now included in the A350 aircraft catalogue for line-fit selection. In addition, HAECO has secured a launch customer for line-fit A320 series seating with a sizeable carrier in Asia.

Offerability in the catalogue is achieved after Airbus determines a supplier’s ability to reliably deliver seats to meet production line and customer requirements. Having Vector Economy approved by Airbus enables HAECO Cabin Solutions to present and offer seating solutions to line-fit customers more efficiently.

HAECO Cabin Solutions and Airbus have also launched the offerability process for Vector Economy on A320 Family aircraft, and Vector Premium for both A320 Family and A350 XWB Family.

Doug Rasmussen, President and Group Director of HAECO Cabin Solutions, said, “With Vector, HAECO has developed a true platform-based product, which shares many parts and features between the Economy and Premium versions of the seat. Adding line-fit offerability demonstrates the trust Airbus has placed in HAECO Cabin Solutions to deliver this seat platform to line-fit customers with tighter lead times.”

HAECO Cabin Solutions achieved FAA Technical Standard Order (TSO) C127b authorization in March 2018 for the Vector Premium seat, following Vector Economy in 2016. Adding Vector to the Airbus catalogue will expedite the process for airline customers to select the platform.

Airbus marks two milestones for Zephyr solar-powered drone - Defense News,"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvZmFybmJvcm91Z2gvMjAxOC8wNy8xNi9haXJidXMtbWFya3MtdHdvLW1pbGVzdG9uZXMtZm9yLXplcGh5ci1zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLWRyb25lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH, England — With the Farnborough air show opening in searing temperatures it was perhaps appropriate that Airbus Defence and Space used the first day to announce two program milestones with it’s Zephyr solar powered unmanned air vehicles.

Airbus announced July 16 that series production of the Zephyr S high altitude pseudo-satellite had begun at a new facility sited about 200 yards from where Farnborough 2018 was being held.

Just as important in terms of proving the solar powered vehicle’s operational capabilities, Airbus revealed the first of three Zephyr S vehicles ordered by the British Ministry of Defence made its maiden flight from a base in Arizona last week.

Zephyr, which operates on the edge of space, already holds the world duration record at 14 days. Nigel Chandler, the head of sales for the solar electric powered vehicles, says that recent improvements will see the vehicle beat 100 days.

To date the Zephyr family has racked up over 1000 flying hours and their experience far exceeds any rival operators.

Earlier this year BAE Systems announced it was collaborating on a rival solar powered high altitude, long endurance vehicle designed by Farnborough-based company Prismatic. First flight of a vehicle known as the PHASA-35 is slated for next year.

The MoD here has invested some £13 million (U.S. $17.21 million) in securing the vehicles for operational concept demonstration work. The latest S version of the Zephyr family were acquired by the British military in a deal signed in 2016.

The arrangement will see the vehicles owned by the MoD but operated by Airbus.

Nobody at Airbus was saying what role the British envisions for the Zephyr, but the machines have previously been touted in media as capable of providing surveillance or communications relay capabilities, possibly for special forces.

The third vehicles ordered by the MoD were visible and complete on the floor of the new Airbus production facility.

Previous test and prototype versions of Zephyr were built at a research and development site nearby.

Dirk Hoke, the CEO of Airbus Defence and Space said the official opening of the facility “represents a significant milestone in the Zephyr program. The facility is home to the world’s leading high-altitude pseudo satellite and will be a showcase location, linking to our operational flight bases around the world. …Today we have created a new future for stratospheric flight.”

Chandler said that by the end of this year up to seven aircraft will have been built at the series production site. Next year that number should rise to 10 and could eventually be amped up to 30 if demand warrants it.

Some of the Zephyr production will go to Airbus itself. Chandler said one of principle business opportunities is to use Zephyr as a managed service.

The service would offer launch and recovery, payload integration, piloting, airspace management and other requirements.

In future, Airbus will be flying Zephyr S from a new operating site at the Wyndham airfield in Western Australia. Airbus said it has chosen Australia as the first launch and recovery site for the Zephyr due mainly to its largely unrestricted airspace and reliable weather. The site will be operational from September this year with the first flights expected during October.

It’s not clear whether the British MoD will use the Australian site for some of its concept demonstration work.

Airbus has also developed a ground station in a box to allow operations to be conducted where customers have a requirement.

Airbus Adds HAECO's Seating Products to Linefit Catalogs - APEX Media,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcmJ1cy1hZGRzLWhhZWNvcy1zZWF0aW5nLXByb2R1Y3RzLWxpbmVmaXQtY2F0YWxvZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Adds HAECO’s Seating Products to Linefit Catalogs Share

APEX Insight: The addition of HAECO’s Vector seat to Airbus’ catalog means the Hong Kong-based seat manufacturer can offer seating solutions to linefit customers more efficiently.

Airlines have a new choice for linefit seating on the Airbus A350 XWB and A320 family aircraft. The Vector Economy seat from HAECO Cabin Solutions is now approved as an offerable supplier for passenger seating in the Airbus twin-jet catalog. HAECO and Airbus also started the offerability process for Vector Economy seating on the A320 family and for the Vector Premium seat in both the A320 and A350 families.

Airbus determines offerability in its catalogs by evaluating a supplier’s ability to reliably deliver seats to meet production line and airline customer requirements. The Vector Economy seat’s approval by Airbus will enable HAECO Cabin Solutions to present and offer seating solutions to linefit customers more efficiently.

HAECO also announced it has secured a linefit A320 launch customer for its Vector Economy seat, which it described as a “sizeable carrier in Asia.”

“With Vector, HAECO has developed a true platform-based product.” – Doug Rasmussen, HAECO Cabin Solutions

Doug Rasmussen, president and group director of HAECO Cabin Solutions, highlighted the commonality of components across its aricraft seating product lines. This could ease the manufacturing and maintenance processes and support HAECO’s efforts to expand the catalog offerability to additional seating products and aircraft families. “With Vector, HAECO has developed a true platform-based product, which shares many parts and features between the Economy and Premium versions of the seat,” he said.

“Adding linefit offerability demonstrates the trust Airbus has placed in HAECO Cabin Solutions to deliver this seat platform to linefit customers with tighter lead times.” – Doug Rasmussen, HAECO Cabin Solutions

Rasmussen continued, “Adding linefit offerability demonstrates the trust Airbus has placed in HAECO Cabin Solutions to deliver this seat platform to linefit customers with tighter lead times.” By meeting the Airbus requirements for catalog listing, HAECO joins other seating manufacturers, large and small as a choice for airlines on these aircraft as they are delivered from the assembly line.

Getting to linefit status is seen as a significant accomplishment and validation of the supply chain and manufacturing process for a component supplier. It should also ease the selection process for a supplier’s airline customers as aircraft can be delivered directly with new seats rather than requiring a costly retrofit process."
Future U.S. airline signs commitment for 60 A220-300 aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNy1mdXR1cmUtdXMtYWlybGluZS1zaWducy1jb21taXRtZW50LWZvci02MC1hMjIwLTMwMC1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new U.S. airline start-up announced a commitment today for 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, with deliveries beginning in 2021. The Memorandum of Understanding was revealed at the Farnborough Air Show. This new airline is backed up by a group of experienced investors led by David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue, investor in TAP in Portugal and controlling shareholder in Azul airlines in Brazil.



“After years of U.S. airline consolidation, the conditions are improving for a new generation of U.S. airline to emerge, focused on passenger service and satisfaction,” said David Neeleman, majority investor in the new venture. “The A220 will enable us to serve thinner routes in comfort without compromising cost, especially on longer-range missions. With deliveries starting in 2021, we will have ample time to assemble a world-class management team and another winning business model.”

“This U.S. airline startup’s decision for the A220 as the platform on which to launch their new business model is a testament to the passenger appeal and operating economics of this outstanding aircraft,” said Eric Schulz, Chief Commercial Officer for Airbus. “This commitment confirms the important role the A220 aircraft now occupies in our Airbus single-aisle portfolio.”

Complementing the A320 Family, the A220-100 and A220-300 models cover the segment between 100 and 150 seats and offer a comfortable five-abreast cabin. With the most advanced aerodynamics, CFRP materials, high-bypass engines and fly-by-wire controls, the A220 delivers 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation aircraft. The type will serve a worldwide market for smaller single-aisle airliners, estimated at at least 7,000 such aircraft over the next 20 years. Airbus markets and supports the A220 aircraft, which is manufactured under the recently finalized partnership agreement between Airbus, Bombardier & Investment Québec.

The A220-300 will be powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines

Completed in April, the prototype BelugaXL is the first in a new generation of freighters that will replace the exiting BelugaST. Like its predecessor, the BelugaXL can swallow entire fuselage sections and wings of smaller Airbus airliners from factories in Germany and the UK and carry them to final assembly in Toulouse.

Wearing an appropriately whale-themed paint job, the BelugaXL has a payload of 53 tons (6 more tons than the BelugaST), which will let it carry two Airbus A350 wings and the giant tail for the A380. It can even fit the fuselage section for the A330, the aircraft on which the its bloated profile is based.

Airbus reveals its Network for the Sky military communications solution - Airbus,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNy1haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1pdHMtbmV0d29yay1mb3ItdGhlLXNreS1taWxpdGFyeS1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Farnborough, 13 July 2018 – Airbus will unveil its secure networked airborne military communications solution, Network for the Sky (NFTS), at the Farnborough International Airshow 2018. NFTS combines different communication technologies to form one resilient global mesh network, allowing aircraft to be fully part of a high-speed connected battle space.

Leveraging its unique breadth of experience in aircraft, satellites and secure military communications, Airbus is preparing a communication network solution that is interoperable between aircraft, satellites, command centres and mobile units deployed on the ground or at sea.

“Network for the Sky aims to offer the same seamless experience that people have with their mobile phone when it switches from one network to another or from 4G to Wi-Fi without realising it, but with the reliability and cybersecurity standards of military communications,” said David Kingdon-Jones, Head of NFTS at Airbus Defence and Space. “The difference is that, in the sky, it is not only the users who are mobile, but also the network, since aircraft themselves constitute the nodes of that network. Given their speed, two aircraft may only have a few seconds to exchange information that is critical for the mission.”

Today, individual aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and helicopters continue to operate on separate networks with limited interoperability between them and often little resilience. Their bandwidth is also usually insufficient for transferring large volumes of data. For example, on combat aircraft, Link 16 and UHF/VHF communication systems offer data rates of only a few kbit/s which is basically suited to voice communications and the exchange of position coordinates.

NFTS will integrate various technologies, such as satellite links with geostationary, medium and low Earth orbit constellations, tactical air-to-ground, ground-to-air and air-to-air links, voice links, 5G mobile communication cells and laser connections, into a single global secure network.

This intelligent network can be reconfigured at any time and prioritises exchanges based on data flows, mission objectives and available bandwidth on the different links.



The management of end-to-end, seamless connectivity will thus be transparent to users.

NFTS will also see the rollout of a new generation of communication terminals and antennas that can be perfectly integrated into the fuselage, capable of managing different frequency bands and remaining connected despite rapid manoeuvres by the aircraft.

Providing connectivity for the entire duration of air missions, the network will enable information superiority and extend the multi-mission capabilities of aircraft. Mission aircraft will be able to share in real-time applications and data stored on board via a combat cloud. It will be possible to re-task in-flight combat aircraft and helicopters from the ground by uploading updated mission plans, for example to strike targets of opportunity. It will also be possible to operate fleets of tactical UAVs in swarms. High-altitude platforms, such as Zephyr, will create permanent communication cells of several hundred kilometres in diameter in order to relay aircraft communications via Airbus’ SpaceDataHighway laser links.

NFTS is offered as a modular, end-to-end solution, with the first phase already available. This involves standardising the use of high-speed satellite connectivity on aircraft from this point onward thanks to a range of antennas which have the capability to switch from one satellite beam to another in-flight. Thus the V/UHF radio links and L16 can be extended via a satellite communication relay from a few hundred kilometres to thousands of kilometres.

Network for the Sky is the foundation for the connected airborne battlespace, with the objective to offer a full operational capability by 2020. The NFTS programme is part of Airbus’ Future Air Power project and is fully aligned with the development of the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

Following months of industry speculation, the ceremony at the Henri-Ziegler Delivery Centre near Toulouse confirmed that the Bombardier C Series is being renamed to conform to Airbus naming practice. It's now the A220 family. The jet displayed in Toulouse, which formerly would have been known as a Bombardier CS 300, was labeled an A220-300. The smaller CS 100 will be known as an A220-100.

A small crowd of executives and media gathered to watch the plane make its landing in Toulouse.

""Everyone at Airbus has been looking forward to this historic moment,"" Guillaume Faury, Airbus President for Commercial Aircraft, said in remarks released afterward by Airbus. ""Today, we are thrilled to welcome the A220 to the Airbus family and are honoured to see it wearing its new Airbus colours for the first time,""

The ceremony followed one last week in Mirabel, Canada, at which Airbus welcomed Bombardier staff to the Airbus family. Continuing that theme of partnership, Faury made note of their role.

""I pay tribute to all the women and men at Bombardier and the supply chain who have strived over the past years to bring this fantastic aircraft to the world,"" he said. ""The A220 now enters a new phase in its career with all Airbus' resources behind it to further its commercial success worldwide.""

Eric Schulz, Airbus' chief commercial officer, said the company was ""enthusiastic about selling the A220"" thanks to features that give it ""a decisive edge in a very competitive market.""

Boeing recently announced a partnership with Brazil-based Embraer, a relationship that seems designed in part to compete with the Airbus-Bombardier joint venture.

Airbus and Bombardier have said they plan to build a new assembly line for the A220 in Mobile, Ala., where Airbus already assembles its larger A320 family. The company recently indicated that it hopes to begin construction on that assembly line by year's end, and deliver new jets by mid-2020.

Airbus released no additional detail on those plans on Tuesday. Further announcements may come during the impending Farnborough Air Show outside London.

Notes from the live feed of Tuesday's ceremony follow. Times listed are U.S. Central.

6:05 a.m.: Looks like that's it for now -- the C Series designed and developed by Bombardier has become the Airbus A220 family. Look for an update later with any additional information from today's ""special briefing"" in Toulouse.

5:54 a.m.: A few executives get off the jet. The live stream ends. It's not immediately clear how long it'll be before we can hear or read the speeches made for the occasion, or any new information revealed about the planned Alabama assembly line.

5:51 a.m.: While waiting for the pilots and passengers to disembark, a reminder: Last week in Mirabel, Canada, Airbus welcomed Bombardier folk to the family.

5:46 a.m.: Now they're splicing in some prerecorded footage showing the new paint job going on. Just a quick montage and they go back to the live feed as the jet approaches the waiting audience and the stage.

5:44 a.m.: There's a hatch above the cockpit, almost like a sunroof. Somebody has opened it and stuck out an ""Airbus"" flag as the jet taxis back from the end of the runway.

5:40 a.m.: More applause as the A220 makes a smooth touchdown. The Airbus A220-300 must be the equivalent of the CS 300, which suggests the smaller CS 100 will be the A220-100.

5:39 a.m.: Now it looks like the jet's coming in for a landing. The wheels are down.

5:34 a.m.: As the jet goes around, observers on the ground are now holding small ""A220"" flags. In keeping with advance speculation, Airbus has renamed Bombardier's C Series to fit its own naming conventions. (Airbus holds a majority stake in the partnership.)

5:31: It does a flyby. Looks like the designation is A220 on the tailfin. On the fuselage it's A220-300. There's applause from the group on the tarmac.

5:30 a.m.: The camera focuses on a jet in the hazy distance, comign in for a landing.

5:25 a.m.: A live feed begins on Airbus' YouTube channel, showing Airbus employees gathering by a runway in Toulouse. Multiple cameras are in use, including a drone or helicopter. We're waiting for the arrival of a Bombardier C Series jet. Aerospace industry news outlets speculate it'll have a new name and a new livery."

Eagle eyes - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA3LWVhZ2xlLWV5ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Before tomorrow’s vision of autonomous flight takes off, its groundwork needs to be set. With EAGLE, autonomy’s basic building block – sight – is being developed by experts at Airbus Helicopters.

A lone pilot, an injured hiker.

Faced with an unexpected humanitarian flight, the pilot engages his helicopter’s image-processing system; it flies them to a hospital while the pilot divides his time between the radio, his patient, and the final approach.

This is the future as seen by Airbus’ experts in autonomous solutions. In developing groundbreaking technology for self-piloting aircraft, they envision safer and more efficient means of transport—and the benefits that go with it.

Before a car can drive or a helicopter fly by itself, it needs images of the environment around it—onboard technology for image collection and analysis, linked to its central processing system and autopilot modes. At its helicopters division, Airbus is developing EAGLE as the “eyes” of autonomous aircraft. While it may not be applied on fully autonomous vehicles yet, EAGLE (Eye for Autonomous Guidance and Landing Extension) is an important step in making them available.

What is EAGLE?

EAGLE is a real-time video processing system for aircraft. In flight, it collects data from various sources, such as cameras, and analyses it by means of a computer algorithm that has been “trained” to use the imagery in conjunction with the autopilot.

“It’s a complete loop,” explains Nicolas Damiani, Senior Expert in Systems Simulation at Airbus Helicopters. “EAGLE provides information to the autopilot. The autopilot displays how it intends to manage the trajectory to the target point. And the pilot monitors the parameters to make sure they are coherent with the image that is being acquired by EAGLE.” The ultimate goal? Fully automating the approach, thereby reducing pilot workload during this critical phase.

What is EAGLE, in tangible terms?

EAGLE is comprised of cameras and a computer. The present prototype, for example, uses three cameras inside a gimbal gyrostabilised pod. The cameras are extremely high definition; each produces around 14 million pixels.

Why three? Damiani’s team set EAGLE an ambitious test-case: detect a helipad 2,000 metres away on a shallow four-degree slope approach. The resolution needed to zero in on such a target explains the combination of cameras. As the aircraft (in the test, an H225) starts its approach, the camera with a narrow field of view sends its input to the system. Medium-range, the system switches to the camera with a larger field of view, again switching during the landing to one with a fish-eye lens.

The optronics are pure prototype at this stage. “EAGLE is compatible with different camera options,” says Damiani. “Because we need to analyse 14 million pixels at around 30 Hz, its interface is made for high-resolution video stream. But EAGLE is also capable of using input from standard cameras.”

This may mean using a simpler optical part based on cameras that are installed on today’s helicopters, to automate approaches when it isn’t necessary to see the target in such detail.

Three cameras, so what?

EAGLE also comprises a many-core processor that is able to equate advanced algorithms. These are the centre of the project’s focus, because before EAGLE can be industrialised, the algorithms and the processing unit – made of 768 shading units dedicated to graphics – as well as 12 processors must first be certified.

“As soon as an algorithm is based on image processing, it is difficult to get it certified because it relies on technologies that are currently hard to confirm,” says Damiani. “The paradox is that the algorithms, especially those that are working on machine learning, are based on training the algorithm to learn by itself. In the end, even if the performance is good, it’s very difficult to predict its result because of operational conditions that differ from the image sets used for the training.” In other words, the algorithm may demonstrate a high level of problem-solving, but nobody really knows at the end what computations it had been running.

Research and development

To function in practice, EAGLE applies mathematic algorithms to detect the expected (helipads, for example) and others based on artificial intelligence for the unexpected (“intruders” like birds, private drones, etc.). Spotting a helipad uses algorithms that are not based on machine learning—a helipad’s standard shape is one the algorithm can count on. In the case of seeing and tracking intruders, developers are investigating deep learning algorithms. “The problem is that before the algorithm can become intelligent, you have to train it,” says Damini. “You have to get data on different approaches, in different environmental conditions.” In other words, a huge amount of data that is expensive to acquire and annotate—so as to “explain” the data to the convolutional neural networks (artificial neural networks used in machine learning, usually to analyse visual imagery).

To facilitate training the algorithm, Damiani’s team is developing an approach where 90% of the training could be done through simulation. Real-world data might be mandatory to complete the learning process, but simulators may be a cost-efficient complement.

The project’s next steps are to certify the product to make it available operationally, and to research additional algorithms and optronics, with the aim of developing a small, low-cost and accurate “eye” associated to a powerful “brain.”

By using computer technology in the service of autonomous flight, Airbus seeks to offer its customers more and better solutions. Systems such as EAGLE are at the heart of Airbus’ aim to provide global vertical flight solutions. Optimising flight trajectories, reducing pilot workload—technology that lets them focus on their missions and, sometimes, take easy decisions in unexpected situations."

"Airbus, Recaro plan new interior for route-proving A330neo - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDcvYWlyYnVzLXJlY2Fyby1wbGFuLW5ldy1pbnRlcmlvci1mb3Itcm91dGUtcHJvdmluZy1hMzMwbmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH — When Airbus delivers the TAP Air Portugal-liveried A330neo which has been featured at the Farnborough Air Show, on a globe-trotting route proving tour, and on media flights with key A330neo customers, it will be with an entirely new set of Recaro business class seats and a refurbished cabin.

While the route proving equipment was removed from the aircraft prior to Farnborough, further changes are also planned. Prior to the delivery to TAP, the entire aircraft cabin will be inspected for wear, and the business class seats will be replaced in their entirety.

That latter replacement will address the numerous fit and finish issues highlighted by media on board during the proving flights, Airbus executives explain to Runway Girl Network, with the airframer also planning a low-risk next tranche of introductions of business class seating for future deliveries.

As a result of the test aircraft’s refit, it will not, head of A330 marketing Crawford Hamilton tells RGN, be the first aircraft delivered to TAP. “Because this has been a flight test aircraft, because it’s been used for us to look at the air flows, because it’s been used by us to look at the temperatures, because it’s been used by us as a flight test aircraft, we haven’t got things like some of the dividers and things aren’t between the business class seats,” Hamilton says. “There’s also little things. It’s little detailed stuff. But it’s the kind of detailed stuff that airlines when an aircraft’s getting delivered think is really important. Of course, because we’ve had engineers off and on the aircraft and such, we’ve got scuffing on panels and things. What we do is we completely remake this aircraft for the interior, get it all perfect, and then it will go for delivery.”

The engines, too, will be swapped out for a fresh pair, with the pre-loved powerplants going to the testbed for the A330-800.

Within the cabin, Hamilton says “you’re not actually going to see too much change. All of the fundamentals are here. All the monuments are here. All the storage is here. We’ve still got work to do ourselves, some bit of works on the system side in terms of things like the mood lighting and such. It’s just, again, it’s detailed stuff.”

Yet details are fundamental to cabin success, as numerous examples in recent history have shown. While the centre pairs will receive central privacy dividers, there will, however, be no design change to the outboard seats, including to the privacy wings, which are less prominent than on some other competing products.

During proving flights, which also served as media events, the seats did not receive universal acclaim for their fit, finish and sturdiness. Airbus is fortunate in that it can point to these as “prototype” seats that will be replaced prior to delivery, reducing criticism from its invited media.

Around the cabin, some bright sparks of the A330neo Airspace design are already visible. The integration of the front of the cabin is elegant in the centre sections, including foot cubbies that overlapped remarkably into the forward galley, surmounted by side-facing storage lockers rather than galley cart storage and work surfaces. Stickers on the forward centre monument proclaimed these to be manufactured by AIM Altitude.

On the outboard sections, too, the aisle-adjacent passengers’ feet tuck underneath a side storage locker, although this raises somewhat less elegantly to a space just below the bins. The integration of these three monuments also means less space separation and noise insulation between the relatively small forward galley and the front rows of business class.

From a strategic perspective, Airbus — which was hit heavily by seating supplier delays and production quality on the A350, most notably in Cathay Pacific’s Zodiac Cirrus implementation — has either been very lucky, very smart or a bit of both in the order of deliveries to early A330neo customers. The premium seats furnished for the first tranche of A330neo aircraft are supplied by some of the seatmakers with the most reliable reputations for on-time delivery.

A330neo launch customer TAP was also expected to launch the Recaro CL3710, which in fact launched with El Al in a slightly different version for the Boeing 787 cross-section on El Al’s first Dreamliner, as the result of delays with the Rolls-Royce engines for the aircraft. There is a certain second-mover advantage here in terms of learning from the mistakes in the first production.

“We were actually quite glad that they chose this seat,” head of aircraft interiors marketing Anaïs Marzo da Costa tells RGN.

The next airline up, Marzo da Costa says, is WOW Air, which has selected Geven’s Comoda recliner for its WOW BigSeat, the seatmaker confirms.

The third aircraft is expected to be for Brazil’s Azul, which will take Airbus subsidiary Stelia’s Solstys seating, while the fourth will be Air Mauritius, which will install Solstys III, Marzo da Costa says.

The BelugaXL's paint job ""features beluga whale-inspired eyes and an enthusiastic grin,"" the aircraft company says. That whale flew over southern France, soaring over the coast and mountainside.

The jet is the first of a handful that Airbus will use to shuttle large aircraft components between its manufacturing facilities in Europe. Crucially, its expansive cargo area — the fuselage is nearly 30 feet in diameter — can carry two wings for the Airbus A350 jetliner.

Based on an A330 cargo plane, the BelugaXL features an oversized tail section, with a large horizontal stabilizer and fins.

To accept cargo, the plane's ""forehead"" (in keeping with the whale metaphor) hinges open, revealing a cavernous opening above the cockpit — which sits below the cargo floor.

The jet is capable of taking off with a total weight of 227 tons. Carrying a full load of more than 50 tons, the lumbering plane's maximum range is 4,000 kilometers (about 2,485 miles).

On its maiden flight of some four hours, the plane took off from France's Toulouse-Blagnac Airport and returned to the same spot, performing a low pass and tilting its wings ""hello"" on its way back to the runway.

The BelugaXL is slated to enter regular service in 2019."

Using drones approved by the aviation authorities with a higher than 5 kg payload

Farnborough, 18 July 2018 Airbus and International SOS, the world’s leading medical and security risk services company, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to jointly study the viability of using aircraft or unmanned systems to deliver medical cargo and supplies.

Under the agreement, Airbus will help to define and install reliable aircraft or unmanned aerial medical cargo deliveries as part of International SOS MedSupply services. MedSupply deploys medical supplies, specialist medical care and equipment to meet the requirements of preventive health programme or in support of a medical emergency in urban as well as unfamiliar and remote locations. The studies will look into both urban to rural and ship to shore deliveries.

Airbus and International SOS will thus collaborate on safe, secure and enterprise drone delivery for hub to hub distribution of medical cargo, compliant with local regulatory bodies, as International SOS have global operations worldwide in emergency evacuation or medical resupplying.

“We hope to develop a viable business partnership where we can assist International SOS with unmanned medical cargo delivery. This means using our cutting edge technology to potentially save lives, and transform the medical and travel security industry,” said Dirk Hoke, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus Defence and Space.

Arnaud Vaissié, CEO, Chairman and Co-Founder of International SOS, said: “Bringing together the Airbus expertise in securing aerial deliveries, and our global infrastructure assisting clients worldwide, is a clear move towards a greater efficiency. We are always striving to provide our clients with excellent customer service and this innovative venture will enable us into look into furthering our capabilities and enhancing our service.”

Potential medical cargo delivery pilot cases are being explored in Singapore and Indonesia, and Airbus and International SOS will work with the local civil aviation and maritime authorities in both countries to develop these capabilities. If successful, this could be extended to International SOS operations globally.

Other potential areas of cooperation under the MOU include support for mobile hospitals, space and satellite services.

Airbus testing RACER high-speed demonstrator in sim as development continues - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXRlc3RpbmctcmFjZXItaGlnaC1zcGVlZC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3ItaW4tc2ltLWFzLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWNvbnRpbnVlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has revealed new details of the progression of its high-speed RACER program — the compound helicopter developed under the Clean Sky 2 program and direct descendant of the record-breaking X3 technology demonstrator.

Like the X3, Racer — which stands for “Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft” — features a main rotor, along with two lateral pusher propellers mounted on short “box-wings” that provide lift and thrust in forward flight. The aircraft is still in development, but is already being flown by test pilots at Airbus in a fixed-base simulator.

“The configuration is surprisingly easy to fly, much easier than a tilt-rotor because you are basically flying a helicopter, but with one additional thrust control,” said Hervé Jammayrac, a former H175 project pilot and Airbus Helicopters’ chief test pilot, who also flew the X3 extensively. “If you want to accelerate, you have a switch on the collective to increase or decrease speed. In this configuration, you put the nose where you want to go, and you decelerate using that switch, and you can do this without any automation or autopilot at all.”

Following the success of the X3 program, which saw the aircraft reach a level flight speed of 255 knots and record more than 155 flight hours, Airbus was confident that the twin-propeller compound concept was sound, Jammayrac told Vertical. “We were not sure about the application of the specific design of the concept, but from the beginning we were confident of future development. We were not designing a one-shot project just to break records.”

Getting maximum performance from the X3 involved matching component limits closely to minimize performance bottlenecks. To reduce associated risks and development time, the team used an AS365 Dauphin as a donor airframe, mated with components that were already available but modern enough to confer a degree of future-proofing. While this means that a few critical components of the X3 now find themselves part of the RACER, including a modified variant of the H175 gearbox, others were replaced with recently available products such as Safran’s Aneto engine.

“While there is commonality [with X3] in RACER, there are differences because the aircraft has a different aim,” said Jammayrac. “With X3, we focused closely on safety issues but, as a prototype, [we weren’t] being held back by certification requirements. However, we are developing RACER with the aim of minimizing the time between certification and a production aircraft.”

The X3 was only flown under tightly controlled test conditions by highly qualified and experienced test pilots like Jammayrac. If successful, RACER’s direct derivatives will very quickly be operated “in the wild” by pilots of all experience and skill levels, so the safety factor is intrinsic to the system design. Something that Jammayrac says Airbus Helicopters is very focused on.

The most obvious impact of this has been on the placement of the propellers; the X3s were mounted on the front of the aircraft’s wings, but on the RACER, they’re found behind a biplane-style wing.

“Doing this creates a barrier in front of the propellers, and access to the cabin is in front of this barrier,” Jammayrac explained. “Also, the [box-wing] allows a large wing area beneath the rotor span so the aircraft remains compact, and the downwash effect on the wing area is minimized.” However, he did admit that it is too early to tell what penalties or compromises these changes will incur.

These compromises are currently being explored in Airbus Helicopters’ developmental fixed-base simulator, which Jammayrac is already using to assess the aircraft, although all he would say about this is that “it flies well.”

RACER is being developed under the Clean Sky 2 program, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of aviation, and while a target first flight date has been set, Airbus say safety and simplicity are at the heart of the project, and that the highest priority is to get the design right."

Airbus’ first BelugaXL is “all smiles” after rolling out from the paint shop in Toulouse, France, where this next-generation oversize cargo airlifter received its distinctive livery – which features beluga whale-inspired eyes and an enthusiastic grin.

With a bulging upper forward fuselage and enormous cargo area, Airbus’ BelugaXL already is highly recognisable. The addition of a cheerful face to the distinctly-shaped airframe will further reinforce it in the public’s mind. The unconventional paint scheme was selected by Airbus employees in a company-wide vote conducted last year.

The BelugaXL was launched in November 2014 to address the transport and ramp-up capacity requirements for Airbus beyond 2019. Derived from the freighter version of Airbus’ A330-200 jetliner, the BelugaXL is six metres longer, one metre wider and has a payload lifting capacity four-tonnes-greater than the current Beluga A300-600ST.

Preparing for service entry

To be operated by the Airbus Transport International (ATI) subsidiary, the fleet of five BelugaXLs will take over transporting complete sections of Airbus aircraft among the company’s production sites around Europe and to final assembly lines in France, Germany and Spain.

The paint shop rollout is another major milestone as Airbus’ first BelugaXL concludes a comprehensive ground testing phase – including a total of 72 specific evaluations required prior to the aircraft’s maiden flight. This included the heavy ground test phase, which focused on introducing loads into the highly modified airframe, followed by an eight-day ground vibration campaign that wrapped up earlier this month.

Scheduled for July, the BelugaXL’s upcoming maiden flight will kick off a 10-month flight test certification campaign leading to planned service entry in 2019.

The A220 family comprises two models, the A220-100 and A220-300, formerly Bombardier's C Series (CS100 and CS300). The aircraft are fully optimised for the 100- to 150-seat market.

Eric Schultz, Airbus' chief commercial officer, said that the A220 already is generating great interest among potential customers. He added this was no surprise as “our new colleagues have built something quite extraordinary. I don’t think it will be long before we hear news from the market"".

“I can assure you that work is well underway to make the A220 a commercial success, the market leader for aircraft between 100 and 150 seats,” Schultz added. “We trust that this segment could total as many as 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years – that’s an exciting prospect.”

Airbus took control of the C Series aircraft programme earlier this month after buying 50.01 per cent of the assets of the limited partnership that owns the C Series.

JetBlue will become the first customer for the Airbus A220 aircraft after signing a Memorandum of Understanding for 60 firm orders for the larger A220-300 model. In addition, it converted 25 of its current orders for Airbus A320neo aircraft into orders for the larger A321neo."
"Singapore signs data analytics agreements with Airbus, Rolls-Royce at Farnborough - Defense News","Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvZmFybmJvcm91Z2gvMjAxOC8wNy8xOS9zaW5nYXBvcmUtc2lnbnMtZGF0YS1hbmFseXRpY3MtYWdyZWVtZW50cy13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1hdC1mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Singapore has signed agreements with Airbus and Rolls-Royce at the Farnborough Airshow to leverage data analytics and digital technology to support new tanker aircraft that will enter service this year.

The Southeast Asian nation’s Defence Science and Technology Agency, or DSTA, has agreed to details of the first initiative under a recently announced digital technology collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space for the development of 3-D-printed spare parts for testing on Singapore’s new fleet of A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft.

The implementation agreement DSTA signed with Airbus at Farnborough will see the European aircraft manufacturer support the agency in designing and certifying parts produced by additive manufacturing for Republic of Singapore Air Force aircraft. Additive manufacturing is an alternative term for 3-D printing.

In addition, both parties have agreed to collaborate on data analytics for predictive maintenance. The head of Airbus D&S' military aircraft services, Stephan Miegel, said the collaboration will benefit the development of Airbus’ new SmartForce suite of maintenance data analytics launched at Farnborough. That suite is meant to help operators exploit aircraft data to improve troubleshooting, optimize maintenance efforts, predict maintenance needs and plan smartly for material demand.

DSTA also signed at the air show a memorandum of understanding with Rolls-Royce to partner on digital service solutions. The collaboration will focus on the use of data analytics aimed at optimizing the time and resources spent on engine maintenance. The memorandum also aims to improve the availability and performance of aircraft operated by the Air Force.

The service’s six A330s, which will be delivered later this year, are powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 700-series engine. Singapore has also ordered the H225M Caracal medium-lift helicopter from Airbus, with deliveries expected to begin in 2020.

Rolls-Royce engines also power the Air Force’s fleet of Lockheed Martin C-130B/H airlifters and Gulfstream G550 early warning aircraft.

The agreements signed by DSTA at Farnborough are in addition to a similar one Boeing announced in late June, which will see the American company jointly develop an information management tool leveraging data analytics to identify trends and insights on aircraft performance with the government agency.

This will be used to analyze flight and maintenance data for the service’s fleet of Boeing F-15SG Strike Eagle fighter jets and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters. The findings will also be used to develop algorithms for predictive analytics for smarter maintenance and operations.

Airbus and Era settle H225 lawsuit for $42 million - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 06 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1lcmEtc2V0dGxlLWgyMjUtbGF3c3VpdC1mb3ItNDItbWlsbGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Era Group has received $42 million from Airbus Helicopters as part of a settlement of an ongoing lawsuit related to Era’s purchase of 11 H225 Super Pumas.

Era was one of several companies seeking remuneration from Airbus for aircraft they claimed were no longer airworthy, as well as damages and costs. Among a range of allegations in the lawsuits, it was alleged that Airbus sold the helicopters in a defective state due to an inherent problem in the H225’s main gearbox.

The allegations stem from the grounding of the global H225 fleet following the fatal crash of a CHC-operated H225 near Turøy, Norway, on April 29, 2016, which claimed the lives of all 11 passengers and two pilots on board after the main rotor separated from the fuselage.

In its final report on the accident, released July 5, 2018, the Accident Investigation Board of Norway said the cause of the accident was a fatigue fracture in one of eight second stage planet gears in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox. The seizure of this caused the main rotor to detach.

In the weeks and months following the crash, regulatory agencies around the world lifted the grounding as Airbus Helicopters implemented a variety of measures designed to ensure the safe return to operation of the H225 fleet, including creating a “full-flow” magnetic plug to improve the detection of metal particles, excluding one of two types of planet gear from operation, and enhanced packaging for the main gearbox.

But in its lawsuit, filed in November 2016, Era alleged the representations made by Airbus regarding the safety, reliability, and design of the 225 and, in particular, the design and reliability of the main gear box, “were (and remain) demonstrably false in light of recent revelations by Airbus Helicopters that at least the second stage planet gears inside of the main gear box are irreparably defective, rendering the 225 unfit for flight.”

Airbus refuted the charge.

And in a third-quarter earnings call in November 2017, Era Group CEO Chris Bradshaw said the operator had reappraised its H225s at just $4 million per helicopter.

The settlement between the operator and the manufacturer covers “all claims made by Era against Airbus related to Airbus’ marketing and sale, and Era’s purchase, of 11 H225 model helicopters,” a stock exchange filing from Era states.

As part of the settlement, Airbus will also provide Era with “trade account credits” that can be used for up to five years. Neither party has admitted fault."

Seeing the Hawaiian Airlines Pualani on the tail of a graceful Airbus A330 as I enter San Francisco International Airport's airport roadways helps ease me into an aloha state of mind. From SFO, Hawaiian offers morning departures to Honolulu and Maui using widebody Airbus A330s.

Airport security on Sunday morning at 8 am is not too bad considering it is the Sunday after July 4th celebrations with many airlines and airports predicting busiest day of the year. Terminal and gates are busy but not as hectic as I expect.

Even though I'm jetting off to paradise, I'm on a business trip!

I've been invited down to Honolulu as a media guest of Hawaiian Airlines and Barclays. They are announcing the revamped Hawaiian Airlines credit card, and I'm flying in for a press conference and meetings with executives from the airline and the bank. Disclosure: Barclays covered the cost of this trip.

Let's jump onboard!

Flights depart from SFO's International Terminal A. Since I'm in first class, I board in Group 1, which was quick and easy.

Flight attendants in teal aloha shirts and flowers in their hair greet passengers as they board, saying ""Aloha!""

I enter the A330 mid-cabin and turn left, walk through two rows of extra comfort seats to the first class section. In first class, seats are configured 2-2-2, which means window seats don't have aisle access, but who cares? This is a really nice and unusual looking first class section with lie-flat seats for a five-hour flight. Some would say that's overkill, but it sure feels luxurious. (Don't miss the slideshow and captions at the top of this post!)

Seat recline is controlled with a flywheel so you can adjust it to the perfect angle. There's a nice protected footrest and plenty of space for storage around the seat in addition to overhead bins. I snuggle in and start to look around...

There are three rows (1-3) in first class, with four seats per row configured 2-2-2. From left to right, they are AB-FG-JH. The section is full, and there's already a couple with their seats in full recline sleeping (with eye masks on) when I board!

The color scheme of the first class cabin is cool baby blue, brown and gray. Brown leather seats appear tall and narrow, but are comfortable once you sit down. Aisle seats have an unusual guarded footrest (that angles out into the aisle) so passing carts don't hit. Overall the seat is roomier and more comfortable than it looks. The cabin is spotless and although this is not a new plane, the first class section is only two years old and feels brand new.

Overhead bin space is plentiful, even when cabin is full—bins are a bit small relatively speaking, but my fat rollaboard carry on squeezes in.

In-seat storage space is good with nooks in the seat space and on the floor. Thoughtfully, the bins in and around the seat are lighted to help navigate in the dark.

I'm in seat 2G on the right center aisle. I do not know my neighbor, but neither of us raises the translucent privacy panel that separates our personal space. But it does not matter because he sleeps for the duration of the flight.

You can take a look at a Hawaiian Airlines A330 layout here on SeatGuru.

Flight attendants pass out brunch menus before take off. While it's a 9 am departure, we arrive at around noon so I was hoping for lunch instead of brunch. Oh, well.

During boarding, flight attendants offer passengers POG (passion fruit, orange, guava juices), Prosecco, water or Mai Tais (yes indeed, even at 9 am). There's ukulele music playing.

Hawaiian Airlines prides itself in making passengers feel like they are in Hawaii as soon as they board the plane, and I have to say that they succeed in this like no other airline. My recent trips to Hawaii in United or Virgin America (see review) did not feel much different than my flights to New York or Atlanta. But this Hawaiian Air flight really felt different and ""special.""

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

Just before take off, I check out the lavatory and find something unusual: the floor is tiled—or it appears that way. I'm not going to go down there for a close inspection! But it's a nice homey touch.

I struggle to quickly send emails, texts and post photos to social media prior to departure knowing that there is not wi-fi onboard this or any Hawaiian Airlines plane. (Follow me on Instagram?).

Takeoff is unusually low and slow over the city, then right over the Golden Gate Bridge as we head out over the big green Pacific. Sometimes I wonder if pilots ask for a low altitude take off to see our beautiful city below when the weather is crystal clear. What a show! Sayonara, SF!

Shortly after take off, FA's distribute extra large iPad Pros with big 13-inch screens (I want one!) for entertainment. They fit into an unusual pole in the armrest that pops up, pivots over and holds them. (See slideshow.)

The iPad has 50 movies stored on it, which is plenty. I watch ""I Tonya."" (Hilarious and kind of sad with a stellar performance by Allison Janney as Tonya Harding's messed up mom!) There are also plenty of good new releases like the Greatest Showman, and perennial favorites like You've got Mail or Casablanca. Many of the titles are in Asian languages, too. (See all movies here)

Next, the FA brings me a fresh POG (remember, this is a business trip, so no early morning Mai Tais for me!). Along with that, I get a nice plate of about 25 macadamias—nice yes, but I wonder about the calorie count... macadamias are the most fattening of nuts, or so I have heard. (I looked it up afterwards, and that plate of nuts added about 400 calories to my daily intake.)

I hang in the galley for a bit talking to our flight attendant who tells me that she (and many others) pick fresh flowers from their yards to wear in their hair—she said that she keeps it cool and watered overnight so it is good for the round trip. Nice. I can smell it! ""It takes work to keep it fresh!"" she says. Hawaiian Airlines also provides flight attendants with artificial flowers for their hair. (See slideshow!)

Brunch is served on a wood-like tray with a slightly rubberized surface to keep things from sliding around during serving. Smart!

First course is fresh sliced fruit and zucchini bread and butter- a nice start!

This quiche was a bit disappointing-- rather tasteless and the sausage tough, but I ate it anyway because I was hungry Chris McGinnis

Next up is the main course breakfast, which is just okay. The Portuguese sausage is tough and quiche mostly tasteless. Even though the menu says it is ""potato crusted quiche with zucchini, sweet corn and cheese"" I think it's just onion and spinach? No cheese. No potato. Not satisfying and not very ""first class"" compared to other first class meals I've enjoyed recently. But I'm hungry so I clean my plate.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

Condiments are typically Hawaiian—ketchup, sure, but also soy sauce and sriracha. Nice touch, but not sure they go with quiche...and no potatoes.

I remember one of the best desserts I've ever had on a plane... a small round pineapple upside down cake served on Hawaiian airlines a few years back. Well, it's now gone and has been replaced by a pineapple and coconut cheesecake that regrettably tastes like the freezer. But the best part about the dessert course is the enormous mug of hot coffee served with it. Very nice and homey.

Don't miss the slideshow at the top of this post for all my photos from this flight!

I'm looking around as I write this post... I quickly realize I'm the only person in first class with a laptop out. I'm the only passenger working. I must remember, I'm on a flight to Hawaii and work is not the priority. Which is probably why Hawaiian has not made the investment in onboard wi-fi because they might not have too many takers. Hmm.

Advertisement Article continues below this ad

After brunch, I take the grand tour of the A330. In economy class, seats are configured 2-4-2. There are seatback screens for movies ($8 each) and a USB port. The plane narrows significantly at the back of the back, and the layout becomes 2-3-2.

There are 68 extra comfort seats onboard with 36 inches of pitch, and 192 regular economy seats with 31 inches.

The best seats in the back are bulkheads and exit rows (11, 14 and 34) which I think are all extra comfort. To me, the best extra comfort seats are those just behind first class in a special enclosed private section of just two rows (11 and 12). The two window seats (11 AB and HJ) in the section are in a very private space with a wall in front and a wall behind. Sort of ""extra-extra comfort.""

For some strange reason, flight attendants asked passengers to close window shades for the entire five-hour flight. This seems strange to me since this is a mid-day flight, but no one seemed to protest—and all windows remained closed in economy and first class until we made our final approach into HNL.

Indoor-outdoor corridors at Honolulu HNL Chris McGinnis

In the last 30 minutes of the flight, attendants passed out bags of Maui sweet onion potato chips and offered passengers pre-mixed ""Koloa Breeze"" cocktails from a bottle. There were no takers.

Arrival in Honolulu was easy and as always I appreciated getting off the plane and walking through the airport's breezy outdoor corridors with gardens and views of palm trees and big jets destined for far away Asian and Pacific island destinations.

Overall, the flight was nearly perfect. Right on time. Nice flight attendants and a comfortable seat, but in-flight dining could use an upgrade. I wish I had time to try out the lie-flat seat for some shut eye, but there was too much to do on this flight...and I had to get this review done :)

Some good news I picked up in my conversations with Hawaiian Air execs: These A330 flights won't be replaced by smaller Airbus A321 flights at major airports like SFO or LAX any time soon. These big birds have big cargo holds, and flying cargo between the mainland and Hawaii is big business for Hawaiian. I did fly back to Oakland from Lihue on Hawaiian's new A321, so stay tuned to TravelSkills for that review in coming weeks.

Aloha!

One of the premier industry events in the industry, Farnborough takes place every even-numbered year, alternating between that other air show granddaddy held in Paris.

Set at Farnborough Airport about 40 miles southwest of London, Farnborough may lack the atmosphere of the French capital, but it won't be short on aviation hoopla. Besides a few awesome airplane fly-bys, expect news on new aircraft and the airlines ordering them and the occasional bit that a company would prefer to slip quietly under the rug.

Watch this: Watch a Boeing 787 showcase incredible acrobatic stunts 02:23

Of course, it's also guaranteed that fierce rivals Boeing and Airbus will try to upstage each other with grand announcements. The latter got an early start Tuesday when it announced new names for a pair of existing airliners with the debut of the Airbus A220 family.

Born out of the 2017 partnership between Airbus and Quebec-based Bombardier, the A220 jets are marketed by Airbus, but designed and built by Bombardier. The A220-100 is the former Bombardier CS100, which first flew in 2013, and the A220-300 is the former C300, which first flew in 2015. (See the gallery below for a look inside at CS300.).

In typical configurations, the aircraft seat 108 and 130 passengers respectively. The CS100 is currently in service with Swiss Airlines and the CS300 flies with Air Baltic and Korean Air. Iin the US, Delta has placed a large order for the CS100 and JetBlue opted for the CS300 this week.

Boeing hasn't dropped major show-related news yet, though it did promise fly-bys of its 737 MAX 7 and 787 aircraft. But last week, the company said it would counter the Airbus-Bombardier alliance by acquiring 80 percent of Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer.

July 10, 2018, © Leeham News.: Airbus launched its new A220 aircraft family today in Toulouse. The event took place at the Airbus Delivery Center at Blagnac airport with the World’s Media invited.

The Bombardier CS100 is now A220-100 and the CS300 is A220-300. The name of the newly branded family was revealed with a flyover of a CS300 , sorry, A220-300 painted in Airbus colors and with the A220-300 name on the side.

The A220 launch

We will come back with more in-depth articles about the A220-100 and A220-300 and how they fit into the Airbus family. For now, here are some pictures with comments from today’s event.

The CSeries CS300 becomes Airbus A220-300. The aircraft was painted in Airbus colors and given its final name a few days before the event.

The A220-300 took off from East Midland airport in the UK at 10.22 CET and made a flyover at Toulouse Airport 12.30, revealing the new colors and branding.

The A220-300 then landed and taxied to the gathered press at the Airbus Delivery Center, waving the Airbus flag from the cockpit emergency escape hatch.

Well parked the flight’s pilots could step out and greet the crowd.

Captain was Andy Litavniks, the Bombardier test pilot who was my Copilot when I test-flew the CS300 A220-300 18 months ago. Andy wore an Airbus shirt and cap so guess he is part of the A220 joint venture now.

Changing times

With the CSeries joining the Airbus camp and Embraer Commercial forming a similar joint venture with Boeing, the civil airliner market goes into a new phase. July 2018 will be a point in history for the airliner industry.

Singapore Airlines has taken delivery of the first of its new “ultralong range” jets that will soon begin flying the world’s longest airline route.

The company ordered seven Airbus A350-900ULRs. The “ULR” – short for “ultralong range” – is the newest variant of Airbus’s A350 widebody jet that first began flying for airlines in 2015.

The airline said Saturday that it will put the new plane into service between Newark Liberty and Singapore on Oct. 11. It restores a route that Singapore dropped in 2013 as it phased out its fuel-guzzling, four-engine Airbus A340s.

""We have pushed the limits with this highly advanced new aircraft to extend long-range flying to new lengths,” Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong said in a statement about the company's partnership with Airbus.

Once it begins, the 9,500-statute mile Newark-Singapore route will become the world’s longest regularly scheduled flight, clocking in with a flight time of nearly 19 hours.

The airline said its first two A350-900ULRs will be used for the Singapore-Newark route, while subsequent ones will be used for Singapore-Los Angeles flights, starting Nov. 2, and for more service on the existing Singapore-San Francisco route. The plan is to have 27 weekly non-stop flights between the U.S. and Singapore by the end of the year.

The A350 was already capable of flying long intercontinental flights, but -- as its name suggests -- the ULR has an even greater range. Airbus says the ULR is capable of flying 9,700 nautical miles (about 11,100 statute miles) while carrying a typical load of passengers and cargo. The typical range of a standard A350-900 is about 8,100 nautical miles (about 9,300 statute miles), according to specifications listed on the Airbus website.

Singapore’s A350-900ULRs will not have any standard economy seats. The airline, regularly lauded as one of the world’s most luxurious carriers, is configuring its new ULR versions of the A350 with 67 lie-flat business-class seats and 94 recliner seats in premium economy.

Singapore Airlines also intends to use its A350 ULRs for a just-announced Los Angeles-Singapore service. Singapore also plans to switch its existing Singapore-San Francisco route from the current A350-900 to the ULR variant of the plane."

The plane is based on the current generation Airbus A330 wide-body airliner.

The A330neo has struggled to find customers of late as Airbus has taken just 224 orders since it went on sale in 2014.

The Airbus sales campaign continues at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow.

The A330-800neo is priced at $259.9 million while the larger A330-900neo costs $296.4 million.

FARNBOROUGH –The Boeing 787 Dreamliner entered service to great fanfare back in 2011. Despite being hampered early in its production life by a series of serious reliability issues, the Dreamliner has since proven itself to be a hot-selling and highly efficient airliner.

In fact, it has come to dominate the small wide-boy market of late. Naturally, Airbus had to answer its rival.

Instead of designing a brand new aircraft from the ground up, Airbus decided to use its current generation A330 as the starting point.

At the 2014 Farnborough International Airshow, Airbus launched the A330neo. Like in the A320neo, ""neo"" stands for new engine option.

However, the A330neo is more than an old plane with a new engine.

To create the neo, Airbus thoroughly updated the A330 airframe, gave it a pair of brand new wings, and state-of-the-art avionics. And yes, there is a pair of fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines.

Airbus is offering the neo in two sizes — the A330-800 and the larger A330-900.

Thus far, Airbus has struggled to find customers of the A330neo. Through may, the European planemaker has just 224 orders for the plane which has been on sale since 2014. In that same period, Boeing racked up more than 400 orders for Dreamliners.

The plane's largest customer is Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia X with 66 on order. The A330neo's only US airline customer is Delta with 25 orders on the books. All 224 orders are for the Dash 900.

In March, Hawaiian Airlines canceled the last remaining order for the A330-800. In its place, the Honolulu-based carrier ordered 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.

In spite of the setbacks, Airbus is pushing forward with its A330neo sales campaign.

The Toulouse, France-based company decided to show off of its A330-900neo prototype at the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow in the livery of the plane's launch customer, TAP Air Portugal.

We were able to take a brief tour of the new Airbus jet on the tarmac in Farnborough.

"Ghosts of JetBlue and Bombardier haunt, but seal, A220 deal - The Air Current","Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvZ2hvc3RzLW9mLWpldGJsdWUtYW5kLWJvbWJhcmRpZXItaGF1bnQtYnV0LXNlYWwtYTIyMC1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the final week of deliberations, Airbus still hadn’t told JetBlue Airways the name of the airplane they might be buying.

But as Tuesday closed with a deal for 60 jets, JetBlue had reshaped its fleet with its original startup partner, Airbus. The airline only two days prior had been told that the Bombardier C Series would become the Airbus A220, dropping the Canadian branding it had worn for more than a decade.

JetBlue’s interest in the plane has stretched years, but the campaign intensified this spring and up until July 1, 2018 (when Airbus took over 50.01% of the program) had represented the last fight between independent Embraer and Bombardier single-aisle jets.

The JetBlue campaign was a picture of an airline eager to think bigger about its future growth, but was stalked by the ambitions of its founder, a near death trade case and an industry reshaped in the campaign’s final days.

And it was an incredibly close fight— right up until the end.

“But that’s why they call it a bake off,” said one top JetBlue executive earlier in the spring. “Two nice cakes.”

But JetBlue had to ponder offers not just from Bombardier and Embraer’s E195-E2, but eventually Airbus, along with Pratt & Whitney and even General Electric as it lobbied to keep the first generation CF34-powered E190 fleet flying as long as it could.

Though behind the scenes, JetBlue leaned toward the larger A220-300 (née CS300) throughout the 15-month long replacement study. Cowen & Company’s Helene Becker on Tuesday called it, “the aircraft JetBlue was destined to select.”

In the end, a preference for the larger A220-300’s transcontinental range, a 40% improvement in fuel burn and maintenance (vs. the E190-E1), delivery timing and the largess of Airbus sweetening the deal at the last minute with A321neo conversions got the A220 over the finish line.

The ghosts of David Neeleman and the ITC

But hanging in the background of the order was a ghost from JetBlue’s past – and a ghost from Bombardier’s – that nearly tipped the deal to incumbent Embraer.

Senior leaders at Bombardier and Pratt & Whitney in the late spring were quietly signaling their confidence in a Canadian win at JetBlue. But by late June frustration and discouragement had set in amongst some in at Bombardier. What had leaned heavily their way had seemingly swung to Embraer. One person at Bombardier close to the campaign estimated that it had been lost.

But why?"

Credit: © Airbus SAS 2018.

Airbus has been evaluating new applications for its A320neo twin-engine jet airliner as a ‘highly-capable and cost-effective’ military platform.

The company intends to use the commercial aircraft as a military transport platform and to carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.

Designated A320M3A, the new military variant would be specifically designed to conduct a wide range of ISR operations such as maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare.

“Based on the company’s A320 airliner family in high-rate production, the new A320neo variant will benefit from being a low-risk aircraft solution.”

The aircraft can be equipped with modular roll-on / roll-off payloads to carry out several airlift missions, including carrying passengers and troops, medical evacuation (medevac), and cargo transport.

The larger host platform of Airbus’ A320M3A model features increased electrical power and improved cooling systems compared with the previously used command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) aircraft.

Based on the company’s A320 airliner family in high-rate production, the new A320neo variant will benefit from being a low-risk aircraft solution.

The aircraft is built on the company’s capabilities in manufacturing military derivatives of its commercial aircraft such as the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), which is currently in use with military services worldwide.

The new engine option version of Airbus’ A320 commercial jetliner offers several advantages such as long range and endurance, the lowest operational and lifecycle costs in its class, and an extensive capability for growth in a fuselage cross-section that is wider than its competitor in the same size category."

Airbus confirms new airline's big order for A220 jets - AL.com,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDcvYWlyYnVzX2NvbmZpcm1zX25ld19haXJsaW5lc19iLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and JetBlue founder David Neeleman made it official Tuesday: Neeleman wants 60 of the A220 jets Airbus plans to build in Alabama for a new startup airline.

It has previously been reported by aerospace news outlets that Neeleman and partners were pitching a new airline, possibly to be named Moxy, and that they were interested in the A220. Airbus is now the majority partner in a venture to build and sell the jets developed by Bombardier; leaders of the two companies have said they plan to add an A220 assembly line to the facility in Mobile where Airbus assembles A320-family jets.

At the Farborough International Airshow near London on Tuesday, Airbus confirmed a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of 60 A220-300 jets. The customer is a new airline whose investors are led by Neeleman, according to information provided by Airbus.

""After years of U.S. airline consolidation, the conditions are improving for a new generation of U.S. airline to emerge, focused on passenger service and satisfaction,"" said David Neeleman, majority investor in the new venture. ""The A220 will enable us to serve thinner routes in comfort without compromising cost, especially on longer-range missions. With deliveries starting in 2021, we will have ample time to assemble a world-class management team and another winning business model.""

""This U.S. airline startup's decision for the A220 as the platform on which to launch their new business model is a testament to the passenger appeal and operating economics of this outstanding aircraft,"" Eric Schulz, Chief Commercial Officer for Airbus, said in the statement. ""This commitment confirms the important role the A220 aircraft now occupies in our Airbus single-aisle portfolio.""

The Airbus news release did not address the question of where the jets will be built, or the timetable for establishing the new Mobile assembly line. Airbus has indicated that it plans to break ground this year and begin delivering aircraft by mid-2020.

However, the order does give Airbus motivation to ramp up production to meet the demand. Currently, A220s are assembled in only one factory, a Bombardier plant in Mirabel, Canada. By comparison, Airbus assembles its popular A320-family planes at four facilities France, China, Germany and the U.S."

European air giant Airbus on Wednesday unveiled a solar-powered drone called Zephyr that will fly at a high altitude and fulfil the same functions as a satellite.

The project was presented at Britain's Farnborough airshow, where Airbus revealed that the Zephyr S took off on July 11 for its maiden flight from Arizona in the United States.

""This maiden flight of the Zephyr S aims to prove and demonstrate the aircraft capabilities,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) has a wingspan of 25 metres (82 feet) and weighs less than 25 kilogrammes (55 pounds).

It can fly at an altitude of 21,000 metres above the weather and conventional air traffic.

Another model planned, the Zephyr T, would have a wingspan of 33 metres.

""The only civil aircraft that used to fly at the altitude was Concorde,"" as well as the military reconnaissance U2 and SR-71 Blackbird planes, Airbus said.

The plan is for the drones to fly for three months in the stratosphere, with a descent that would last around 30 hours.

Zephyr ""is a mix between a satellite and a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) with the capabilities of a satellite and the flexibility of a UAV,"" Jana Rosenmann, head of the drones division at Airbus, told AFP.

The drone is equipped with battery technology that saves energy during the day, releasing it at night.

Seven models are planned to be produced in 2018 and seven more in 2019, Rosenmann said.

The drones will have both military and civilian applications, including maritime surveillance, border patrol missions and forest fire detection.

Britain's defence ministry is the first customer.

Airbus said it intended to collaborate closely with regulatory authorities around the world in the absence of international rules on such drone flights.

The Farnborough air show outside London is an unpredictable inflection point in their aerospace rivalry.

By Dominic Gates / The Seattle Times

SEATTLE — Boeing will show up at next week’s Farnborough International Airshow outside London with more swagger than it has in the past, confident that its business has rarely been better.

Rival Airbus, facing production woes and political turmoil in Europe, is certainly at a more fragile moment in its history. Yet its executive team won’t yield an inch at Farnborough. It will even introduce one of the likely stars of the show: the new 100- to 130-seat A220 — the renamed CSeries jet acquired this month from Bombardier of Canada.

That plane underscores a new divergence in the strategies of the two rivals.

For the past decade, Airbus and Boeing have split the global market roughly in half, with comparable airplanes competing head to head in each size category.

Now, however, Airbus has developed a significant lead in the narrowbody-jet market, while Boeing hopes to solidify its recent advantage in the widebody-jet market.

Furthermore, Boeing is boldly proposing to launch an all-new jet in an entirely new, in-between size and range category.

Boeing’s bright hope is that this plane — it’s referred to as the New Midmarket Airplane or NMA, but many already call it the 797 — will come to dominate a new market of medium-range international routes, including travel across the north Atlantic and within Asia.

To clear the way for sales at the top end of this hitherto-untapped market, Boeing’s sharp-edged sales chief, Ihssane Mounir, seems bent this year on trying to kill Airbus’ newly revamped A330neo before it can gain any sales momentum.

Airbus executives are adamant he won’t succeed.

At Farnborough, which marks an unpredictable inflection point in this aerospace rivalry, Boeing’s newfound aggression will engage with a new untested leadership team at Airbus that’s making its first appearance at an air show.

U.K. in an uproar

As aviation people from around the world gather in London this weekend, they’ll find British society in turmoil.

Reflecting a country split politically down the middle over leaving the European Union, the U.K. government faces an existential crisis after several Tory (Conservative Party) Cabinet members resigned this week over Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit policy.

Airbus Chairman Tom Enders has said publicly in England that the hard border the dissident Cabinet members want — introducing border checks on people and goods — would be catastrophic for Airbus’ business.

Airbus makes its wings in the U.K. and relies on frictionless trade with continental Europe to allow its manufacturing operation to run smoothly.

On Monday, the air show formally opens for business with four days of commercial, business and military-aviation transactions, before the gates open to the public at the end of the week.

The top airplane and aerospace suppliers in the world will tout their products and announce orders. Huge mazelike halls will be lined with exhibits of aviation hardware.

The top companies will entertain customers in “chalets,” prefabricated buildings lined up overlooking the runways and decked out with interiors that can look lavish — thick white carpet, with orchid-laden side tables — despite their very temporary feel.

And each afternoon, there will be a flying display of the latest aircraft.

Britain’s Royal Air Force will fly over its newly delivered F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Boeing will send up a 737 MAX and a 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus will fly its A330neo and its large A350-1000.

Embraer of Brazil, newly embraced by Boeing but with a deal still a long way off, will fly its E2 regional jet that competes with the A220.

And Mitsubishi of Japan will showcase its still-in-flight-test MRJ regional jet, which has been practicing its flying routine at Moses Lake in Central Washington.

Airbus ahead in narrowbody jets

Airbus arrives at Farnborough as its mechanics in Toulouse and Hamburg are still digging out from a buildup of unfinished airplanes caused by engine and cabin-interior supply problems.

Brexit and the growth of nationalism across Europe have cast a pall of uncertainty over the business climate it operates in.

And with Airbus Commercial’s CEO, CFO and sales chief all replaced this year, the top leadership team is new and unproven. Enders, overall CEO of the Airbus Group, is set to retire next spring.

Scott Hamilton, Bainbridge Island-based aviation analyst with Leeham.net, said this sudden “decapitation” — precipitated by disagreement at the top over how to handle a bribery scandal, and the retirement of legendary sales chief John Leahy — has hurt company morale and it will take some time for Airbus “to get its game back.”

And yet, the strategic gap between Airbus and Boeing is most obvious today in the narrowbody, single-aisle market — where Airbus is winning hands down.

Last year, Airbus widened its share of that market to 59 percent on the strength of its large A321neo jet, which has far outstripped its Boeing counterpart in sales.

And at the small end of that airplane category, the introduction at Farnborough of the new A220 will make the Airbus narrowbody-jet advantage even more formidable.

On Tuesday, after announcing the new name for the jet, Airbus revealed the first big order when JetBlue ordered 60 A320-300s. For good measure, the airline also converted 25 of its current A320neo order into orders for the larger A321neo.

Expect more significant A220 orders at the air show.

Moxy Airways, a new startup airline led by JetBlue founder David Neeleman, a Brazilian American who has previously bought only Embraer regional jets, is among those expected to announce an order for the airplane.

Jeff Knittel, the new chief executive of Airbus Americas, said in an interview that the CSeries/A220 acquisition also further strengthens Airbus’ position in the U.S., since it has committed to build another assembly line for the jet in Mobile, Alabama, and start assembling planes by mid-2020.

“We intend ultimately to sell a lot of these airplanes in the U.S. and those airplanes will be produced in Mobile,” Knittel said. “It’s great for the state of Alabama and terrific for the people of Mobile.”

Boeing will have no corresponding small jet available until it finalizes the agreement announced this month with Brazilian jet maker Embraer — late next year at best.

The decision to announce that deal last week, so far ahead of finalizing it, seems to have been prompted by Boeing’s desire to have a response at Farnborough to the A220’s expected success at the show.

Fierce struggle over the A330neo

Still, Farnborough comes at a moment of strength and confidence for Boeing.

As the world’s air traffic continues to grow apace, jet sales are healthy.

With a plentiful cash hoard, the U.S. jet maker is buying up companies in a confident push into aftermarket services.

Its leadership is stable. The stock price has soared.

And Boeing certainly has the upper hand in the widebody, twin-aisle market — the bigger, more profitable aircraft. Last year, Boeing sold three times as many as Airbus.

As of June 30, Boeing this year had 460 firm orders, 141 of them for widebody jets.

Airbus’ total was 206, including 50 widebody jets.

In an interview, Mounir said he feels good about Boeing’s position going into his first Farnborough air show.

He said he’s not worried about the A321neo’s sales lead because the competing 737 MAX 10 has only been on the market since it launched at last summer’s Paris Air Show.

“The A321 did well when there was no MAX 10,” Mounir said. “We now have 420 orders and commitments for that airplane in one year. We like the MAX 10.”

Driving Boeing’s strong widebody sales figures, he said, is both the robust rebound of the air-cargo market and a surge in sales of the 787 Dreamliner.

Boeing’s freighter aircraft, such as the 777F, have a virtual monopoly in the air-cargo market and are expected to be big sellers at Farnborough.

And observers at the air show will watch closely to see if the 787 can continue to take sales away from Airbus’ latest plane, the A330neo, which had its first flight in the fall and is to enter service later this year.

In March, Boeing persuaded Hawaiian Airlines to ditch an A330neo order and switch to the 787. In April, American Airlines placed an order for 47 Dreamliners after deciding against the A330neo.

Just ahead of Farnborough, another worrying sign for Airbus came when AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes left Toulouse unsatisfied after talks with new Airbus sales chief Eric Schulz to finalize and potentially extend a previously announced order for 66 A330neos.

“Everybody regarded that AirAsia A330neo deal as done, ” said Richard Aboulafia, industry analyst with the Teal Group. “Apparently, it’s not.”

Leeham.net’s Hamilton said that if Airbus were to lose AirAsia, a reliably all-Airbus customer, “it would look really bad for the A330neo.”

“I have to believe Eric Schulz will do everything he can to win that order,” he said.

Mounir said the Airbus handicap is that the A330neo is essentially a one-airplane family, while the 787 comes in three sizes. An airline can buy the smallest and easily move up in size as its markets grow.

Airbus’ Knittel insisted that the A330neo sales will pick up when operators of the original A330, with more than 1,200 airplanes in service, need to replace those aircraft.

The A330neo “is an airplane slightly ahead of its time in terms of the replacement cycle, but that will come,” Knittel argued. “When airplanes get in service and when airlines start seeing how well they perform, that’s when you start making sales.”

The NMA influence

This fierce sales struggle over the A330neo suggests one of the stress points where the strategies of Airbus and Boeing are diverging: Boeing’s proposed new NMA, expected to launch next year.

Though no new NMA details are expected to be released at Farnborough, its influence will be felt.

The concept is of a two-airplane family. Each jet will have two aisles, like a widebody jet, making it fast to board and deboard. But it will be smaller and only medium range, carrying 220 to 270 seats and flying about 5,000 nautical miles.

The 206-seater Airbus A321neo, which has a range of 4,000 nautical miles, sits just below this proposed market. And the A330neo fits above it, carrying 287 passengers with a range of 6,550 nautical miles.

Knittel said the Airbus strategy is to serve most of that “middle of the market” with these two existing planes, only stretching and improving the A321neo where needed.

And while Boeing talks of delivering the NMA by 2025, Knittel said, “We’re ready to deliver those airplanes now, as opposed to years from now.”

As Boeing moves to determine if there is enough of a market to justify the roughly $10 billion it’ll take to develop the new jet, one clear tactic has emerged: The A330neo has a slim tally of just 224 firm orders and Boeing is trying to crush it at birth by pricing the rival 787 aggressively.

Aboulafia said the proposed NMA is “a leap of faith.” Should it work, it would fragment international route networks and could lead to sales of 2,000 to 3,000 planes.

“If Boeing couples the NMA with a concerted effort to kill the A330neo, they could own that market,” Aboulafia said.

On the other hand, he said, “The only issue is, at the top end of that market, the A330neo might survive, and at the bottom end, the A321neo could become the A322neo,” meaning a larger, improved version of that popular single-aisle Airbus jet.

Aboulafia points to the advanced wing-manufacturing technology Airbus just acquired from Bombardier: The carbon composite wings are built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, using a new process called Resin Transfer Infusion.

Imagine, he said, a potential A322neo, a stretch of the A321neo with new engines and an A220 wing.

“That would be a killer,” Aboulafia said.

No one knows how this strategic game of duopoly will play out in the years ahead.

At Farnborough, industry analysts will track sales wins for the key aircraft as well as any new hints of Boeing’s commitment to launch the NMA, looking for clues as to how the fortunes of Airbus and Boeing may shift."

Airbus performs world's first automatic air-to-air refuelling contact with large aircraft receiver - Airbus,"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNy1haXJidXMtcGVyZm9ybXMtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWF1dG9tYXRpYy1haXItdG8tYWlyLXJlZnVlbGxpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A acts as receiver from A310 tanker

Madrid, 12 July 2018 – Airbus Defence and Space has followed its earlier achievement in demonstrating Automatic Air-to-Air (A3R) refuelling of a fighter with another world-first – the same operation performed with a large receiver aircraft.



In a joint operation with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which is collaborating with Airbus in development of this pioneering technology, Airbus’ A310 company development tanker performed seven automatic contacts with a RAAF KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, also made by Airbus.

The system requires no additional equipment on the receiver and is intended to reduce refuelling boom operator workload, improve safety, and optimise the rate of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) in operational conditions to maximise aerial superiority. Airbus has begun work towards introducing the system on the current production A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT).

During initial approach of the receiver, boom control is performed by the tanker’s Air Refuelling Operator (ARO) as usual. Innovative passive techniques such as image processing are then used to determine the receiver’s refuelling receptacle position and when the automated system is activated, a fully automated flight control system flies and maintains the boom aligned with the receiver’s receptacle. The telescopic beam inside the boom can be controlled in a range of ways including: manually by the ARO; a relative distance-keeping mode; or full auto-mode to perform the contact.

In the 20 June flight off the southern Spanish coast, the A310 tanker performed the scheduled seven contacts over a two-hour test period.

David Piatti, who again acted as Airbus Test ARO, or “boomer”, on the A310, said: “It was extremely impressive to see how accurately the A3R system tracks the receiver. It can be very useful to be able to refuel another tanker or transport, for example to extend its deployment range or to avoid taking fuel back to base, but it is also a challenging operation and this system has the potential to reduce workload and the risk involved.”

The trial was conducted in conjunction with Test Pilots and Flight Test Engineers from the RAAF’s Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU).

Squadron Leader Lawry Benier, Executive Officer for ARDU, said the RAAF were assisting Airbus Defence & Space on the development of A3R and other technologies to increase the utility of the KC-30A within a battlespace.

“It’s very encouraging to come to Spain and see the progress that’s been made with A3R, and be able to witness it firsthand refuelling our KC-30A,” Squadron Leader Benier said.

“Refuelling large receivers is a role RAAF has conducted extensively on operations and exercises, allowing us to extend the reach and responsiveness of our air mobility fleet, as well as keep surveillance aircraft in the air for longer.”

The aeronautics company rolled out the new look, in which the massive plane now resembles a white beluga whale.

AIRBUS TO CREATE BEDS FOR AIRPLANE CARGO HOLD

The adorable paint job was voted on by Airbus employees, who wanted the design to look more like a whale. Forty percent voted in favor of the animal design, which included bright blue eyes and a smiling black mouth.

So far, those who have seen photos of the plane, unveiled last week in France, have been pleasantly surprised.

“I like the custom paint job that Airbus put on their ‘Beluga XL’ transport plane,” one person wrote on Twitter.

“Love the new Beluga XL,” another tweeted.

The Airbus was originally called an A300-600ST, but it quickly earned its whale nickname because of the uncanny resemblance the plane had to the white beluga whale, with its signature forehead hump.

The BelugaXL, which was designed in 2014 aiming to address the need for larger planes, will enter its cute new look into service in 2019, the brand said in a press release."
