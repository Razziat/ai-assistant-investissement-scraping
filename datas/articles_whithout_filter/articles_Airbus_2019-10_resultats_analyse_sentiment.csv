This new Airbus facility will help zero-emission technologies to take flight - Airbus,"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTEwLXRoaXMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1mYWNpbGl0eS13aWxsLWhlbHAtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtdG8tdGFrZS1mbGlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Ottobrunn, southern Bavaria—about 13 kilometres from Munich, the beginnings of a revolution in aircraft technology are starting to take shape. In just 18 months, a modern, high-tech facility has sprung from the ground in record time.

But this is no ordinary facility: at more than 3,000 m2 , it is the largest test house dedicated exclusively to alternative propulsion systems and fuels in Europe. In fact, NASA in the US is the only other organisation in the world to offer comparable facilities. This means Airbus can now test the latest electric motors and hybrid-electric engines directly on its own premises, and develop its own low-emission alternative propulsion units.

[EAS House] is where we put the engines through their paces. We can test everything from electric motors for unmanned flying taxis to hybrid-electric engines for the commercial aircraft of the future.

Martin Nüsseler, Head of E-Aircraft Systems

Known as the E-Aircraft System House (EAS), this modern test centre is about the size of ten tennis courts. The multi-purpose integration hall will welcome fuselages and wings, propulsion units, cables and avionics—all of which need to be tested.



“This is where we put the engines through their paces,” explains Martin Nüsseler, Head of E-Aircraft Systems. “We can test everything from electric motors for unmanned flying taxis to hybrid-electric engines for the commercial aircraft of the future.”

The EAS House is a €50-million investment with one clear goal: to develop the in-depth expertise on the alternative propulsion technology needed to help the first generation of zero-emission commercial aircraft take to the skies within the 2030s timeframe.

E-Fan X: the flagship project at the EAS House

And that objective is already on the right track. At the EAS House, the E-Fan X is the flagship project. Airbus is developing the E-Fan X to accelerate progress on hybrid-electric technology and to establish the requirements for future certification of zero-emission commercial aircraft.

In early 2020, Rolls-Royce will deliver the electric motor that will replace one of the four gas turbines installed on the test aircraft—a BAe 146. The electric motor will be equipped with 2 MW of power.

Once the electric motor arrives, it will undergo rigorous testing. This starts with mounting the electric motor on one of the EAS test rigs, applying the required sensors and installing cameras to monitor progress. The testing will be extensive but necessary to prove the viability of the electric motor’s capabilities in preparation for the E-Fan X’s first flight, scheduled for 2021.



“Is 2 MW enough power? How will altitude and speed affect this power?” asks Olivier Maillard, E-Fan X Demonstrator Lead. “We need to find solutions to both of these questions, and the EAS House will help us to do so.”

A “tipping point” for zero-emission flight?

For Airbus, the EAS House now stands as a brick-and-mortar example of the company’s commitment to zero-emission flight. In 2010, Airbus embarked on its electrification journey for commercial aircraft—developing the world’s first all-electric, four-engine aerobatic aircraft, Cri-Cri. A number of other key achievements have underscored this journey throughout the years—from the E-Fan’s successful crossing of the English Channel to the launch of the Air Race E electric airplane racing series.



But if the company’s successive electrification projects have helped to gradually change minds on the potential of electric flight, Airbus hopes the EAS House will mark a “tipping point” for the aviation industry to see alternative propulsion as a serious and viable technology that can be widely adopted.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999455213546753}",neutral,0.9999455213546753,0
What Will the Airbus-Boeing Subsidy Dispute Mean for Consumers? - Knowledge@Wharton,"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLndoYXJ0b24udXBlbm4uZWR1L3BvZGNhc3Qva25vd2xlZGdlLWF0LXdoYXJ0b24tcG9kY2FzdC9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXRhcmlmZnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Consumers in the U.S. will end up paying in an escalating battle between the U.S. and the European Union over subsidies enjoyed by their respective aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus, according to experts at Wharton and Syracuse University. Beginning on October 18, the U.S. is set to impose tariffs of 10% on imports from the European Union of large civil aircraft by U.S. airlines, and 25% tariffs on agricultural and other products including Irish and Scotch whiskies, cheeses and olives.

The proposed U.S. tariffs follow a World Trade Organization ruling earlier this month that the EU violated its rules by providing subsidies to Airbus, hurting Boeing. The ruling allows the U.S. to levy $7.5 billion in tariffs on European goods annually. On Monday, the U.S. secured final WTO approval to proceed with its proposed tariffs.

Mary E. Lovely, economics professor at Syracuse University and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, hoped the current dispute would make way for a fairer international trade environment. “I hope it’s the beginning of a broader discussion about the role of industrial subsidies and the willingness of the global system to limit them in the name of creating of a level playing field for trade,” she said.

Both Airbus and Boeing receive indirect subsidies, and it is time both sides accepted that fact, said Wharton management professor Mauro Guillen. “At the end of the day, we all benefit from having two companies that make excellent planes, because aircraft have become more fuel efficient, quieter and have just gotten better over the last 30 or 40 years,” he said. “It would be bad for the airlines and also for consumers if we only had one major producer in the world. I’m happy with that duopoly. This is just another skirmish. It will lead to a few frictions here and there between Europe and the U.S., but hopefully we can move on.”

Lovely and Guillen discussed the broader implications of the aircraft subsidy clash between the EU and the U.S. on the Knowledge at Wharton radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)

“I hope it’s the beginning of a broader discussion about the role of industrial subsidies and the willingness of the global system to limit them in the name of creating of a level playing field for trade.” –Mary E. Lovely

An Interwoven Global Supply Chain

Aircraft components are sourced from all over the world, and no one country has the wherewithal to manufacture planes without depending on global supply chains, both Lovely and Guillen emphasized. In fact, the U.S. Trade Representative has chosen to levy tariffs on imports of Airbus airplanes, but not on imports of parts, Lovely pointed out, adding that some of those parts go to the Airbus assembly plant in Alabama. With an interwoven global economy, “this desire by governments [to have production done] in their own country is extremely short-sighted,” she said. “[That view] doesn’t see the benefits for consumers that Mauro was talking about; it doesn’t see the necessity of having vigorous competition in the industry, and it doesn’t see the value of global supply chains.”

Guillen referred to a chart showing how the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is put together not entirely from components made in the U.S. “The horizontal stabilizer in the back of the plane is made in Italy … the engines in the U.K., parts of the fuselage in Japan, the entry doors in France, the landing gear also in the U.K.; the container for the engines in Canada, and parts of the wing in Korea and Japan,” he said. “So, it’s not really a 100% U.S. plane. If you go to an Airbus, it’s the same story.”

Airbus has tried to make its case against the imminent tariffs around the imperative of a global supply chain. “[The] potential consequences of such tariffs would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only U.S. airlines, but also U.S. jobs, suppliers and air travelers,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury stated. Close to 40% of Airbus’s aircraft-related procurement comes from U.S. aerospace suppliers, he noted. “This U.S. supply chain supports 275,000 American jobs in 40 states through spending that has totaled $50 billion in the last three years alone.”

Focus on Consumer Interests

Against that backdrop, Guillen said “it is important to try to avoid populist arguments about trade, and try to see if we can be a little bit more rational and especially think about the consumer, and what is best for the consumer.”

Lovely noted that consumers will eventually pay in the fallout of the subsidy dispute between Airbus and Boeing. Delta Air Lines will take a direct hit from the 10% tariff on aircraft imports. Delta described the 10% tariff as “an unfair tax on U.S. consumers and companies” in a statement to FlightGlobal, an online publication on aviation and aerospace. The airline has 246 Airbus aircraft on order, which are produced and assembled in Europe and would be subject to the additional tariff.

“What that means is Delta is going to pay the entire tariff, and that that is going to be passed on to passengers,” said Lovely. Delta hopes for a resolution, though. “We hope that the [Trump] administration and the EU are able to resolve this 15-year trade dispute in a manner that respects existing contractual rights,” the company stated.

Getting Pragmatic about Subsidies

Lovely said it’s hard to know the precise amount of subsidies that governments on either side bestow, “because many subsidies are hidden.” In the U.S., subsidies are implicit in Department of Defense contracts to Boeing that allow Boeing to innovate and create new technology that they can then deploy in their commercial aircraft, Lovely noted. In fact, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) acknowledged state-level subsidies to Boeing. “The WTO found that only a single Washington State tax measure that provided Boeing with additional pricing flexibility was inconsistent with WTO rules,” the USTR said in its statement on the latest WTO ruling.

Some types of subsidies are readily acceptable. The EU’s use of special funds to try to develop less developed parts of the union, or regional subsidies “are OK, [since they] don’t target particular industries,” Lovely said.

“At the end of the day, we all benefit from having two companies that make excellent planes….” –Mauro Guillen

However, a broader discussion is necessary because there isn’t enough specificity within WTO rules on what subsidies are acceptable, Lovely said. WTO member countries had years ago agreed to limit direct export subsidies. “[But] it doesn’t cover [actions] that may give firms a big boost like reduced taxes, access to land, governments preparing sites for factories, or even talent subsidies,” she said.

Governments have good reasons to boost development in certain regions to help them overcome handicaps they may face, and therefore, it would be hard to reach an accord over those subsidies, she added.

“We all need to be realistic here,” said Guillen. He pointed out that it is expensive to develop new types of aircraft, and that everybody benefits from those efforts. “Sometimes, subsidies are needed the same way that subsidies are needed for train transportation,” he added. “The airline industry is also subsidized, and municipalities and governments invest in airports.” He thought the EU and the U.S. “should calm down a little bit, and agree on some basic rules [over subsidies].”

Guillen described the issue as “more of a distributional one … either we pay for the development of [aircraft manufacturing technology] through our airline tickets or we pay for it through general taxation in some indirect way.”

The China Factor

The stakes get bigger with China emerging as a potential rival to Boeing with its nascent aircraft manufacturing company. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China has built two jets so far, according to a BBC report. Guillen noted that China is subsidizing its aircraft industry, and that would perhaps make the industry a bit too crowded. “I’m not sure that there is room in the global market for three large producers of aircraft,” he said, pointing out that Boeing acquired the ailing McDonnell Douglas in 1996.

Lovely added that as the aircraft manufacturing industry would change with China’s entry, it is important that the EU and the U.S. end their “unnecessary fight, and look to discipline industrial subsidies through multilateral negotiations.”

“Maybe the U.S. is counting on all of those tractors being driven down the Champs-Elysees in Paris and causing some traffic jams.” –Mauro Guillen

A Costly Dispute

The EU has said that in its parallel case alleging illegal subsidies for Boeing, it would have the right to impose countermeasures against the U.S. Even ahead of that expected ruling, the EU is considering revoking a 2006 settlement with the U.S. over tax exemptions used by Boeing and other U.S. companies known as foreign-sales corporations, the Wall Street Journal reported. Such a move could affect some $4 billion worth of U.S. exports, but also risks unraveling decades of similar trade settlements. “The mutual imposition of countermeasures, however, would only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time,” the EU statement added.

According to Lovely, as the U.S. and the EU battle it out with tit-for-tat actions on tariffs, the casualty will be competition. “We each have our own domestic champion, our own local monopolist, who’s been forced to play in a world with two players so that they build better aircraft, hopefully at lower prices,” she added. “But now we’re giving them more space to exercise their monopoly power.” What is immediately visible to the general public is the ability of the U.S. or the EU to retain more jobs, she said. “What they don’t see is the impact on productivity, quality of the aircraft, and ultimately the benefit to the passenger.”

Olives, wines, cheeses and other agricultural products will take the collateral damage of the broader fight over aircraft manufacturing subsidies. “There’s a lot of symbolism there,” said Guillen, adding that agricultural interests could be expected to protest the proposed U.S. tariffs on those imports from the EU. “Maybe the U.S. is counting on all of those tractors being driven down the Champs-Elysees in Paris and causing some traffic jams.”

Guillen advised both sides to focus on trying to find peace instead of trying to persist with the issue of subsidies for aircraft manufacture. “The EU and the U.S. should be agreeing on these matters as opposed to fighting them out, especially over such a long period of time,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9958266615867615}",neutral,0.9958266615867615,0

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 26 and 71 commercial jets in September 2019, compared to 87 and 69 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. With just 302 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 266 shipments behind last year’s total for the first three quarters of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 571 jets from January to September, compared to 503 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have taken a severe hit since the two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Boeing decided in March to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. The crashes were with a high degree of certainty caused by the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which suddenly activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In September, Boeing delivered two 737NGs. Boeing is still producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month and thereby building up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and was planning a further increase to 57 per month from June of this year. Producing the 737 MAX at a reduced rate will allow the company to prioritize additional resources to focus on returning the 737 MAX to flight. In April, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established a Boeing 737 MAX Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) comprising a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities. Since then, Boeing has worked with the FAA and the JATR and has tested updates to its 737 MAX software during hundreds of flights.

On September 19, Boeing hosted FAA Administrator Steve Dickson at its narrowbody assembly facilities in Renton and Seattle. Steve Dickson spent time in the 737 MAX simulator and held discussions with senior Boeing leaders. On September 25, Boeing announced the creation of a permanent Aerospace Safety Committee of the Board of Directors. Boeing also presented its recommendations from a five-month independent review of its policies and processes for airplane design and development. On September 26, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) presented its findings and recommendations to the FAA, criticizing Boeing for failing to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its 737 MAX safety assessment.

On September 30, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg announced that Boeing is approaching the “endgame” of preparing the 737 MAX to return to service. Currently, the company is fine-tuning a software upgrade for the MAX’s flight-control computers in its simulation lab. According to Muilenburg, this is the final hurdle before the FAA determines if the ban can be lifted.

On October 11, the JATR submitted its observations, findings, and recommendations. In its report, the JATR criticizes both Boeing and the FAA for how they assessed and approved the design of the 737 MAX’s automated flight-control system.

Exactly when the 737 MAX will return to service remains unclear, however. Boeing’s best estimate is that the jet could be approved “early in the fourth quarter.” The largest operator of the grounded jet, Southwest Airlines, has canceled all 737 MAX flights through early January. In total, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAX jets to date. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. In September, Boeing also delivered one 747, four 767s, seven 777s, and 12 787s. Boeing recently raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft. Boeing has handed over 113 787s year-to-date. The company delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. In connection with Boeing’s second quarter 2019 earnings report, CEO Dennis Muilenburg announced that Boeing plans to increase 777F production due to 777X delays, but did not disclose by how much.

In September, Airbus delivered seven A220s, 48 A320s (8 CEO / 40 NEO), four A330s, and 12 A350s. Airbus recently increased the official A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month and is targeting an additional raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Airbus has delivered 77 A350s year-to-date, having shipped 93 A350s in 2018 – up from 78 in 2017 – and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month, but a date has yet to be announced. With the ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate, Airbus has nearly eliminated Boeing’s deliveries lead in recent years. Following the tragic 737 MAX events, Airbus is almost certain to deliver more aircraft than Boeing in 2019.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing had a mixed month in September, logging 25 gross orders. They were a combination of 767 and 787 widebody jets, as well as one 737 MAX narrowbody (23 cancellations => net of two). Boeing’s September bookings included 15 767-2Cs for the U.S. Air Force’s KC-46 Tanker program as well as eight 787-10s for Air New Zealand, a 737 MAX for a bizjet customer, and a single 767-300F for an undisclosed customer. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 169 gross orders (253 cancellations => -84 net new orders). For full-year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

In September, Airbus booked 41 gross orders and reported nine cancellations, resulting in 32 net new orders. Undisclosed customers ordered a mix of 14 A220s, while AerCap ordered five A320neos. Another undisclosed customer placed an order for 10 A321neos. Finally, Air Asia X firmed up an order for 12 A330-900s. For 2019 to date, Airbus reports 303 gross orders (176 cancellations => net of 127). Of these cancellations, 31 were due to Emirates’ decision earlier this year to reduce its A380 order book. This subsequently forced Airbus to announce that it will cease A380 production in 2021. In 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race since Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On September 30, Airbus’ backlog was 7,133 jets, of which 6,203, or 87 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. The company’s all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets was set in December 2018. By the end of September 2019, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,705 aircraft, of which 4,592, or 80 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.9 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.1 years. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as orders divided by deliveries, is negative because cancellations have outpaced orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.22. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93. In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

New Airbus Long-Term Demand Forecast

On September 18, Airbus released an updated long-term demand forecast calling for 39,000 new aircraft to be built over the next 20 years. According to Airbus, the global passenger and freighter aircraft fleet is set to more than double from nearly 23,000 today to almost 48,000 by 2038, with traffic growing at 4.3 percent annually. This demand will result in a need for 550,000 new pilots and 640,000 new technicians.

2019 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology. Among many other features, Platinum provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2019, Forecast International’s analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 727 and 867 large commercial jets, respectively. The forecast 2019 total for Boeing was 904 prior to the second 737 MAX crash and the subsequent grounding of the fleet and temporary cut in the production rate. These are the latest “live” forecast figures (adjusted frequently by FI analysts as new information comes in). These figures exclude militarized variants of commercial platforms such as Boeing’s P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 and KC-767 tankers, and C-40; and Airbus’ A330 MRTT tanker.

Prior to the second 737 MAX crash, Boeing announced, in connection with the release of its 2018 earnings report in late January, that it was targeting between 895 and 905 commercial jet deliveries in 2019, a 12-13 percent increase from 2018. Boeing has yet to announce a revised figure and is likely awaiting the 737 MAX’s return to service before providing updated guidance. On February 14, Airbus announced that it aims for 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2019, equal to a 10-11 percent increase from 2018.

Note: Boeing 777-300ER orders include one 777-200LR. The 777-300ER backlog includes two 777-200LRs.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are taking the aviation world by storm. Airlines can't get enough of these fuel-efficient jets to fly some of their longest routes — and airline passengers can't get enough of them, either.

But do you know how to spot the difference between the two jets? They are both about the same size: 200-feet long with seating capacity of around 300 passengers (depending on variant). They are both much lighter than their predecessors because they are made of composite materials instead of heavier aluminum. But that's where the similarities end.

Here's some advice on spotting these gorgeous new planes...and distinguishing between the two.

The cockpit windows of an A350 wrap slightly more on either side, so much so that most airlines highlight them with black paint giving them, what many call a ""bandit mask"" or ""raccoon eyes."" (I think it looks like the jet is wearing sunglasses.) The outer edges of the cockpit windows on the A350 are rounded as well, which is unique. On the Dreamliner, the outer edge of cockpit windows comes to a point, and they are not outlined in black. (Caveat: Air Canada has a new 787 with raccoon eyes, too. See slideshow at top!)

Next, look at the passenger windows. The B787 has windows that are both taller and wider than on the A350 and other jets. But the giveaway is on the aircraft doors: The A350 has small, round porthole-style windows on the aircraft doors. Dreamliner doors have tall, narrow windows with rounded top/bottom edges.

Wings:

You should also look to the wings to help distinguish between the two planes. The wings of the B787 slant upward, and when you look at the plane with a head-on view, it is easy to notice. It's also very clear that the wings bow up when looking out at them during flight. (See slideshow)

The tips of the wings on the A350 are uniquely curly while the B787 has raked wingtips that angle up slightly and point away from the plane.

Tip & Tail:

Both planes have a somewhat pointy nose but the Dreamliner's is slightly wider. If you look closely at the plane's side profile, the A350 has a slight angle between the cockpit windows and the nose (giving it a sort of ""beak"") while the B787 is completely straight from the top of the cockpit windows to the tip of the nose.

The tail cone of each plane is slightly different, too with the A350 tail angling up from underneath and the Dreamliner more conical in form. Don't miss the slideshow at the top of this post!

At SFO, you'll see A350's from Asiana, French Bee, Singapore, Airlines, and Cathay Pacific. Airlines flying the 787 Dreamliner at SFO include: China Southern, El Al, Japan Airlines, KLM, Korean Air, Qantas, United and Virgin Atlantic. At San Jose, ANA, British Airways and Hainan Airlines fly Dreamliners.

Has Airbus fixed midair refueling problems with the F-15 jet? - Defense News,"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxOS8xMC8yMi9oYXMtYWlyYnVzLWZpeGVkLW1pZGFpci1yZWZ1ZWxpbmctcHJvYmxlbXMtd2l0aC10aGUtZi0xNS1qZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Airbus has developed changes to the software that controls the A330 tanker boom specifically for midair refueling of the Boeing F-15 Eagle. The modification, known as boom flight control law, was coded in response to difficulties encountered during flight trials, and the update adds another receiver type to the list of aircraft certified for refueling from the tanker.

Airbus told Defense News that the need for a new boom control law came to light during flight trials between an A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport and U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jets. Observers noticed midair refueling between the two aircraft was more difficult than other receivers due to the F-15 receptacle’s asymmetric design and “the associated aerodynamics effects"" near the receptacle.

The new boom control law on the A330 MRTT provides the boom operator with an improved and smoother way to perform the contact, an Airbus Defence and Space spokesman told Defense News.

He added that the software modification for the A330 MRTT’s aerial refueling boom system, or ARBS, called Update III Loop 6.1, was certified in 2018 following flight tests between the MRTT and an unidentified operator’s F-15s during the development and certification phases to assess and validate the behavior of the new boom control laws.

The boom and receptacle method of air-to-air refueling is used on aircraft such as the F-15, Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Boeing’s B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer, in which a boom operator on board the tanker maneuvers and plugs the refueling boom into a receptacle mounted on the receiver aircraft. The refueling receptacle is usually mounted along the receiver aircraft’s longitudinal centerline, although in some aircraft like the F-15, the receptacle is offset to one side.

This refueling method allows higher fuel transfer rates compared to the alternative probe and drogue approach, and the former method is usually used by the U.S. Air Force and larger receiver aircraft with higher onboard fuel capacity. Like many modern tanker aircraft, the MRTT is capable of supporting both refueling methods.

Why the F-15?

The Airbus spokesman did not go into detail about midair refueling difficulties with the F-15. However, an unclassified Republic of Singapore Air Force document seen by Defense News noted that during flight tests with its F-15SG aircraft, the receivers experienced “a left roll tendency was observed in the center and right side of the boom envelope” and that when the boom was disconnected between tanker and receiver, the fighter jet “may yaw left (up to approximately 2 [degrees]) into the boom as the boom was flying up and away from the receptacle”.

The standards-related document also said aircrew “qualitatively assessed that the workload was minimal to moderate and was manageable,” adding that the F-15’s tendency to roll while on the MRTT’s boom meant that it required “a slight constant right aileron and/or rudder inputs to maintain in position.”

This left roll/yaw phenomenon corresponds with what Defense News previously reported: During refueling trials conducted by an Australian MRTT in 2015 with U.S. Air Force receiver aircraft, the boom at certain flight parameters tended to move too close to and run the risk of contact with the F-15’s canopy.

Singapore’s F-15SGs have received category 3 clearance for refueling from the MRTT, though some restrictions still apply, including that the MRTT ARBS version “must be or later than Upgrade III Loop 6.1” and the F-15SG “shall not carry stores” on the two forward left weapons stations, known as LC3 and LC6.

In addition, MRTT air-to-air refueling operations must only be carried out with the ARBS in F-15 flight control law mode. The MRTT ARBS has two other control laws: “light and “heavy” depending on the weight of the receiver aircraft. These boom control laws are used by modern fly-by-wire refueling booms to improve handling characteristics during the different phases of air-to-air refueling.

Category 3 clearance is the highest of three levels between tanker and receiver aircraft, and it is considered a low-risk clearance due to comprehensive compatibility testing between both aircraft, which includes flight testing across a range of performance parameters.

What other countries are affected?

The Singaporean document was uploaded to the website of NATO’s Joint Air Power Competence Centre, alongside that of several other coalition and friendly countries such the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Japan. Such documents are used to facilitate multinational interoperability between tanker and receiver aircraft.

As of early October, Singapore has received four of six A330 MRTTs it has on order. Its military operates a fleet of F-15SG multirole fighters used by two Singapore-based squadrons, and the fighter jets participate in U.S.-based training. Saudi Arabia and South Korea also operate the A330 MRTT and the F-15, with the former operating both types since 2012.

Airbus describes the Loop 6.1 update as the baseline for all new production aircraft, and it’s likely South Korea and France, which received their first A330 MRTT aircraft after Singapore, will operate tankers with the boom control update.

Airbus also says the update is available for MRTT operators upon request, and a spokesperson from Australia’s Defence Department told Defense News that all of its MRTTs, which are locally known as the KC-30A, “have upgraded boom flight control laws (version Loop 5.2 to 6.1), which better accommodate refueling with the F-15 Eagle.”

Australia was the first country to operate the MRTT and has carried out extensive refueling trials with other coalition receiver aircraft. In addition to F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, Australia’s MRTTs have also been certified to refuel coalition aircraft such as the U.S. Air Force’s B-1 bomber and the A-10 close-air support plane, the French Rafale fighter jet, and the Indian Sukhoi Su-30 Flanker, among others.

Australia also wants to add the F-15 to that list. An Australian test pilot told reporters at the Avalon Airshow in Australia this year that there are plans to conduct trials with Singapore’s F-15SGs as well as Japanese F-15J and F-2 fighters.

Faury looks to transform Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8xMC8zMC9mYXVyeS1sb29rcy10by10cmFuc2Zvcm0tYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Guillaume Faury has been the chief executive officer of Airbus Group since April 1. In this exclusive interview, he looks back on his first six months and ahead for the future of the company. This is part 1 of two parts. Part 2 will appear soon.

Oct. 30, 2019, © Leeham News: Guillaume Faury assumed his office as chief executive officer of the Airbus Group at a time when the company was trying to emerge from years-long scandals over bribery and corruption probes and the industry was only beginning to reel from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.

Now, he’s focused on guiding Airbus in the future through a series of transformations to put the scandals behind the company, change production for the future and prepare for new airplanes that inevitably must be designed.

Becoming CEO

Faury’s been with Airbus for 20 years, surrounding a four-year stint with Peugeot from 2009-2013 as EVPO of Research and Development. He was named president of Airbus Commercial in February 2018. He previously was president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters from 2013-2018.

He succeeded CEO Tom Enders, who was not going to be given another term as part of the fallout of the numerous government investigations into past practices at Airbus involving third parties for aircraft sales, bribery and corruption allegations.

Although Enders and CFO Harald Wilhelm initiated the probes and reported the problems to the governments, they along with many others had to go as Airbus tried to limit the damage.

Compliance going forward

Compliance, obviously, emerges from the years of investigations by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and governments in Germany, France and the US. Faury is continuing the Airbus efforts toward compliance.

“We want to be known as a company that relies very strong pillars of quality, safety, integrity and compliance,” he said in an interview Oct. 17 with LNA.

Faury doesn’t have any indication when the investigations will be wrapped up. What’s important, he said, is that Airbus emerges in a leadership position on compliance.

“We had three main things to do: full cooperation with the authorities, which we have done from day one. The second thing was to change a number of people in the company to emerge with a team that was not affected by what happened. The third one was to put in place a compliance system is state of the art. This is what we are doing. We have made a lot of progress and therefore what we had to do in that situation is something we are prepared to moving forward,” he said.

“It’s not only the mindset, it’s about the culture, the training and the know-how. It’s values. It’s also the way we work together in transformations. It’s the way we want to contribute.”

Production transformation

Faury is also focused on improving the Airbus production system. Airbus, Faury said, has fallen behind in some areas.

“There are transformational challenges we have tried to clarify,” he said. The products and production systems need to change. The synergies, the know-how, the automation, the robotization of very large and complex objects like planes is kicking in and will make a big difference for the next generation of airplanes,” he said.

“The transformational change is where we need to do more.”

He says Airbus is far ahead of Boeing in the area of digitalization, an initiative begun under Enders.

“I would differentiate manufacturing techniques and digital, because right or wrong, my perception is that we are ahead of Boeing very significantly in digital. How do I measure it? The A350 program management, certification, production, industrialization, entry into service has been very well managed, and it’s mainly because of the 3D approach of the product,” he said.

“And when I look at Skywise, I think we are in a unique position in the industry, and I don’t see Boeing doing something similar. We have really understood the value of big data, how to manage them, how to put them on a platform. We are now close to 100 airlines having joined the program, putting their data on that platform. We are moving forward as well in terms of 3D into DDMS, okay, which is digital design, manufacturing and services.”

Skywise is an Airbus program that, among other things, provides predictive maintenance and notifies the airplane crew and ground maintenance of specific issues that need to be addressed as the plane arrives at the gate. This cuts time to identify and fix problems that pop up during flights and reduces delays and costs to the airlines.

“The comparison with Boeing in my view is not 350 versus others, because if we would do this comparison, I think we are ahead,” he said. “I think what Boeing has done on the NG, on the production system of the 737 NG was a bolder approach to the product and the production system than what we’ve been doing in Airbus. But I have a feeling with what we are doing in Hangar 245, with the automation we have put in Broughton, with the FAL 4 in Hamburg, we are having a trajectory with maybe more speed. So I think it’s not easy to compare.”

Boeing adopted a moving production line for the NG that dramatically increased efficiencies and lowered costs. There were some painful times when the supply chain failed to keep up, but today Boeing has the ability to produce 70 737s a month through the Renton factory—an extraordinary efficiency for one building.

Airbus’ A320 production platform in Toulouse is less automated than those in Hamburg, where a new highly automated line opened last month.

Converging automation

Boeing is engaged in a multi-year shift to a host of advanced manufacturing techniques under the code name Black Diamond. The plan has been to converge all these techniques for the first time at Boeing Commercial Airplanes into the New Midmarket Airplane (NMA). The time and cost reduction is an important part of the NMA business plan, which hasn’t closed after several years of effort.

Now, with the 737 MAX grounding that so far has cost Boeing $9.2bn—a figure that is certain to rise—it’s questionable whether the NMA will ever get off the ground. (NMA off the table in 2020 and maybe entirely, Oct. 21, 2019.)

“We share the same perception that the NMA was the convergence of the project’s initiative to go full digital for the product and the production system” Faury said. “Call it digital twin. We use this expression as well. We see that they have used some of the building blocks of previous experiences.”

“On the NMA itself, we think it is a very difficult segment, given the fact they have the 737 and the 787. It’s a very narrow segment. We have placed our planes already. They have to catch up now. We are happy they are coming late to the party.”

Environmental sensitivity

Airbus years ago began upping its game in the environmental arena. Faury wants a greater push going forward.

“The third [transformation] is the speed of change of society, of the states, of the regulation, of the expectations of customers, of people, of our own employees. That shows we need to be much faster and taking things much more seriously with the environment and the de-carbonization of aviation,” he says.

Airbus plans upgraded but non-ULR A350-1000 for Project Sunrise - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLXVwZ3JhZGVkLWJ1dC1ub24tdWxyLWEzNTAtMTAwMC1mb3ItcHJvamVjdC1zdW5yaXNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has never officially confirmed that its entrant for the Qantas Project Sunrise competition, for nonstop flights from Sydney to New York and London, is the A350-1000 — until today. Speaking to Runway Girl Network from Toulouse, A350 head of product marketing Marisa Lucas-Ugena confirmed that Airbus is submitting the A350-1000 for configuration, and not in an extra-fuel-tank ultra-long-range ULR subtype either.

“We are responding to the challenge with the A350-1000, which is already an extremely capable airplane. In 2022 it will be capable of flying 380 passengers, almost, for 8700nm,” Lucas-Ugena told RGN. “In 2022 the developments that we are working on on the airplane on the slightly higher maximum takeoff weight than what we have in service will bring it to that range.”

Crucially, “to get to that number we do not need extra fuel tanks. We can cover that distance with that payload with the tanks that we have available today,” Lucas-Ugena explained. “The MTOW is adding additional capability for the airplane to carry more payload or more fuel, depending on what you’re after. If it’s more range it’s more fuel, if it’s more payload then it’s more payload, independently of adding additional fuel tanks or anything.”

Airbus was cagey about revealing the exact improvements it is making to the A350-1000 in order to certify additional MTOW, but this sort of incremental addition would be a normal part of aircraft in-service development as conservative planning assumptions and early manufacturing processes are tested and revised in-service.

“There are some slight changes on the airplane,” Lucas-Ugena said. “It’s a typical evolution of our product… at the beginning of its life. We are bringing to the surface the potential this airplane has. The original range capability of the airplane was around 8000nm: that was the headline figure that we had pre-flight. That was the target we had for this airplane. We have a phenomenal potential, and what we’re getting in 2022 is the more than 700 nautical miles more range than we had marketed initially.”

This 375 passengers for 8700nm range number will just about meet the Sydney-New York leg of Project Sunrise, but will not, however, cover Sydney-London. On a Great Circle routing, Sydney-London is 9177nm, rather more than JFK-Sydney at 8646nm, according to gcmap.com. Of course, westbound headwinds and the usual requirement for reserves, especially over the Pacific, will require additional fuel and thus reduced payloads.

That reduced payload is not necessarily a dealbreaker for Project Sunrise, however. If Airbus is giving a 375-passenger A350-1000 an 8700nm range, that is a substantially heavier payload than any A350-1000 operator apart from ultra-dense Air Caraïbes.

It is very hard to imagine Qantas putting more seats on their A350-1000 than the three class (business, premium economy, economy) configurations on British Airways (331 seats), Cathay Pacific (334 seats) or Virgin Atlantic (335 seats). Even the two-class Qatar Airways Qsuite business/economy configuration has only 327 seats.

(Cathay Pacific already operates the A350-1000 on Washington Dulles-Hong Kong, a 7085nm journey.)

Airbus did not provide details such as LOPA (layout of passenger accommodations) seat maps to show how it would get to 375 passengers while maintaining business class between doors 1 and 2, although Lucas-Ugena suggested that was the planning assumption, combined with four rows of premium economy. She also confirmed that the 375 number does not require ten-abreast economy class seating on the A350.

As some form of comparison, Qantas offers 236 seats on its three-class Boeing 787-9 aircraft already flying Perth-London and soon Brisbane-Chicago. Virgin Atlantic’s 787-9, which is also three-class, offers 258.

Given the high premium cabin expectations for Project Sunrise, therefore, one could imagine an A350-1000 seating around 300-320 passengers, depending on whether business class extends behind doors two, as it does on British Airways.

Clearly, Airbus thinks that will be sufficient for Project Sunrise. Will Qantas?

This marks one of Airbus’ largest aircraft orders ever with a single airline operator.

This latest IndiGo order comprises a mix of A320neo, A321neo and A321XLR aircraft. This will take IndiGo’s total number of A320neo Family aircraft orders to 730.

“This order is an important milestone, as it reiterates our mission of strengthening air connectivity in India, which will in turn boost economic growth and mobility. India is expected to continue with its strong aviation growth and we are well on our way to build the world’s best air transportation system, to serve more customers and deliver on our promise of providing low fares and a courteous, hassle free experience to them,"" said Ronojoy Dutta, Chief Executive Officer of IndiGo.

“We are delighted that IndiGo, one of our early launch customers for the A320neo, continues to build its future with Airbus, making IndiGo the world’s biggest customer for the A320neo Family,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “We are grateful for this strong vote of confidence as this order confirms the A320neo Family as the aircraft of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets.” He added: “We are pleased to see our aircraft allowing IndiGo to take full advantage of the predicted growth in Indian air travel.”

""We were believers in IndiGo from day one and are thrilled to be able to perpetuate this most fruitful partnership,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “IndiGo has brilliantly demonstrated the relevance of the A320neo for leading low cost operators, and the A321neo – and now the A321XLR – provide our operators with the logical next step in cost efficiency, passenger comfort and market coverage.”

“We are pleased to partner yet again with Airbus for our next batch of Airbus A320neo Family aircraft. The fuel-efficient A320neo family aircraft will allow IndiGo to maintain its strong focus on lowering operating costs and delivering fuel efficiency with high standards of reliability. The choice of engine manufacturer for this order will be made at a later date,” said Riyaz Peermohamed, Chief Aircraft Acquisition and Financing Officer of IndiGo.

IndiGo is among the fastest growing carriers in the world. Since its first A320neo aircraft was delivered in March 2016, its fleet of A320neo Family aircraft has grown into the world’s largest with 97 A320neo aircraft, operating alongside 128 A320ceos.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. The aircraft will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor jets.

Airbus has inaugurated its highly automated fuselage structure assembly line for A320 Family aircraft in Hamburg, showcasing an evolution in Airbus’ industrial production system.

With a special focus on manufacturing longer sections for the A321LR, the new facility features 20 robots, a new logistics concept, automated positioning by laser measurement as well as a digital data acquisition system. These will further support Airbus’ drive to improve both quality and efficiency while bringing an enhanced level of digitalisation to its industrial production system.

“By embracing some of the latest technologies and processes, Airbus has begun its journey to set new standards in A320 Family production. This new fuselage structure assembly line is an essential enabler for the A320 Family ramp-up. Increasing the level of automation and robotics enables faster, more efficient manufacturing while keeping our prime focus on quality,” said Michael Schoellhorn, Airbus Chief Operating Officer. “Given the enormous success of the A320 Family and the order backlog, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure our production system can match the excellence of our products and that we are able to satisfy our customers’ needs for our single-aisle aircraft.” He added: “A high level of trust and investment has been placed in our people and factories in Hamburg. We now need to deliver in line with our commitments made to customers while ensuring overall competitiveness.”

For the initial section assembly, Airbus is using a modular, lightweight automated system, called “Flextrack”, with eight robots drilling and counter-sinking 1,100 to 2,400 holes per longitudinal joint. In the next production step, 12 robots, each operating on seven axes, combine the centre and aft fuselage sections with the tail to form one major component, drilling, counter-sinking, sealing and inserting 3,000 rivets per orbital joint.

Besides the use of robots, Airbus is also implementing new methods and technologies in material and parts logistics to optimise production, improve ergonomics and shorten lead times. This includes the separation of logistics and production levels, demand-oriented material replenishment as well as the use of autonomous guided vehicles.

The Hamburg structure assembly facility is responsible for joining single fuselage shells into sections, as well as final assembly of single sections to aircraft fuselages. Aircraft parts are equipped with electrical and mechanical systems before eventually being delivered to the final assembly lines in France, Germany, China and the U.S.

Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, the efficient A320neo Family which includes the A321, incorporates the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver more than 15% fuel and CO2 savings from day one and 20% by 2020 as well as a 50% noise reduction. To date, the A320neo Family has captured more than 6,500 orders from over 100 customers.

Airbus A220s ordered to slow down over engine incidents - Tech Xplore,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwcy1pbmNpZGVudHMuaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwcy1pbmNpZGVudHMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Swiss briefly grounded its A220 fleet earlier this month after several in-flight incidents with engines

The Airbus A220 should no longer use full power at high altitudes, Canadian and European air safety regulators have announced following several incidents with their engines, including one in which pieces came off in-flight.

In an emergency airworthiness directive issued over the weekend by Transport Canada and also transmitted by the EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on Monday, airlines operating the aircraft are ordered to not exceed 94 percent of maximum output while above 29,000 feet.

The statement said the directive was issued following ""several occurrences of engine in-flight shutdowns"" with A220s operated by Air Canada, but there have also been several incidents with flights operated by Lufthansa's subsidiary Swiss.

During one Swiss flight parts of the engine fell over France, and following incidents in September and October the airline halted all flights with the aircraft until they could be inspected.

The aircraft was designed and originally built by Canada's Bombardier, but it had difficulty gaining enough orders.

It was subsequently bought out by Airbus, which has succeeded in getting airlines to place more orders for the aircraft, which offers similar fuel savings to the A320neo series but is somewhat smaller.

The greater fuel economy is in large part due to new engines manufactured by Pratt & Whitney.

While Canadian investigators are continuing to determine the root cause of the in-flight engine shutdowns, they said that ""preliminary investigation results indicate high altitude climbs at higher thrust settings for engines with certain thrust ratings may be a contributor.""

The directive warned that ""this condition, if not corrected, could lead to an uncontained failure of the engine and damage to the aeroplane.""

Furthermore, it urged airlines to avoid conditions where ice could build up on the aircraft and set a maximum altitude of 35,000 feet when they could not.

It said failure to turn off wing de-icing equipment ""above 35,000 feet could result in engine nacelle overheating, and trigger engine fire warnings,"" it added.

Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 25 seconds.

Airbus SE’s new assembly line in Alabama increases the European-based plane maker’s North American footprint at a time when U.S. rival Boeing Co. is struggling.

In August in Mobile, Ala., an Airbus joint venture started making the narrow-body A220, formerly known as the Bombardier C Series.

By contrast, Chicago-based Boeing is focused on returning its grounded 737 MAX jets to service.

“On the A220, we see good order momentum,” said Airbus chief executive officer Guillaume Faury during a conference call with industry analysts.

Airbus owns 50.1 per cent of the Airbus Canada Limited Partnership, which is responsible for the A220. Montreal-based Bombardier Inc.’s stake is nearly 34 per cent and the Quebec government’s investment agency has a 16-per-cent interest.

Faury didn’t directly address Airbus’s rivalry with Boeing, but acknowledged issues with the 737 MAX are “something we see in the press.”

In March of this year, a Boeing MAX 8 flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. In October of last year, 189 people died when a MAX 8 operated by Lion Air of Indonesia fell into the Java Sea after leaving Jakarta.

“That continues to weigh heavily on our company and we’re always going to remember that,” said Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg during a presentation to analysts in August.

“We are working with regulators around the world,” he added, explaining that many approvals will be required before the grounded MAX narrow-body jets return in full force to the skies.

Airbus and Boeing both have global production rates that are slower than what airlines and other customers such as aircraft lessors would like to see.

“We saw a slowdown in overall activity in 2018 driven by supply chain-related delays from Airbus,” according to an analysis by Macquarie Research. “Volume for 2019 is currently lagging 2018 in terms of dollar value of transacted aircraft, given a continuation of Airbus delays as well as the global grounding of the 737 MAX.”

Since 2015, Airbus has done final assembly of the A320 aircraft family in Alabama.

Besides opening the new A220 line in Alabama, Airbus is also continuing with A220 production at its plant in Mirabel, Que., which employs 2,200 people.

While Airbus concentrates on commercial aviation in Alabama, Boeing has a strong presence as the largest aerospace firm in the state, with operations ranging from missile defence to space launch systems.

Steven Udvar-Házy, executive chairman and co-founder of Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corp., pointed out that Airbus has been facing production backlogs, including with the single-aisle, twin-engine A220.

“Based on Airbus getting control of the C Series aircraft, we made a decision to go ahead and order 50 A220-300s,” he told the Deutsche Bank Aircraft Finance and Leasing Conference in September. “We believe this is the most efficient aircraft in the 120 to 150-seat size.”

Udvar-Házy envisages a bright future for the A220, which saw its share of program development delays under Bombardier.

While there are production constraints in Montreal and Mobile, the A220’s increased popularity today contrasts with the struggles to garner customers in the past. “The airplane is getting more acceptance across the board,” said Udvar-Házy.

He noted that broadly speaking, speeding up deliveries isn’t easy, including for the long-range, wide-body A321neo: “We had discussions with Airbus, for example, to try to accelerate some of our 2024 A321neo positions into 2023.”

After tense corporate times for Airbus and Bombardier, the chronology of events eventually tilted in their favour.

In September 2017, Boeing persuaded the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose stiff duties on planned sales of the C Series in the United States.

The following month, Airbus and Bombardier signed a deal to create a new U.S. assembly line for what was then known as the C Series, targeting American customers.

In early 2018, the U.S. International Trade Commission dismissed the Commerce Department’s decision, which alleged the C Series benefited from subsidized pricing.

Fast forward to August 2019, and Airbus is touting the newly opened line for the A220 in Mobile.

“With Mobile, and our production network in Asia, Canada and Europe, we have strategically created a worldwide industrial base to better serve our customers,” said Airbus Americas chief executive officer Jeffrey Knittel in a statement.

Air Canada announced that it will deploy two of its A220-300s in the spring of 2020, with non-stop service on the Montreal-Seattle route and between Toronto and San Jose, Calif.

The A220-300s ordered by Air Canada are being built at Airbus Canada Limited’s Mirabel plant. Air Canada said it will be the first North American airline to fly the larger A220-300 version of the jet.

Editor’s Note: Swiss International Air Lines grounded its entire fleet of A220 aircraft on Oct. 15, following what it called a series of “technical irregularities” relating to the aircraft’s engines. On Oct. 17, Swiss resumed flight operations, adding that its 29 aircraft had all passed inspections.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7442387938499451}",neutral,0.7442387938499451,0
Vietjet orders A321XLR and signs Airbus training services agreement - Airbus,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMC12aWV0amV0LW9yZGVycy1hMzIxeGxyLWFuZC1zaWducy1haXJidXMtdHJhaW5pbmctc2VydmljZXMtYWdyZWVtZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Vietnamese carrier Vietjet has announced that it will add the A321XLR to its fleet, with a firm order for 15 aircraft and the conversion of five A321neo aircraft from its existing backlog. The announcement was made during a visit to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse by Vietjet President & CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, hosted by Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

During the visit, the airline also signed a new training agreement with Airbus Services. This will see Airbus position two new A320 Family full flight simulators at the carrier’s training centre in Ho Chi Minh City. Airbus will also provide a range of training services to the airline and its instructors.

Vietjet will be among the first airlines to receive the A321XLR. The addition of the aircraft to its fleet will allow Vietjet to further expand its network, flying longer routes across Asia, as well as to destinations as far afield as Australia and Russia.

Vietjet President & CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “Vietjet has always been a pioneer in operating new, modern, advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft. We are proud of operating one of the world’s youngest Airbus fleets with an average age of only 2.7 years and this has contributed greatly to Vietjet’s success over the past years. Following the signing of this contract, the new A321XLR will be the perfect upgrade to Vietjet’s fleet as we look to grow our international flight network.”

“Vietjet is one of the fastest growing carriers in the Asian region and we feel proud to have the A321XLR joining its fleet,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “This order is another strong endorsement of our decision to bring true long range capability to the singe-aisle market with the A321XLR, enabling airlines to extend their networks at the lowest possible cost. Furthermore, we are also pleased to develop further our collaboration with Vietjet in the area of training.”

Including today’s announcement, Vietjet has now ordered a total of 186 A320 Family aircraft, of which 60 have been delivered. The airline’s outstanding Airbus backlog is entirely composed of A321neo aircraft.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. The aircraft will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – with 30% lower fuel consumption per seat, compared with previous-generation competitor jets. At the end of September 2019, the A320neo Family had received more than 6,650 firm orders from nearly 110 customers worldwide.

Airbus Services provides state-of-the-art training solutions to ensure safe, reliable and economically-efficient operations on all Airbus aircraft throughout their lifecycle. Airbus is on-hand to offer support every step of the way. A comprehensive and tailored training portfolio is designed and developed by Airbus for airline pilots, cadets, cabin crews, performance & operations engineers, maintenance personnel and structure & repair specialists.

"Airbus Helicopters, Inc. celebrates 50th anniversary - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine","Tue, 01 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWluYy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has celebrated its 50th anniversary of activity in the United States, holding a special celebration for employees, customers, and government officials at its North American headquarters in Grand Prairie, Texas.

This year also marks the company’s 35th anniversary in Canada (with its headquarters in Fort Erie, Ontario), and 15 years of activity at its facility in Columbus, Mississippi.

The manufacturer traces its roots in North America to the signing of a partnership between Aérospatiale and Vought Helicopters, a Texas-based company, in 1969. (Aérospatiale merged with the helicopter division of Deutsche Aerospace to form Airbus Helicopters, then known as Eurocopter, in 1992.) The agreement with Vought saw the company authorized to sell and support Aérospatiale helicopters in the United States and Canada at a time when there were 17 Aérospatiale aircraft flying in North America. The company had just 43 employees.

Aérospatiale took full control of Vought Helicopters in 1974, and changed the company’s name to Aérospatiale Helicopters Corp. in 1976.

Today, there are 2,600 Airbus helicopters flying with over 800 civilian operators in North America (and more than 500 of the manufacturer’s helicopters in the military), and the company has over 1,000 employees in the region.

Indeed, the U.S. is home to the largest fleet of commercial Airbus helicopters flying in the world, with the second largest fleet belonging in Canada. Eight of Airbus’s top 10 customers (in terms of flight hours) are based in North America.

During a media visit ahead of the anniversary celebrations, Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (the official name of the company’s U.S. subsidiary) pointed to the company’s win of a U.S. Coast Guard contract for 100 HH-65 Dauphins in 1979 as being a “gamechanger” for its operations in the region.

The contract was the start of a long-term relationship between Airbus and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; in addition to the Dauphins flying with the Coast Guard, the company has 100 H125s and H120s in operation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It also has more than 440 UH-72 Lakotas flying with the U.S. Army.

The win of the contract for the latter — which began as an order for 345 Lakotas in 2006 — was the second gamechanger for the company’s North American branch, said Trapp. It resulted in Airbus tripling the size of its recently-opened Columbus facility, and significantly increasing its activities in Grand Prairie.

Trapp said the upcoming certification and first deliveries of Airbus’s new-generation medium H160 would be the next landmark event for the company in the region. The type is scheduled for certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) by the end of 2019, with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) set to follow a few months afterwards. Deliveries will start before the end of 2020, with one of the first customers being in North America.

“In the past, our helicopters have dominated the light helicopter segment of the market . . . but the medium size of the market has been for a long time our weakness,” said Trapp, adding that he thought the H160 would fill a need the company has identified for major fleet renewal in the medium-lift sector.

“Just as an example, in the Northeast of the United States you have about 80 medium [private and corporate] helicopters that need to be replaced,” he said. “Right now the customers are waiting to replace them with the right aircraft, and we are bringing on the market a gamechanger in that regard. A completely newly-designed aircraft with new technologies, with various innovations which I believe will make this helicopter the aircraft of choice for the medium-size market in North America. I strongly believe it is going to be our bestseller in the years to come.”

Those technologies include a fully composite airframe, a biplane horizontal stabilizer, a tilted Fenestron tail rotor, and Airbus’s Blue Edge main rotor blades, which feature a swept back blade tip. These various elements combine to provide enhanced performance and a reduction in the aircraft’s noise signature — a particularly appealing mix for those in the private and business aviation sector.

Trapp said most of the demand for the type thus far has been in this sector and from those working in emergency medical services, with offshore oil-and-gas likely to be the third main market, once that sector rebounds.

Site specialization

A couple of years ago, the company completed a restructuring of its organization in North America, merging its activities and creating specialization at each of its three main sites. Columbus became the center of excellence for aircraft assembly (it contains final assembly lines for the H125 and Lakota) and customization; Fort Erie is a center of excellence for the manufacturing of composite parts (used across the Airbus Group); and Grand Prairie is home to the design office, sales and marketing teams, and the support and services center of excellence.

“Thanks to this site specialization, we have been able to offer better service to our customers, and do the activity . . . in a more efficient way,” said Trapp.

He added that the reorganization didn’t result in a headcount reduction — as is often the case. “Our workforce in North America actually increased overall,” he said. “By creating more efficiencies we have been able to better support our customer, [and] when you better support your customer, actually you win more customers.”

So, despite a general industry downturn, Airbus expects to generate just under $1 billion of revenue in North America in 2019. According to the company’s figures, it claimed a market share of 76 percent of all helicopter orders for aircraft of five or more seats in North America in 2018, and delivered 72 percent of helicopters of that size in the region.

“What we have seen is a significant decrease of the overall market, while at the same time our market share . . . has significantly increased,” said Trapp.

The company had a global sales peak of 330 aircraft in 2008, and another high point of 300 in 2013. After a drop in the following years, it rebounded to 260 last year. Trapp said the key has been attracting new customers, which have represented 40 percent of sales in North America since 2013. This compares to a “traditional” figure of about 15 percent.

These new customers have largely been from within the private and business aviation sector (which represented 30 percent of the company’s overall bookings in 2018), and are mostly people who are entirely new to helicopters. However, Airbus has also succeeded in attracting customers who are simply new to its types.

One of the main reasons for the dip in the overall market has been the downturn in the oil-and-gas sector.

“The [offshore transport] industry has, to a large extent, collapsed in the last few years,” said Trapp. “It’s definitely facing major headwinds . . . which has impacted the entire industry — all the OEMs.”

He added that demand is still very low, with several offshore transport operators either facing a chapter 11 bankruptcy process, undergoing one, or having recently emerged from it.

“We don’t expect a recovery in this [offshore] industry actually for the next few years,” said Trapp. “This industry still needs some consolidation and needs to become healthy again.”

According to Will Fulton, head of marketing in North America, the oil-and-gas downturn is forcing operators to change their focus.

“The way that oil-and-gas used to operate is on just oil-and-gas. Just oil-and-gas isn’t working anymore,” he said. These operators are increasingly looking at applying their expertise of operating large aircraft in austere environments to government support contracts around the world, he said.

Similary, Airbus has been busily repurposing its H225 heavy for a new life. “We know it’s not going directly back into oil-and-gas,” said Fulton. “It’s not picking up as quickly as everyone said they thought it [would] . . . and therefore, [we’re] putting it into other modes.”

These new modes include aerial firefighting, said Fulton, which he said had a need for fleet modernization, as well as a growing interest in utilizing larger airframes.

Fulton also revealed that Airbus has “re-engaged” discussions with the FAA for certification of the H175, following renewed interest in the type in North America. The type was certified by EASA in 2014, but its anticipated approval by the FAA wasn’t pursued as the offshore market nosedived. The reignited interest has largely been driven by the private/corporate sector, said Fulton, with operators in the Northeast of the U.S. particularly keen to see the type certified.

In terms of the new five-bladed H145, Airbus has already received an undisclosed number of orders for the retrofit kit from operators in North America. For customers in the region, Airbus will perform the retrofit either at its facility in Columbus, or at one of its service centers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999896287918091}",neutral,0.9999896287918091,0

Airbus electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) development might not be as fast-paced as startups’ development, but it is making progress nonetheless. Here’s what’s new with the Airbus Vahana eVTOL.

Vahana Takes Off With More Details

The Airbus Vahana eVTOL demonstrator just completed the 100th test flight of its Alpha One full-size aircraft. This comes on the heels of an interesting Airbus video from AIN in which Eduardo Dominquez-Puerto, Airbus Head of Urban Air Mobility, talked about how the company is well placed to take full advantage of the eVTOL urban air mobility (UAM) race. The team shared with us some more information on its progress.

Aside from a little poke at the aviation startup world, Airbus’s A^3 is a testbed for its future urban air mobility (UAM) adventures, as per the company’s blog. Matt Deal, who heads the flight test and integration process, as well as test engineer Nico Kokocinski shared more details on the Vahana program.

The A^3 by Airbus team flies the Vahana at the Pendleton Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Range in Pendleton, Oregon. The team explained how the fully autonomous Vahana flies on its own but is also closely monitored by at least seven engineers. From the first flight on January 2018 to its full transition in May of 2019, the Vahana project is maturing. While it is technically still a project, Airbus has said it is not meant to be sold but used as a testbed.

The full-scale technical demonstrator goes beyond what simulation only can do. It shows the real-life behavior and performance of the aircraft. The team demonstrated that the general configuration and control logic are sound with full-scale flights. The team was able to prove its aeroelastic effects work as anticipated.

The Vahana flew 12 “build-up” flights — intermediate speed demonstrations — that show the stability and performance in hover and cruise modes with speeds of up to 100 kts (~115 mph, 185 km/h). What we’ve learned of particular interest is that the batteries can be swapped in fewer than 10 minutes. Two 300 lb lithium-ion battery packs slide in and out of the aircraft, much the same way an EV battery swap station operates, as you can see from the official picture below.

The self-piloted Vahana is in direct control and stays within the confines of its predefined flight plans. The company is testing climbs, descents, turns, as well as a series of maneuvers designed to reveal its handling qualities. Airbus makes a point about having “at least seven engineers and technicians” present for each flight to monitor the aircraft. The is showing how the aircraft can return safely to its starting position for a landing or, if impossible, it activates a parachute.

Safety and noise are big concerns these days whether legitimate or fueled by the media. We do know from various simulations that noise will be less than with traditional helicopters. What is left to be measured is what will be the noise levels of many eVTOL aircraft and other electric fixed-wing aircraft flying at once. We can take a look at our interview of Lucas di Grassi, in which he told me that all Formula E race cars on the track were as “noisy” as one Formula 1 car. We’ll have to wait for a real-live scenario to measure this, but it seems like a good analogy and rule of thumb according to the various sources I have heard simulating eVTOL and electric conventional takeoff and landing (eCTOL) aircraft noise. They will be quieter than the buzz we have over our heads from current internal combustion engine aircraft.

The rest of the blog makes for an interesting read as the duo takes us on a trip of what a typical test day looks like.

I’ve enjoyed reading the Airbus Vahana post, as it shows how the team works and the amount of precaution it is taking to make sure the public sees that safety is at the heart of Airbus, as we hear in the news often.

Munich, 18 October 2019 – Solar Orbiter, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) flagship mission to study the Sun has completed all tests and is set to be flown to Cape Canaveral ready for its launch in February 2020.

Built by Airbus in Stevenage, Solar Orbiter will study the Sun in detail and its effects on the solar system. The spacecraft carries a suite of complementary instruments that will measure the particles, fields and waves of the plasma through which it travels, and at the same time make observations of the Sun's surface and outer atmosphere, the photosphere and corona.

Solar Orbiter has been undergoing testing at the IABG test centre near Munich since October 2018. These included electromagnetic compatibility, vibration and thermal vacuum, as well as deployment of solar arrays and booms from the spacecraft. All tests have been successfully completed.

“Solar Orbiter has been one of the most challenging and exciting missions we have ever designed and built here at Stevenage. Sending it so close to the Sun means that some parts of the spacecraft have to withstand temperatures of more than 500°C with others in permanent shadow down to a nippy -180°C. To ensure the very sensitive instruments can measure the Sun’s fields and particles, the spacecraft itself must be totally invisible to its sensors, which has pushed us to the absolute limits of what is technically achievable,” said Eckard Settelmeyer, Airbus’ Head of Earth Observation, Navigation and Science Institutional Satellite Projects.

At its closest point Solar Orbiter will be closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, at a distance of 0.28 Astronomical Units (42 million kilometres), in an orbit that takes it out of the ecliptic plane. From here, it can perform long-duration observations of the same region of the Sun’s surface, and have visibility of the Sun’s polar regions. It will be one of the closest approaches of the Sun by any spacecraft, where sunlight is thirteen times more intense than it is for satellites orbiting the Earth.

Solar Orbiter must survive intense thermal radiation and protect its instrument suite, while at the same time allowing those instruments to observe the Sun. The heat shield and new high-temperature solar array technology are key to its operational success. To position itself and raise its orbit above the poles, Solar Orbiter will make a complex series of gravitational-assist fly-bys past both Earth and Venus.

The Sun releases bursts of high-energy particles (Coronal Mass Ejections), which can disrupt electrical power distribution systems, cause computers to crash, damage satellites and endanger astronauts. Solar Orbiter will observe the Sun from an elliptic orbit around it, and provide scientific data to better understand the mechanisms on the Sun that cause these violent and disruptive outbursts.

Solar Orbiter builds on hugely successful Airbus-built missions such as SOHO and Ulysses that have provided remarkable insights into the workings of our Sun. Like those missions, it is a collaboration between ESA and NASA.

The mission lifetime will be nearly eight years.

About Solar Orbiter

Solar Orbiter is an international collaborative space mission between ESA and NASA to study the Sun, its outer atmosphere, and what drives the dynamic outflow of solar wind that affects Earth. The spacecraft will observe the Sun's atmosphere up close with high spatial resolution telescopes and compare these observations with measurements taken in the environment directly surrounding the spacecraft – together creating a detailed picture of how the Sun affects the space environment around Earth and further out in the solar system. Thanks to its unique — and difficult to achieve — orbit, Solar Orbiter will also provide the first-ever pictures of the Sun's polar regions, offering key insights into the poorly-understood magnetic environment there, which helps drive the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle and its periodic outpouring of solar storms. Solar Orbiter relies on a combination of 10 instruments, built throughout Europe and in the U.S., carefully chosen and designed so as to support and amplify each other’s observations, together providing the single most comprehensive and integrated view of the Sun and its environment ever achieved.

"Do planes from Boeing’s rival, Airbus, have software problems? - Al Jazeera English","Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDE5LzEwLzI0L2RvLXBsYW5lcy1mcm9tLWJvZWluZ3Mtcml2YWwtYWlyYnVzLWhhdmUtc29mdHdhcmUtcHJvYmxlbXPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9lY29ub215LzIwMTkvMTAvMjQvZG8tcGxhbmVzLWZyb20tYm9laW5ncy1yaXZhbC1haXJidXMtaGF2ZS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1wcm9ibGVtcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A probe into a series of failures with Airbus’s smallest jet, the A220, is trying to determine whether a software change set off unexpected vibrations that damaged fast-moving parts and forced three emergency landings, people familiar with the case said.

Planemaker Airbus is the biggest rival of Boeing, which manufactures the also-troubled 737 MAX jets.

Swiss International Air Lines briefly halted its fleet of A220 jets for checks on October 15 after a third flight in as many months was forced to divert because of engine damage.

Engine maker Pratt & Whitney, which manufactures the A220 on behalf of Airbus and which made the engines that had the three emergency landings, also expanded checks on similar engines worldwide.

Investigators are focusing their attention on recent changes in engine software that may have caused parts that compress air inside the engine to be set in a way that caused mechanical resonance or destructive vibrations, two of the sources said.

Neither the aircraft nor the engine has been grounded, but pilots have been told to avoid certain combinations of thrust settings and altitude to avoid the risk of a new problem until the root cause of the three engine failures is found.

A third source said it might take until December to confirm the cause, while other scenarios have also not been ruled out.

Airbus, which is based in the Netherlands and was starting a Pacific tour to promote the A220 on Thursday, had no immediate comment on the investigation.

Officials at the United States National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading an investigation into the recent failures involving the engine, declined to comment.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it was monitoring the situation closely and coordinating with the US Federal Aviation Administration.

The head of Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies said earlier this week that it was working on finding the cause and remained confident in the new fuel-saving engine.

“Clearly, any time you get an issue like this, we’re on top of it. The guys are working through it,” United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes told analysts on a conference call.

No one was hurt in the three incidents, which all took place during flights over France between London and Geneva. But parts from two of the A220 engines were found on the ground.

France’s air-accident agency – the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety – has launched a rare appeal for 150 volunteers to help search a wooded area in eastern France for a key component of the engines during the coming weeks.

Fuel savings

Pratt & Whitney set off a chain reaction of new aircraft designs or upgrades in 2008, when it announced its new geared turbofan engine, promising 16 percent fuel savings. But since then, it has wrestled with a spate of performance or reliability problems and delays.

Although software problems can take time to fix, experts say they are more likely rectified with a software update rather than by designing a new part.

Formerly known as the CSeries, the 110-130-seat A220 was designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc and was one of the first to adopt the new Pratt & Whitney technology. Bombardier sold the programme to Airbus last year due to heavy losses.

The Airbus version of the engines is not affected by the recent problems and is not subject to checks.

Some competing Brazilian aircrafts such as the Embraer 190 and 195-E2 have also been subject to such engine checks, but reportedly use a different version of the software from the larger A220.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8666520714759827}",negative,0.8666520714759827,-1

Fort Worth, Texas - Air Center Helicopters, Inc (ACHI) has signed a set of HCare Smart parts-by-the-hour contracts for 10 of its Airbus H225 helicopters. These aircraft are currently in operation with the U.S. Armed Forces for passenger transport, Special Operations Forces training, vertical replenishment and casualty evacuation missions.

The HCare Smart contracts cover a three-year period and have been customized to meet the material support and spare parts requirements of helicopters flying in demanding theaters of operation, including a dedicated spare parts consignment stock. With this contract, 10 of the 17 H225s in ACHI’s fleet are now covered by HCare.

“Our in-service H225 fleet was repurposed from the offshore oil & gas market and retrofitted for new missions in just under one year,” said Rod Tinney, CEO of ACHI. “Today these 10 civilian helicopters are on contract performing military missions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in three countries and two oceans. In a short amount of time, they have already accumulated more than 3,000 flight hours. Having in-service support we can rely on through HCare is indispensable and will help us continue this momentum, flying an expected 400 to 1000 flight hours per year per aircraft.”

“Thanks to ACHI’s innovative approach, these civil aircraft have been swiftly put back in service for new missions with military customers, making their H225 fleet among the world’s largest,” said Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters. “Ensuring aircraft availability through support packages tailored to the unique needs of military operators is an essential requirement, and one that we’re honoured to provide ACHI.”

ACHI’s remaining seven H225s are currently undergoing retrofit for their new missions and are expected to all enter operation by March 2020. As of today, around 55 former oil & gas H225s have been reconfigured for aerial work, utility, firefighting and search and rescue.

Airbus Helicopters’ range of HCare material management services starts out with Easy (on-request catalogue services) and Smart (four by-the-hour options), before progressively building up to Infinite (full availability commitments).

HCare is Airbus Helicopters’ comprehensive services offer, providing superior customer service support in five domains: Material Management; Helicopter Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and upgrades; Technical Support; Training & Flight Operations and Connected Services.

VietJet Aviation has ordered 20 Airbus long-range A321XLR aircraft that the budget carrier hopes will support its international expansion as Vietnam‘s aviation market heats up.

VietJet expects the first aircraft to be delivered in 2023, it said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it will be the “first carrier in the world” to operate the new long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family jets.

Industry sources said VietJet would be among the first to put the XLR into service.

Vietnam’s largest conglomerate in August applied to launch an airline next year, intensifying competition in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets.

The sector includes Vietnam Airlines, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, and Vietnam Air Services Co.

The airline also signed a separate agreement in Toulouse, France, for two A320/A321 aircraft simulators.

VietJet’s order book for Airbus aircraft now totals 186, the airline said.

In September, Reuters reported that Airbus sold 15 A321XLR jets to VietJet.

Airbus on Thursday confirmed that VietJet had placed a new order for 15 XLR and said another five would be converted to the new jet from the A321neo model.

VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said Thursday’s order will “modernise VietJet’s fleet as we look to strongly grow our international flight network.”

The airline currently flies to destinations including Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and India.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990636706352234}",neutral,0.9990636706352234,0

Donauwörth – Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first NH90 Sea Lion naval multi-role helicopter to the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw), with a further two to be delivered by the end of the year.

In total, 18 Sea Lions have been ordered for the German Navy, with deliveries expected to be completed in 2022. The selection of the Sea Lion as the successor to the Sea King was made in March 2013 and the corresponding contract was signed in June 2015.

“I am proud of our teams who worked hard to meet the ambitious delivery schedule of our customer, whose continuous support has also been key in making it happen,” said Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland. “During the summer, we successfully completed demonstration flights involving the German Navy and BAAINBw to verify the Sea Lion capabilities for search and rescue as well as special forces missions. I am confident that these helicopters will bring next-generation capabilities to the German Navy, and I’m committed to ensure the best level of support for the Sea Lion fleet.”

When deployed, NH90 Sea Lions will take on a wide range of roles including search and rescue (SAR), maritime reconnaissance, special forces as well as personnel and material transportation missions. In addition to its land-based use, the Sea Lion will also operate on Type 702 (Berlin class) combat support ships.

Thanks to its multi-role capability and growth capability, the Sea Lion will not only replace the German Navy’s Sea King Mk41 fleet but significantly enhance its operational capabilities. The fly-by-wire flight controls of the NH90 Sea Lion reduce the crew’s workload thanks to its high precision and ease of use, which particularly come to the fore in over-water hovering, even in poor weather conditions.

The German Navy has also recently opted for the naval version of the NH90 to succeed its 22 Sea Lynx Mk 88A on-board helicopters that have been in service since 1981.

Five nations are already using the NH90 in its naval NFH (NATO Frigate Helicopter) version and have completed more than 50,000 flying hours in SAR, humanitarian and military missions, with the 90 helicopters that have been delivered so far. The 399 helicopters that make up the worldwide NH90 fleet have already completed over 230,000 flying hours. This first Sea Lion is also the 400th NH90 helicopter to be delivered.

The Orion test engineers from Airbus are more than satisfied. From July to September, several mission-critical engine tests were successfully completed.

When the Orion spacecraft flies to the moon for the first time - without astronauts on its maiden flight - it needs a perfectly working propulsion system. 33 engines ensure that Orion masters the journey to the moon, around it, and back to Earth. The propulsion system also includes high-performance valves, hundreds of sensors, fuel tanks and fuel lines, and electronics that control this complex system.

A special test program was developed to prove that this propulsion system works as expected. Airbus engineers developed and built their own test module, the Propulsion Qualification Module (PQM), for ESA and NASA. Testing takes place in the desert of New Mexico (USA), in NASA's White Sands Test Facility.

Since 2017 the PQM is already located in White Sands. The development of the test procedures, the hot run tests and the subsequent evaluations are time-consuming. ""We have to carry out many different tests here, depending on the mission scenario,"" explains Jan Hass, test manager for the Airbus team.

""Main engine, auxiliary engines and attitude control engines are needed and controlled in different situations. In July, we qualified propulsion subsystems, for which all engines were ignited in several situations. In August, we tested the main engine and ran it together with the auxiliary engines for more than 10 minutes. In doing so, we simulated the launch into Earth orbit following a mission abort.""

""The design and structural implementation of the propulsion system are very challenging tasks,"" explains Mathias Gronowski, Chief Engineer in the Orion ESM Program. ""It's not just a matter of functionality, but also of ensuring that all other subsystems are safe when the engines are on fire. Given the packing density of the service module, these are really tricky situations for our designers. The engines of the service module are needed on the journey to the moon only in certain situations, but exactly then everything must be right, pressure, impulse etc.... Furthermore, the interfaces with the crew module have to be considered.""

All the more important are the good test results now for the Airbus team. ""I would like to express my sincere thanks and respect to all involved for this achievement,"" says Oliver Juckenhöfel, Head of On-Orbit Services & Exploration. ""This is an impressive demonstration of our capabilities for our customers and will continue to maintain our good reputation with ESA and NASA"".

The tests have not yet been fully completed. However, the results are so significant that the already assembled Orion can now be flown including the European Service Module from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to the NASA test site in Plum Brook (Ohio). Thermal vacuum tests are scheduled there.

Meanwhile, Jan Hass is looking forward to the final series of tests. ""A major milestone has been reached. It's certainly tough conditions here in New Mexico, but being part of the team that brings people to the moon again just makes me proud"".

Orion propulsion system

Orion's main thrust is provided by a reused Space Shuttle engine. With a thrust of 27 KN, it ensures that the spacecraft enters the moon's orbit and can leave for Earth again. Eight auxiliary engines are ready to take over should the main engine fail. Finally there are 24 ArianeGroup attitude control engines from Lampoldshausen. All engines are supplied by four tanks, each holding 2000 litres of fuel, pressurized by helium tanks. An electronic box ensures correct control and a sophisticated electronic pressure control concept ensures that the engines are supplied with the required fuel. 400 bar must be regulated down to the required pressure.

Orion: On behalf of the European Space Agency ESA, Airbus designs and builds the European Service Module to provide power, energy, consumables and thermal control for the astronauts. Hence Airbus works in close co-operation with NASA and Lockheed Martin in the US and coordinates companies in 10 European countries. During the IAC in October in Washington the international space community will discuss the roadmap to lunar exploration - of which Orion is an essential part. Airbus is more than happy to contribute and participate to this human endeavor.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991638660430908}",neutral,0.9991638660430908,0

Assisting humanitarian efforts with Airbus' versatile C295 airlifter - Airbus,"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTEwLWFzc2lzdGluZy1odW1hbml0YXJpYW4tZWZmb3J0cy13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy12ZXJzYXRpbGUtYzI5NS1haXJsaWZ0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus C295 – which demonstrates its transport capabilities in daily service with military operators around the world – has also underscored the multi-role airlifter’s performance during life-saving humanitarian missions.

This activity includes the maiden deployment of a C295 operated by Kenya-based DAC Aviation International, sent to Mozambique in March following one of the worst-ever tropical storms to hit Africa: Cyclone Idai.

A bridge providing the only way in and out of Espungabera township in Mozambique was destroyed, and the area was cut off; without a road to connect to the rest of the country, Espungabera residents faced a serious food shortage. As the town is located on top of a mountain and the “airstrip” is simply an open area on a side of the mountain, landing most airplanes would be impossible.

With its impressive carrying capacity and its excellent take-off/landing performance from unprepared landing zones, the C295 was flown into Espungabera, as well as to other affected areas – opening “air bridges” that significantly enhanced relief efforts. The food and medicine it delivered provided enough supplies to support these communities until surface transportation was reopened.

Designed for the mission

The C295 is ideal for a full range of humanitarian missions with its capability to operate from unprepared, rough and short airstrips, as well as flying routinely without refuelling throughout the day thanks to its high fuel capacity combined with its consumption performance. The airlifter’s efficiency – using 50% less fuel compared to older aircraft with similar capabilities – makes it more environmentally friendly and increases its usability in dire situations, as a shortage of fuel is common in emergency settings.

Its wide fuselage and large rear ramp simplify loading and unloading, saving time when moments count. In addition to that, the versatility of the cabin configuration, being able to carry passengers –up to 43- and cargo (combi configuration), evacuate patients or casualties in stretchers up to 21 of them, or even airdrop the cargo; adds an additional advantage to the contracting agency to maximize utilization of the aircraft.

Humanitarian uses of the C295 in Mozambique did not end with disaster relief: following the outbreak of cholera, the aircraft also is transporting lifesaving anti-cholera kits from Maputo, the country’s capital, to Beira. Additionally, the C295 transported food and water, along with sanitation and hygiene goods.

The C295 is revolutionising the way humanitarian operations are conducted. From airdrops to the evacuation of up to 70 people, and reaching remote areas on missions without refuelling, the airlifter responds to the needs of relief efforts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9881420731544495}",neutral,0.9881420731544495,0

After having operated several test flights around Toulouse (TLS) since Sept. 12, 2019, Airbus took the aircraft on a test flight away from mainland France for the first time today, operating a round trip between TLS and Ajaccio (AJA), Corsica.

Unit 868 was originally delivered to UPS in 2006. It was ferried from Louisville (SDF) to TLS for the upgrades in February 2019. UPS announced the project in May 2017, in partnership with Airbus and Honeywell, which will see all fifty-two of UPS’ A300Fs receiving new LCD displays, updated flight management systems and other modern avionics.

UPS told Cargo Facts that, after unit 868 is redelivered in the second half of 2020, the whole upgrade project is anticipated to last through 2022. At the same time, under a separate project also announced in May 2017, UPS is upgrading the cockpits of its 757Fs and 767Fs to feature a large-format display system from Collins Aerospace. That project covers all seventy-five of UPS’ 757-200Fs, three 767-300BCFs and fifty-nine 767-300Fs. UPS said that thirty-five 757s and nine 767s have already received the modifications.

UPS declined to give details on how much of an investment the A300 upgrade entails, but noted that it is significantly more complex than the 757/767 project, replacing both displays and many cockpit components, while the 757s and 767s are only receiving new displays.

The aircraft being used for the tour is an A220-300 leased from Latvia’s airBaltic, which will visit nine destinations in seven countries. These will include three stops in Asia on the return journey to Europe.

The first stop of the tour will be the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, home to the region’s A220 launch customer Air Vanuatu. The aircraft will then visit Australia (Sydney and Brisbane), New Zealand (Auckland), New Caledonia (Noumea) and Papua New Guinea (Port Moresby). On the way back to Europe, the aircraft will stop in Cambodia (Phnom Penh) and India (Bangalore and New Delhi).



Static displays are planned at each stop, as well as demonstration flights for airline executives and other invited guests.



The A220 is the only new design aircraft in the 100-150 seat market and incorporates state-of-the-art technologies, the latest aerodynamic design and new-generation engines. Together, these advances generate fuel savings of at least 20% compared with older-generation aircraft of a similar size.

In addition, the A220 offers extended range capability of up to 3,400 nautical miles. This makes the aircraft especially suitable for the kind of operations seen in the Pacific region, including short- to medium-haul operations between the various island nations, as well as longer routes to Australia and New Zealand.

The airBaltic A220-300 is fitted with a single-class passenger cabin with 145 seats. As on all A220 aircraft, the layout comprises three seats on one side of the aisle and two on the other. The cabin is the largest in its size category, with wider economy class seats and spacious overhead storage bins.

The A220 is available in two versions, with the A220-100 seating between 100 and 130 passengers and the larger A220-300 seating between 130 and 160 in typical airline layouts. At the end of September 2019, customers worldwide had placed orders for 525 A220 aircraft with 90 already in service with six operators.

Delta said that new U.S. tariffs placed on Airbus planes “will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines” and impact its profits.

The airline’s comments came after the World Trade Organization said the U.S. can levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over subsidies the European Union inappropriately provided to the French airplane maker.

A Delta spokesperson told FOX Business that, even if the airline could get out of its contractual obligations with Airbus, U.S. airplane maker Boeing likely wouldn't have the capacity to produce additional aircraft and deliver them in the same timeframe that Airbus had already been working on.

""Aircraft are significant purchases requiring long-lead times for production — often years in advance,"" the spokesperson said. “Imposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the traveling public.""

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it will impose a 10 percent tariff on large commercial aircraft. Agricultural and other industrial goods will face even higher tariffs.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. will impose the new tariffs on Oct. 18.

""For years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the U.S. aerospace industry and our workers,"" Lighthizer said.

Officials released a list of new tariffs Wednesday after the WTO sided with the U.S. in finding the EU provided illegal subsidies to Airbus, giving it an unfair edge and costing Boeing sales as a result. Litigation in the case had been going on for close to 15 years. The annual reward of $7.5 billion in tariffs is the largest award in WTO history.

The EU has also accused the U.S. of providing subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules.

European leaders have threatened to respond to U.S. tariffs with new tariffs of their own. In April, the EU released a list of $20 billion in U.S. products it may target with tariffs.

The planes will be a mix of A319, A320 and A321 craft, all in the fuel-efficient neo version.

Spirit purchased an A321 in September 2016, the tenth plane delivered from the Airbus final assembly line in Mobile, and in 2017 the first Mobile-built A320.

“This new order represents another milestone for Spirit,” said Ted Christie, president and CEO of Spirit, an ultra-low-cost carrier based in South Florida. “The additional aircraft will be used to support Spirit’s growth as we add new destinations and expand our network across the U.S., Latin American, and the Caribbean.”

“The Airbus A320 family has been a strong platform for the remarkable success of Spirit over the past several years,” said Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer. “We look forward to playing a part in the Spirit team’s continued growth for many, many years to come.”

The Airbus neo — or new engine option — versions use new generation engines and Sharklets — the Airbus terms for up-curved wingtips — to cut fuel burn by about 20 percent and noise by about half, compared to previous generation aircraft.

As of the end of September, Airbus has more than 6,650 firm orders for A320 neo family aircraft from about 110 customers worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",positive,0.9999972581863403,1
Airbus shares more details on Vahana flight test program - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNoYXJlcy1tb3JlLWRldGFpbHMtdmFoYW5hLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0LXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With Airbus’s Vahana eVTOL demonstrator recently completing its 100th test flight, the team behind the aircraft has shared new insights into the flight testing process.

In an Oct. 10 blog post, head of flight test Matt Deal and integration and test engineer Nico Kokocinski describe a typical day for the Vahana program at the Pendleton Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Range near Pendleton, Oregon. Not only has Vahana been flying without a human on board, the aircraft is completely self-piloted, following a predefined flight plan for each flight.

“No one is ever in direct control of the vehicle,” Deal and Kokocinski explain. Vahana’s pre-programmed flight plans can include climbs and descents, turns, and other maneuvers designed to reveal its performance and handling qualities. All flight plans are validated through multiple simulation methods before being flown on the full-scale aircraft.

While Vahana technically flies itself, at least seven engineers and technicians are present for each flight to monitor systems via telemetry, inspect the aircraft, and conduct the actual test. According to Deal and Kokocinski, in the event of an unexpected behavior during the flight, Vahana can perform one of several contingency maneuvers, including returning to its starting position to land, landing immediately, or activating a parachute.

To minimize such unexpected behavior, the Vahana team has expanded the aircraft’s operating envelope gradually in order to adapt the vehicle or control logic “before issues become hazards. For instance, after completing our extensive ground test campaign, Vahana flew at 12 intermediate speeds to demonstrate stability and performance between hover and its design cruise speed of 100 knots,” the authors write.

Because batteries store less energy than fuel and need to recharge between flights, Vahana’s engineers designed its batteries to be swappable in less than 10 minutes, allowing them to perform multiple flight tests in a day. The aircraft has two 300-pound (135-kilogram) lithium-ion batteries that slide into the vehicle on rails using a custom cart. They are then charged off aircraft with a charging station normally used for electric cars.

According to Deal and Kokocinski, full-scale flight testing has been critical to the advancement of the program.

“Simulation can tell us a lot about the behavior and performance of the aircraft; subscale vehicles can demonstrate that the general configuration and control logic are sound; but only full-scale flights prove that our designs and systems perform as well as expected, especially when considering scaling and aeroelastic effects,” they write. “In addition, the data collected in flight helps improve models and design tools to more closely match real-world behavior.”

Airbus to sell 100 jets to US carrier Spirit Airlines - CNBC,"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTAvMjQvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXNlbGwtMTAwLWpldC1wbGFuZXMtdG8tdXMtY2Fycmllci1zcGlyaXQtYWlybGluZXMuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE5LzEwLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy10by1zZWxsLTEwMC1qZXQtcGxhbmVzLXRvLXVzLWNhcnJpZXItc3Bpcml0LWFpcmxpbmVzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines has agreed on a provisional deal to buy 100 Airbus single-aisle jet planes.

Spirit Airlines said late Wednesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the European plane-maker that includes a mix of Airbus A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo models.

At 2018 list prices, the deal would be worth around $12 billion in sales to Airbus, but the airline has almost certainly negotiated a steep discount.

The jets are planned for delivery through to the end of 2027. A separate option to purchase up to 50 additional aircraft was also agreed upon.

Based in South Florida, Spirit is considered an ultra-low-cost carrier that serves the Americas. It currently operates an all-Airbus fleet.

""This new order represents another milestone for Spirit,"" said President and CEO Ted Christie in a press release.

""The additional aircraft will be used to support Spirit's growth as we add new destinations and expand our network across the U.S, Latin America and the Caribbean,"" he added.

The deal marks a notable win for Airbus given that Washington is to impose tariffs on some Airbus planes sold into the United States. It is unknown if Spirit managed to negotiate any tariff-related discount, but it may be irrelevant as Airbus does build A320 planes in the state of Alabama.

Spirit's stock has fallen around 35% this year, primarily due to guidance in July suggesting earnings per share in 2019 would be roughly flat.

Shares of the firm jumped nearly 5% after the bell Wednesday following the Airbus announcement and the airline's third-quarter beat on earnings per share and revenue.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999805688858032}",neutral,0.9999805688858032,0

Greenland – Air Greenland has ordered two Airbus H225 heavy helicopters to support its bid to win its home country’s search and rescue (SAR) contract.

Under the terms of a firm contract assisted by Airbus Helicopters, two H225s repurposed from the oil and gas industry will be delivered over the coming months to replace the ageing S-61 helicopter currently used for the service.

Airbus will provide a comprehensive maintenance and support package as well as pilot and crew training.

Airbus Helicopters Head of Europe Region Olivier Michalon said: “At Airbus, we are proud that the deployment of the H225 will help ensure the safety of global maritime traffic transiting the Greenland-Iceland gap to and from the Arctic region”.

The 11-tonne category, twin-engine H225 is the latest member of Airbus Helicopters’ Super Puma family with more powerful engines providing a smoother ride and enhanced performance compared to earlier models.

It is the largest model in Airbus Helicopters’ portfolio and has accumulated more than 600,000 flight hours out of more than 5.5 million flight hours recorded by the Super Puma family.

Equipped with state-of-the-art electronic instruments and a 4-axis autopilot system, the H225 offers outstanding endurance and fast cruise speed, and can be fitted with a wide range of SAR equipment. Operated by two pilots, it can be configured with up to 18 seats or six stretchers and has all-weather capability including full anti-icing.

The H225 and military H225M are benchmarks in SAR and combat SAR and are operated by 20 nations worldwide.

Air Greenland CEO Jacob Nitter Sørensen said: “These two specific aircraft have low numbers of flight hours and their remarkable capability on SAR operations ensures that they will be able to provide a highly effective service in that role for many years to come.”

The new tax is part of USD7.5 billion worth of tariffs announced on October 2, with a 25% tax heaped on exports from the EU on everything from French wine to Italian salami. This is all in retaliation for subsidies allegedly given to Airbus in a dispute that goes back 15 years.

The list of affected products subject to additional import duties of 10% specifies: “New airplanes and other aircraft (other than military airplanes or other military aircraft) of an unladen weight exceeding 30,000kg.”

The move came after the US was given authorisation from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which has the authority globally to set rulings on trade disputes, the Guardian newspaper reported. The EU has responded that it now has no choice but to retaliate itself. In spring 2020, the WTO is preparing to rule on what tariffs the EU can impose due to US state aid given to Boeing (BOE, Washington National).

Implemented by the Trump administration, the case nevertheless goes back to 2004 when the US alleged that Airbus illegally received loans on preferential terms and billions of euros in grants from EU countries for the development of the A380 and the A350. The WTO gave a mixed verdict in 2010 and years of appeals followed.

Airbus has argued that tariffs on aircraft will bring further insecurity to airlines and to the wider global economy and urged a negotiated settlement.

“Airbus will continue working with its US partners, customers, and suppliers to address all potential consequences of such tariffs that would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the US airlines but also US jobs, suppliers, and air travellers,” said Guillaume Faury, the manufacturer's chief executive. “Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy.”

Delta Air Lines (DL, Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson) has around 170 Airbus aircraft on order, the cost of which could increase.

“Aircraft are significant purchases requiring long lead times for production - often years in advance,” the carrier said in a statement. “Imposing tariffs on aircraft that US companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on US airlines, the millions of Americans they employ, and the travelling public.”

According to the newspaper Le Monde, Airbus has already proved it has abandoned most of the subsidies that have been denounced by the US. Only 6% of its production, mainly the A350 and A380, still benefit, and Airbus has announced it will stop production of the latter in 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.798048198223114}",neutral,0.798048198223114,0

Airbus Helicopters Inc. (AHI) invited media guests to its facilities in Columbus, Mississippi and Grand Prairie, Texas to learn about its products and operations, capped off by a special flight on the H135 light twin helicopter.

Following a safety briefing, our flight departed from the Airbus Helicopters facility at Grand Prairie Municipal Airport (GPM). Our aircraft, N135HX was completed in March of this year. The H135 passenger cabin was fully occupied with six guests, seated in two rows which faced each other. Each passenger wore a Bose headset in order to hear the pilot and communicate between each other. On the exterior, the H135 operates 6.5 decibels below the ICAO standard noise limit, meaning it can come and go while causing minimal disturbance to those on the ground.

As we cruised at 1,100 feet above ground level, the cabin had a mild, calming vibration that felt like a massage chair. Passenger legroom felt ample for a heli, roughly equivalent to that of most airlines’ economy class, and overhead air conditioning vents kept us cool throughout the trip. We wore 5-point harness belts to minimize movement, but the pleasant weather kept the flight very smooth.

H135 Specifications and Capabilities

1 or 2 pilots and up to six passengers

EMS configuration fits two medics and a stretcher

160 miles per hour max speed

342 nautical mile range

6,576 pounds maximum takeoff weight

Engines — Safran Arrius 2B2plus or Pratt & Whitney Canada’s 206B3

Our pilot, Chief Instructor Tim McAdams explained and demonstrated the H135’s modern performance functions, including the Helionix avionics suite. Helionix was developed in-house by Airbus, designed to reduce pilot workload and increase safety by presenting the most relevant information when the pilot needs it. Its latest Step 3 upgrade includes 3D real-time terrain mapping in its Synthetic Vision System (SVS), along with an upgraded Helicopter Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (HTAWS). The avionics information is displayed on the Garmin GTN 750 touchscreen display. The displays can be mounted for one or two pilots.

McAdams also demonstrated the H135s autopilot functions, such as hovering, target following, and ascent/descent at specified rates. Interestingly, he served as training instructor for action film star Tom Cruise in the 2018 film, ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout.’ Cruise did all of his own flying for his helicopter scenes in the movie.

The highlight of our demonstration flight included aerial views of the current and future Texas Rangers baseball stadiums, and AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys NFL football team. AHI is very proud to have Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as a customer.

Jones purchased a H145 to shuttle him between the team’s facilities, which are nearly 40 miles apart and take up to an hour and a half to commute between by car. The flight between facilities takes as little as 13 minutes. The helicopter saves the billionaire hours of valuable time by avoiding road traffic. Jones made a special fly-in appearance at AHI’s 50th Anniversary customer party in Grand Prairie on 26 September.

Airbus Helicopters offers customers a myriad of interior customization options, from seats and seating surfaces to décor. In addition, customers can play with the exterior look of their new rotorcraft by downloading a paint configurator app for Apple iOS or Android devices.

Apart from corporate and personal use, the H135 is used in a variety of missions worldwide, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and tourism scenery flights.

AHI is currently working with the US Navy on a campaign to sell the H135 as an off-the-shelf training solution. Built in Columbus, Mississippi, H135s are currently being used by militaries in 12 other countries for this purpose.

Swiss grounds Airbus A220 jets after finding engine faults - American Journal of Transportation,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWpvdC5jb20vbmV3cy9zd2lzcy1ncm91bmRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLWpldHMtYWZ0ZXItZmluZGluZy1lbmdpbmUtZmF1bHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: William Wilkes and Richard Weiss | Oct 15 2019 at 11:55 AM | Air Cargo

Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s Swiss airline grounded its fleet of Airbus SE A220 jets after diverting a flight from London to Geneva due an engine fault, the latest in a series of technical issues with the turbines made by Pratt & Whitney.

The carrier suspended flights of the model in order to carry out inspections, according to a spokesman. Swiss operates 29 A220s, making it the biggest operator in the world of the aircraft. The grounding will affect a quarter of its fleet and will lead to cancellations.

Swiss’s A220s have suffered multiple incidents in recent months, most recently on July 25 when a flight from Geneva to London experienced engine failure after part of the turbine disintegrated over Paris. Another flight from Zurich to Dusseldorf had to turn around earlier the same month, also due to a turbine problem.

Pratt & Whitney, a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp., developed the fuel-efficient geared turbofan in an effort to reestablish its presence in powering narrow-body planes. But the GTF’s debut has been marred by a series of teething problems, including a 2014 failure when an engine caught fire during testing of the A220, a plane that was formerly known as the Bombardier Inc. C Series.

The engines were also one of the options for the Airbus’s best-selling A320 family jets. Glitches on those models have largely been ironed out as the installed fleet grew bigger. The A220, however, is a niche aircraft for regional services and Airbus has delivered less than 100 worldwide.

Swiss said it’s talking with regulators, Pratt & Whitney and Airbus about the issues. It’s also investigating what happened during Tuesday’s incident.

“Together with the engine maker we are supporting our customer in its daily operations,” an Airbus spokesman said by email. In a separate statement, Pratt said the engines “continue to meet all criteria for continued airworthiness.” It advised additional inspections.

As of Sept. 30, Airbus had delivered 20 A220-300 models to Swiss, as well as nine of the smaller A220-100 variants. Airbus acquired control of the A220 program from Montreal-based Bombardier last year.

Pratt’s PW1900G engine is also used on the Embraer E195-E2, the first of which was just delivered last month to Azul and AerCap. Other large A220 operators are Air Baltic, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Korean Air Lines Co.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9803580045700073}",negative,0.9803580045700073,-1

How Boeing Tried to Kill a Great Airplane—and Got Outplayed - The Daily Beast,"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2hvdy1ib2VpbmctdHJpZWQtdG8ta2lsbC1hLWdyZWF0LWFpcnBsYW5lYW5kLWdvdC1vdXRwbGF5ZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As soon as Boeing’s top management understood what they were looking at they didn’t like it.

Another company had produced a paragon of an airplane and they had nothing to match it. And so Boeing decided it had to do as much harm to that airplane’s chances as it could—most of all, to stop any American airline from buying it.

The company was Bombardier, based in Canada. The airplane was the Bombardier C Series, a single-aisle jet that, in several versions, could seat between 100 and 150 passengers.

What was striking about the C Series was that the Canadians had combined the most advanced technologies available into an airplane that was, as a result, a generation ahead of any similar size model.

Airlines would love it because its engines were so efficient that it was cheaper to operate than any rival. On domestic routes it could make as many as 11 flights in a day, with a turnaround time at gates of 35 minutes. Passengers would love it because the cabin was quiet, the seats not cramped, the air quality noticeably better, and baggage space generous.

But creating the C Series had pushed Bombardier to the edge financially, costing around $5.5 billion to bring it to a first flight in March 2015. Like most technologically ambitious programs, this one had busted its budget and was not meeting its delivery deadlines. And its engines, made by America’s Pratt & Whitney, were equally venturesome and late because of glitches.

Nonetheless, when airlines checked it out they were impressed. So was Boeing’s chief rival, Airbus. At the 2015 Paris Air Show, Airbus’s chief salesman, John Leahy, not known for being kind to competitors, took a look at it and conceded that the C Series was “a nice little airplane.”

Delta Air Lines agreed. In April 2016, it was the first American airline to order it, for domestic routes, 75 of the first and smallest version, with options on later and larger versions.

Boeing went ballistic. It accused Bombardier of “dumping” the jets to Delta by selling each airplane at $14 million below production costs.

Boeing’s formidable Washington lobbying machine swung into action. Dennis Muilenburg, the Boeing CEO, had already cozied up to President Trump by agreeing to cut the costs of the future Air Force One jets. In September 2017, the Commerce Department announced a killing blow to Bombardier, imposing a 300 percent duty on every C Series sold in the U.S.

“ In one stroke Airbus changed the future shape of the airline industry. ”

Given Bombardier’s parlous financial position, this might have been enough to wipe out the company. But Bombardier was being secretly courted by Comac, a Chinese airplane builder that had been struggling for years to produce its own single-aisle jet. To them, Bombardier offered an opening to advanced technology and a base from which to build a sales network in the West.

But on Oct. 16, 2017, to the amazement of the whole aerospace industry, Airbus announced it was taking a 51 percent stake—not in Bombardier itself but in the C Series program. Without any down payment.

In one stroke, Airbus had changed the future of the airline industry. And out-gamed Boeing.

Between them, the Airbus and Boeing duopoly covered every size of airplane except in this category, with between 20 and 30 fewer seats than standard single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. Until now that had been left to Bombardier and the Brazilian company Embraer. But the C Series changed that equation: It introduced the comforts and efficiency of the bigger jets to the smaller.

The president of Airbus, Fabrice Bregier, boasted that now Airbus could offer airplanes seating from 100 to 600 passengers, all with the same sophistication (a boast that should be challenged because the highest number is provided by the A380 superjumbo that is now virtually a dead duck).

The C Series brought another advantage. Unlike Boeing’s 737, its cockpit had state of the art fly-by-wire flight controls that made it compatible with the rest of the Airbus jets, giving it an appeal to the many airlines already flying them.

To ram home just how much Airbus was now able to out-game Boeing, it said it would build a final assembly line for the C Series in Alabama for those sold to American airlines, thereby removing the vulnerability to tariffs. (Many components of the jet were, in any case, made in America, in addition to the engines.)

“ The founder of Jet Blue, David Neeleman, who left the airline in 2007, is so enamored of the A220 that he is planning a new airline based on it. ”

Airbus rebranded the jet as the A220 and in February this year Delta began flying the first of a planned fleet of A220s on U.S. routes. Jet Blue has followed by ordering 60 A220s that, it says, are 40 percent more efficient to operate than the Embraers they replace. There are now more than 500 A220s on order.

The founder of Jet Blue, David Neeleman, who left the airline in 2007, is so enamored of the A220 that he is planning a new airline based on it. As with Jet Blue, this airline could be a disruptor: Neeleman is talking to Airbus about a long-range version that would open up entirely new routes between the U.S. and Europe and the U.S. and South America to serve smaller cities that don’t generate enough traffic for big jets but could be efficiently served only by the A220.

There was one consolation for Boeing and for American aerospace companies in general: China was effectively blocked from gaining an important foothold in North America and a ton of intellectual property.

But the story of Boeing’s failed attempt to sabotage a rival has a larger message.

“ Even though the Dreamliner finally came right and lived up to its name the company lost billions in its development, and its taste for innovation. ”

The mindset that plotted that response to the C Series is the same one that produced by far the most damaging crisis in the company’s history, the grounding of the 737-MAX after two crashes that killed 346 people, combined.

It was well within Boeing’s skills to have produced a jet equal to the C Series. In fact, Boeing had pioneered every innovation used by the Canadians in its 787 Dreamliner: an airframe made of composites instead of metal, a vastly improved cabin climate and amenities, a significant leap in fuel efficiency.

But by concentrating all these advances in one leap, Boeing lost control of the program. The 787 was three years late and way over budget by the time it flew and was then grounded because of fires in its novel main power system that relied on lithium-ion batteries.

Even though the Dreamliner finally came right and lived up to its name—passengers love it for the quiet and airy cabin—the company lost billions in its development, and its taste for innovation.

In 2014, the then CEO Jim McNerney said, “Every 25 years a big moonshot… then produce a 707 or a 787—that’s the wrong way to pursue this business. The more-for-less world won’t let you pursue moonshots.”

Three years earlier McNerney had already acted on that belief. Instead of embarking on an all-new 737, he ordered yet another iteration of a design that had its origins in the 1960s, the MAX. McNerney’s rule was: Re-use old technology and cut costs. As a result, the MAX was an unhappy coupling of a new engine and an airplane that was—to be kind—suboptimal.

In effect, by losing its nerve, Boeing was also in the process of losing its global primacy—a dominance that had been hard won in the first place, not by trying to lock out competitors, but by learning from them and then making one leap ahead.

This happened twice as Boeing came late to the jet age, and it involved one rival company, British-based De Havilland. Britain pioneered military jets in World War II and in the early 1950s De Havilland went on to produce the world’s first jet airliner, the Comet.

De Havilland was basically a small family business and under-capitalized. Each jet was more or less hand-built. A series of early crashes, caused by a structural weakness, hampered the Comet’s acceptance, even though a later version was a success.

Boeing realized that jets, which doubled the speed of air travel, were the future—but the Comet was too small to be efficient for the kind of long-haul routes that were ideal for jets, and that a larger new jet built in Boeing’s far more efficient plants would be a gamble worth taking.

The result was the world’s first really successful long-haul jet, the 707, that first flew in 1957. It set the form for every new jet built by Boeing—and by everyone else.

The same thing happened when De Havilland developed a smaller jet for short-haul routes in Europe, the Trident. Once more it was too small and too inefficiently manufactured. Boeing took its novel design, with three engines mounted at the rear, and turned it into the 727, launched in 1962, that became one of the most common jets in the world.

“ Boeing provides no end of a lesson in how a great company can lose its moxie and with it its primacy because of an indecent lust for short-term gain. ”

In those days, nobody at Boeing thought of these gambles as “moonshots.” They were risks that had to be taken to gain ascendancy and they culminated in 1970 with the 747 jumbo, an airplane that nearly bankrupted the company but ended up as a legend.

Recalling these milestones in aviation history is not a wistful salute to an age of past glories. It’s an indictment of a culture broken by misplaced priorities. As Boeing fell back on risk-averse designs and cost-cutting, it simultaneously adopted a self-enriching policy of stock buybacks and a new focus on quarterly earnings.

And it’s not as though the bean-counting regime has proved effective. As well as the 737-MAX grounding, that has so far cost Boeing around $8 billion, two other programs are dogged by problems.

In 2011 Boeing won a contract to replace the Air Force’s aging fleet of in-flight refueling tankers with the KC-46, a conversion of the 767 airliner. Originally this contract was awarded to a consortium of Northrop Grumman and Airbus, but a blitz of lobbying by Boeing reversed that choice.

The KC-46 has been so crippled by problems that the Air Force says it will be three or four more years before it can perform its mission. It is withholding $28 million from every tanker it receives until the problems are fixed. This September the airplanes so far delivered were rendered useless because their other role, carrying cargo and passengers, was suspended because of an unsafe cargo locking mechanism.

In the meantime, the Airbus tanker that was rejected by the Pentagon is now fully operational with air forces in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.

Then there is the 777X, an update of Boeing’s highly successful big twin-jet. Airlines have ordered 500 of these, but the first flight has been delayed by at least a year, partly because of problems with its General Electric engines, but also with the airplane: It recently failed a certification test when a cargo door blew out.

Boeing provides no end of a lesson in how a great company can lose its moxie because of an indecent lust for short-term gain. It used to be the classic American can-do company. Now it can’t do anything right.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.997187077999115}",neutral,0.997187077999115,0

Go Full Screen When You Watch This Breathtaking Video of The Airbus Perlan II. - The Aviationist,"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTkvMTAvMjIvZ28tZnVsbC1zY3JlZW4td2hlbi15b3Utd2F0Y2gtdGhpcy1icmVhdGh0YWtpbmctdmlkZW8tb2YtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1wZXJsYW4taWkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Incredible Video of Record-Breaking High Altitude Glider Will Take Your Breath Away.

You may not have heard of the remarkable Airbus Perlan II ultra-high altitude glider and its impressive series of ultra-high altitude records for an atmospheric aircraft that happened last September in 2018. This cool video will change that, and we think you’ll be impressed.

The Airbus Perlan II is built to glide up to the edge of space at a projected maximum altitude of 90,000 feet, where there is only about 3% of sea level atmosphere for it to glide on. The unpowered Airbus Perlan II is intended to study the ozone layer and provide reconnaissance of global climate change models.

﻿

Interestingly, and unlike some ultra-high altitude balloon and powered surveillance plane projects, the Airbus Perlan 2 uses a pressurized cockpit. Early flights with pilots wearing high altitude pressure suits like U-2 pilots wear were problematic because of suit expansion in the tight cockpit.

Last September 2, the Airbus Perlan 2 bested its previous altitude record of 73,737 feet when it flew to an amazing 76,000 ft. by riding “standing mountain waves”, or powerful upward-gusting thermal pockets of rising air over the Andes mountains in Argentina. This new 76,000-foot record bested a previous 1989 record for subsonic, manned, winged flight set by a U-2 surveillance aircraft.

The original Perlan project was funded by the late Steve Fossett, who disappeared while flying over the Sierra Nevada mountains in late 2007. The project briefly died following Fossett’s tragic accident, but was revived by Morgan Sandercock, who funded the construction of the current Airbus Perlan II.

In 2010, the first privately-funded astronaut, Dennis Tito, became the pilot of the Airbus Perlan II glider as well as the principle financier funding the project. Shortly thereafter, Airbus Industries came on board as the title sponsor of the Airbus Perlan II missions.

This cool new video was shot using the Garmin VIRB Elite wireless remote action camera and telemetry recorder. A similar Garmin camera is used by the USAF F-35 Demo Team for their in-cockpit video. The Garmin VIRB Elite wireless remote action camera has a unique wide-angle lens, enabling the remarkable views you see in this video. It also records G-forces, altitude and GPS positioning data and uses special mounts for the exterior of an aircraft.

The two fuel-efficient aircraft types will complement Czech Airlines’ existing fleet of six A319 and one A330-300, and allow it to continue extending its network to reach more markets. The airline will also benefit from the commonality of Airbus Family aircraft. The A220-300 will be fitted with 149 seats, while the A321XLR will cater for top comfort in a two-class layout with 195 seats.

“The A220 and A321XLR fit well with our long-term business strategy in terms of network expansion. These aircraft will definitely give Czech Airlines a competitive advantage, and will increase the capacity of our regular flights. I believe that this step will be appreciated by our passengers, as the aircraft offer best in class comfort even during long haul flights thanks to a brand new cabin configuration,” said Petr Kudela, Chairman of the Board of Czech Airlines.

“What a winning combination for Czech Airlines! The A220 has proved to be a strong performer in Europe with its high daily utilisation being a testament to its versatility,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “The A321XLR has the longest range of our A320 Family. Passengers can now fly further without compromising on comfort, whilst Czech Airlines benefits from remarkably lower fuel consumption as it expands its network.”

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and wide-body passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least a 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft. The A220 had an order book of over 525 aircraft at the end of September 2019.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – with 30 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft. To date, the A320neo Family has captured more than 6,650 orders from nearly 110 customers.

Media: Airbus Helicopters, NHIndustries, Christian D. Keller, Finnish Defence Forces, Patrick Heinz, Anthony Pecchi

Today, more than 560 NH90s have been sold in fourteen countries, emphasises Matthieu Louvot, Executive Vice-President of Airbus Helicopters Programmes. ""The last few years have seen Germany opt for the Sea Lion to replace its Sea King and the German Ministry of Defence has already communicated its wish to replace its Sea Lynx with more than thirty NH90s. 2015 saw France order six additional rotorcraft, followed in 2018 by Qatar and this year by Spain."" You don't become a market leader by chance. When the NH90 programme was launched in 1992, the specifications sent to the three partners of the NHIndustries consortium (Eurocopter, AgustaWestland and Fokker) set the bar very high for technical innovations, in particular for developing fly-by-wire (FBW). A first on a series-manufactured helicopter.

NH90: High Level of Flight Quality

""We had to develop an aircraft that had the best flying qualities on the market, and that would meet the needs of all the military missions that could be entrusted to a 10-ton class helicopter on land and sea,"" recalls Jacques Bellera, Head of Airbus Helicopters’ Fly-By-Wire Department. ""To illustrate the extremely high contractual requirement, we had for example, to demonstrate compliance with the highest level of standard ADS33 which is the most comprehensive and most demanding US Army standard regarding the demonstration of flight qualities. To meet all the constraints imposed on the flight control system, we used the fly-by-wire controls in order to provide very high performance piloting assistance while guaranteeing maximum safety due to an optimised system architecture. Despite the very strong constraints, a severely vibrational environment, a limited space and the requirement of redundancy and dissimilarity of the control chains, we achieved our goal. NH90 therefore became the first aircraft in the world to demonstrate Level 1 of standard ADS33 during qualification. This high level of flight quality achieved using fly-by-wire is much appreciated by its pilots throughout its field of use and on all theatres of operation. Beneficial effects have been felt in many areas.""

We had to develop an aircraft that had the best flying qualities on the market, and that would meet the needs of all the military missions that could be entrusted to a 10-ton class helicopter on land and sea.

- Jacques Bellera, Head of Airbus Helicopters’ Fly By Wire Department

On a helicopter equipped with mechanical flight controls, the diamond shape of the fuselage (to reduce the radar detection) as well as the aircraft design (to maximise the interior volume) would have had an impact on the aircraft’s flight characteristics. This is not the case on the NH90. Likewise, reducing the size of the tailplane made it possible to lighten the aircraft and limit impact on attitude during approaches for ship landing. The impact of this smaller tailplane at high speed was fully compensated by the FBW controls which led to optimisation over the entire operational domain, delivering outstanding deck landing performance in the extremely demanding environment of a boat deck subject to high winds and movements.

""Fly-by-wire means that the piloting limits can be approached risk-free, while retaining the margin in power and flyability,"" summarises Didier Delsalle, Airbus NH90 Project experimental test pilot. ""Freed from flying tasks, the pilot can focus on the mission. The NH90 is also a very fast aircraft with an excellent rotor, which remains very controllable throughout its flight envelope. For all the pilots who have tried it, the NH90 combines the power of the Tiger with the agility of the Ecureuil."" A comparison that is much more than an allusion; all the pilots who have used the aircraft in operation can testify to its level of performance. Italian and German rotorcraft in Afghanistan, French ones in the Sahel etc.; at all latitudes and at all altitudes, the NH90 simplifies flying and takes care of its crew. ""Less tired pilots means safer pilots,"" points out Didier Delsalle.

Another example of the value of the aircraft's flight controls is provided by Jacques Bellera: ""The NH90 comes in two cabin heights, the largest developed at the request of the Swedish customer. The stability provided by the FBW controls we have developed is such that pilots can experience the same flying qualities and feel from one helicopter to another. The same goes for all the optional equipment that can be installed on the aircraft in a wide range of missions: torpedoes, missiles, additional tanks etc., since the fly-by-wire absorbs all the alterations in the flight qualities of the aircraft without the pilots experiencing any difference in feel, whatever the environmental conditions (night, downgraded visual conditions, IFR, etc.).""

Fly-by-wire means that the piloting limits can be approached risk-free, while retaining the margin in power and flyability. Freed from flying tasks, the pilot can focus on the mission.

- Didier Delsalle, Airbus NH90 Project experimental test pilot

Standard 2 Project

One of the strengths of the NH90 is that it is continuously updated further to requests made by its 14 customers, for the benefit of the entire community.

Among them, Standard 2, the major update of the NH90 currently under development, responds to this logic. The first requirements relating to this new standard were expressed in 2014 by the French Special Forces. Placed under a bushel for budgetary reasons, Standard 2 resurfaced in 2017 as part of a cooperation with Australia, which was later joined by Belgium.""

""The signing of a development contract between these three countries is now expected for early 2020,"" explains Jean-François Ménière, Head of NH90 Programme Management France and Standard 2 Project. ""France currently has 74 NH90s on order and the last ten are planned to be delivered directly in Standard 2. The Australian and Belgian aircraft, respectively forty-seven and four already delivered, will benefit from a retrofit."" The scope of Standard 2 focuses on the digitisation of the NH90 sensors, i.e., the integration of the Safran EuroFlir™ MSP410D mission ball and its ten integrated multiband sensors, the replacement of the FLIR with fixed distributed sensors, the image merger of which offers a 220° panoramic view. ""These sensors provide a TV and infrared video stream to the two pilots and to tablets that can be used by passengers in the hold,” specifies Jean-François Menière. ""Flight safety will be greatly improved, with a better understanding of the environment in degraded environments. Another advantage is that all the video streams can be recorded and used for debriefing or intelligence purposes."" The scope of Standard 2 also provides for rear section modifications for greater flexibility for the Special Forces. Note that a request for proposal has also been sent to NHIndustries for improvements on the NFH; a major update of this embedded version is also under study. Evidently, the NH90, created at the end of the 20th century, has all the assets to successfully face the 21st century.

Flight safety will be greatly improved, with a better understanding of the environment in degraded environments.

The latest order comprises a mix of A320neo, A321neo and A321XLR aircraft and will take the carrier’s total number of A320neo family orders to 730.

Ronojoy Dutta, IndiGo’s chief executive, described the deal as an “important milestone” and would further strengthen air connectivity in India, as well as boosting economic growth and social mobility.

He added: “India is expected to continue with its strong aviation growth and we are well on our way to build the world’s best air transportation system, to serve more customers and deliver on our promise of providing low fares and a courteous, hassle free experience to them.”

Since its first A320neo aircraft was delivered in March 2016, its fleet of A320neo family aircraft has grown into the world’s largest with 97 A320neo aircraft, operating alongside 128 A320ceos.

Guillaume Faury, Airbus’ chief executive, said: “We are grateful for this strong vote of confidence as this order confirms the A320neo family as the aircraft of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets.”

The A321XLR, unveiled at the Paris Air Show 2019, has a range of up to 4,700nm, with 30 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor jets.

“As we spread our wings and add more destinations, we need to extend the range of our operations and that is why we have added the A321XLR aircraft to our aircraft order,” Dutta added in an email to staff. “We have more growth opportunities than we can meet with our existing fleet of aircraft.”

The addition of more fuel-efficient and longer-range aircraft will enable IndiGo to expand its network beyond its traditional markets. The airline added its first European route in March 2019, with a twice-daily Delhi – Istanbul service, and is understood to be mulling the launch of flights to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi from next year.

The route to Istanbul, which IndiGo operates using 182 seat A320 and 222 seat A321neo aircraft in all-economy class, came after it signed a codeshare agreement with Turkish Airlines.

In addition to the Delhi – Istanbul route, IndiGo carries the TK code on domestic routes in India from Delhi to Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, and from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata.

Turkish Airlines carries IndiGo's 6E code on both of its India routes from Istanbul. It also carried it on routes from Istanbul to a number of European destinations, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London Heathrow and Vienna.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999897480010986}",positive,0.9999897480010986,1

The Airbus Bird of Prey: a 'vision of the future' for aerospace? - Professional Engineering,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1iaXJkLW9mLXByZXktYS0ndmlzaW9uLW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUnLWZvci1hZXJvc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineering news

“I had been watching a buzzard or some other bird of prey, and it just looked so effortless,” says the Airbus job transformation manager. “It could soar for hours and hours.”

Back at work, technological limitations in aerospace were becoming ever clearer. “We are at a point where we are reaching the limit in products, particularly in environmental performance,” he says. Could control systems and other cutting-edge technology bring aircraft closer to a bird’s effortless and efficient gliding?

The Airbus Bird of Prey concept starts to answer that question. Created to inspire a new generation of aeronautical engineers, the design is a “vision of what that future could look like”.

Birds of a feather

Aston discusses birds in cold, clinical language. The animals have “fully active airframes” – their rear bodies are “rear fuselages”. Working alongside colleagues from the Great Britain Campaign, Royal Aeronautical Society, Air League, Institution of Engineering and Technology and Aerospace Technology Institute, Aston was drawn to a particular element of birds’ flight: “They never stay still,” he says. “The reason is, they are always optimising the configuration of their bodies. They are doing it to hold station or minimise drag. If your range depends on how much you eat, you’re going to make sure you can make the most of your fuel.”

With the demands of emissions targets, efficiency is a key aim for future aircraft. But how can engineers achieve that? One option could be to mimic the “multi-functioning devices” of birds’ bodies, rather than discrete elements to control roll, lift and other aspects of flight.

The Bird of Prey’s wing and tail structures mimic those of an eagle or falcon, with individually controlled feathers for active flight control that also minimise drag and noise. The split tail could enable fine control, while the lack of a vertical tail would reduce drag. Other striking features include a blended-wing-to-fuselage joint, mirroring the graceful and aerodynamic arch of a bird of prey.

The regional aircraft would use hybrid-electric propulsion to carry 80 passengers up to 1,500km. A lightweight, carbon-fibre fuselage would use a geodesic structure, inspired by the work of bouncing bomb inventor and aerospace pioneer Sir Barnes Wallis. The distributed propellers offer greater redundancy, as well as extra lift at low speed. The design could cut fuel burn by 30-50%, while being “ultra-quiet” during take-off and landing.

Additive manufacturing could be key in building the Bird of Prey. Although Aston says the technique is increasingly used for applications that cut aircraft weight and cost, it has a long way to go to reach its full potential. It could create hollow metal structures, for example, mimicking birds’ porous skeletons for decreased weight.

Hatching new talent

Could an aircraft resembling the Bird of Prey ever leave the nest? Aston says Airbus could get close but adds: “I think it would be very difficult. You would need far more cooperation among suppliers, engineers… far more integration of disciplines and organisations.”

Technology is not the only issue, he says – we need a new generation of engineers capable of “high-value design”. Aston hopes the Bird of Prey could provide important impetus.

“We need to inspire the next generation to consider a career in engineering, see it as an opportunity.”

"Ethiopian Airlines Close to Airbus A220 Order, May Replace 737 MAX - AirlineGeeks.com","Wed, 09 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE5LzEwLzA5L2V0aGlvcGlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1jbG9zZS10by1haXJidXMtYTIyMC1vcmRlci1tYXktcmVwbGFjZS1tYXgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ News ] By Akhil Dewan

Africa’s largest and most profitable carrier is hoping to finalize its first Airbus A220 order soon. Ethiopian Airlines is reportedly close to a deal for up to 20 Airbus A220 aircraft which could bring more than $1.6 billion to the aircraft manufacturer.

Ethiopian Airlines was one of the airlines affected by the Boeing 737 MAX groundings after Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed earlier this year killing 157 people.

The airline has always had a preference for Boeing, operating 26 737-700 and 800 aircraft, six 767-300ERs, six 777-200LRs, four 777-300ERs and 23 787-8s and -9s. The airline also still has outstanding orders for two additional 737-800s, 28 737-MAX 8s, and seven 787-9s.

Should the A220 deal close, the aircraft will be the second Airbus order the carrier has made after receiving 12 A350-900s and placing orders for an additional 12.

The carrier has also started to receive De Havilland Dash 8-400 turboprops, of which 21 are currently in operation and 9 are on order.

While not confirmed, it is predicted that Ethiopian Airlines plans to use the A220s to resume flights to cities that were scrapped due to the grounding of the MAX.

Affected destinations include Gaborone in Botswana and Windhoek in Namibia.

“The C series is a very good airplane. We have been evaluating it for a long time. Our engineers, pilots, technicians, and economists have studied the aircraft and confirmed that it is fit for purpose for our mission especially in the 100-seat category,” said Ethiopian CEO Tewolde GebreMariam.

In regards to the 737 MAX, Ethiopian is not any closer in deciding if the aircraft will make a return to its fleet. In fact, the carrier may be the last to decide if it should resume operations of the 737 MAX.

“It’s only natural for us to be the last one to decide on the MAX. If we’re convinced the problems are fully addressed, and that the re-certification is done in a collaborative manner with all regulators, then we will take the time, effort and energy to convince our pilots, crew and passengers that the aircraft is safe to get back in the air,” said GebreMariam in an interview.

Author Akhil Dewan An “AvGeek” for most of his life, Akhil has always been drawn to aviation. If there is an opportunity to read about an airline, fly on a new airplane, or talk to anyone about aviation, he is on it. Akhil has been on over 20 different kinds of aircraft, his favorite being the MD-80. Additionally, he has visited 5 continents and plans to knock out the remaining two (Africa and Antarctica) soon. Based in Dallas, Akhil graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Management Information Systems and currently works in consulting.

Airbus H145 arrives in Saskatoon for STARS - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 01 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWgxNDUtYXJyaXZlcy1pbi1zYXNrYXRvb24tZm9yLXN0YXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Sept. 25, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, STARS base received its first Airbus H145 helicopter as part of a fleet renewal project. The aircraft is actually the third H145 delivered under this initiative. With the fleet of BK117s reaching the end of their service life, it was determined that a new aircraft type be purchased to ensure STARS’ ability to continue serving Canada’s prairies. “The Airbus H145 was determined to be the best aircraft to meet our needs and move our organization forward, into the future,” said Andrea Robertson, president and CEO of STARS.

An independent review of the long-term sustainability of STARS indicated a move from a fleet of two aircraft types to one type. This means that STARS’ Leonardo AW139 is also being replaced by the H145. This fleet renewal will help ensure that STARS continues to operate safely and will control costs of overall operations.

Airbus Helicopters Canada president and COO Dwayne Cherette was also in attendance for the H145 welcome ceremony. During his speech, Cherette hailed STARS’ decision to buy the H145 and put its faith in the new aircraft. “By choosing the H145, you have chosen one of the most reliable and flexible aircraft of its type; easily adaptable for any mission.”

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe outlined the importance of STARS, and its ability to carry out its mission in Saskatchewan. “STARS has proven itself time and time again, providing rapid response to our families during medical emergencies, right across this province.” Moe was fortunate to fly in the H145 as a passenger, and before its arrival at the Saskatoon base, the new aircraft landed on the new helipad at the Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital.

Further tying into being based in Saskatchewan, the last three letters of the aircraft’s registration number, LLS, stand for “Land of Living Skies” — the province’s motto.

The fleet renewal will bring in a total of nine H145s, serving STARS’ bases in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Total cost for the renewal is being covered through private donations, corporate sponsorship, as well as funding from the provincial governments of each province.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998971223831177}",neutral,0.9998971223831177,0

Audi puts flying taxi development on hold with Airbus - CNET,"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvYXVkaS1mbHlpbmctdGF4aS1haXJidXMtZHJvbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Audi may not take to the skies nearly as quickly as was once thought. Although the German luxury marque appeared to be headed at full speed toward a making a flying taxi with Italdesign and partner Airbus, those plans are now in limbo.

The company told Roadshow that Audi is ""currently working on a realignment of our urban air mobility activities and [has] not yet made a decision on possible future products."" In this process, it may instead look to ""make the best possible use"" of its ability to work with other companies that are part of Volkswagen Group.

The automaker also reiterated that the PopUp Next concept was never intended for production, but merely served as its first foray into the world of autonomous air taxis. It's a complex machine and became a valuable research tool, according to Audi.

Audi said the company believes it will take ""a very long time"" before this kind of transportation is ready for mass production. Thus, it was time to take a step back.

The decision comes after Porsche , also under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, revealed a Boeing partnership to develop premium air taxi travel. Audi said the Porsche and Boeing partnership will provide mutual benefits and the company is convinced air taxis have a place in future transportation.

The PopUp Next flying taxi, combining an autonomous city car and drone, debuted at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. Developed with France's Airbus, it was presented as a seamless way to go from quick air travel to last-mile movement on the ground with the city car. Audi went as far as signing a letter of intent with city of Ingolstadt to begin tests of the PopUp. Last November, a scale model of the concept made its first successful test flight.

Porsche said in its Boeing partnership announcement last week that an internal study indicated this kind of air travel would pick up in popularity after 2025. Audi, meanwhile, says it will remain in close contact to share information and other project results.

The 3,000-square-meter (32,300-square foot) test house is located in Ottobrunn, near Munich, Germany. Airbus said the 50-million-euro facility will allow it to test the latest electric motors and hybrid-electric engines directly on its own premises, and develop its own low-emission alternative propulsion units.

According to Martin Nüsseler, head of E-Aircraft Systems for Airbus, the EAS House is “where we put the engines through their paces. We can test everything from electric motors for unmanned flying taxis to hybrid-electric engines for the commercial aircraft of the future.”

That includes testing of the electric motor for the E-Fan X, the hybrid-electric aircraft demonstrator being developed by Airbus in partnership with Rolls-Royce and Siemens. Based on a BAe 146, the test aircraft will have one of its four gas turbines replaced with a 2-MW electric motor.

Rolls-Royce is expected to deliver the electric motor to Airbus in early 2020. Once the motor arrives at the EAS House, Airbus said it will undergo rigorous testing in preparation for the E-Fan X’s first flight, scheduled for 2021.

“Is 2 MW enough power? How will altitude and speed affect this power? We need to find solutions to both of these questions, and the EAS House will help us to do so,” explained E-Fan X demonstrator lead Olivier Maillard.

Airbus chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini said the E-Aircraft System House “represents a real competitive advantage for Airbus. With its 3,000-square-meter test area, we now have the infrastructure to move the transition to emission-neutral flight forward at an even faster pace.”

Airbus also recently announced a new battery lab at its Airbus China Innovation Center, which will help develop high-performance and safe battery technology for eVTOL air taxis.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997398257255554}",neutral,0.9997398257255554,0

The training, which will commence in January 2020, includes Type-Rating* as well as long-term Recurrent** training linked to Volotea's growing fleet of Airbus A319s – which will exceed 50 aircraft in 2023. The organisation of the training plan is currently on-going, paving the way for the “go-live” next year.

Volotea’s trainees will benefit from long-term use of Airbus’ full-flight simulators – located throughout Airbus’ Training Centre Network – and will be taught by a pool of expert pilot instructors, drawn from both Airbus and Volotea. The flexible training scheme will benefit from the cross-fertilisation of both Volotea’s and Airbus’ respective expertise and standards. To this end, the airline is initially inducting four of its pilot instructors into Airbus’ training regime, while in parallel, Airbus is aligning around 20 of its own instructors in collaboration with Volotea’s operational requirements. As the airline progressively expands its A319 fleet, the size of the joint instructor pool is expected to commensurably increase. Volotea has selected the Airbus A319 as the model for its planned fleet expansion.

Airbus Services provides state-of-the-art training solutions to ensure safe, reliable and economically-efficient operations on all Airbus aircraft throughout their lifecycle. Airbus is on-hand to offer support every step of the way. A comprehensive and tailored training portfolio is designed and developed by Airbus for airline pilots, cadets, cabin crews, performance & operations engineers, maintenance personnel and structure & repair specialists.

Note for editors:

*Type-Rating is the certification of an airline pilot to fly a certain aircraft “type” (in this case the Airbus A319) which requires additional training beyond the scope of the initial license and aircraft class training.

**Recurrent Training – which is often performed within an airline – is a long-term / ongoing activity for professional pilots. Such periodic training is required to enhance their aviation knowledge and skills, train on new equipment or avionics and to learn new and revised regulations and procedures. These periodic checks are also a regulatory requirement to keep a pilot’s license valid.

Air Austral signs agreement for three Airbus A220 - International Flight Network,"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlmbi5uZXdzL3Bvc3RzL2Fpci1hdXN0cmFsLXNpZ25zLWFncmVlbWVudC1mb3ItdGhyZWUtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French airline Air Austral has signed an agreement with Airbus for the purchase of three Airbus A220-300.

The carrier based on the French island of La Réunion said in a statement that the aircraft would be delivered in November 2020, December 2020 and in March 2021. Additionally, they will serve as a replacement for the carrier’s two Boeing 737-800 and one ATR72-500. No cabin configuration has been announced yet.

Air Austral was founded in 1974 as Réunion Air Services and initially served as a regional inter-island carrier for the French overseas territories in the Indian Ocean.

On December 14th 2015, Volotea officially announced in Toulouse its decision to select the Airbus A319 as the model for its ambitious fleet growth plan. On March 9th 2016, the first aircraft was received and a celebration event and maiden flight welcomed the first delivery of this model. Today, Volotea operates 19 Airbus A319, after incorporating six units in 2019 for capitalizing its growth in operations.

Volotea’s total fleet includes 36 aircraft to serve 319 routes in more than 80 cities. With these additions Volotea continues its progress to have a full Airbus fleet by 2022.

All these aircraft go through a reconfiguration process before starting their commercial operation at Volotea, in cooperation with Airbus Support Services. Volotea has been partnering with Airbus for aircraft modificationssince the introduction of the Airbus A319 in its fleet. Such modifications include cabin reconfigurations to install LED lighting, but also to upgrade avionics and other systems with the latest available specifications, for which Airbus Support Services is Volotea’s preferred partner.

Cabin reconfigurations on Volotea’s A319 aircraft are carried out to install 156 top quality reclining seats, arranged in rows 5% wider than European standards in order to increase passengers’ comfort onboard. Volotea seats have been awarded with the Best Seat recognition in the 2018 Hamburg fair.

All the A319 aircraft in Volotea’s fleet are also enrolled in the most advanced Airbus fuel saving programmes, including the Descend Profile Optimisation software. Volotea’s A319 aircraft are in the process of migrating to the new Skywise Health Monitoring application.

Additionally, Volotea A319 pilots are going to be trained in cooperation with Airbus thanks to a recently signed exclusive training programme that would allow both companies to leverage on their specific know-how to advance the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of pilot training. Other initiatives combining training and the Skywise platform features are currently being considered between Volotea and Airbus.

“We are very proud to have been selected by Airbus for their charter service connecting the Toulouse and Hamburg Finkenwerder sites. This is evidence of the trust, reliability and excellent cooperation between Airbus and Volotea” said Carlos Muñoz, Founder and CEO of Volotea.

“We are proud to see Volotea as the new provider of the charter service for Airbus’ double daily flights between its largest production sites in Toulouse and Hamburg,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus. “Our versatile A319 is perfectly suited to this high-demand-short-haul route.
