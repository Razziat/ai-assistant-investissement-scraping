Airbus A380 Goes to Antartica - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 04 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMC8wMS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1nb2VzLXRvLWFudGFydGljYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 is an amazing aircraft. Antarctica is an amazing continent. 2010 was the end to an amazing decade. Put them all together and what do you get? One amazing party.

A Qantas Airbus A380 celebrated the New Year by taking 450 lucky folks to the southern most part of the world. The A380 left Melbourne on Thursday afternoon with 24 crew members, passengers and even a jazz band and returned Friday morning, never having to fly in darkness due to being so far south.

This was the 40th Antarctica sight-seeing trip for Captain John Dennis. Previous trips have normally been done in Boeing 747’s, but this was the first time it has been done in the Airbus A380. “Every single flight we do, it’s hard to get the grin off your face. Pictures can’t do it justice. It’s so vast,” Dennis said.

The cheapest ticket was just over $900.00 USD and the most expensive was around $5500.00 USD. To the average person, it might seem silly to pay so much for a flight that goes no where, but as an aviation nerd, that sounds like a good deal. I think I just added a new thing to my “Do Before I Die” list…

Airbus threatens to scrap A400M aircraft - CNN,"Tue, 05 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDEwL0JVU0lORVNTLzAxLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy5taWxpdGFyeS5hNDAwbS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(FT) -- Airbus is threatening to scrap its €20bn ($28.8bn) programme to build the A400M military aircraft, Europe's most high profile defence project, unless governments agree to come up with more money for it before the end of this month.

""We need to stop this constant drain on resources,"" an Airbus spokesman said on Tuesday. ""We've asked the governments to take their share of the burden and this needs to be done as soon as possible.""

Analysts warned that abandoning the programme would be costly for the aircraft maker, which would have to repay €5.7bn in development funding under the original programme contract, and could hurt its reputation for reliably delivering aircraft.

The much delayed and over-budget A400M aircraft, which finally flew for the first time just last month, has become a source of friction between Airbus and the European governments that have backed it since its launch nearly seven years ago.

Tensions have worsened in recent months as Airbus and its parent, EADS, have tried to persuade the governments to share the extra costs that have arisen thanks to the technical problems and delays afflicting the programme.

After EADS missed a key deadline to fly the aircraft earlier this year, putting it in breach of its contract, the parties came to a ""standstill"" agreement under which Airbus kept working on the A400M while funding and delivery negotiations continued.

There have been three extensions of the negotiations over the last 10 months, but no agreement has been reached, leaving Airbus to bear costs of around €100m a month.

The company spokesman said this meant the A400M was eating up ""scarce engineering resources"" that could have been diverted to Airbus's civil aircraft production arm.

He said the company had done its part during the standstill period by solving the technical issues and getting the aircraft into the air and now it was time for the governments to share the burden.

The manufacturer threw down an ultimatum to the governments on December 31, people familiar with the situation in Airbus and EADS said today, saying this would be the last extension of negotiations.

EADS estimates the program will cost a further E11.3bn to complete, making the total cost of the programme E31bn.

Of this, the company wants the partner governments -- Germany, France, the UK, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Turkey - to accept a 25 per cent price increase, or E5.3bn.

EADS, which has already taken a hit of E2.4bn, will then absorb the extra risk cost of E3.6bn, whch they hope to bring down by running the programme more efficiently.

Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive, is looking at pulling out of the programme if agreement is not reached by the end of January, however the company is still some way away from this point and any final decision would be taken by EADS.

Rather, the company is trying to force Germany, one of the more reluctant partner governments, to focus on the funding issue.

""As a responsible head of Airbus, Tom Enders will decide how to secure the long term future of the company. A constant loss-making program is not healthy,"" the Airbus spokesman said.

Despite Britain's reputation for scuppering collaborative procurement projects, the German government has consistently taken the most hard-line in negotiations with EADS, demanding that the company stick to contractual agreements.

German defence officials note that the country has strict rules mandating parliamentary approval to sign or amend significant contracts.

In 2002 the project was held up for a year while the partners waited for the German parliament to give the go-ahead.

Still, a spokesman for the German defence ministry said Tuesday that it remained committed to A400M programme negotiations with Airbus and hoped to secure an agreement by the end of January.

""We stick to the moratorium agreement and continue to clarify the necessary details for a continuation of the program with the industry until the end of the month,"" he told Dow Jones Newswires.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9997619986534119}",negative,0.9997619986534119,-1

But the officials said they would resume negotiations next week in Berlin in the hope of meeting a Jan. 31 deadline.

Many of the participating countries need the aircraft urgently as they play a greater and more demanding role in peacekeeping missions. The repeated delays  the A400M is now more than four years behind schedule  represent a big setback for European military cooperation.

Sully's 'Miracle on the Hudson' Airbus For Sale - WIRED,"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEwLzAxL3N1bGx5cy1taXJhY2xlLW9uLXRoZS1odWRzb24tYWlyYnVzLWZvci1zYWxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For sale: Jet plane, slightly used. One previous owner. No longer air (or sea) worthy, but a unique artifact in annals of modern aviation history. Last flight a mere 23 minutes. Last pilot a national hero. Provenance indisputable.

That isn't exactly the listing but it might as well be: The US Airways Airbus 320 that Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed in the Hudson River a year ago is for sale. The insurance company that took possession of it after paying off the policy is looking to unload it.

The auction — ""As Is/Where Is (New Jersey),"" Chartis Insurance Group is compelled to disclose — does not include the airliner's engines or avionics, and the lot is somewhat in pieces. But apart from that it seems to be surprisingly intact for a craft that hit the water at a normal touchdown speed with ad hoc landing gear comprising the entire fuselage and wings — which, by the way supported all 155 people aboard as they safely deplaned and awaited rescue craft on the frigid Hudson.

The offering page is remarkably bland, not even considering the high drama surrounding the most famous water landing ever. Under the formal description of the accident, it says: ""Aircraft suffered severe bird strike event resulting in water emergency landing."" The description of the damage is simple: ""Severe water damage throughout airframe. Impact damage to underside of aircraft.""

The craft itself is described as ""1999 AIRBUS A320-214"" and nowhere on the page is even the most oblique mention of the significance of this particular piece of aviation salvage.

Of course this sort of salesmanship may mute objections that Chartis should profit even from what was the happily ended tragedy of flight 1549. The company most likely will not recoup its payout (well, not with this kind of low-pressure pitch) and has a fiduciary responsibility to mitigate the loss it incurred from paying US Airways for its loss.

For the record, no reserve is listed, and bids will be accepted through March 27. Chances are nobody will get this bird for a song, but if you are the winning bidder you have a month to move it before they start collecting rent.

And guys, if you're really serious about selling this plane, we have two words for you: e Bay.

Future sought for Airbus military transport plane - Colorado Springs Gazette,"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9mdXR1cmUtc291Z2h0LWZvci1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnktdHJhbnNwb3J0LXBsYW5lL2FydGljbGVfOGVjMDhjZTMtZmE2OC01Yzk2LTgxNWItODVmY2IxNTVmZjFjLmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1zb3VnaHQtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS10cmFuc3BvcnQtcGxhbmUvYXJ0aWNsZV84ZWMwOGNlMy1mYTY4LTVjOTYtODE1Yi04NWZjYjE1NWZmMWMuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN — Nations that have ordered Airbus' A400M military transport plane met Tuesday with parent company EADS before a weekend deadline to find a solution to the troubled project, an official said.

The negotiations in Berlin were the third round of talks in as many weeks. The manufacturer wants a decision by the end of the month.

EADS is urging the seven customer nations — Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey — to increase their funding for the aircraft's construction, which is now four years behind schedule and more than euro5 billion ($7.08 billion) over budget.

The meeting at the German Defense Ministry lasted for five hours but ended in the evening with no conclusion, a ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity in line with department policy.

He said the two sides had agreed to continue the talks soon, but said no details on location or timing had yet been worked out.

He gave no further details of the meetings, and an EADS spokesman also declined comment.

The industry delegation was led by EADS CEO Louis Gallois and the chief of its plane-making subsidiary, Airbus, Tom Enders, a source close to the negotiations told the AP on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.

Featured Local Savings

Germany's Defense Ministry declined to comment on a report Tuesday in the Financial Times Deutschland that Germany was offering a loan guarantee to EADS instead of fresh money. The report cited unidentified sources close to the negotiations.

German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg has said his country ""wants the A400M, but not at any price.""

The defense officials and the industry are trying to reach a compromise on Airbus' claim that it can't afford to produce 180 planes under the original, fixed-price contract from 2003.

EADS has given the customer governments until the end of January to decide upon the funding. It is far from clear whether such a deadline can be met.

The A400M had its maiden flight last month. The four-engine turboprop is seen as inhabiting an important niche market between the Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules, which carries only half the payload, and Boeing's C-17 Globemaster III, which is larger, costlier, and less tactically versatile.

Flight-testing of aircraft MSN001 began on 11 December, and the aircraft had made five flights by 13 January, all from Airbus Military's final assembly plant near Seville, Spain. Airbus's flight-test chief Fernando Alonso says the A400M's flight envelope was cleared in the early test flights: ""We've flown it at its VMO and MMO of 300kt [555km/h] and Mach 0.72.""

Alonso says MSN001 is due to be grounded shortly after an expected seven flights, to undergo installation of additional test and calibration equipment. As it is tasked with aircraft handling testing, it will also be equipped with rockets to assist in emergency recoveries during stall tests.

""The rockets are an alternative to the [aircraft] parachutes sometimes used when stall-testing T-tailed aircraft,"" he says. ""They will be able to give us a 'push up the butt' if it gets into a high nose-up attitude.""

After the equipment upgrade, MSN001 will be positioned to Airbus's main flight-test centre in Toulouse, France, where it is due to be based for the bulk of its tasks along with MSNs 003 and 006.

Preparations are under way to fly the next A400M, MSN002, which is due to get airborne in March and will be tasked with performance and powerplant tests. This aircraft and MSN004 will be based in Seville for testing, although Alonso says all test aircraft can operate from either centre to obtain the optimum weather conditions.

United Airlines Airbus A319 had only minor damage after emergency landing: official - New York Daily News,"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEwLzAxLzExL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTMxOS1oYWQtb25seS1taW5vci1kYW1hZ2UtYWZ0ZXItZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctb2ZmaWNpYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The United Airlines jet that made a lopsided emergency landing at Newark Airport on Sunday suffered only minor damage, officials said Monday.

The Airbus A319 miraculously skidded to a safe stop on the runway on just its nose and left landing gear.

It lurched onto one side, shooting sparks as its engine dragged on the tarmac, but none of the 53 passengers and crew members aboard were injured during the dramatic 9:30 a.m. touchdown at one of the nation’s busiest airports.

The 68-ton bird was moved off the runway about 5:45 a.m. Monday so it could be inspected by the national Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and United Airlines.

“There was only minor damage,” said FAA spokesman Jim Peters, adding that the right engine covering and wing will need repairs.

The agencies will investigate why the right landing gear didn’t come down and lock into place.

The NTSB will also review the jet’s flight data recorder. There is no time line for when the investigation will wrap up, Peters said. “Certainly it’s everyone’s intention to do a thorough job that’s as complete as possible so we understand what happened,” he said.

Passengers broke into cheers and applause on Sunday when the plane came to a safe stop. United Flight 634 from Chicago had been routine until it approached Newark, its final destination.

“The pilot did a beautiful job,” said passenger Jim Falk, 40, of Middletown, N.J. “He should be commended.”

Passengers were prepared for landing when the plane suddenly began ascending and started circling the airport.

“Normally a big plane like that doesn’t do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong,” said Falk, who was sitting near the front.

“Brace! Brace! Brace!” the pilot said over the intercom as passengers buried their heads in their laps poised for a crash landing. Falk and other passengers said the landing was “unbelievably smooth” considering the plane’s condition.

He said the crew remained incredibly calm.

“They did a great job,” Falk said. “There was no yelling, screaming, panicking or anything.”

Passengers quickly evacuated the jet, sliding down to terra firma via emergency chutes. Fearful the plane might explode, passengers ran quickly away from the jet after exiting, Falk said.

United Airlines officials said the flight left Chicago at about 6 a.m. and the crew complained of no problems until the very end.

The names of the pilot and cockpit crew have not been released, pending interviews with flight investigators.

It could be the ultimate souvenir for any of the 150 passengers who survived the famous Miracle on the Hudson - so long as they have a big enough garage.



A salvage yard in New Jersey is auctioning the plane that hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger landed safely on the New York river last January after a bird strike destroyed both its engines.

The U.S. Airways Airbus A320 is being sold ‘as is’, and is listed on an insurance broker’s website with ‘severe water damage throughout the airframe’ and ‘significant damage to the underside of the aircraft’.

For sale: U.S. Airways has said repairing the 11-year-old jet would be too costly



'Water damage': The U.S. Airways plane is being auctioned after its emergency landing in the Hudson River in New York in January last year



The airline decided that it would not be worth the cost of repairing the 11-year-old jet plane, which took its last flight from New York’s La Guardia airport as Flight 1549 to Charlotte, North Carolina.

Minutes after take-off the plane struck a flock of geese, causing an immediate total loss of thrust on both engines.



Quick-thinking Sullenberger became a hero when he glided the stricken plane down to a water landing on the Hudson River.

'Salvage': The plane, expected to reach up to £1.6m, will not fly again



All 150 passengers and five crew survived the impact and were ferried to safety from the wings of the plane, which remained afloat.

It was hauled from the river by heavy-lift cranes several days after the crash landing and taken away for inspection by the National Transport Safety Board.

Industry experts valued the plane at £25million before the accident but say that the sale price at auction will be substantially less, given that the engines are missing and both wings have been detached. Passengers were ferried to safety from the plane wings, which stayed afloat

Rescue mission: All 150 passengers and five crew onboard the plane survived

No guide price was given, but a similar, scrapped Airbus A310 sold for £1.6million last year, according to Metal Bulletin Monthly, which monitors scrap metal prices. The plane is to be sold ‘as salvage’ and will not fly again, according to Marie Ali, a spokesman for Chartis International, the brokers handling the sale.

Pictures on the brokers’ website show the interior of the cabin in a tatty condition, with many cushions missing because they were removed by the passengers for use as flotation aids. Hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger landed the plane safely on the New York river

Tatty condition: Cushions are missing from seats - used as floats by passengers



The auction ends on March 27 and was arranged through U.S. Airways’ insurers, AIG. Interested parties must submit sealed bids and the winner must collect the plane from the salvage yard in Kearny, New Jersey, by April 10.

Five passengers were seriously hurt in the crash, but recovered. Many of the survivors, including Sullenberger, 57, attended a reunion last Friday on the first anniversary.

‘It was like the best high school reunion you could imagine,’ Sullenberger said. Sold 'as is': The jet is described as having 'significant damage' after the incident



‘We have so much to be grateful for, and it’s absolutely wonderful to have a chance to celebrate such a wonderful outcome with this great group of people.

‘I feel like I’ve lived 10 normal lifetimes in this past year.’



Romance also blossomed between two passengers in the aftermath of the landing.



Software developer Ben Bostic, 39, met Laura Zych, 31, hit it off at another reunion last summer, having sat only rows apart on the flight but never having spoken.



Neither U.S. Airways nor Chartis would comment on the sale.

All 48 passengers and five crew aboard United Flight 634 from Chicago O’Hare (ORD) escaped uninjured.

While on approach to Newark, the crew discovered that the right main gear would not deploy properly. After circling for about 30 minutes while unsuccessfully attempting to resolve the problem, passengers were informed of the malfunction and instructed to prepare for a crash landing.

The left main gear was the first to touch down, followed by the nose wheel, before the laws of gravity forced the right engine into the surface of Runway 4L. Sparks and smoke ensued as the metal scraped along the tarmac, but the aircraft continued on a straight line and there was no fire as the plane came to a safe stop.

Passengers were evacuated and transported to the terminal on buses. Traveler Paul Lasiuk of Chicago told the NY Times, “I’ve had a lot of worse landings at Newark before, it was unbelievably smooth.”

The airport was shut down completely for about 20 minutes following the incident, and Runway 4L/22R was closed for the remainder of the day as investigators inspected the aircraft before moving it. Delays of over an hour were reported, and some flights were diverted to nearby airports, including an American Airlines 737-800 which made a rare visit to JFK Airport.

The Persian Gulf Emirate of Qatar, together with Qatar Airways, Qatar Science and Technology Park and Petroleum Company have started a new biofuel project to power commercial airliners, including large ones such as Airbus.

As noted in a Gulf Times article, along with Qatar’s own air transport and technology concerns, the Emirate has also enlisted the cooperation of the giant European Airbus consortium to be a partner in this venture, which will work towards a sustainable Biomass to Liquid (BTL) aviation fuel.

We’ve already noted some promising bio-fuel projects taking place in and around the Middle East, including one taking place out of bacteria from a salt lake in Iran using the microalgae, Chamydomonas. Another project, involving a company named MME New Diesel, will help provide a “bio-link” between Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians. Biofuel can be good for the environment and peaceful cooperative endeavours.

The Qatar bio jet fuel project will operate as the Qatar Airways Bio-fuel Project (QABP), created by Qatar Airways after researching sustainable biomass-to-liquid jet fuel projects and possible by-products such as bio diesel. The project is in partnership with the US-based Verno Systems, a company providing advisory and management services in the advanced biofuel industry.

Qatar Airways CEO, Sheikh Akbar Al-Baker, said:

“QABP will initiate activities in preparing a detailed engineering and implementation plan for economically viable and sustainable bio fuel production, bio fuel investment strategy, advanced technology development program and ongoing market and strategic analysis.”

Scientists working on the project stress the importance of developing specific biofuel feed stocks that will not affect the food and fresh water supply chain. Though not specifically noted in the article, the use of biofuels such as algae could be a great benefit as these forms of algae can be grown in salt lakes and marshes, sewage waste water and other aquatic sources where these forms of algae would ordinarily be considered as a nuisance, with no viable value.

Qatar Airways was in the news last October when one of its airliners made a successful flight powered by a gas-to-liquid fuel blend. Although the outcome of this biofuel project will be very beneficial to Qatar Airways, the resulting fuels developed will be very useful to other airline companies as well.

As noted by Sheikh Al Baker:

“Everyone is concerned about environment protection, and Qatar Airways has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry and is getting closer to the ‘much talked about’ carbon neutral growth.”

Although Qatar Airways has both Boeing and Airbus passenger airlines in its fleet, Sheikh Al-Baker stressed the importance of Airbus’ interest in the project and noted that in the development of projects for alternative fuels, Airbus has been more interested in this subject than Boeing.

The aircraft that Capt. Sullenberger gracefully landed in the Hudson River a year ago is now for sale at auction!

According to Wired, the US Airways Airbus 320 was taken into possession by the insurance company Chartis, who are now looking to unload it. Currently in Kearny, NJ — the craft comes in quite a bit of pieces; check out the lot on the auction page. And as the site points out, the formal description on the page doesn't do justice to what the plane was a part of. It simply says: ""Aircraft suffered severe bird strike event resulting in water emergency landing."" And buyer beware! There's ""severe water damage throughout airframe.""

Whoever may purchase the plane won't be able to fly it — on top of it being sort of a ""fixer-upper,"" there are no engines or avionics. While no price is listed, the NY Post points out a similar Airbus A310 recently went for $2.6 million, and yielded $4 million after being sold off piece by piece. And maybe they could get a better price if they had Sully autograph it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966654181480408}",neutral,0.9966654181480408,0

Airbus sees lifespan of at least 10 years for re-engined A320 - Flightglobal,"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNlZXMtbGlmZXNwYW4tb2YtYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAteWVhcnMtZm9yLXJlLWVuZ2luZWQtYTMyMC85MTQwNS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is confident that if it goes ahead with its proposed A320 re-engining, the updated model would have a production lifespan of at least 10 years.

The airframer has also urged International Aero Engines and its partner Pratt & Whitney to devise a way of offering the latter's PW1000G geared turbofan through the consortium, as an alternative to the CFM International Leap-X advanced turbofan.

John Leahy, who is Airbus's chief operating officer customers, says that the proposed new A320 could be in service by 2015 and that any all-new single-aisle aircraft is unlikely to arrive before 2024-25. ""With re-engined aircraft there is usually an overlap of a few years with the new aircraft - this is what Boeing did with the 737NG - so it will have a life of at least 10 years.""

Meanwhile, chief executive Tom Enders says Airbus will ""take a decision on the re-engining this year"". Speaking during its annual press conference in Seville, Enders added that the airframer will also decide ""what the engine solutions will be"".

The Leap-X advanced turbofan and the PW1000G are being evaluated, and Enders repeated Airbus's previous statement that it wants an offer from its existing A320 supplier IAE.

Leahy stresses that Airbus is not interested in a sole-source deal with P&W for the GTF, and urges the US engine maker to get together with its IAE partners - which include Rolls-Royce - to ""work out a way for IAE to offer the GTF"".

Although the airframer wants ""multiple suppliers"" for the new engines, Leahy does not rule out signing a deal later this year first with CFM ""if Pratt and IAE aren't ready"".

Airbus begins drive to simplify 'over-complex' A380 production - Flightglobal,"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJlZ2lucy1kcml2ZS10by1zaW1wbGlmeS1vdmVyLWNvbXBsZXgtYTM4MC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLzkxMzg0LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has begun a drive to speed up the A380's ""over-complex"" assembly process through improved quality control and by allocating engineering support to the production line to resolve problems more quickly.

""A380 production costs are still significantly above expectations and deliveries ramp-up is still difficult to manage,"" said EADS boss Louis Gallois at the company's joint press conference with Airbus in Seville. He stressed that the situation is improving, but conceded that ""we are not out of the woods yet"".

Airbus chief executive Tom Enders concedes that in 2009 Airbus ""did not achieve the 18 A380 deliveries we wanted to achieve"". The airframer completed 10 deliveries - although part of the deficit was due to customer deferrals that caused some ""turmoil of rescheduling"". However, Enders warns that the giant will remain a ""financial liability"" for ""years to come"".

Following an ""internal bottom-up review"", the production issues have been addressed through more focused quality control and focused engineering support for the production line. ""Our target is clearly to deliver at least 20 A380s in 2010,"" says Enders.

As part of the drive to speed up production, new processes will be implemented that will require a ""change of mindset"", says chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier. ""What we call 'stop and fix'.""

To enable the issue of travelled work between plants to be resolved more quickly, Airbus wants production teams to ensure that equipped sections are fully tested before they are despatched to the assembly line.

Improved harmony of quality inspections will see teams headed by a single manager to avoid unnecessary, timewasting duplication. Stronger engineering teams will be deployed to solve small problems ""on the spot"", says Bregier, rather than up to two weeks.

He is confident the revamp will allow the airframer to boost monthly output to two A380s in the second half of the year.

Airbus: 'zero major issues' from A400M flight tests - Flightglobal,"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXplcm8tbWFqb3ItaXNzdWVzLWZyb20tYTQwMG0tZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3RzLzkxNTg4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military's first A400M has entered a roughly one-month modification period, after completing its first seven test flights and spending more than 30h in the air.

Work to prepare aircraft MSN001 for its next phase of flight-envelope proving activities should resume in mid-February, with the transport likely to be moved to its main test centre in Toulouse, France at the end of its next sortie.

""We are probably about 30% through our first phase of testing, and today there are zero major issues,"" says Fernando Alonso, Airbus's senior vice-president flight and integration test. Noting that the company's multinational test team has already cleared the A400M's normal flight envelope, he adds: ""we have good foundations.""

© Craig Hoyle/Flight International

Airbus had originally hoped to log around 40 flight hours in the month following MSN001's 11 December first flight, but unusually poor weather conditions in Seville, Spain, restricted flight opportunities. The aircraft cannot currently be flown into clouds, or taxied through standing water, due to the strain gauges attached to its Ratier-Figeac propellers.

The programme's first of five flight test aircraft has so far been flown to an altitude of 34,000ft (10,400m) - 6,000ft below its planned maximum operating ceiling - and from stall warning to its top speed of 300kt (555km/h).

Sideslip testing to assess the behaviour of its airframe and propulsion system has been performed at up to 6° at 250kt and 15° at 130kt, with ""blade stress and engine intake distortion well within limits"", says Airbus chief test pilot military Ed Strongman.

""For the number of hours we've flown we've been tremendously productive,"" says Strongman. ""We have collected a huge amount of data across a wide spectrum of the flight envelope.""

Other work performed during recent flights has included extending the aircraft's emergency ram air turbine, and deploying its air data calibration equipment along a tail-housed trailing cone to assess the aerodynamic effects of various flap settings and landing gear positions.

Some buffeting has been encountered as the nose landing gear's front door is opened, and fixes previously implemented on the Airbus A340 and Beluga designs are being considered to rectify this. Disrupted airflow has also been found to affect the rear of the aircraft while its main landing gear is down.

The propulsion system's full authority digital engine control software has performed ""quite well"", according to Strongman, with a minor software problem which had affected one channel having been traced and a work-around procedure established. The aircraft's auxiliary power unit has also been used in flight to restart both the inboard and outboard engines, and pre-test concerns over its operating temperature have proved unfounded. The APU exhaust chimney above the starboard wing could be lowered, or removed entirely following the test results.

MSN001 has so far logged 311h of engine operations and over 130 engine starts, including while performing 40 rejected take-offs to gather data on the operation of the TP400 and the A400M's braking system.

Once it resumes testing, Alonso says the aircraft will begin to explore the ""peripheral areas"" of its handling qualities, including stall and deep stall investigations. It is currently being equipped with a rocket in its tail, which could be fired for around 5s if required to help its pilots recover it from a deep stall.

Other modifications to be introduced include replacing part of the rear nacelle above the Europrop International TP400-D6 engine's tail cone. This fix was successfully trialled on one engine during the sixth test flight to resolve an overheating issue encountered during some ground operations. A small structural and software change will also be made to enable the aircraft's cargo ramp to be opened during flight.

Meanwhile, MSN002 will be handed over to the flight test team in the third week of February, with the aircraft likely to fly for the first time by March.

The French Polynesia flag carrier has five Airbus A340-300

French Polynesia’s flag carrier has signed a deal with the British Defense Ministry to fly military personnel from England to the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, according to Radio New Zealand International.

The head of Air Tahiti Nui, Christian Vernaudon, said Wednesday one of its Airbus planes with its crew has been leased to fly the military personnel this month. He told local radio in Tahiti that this type of activity is possible because the airline has five Airbus planes at its disposal.

Vernaudon said contracts of this type have already been signed worth almost 10 million US dollars.

In London a military spokesperson said that the MOD contractor is meeting its contractual commitment in providing the South Atlantic Airbridge service following the collapse of FlyGlobespan and it is hoped that a permanent arrangement will be in place soon.

The present interim arrangements are: Air Tahiti Nui is contracted for the flights between the UK to Falkland Islands on 6th, 10th and 13th of January and Titan will undertake the task on the 17th January.

The spokesperson says that competition to provide the flights between the 20th January and the end of February is ongoing at present.

Air Tahiti Nui has headquarters in Papeete and operates from Faa’a International Airport on the island of Tahiti. The company was founded in 1996 and commenced flight operations in 1998. The Government of French Polynesia is the major shareholder in the airline along with Tahitian private investors.

Air Tahiti Nui is certified under the French Civil Aviation Authority and is designated by the IATA code “TN”, numeric code “244”, and the ICAO three-letter code “THT”.

Air Tahiti Nui exclusively operates one of the youngest fleets of Airbus A340-300 aircraft in the world. These new generation aircraft, which seat 294 passengers, feature the quietest cabin in the sky while offering state-of-the-art technology and innovation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0

Prosecutors in Augsburg, Germany, accuse Schreiber of failing to declare millions from kickbacks he is said to have received for the sale of helicopters to Canada's coast guard and Airbus planes to Air Canada in the 1980s, as well as airliners to Thailand and tanks to Saudi Arabia.

German businessman Karlheinz Schreiber arrives at a courtroom in Augsburg, southern Germany, on Monday to face charges of tax evasion, breach of trust and accessory to fraud. ((Matthias Schrader/AP)) Schreiber, 75, a former arms-industry lobbyist, also faces charges of breach of trust and accessory to fraud.

In Canada, Schreiber became involved in controversial dealings with former prime minister Brian Mulroney, who served from 1984 to 1993. Schreiber claimed Mulroney agreed to take money from him while still in office. Mulroney has denied wrongdoing, though he acknowledged accepting $225,000 Cdn in cash from Schreiber after leaving politics.

Although no formal pleas are entered in the German system, Schreiber's lawyer, Jan Olaf Leisner, told the court his client rejects all charges against him, insisting that the political context of the deals has not been taken into consideration.

""The tone was set by high-ranking politicians,"" Leisner said.

Allegations that Schreiber gave cash to the treasurer of former German chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in 1991 triggered a scandal that deepened with Kohl's 1999 admission that he had personally accepted off-the-books — and therefore illegal — donations from supporters. Kohl was Germany's chancellor from 1982 to 1998.

If found guilty, Schreiber faces up to 10 years in prison. He was arrested in Canada in 1999 under a German warrant seeking his extradition. He was released on bail from a Canadian jail in late 2007, and last August he was sent to Germany after losing a 10-year battle against extradition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9502594470977783}",neutral,0.9502594470977783,0
Superjumbo flights open new era of Antarctic tourism - Sydney Morning Herald,"Sat, 09 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL3N1cGVyanVtYm8tZmxpZ2h0cy1vcGVuLW5ldy1lcmEtb2YtYW50YXJjdGljLXRvdXJpc20tMjAxMDAxMDctbHdqaS5odG1s0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS90cmF2ZWxsZXIvaW5zcGlyYXRpb24vc3VwZXJqdW1iby1mbGlnaHRzLW9wZW4tbmV3LWVyYS1vZi1hbnRhcmN0aWMtdG91cmlzbS0yMDEwMDEwNy1sd2ppLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The enormous aircraft - holding 450 passengers on two levels - flew a New Year's Eve sightseeing flight, leaving Melbourne (via Sydney) at 6.10pm and returning about 13 hours later. The next A380 Antarctica flight is on January 24 from Sydney over the South Pole. A Boeing 747 flight flies from Melbourne to the edge of Antarctica on February 14.

The flights are run by Croydon Travel's Antarctica Sightseeing Flights, which has been in the business since 1994, chartering aircraft from Qantas. Prices range from $999 in economy to more than $6000 in first class. Seats in eight classes are sold and those with a window are asked to be generous in sharing their views. Airline meals are served and alcohol is available. No passports are required (although photo ID is) despite the flight being deemed international.

The Antarctica flights travel over Tasmania and the Southern Ocean before skirting the edge of the Antarctic continent's coastal cliffs near the French research base at Dumont d'Urville, continuing inland in figure-of-eight patterns over glaciers. The exact route depends on the weather and visibility. The travel company says it has 19 approved flight paths, meaning the pilot can change route depending on conditions.

Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Ian Allison goes on most of the flights to act as a commentator and to tell passengers what they are seeing out the window. He's been doing so for 12 years and has worked on the ice since 1969. He knows it's a party plane and that detailed science about the continent would go over people's heads but his outlook is simple: ""If a few people do this and get inspired to want to preserve Antarctica and get inspired about our global environment and the amazing world we live in then that's fine by me.""

He says even a brief look at the edge of Antarctica has the capacity to shift perspectives. ""You can see these extraordinary glaciers which are rivers of ice but if you see them as river and the continent as a land mass you can begin to understand how it all works,"" he says. ""Seeing Antarctica reinforces the idea that we are one globe and one environment.""

Air New Zealand and Qantas began offering sightseeing flights over the Antarctic in February 1977. But after an Air New Zealand flight crashed into Mount Erebus in 1979 - killing all 257 people on board - both airlines stopped the flights. Qantas started again in 1994. Air New Zealand has not.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999957084655762}",neutral,0.9999957084655762,0

Cuba to give Canada more air access to boost tourism - CTV News,"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvY3ViYS10by1naXZlLWNhbmFkYS1tb3JlLWFpci1hY2Nlc3MtdG8tYm9vc3QtdG91cmlzbS0xLjQ3NDI1NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OTTAWA - The federal government has reached a new agreement with Cuba's communist regime that will give Canadian airlines expanded access to the Caribbean island's sunny skies.

The Canadian Press has learned that the new deal would permit four Canadian charter airlines to fly between multiple locations after landing in Cuba.

That means winter sun seekers would be able to fly on Canadian air carriers to destinations within Cuba, presumably on a single vacation.

Cuban officials confirmed today that the deal would be announced next week.

Last year, a record 900,000 Canadian tourists visited Cuba, and the Castro regime is anxious to top the one-million mark this year.

The new deal comes just weeks after the United States tightened air travel restrictions on Cuba and 13 other countries, branding them terrorist threats following last month's incident with a bomber who threatened to blow up an airliner bound for Detroit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9886507987976074}",neutral,0.9886507987976074,0
