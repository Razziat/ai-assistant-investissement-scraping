What's an A380 worth? - The Economist,"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC8wOC8xMy93aGF0cy1hbi1hMzgwLXdvcnRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"H OW MUCH is an airliner worth if it is languishing on the tarmac, and may never fly passengers again? In the age of covid-19 that is the fate of many double-decker A 380 superjumbos built by Airbus, Europe’s aerospace giant. Once seen by airlines as the future of commercial aviation, many are being retired early as covid-19 has cast a pall on the future of globe-trotting. Those still in service could be yours for a few million dollars.

The A 380 was in trouble before the pandemic. Delays meant that by the time it at last flew it had to compete with smaller, more efficient jets. Only 14 airlines ever ordered the 500-plus seater, with Emirates, based in Dubai, operating nearly half the 242 planes delivered. After Emirates cancelled orders for 39 in February 2019, Airbus announced it was winding down production of the plane.

All aircraft have lost value as a result of covid-19. But the fall has been unusually steep for A 380s. The model’s main attraction for airlines was to relieve congested runways at global hub airports. Now these are empty. Fewer than one in ten working A 380s are plying the skies, according to Flightradar24, which tracks air traffic. Smaller craft are faring somewhat better.

The aviation industry may not recover until 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade group. That is a long time to maintain aeroplanes, so some airlines have thrown in the towel. Air France has announced its nine A 380s will never fly again, and booked a €500m ($588m) write-down in the value of its fleet. Germany’s Lufthansa has cut its 14-strong squadron by six. Singapore Airlines, the second-biggest operator with 19 planes, plans an ominous-sounding “review”.

Valuations of A 380s have tumbled accordingly. The oldest models have been flying for 12 years or so. At that age, aircraft have typically lost half their value. Given each costs $250m-300m to buy when kitted out, airline accountants might have hoped for $125m. But even before covid-19 appraisers suggested between $75m and $100m. Now some A 380s are fetching half what they used to be worth, says Usman Ahmed of Aircore Aviation, a consultancy. The slump is borne out by the accounts of investment funds that own planes and lease them to airlines. A fund called Doric Nimrod Air One recently cut the accounting value of its sole asset, an A 380 leased to Emirates, by 51% in dollar terms.

The share prices of listed A 380-owning funds suggests the residual values of the planes once the leases expire are between $10m and $15m, says Matthew Hose of Jefferies, an investment bank. Given regular maintenance overhauls of each of the A 380’s four engines can cost $6m, existing motors in decent nick are, in principle, worth at least that much. Add the landing gear, also in principle reusable, and that would make the airframe itself worthless. It also signals that even the spares—which in modern planemaking are always aircraft-specific and useless for other models—may not have much value.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9772554039955139}",neutral,0.9772554039955139,0
Airbus and Boeing to issue joint paper on modernising air traffic management - Flightglobal,"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FpcmZyYW1lcnMvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctdG8taXNzdWUtam9pbnQtcGFwZXItb24tbW9kZXJuaXNpbmctYWlyLXRyYWZmaWMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC8xMzk5NTYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has collaborated with Boeing to write a report warning that air traffic management (ATM) technology must be significantly modernised to manage countless new small aircraft that will occupy future airspace.

The paper, to be released in the coming weeks, will describe how rapidly increasing numbers of drones, and possible future small air taxis, will require new ATC systems, says Mark Cousin, chief executive of Airbus’s Silicon Valley-based innovation division Acubed.

Acubed contributed to Airbus’s work on the paper, but parent Airbus led the company’s efforts.

Airbus “will be issuing a joint paper with Boeing on the future air traffic management system”, Cousin tells FlightGlobal. “It’s a cooperative effort.”

The paper will be released in “a week or two”, Cousin adds. It was distributed to ICAO in June 2020.

Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its role in the effort.

The companies are writing the report “to lay” the problem, with the goal of spurring action by regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration.

The report will describe “what direction air traffic management needs to take in the coming years in order to cope with the vastly increasing complexity of air traffic management that is going to come with the integration of new vehicles”, says Cousin.

The exponential growth of the drone industry is partly driving the effort.

The FAA’s current number of drone registrations stands at 1.7 million, up from 1 million in January 2018, according to government figures.

In addition to drones, future skies could be crowded with air taxis envisioned as part of the urban air mobility concept. Dozens of companies are now working on aspects of air-taxi development, foreseeing the small craft zipping above crowded cities, carrying several passengers on short trips.

Acubed has been working on advanced air traffic management technology via a project called Airbus UTM, short for unmanned traffic management. It has developed air traffic simulations tools, and through a company called DroneDeploy offers its Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability.

Airbus subsidiary Metron Aviation has also participated in NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility National Campaign to help develop a vision for a future air-traffic management system.

Future airspace management may need to be significantly different from today’s systems, which the FAA has been working to upgrade through a delayed, multi-year programme called NextGen.

Cousin envisions a future system in which aircraft have much more-advanced onboard technology that could largely handle traffic management. Such systems could potentially detect collision threats, with aircraft responding automatically, he says.

That type of technology could possibly allow air traffic controllers to clear aircraft to operate “in a particular area”, rather that continually directly each aircraft’s movement, says Cousin.

Story updated on 29 August to include the new, recently changed name of NASA’s campaign, and to clarify that Acubed contributed to the Airbus- and Boeing-led effort, which focuses on air traffic management.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999919056892395}",neutral,0.999919056892395,0
"Is The World Large Enough To Support Airbus, Boeing And Comac? - Aviation Week","Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi93b3JsZC1sYXJnZS1lbm91Z2gtc3VwcG9ydC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWNvbWFj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Is the world large enough to support Airbus, Boeing and Comac? Could we end up with a duopoly, without Airbus or Boeing, if China dictates that its airlines and lessors buy homegrown products?

Aviation Week Beijing Bureau Chief Bradley Perrett answers:

No major shift is likely to happen before the late 2030s or even the 2040s, because Comac is far from ready to go head-to-head with the two Western airframe companies. Predicting how the competition will play out so far ahead is highly speculative, so the best that can be done is to mention a few factors.

If Comac has a near monopoly in the local market, it will have a base production rate that will help it achieve the low costs it will need for competing elsewhere. On the other hand, a state company with a guaranteed local market does not have a lot of incentive to work hard at making money abroad. The Chinese Communist Party can address that to some extent.

China could simply subsidize its way into the market if its airliners are reasonably competitive. (Real duds can’t be given away.) This raises questions about how the U.S. and Airbus partner countries would react to such subsidies. Would they retaliate by barring Comac from their markets? That would depend on what trade agreements are in place in future decades. But China’s international relations are declining so fast that we must wonder whether it will have access to Western civil aeronautics technology in 20 years. Curtailment of Western supply, especially for engines, would set back the Chinese commercial aircraft effort many years.

Why would it take until the late 2030s or later for China to knock Airbus or Boeing into the third spot? Even if the Comac C919 proves to be about as efficient in operation as the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX—as it should be, on paper—the program is probably running at least 6-7 years behind the Neo and MAX. After entry into service, more years will be needed to establish a reputation for reliability and support. Production has to ramp up and cost must be gradually driven down. Even if all went well from now on, by the time the C919 began to make progress in the international market, either or both of the Western manufacturers should be close to a next round of product renewal—moving Comac’s goalposts and requiring improvement in the C919.

The Chinese-Russian Craic CR929 widebody is now due for first delivery in 2028-29, so it faces much the same problem.

By the 2040s, propulsion technology may have changed. Aircraft and engines may be much more integrated. Comac could be back to square one. Yet, Airbus and Boeing could be too, and they would not have Chinese taxpayers’ money to spend on unusually challenging development programs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998286962509155}",neutral,0.9998286962509155,0

Airbus unveils B-model Lakota helos to enter US Army fleet next year - Defense News,"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sYW5kLzIwMjAvMDgvMjgvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtYi1tb2RlbC1sYWtvdGFzLXdpbGwtZW50ZXItdXMtYXJteS1mbGVldC1pbi0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The newest version of the UH-72B Lakota light utility helicopter will enter the U.S. Army fleet in 2021, aircraft manufacturer Airbus announced Aug. 28 at the National Guard Association of the United States virtual trade show.

Beginning with the newest orders placed in 2020, Airbus will deliver 17 UH-72Bs next year after supplying 460 UH-72As across the Army, Navy and National Guard. In September, the last UH-72A (the 463rd) will roll off the production line in Columbus, Mississippi, according to the statement.

The “B” model will look distinctly different from the “A” variant. The aircraft is based off the Airbus H145 and will feature a Fenestron tail rotor, which the current A model does not have, according to Airbus. The B model will also have more powerful engine technology, “enhanced” controls and the Airbus Helionix avionics suite, the company said.

The new helicopter variant will go to the Army National Guard.

“Since we first began operations with the UH-72 Lakota some 15 years ago, this helicopter has been the workhorse of the Army and National Guard, saving lives, assisting in disaster relief, training thousands of pilots, and, more importantly, helping to protect our communities and our country,” Col. Calvin Lane, the Army’s project manager for utility helicopters, said in the statement. “Procuring the UH-72B Lakota provides tremendous value with no research and development costs for the Army.”

Since the program’s inception in 2006, the Army and National Guard have logged nearly 800,000 flight hours, serving as the initial entry rotary-wing training aircraft for the Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and has flown search and rescue, medical evacuation and disaster relief missions as well counter-drug operations at the Southwest border.

The Army chose to make the Lakota the primary training helicopter and retire its TH-67 aircraft when it restructured its entire aviation fleet in 2013. The decision met some resistance. Several companies like Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland were hoping at the time to sell military training helicopters to several armed services, including the Army.

AgustaWestland, a Leonardo subsidiary, filed a lawsuit four years ago in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims over the Army’s plan to buy 16 of the aircraft for the training fleet. The court ruled in favor of AgustaWestland, and the Army was barred from buying the Lakotas. But the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s decision in early 2018, allowing the service to move forward in procuring Lakotas.

The current Army acquisition objective for the Lakota is 478 aircraft, according to the Army’s fiscal 2021 budget request.

Partnership with Airbus Subsidiary Opening New Doors for Worldwide Business Students - ERAU News,"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5lcmF1LmVkdS9oZWFkbGluZXMvcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtc3Vic2lkaWFyeS1vcGVuaW5nLW5ldy1kb29ycy1mb3Itd29ybGR3aWRlLWJ1c2luZXNzLXN0dWRlbnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A recent partnership forged between Embry-Riddle Worldwide’s College of Business and the Airbus subsidiary Skytra will enable the school to develop a strong niche in the key area of financial risk management while allowing students to learn skills that will be in constant demand in a range of industries around the globe.

“There are not many schools that specialize in this area,” said Dr. Maneesh Sharma, Dean of Worldwide’s College of Business. “Financial risk management is a unique, STEM-based discipline that is crucial not only for the aviation industry, but for nearly any field, which will give students a skill that is transferable.”

Skytra was created by Airbus in 2019 to help manage revenue streams in an industry that can be volatile, and that goal has become even more crucial since the pandemic began earlier this year.

The partnership with Embry-Riddle has its roots in financial risk management courses Dr. Sharma and a colleague had designed for the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which ultimately connected him with Skytra.

Dr. Sharma then teamed up with Embry-Riddle professors Sunder Raghavan, Alfonso Canella, and Ron Mau on a project designed to authenticate the value of Skytra’s product offerings.

Their research showed that one of Skytra’s tools, the Trans-Atlantic (TA) index, offered revenue protection close to 90%, even after the pandemic collapsed yields.

This groundbreaking ability to hedge revenue has profound implications for the aviation industry and other fields, particularly tourism, which extends to lodging, leisure and theme parks.

The partnership also will help enhance Embry-Riddle’s longstanding reputation as an innovator and thought leader when it comes to business innovation.

“The focus on risk management distinguishes us from other business schools, and also elevates the overall Embry-Riddle brand in business education,” Dr. Sharma said.

As Skytra’s preferred academic partner, Embry-Riddle will continue conducting research in areas that hold the potential to transform the travel industry, including revenue hedging, building a price lock market for businesses and individuals, and offering better revenue protection for the entire tourism industry.

For students in Worldwide’s College of Business, Dr. Sharma says the value of the new partnership is clear.

“If they come to Embry-Riddle and are willing to learn, they can build knowledge in an area that will ensure they stand out in a competitive job market,” he said. “Financial risk management is a discipline that few have expertise in, but it’s important in nearly every industry.”

Yahsat signs contract with Airbus to build Thuraya's next generation system - Airbus,"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wOC15YWhzYXQtc2lnbnMtY29udHJhY3Qtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtdG8tYnVpbGQtdGh1cmF5YXMtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Abu Dhabi / Toulouse, Aug 27, 2020 – Airbus has been selected by Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat), the UAE’s leading global satellite operator, to build Thuraya 4-NGS, the next generation mobile telecommunications system that will drive the continued advancement of Thuraya’s L-band business. Thuraya 4-NGS will deliver higher capabilities and flexibility while increasing capacity and coverage across Europe, Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, enabling next generation mobility solutions for all customer segments, including defense, government and enterprise.

This is a major milestone in Yahsat’s commitment towards transforming Thuraya and rolling out its next-generation system, which entails a complete overhaul of its space and ground platforms, enabling a new set of services, products and solutions, across a greater coverage area. The new capabilities will drive leadership across many strategic product lines, such as maritime, IoT, and data solutions offering a wide spectrum of throughput capabilities and the highest speeds available in the market, while reinforcing Thuraya’s leading position in the MSS voice market.

Thuraya’s next generation system will provide a world of opportunities to customers, service partners, hardware manufacturers and integrators, enhancing user experience across land, sea and air to support multiple customer segments, including government, consumer and enterprise.

Furthermore, an advanced portfolio of solutions to support government and defense users will accelerate Thuraya’s leadership in this market, both within the UAE, regionally and globally. Meanwhile, all existing products and services will continue to be supported by Thuraya’s space and ground segments, enabling service continuity during and after the transformation programme.

This latest commitment from Yahsat takes its total committed investment to date to well over US$500 million, and more is anticipated in the coming years, including an option with Airbus to build Thuraya 5-NGS (an additional satellite identical to Thuraya 4-NGS), strengthening its coverage and capabilities across the Asia Pacific region.

Khaled Al Qubaisi, Chairman of Yahsat’s Board of Directors and CEO of Mubadala’s Aerospace, Renewables & ICT platform stated, “This commitment by Mubadala and the Government of Abu Dhabi underscores Yahsat’s position as a market leader, pioneer and disruptor. Moreover, it is another key step in reinforcing the UAE as a front-runner in the global space and satellite industry, laying the foundations for sustainable growth and development in the sector for years to come.”

Ali Al Hashemi, CEO of Thuraya and General Manager of Yahsat Government Solutions (YGS) continued, “Thuraya 4-NGS represents a significant evolution of our L-band capabilities, enabling a wider range of interoperable FSS/MSS solutions for Thuraya and YGS customers. This will be critical in delivering superior defense solutions, such as battlefield communications, to our government users, while offering a complete MSS portfolio to all of our current and future customers and partners to drive the next phase of innovation and growth.”

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems said, “Building on a relationship with Yahsat that dates back more than 10 years, our selection is testament to the innovation and engineering excellence of Airbus’ geostationary satellites. Thuraya 4-NGS, as well as being electric, will also benefit from our latest processed payload technology giving increased flexibility and adaptability over the course of its life in orbit. Yahsat’s new project reinforces Airbus Defence and Space’s position as the world’s number one in electric propulsion satellites.”

Based on the state-of-the-art all-electric Airbus Eurostar Neo Platform, Thuraya 4-NGS will incorporate a large 12-metre L-band antenna and a payload with on-board processing providing advanced routing flexibility of up to 3200 channels with dynamic power allocation over a large number of spot beams. It is scheduled for operation in 2024.

Airbus' output of widebody jets cut as pandemic slashes revenue | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjAvYXVnLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1vdXRwdXQtb2Ytd2lkZWJvZHktamV0cy1jdXQtYXMtcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus cut back wide-body jet production after it burned through $5.2 billion in the second quarter, retrenching further to safeguard cash while it waits out a collapse in demand.

The world's biggest plane-maker will now aim to produce five A350 aircraft a month rather than the six targeted in April, it said in a statement late last week. The company booked a little over $1 billion of coronavirus-related charges against earnings and said a future restructuring provision could total $1.9 billion.

Airbus delivered 74 planes in the quarter, when global fleets were largely grounded, less than one-third of the year-ago tally. With travel set to remain below 2019's levels for several years, the company nonetheless said it aimed to stanch cash outflows in the second half of the year.

""We believe it's going to be a long and slow recovery,"" CEO Guillaume Faury said on a conference call. ""We're trying to take a balanced view on this and not be too pessimistic.""

Air travel is reeling from its biggest ever slump after the pandemic brought decades of growth to a shuddering halt. That's left Faury walking a tightrope as he seeks to cram down costs without doing permanent damage to the system of suppliers and skilled workers on which Airbus will rely when better times return. Prospects for a quick rebound are meanwhile receding as new flare-ups of the virus lead to the reimposition of curbs on flights.

It's tough right now to know what the market will look like by the end of this year and even by the middle of 2021, Faury said. Single-aisle plane production could ramp up again in 2022, though air traffic is unlikely to recover fully until some time between 2023 and 2025, he said.

Jefferies International analyst Sandy Morris said Airbus is making a reasonable effort to balance support for its customers, supply chain and employees with generating an acceptable performance for shareholders. One positive sign was a smaller-than-expected buildup in inventory, he said in a note to clients.

Faury said discussions with customers are ""difficult"" as the manufacturer pushes airlines to take planes. In some cases, Airbus is demanding cash compensation from carriers that aren't able to accept deliveries.

Cash burn for the quarter matched the level for the first three months, excluding a one-off payment to settle bribery claims, as the virus prevented delivery of 145 aircraft. Faury said the ambition now is to be cash-neutral in the second half, before customer financing and any spending on acquisitions.

Revenue plunged almost 40%, with the decline exacerbated by a three-week shutdown of assembly lines as the company took steps to guard against the virus and assessed the situation.

The update comes after rival Boeing announced a raft of new measures last week to preserve cash and adapt to the shrunken market. The U.S. company delayed the debut of its new 777X model, cut build rates for existing planes, said it will end production of the 747 jumbo, and mooted the shutdown of one of two plants that build the 787 Dreamliner. Job cuts might be stepped up.

Airbus' ratcheting down of wide-body rates reflects scarce demand for aircraft used in long-haul services. The European plane-maker left its other production unchanged, after slashing output to 40 planes a month for its popular A320 family in April. At the time, A350 rates were trimmed by about 40% to six per month, while the slower-selling A330 was cut back to two a month.

A Canadian assembly line that builds the A220, a smaller model acquired from Bombardier, will progressively return to its pre-virus rate of four planes per month, Airbus said.

The company is embarking on the biggest restructuring in its history with plans to cut 15,000 jobs in the commercial aerospace division. Faury has meanwhile extended credit lines and clamped down on expenses to give access to 30 billion euros to manage the pandemic.

Airbus said the U.K. Serious Fraud Office has requisitioned its GPT Special Project Management arm, which operated in Saudi Arabia and was closed in April, to appear in court over a corruption-related charge.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9429721832275391}",negative,0.9429721832275391,-1

Airbus Interior Services to support generic Ka IFC retrofits on A320s - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMDgvYWlyYnVzLWludGVyaW9yLXNlcnZpY2VzLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtZ2VuZXJpYy1rYS1pZmMtcmV0cm9maXRzLW9uLWEzMjBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In what could be seen as a surprising win for a company that self-identifies as a “development stage service provider of inflight entertainment and connectivity solutions”, US firm Aerkomm Inc. has forged an agreement with Airbus Interior Services (AIS), enabling its Ka-band IFC offering to be retrofitted to A320 family aircraft to facilitate onboard Internet for passengers. AIS CEO Joël Frugier tells Runway Girl Network that the Aerkomm K++-branded system is a generic Ka satcom solution, and not affiliated with the Inmarsat Global Xpress ecosystem.

Under the new pact, AIS will develop, install and certify Aerkomm K++ on an A320 test aircraft, to EASA and FAA certification standards. “Service Bulletins (SBs) and kits will be provided by AIS, applying Airbus expertise for A320 family customers. The agreement also includes Airbus support for the integration on aircraft, such as, but not limited to, the ARINC 791 structural reinforcements and engineering works,” says Airbus in a statement.

“The Airbus Interiors Services Service Bulletin and Airbus kits for the Aerkomm K++ retrofit solution will be installed first on Hong Kong Airlines’ fleet of 12 Airbus A320 aircraft,” adds the airframer.

A five-year-old understanding with Hong Kong Airlines?

Aerkomm’s principal operating subsidiary is Fremont, California-based Aircom Pacific, Inc. Its management team includes COO Georges Caldironi, a 25-year veteran of Airbus. “We are pleased that Hong Kong Airlines will be our first customer benefitting from this Airbus retrofit solution on their A320 fleet,” says Aerkomm CEO Louis Giordimaina in a statement.

Panasonic and Thales each count Hong Kong Airlines as a customer for widebody IFC. An early batch of A350s, originally destined for Azul, carry Panasonic’s Ku-band solution, while later deliveries feature Thales Ka (assumed to be Inmarsat GX service, as IFE and connectivity is coupled up on the A350). The arrangement with Aerkomm would bring another IFC provider into the mix at Hong Kong Airlines.

Runway Girl Network followed up with Airbus, inquiring specifically about whether the Aerkomm Ka-band system is intended to communicate with Inmarsat Global Xpress (GX) or if it would be a more generic Ka solution, able to communicate with various Ka providers outside of the GX ecosystem.

Joël Frugier, CEO at Airbus Interiors Services, explains: “The Aerkomm solution is from an independent system provider, with no connection to the Inmarsat GX ecosystem. It’s a generic Ka-based solution. Airbus Interiors Services engineers and obtains certification for the integration of that solution on the whole Airbus A320 family.”

Inmarsat GX connectivity – supported by Honeywell JetWave hardware and multiple value added resellers – has been linefit offerable across Airbus’ commercial aircraft portfolio for years. Lufthansa is among GX’s premier customers. While Viasat’s Ka-band IFC hardware is not yet linefit offerable at Airbus, it has been retrofitted to Airbus aircraft by a number of airlines, including Finnair and SAS.

While the Aerkomm arrangement with AIS covers retrofits only, it shows a willingness on the part of Airbus to facilitate other Ka IFC solutions, and lend its expertise to the installs.

Cracking into inflight entertainment and connectivity

A read of Aerkomm’s corporate web site – and that of its subsidiary Aircom Pacific – indicates that the company has been promising to deliver inflight entertainment and connectivity to industry for years. In a June 2015 announcement, it announced it would provide a dual Ku/Ka-band IFC system to Hong Kong Airlines.

For its part, Airbus first agreed to work with Aerkomm on the Ka-band IFC system for ACJs and “commercial” aircraft in 2018, according to an Aerkomm statement dated 29 May 2018. Aerkomm announced a firm agreement with Airbus in December of that year.

Given the volume of Aerkomm announcements, Airbus’ formal statement about the partnership to bring the Aerkomm K++ system to Hong Kong Airlines’ A320s is notable.

Exploration with Telesat

The Aerkomm K++-branded system is billed as being compatible with the “next-generation of satellites”. Those satellites could include Telesat’s forthcoming Telesat LEO constellation, as Aerkomm’s Aircom Pacific subsidiary in June inked a cooperation agreement with Telesat “to assess the technical and commercial viability of incorporating the Telesat LEO network capacity into Aircom’s portfolio and network”. The cooperation agreement is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement.

In a recent interview with Telesat director, product and commercial (global) Manik Vinnakota, RGN sought color about the arrangement. Vinnakota says Aircom Pacific is “creating a new integrated terminal” and wants to make sure it is compatible with both GEO and LEO satellites. “And once they get onto the aircraft, what’s the retrofit required to make it as frictionless and minimal as possible?” So it is in this context that they are working together, he says.

The Telesat executive adds that Aircom Pacific is thinking about how IFC should be monetized, and “advertising, etc”.

“We have become part of the Seamless Air Alliance since we last spoke and these are the questions we’re trying to answer to make sure the passengers get connected,” he says. Airbus is a founding member of Seamless, which wants to see industry pursue a modular platform architecture for IFC.

"Autonomous Airbus aces autopilot taxi, takeoff and landing tests - New Atlas","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy1hdHRvbC1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWFpcmxpbmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Autopilot has been around longer than you think. Indeed, in 1914, just 11 years after the Wright Brothers first ushered humanity into the aviation age, a fellow named Lawrence Sperry built a gyroscopic self-stabilization system into a Curtiss C-2. It was capable, he claimed, of keeping an aircraft straight and level and pointed in a consistent direction on the compass, and he put on a spectacular public demonstration at the Seine just outside Paris to prove it.

First, he did a pass by the crowd with his hands clearly up in the air. Then, he did the same with an assistant standing on one of the wings, moving about to throw the weight balance off. Then he made a third pass where both pilot and passenger went out and stood on the wings. The crowd went bananas. Those magnificent men and their flying machines!

But Sperry was not satisfied. Through World War 1, he worked on a number of designs for a fully self-flying aircraft, including the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Aircraft and the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb, which is regarded by some as an early precursor of today's cruise missiles. These were never fully successful, and the relevant Wikipedia page makes for some entertaining reading with phrases like ""When last seen, the N-9 was cruising over Bayshore Air Station at about 4,000 feet (1,200 m), heading east. It was never seen again.""

Sperry invented the artificial horizon, which graces cockpits in modified forms to this day, and the Sperry autopilot (now a product arm of Lockheed Martin), or something very similar, is now ""standard equipment on virtually every aircraft to hold the plane on a desired flight path.""

Indeed, the autopilot system is now flying your typical commercial airliner far more than the human pilots, sharp and starched though their jackets may be. These magnificent men and women now chiefly handle only the up-diddly-up-up and down-diddly-down-down phases of flight: taxiing, takeoffs and landings.

This is not because the pilots want to do less; they didn't get into this line of work to put their feet up on the console and let a machine do the work. At present, the pilot is required to keep their hands on the ""stick"" until the plane reaches at least 10,000 feet, but the fact is that as weather conditions, wind and visibility deteriorate, the autopilot just does a better and safer job. Indeed, many autopilot systems are already landing aircraft automatically too, although these systems, says Airbus, are ""reliant on external infrastructure like Instrument Landing System (ILS) or GPS signals,"" and, like stable-flight autopilot, they're not autonomous, requiring human programming and supervision.

So for the last several years, Airbus has been working on what it calls the Autonomous Taxi, Take-off and Landing (ATTOL) project, which aims to bring all these functions under the control of fully autonomous systems, entirely built into the aircraft. The International Air Transport Association projects air traffic to double by 2037, and it foresees a manpower crunch as some 37,000 new aircraft are built and half a million additional pilots need to come on board.

A fully autonomous system would be a huge step, says Airbus, to ""help pilots focus less on aircraft operations and more on strategic decision-making and mission management.""

The ATTOL system relies heavily on computer vision and machine learning, and uses a raft of cameras, as well as radar and LiDAR, to build awareness of its situation. The system was fitted to a full-sized Airbus A350-1000 airliner, capable of seating more than 400 passengers, which ran some 450-odd fully human-controlled flights to gather video data and fine-tune control algorithms, before being sent out to handle business by itself.

In January this year, ATTOL performed the first fully-automated vision-based take-off at Toulouse-Blagnac airport. The video would be terribly boring if it wasn't for the palpable stress of the pilot, with his hand hovering over the stick. It's a feeling you'll relate to if you've ever engaged Autopilot on a Tesla for the first time.

ATTOL: Autonomous Taxiing, Take-Off and Landing test flight

And at the end of June, Airbus announced that the project is now complete, with the ATTOL system having completed six fully autonomous operations, each including five take-offs and landings plus plenty of taxiing around the airport in between. It's a successful conclusion to the ATTOL program, and while it doesn't result in a commercial product, Airbus says it will continue research into the application of autonomous technologies going forward.

So in many ways, we've come a long way since aviation's golden age of invention in the nineteen-teens, but it seems there's still going to be room behind the stick for human pilots for some time yet.

"Airbus, Operators Study On-Aircraft Fume Anomalies - Aviation Week","Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vc2FmZXR5LW9wcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1vcGVyYXRvcnMtc3R1ZHktYWlyY3JhZnQtZnVtZS1hbm9tYWxpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has launched a formal program to study onboard fume incidents and is developing an upgrade for the Airbus A320 environmental control system. A UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch report told of an in-service incident that left a British Airways Airbus A320ceo first officer incapacitated following a nerve-jangling approach and landing at London Heathrow Airport.

The September 2019 incident flight originated on a rainy morning in Zurich. The crew noticed a slight odor shortly after departure, but it soon went away, and the crew opted to continue to London, an Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) final report said. As the crew passed through 4,000 ft. on its approach into London, both pilots reported a sudden, strong fume odor, the report said. Both pilots donned their oxygen masks, and the captain made a “Pan-Pan” international urgency call to Heathrow tower controllers, who told two aircraft ahead of the British Airways A320 and one trailing it to go around to give the stricken aircraft priority and a margin for error.

The A320 landed and moved to a nearby taxiway, where it was met by emergency services. The co-pilot removed his mask to see if the fumes were still present. He stated that they were, and immediately began to feel nauseated. He then went to the lavatory while the captain requested air stairs to expedite getting medical personnel onboard.

Investigators learned that the odor was limited to the cockpit—one of three separate environmental control system (ECS) climate-control zones on the A320. Nothing unusual was detected in the forward or aft cabin areas, the other two zones.

Investigators could not determine what caused the fumes. Prompted in part by British Airways’ report of hundreds of fume or odor events in their A320 fleet over the previous year, the AAIB took a deeper look at the issue, and at five incidents in particular that happened in late 2019, including one nonrevenue flight. All involved Airbus A320-family aircraft.

The AAIB did not find definitive causes for any of the incidents. It did, however, observe some common factors. Among them: The incidents usually involved aircraft that stayed overnight in damp or rainy weather and started with a faint smell shortly after departure. In each case, conditions worsened rapidly during descent, and odors were described using similar terms, including “sweaty socks, manure and farmyard smells, which were unpleasant and distinctive,” the AAIB said.

In most cases, the cabin crew did not report any issues. On the few flights where cabin occupants detected fumes, they were most prevalent in the galleys.

Analysis of flight data recorder data found no correlation between engine or systems settings and the presence of fumes. The auxiliary power unit is not considered a likely culprit, as it was often not in use during the events. Off-aircraft factors, such as application of cleaning or anti-ice fluids before departure, were ruled out. The most effective mitigation strategies included using “the smoke and fumes abnormal and emergency procedures,” the AAIB said.

While few definitive conclusions can be drawn, the AAIB has some theories. “The evidence indicates that it is likely that these fumes are derivatives of contaminants entering the ECS,” the agency said. “It may not be a single compound but a combination of compounds which react and then become airborne in the bleed air supplies passing through the ECS. The fumes may have similar traits to hydrocarbon compounds combined with water vapor in low concentration which are liberated as water vapor condenses when it enters cooler conditions, for example as it passes into the flight deck or cabin via ducts.”

Beyond analyzing data and comparing witness observations, operators, investigators and Airbus have largely been frustrated in their efforts to understand the problem. No sample of the fumes has been captured, and nobody has been able to recreate the scenario on the ground.

“The unpredictable nature of the events has also meant that it has not been possible to construct an experimental flight-test schedule to capture more data,” the AAIB said. “This has left the manufacturer reliant on reported data, making the issue difficult to resolve in practical terms.”

Airbus plans to use Project Fresh to centralize analysis of related incidents. It also plans to roll out “an enhanced ECS filtration system” that will include a retrofit option, and it has published an “information paper” that provides “all the known aspects of fumes and smoke events,” the AAIB said.

British Airways has put a post-fumes maintenance procedure in place and will consider installing the new Airbus ECS system when it is available.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998069405555725}",neutral,0.9998069405555725,0
Airbus delivers first of 16 advanced law enforcement H125 helicopters to U.S. Customs and Border Protection - Airbus,"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wOC1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3Qtb2YtMTYtYWR2YW5jZWQtbGF3LWVuZm9yY2VtZW50LWgxMjXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Columbus, Miss., August 19, 2020 – Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (AHI) has delivered the first of 16 new H125 helicopters uniquely configured for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO). AMO collaborated with AHI as part of a long-term fleet upgrade initiative, and the resulting configuration has led to one of the most advanced, high-tech law enforcement helicopters ever developed.

“Our mission is to safeguard the nation by anticipating and confronting security threats,” said Steve Boyer, Deputy Executive Assistant Commissioner for AMO. “Airbus Helicopters’ continued commitment to designing, manufacturing, and delivering quality products will enable AMO personnel to successfully and safely carry out this mission.”



The first helicopter for the new configuration was tested and delivered from Airbus Helicopters, Inc.’s facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. The remaining aircraft are being built in Columbus, Miss, where a workforce made up of 40 percent U.S. veterans also produces the UH-72A Lakota for the U.S. Army and has delivered more than 450 single-engine H125 aircraft for the North American market.



Following a rigorous analysis of its mission needs and next generation aerospace technology, AMO developed a set of requirements for the new helicopters, which Airbus put in place through nearly 30 Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs). The series of STCs are tied together through a primary all-encompassing STC that ensures all of the systems interact properly with one another and with the basic aircraft.



Airbus and AMO have a longstanding relationship of more than 30 years, during which Airbus has delivered more than 100 helicopters from the H120 and H125 family. This new acquisition was made possible through a partnership with Davenport Aviation, an SBA-certified woman-owned small business and HUBZone contractor specializing in the supply of aerospace equipment to federal, state and local government agencies.



“We are honored to partner with Airbus Helicopters and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to support this fleet upgrade for enhanced law enforcement capabilities through the procurement of 16 new H125 helicopters from our GSA contract,” said Leah Simoes, Owner and Chairwoman of Davenport Aviation. “Throughout this project, we have been very appreciative of the support we have received from Airbus and CBP of our WOSB, HUBZone Certified small business.”



Known for its power, versatility and excellent performance in hot and high conditions, the H125 features dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, a crash resistant fuel system, and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays. The H125 is the single most popular law enforcement helicopter in the U.S., accounting for nearly half of all helicopters delivered for that mission in North America over the last decade.

Airbus Develops COVID-19 Era MRO Offerings - Aviation Week,"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3BzLWNvdmlkLTE5LWVyYS1tcm8tb2ZmZXJpbmdz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has released a variety of new offerings aimed toward helping airline and MRO customers during the novel coronavirus pandemic. The solutions include a new app and capabilities for its Skywise data platform, a distance learning solution for maintenance courses and a medevac conversion for passenger aircraft catered toward transport of COVID-19 patients.

With so much of the world’s fleet grounded during the pandemic, the OEM has released a new geospatial app for Skywise to help airlines more easily decide where to store each individual aircraft, and in which order. Airlines can use the app to tag their grounded aircraft and virtually park them into various locations at airports and stations, such as in hangars, at gates and on taxiways. The app can be used to rapidly extract contextual data, such as an aircraft’s age, its latest and next maintenance checks, and last major assembly overhaul.

According to Airbus, the geospatial app simplifies tracking down and knowing which aircraft are stored in which location, as well as which maintenance tasks need to be carried out to uphold airworthiness. It also says the app will prove useful for airlines once passenger demand returns, since it can help airlines solve the challenges of identifying the optimal aircraft to bring back into service and which maintenance tasks need to be performed.

Airbus has also deployed additional capabilities for its Skywise Reliability offering for automating reliability reporting, called Skywise Reliability Premium. According to Airbus, Premium enables airlines to identify and prioritize technical issues across their fleets to save time by providing the “right first time solution” and enabling easy assessment of its effectiveness. In the pandemic environment, Airbus says Premium will help airlines reduce engineering analysis time “from three weeks to three clicks” by implementing the correct service bulletins during aircraft downtime, focusing on issues with the biggest cost impact, identifying their root cause and enabling airlines to take relevant maintenance action.

On the training side, Airbus Training Services has set up and obtained EASA approval for a synchronous distance learning solution for maintenance courses. Airbus says the solution was developed to provide opportunity to customers in the wake of travel restrictions by enabling them to perform theoretical maintenance training locally. Led by a remote Airbus instructor in real-time and supervised by a local Airbus exam proctor, customers will be able to participate in local examination sessions—where Airbus stations are available—for theoretical certifying maintenance courses and non-certifying courses. Airbus says that once travel restrictions are lifted and whenever practical training is required, the training effort will be limited to organizing these practical sessions.

Lastly, Airbus has developed a solution for quickly converting passenger aircraft into medevac configuration for customers looking to transport COVID-19 patients. Developed over six weeks’ time by a multi-functional team from Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft, Helicopters, and Defence and Space units, the solutions are based on the A330 and A340 platforms to carry intensive care patients over long-range distances. Airbus was supported by the French Direction Générale de la Santé (part of the French Ministry of Health), which provided all the medical specifications associated with COVID-19 patients in intensive and low care. According to Airbus, the concept has been fine-tuned and it can now offer customers wishing to perform medevac operations a “mature solution.”

The OEM’s A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), derived from the commercial A330 platform, was already being used by the French Air Force to provide medevac transport for COVID-19 patients since March 18. Airbus says the A330 MRTT is well-suited for medevac operations, with the capacity to carry up to 130 NATO stretchers. In its “light medevac” configuration, medical beds can be installed above designated fold-down seats and stowed in the lower cargo compartments during troop transport. Its “intensive medevac” configuration, in which critical care modules are installed to replicate an intensive care unit in the air, is the format being used to transport COVID-19 patients.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9942903518676758}",neutral,0.9942903518676758,0
Actual Airbus Pilot Reviews Microsoft Flight Simulator's Accuracy - Tom's Hardware,"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hY3R1YWwtcGlsb3QtcmV2aWV3cy1taWNyb3NvZnQtZmxpZ2h0LXNpbXVsYXRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’re not familiar with YouTuber 320 Sim Pilot, he’s a real-world Airbus pilot who for the past four months has been making in-depth flight sim videos on a regular, almost daily basis. Most of these have been in the 2016 flight simulator X-Plane 11, but with Microsoft Flight Simulator now out to the public, his past few videos have been focused on how well the game recreates the Airbus A320.



Half review and half guided tour of how flying the Airbus A320 works, his first video in this series is a 26 minute comparison between Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane 11’s respective renditions of this aircraft. The key metric here is, of course, how true-to-life each game’s take is.

So far in Microsoft Flight Simulator, I’ve only toyed around with small propeller planes and have largely stuck to controlling them with my cheap Logitech HOTAS, but Sim Flight 360 shows how granular the game’s controls can get if you want them to. Instead of relying on a controller, he largely tools around with the game’s rendered cockpit controls, moving his plane mostly through the autopilot's knobs and rendered in-cockpit displays rather than through manually adjusting a flight stick.

The result is an impressive showcase of both the real-world steps pilots go through when flying an Airbus, and the depths Microsoft’s team has taken in recreating that process. Aside from a few minor simplifications in what shows up on the in-cockpit displays, 320 Sim Pilot gets about halfway through his video before he encounters any unrealistic control.



This happens when the game reads him turning his heading knob too far to the left as a sign that he wants to go right, which is not how an actual Airbus operates. “The real airplane, as long as you start turning it in the right direction, it will keep following the heading button in that direction,” 320 Sim Pilot explains. ""It's quite clever.""



He encounters a few more minor issues throughout his flight, but leaves fairly impressed, especially given that this content is free with Microsoft Flight Simulator, whereas he had to pay to add the Airbus A320 to X-Plane 11. “They’ve obviously spent some time sat in the actual aircraft.”

His approval extends to the look of the plane as well, as he starts out his video commending both the in-cockpit graphics and explaining exterior plane features I didn't realize were even in the game.



With that level of detail, then, 320 Sim Pilot's video is also a fun way to shadow a real pilot as he works us through his job. For instance, while I have most of the game's assistance options turned on, 320 Sim Pilot walks us through full takeoff and landing checklists, including plugging his destination into Microsoft Flight Simulator’s rendered in-cockpit computer. I didn’t even realize that you could actually type on those things in this game. I wonder if anyone has bothered to screenshot themselves typing in 80085 yet?

So far, I’ve been proud of myself just for looking up how a Cessna altimeter works so I could more accurately read the one in game, so this process is fascinating to me. It’s probably the closest that I’ll ever get to being inside an actual commercial cockpit mid-flight, and I’m glad Microsoft has put enough detail into Flight Simulator to make this possible.



Since releasing his impressions video, 320 Sim Pilot has since released four more videos, which you can see on his channel, each helping tutorialize how he flies so you can try it out for yourself. While the disclaimer at the start of his videos warn that they are for “home entertainment use only,” they’re a great way to nurture an interest in flying.

Following the recent ‘first metal cut’, production of the first Rear Centre Tank (RCT) for the new long range A321XLR is now underway. The RCT, which is unique to this variant, is a permanently installed high-capacity fuel tank which makes maximum volumetric use of the aircraft's lower fuselage. The RCT structure which is integrated in fuselage Sections 15 and 17 is located behind the main landing gear bay and holds up to 12,900 litres – which is more fuel than several optional Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs) combined could hold previously in the A321 Family. Moreover, since the RCT takes up less space in the cargo hold, it frees-up underfloor volume for additional cargo and baggage on long range routes of up to an unprecedented 4,700nm. Premium AEROTEC, which was commissioned by Airbus in September 2019 to manufacture the RCT, is currently completing the structure's sub-assembly at its factory in Augsburg, Germany. This phase involves production of the other RCT parts, followed by structural assembly, systems equipping and testing prior to delivery to Airbus' major component assembly (MCA) facility in Hamburg early next year, where the tank will be integrated into the aircraft's rear fuselage. The A321XLR, the next evolutionary step in Airbus' single-aisle products, has been designed to maximize overall commonality with the rest of the A320neo Family, while introducing minimal changes needed to give the aircraft an Xtra Long Range with increased revenue payload and best travel experience.

BelugaXL enters into service in Getafe

The BelugaXL recently expanded its operational reach by adding Airbus’ facility in Getafe, Spain to its network. This aircraft “no.2” – the second to fly – is working alongside the five A300-600-based BelugaST predecessors. Today the new aircraft operates several flights per week, transporting all Airbus family horizontal tailplanes and A350 XWB Section 19 (manufactured in Getafe) and A350 XWB wing lower covers (manufactured in Illescas) from Getafe to other Airbus sites in Toulouse, Hamburg and Broughton. The Getafe site itself also features a 7,200m² hangar which is dedicated to the Beluga fleet loading and unloading operations. In addition to its Getafe missions, the new transporter is also ferrying other major aircraft parts between the various Airbus sites.

The first BelugaXL flew in July 2018. This aircraft “no.1” is tasked with ongoing flight tests and evolutions. Entry-into-service of the first operational BelugaXL (aircraft “no.2”), took place from Toulouse to Broughton on 9th January this year. Aircraft “no.3” made its first flight in July this year and will enter service in Q4 2020.

By 2023 a total of six A330-based BelugaXL aircraft will be operating between the European Airbus sites. Launched in November 2014, the BelugaXL programme was awarded Type Certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in November 2019, following an intensive certification test campaign which saw it complete more than 200 flight tests, clocking over 700 flight hours.

Airbus proposes MEDEVAC conversion of passenger aircraft

A multi-functional team composed of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters has proposed a solution to quickly convert passenger aircraft into a Medical-Evacuation (“MEDEVAC”) configuration to offer to customers worldwide. The French DGS (Direction Générale de la Santé) has actively supported Airbus by providing all the medical specifications associated with Covid-19 patients in intensive care and low care. In six weeks, the team defined solutions based on A330/A340 platform which is capable of carrying COVID-19 patients in intensive care over a long-range distance. The concept has been subsequently fine-tuned and Airbus is now in a position to offer a mature solution to any customers wishing to perform MEDEVAC operations.

Airbus Flight Training’s COVID taskforce prepares the way for return to global operations

Airbus Flight Training’s dedicated COVID taskforce is proactively implementing measures to guide its customers and stakeholders through the crisis and to prepare them for the resumption of normal operations worldwide. To this end, the taskforce has recently rolled-out various measures throughout Airbus’s global training network, National Aviation Authorities and Airbus operators. As well as basic solutions (such as the provision of health & safety guidelines; maintaining a ‘ready’ core team in each training centre and providing guidance to national Authorities), Airbus Flight Training also rolled-out several strategic solutions. The latter include: further deployment of classroom instruction via video-conferencing to allow ab-initio theoretical training to continue in the flight school network; increased distance-learning in the advanced flight training phase called “Extended Flight Training Distance” (EFTD) learning; renewed recency programme which is adapted to the ‘new reality’; and the ‘Airbus Pilot Re-launch Program’ (APRP), providing several solutions for training for pilots who have been grounded for an extended period.

The EFTD learning solution, which involves virtual classroom instruction, allows the instructor to hold a class by video, with all pilots or cadets connected in an interactive video environment. EFTD complements the already existing e-learning modules covering ""system knowledge"", the initial part of the Type Rating training for the A320, A330 and A350. The virtual classroom instruction – which is designed to complement full-flight simulator training – was created and written by Airbus, and approved by the French national aviation authorities (DGAC). Meanwhile, APRP for pilots who have not flown for a few months, provides variable training scenarios to adapt to the individual, and incorporates the Competency-Based Training Assessment philosophy. It takes place over one day including both theoretical and practical (simulator) training.

EASA approves Airbus’ maintenance “Synchronous Distance Learning”

To support Airbus’ customers and offer them the opportunity to optimise this period of travel restrictions, Airbus Training Services has set up and obtained EASA-approval for a “Synchronous Distance Learning” solution for theoretical certifying maintenance courses and non-certifying courses. Customers will be able to participate to local examination sessions where Airbus stations are available – with the support of its Field Service Representatives who are trained and registered to be an “examination invigilator”. Once travel restrictions are lifted and whenever practical training is required, the training effort will be limited to organising these practical sessions. In short, this distance learning solution allows customers to perform theoretical maintenance training locally, led by a real-time remote Airbus instructor, to receive local examination sessions managed by a local Airbus invigilator.

Airbus Miami Training Center launches scholarships for A320 Type Rating Qualification and Maintenance Technician qualification

As part of its ongoing efforts to support the aerospace community during the Coronavirus pandemic, the Airbus Training Center in Miami (ATC) launched an A320 Type Rating Qualification course scholarship for student pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians in the United States. ​The initiative is part of a collaboration between the Miami ATC, OBAP (Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals), WAI (Women in Aviation International), Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Lynn University to further support the aviation industry's diversity and future needs. In total, 16 students will benefit from the scholarships. The pilot students will be qualified to fly an A320 upon successful completion of the training, and the maintenance students will have the opportunity of becoming candidates for entry-level maintenance positions with Airbus' airlines and MRO customers. The Airbus Training Center in Miami, Florida, which provides training for Airbus customers' flight and cabin crew as well as maintenance personnel, trains approximately 2,200 trainees a year.

Satair’s ‘AutoStore’ brings efficiency and space at its Hamburg facility

Airbus’ parts logistics subsidiary Satair has introduced an all-new, automated storage system, “AutoStore”, at its facility in Fuhlsbüttel, Hamburg. The new warehouse system accommodates three times as many small parts as in the past, without the need to enlarge the existing 36,000sq m logistics centre. Compared with a maximum of 100 “picks” from the shelves per hour previously, with new robots the warehouse can now handle 500 picks. Moreover, each day 10,000 orders can be dispatched – compared with 3,000 previously. The AutoStore system, developed in cooperation with the logistics service provider DB Schenker, enhances delivery quality and on-time delivery with greater flexibility while reducing overall logistics costs. At the heart of AutoStore is a three-dimensional grid, in which up to 560,000 small parts can be stored in individual ‘bins’ which are stacked in a high density layout. On the surface of this grid, 40 robots now move along the warehouse, pick the respective bins and transport the parts to an ergonomically adapted packaging station – avoiding the need for people to physically go to each of the shelves. Furthermore, routine orders can now depart Satair's AutoStore within 24 hours, urgent orders for AOGs (Aircraft on Ground) are ready for dispatch within four hours. Overall the facility’s processes are more robust, with delivery reliability being guaranteed even by unpredictable volume changes.

Skywise Parking Management app eases aircraft logistics and return to service

With Airbus’ new Skywise geospatial app, airlines can now tag their grounded aircraft, and virtually park them into airports/stations (hangar, gate, taxiway, etc.) – using the Skywise open data platform. With the app, airlines can rapidly extract contextual data such as an aircraft’s age, latest and next checks, last major assembly overhaul, and more. This allows them to efficiently decide where to store each individual aircraft, and in what order. The app was developed in the frame if the COVID‐19 circumstances which has forced airlines to ground much of their fleets. The app eases the task of tracking down and knowing which of their aircraft are stored in which location, and which maintenance tasks needs to be carried out to uphold airworthiness. Furthermore, once passenger demand returns, airlines will need to identify the optimal aircraft to bring back into service and generate a checklist of the necessary maintenance tasks – another challenge which this app makes much easier for airlines solve.

NAVBLUE launches RunwaySense to assess and report runway conditions using the aircraft as a sensor

NAVBLUE, Airbus’ dedicated flight operations subsidiary, has launched a new service called “RunwaySense”, which allows airlines and airports to accurately assess and report runway conditions by using Airbus aircraft ‘as a sensor’. Using the new system, airports can use the aircraft data to inform their runway clearing operations, which permits better timing of the runway clearing activities as well as more targeted application of de-icing chemicals. Furthermore, with the mandatory ICAO Global Reporting Format (GRF), due to come into effect in November 2021, this data contributes to airports reporting requirements with accurate, near real-time runway performance information. Airlines can also use this data to better monitor their operations as they share the data which their aircraft have generated internally, or access data generated by other operators. RunwaySense is based on BACF+ (Braking Action Computation Function), software released by NAVBLUE in 2019 on the Airbus single-aisle family. It is also the first of NAVBLUE’s airport-focussed solutions.

Airbus introduces Skywise Reliability Premium

Airbus is deploying Skywise Reliability Premium, a set of additional capabilities which supplement those of Skywise Reliability already available and offered with Skywise Core. Skywise Reliability Premium allows airlines to identify and prioritize technical issues across the fleet to save time by getting access to the right first time solution, and easily assess solution effectiveness. It also complements other solutions in Airbus’ wider fleet performance package – including Skywise Predictive Maintenance and Skywise Health Monitoring. Skywise Reliability Premium can help airlines in the current pandemic situation in particular by: reducing engineering analysis time (from three weeks to three clicks); by implementing directly the right service bulletin (SB) during aircraft downtime; by focusing on issues having the biggest cost impact; and by identifying root cause and taking relevant maintenance action.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999910593032837}",neutral,0.9999910593032837,0
"Airbus, Embraer each offer medevac conversions for aircraft - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMDgvYWlyYnVzLWVtYnJhZXItZWFjaC1vZmZlci1tZWRldmFjLWNvbnZlcnNpb25zLWZvci1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Embraer Executive Jets have each separately unveiled their own air ambulance conversion kits, enabling operators to transform passenger aircraft to carry COVID-19 patients in intensive care.

A multi-functional team comprising Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters proposed the Airbus medical evacuation (medevac) solution, which is based on the A330/A340 platform.

In a statement, Airbus says the French DGS (Direction Générale de la Santé) actively supported the airframer by providing all the medical specifications associated with COVID-19 patients in intensive care and low care. The work took six weeks.

“The concept has been subsequently fine-tuned and Airbus is now in a position to offer a mature solution to any customers wishing to perform medevac operations,” says the airframer.

Many widebody aircraft, including A340-600s, have been grounded by the COVID-19 crisis. As such, there is ample capacity available for medevac solutions.

The A330/A340 Medevac conversion time is approximately five weeks from contract signature (and provided the medical kit is supplied). Conversions will take place at Airbus’ facility in Getafe, Spain.

Embraer, meanwhile, has revealed a medevac offering for its Phenom 300 series of aircraft. Called the Phenom 300MED, the solution can be purpose built, but is also available for retrofit. It was developed through a partnership with Aerolite, which designs interior equipment, and umlaut, a provider of advisory and fulfillment services.

Embraer and umlaut are jointly developing and certifying a new supplemental type certificate (STC) utilizing Aerolite equipment, explained the Brazilian airframer in a statement.

Over the last several months, many operators have pivoted from transporting people aboard their aircraft to instead carrying vital medical supplies and PPE by utilizing a number of creative engineering solutions to protect aircraft seats and other interior structures on board. Now, the aviation industry is stepping up again with air ambulance configurations for aircraft.

“Given the current health crisis, we are proud to be working with two world-class medevac-solutions partners, and we are primed to immediately start taking orders for this unprecedented air ambulance solution,” says Michael Amalfitano, president and CEO, Embraer Executive Jets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999890327453613}",neutral,0.9999890327453613,0
Arabsat orders all-electric Airbus satellite - SpaceNews,"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hcmFic2F0LW9yZGVycy1hbGwtZWxlY3RyaWMtYWlyYnVzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Fleet operator Arabsat of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, announced Aug. 18 it ordered a geostationary communications satellite from Airbus Defence and Space.

Arabsat said it plans to spend $300 million on the manufacture, launch, insurance and ground infrastructure for the satellite, called Badr-8.

The satellite is expected to launch in 2023 to provide C- and Ku-band coverage over Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. Arabsat, which operates a fleet of seven satellites, said it will position Badr-8 at its 26 degrees East orbital slot.

Airbus Defence and Space will build the satellite using Eurostar Neo, an all-electric platform designed with support from the French, British and European space agencies.

All-electric satellites move slower than their chemically-propelled counterparts, but require less volume for fuel, leaving more room for revenue-generating payloads.

Khalid Balkheyour, Arabsat president and chief executive, said Badr-8 will carry “massive satellite transponders for satellite TV broadcasting, satellite telecommunications and information exchanging services.”

Airbus said the 4,500-kilogram, 17-kilowatt satellite should take four to five months to reach geostationary orbit, depending on the launch vehicle Arabsat selects.

Badr-8 will also carry an experimental photonics feeder link from Airbus called Teleo to demonstrate optical communications that Airbus says will be “highly robust” against signal jammers.

Airbus is designing Badr-8 for a design life that exceeds 15 years, the company said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999945163726807}",neutral,0.9999945163726807,0

Microsoft Flight Simulator is even better with this Airbus flight stick - The Verge,"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMTM3MTc2Mi9taWNyb3NvZnQtZmxpZ2h0LXNpbXVsYXRvci1qb3lzdGljay10aHJ1c3RtYXN0ZXItc2lkZXN0aWNrLWFpcmJ1cy1lZGl0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Unless you are a hardcore fan of flight simulators, you probably don’t have a flight stick at your desk. There was a time when flight sticks, or more generic “joysticks,” were an essential PC gaming accessory, but Windows’ support for Xbox-style gamepads grew as the demand for games that simulate aerial and space combat decreased. Now, they’re somewhat of a niche product.

That may well change this year. Tomorrow sees the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator, a gorgeous and ambitious project that marks an incredible upgrade for the series — and it’ll be available to anyone on Xbox Game Pass. Later this fall, meanwhile, Star Wars: Squadrons promises to re-create the tense space battles of the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games from the ‘90s. I wouldn’t dream of playing either with a gamepad, so I wanted to find a good entry-level flight stick that’ll do them justice.

Related How Microsoft Flight Simulator returned to the skies

I expect that Thrustmaster’s new $69.99 Airbus-branded Sidestick, which I’ve been testing for a while, will be a popular choice. (Its full name is the TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition.) It’s designed as a 1:1 replica of the sidestick used in the Airbus A320 — a famous differentiator from Boeing’s traditional yokes — and it works with Microsoft Flight Simulator right out of the box without any need for setup.

I wouldn’t describe the Sidestick as a premium product, as it does feel a little plasticky in places. But overall, I was impressed for the price. The base is solid enough, the movement of the stick itself is convincing, and it’s just vastly more satisfying to use than a gamepad.

The Sidestick is not lacking in input options or customizability. There are 12 buttons on the base and four on the stick, as well as an 8-way hat switch (for looking around the cockpit), a twist lock, and a throttle slider that can be configured to serve as an extra “button” at the bottom of its throw. The stick also ships with swappable side buttons that let you set it up as the right or left seat of an airliner based on where you place the wider red button module, or you can go with the narrow or wide options on both sides.

The throttle slider is the Sidestick’s biggest weak point. It feels flimsy, and the markings on the stick’s base don’t do much to help you gauge positioning. It does the job, though, and if you want to upgrade down the line, this Sidestick is compatible with Thrustmaster’s TCA ecosystem of pedals and throttles. A matching $99.99 Airbus throttle quadrant is set to ship next month.

I can’t claim to be experienced in the mechanics of flying actual planes, but I can say that Microsoft Flight Simulator feels infinitely more convincing with this Thrustmaster Sidestick than an Xbox gamepad. The way it provides more resistance and gives you finer control over three axes of movement in the air is really not something you can replicate with a little thumbstick. A stick like this, if not this specific one, should be considered essential for Flight Simulator.

In preparation for Star Wars: Squadrons, I also went back and tested the Sidestick with some old games like TIE Fighter and X-Wing Alliance, and it worked great, despite being ostensibly designed for simulating civil aviation. These Star Wars games relied heavily on keyboard controls back in the day even if you did have a joystick, but the Sidestick’s banks of programmable buttons are useful for things like managing shields and laser power on the fly.

If you’re interested in these games, you should really think about getting a flight stick, and Thrustmaster’s TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is about as solid an entry-level option as I could imagine. At $69.99, it’s in the ballpark of regular Xbox One controller pricing, but it offers something entirely different. The only problem might be getting your hands on one since it’s already out of stock through Microsoft — but if you can, it comes highly recommended for what it is.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999191761016846}",neutral,0.9999191761016846,0

Aug. 11 (UPI) -- NATO received the second plane in a fleet of multi-role aircraft it's assembling this week. According to a press release from the alliance, an Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft arrived in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on Monday. Advertisement

NATO plans to assemble a fleet of eight of the aircraft by the end of 2024, but there's a contract option to expand the number of aircraft in the fleet to 11.

The first aircraft in the fleet was delivered at the end of June.

The A330 MRTT, a derivative of Airbus' A330-220 civilian airliner, can carry up to 245,000 pounds of fuel for refueling operations and its own use.

It's configured for in-flight refueling, the transport of passengers and cargo and medical evacuation operations, according to Airbus.

The plane is used by militaries in South Korea, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Australia, United Arab Emirates and Singapore.

Six NATO allies -- Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway -- pooled resources for NATO's aircraft initiative.

The aircraft are owned by NATO and will be operated by a multinational unit comprised of military personnel from the participating countries. The unit will be located at a Main Operating Base in Eindhoven, officials said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999905824661255}",neutral,0.9999905824661255,0

The aircraft will be multi-role capable and can be equipped for various types of missions, such as troop transport, different MedEvac role setups (medical evacuation) and will be operated by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe). Lufthansa Technik has now placed a total order of five Airbus aircraft on behalf of the German Government: three ACJ350-900s and two A321LRs. The A321LRs will be able to fly up to 163 passengers, up to 6 intensive care patients and up to 12 medium care patients, depending on the installed configuration, with a maximum range of 4,200nm/7,800km or 9.5 flight hours.



“We are thrilled Lufthansa Technik has become the launch customer for the ACJ long-range version of the world’s best-selling A321neo,” said Benoit Defforge, ACJ President. “The ACJ320 Family features the widest cabin of any single-aisle aircraft in the sky, providing the greatest passenger comfort and intercontinental range. Lufthansa Technik and the German Government have a long-standing relationship with Airbus and we are proud of this new milestone order with us.”

The A321LR is a member of the A320neo Family with over 7,400 orders by more than 110 customers. It delivers 30 per cent fuel savings and nearly 50 per cent reduction in noise footprint compared to previous generation competitor aircraft. With a range of up to 4,000nm (7,400km), with 206 passengers, the A321LR is the unrivalled long-range route opener, featuring true transatlantic capability and premium wide-body comfort in a single-aisle aircraft cabin.

Featuring the most spacious cabins of any business jet, while being similar in size to competing large-cabin aircraft, the ACJ320neo Family also delivers similar operating costs. The ACJ320neo Family can do this because its lower maintenance and training overheads – part of its airliner heritage – deliver a similar total cost when combined with fuel and navigation and landing charges.

Some 12,000 Airbus aircraft are in service worldwide, supported by a globe-spanning network of spares and training centres, giving corporate jet customers unmatched support in the field. Airbus corporate jet customers also benefit from services tailored to their particular needs, such as the “one call handles all” corporate jet customer care centre (C4you), and customised maintenance programmes.

Combined with the inherent reliability that comes from aircraft designed to fly many times a day, the ACJ320neo Family is both dependable and available when customers need it.

Airbus corporate jets are part of the world’s most modern aircraft family, which delivers, as standard, features which either cost more, or are unavailable, in competitors. These features include the protection and simplicity of fly-by-wire controls, the benefits of Category 3B autoland, and time and cost-saving centralised maintenance on all systems.

Around 200 Airbus corporate jets are in service on every continent, including Antarctica, highlighting their versatility in challenging environments.

Love them or hate them, low-cost airlines democratize the airline industry so more people have the means to travel. While Spirit won't be my first choice moving forward, I wouldn't have any problem taking them again if the price is right, even during the pandemic.

For longer flights, however, I would be willing to pay more as the seats were not conducive to comfort after long stretches due to the lack of legroom and even a headrest.

I definitely got what I paid for but what really made Spirit shine was the helpful and accommodating cabin crew. Instead of strictly sticking to the seat map and letting passengers sort the rest out, the flight attendants proactively moved passengers to make sure that the flight was an enjoyable experience, which is more than I can say for some of the other airlines I've flown since March.

The crew – along with Spirit's enhanced cleaning procedures and practices – proved that low-cost doesn't necessarily mean less safe, especially as major airlines like United and American aren't blocking middle seats either. There is some responsibility on the part of the passenger to ensure distancing as it was clear not everybody on the plane was overly concerned but that can be found on any airline.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9929360747337341}",neutral,0.9929360747337341,0
Pegasus talks to Airbus about changes to A320neo-family deliveries - Flightglobal,"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxlZXRzL3BlZ2FzdXMtdGFsa3MtdG8tYWlyYnVzLWFib3V0LWNoYW5nZXMtdG8tYTMyMG5lby1mYW1pbHktZGVsaXZlcmllcy8xMzk4NDAuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish budget carrier Pegasus has indicated that it will push back some aircraft deliveries, as it continues negotiations with Airbus regarding the A320neo-family twinjets it has on order.

The airline’s second-quarter results presentation – released on 12 August – states that while it still intends to take 55 new aircraft in the 2021-2024 timeframe, more will arrive later in the period. Specifically, it has reduced its intake in 2022 from 18 to 11 aircraft, with its 2023 intake rising from 10 to 17 jets.

The seven extra aircraft listed in the 2023 intake are the larger A321neo variant, while the seven removed in 2022 are A320neos.

Those changes mean that once the carrier has taken 11 A320neos and five A321neos in 2021, it plans to only take the latter variant in 2022-2024: 11, 17 and 10 respectively each year.

The carrier would not comment on the specifics of its fleet projection, stating that negotiations with the airframer are ongoing.

Pegasus is still aiming to have a fleet of 108 aircraft at year-end 2024, according to the presentation, featuring 54 A320neos, 50 A321neos and four Boeing 737-800s – totals that reflect the uptick of seven A321neos at the expense of seven A320neos.

The carrier’s planning continues to represent a significant overhaul of its current fleet, which on 30 June this year featured 37 737-800s, 35 A320neos, 12 A320ceos and five A321neos.

It took delivery of three A320neos and three A321neos during the second quarter, utilising Airbus’s remote delivery process.

The changes to Pegasus’ fleet projections came as the Istanbul-headquartered operator recorded an operating loss of €109 million ($129 million) for the second quarter, compared with a profit of €71 million in the same period of 2019, amid the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

A net loss of €120 million was driven “primarily by the negative operating result”, but Pegasus also notes a €35 million negative impact from fuel hedges.

Revenue in the second quarter was down 95% year on year at €22 million – compared with €407 million in the second quarter of 2019 – as scheduled flights were grounded during April and May, with domestic services resuming on 1 June and international sectors from the middle of that month.

During the quarter, Pegasus says its costs were down 75% year on year at €100 million. Cash fixed costs were cut by 60%, the airline notes, citing measures including the government’s support package for wages, unpaid leave, deferred and renegotiated supplier payments, and reduced MRO activity.

A “strong focus on liquidity” continues, the carrier states, with Pegasus recording cash and equivalents at the end of the second quarter of €564 million, up from €486 million at the end of March. That increase was achieved through €53 million cashback received from a €103 million margin call on fuel hedges paid in the first quarter, while it also added €93 million via a bank loan that was drawn down during the second quarter.

It estimates its monthly cash burn during the grounding of its fleet at €33 million.

Beyond the second quarter, the budget carrier says that its domestic capacity in July was at 76% of the level flown in the same month of 2019, while passenger numbers were at 58% year on year. International capacity was at 22% of July 2019 levels and passenger numbers at 15%, amid “ongoing travel restrictions”.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8453019857406616}",negative,0.8453019857406616,-1

In our first installment of the series we said goodbye to the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747-400. In this story, we stick with the “4 engines 4 long haul” theme but switch gears from Boeing to Airbus.

With fewer people flying, plus the increasing use of fuel-efficient two-engine long-haul planes in airline fleets, older quad-engine planes are dropping like flies. No surprise, then that a number of airlines retired their Airbus A340 and A380s fleets. The A380 is a unique behemoth, the largest and arguably most-comfortable passenger plane around. And its older sister, the elegant A340, has captured AvGeeks eyes and hearts around the world.

Read on as we take a stroll down memory lane as we say goodbye to a few A340 and A380s.

Airbus A380

Air France

Au Revoir, Air France A380: This Grand Dame Was Getting a Little Lame – One of my last pre-COVID flights was a transatlantic leg from Paris to New York on an Air France A380. It was a great reminder of how majestic the plane was. But the onboard experience honestly wasn’t great, with a business class that felt more like premium economy.

Still, there were tons of fun AvGeek moments, like a tail cam takeoff view (see below), the bizarro “art gallery” at the front of the upper deck, and the whisper-quiet ride.

%CODE1%

Flight Review: Air France A380 In Premium Economy – A meticulously detailed trip report of a honeymoon flight from San Francisco to Paris from Senior Correspondent John Nguyen back in 2015. Back then, the plane was a little fresher, though the experience overall was still a bit hit-or-miss.

Qantas

Fortunately Qantas hasn’t permanently retired their A380s, but they’ve mothballed them until at least 2023. Depending on how travel trends play out in the coming years, it’s not impossible that they might leave the skies for good.

First Class Adventures On a Qantas Airbus A380 – Last year, Colin Cook had the chance to try Qantas in every cabin class they offer. His first class flight was on an A380, and it was a dream of a time. And with the amount of space available on A380 first class, it’s easy to see why. It’s definitely one of our can’t-miss trip reports from the archives. Also check out Mal Muir’s trip report on the same plane and cabin from back in 2013.

Qantas to Take Back a Few World Records By Changing to an A380 – Back in 2014, Qantas took back the crown of world’s longest A380 flight by converting their direct Sydney-Dallas flight to an A380. And more recently, Qantas had been looking into options to sustainably operate direct flights from Australia to London, though that won’t be doable from Sydney or Perth with the A380.

Competitors can sometimes be friends, though, and we can’t forget this amazing Qantas-Emirates A380 formation flight back in 2013.

Lufthansa

German mega-airline Lufthansa is retiring half of its A380 fleet due to COVID. So while you’ll still be able to fly the great white whale on Lufthansa, it will be a rarer opportunity.

Video Tour of Lufthansa Airlines Airbus A380 First Class – Way back in 2011 we got a look at the Lufthansa A380 first class cabin. Then and now, it’s the airline’s premium-est premium cabin. And boy, does it impress.

Hitching a Ride With Lufthansa On Their Frankfurt to Miami Inaugural A380 Flight – Another gem from back when the Lufthansa A380 was much newer and more exciting. Click and read to relive the glory days of the gradual A380 rollout to the Americas.

Flying Upper Deck Economy on a Lufthansa Airbus A380 – My very first AirlineReporter story was on a Lufthansa A380. Admittedly it’s not a great report. But since I was flying on the upper deck of a dual-deck plane for the first time, it was a special flight for me.

There’s a few other airlines that may sideline or shelve their A380s before all’s done with COVID. But for now, that’s it for the A380 fun. It’s an impressive plane with plenty of quirks — curvy stairs and all. Now let’s turn our attention to the A340.

Airbus A340

Lufthansa

Wait, didn’t we just talk about Lufthansa? Well, it’s no surprise that the airline that led the pack in COVID fleet drawbacks also decided to shelve its aging fuel-hungry four-engine A340s. In general, there was no doubt that A340s everywhere were in trouble when COVID came calling. Even way way back in 2012, we published “A Farewell to the Airbus A340.”

Anyways, back to Lufthansa. Just like with their A380s, some of the planes may go into storage for good, while some could possibly rejoin the fleet later. We don’t have any full-length stories on the Lufthansa A340 but a while back we did have a reader send in a cool photo they took of a LH A340-600. So, here you go! (Thanks, reader Drew)

Virgin Atlantic

The A340 was one of the mainstays of Virgin Atlantic’s long-haul fleet. But especially since the Dreamliner joined the fleet, it was clear that the A340’s days were numbered.

Flying on Bubbles – Upper Class on a Virgin Atlantic A340-600 – Correspondent Jonathan Trent-Carlson took us onboard a business class — oops I mean “Upper Class” — ride on an A340-600. It was his first-ever time on a widebody plane, so it was an extra-special ride.

Air France

At least as of the last update we heard, Air France is permanently shelving their A340s, some of which were used for the short-lived “millennial airline” Joon.

Video: Air France A340 Aborts Landing at St Maarten During Hurricane Isaac – Not our video, but it was crazy enough that we wrote a story on it back in 2012. This is all we have in the archives about the Air France A340, though.

That’s all for this tribute! There’s a LOT of unpredictability in what airlines are doing with their fleets. So there may be more A380s and A340s that fly off into the sunset before this is all over. On the flip side, if air travel rebounds faster than expected, maybe some of these retired planes will return back to service. Who knows. For now, share your own A380 and A340 stories in the comments section below.

"Airbus’s Latest VIP Helicopter Is Lighter, Faster and Quieter Than Any in Its Class - Robb Report","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL25ldy1haXJidXMtYWNoMTYwLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWhhcy1nYW1lLWNoYW5naW5nLWludGVyaW9yLTI5MzY3Njgv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hY2gxNjAtZXhjbHVzaXZlLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItaGFzLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdpbmctaW50ZXJpb3ItMjkzNjc2OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arriving in the US later this fall, the eagerly anticipated ACH160 Exclusive is a step up from Airbus’s previous generation of executive helicopters. The new interior is a game changer, with its improved sound insulation and expansive, double-paned windows that open up the view even as they cut back on engine noise.

Co-created by Airbus and yacht designer Harrison Eidsgaard, the ACH160 was designed to provide a large blank canvas for whatever an owner wants in the cabin: lounge chairs arranged for a tête-à-tête, three seats across or any other configuration of seating for up to eight. Having one of the world’s most sought-after yacht designers create an executive helicopter interior made sense, since the Eidsgaard team filled the cabin with every inch of functional space for passengers while retaining the minimal, elegant look.

The quality after completion is also worth noting. Airbus’ obsessive attention to detail shows beyond the avionics and technical components. It comes through in the grain-matched veneers and other woodwork with as many as eight coats of varnish. It is displayed in the ergonomics of small but important details, such as the outer steps that lower at the touch of a button, and get close to the ground for easier boarding.

The chopper’s intuitive Helionix flight deck is also a technical assist for the pilots, with two to four multifunction screens on both sides of the cockpit that display pertinent information in real time, as the pilots need it. The functions can be divided in multiple modes, so the pilot and copilot can monitor different systems simultaneously. The Helionix 3 is a true breakthrough in helicopter avionics.

The new Safran turboshaft engines deliver a fast cruise speed of 172.6 mph and a range of 512 miles, while burning 15 percent less fuel. The ACH160 will have a maximum endurance of four hours and 30 minutes.

Airbus delivers first of 16 advanced law enforcement H125 helicopters to U.S. CBP - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1vZi0xNi1hZHZhbmNlZC1sYXctZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQtaDEyNS1oZWxpY29wdGVycy10by11LXMtY2JwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (AHI) has delivered the first of 16 new H125 helicopters uniquely configured for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO). AMO collaborated with AHI as part of a long-term fleet upgrade initiative, and the resulting configuration has led to one of the most advanced, high-tech law enforcement helicopters ever developed.

“Our mission is to safeguard the nation by anticipating and confronting security threats,” said Steve Boyer, deputy executive assistant commissioner for AMO. “Airbus Helicopters’ continued commitment to designing, manufacturing, and delivering quality products will enable AMO personnel to successfully and safely carry out this mission.”

The first helicopter for the new configuration was tested and delivered from Airbus Helicopters, Inc.’s facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. The remaining aircraft are being built in Columbus, Mississippi, where a workforce made up of 40 percent U.S. veterans also produces the UH-72A Lakota for the U.S. Army and has delivered more than 450 single-engine H125 aircraft for the North American market.

Following a rigorous analysis of its mission needs and next generation aerospace technology, AMO developed a set of requirements for the new helicopters, which Airbus put in place through nearly 30 supplemental type certificates (STCs). The series of STCs are tied together through a primary all-encompassing STC that ensures all of the systems interact properly with one another and with the basic aircraft.

Airbus and AMO have a longstanding relationship of more than 30 years, during which Airbus has delivered more than 100 helicopters from the H120 and H125 family. This new acquisition was made possible through a partnership with Davenport Aviation, an SBA-certified woman-owned small business and HUBZone contractor specializing in the supply of aerospace equipment to federal, state and local government agencies.

“We are honored to partner with Airbus Helicopters and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to support this fleet upgrade for enhanced law enforcement capabilities through the procurement of 16 new H125 helicopters from our GSA contract,” said Leah Simoes, owner and chairwoman of Davenport Aviation. “Throughout this project, we have been very appreciative of the support we have received from Airbus and CBP of our WOSB, HUBZone Certified small business.”

Known for its power, versatility and excellent performance in hot and high conditions, the H125 features dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, a crash resistant fuel system, and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays. The H125 is the single most popular law enforcement helicopter in the U.S., accounting for nearly half of all helicopters delivered for that mission in North America over the last decade.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5332481265068054}",neutral,0.5332481265068054,0

Yahsat begins Thuraya fleet refresh with Airbus satellite order - SpaceNews,"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS95YWhzYXQtYmVnaW5zLXRodXJheWEtZmxlZXQtcmVmcmVzaC13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Emirati fleet operator Yahsat on Aug. 27 announced a contract with Airbus Defence and Space to build a satellite for its Thuraya mobile voice and data connectivity subsidiary, beginning a long-awaited refresh of its L-band network.

The contract covers a satellite designated Thuraya-4 NGS, and includes an option for a Thuraya-5 NGS satellite that, if exercised, would complete the replacement of Thuraya’s aging two-satellite fleet of Boeing-built spacecraft.

Yahsat Chief Executive Masood M. Sharif Mahmood said during a video call with reporters the company will spend around $500 million to build and launch the Thuraya-4 NGS satellite, refresh Thuraya’s ground network, and update its suite of mobile communications products.

The satellite will provide voice and data connectivity over the Middle East, Africa, Europe and Central Asia. Ali Al Hashemi, CEO of Thuraya and general manager of Yahsat’s Government Solutions division, said the company is seeking proposals for ground segment upgrades and a 2024 launch of Thuraya-4 NGS, an all-electric satellite expected to weigh several metric tons.

A decision on whether to exercise its Thuraya-5 NGS option will wait until Thuraya has a strong business plan in place for serving the Asia-Pacific market, both executives said.

Thuraya had announced plans in 2016 to develop a new geostationary satellite constellation called Futura, but the project stalled for want of financing. Yahsat, owned by the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned investment company Mubadala, acquired Thuraya in 2018, providing stable financial footing. Mahmood said Thuraya-4 NGS will be funded using Yahsat and Thuraya’s combined cash flow.

Yahsat operates a fleet of three satellites that provide broadband, television broadcast and other high-capacity C-, Ku- and Ka-band services to businesses and government agencies across the Middle East, Africa, Central and Southwest Asia and parts of South America. Thuraya’s two operational satellites provide telephony and low-data-rate L-band services to customers in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific.

Thuraya 4-NGS will be built using an Airbus Eurostar Neo satellite platform, a 12-meter L-band antenna, and a payload processor that can adjust power levels for 250 communications beams, said François Gaullier, Airbus Defence and Space senior vice president of telecommunications satellite systems.

Mahmood said Thuraya-4 NGS will have significantly more capacity than Thuraya-2 and -3, allowing Thuraya to introduce more data-intensive connectivity applications, he said.

Yahsat will have a team of Emirati engineers shadowing Thuraya-4 NGS manufacturing at Airbus as part of a knowledge transfer program for the country, Mahmood said. Thuraya-4 NGS will weigh more than 5,000 kilograms and be built to last more than 15 years, according to Airbus.

No rush on Thuraya-5 NGS

Thuraya-4 NGS will replace the older of Thuraya’s two operational satellites, Thuraya-2, which launched in 2003 and is now five years past its 12-year design life. Thuraya-2 has enough fuel to remain in service until its replacement is in orbit in 2024, Mahmood said.

Thuraya’s other satellite, Thuraya-3, launched in 2008 and reached its 12-year service life earlier this year.

Geostationary operators often fly their satellites longer than their design life, and Thuraya is no exception. Mahmood said Thuraya-3 remains in good health and would be “extremely premature” to replace, regardless of age.

“We have an extensive amount of time ahead of us, and there is no reason to pull the trigger today on that [contract] option when in reality we have a completely functional system that is working and serving our markets,” he said.

Thuraya-3’s relative youth also buys Thuraya more time to assess the Asia-Pacific market, where Thuraya is seeing less demand for the kind of turnkey solutions it’s been able to sell in regions served by Thuraya-2.

“As for the [Asia-Pacific] … we’re still in the process to develop a business plan of how to capture market share there. The business philosophy in that region, [we are] finding, is totally different,” Hashemi said.

In Thuraya’s home market and neighboring regions, Hashemi said, “the focus was mostly on solutions, finding government solutions or solutions that would fit the needs of the customer, while in the [Asia-Pacific] region we found that having cheap devices, reliable cheap devices, or let’s say the volume of play, is more important.”

Hashemi and Mahmood said they are still open to Thuraya eventually becoming a global provider of L-band connectivity, like competitors Iridium and Inmarsat, but for the time being consider it more important to extract additional growth from markets in which Thuraya is already present.

Global coverage is a major benefit for aeronautical connectivity, but Thuraya is focused mainly on maritime, government and defense, Mahmood said, making it less important for the company.

Thuraya currently has around 250,000 active subscribers, down from 300,000 in 2018. Mahmood said Thuraya’s focus has tightened under Yahsat ownership to prioritize customer value over subscriber numbers. He declined to state Thuraya’s revenue.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0
Airbus A380 Through The Years - Aviation Week,"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXRocm91Z2gteWVhcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380 Through The Years

Singapore Airlines took delivery of the first of five new Airbus A380s on Dec. 13, 2017, which replaced five older A380s from the fleet. In the pandemic era of 2020, SIA took the A380 fleet out of service and today has no timeframe when its current fleet of 19 A380s will return to service. Only one former SIA A380 found a new operator, Portuguese wet-lease specialist Hi Fly.

Qatar Airways Group CEO in with the airline’s first A380, which he believed would be a success. Today, his opinion about the economic performance of the aircraft has changed.

Qatar Airways outlined plans in January to reduce its A380 fleet from 10 aircraft to five. However, rather than citing the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker cited concerns about the aircraft's environmental impact as a factor in the carrier's decision.

In September 2008, Qantas took delivery of its first of 12 A380s, which was named Nancy-Bird Walton, an Australian aviation pioneer. Outgoing CEO Geoff Dixon (right) joined the delivery flight, as well as incoming CEO Alan Joyce, who is still CEO. During COVID-19, Qantas transferred all 12 A380s to Victorville, California, for long-term storage. It will take three years for Qantas to get its fleet back in air—depending on the global coronavirus pandemic and related travel restrictions.

One of the first A380s built at Airbus in Toulouse.

Even before the crisis hit, A380s were already starting to be phased out by airlines.

As the COVID-19 pandemic era unfolds, Lufthansa was initially planning to keep eight of its 14 A380s when it expected long-haul demand to return faster. Six of the type were sold back to Airbus. Currently, the airline is moving toward a decision to not return any of the A380 to revenue service. If they return, they would only fly from Lufthansa’s Munich hub, where the terminal infrastructure is a much better fit for A380 operations.

The Residence is located in the Upper Deck, in there very front of the aircraft. Etihad uses this space as a sleeping room.

The first Airbus A380 for Abu Dhabi´s Etihad Airways has been delivered in December 2014. Etihad plans to bring A380 service back again after the industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emirates Airline took delivery of its 100th A380 in November 2017. The Dubai-based airline currently operates the A380 from Dubai to Amsterdam, Cairo, Paris, London Heathrow, Toronto and Guangzhou, out of a fleet of 115 aircraft. The number of A380 destinations is expected to grow further.

Japans ANA became the last A380 customer. ANA and Airbus management at the Airbus delivery center in Toulouse in March 2019.

On May 15, 2013, German car manufacturer Mercedes chartered an Airbus A380 as a static display to present the new Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse automobile at Hamburg Finkenwerder. The event included an Alicia Keys concert. The aircraft was flown in directly from Toulouse for this event.

The short-lived Airbus A380 program has become another victim of the coronavirus pandemic, as many airlines are retiring some of the very large aircraft, or entire fleets. Even before the coronavirus crisis, the A380 was uneconomical for most airlines, with a few exceptions such as Emirates Airline. In COVID-19 market conditions, there are not nearly enough passengers to justify its use.

As of July 2020, there were 251 net orders for the A380. Of that number, 242 aircraft have been delivered to 15 operators, including Air France, Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana, British Airways, China Southern, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Korean Air, Hi Fly (second hand), Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways.

Most A380s are currently grounded and many of them will most likely never return to service. Here is the current status:

Air France phased out its fleet of 10 A380s, two years earlier than planned. The oldest aircraft was delivered only in 2009.

British Airways has 12 A380s in storage and is questioning whether such large aircraft would be needed again.

Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways plans to bring the A380 service back again in the future. Lufthansa was initially planning to keep eight of its 14 A380s when it expected long-haul demand to return faster. Six of the type were sold back to Airbus. Currently, the airline is moving toward a decision to not return any of the A380 to revenue service. If they return, they would only fly from Lufthansa’s Munich hub, where the terminal infrastructure is a much better fit for A380 operations.

Qantas transferred all 12 A380s to Victorville, California, for long-term storage. It will take three years for Qantas to get its fleet back in air—depending on the global coronavirus pandemic and related travel restrictions.

Qatar Airways, which operates 10 of the very large aircraft, expects to have the fleet grounded over the next year or year-and-a-half. Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker told Aviation Week, that’s not all A380s will return in service. Singapore Airlines currently has no timeframe when its fleet of 19 A380s could return to service, when it makes economic sense. The second-hand market remains uncertain.

Only one former Singapore Airlines A380 found a new operator, wet-lease specialist Hi Fly from Portugal.

Currently, there are only two airlines in the world that are operating A380s—China Southern Airlines, which has five in its fleet, and Dubai-based Emirates Airline. However, the number of Emirates A380s in operation must be marginal. It only operates the A380 from Dubai to Amsterdam, Cairo, Paris, London Heathrow, Toronto and Guangzhou, out of a fleet of 115 aircraft. The number of A380 destinations is expected to grow further.

Airbus builds first of 16 helicopters for Customs and Border Protection - The Commercial Dispatch,"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY2Rpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1idWlsZHMtZmlyc3Qtb2YtMTYtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZm9yLWN1c3RvbXMtYW5kLWJvcmRlci1wcm90ZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first H125 helicopter assembled at Airbus’ Lowndes County facility for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has already been delivered to Detroit, Michigan, for CBP agents to use during operations.

Over the next 14 months, local Airbus employees will build and deliver 15 more as part of a long-term fleet upgrade initiative for CBP.

“Customs and Border Protection ordered 16 helicopters to start replacing their aging fleet of helicopters, some of which are 30 years old,” Airbus CEO Romain Trapp told The Dispatch on Wednesday. “So what we are celebrating here today is the beginning of the delivery of these 16 helicopters.”

The helicopters are custom-designed specifically for CBP, and Trapp said they include features specially tailored for law enforcement, such as loud speakers, infrared cameras and searchlights “which are needed for the missions of CBP, which every day are about protecting people and chasing the bad guys.”

Legislators including Rep. Trent Kelly, Sen. Roger Wicker and state Sen. Chuck Younger, along with CBP officials visited Airbus in Columbus Wednesday to tour the facility and meet with employees. U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith was also on the program but had to cancel at the last minute due to a family emergency.

“We are here today to make a statement to you, these teammates and these people that make America work, that we are committed to this aircraft,” Wicker said in an address to employees. “We are committed to production and we’re doing it for the right reason. We love employees. We love jobs in Mississippi and jobs in America. But the main point we’re making is this aircraft is essential to the security of the United States of America, and we all benefit from it.”

Airbus has built more than 100 helicopters for CBP since 1987, and they currently make up about 50 percent of the department’s fleet and 65 percent of the department’s flight hours, said Steve Boyer, deputy executive assistant commissioner of policy, Air and Marine Operations at CBP.

“We use this fleet every day,” he said, “in everything from narcotics operations to national events like the Super Bowl.”

He and Executive Director of Operations, Air and Marine Operations Dennis Michelin said the new helicopters provide security for agents on the ground during investigations and operations. Kelly, in his remarks to employees, added CBP’s helicopters have been used in search and rescue missions in remote areas near the border as well as for patrol and other law enforcement procedures.

“It’s just changed the way we do business,” Boyer later told The Dispatch. “It’s allowed us to work more effectively. It’s efficient. It’s a safety net for our employees that are on the ground that we’ve never had before, so it’s a game-changer.”

Trapp said Airbus will deliver one helicopter a month through October 2021.

Airbus opened its facility in Columbus in 2003 and expanded in 2006. More than 750 employees — about 40 percent of whom are veterans — currently work at the facility, according to an Airbus press release distributed at the event.

Legislators said it is Mississippi and the Golden Triangle area’s skilled workforce that makes the production of such high-tech equipment possible.

Younger told employees he is proud to have such a “jewel” as the Airbus facility in his district, which not all Mississippi legislators can say.

“This is quality. I wish they would make a pick-up for me on the farm because I don’t believe you could tear it up,” he joked.

Both Kelly and Wicker said there are pockets of high-tech industry all over the state, but especially in the Golden Triangle.

“You can’t get any more American-made than that helicopter here in Mississippi,” Kelly said. “… You have technology and defense-driven businesses that are coming to Mississippi.”

Wicker called the Golden Triangle’s industrial development opportunities “a howling success.”

“Hardly anybody does it better than the Golden Triangle, whether it’s training or job creation or industrial recruitment,” he said. “… We got drones, we got steel. We got the most sophisticated aircraft in the world.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999569654464722}",neutral,0.9999569654464722,0

BADR-8 will replace and increase Arabsat’s capacity and augment its core business at the BADR hotspot 26°E.

The BADR-8 satellite will be based on the-state-of-the-art Airbus Eurostar Neo electric orbit raising platform giving access to a wide range of launchers.

BADR-8 will also include the innovative Airbus developed TELEO optical communications payload demonstrator. This payload will enable very high capacity analogue optical feeder link communications, as part of the development by Airbus of a new generation of optical communications technology in space to be integrated in its future commercial products, which is highly robust against jamming.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems, said: “This important contract with our long-standing customer Arabsat has a special significance for Airbus Defence and Space. It is the first seventh-generation Arabsat satellite and the first Eurostar Neo satellite we are building for Arabsat after six previous Eurostar satellites. BADR-8 incorporates the best of our expertise and technologies, including a very innovative optical communications hosted payload. This further strengthens our continuing strategic partnership with the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation, which has been connecting people by satellite across the Middle East and the world for more than 40 years.”

Khalid Balkheyour, President and CEO of Arabsat said “We are delighted to sign this contract with our long term partner Airbus. It marks another milestone in our objectives to provide customers with premium satellite technology with the highest level of performance, and to expand reliability and service security. BADR-8 will be joining our Badr-network at Arabsat 26°E hotspot, expanding our service over EMEA region.”

The satellite is scheduled for launch in 2023 and its electric propulsion system will enable it to reach geostationary orbit in four to five months, depending on the type of launcher used. It has been designed to remain in service in orbit for more than 15 years. The satellite will have a launch mass of around 4.5 tonnes and power of 17 kW.

This new contract reinforces Airbus Defence and Space’s position as the world’s number one in electric propulsion satellites, with three full electric satellites operational in orbit and 15 additional full electric high-capacity telecommunications satellites under construction.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7370268702507019}",positive,0.7370268702507019,1

""This is the world's first government aircraft of this type and thus also the world's first Airbus A350 not to be used in commercial airline service.""

BERLIN, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The first of three new Airbus A350-900s was officially handed over to the German Armed Forces, Lufthansa Technik announced on Thursday.

""This is the world's first government aircraft of this type and thus also the world's first Airbus A350 not to be used in commercial airline service,"" Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of the German airline Lufthansa, said in a statement.

""The exemplary procurement process is really something to be proud of,"" Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in the statement. ""The decision to purchase the new A350 fleet was made only one and a half years ago.""

Kramp-Karrenbauer took a first look at the ""future flagship"" of the ministry's Special Air Mission Wing in Hamburg during a handover ceremony, the statement noted.

Effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains had ""slightly delayed the planned delivery"" of the aircraft to the German Armed Forces, according to Lufthansa Technik.

During the next weeks, the new wide-body aircraft will receive its military certification and various test flights would take place. According to Lufthansa Technik, the two sister planes are still under construction.

In total, the three aircraft cost around 1.2 billion euros (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), the Ministry of Defense announced last year. ■","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999910593032837}",neutral,0.9999910593032837,0

The AHNA Training Center in Grand Prairie, Texas, has long been a USAIG Safety Bucks program participant. That program enables policyholders that operate turbine-powered helicopters to select $2,500 in Safety Bucks to go toward helicopter pilot or maintenance technician training expenses in each year of policy coverage.

USAIG started the Safety Bucks program in the 1990s to assist and incentivize policyholders to make recurrent helicopter simulator training standard practice. It was later expanded to include helicopter maintenance technician training and some in-aircraft training activities. In 2015, it was integrated into USAIG’s broader Performance Vector safety initiative, which provides a portfolio of safety services from which eligible policyholders can make one annual selection.

“Safety Bucks is a great option as the annual safety benefit for many of our helicopter policyholders,” said Kevin Kovarik, USAIG Senior Vice President and Lead for Rotary Wing Underwriting. “We are proud to boost the reach and positive impact of our policyholders’ safety and training resources, and excited to continue expanding opportunities with Airbus Helicopters.”

The AHNA Training Center in Texas boasts a wide range of opportunities for operators to apply Safety Bucks. The training center leverages its experienced instructors and modernized fleet of company-owned training aircraft and training devices to deliver world-class initial and recurrent maintenance and flight training courses for the light-through-heavy range of Airbus Helicopters models.

The AHNA Training Center looks forward to the upcoming rollout of a new level D H145 full flight simulator by its simulation partner Helisim LLC, which already owns and operates AS350, EC1335, and EC145 simulation devices. These simulators complement Airbus Helicopters’ initial, recurrent, and safety courses such as Inadvertent Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IIMC), which was designed to combat the increasing number of fatal IIMC accidents by providing pilots with effective avoidance and recovery techniques.

USAIG, Airbus Helicopters, and Helisim recognize that IIMC training addresses a critical safety threat faced by the entire helicopter industry. That triggered a discussion about how USAIG could encourage its policyholders to have pilots attend the IIMC course, and a limited-time opportunity was born. USAIG and the AHNA Training Center will extend the value of a $2,500 USAIG Safety Bucks certificate to fully cover one pilot’s full IIMC course tuition (currently a $3,900 value) for courses booked within the remainder of calendar year 2020 and commenced before July 1, 2021. Safety Bucks will retain their standard face value when applied to any other AHNA Training Center courses.

“We believe the IIMC course is a must-have for any helicopter pilot,” said Lindsay Cunningham, head of customer training for AHNA, “and this limited-time offer is a great way for operators who are USAIG policyholders to benefit from the course while deriving maximum advantage from their Safety Bucks.”

USAIG continually upgrades its popular Performance Vector suite of safety programs to keep pace with changes and improvements in aviation safety protocols.

The new interior is a game changer, with its improved sound insulation and expansive, double-paned windows that open up the view even as they cut back on engine noise.

Co-created by Airbus and yacht designer Harrison Eidsgaard, the ACH160 was designed to provide a large blank canvas for whatever an owner wants in the cabin: lounge chairs arranged for a tête-à-tête, three seats across or any other configuration of seating for up to eight. Having one of the world’s most sought-after yacht designers create an executive helicopter interior made sense, since the Eidsgaard team filled the cabin with every inch of functional space for passengers while retaining the minimal, elegant look.

The quality after completion is also worth noting. Airbus’ obsessive attention to detail shows beyond the avionics and technical components. It comes through in the grain-matched veneers and other woodwork with as many as eight coats of varnish. It is displayed in the ergonomics of small but important details, such as the outer steps that lower at the touch of a button, and get close to the ground for easier boarding.

Airbus ACH160 Exclusive

The chopper’s intuitive Helionix flight deck is also a technical assist for the pilots, with two to four multifunction screens on both sides of the cockpit that display pertinent information in real time, as the pilots need it. The functions can be divided in multiple modes, so the pilot and copilot can monitor different systems simultaneously. The Helionix 3 is a true breakthrough in helicopter avionics.

The new Safran turboshaft engines deliver a fast cruise speed of 172.6 mph and a range of 512 miles, while burning 15 percent less fuel. The ACH160 will have a maximum endurance of four hours and 30 minutes.

Airbus eyeing interim German P-3C fleet replacement need - Flightglobal,"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZml4ZWQtd2luZy9haXJidXMtZXllaW5nLWludGVyaW0tZ2VybWFuLXAtM2MtZmxlZXQtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtbmVlZC8xMzk2MTQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space is pursuing an opportunity to provide Germany with an interim maritime patrol aircraft capability, after Berlin axed a delayed modernisation of its Lockheed P-3C Orion fleet.

The German navy has operated eight of the four-engined type since 2006, after acquiring them from the Netherlands. Cirium fleets data shows that the aircraft are aged between 35 and 38 years.

In mid-June, Berlin announced the termination of a cockpit and mission system update for the type, saying programme delays had caused “insufficient operational readiness, without any foreseeable improvement”. Valued at almost $220 million and awarded to Lockheed in late 2017, the contract had been expected to enable Orion operations to continue until 2035.

France and Germany have been jointly assessing their long-term requirements via a Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) effort, which is also intended to deliver replacements for the French navy’s Dassault ATL-2 Atlantique platforms.

Under their agreement, the nations plan to select a European platform existing in 2023 to form the basis of their capability. Airbus in 2018 outlined its intention to use the A320neo for such an application. Broader industrial participation in MAWS is likely to involve companies including Dassault, Hensoldt, Safran and Thales.

“A gap in capabilities resulting from the elimination of the P-3C Orion cannot be accepted,” Germany’s defence ministry said in mid-June. A market survey “that takes into account all platforms available on the market” was under way, it added, noting that this activity would “assess all interdependencies on the Franco-German [MAWS] co-operation project”.

“We are fully committed to provide an alternative solution [to Germany’s P-3Cs], and to stay a leader in the MAWS project, to ensure that our customer will select our proposal based on the A320,” Airbus Defence & Space head of tanker and derivatives programmes Didier Plantecoste tells FlightGlobal.

“We are articulating a proposal to Germany, to answer their need for maritime patrol capability,” he says, while adding: “We would like to protect the MAWS programme.”

Despite the challenges posed by Berlin’s interim requirement, Plantecoste says: “The MAWS project is more alive than ever. We see more important momentum in our discussion with all the parties, and are looking to be involved in a new development phase, which for us should start next year.

“If we do not succeed in having France and Germany together, we will not be able to develop such a capability,” Plantecoste cautions. “A maritime patrol aircraft of that size is something requiring energy, and to be viable we need a minimum number of aircraft. For that, we need absolutely to build around France and Germany, but also potentially in the next step, why not have Spain, or Canada, or others, join?”

While Germany’s P-3C mission system enhancement project has been abandoned, a rewinging contract placed with Lockheed and Airbus in July 2015 will continue. The European company has already completed work on two aircraft at its Manching site near Munich.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991888403892517}",neutral,0.9991888403892517,0
airBaltic Defers Airbus A220 Deliveries | AirlineGeeks.com - AirlineGeeks.com,"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA4LzI0L2FpcmJhbHRpYy1kZWZlcnMtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Aircraft Orders and Deliveries ] By Bulent Imat

Latvian airline airBaltic announced on Thursday that they had agreed with Airbus to take delivery of 28 A220-300s by early 2024.

In mid-April, the airline’s outstanding Airbus A220 orders were postponed to 2023. With the new agreement, airBaltic gained an extra year to implement its fleet plans in the wake of novel coronavirus pandemic.

“The recent crisis enabled us to push forward our decision to introduce an Airbus A220-300 single type fleet. It allows us to minimize complexity and benefit from the additional efficiency provided by the aircraft. We will continue our growth and add more capacity provided by additional jets in the future as outlined by the Destination 2025 CLEAN business plan,” said Martin Gauss, CEO of airBaltic.

The Riga-based airline is the launch customer for the model and currently operates a total of 22 A220-300s. In early 2014, airBaltic will operate a single type fleet with 50 A220-300 aircraft. The airline also holds options for an additional 30 aircraft of the same type. With the delivery of three more aircraft, airBaltic is slated to operate 25 of this model by the end of 2020.

airBaltic to Operate All A220-300 Fleet

This year, airBaltic prematurely phased out its Boeing 737-300 fleet and twelve Bombardier Q400 turboprops three years earlier than planned retirement schedule in a bid to operate all A220-300 fleet.

“We are the only airline in the world that operates the A220 exclusively. At the same time, this gives us the youngest fleet in the world with an average age of just 1.9 years. And the aircraft’s price will fall even further because we are getting more planes,” Gauss said in an exclusive interview with aero.de in Riga.

The airline showed its confidence in the aircraft by stating that the 145-seat airliner performed beyond the company’s expectations in terms of fuel efficiency and convenience for passengers and the staff.

“This aircraft offers an excellent flying experience with such benefits for passengers as wider seats, larger windows, more hand luggage space in the cabin, improved lavatories and much more,” said the airline in a press release.

In the current climate when the travel demand collapsed, airBaltic believes that it is in a strong position as the model can be operated both on long haul and short-haul routes.

airBaltic suspended operations on March 17 due to the coronavirus outbreak and resumed flights on May 18. In July, the airline carried 251% more passengers than the previous month from the three Baltic capitals —Riga, Latvia; Tallinn, Estonia and Vilnius, Lithuania — to various European hubs and popular leisure destinations.

The class action was filed by shareholder Andrew Kornecki in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. It was filed on behalf of all persons and entities except the defendants, who purchased Airbus securities in the US.

Airbus chief executive officer Guillaume Faury and predecessor, Tom Enders, as well as chief financial officer Dominik Asam and predecessor, Harald Wilhelm, are included among the defendants.

The shareholders alleged that defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business, operational, and compliance policies between 24 February 2016 and 30 July.

The class action seeks to recover damages caused by defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws.



In 2016, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in Airbus Group’s civil aviation business.

The SFO reached a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the company on 31 January this year.

Airbus agreed to pay a €991m fine, comprising a disgorgement of profits and costs in the UK, and €3.6bn in total as part of the global bribery resolution involving French and the US authorities.

The DPA is in force until 31 January 2023.

Last month, the company revealed plans to eliminate nearly 15,000 jobs before mid-next year as part of the company’s strategy to adapt its global workforce and resize its commercial aircraft activity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8173853754997253}",neutral,0.8173853754997253,0

Before the coronavirus pandemic, the airline had planned to reduce its Airbus A340-600 fleet down to 10 aircraft this year, five by 2022, and then retire all of them by 2025.

However, the Spanish flag carrier brought forward the retirement after the aviation industry was hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

Iberia’s last Airbus A340-600 registered EC-JLE operated its last scheduled flight on 1st August from Quito to Madrid with 296 passengers and a crew headed by Captain Víctor Alegre Ramírez.

The Airbus A340-300 was the first four-engined Airbus aircraft operated by Iberia, entering service in 1996. The Airbus A340-600 joined the Iberia fleet in 2003, offering even longer flights with more passengers.

Iberia’s A340 made history in 1993, breaking the record for the longest commercial flight from Le Bourget in France to Auckland. The flight lasted for 21 hours and 31 minutes.

Pedro Sanchez's Government submits to Airbus - Atalayar EN,"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0YWxheWFyLmNvbS9lbi9hcnRpY3Vsby9zb2NpZXR5L3BlZHJvLXNhbmNoZXpzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc3VibWl0cy1haXJidXMvMjAyMDA4MDMwOTMyNDcxNDY4ODYuaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0YWxheWFyLmNvbS9lbi9hcnRpY3Vsby9zb2NpZXR5L3BlZHJvLXNhbmNoZXpzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtc3VibWl0cy1haXJidXMvMjAyMDA4MDMwOTMyNDcxNDY4ODYuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spanish President Pedro Sanchez and his coalition government do not want something similar to, or even worse than, what happened to Nissan and Alcoa a few weeks ago with the powerful Airbus, the European Union's leading aerospace and defence industrial corporation.

The executive has reacted to the announcement of the dismissal of more than 1,600 employees in Spain by the European multinational, in an attempt to preserve the strategic capabilities of the national industry, and has had no choice but to bend to the dictates of Airbus in order to reduce the impact of the decline in aerospace production which, in our country, affects a total workforce of more than 13,000 people in the company's nine Spanish locations.

It is one of the few alternatives left to the ministerial team chaired by Pedro Sanchez to avoid social unrest in the Airbus factories in Madrid, Toledo, Albacete, Cadiz and Seville, as well as those that were triggered a few months ago in Catalonia, following the closure of the three facilities of the Japanese car company Nissan. And those that were unleashed after the closure of the two Galician headquarters of Alcoa, the North American multinational aluminium company, closures that in total have led to the loss of 3,500 direct jobs and have left many thousands more in a critical situation.

After more than a month of regular meetings and negotiations between a Spanish inter-ministerial team and Airbus' senior management, the chief executive of the European industrial corporation Airbus, Guillaume Faury, has managed to get three ministers and the Spanish Prime Minister himself, Pedro Sánchez, seated at the same table to try and ""what about me"" and seal a short, medium and long-term agreement.

There is a reason why Airbus leads in Europe the design, development and production of commercial and military airplanes and helicopters, as well as satellites, and competes directly with the big American corporations Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. In Spain, its turnover in 2019 amounted to 13,000 million euros, so the government considers Airbus a driving force behind the rest of the national activity.

Involved but absent ministers

The conclave where the white smoke was produced took place on 30 July at the seat of the Presidency of the Government, in the Moncloa Palace in Madrid, and brought together President Pedro Sánchez and his Ministers of Defence, Margarita Robles; Industry, Trade and Tourism, Reyes Maroto and the Minister of Science and Innovation, Pedro Duque.

They were joined by the Director of the Department of National Security of the Office of the President of the Government, General Miguel Ángel Ballesteros, who is responsible for the President's advisory body on National Security matters, accompanied by executives with knowledge of aerospace matters.

It is curious that, given the content of the meeting, neither the Minister of Finance, Maria Jesus Montero, nor the Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, were present. Perhaps it is that Moncloa considered that President Pedro Sánchez and five of his ministers were already too many to sit in front of Guillaume Faury, the Frenchman who has been in charge of Airbus for 19 months.​​​​​​​

In essence, the Spanish Government's commitment covers five major packages of measures and concessions. These range from direct financial aid to the multinational and its chain of suppliers and to the airlines that fly Airbus aircraft, to advance payments to finance the subsequent delivery to the Ministry of Defence of already contracted weapons systems, such as the A400M military transport aircraft and the NH90 helicopter.

It also includes confirmation of Spain's participation in ongoing international weapons programmes, such as the future Tiger Mk III combat helicopter or the EuroMale, an ambitious project led by Germany with the participation of France, Italy and Spain to develop and manufacture a long-range military drone with large observation capabilities. And, of course, Airbus could not leave aside to assure the Spanish presence in the financing of the following phases of the Future Air Combat System, better known as FCAS.

More than 70 planes and helicopters

But what has a greater specific weight is what has been agreed in the area of defence, where the Spanish government has committed itself to setting up new programmes for the acquisition of military aircraft and helicopters. In this aspect, the joint communiqué uses in some cases a cryptic language, which makes it difficult for ordinary citizens to understand.

For example, it speaks of ""the transformation of three A330s into multi-purpose MRTT refuelling aircraft"". Firstly, the Air Force does not have any Airbus A330s, so it can hardly transform them. What is not explained is that Moncloa commits the Ministry of Defence to acquire from Airbus three large four-engine commercial A330 aircraft to convert them into the military version MRTT, a refuelling aircraft for in-flight projection of personnel and cargo to distant operation theatres.

The acquisition of four C295 aircraft in their maritime patrol version, for surveillance missions at sea, is also confirmed. These aircraft are manufactured in Getafe (Madrid) and Seville. This is a priority for the Air Force, whose Plans Division has placed it among its most urgent needs, to renew its outdated fleet of 8 CASA Nurtario CN235 VIGMA aircraft, an aircraft of Spanish origin that is no longer in production.

This includes the purchase from Airbus of no less than 36 twin-engine H135 helicopters - a number that can be increased to 59 - under the procedure of a joint programme between the Ministries of Defence and the Interior. The H135 is a model of aircraft that is widely used in the police field and is used by the Army for advanced flight training and by the Military Emergency Unit (MEU) for the transfer of relief and casualty teams.

The Government is also committed to activating a Ministry of the Interior programme to acquire four Airbus H160 twin-turbine helicopters for the Guardia Civil and the National Police over the next six years, an aircraft that has just been certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency and is expected to be certified by its US equivalent, the Federal Aviation Administration, shortly.

Airbus' commitments

Everything agreed was in different project phases within the General Directorate of Armament and Material of the Ministry of Defence. What Airbus has done is, on the one hand, to accelerate the progress of the programmes. And, on the other hand, much more important, to make sure that the decision of the team of Minister Margarita Robles and the new Secretary of State for Defence, Esperanza Casteleiro, favours a solution that clearly and directly favours the multinational, of which the Spanish State is a founding partner.​​​​​​​

The concessions made by the Spanish Executive are not made in time, with a few exceptions. One of them is the implementation of the so-called Aeronautical Technology Plan, which is linked to the European Union's Recovery Funds and has a budget of 185 million euros. It will be managed by the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI), which is why the Ministers of Science and Industry, Pedro Duque and Reyes Maroto, are present. The commitment is to determine its budget allocation for the period 2020-2023. It is detailed that in the present year it will be endowed with 25 million, in 2021 with 40, in 2022 it will be 80 and in 2023 with 40 million euros.

The agreements do not end there. The Executive assumes that ""other measures"" will be added to the previous amounts, which are not specified, as well as ""partially reimbursable aid"" valued at more than 50 million euros per year, to finance projects aimed at maintaining and strengthening the current capabilities of the aeronautical and defense sector in Spain and prepare the next generation of sustainable energy technologies and zero emissions.

And just in case something was missing, Madrid includes a whole range of initiatives that go from increasing export subsidies, its support for Airbus to get the United States to remove the tariffs it has imposed on large non-US civil aircraft, and contributions in the order of 15 million euros per year during 2020-2025 for innovation processes. Not satisfied with the above, the Government adds the creation of a Supply Chain Support Fund endowed with a minimum of 100 million, to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the sector and to increase the participation of the Spanish branch of Airbus in national space programmes and the European Space Agency (ESA).

But what is the counterpart on the part of Airbus? While on the government side the commitment in many cases is very defined in terms of dates and economic amounts, what the European multinational offers in return is more ambiguous and, at the same time, easier to implement.

Include Spanish senior managers

For example, one of the Spanish demands that has been included in the bilateral agreement is to create a mechanism for dialogue and information between the two parties, to meet at least once a year, a request that the Madrid government has been calling for for many years with the executives in Berlin and Paris. Another is that Airbus' subsidiaries in Spain should maintain - not increase, but maintain - their responsibilities in the development and manufacture of structures for current and future Airbus commercial aircraft, especially in composite materials technologies, which are led by the factory in Illescas (Toledo).

Another aspect that, 50 years after the creation of Airbus, it seems incredible that it has not yet been established in Spain is the adoption of a security and defence agreement that, like those that Airbus already has with France and Germany, will make it possible to safeguard the interests of the Spanish State.

And of course, minimising the impact on the loss of jobs in Spain and seeking solutions for plants with a lower workload, the most important thing for the government and the social peace it hopes to obtain at all costs ... and cost. According to official Airbus data released on 30 July, its losses in the first half of 2020 amounted to 1.9 billion euros, and 166 of its aircraft in service with different airlines - and 462 from Boeing - are pending a return to flight due to the COVID-19 crisis.

In the field of helicopters, whose Spanish factory is located in Albacete - of which Guillaume Faury was its supreme head, having been between 2013 and 2018, the CEO of Airbus Helicopters - the multinational is considering implementing a logistics interconnection centre to promote the creation of an Aeronautical and Logistics Park in that city. This includes the transfer of design authority for the rear fuselages of all Airbus helicopters, a measure of great importance.

As a curiosity. Absolutely nothing has been agreed upon regarding the interest repeatedly expressed by successive Spanish governments to increase their stake in Airbus, which through SEPI is 4.1%, while those of the Paris and Berlin governments are around 11%. In contrast, it is envisaged that Spain has an expectation of achieving a balanced and proportional participation in senior management positions, but this is not the result of any commitment on the part of Airbus. At present, its Executive Committee is made up of a dozen senior managers, mostly French and German, some British and Italian, but no Spaniards. It is to be hoped, however, that, as a sign of goodwill, Guillaume Faury will make this wish come true in the near future, a measure that will cost the corporation nothing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9513310790061951}",neutral,0.9513310790061951,0

What's happening to Boeing and Airbus? - Finshots,"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZmluc2hvdHMuaW4vYXJjaGl2ZS93aGF0cy1oYXBwZW5pbmctdG8tYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In today's Finshots, we talk about the global aircraft manufacturing industry.

Business

The Story

The data is clear. There are 91% fewer airline passengers this time around when compared to the same time last year. Globally, airlines are burning hundreds of millions of dollars daily, and experts have predicted that it’ll take the industry roughly 2–5 years to recover completely. And as airlines clamp down on their expansion plans, it’s bad news for aircraft suppliers as well.

As late as February this year, Boeing and Airbus were convinced they would be supplying 40,000+ aircraft worth roughly $7 trillion over the next 20 years. But if recent events are anything to go by, that outlook isn’t tenable anymore. Boeing received order for just one new aircraft in June. Airbus got none. And the single order Boeing received wasn’t even for a passenger plane. It was a cargo aircraft.

This sad figure highlights a harsh reality — there’s not much that aircraft makers can do when their customers are struggling for survival. Except, cut costs, of course.

Together, Boeing and Airbus are planning to cull some 35,000 jobs in the coming months. They are also cutting investments in research. And although they are ramping down production by more than a third, they can’t exactly stop manufacturing airplanes completely.

The problem can be attributed to the complex supply chain supporting the industry. Some of these suppliers are large conglomerates that include the likes of Rolls-Royce and General electric. They’ll tide over the crisis one way or another. However, you also have small firms that supply critical components in modest volumes. These companies usually work with a few dozen employees and very limited resources. And when Boeing and Airbus trim their order book, these manufacturers will also have to bear the burden. And if some of these suppliers do in fact shut shop, finding alternatives can be extremely challenging.

Also, this isn’t just limited to some obscure manufacturer halfway across the world. Indian companies including the likes of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Aequs and Dynamatic have also been impacted. HAL produces doors for Airbus’ A320 aircraft and flaperons for the Boeing 777 aircraft. Aequs delivers titanium machined parts to some of these players and Dynamatic supplies airframe structures and aerospace components.

It’s pretty bad.

But that’s not all. Airbus and Boeing also have to deal with another problem. Oftentimes, new airplanes are ordered years ahead of delivery. This makes the whole purchase journey rather unpredictable since an airline carrier could be committing to a large order during a travel boom and receiving delivery whilst battling a crisis As Bloomberg puts it.

This risks creating a dynamic that pits the plane makers against ailing carriers, as they try to get them to honor contracts and accept jets they can’t afford and don’t need. If they don’t press carriers to pay for at least some of the planes ordered during flush times, then the airframe manufacturers will have to burn more cash to keep their operations humming. But if they push too hard, they could further hobble some customers financially — endangering future sales or even driving them toward bankruptcy, jeopardizing existing contracts.

And as you can imagine, things don’t always go according to plan. Consider what happened to Boeing at the end of March. According to FT, the manufacturer was ready to hand over a brand new 787 Dreamliner to an important customer in the Middle East, when the customer threatened to call the deal off — unless Boeing offered another discount on top of the 55% discount that it had already offered on the $338 million aircraft.

Now, normally, this kind of behaviour would be unacceptable. Failing to honour the contract would have cost the customer a cool $100 million. But accepting the delivery at the quoted price would have probably cost more. Finally, however, Boeing ended up slashing the price by another 15% and they somehow managed to get the aircraft off their books even if it meant losing good money.

In fact, between April and June this year, Boeing burned through $5.6 billion in cash, while Airbus lost $5.2 billion. And unless air travel comes back with a vengeance, things aren’t going to look much better anytime soon.

Until then…

It is the first time that this model airplane visits an airport in Ecuador.

Through a statement released by the airline, Iberia explained that these flights are operated in compliance with the regulations established by both Ecuador and Spain, and following all the prevention and hygiene measures of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Spanish Agency Aviation Safety (AESA) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures can be found on the company's website: https://www.iberia.com/ec/es/covid-19/medidas-adoptadas/

Andrew O’Brian, president and CEO of Corporación Quiport, the company that manages and operates the Quito airport, stressed the importance of starting this operation for the city. “The A350 is the most modern aircraft currently operating commercial flights. It offers a number of advantages in terms of fuel consumption that makes the operation more efficient and friendlier to the environment. In terms of service, the aircraft is ideal for intercontinental flights and offers a high-quality product for our passengers who can enjoy a more pleasant flight. I congratulate Iberia on this milestone in our joint operation,” commented Mr. O’Brian.

""Starting yesterday, the Spanish airline operates with its modern Airbus A350 the three weekly flights that it has scheduled between Quito and Madrid, that it will offer on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays during the month of August,"" the statement said.

High technology at the service of the client and the environment

According to the information rovided by Iberia, the Airbus A350 offers great improvements over the A340/600 fleet, which it replaces, both in the customer experience and in its operation, which is much more sustainable. These aircraft have a configuration of 348 seats: 31 in Business class, 24 in its new Premium Economy cabin and 293 in Economy class.

A currentless ventilation system with ozone filters renews the air inside the aircraft every two to three minutes, which contributes to its purity and improves the cabin humidity level by between 11 and 16 percent.

The windows are panoramic and the lighting is with LED lights. In addition, the materials with which this aircraft is built, added to the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines Iberia has equipped its Airbus A350-900 with, make it the quietest on the market.

It is a twin-engine aircraft, which has a range of 14,800 km, and consumes 25 percent less fuel than other models of similar capacity, which also represents a 25 percent reduction in CO2 emissions.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9331680536270142}",positive,0.9331680536270142,1
German Air Force takes delivery of first Airbus A350 VIP transport aircraft - Defense Brief,"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjAvMDgvMjAvZ2VybWFuLWFpci1mb3JjZS10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM1MC12aXAtdHJhbnNwb3J0LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The German defense ministry has taken delivery of the first of three A350-900 VIP transport aircraft that will be operated by the country’s Special Air Mission Wing.

The aircraft was delivered on August 20 and will be commissioned into the German Air Force this fall.

Delivered by Airbus under a contract from 2019, the aircraft will bear the military registration 10+03. The other two units, with military registrations 10+01 and 10+02, are scheduled for delivery in 2022.

Germany received the aircraft after it underwent a cabin conversion at Lufthansa Technik AG, where it received a special transitional cabin for the transport of representatives of the Federal government and their accompanying delegations.

The transitional cabin is tailored to the specific requirements of the customer. It will be equipped with office and conference areas, adjoined to a multifunctional lounge area. The rest of the cabin space will be available to the accompanying delegations.

Only after the sister aircraft 10+01 and 10+02, which are currently still under construction, receive a fully featured VIP cabin from Lufthansa Technik next year, the transitional cabin in 10+03 will also be exchanged for one.

According to Airbus, the A350 XWB is the first Airbus aircraft to feature a carbonfiber fuselage and wings, which are immune to fatigue and corrosion, as well as saving weight.

The ACJ350-900 XWB can fly 25 passengers 11,100 nm/20,550 km or more than 22 hours in its ultra-long range version.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",neutral,0.9999969005584717,0
