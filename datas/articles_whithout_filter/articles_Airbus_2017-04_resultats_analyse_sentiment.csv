"Airbus Engineering boosts innovation, competitiveness with move to WSU Innovation Campus; relaunches Airbus ... - Airbus","Thu, 27 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNC1haXJidXMtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctYm9vc3RzLWlubm92YXRpb24tY29tcGV0aXRpdmVuZXNzLXdpdGgtbW92ZS10b9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ribbon cutting ceremony for the Airbus Americas Engineering Center in Wichita, Kansas was held on April 27, 2017. The event also commemorated the 15th anniversary of the center.

Airbus Americas Engineering today officially opened its new Engineering Center on the Wichita State University (WSU) Innovation Campus. In a ceremony attended by the approximately 300 Airbus employees who work at the center and special guests, including Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, the company recognized the importance of locating academia and industry together to improve innovation and competitiveness. The company also relaunched the Airbus Foundation Flying Challenge in Wichita, which will see Maize USD 266’s Maize High School and Maize South High School junior and senior students building an airplane in partnership with Airbus and Tango Flight.“Airbus employees are creative people,” said Barry Eccleston, CEO of Airbus Americas, Inc. “As they develop engineering solutions they naturally discover new ideas and concepts that could potentially enhance products and business processes to create value for our customers. The question is, ‘how do we support our employees as they transition good ideas into value?’ Our presence on the Innovation Campus will help us do that. The campus provides an environment that fosters faster transition of innovative ideas into real-world uses and value for the company.”Being a resident on the campus provides a support infrastructure to Airbus Engineering that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to duplicate in a stand-alone engineering center, including access to engineering labs, research faculty, conference facilities, educational opportunities, and easier collaboration with other members of the Innovation Campus.As a resident of the campus, Airbus is partnering with WSU within the university’s Applied Learning Model, which engages students in real-world engineering projects, helps develop critical skills that are needed for engineering now and in the future, and helps produce graduates with experience, while also boosting Airbus’ competitiveness.“Wichita’s talent pool of aerospace and aviation experts is among the richest in the world,” said John O’Leary, Vice President-Airbus Americas Engineering. “The aviation expertise here is recognized within Airbus and around the world. The Innovation Campus is only going to help Wichita’s expertise grow. And with the relaunch of the Airbus Foundation Flying Challenge in partnership with Tango Flight and Maize Schools, we’re investing in the future of that expertise.”The Airbus Foundation Flying Challenge is a global program that leverages aviation to inspire young people to continue their education, find their professional vocation and realize their dreams through mentoring with Airbus employee volunteers.The program initially launched in Wichita in 2012 with a focus on middle school students. The 2017 challenge will focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at the high school level through the construction of a flying aircraft. The program will build on the existing Aerospace Engineering curriculum at Maize USD 266, which incorporates Project Lead The Way (PLTW) in its curriculm. Airbus mentors will work with students to build an FAA Licensed RV-12 “kit plane”. The students will be exposed to aircraft design, engineering and production activities, as well as project management, team work and finally, the freedom of flight.“Partnerships and opportunities like these are key as we continue to create ways to introduce our students to experiences, skills, mentors, and potential jobs that will help their college readiness and future careers take flight,” Maize USD 266 Superintendent Dr. Chad Higgns said. “We welcome mutually beneficial relationships with businesses and other organizations that strengthen our students’ learning environment while enriching the community.”Tango Flight will provide the Airbus Foundation with a unique turnkey solution including an integrated aerospace engineering curriculum, aviation training, aircraft ownership, aircraft insurance and mentor program development. “We are very excited to work in partnership with Airbus and Maize High to expand this Program to the Air Capitol,” said Dan Weyant President and Co-Founder of Tango Flight.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9768713116645813}",positive,0.9768713116645813,1

All of that makes Toulouse the natural home one of France's best aviation temples, the Aeroscopia Aeronautical Museum, (Musée Aeroscopia Aéronautique). Opened in 2015 and located near Airbus's A380 factory and Toulouse's airport, Aeroscopia tells the story of Airbus and puts a wide variety of historic and modern aircraft on display.

Of course, Airbus isn't doing this to please the weirdly chatty flyers of the world, to say nothing of the suffering, silent majority. The European planemaker doesn't sell to passengers, after all, it sells to airlines. Airlines, it figures, that would be delighted to collect money from four score more people on each flight.

The capacity bump combines a variety of manufacturing modifications that Airbus calls, in a feat of marketing speak, ""cabin enablers."" Some of these techniques are classic moves (adding seats to rows), though Airbus announced other, more novel alterations, like reconfigured stairways, at this week's Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany.

Airbus D&S could lose out on satellite deal if UK seeks competition - Defense News,"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvc3BhY2Utc3ltcG9zaXVtLzIwMTcvMDQvMTgvYWlyYnVzLWQtcy1jb3VsZC1sb3NlLW91dC1vbi1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZGVhbC1pZi11ay1zZWVrcy1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The British Ministry of Defence is close to a decision on whether the country buys a new military communications satellite from incumbent supplier Airbus Defence and Space or opens the requirement up to competition, according to executives familiar with the program.



MoD officials at Joint Forces Command responsible for Britain's military satellite communications capability have been prevaricating over whether to go single source and buy the spacecraft, known as Skynet 6A, from Airbus or throw the procurement open to rival bids from Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space.



While the MoD has remained rather mum, several industry executives reckon there could be a decision within a week or two, although they say it's unclear what impact the Conservative government's decision to hold a snap general election on June 8 may have on the timing of any announcement.



Shaping UK military space industry



By itself, a one-satellite requirement is no big deal, but where the contract ends up could have implications for the future industrial base and military space procurement options here.



All four satellite companies responded to an MoD questionnaire last year, and British officials have visited company satellite facilities in the U.S. and Europe to assess security, the ability to meet sovereignty and U.K. industrial base requirements, and other issues ahead of making the decision.



The satellite is planned to fill a possible capacity gap as early satellites in the Skynet 5 constellation currently used by the military approach the end of their lives ahead of a new generation of communications capabilities becoming available toward the end of the next decade.



Four Skynet 5 satellites supply the British military with communications capacity as part of a ground-breaking private finance initiative deal in 2002, which saw Airbus provide the spacecraft, buy ground terminals and operate the ground stations in a 20-year, £3.6 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) agreement with the MoD.



The first three satellites were launched in 2007 and 2008, and the final spacecraft — Skynet 5D — was launched at the end of 2012.



Up until last year, the satellite communications requirement was known as the future beyond line-of-sight, or FBLOS, program.



Now it has been renamed Skynet 6 and packaged into three elements: a stop-gap spacecraft, a service delivery package to manage ground operations and an enduring capability program to provide future communication system capacity beyond the end of the next decade.



All the packages will eventually be contracted by industry starting with the 6A satellite.



Capability rollout



The service delivery element needs to be in place by 2022 when the Airbus private finance initiative deal expires and the Skynet 5 satellites and ground stations are handed back to the MoD for a pound.



""The current intention is that a service package will be required to be in place six to 12 months before the Skynet 5 PFI expires in August 2022,"" according to the MoD.



The final part of the Skynet 6 requirement will be the introduction of a future enduring communications capability, which will partly be provided by satellites; however, other innovative systems, like Airbus-built Zephyr solar powered unmanned aircraft, which fly on the edge of space, may also be in the mix.



The British military has already ordered three Zephyrs for evaluation.



The MoD didn't respond to a question about the timing for the introduction of an enduring capability beyond Skynet6A, but the expectation is that systems will start being rolled out around 2028 or 2029.





The competition dilemma



There have been dissenting voices in the MoD on which route to follow, according to one executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""Some thought there should be a competition, and some believed there was no credible competition [to Airbus] given the sovereignty requirements, be that based on issues like where the satellite is built, jobs in the U.K. or much more esoteric definitions of sovereignty, which allow you freedom to do what you want with the spacecraft once you have bought it,"" he said.

Richard Franklin, the head of the Airbus secure communications business, said the company was committed to support the MoD’s decision either way.

But, he reckons: ""A single-source award would save substantial procurement costs for the MoD and support an earlier launch date if required.""

Nik Smith, Lockheed Martin’s U.K. lead for military space, said his company would welcome the chance to demonstrate its capabilities.

""We think competition is the right way to move forward the capability and other value for money reasons,"" Smith said. ""If the MoD believe[s] they have good justification to sole source Skynet 6A, we want to seek reassurance that the follow-on elements of the program will be competed. That’s important for a number of reasons from building industrial base through to delivering the right capability to the war fighter.""

LUCKY! Flying Aer Lingus Business Class on an Airbus A330 - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNy8wNC9sdWNreS1mbHlpbmctYWVyLWxpbmd1cy1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1haXJidXMtYTMzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To say a lot has changed at Aer Lingus since I last flew the airline in 2014 would be an understatement. The airline’s fleet has grown, new destinations have been added, new products introduced, and ownership has transferred to IAG, the parent group of British Airways. On a recent work trip between New York JFK and Berlin, I had a chance to try out the new Aer Lingus business class product, which is now fully rolled out to every long-haul aircraft in the fleet. Yes, even the 757s.

My trip started at JetBlue’s Terminal 5 at JFK, where Aer Lingus is one of just two other airlines that share the terminal with JetBlue. For whatever reason, Aer Lingus is incapable of issuing mobile boarding passes on flights to and from the United States, so I had a chance to visit the dedicated business class check-in desks. Staffed by friendly JetBlue employees, I was quickly checked-in and on my way to the relatively new Aer Lingus lounge.

I last visited this lounge while it was still under construction in 2014 as a part of the larger T5i expansion. The lounge is small, but really only handles one flight at a time, so it should never fill to capacity. The lounge offers a self-pour bar, snacks, and ample power outlets conveniently near comfortable tables. Just outside the windows sits the iconic TWA Flight Center, which is currently being preserved as a hotel.

Also on offer in the lounge is a pre-flight dining service, which I felt was a tad on the weak side. The flight to Dublin is short, barely cracking five hours. If you want to have any chance of sleeping on this short red-eye flight, eating before flying is essential. IAG sister airline British Airways, over in Terminal 7, fully realizes this and offers a fantastic dinner service, but Aer Lingus’ buffet-style service was anemic and in need of improvement.

At boarding, I was greeted by smiling flight attendants, which seemed to be a theme for the crew on my Aer Lingus flights. Like all other long-haul aircraft in the Aer Lingus fleet, this Airbus A330 featured the airline’s new business class product, which very closely resembles JetBlue’s Mint product. Aside from some color changes, the seat is nearly identical. Almost all passengers have direct aisle access, but three passengers will have to settle for being locked in against the window. Still, though, this configuration is better than most.

%CODE1%

After settling in with a glass of bubbly in hand, I checked out the already activated entertainment system, which works gate-to-gate. The screen is a decent size, but I found the viewing angle to be a bit problematic. The screen itself can’t be adjusted in any way, so from certain angles it appeared washed out. The content was a bit on the weak side as well. The system listed 43 movies available, but many of those options were actually shorts, bringing the true number of movies offered way down. That is ok for shorter flights, but those flying between San Francisco and Dublin may reach the end of the catalog quickly. Noise cancelling headphones were a nice touch.

If you do get bored with the entertainment system, Aer Lingus offers reasonably fast Panasonic Ku-band Wi-Fi on all A330s. It is also one of the few airlines in the world to offer WiFi as a free perk to business class passengers. I can’t state enough how much I love this. Business class passengers shouldn’t be nickled and dimed, so including WiFi is something all airlines should do for premium passengers.

Aer Lingus distributes vouchers providing 400MB, which should be plenty for normal people. I somehow managed to use nearly the whole allotment on the redeye, but 400MB is 400MB more than 99% of other airlines give its passengers. Full flight WiFi is available to economy passengers for $18.95.

After (unsuccessfully) trying to get a few hours of sleep, we arrived at Dublin well before 5:00 am local time. Like a confused zombie, I shuffled over to the Aer Lingus lounge for a shower before my connecting flight, but found the doors locked and a line of a few passengers waiting to get in.

The lounge opens at 5:15 am, which sounds very early, but not when the first transatlantic flights start arriving at about 4:30 am. The doors eventually opened and I was able to take a quick shower and grab a small bite to eat. This lounge doesn’t offer much in the way of food, but with a body clock indicating just barely after midnight, I was ok with that. The shower was more than enough to keep me going.

Flash forward a few days and my business in Berlin was wrapping up’¦.just as a complete strike at Berlin’s airports were ramping up. I knew my flight out of Berlin would be cancelled the next day, so I took action before that officially happened. I contacted Aer Lingus on Twitter to have my departure city switched from Berlin to Hamburg, hopped on the ICE train and rebooked my hotel. In my opinion, Aer Lingus waited a bit too long to officially cancel its Berlin flights, and I feel that had I waited for official word before acting that I would have been stranded an extra day. It always pays to be proactive.

Dublin is one of very few airports offering customs and immigration pre-clearance for US-bound flights. As someone with Global Entry, pre-clearance is actually a burden rather than a perk. Thankfully, Dublin Airport recently opened a new lounge in the pre-clear side, which I liken to more of a holding pen than a gate hold area. The 51st&Green US Preclearance lounge is an oasis and significantly improves the passenger experience at Dublin. The food and beverage options aren’t huge, but the views more than make up for it. Aer Lingus claims this lounge is the closest to an active taxiway and runway anywhere in the world, and they’re probably right. The views at 51st&Green are amazing for any #AvGeek.

The flight back to New York was operated by a brand-new A330, less than a year old. On this flight, I was able to enjoy the full and proper meal service. From start to finish, the flight attendants never let my glass run empty. The menu offered a choice of pan-seared cod, chicken fricassee, or a fillet of Irish beef. I opted for the beef, which was served with spinach, horseradish jus, and potatoes dauphinoise. The meal, including appetizer and dessert, was divine. The service was outstanding.

Aer Lingus often clocks in as one of the less expensive transatlantic business class options, yet is somehow able to provide a better in-flight experience than its competitors, even within its own parent group. Any issues that I encountered along the way are easily solvable, giving Aer Lingus a top notch product. As IAG looks to update the British Airways product and continually evolves its other divisions such as Level and Iberia, it should look to the Irish for inspiration.

(Editor’s Note: An Economy fare was paid for by the reviewer’s business, but the upgrade to business class was provided by Aer Lingus for the purpose of this review. All opinions are those of the author)

Design decision: Airbus employees put a smile on the BelugaXL's “face” - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA0LWRlc2lnbi1kZWNpc2lvbi1haXJidXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXB1dC1hLXNtaWxlLW9uLXRoZS1iZWx1Z2F4bHMtZmFjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The BelugaXL’s special livery design – including beluga whale-inspired eyes and a happy grin – was voted on by Airbus employees

Smile, it’s often said, and the world smiles with you. If true, the world will soon find itself grinning ear to ear, but it still won’t match the BelugaXL’s supersized expression of joy.With the first of five next-generation oversize cargo airlifters slated to enter service in 2019, Airbus asked its employees to select how the A330 Family-based BelugaXL should appear to the world. “The six designs we proposed for consideration by employees respected our brand identity while running from the conventional to the unconventional, even adding a touch of fun,” explained Tim Orr, Airbus’ Head of Branding.Garnering more than 40 per cent of the employees’ vote, the “Smiling BelugaXL” entry – complete with beluga whale-inspired eyes and a happy grin easily won this competition.With its bulging upper forward fuselage and enormous cargo area (one of the most voluminous of any aircraft in existence, civil or military), Airbus’ BelugaXL will be plenty recognisable as it is. The addition of a happy face to the distinctly-shaped airframe that gave rise to the iconic aircraft’s name will further reinforce it in the public’s mind and help further develop Airbus’ identity.“It is amazing how our BelugaXL airlifters foster such enthusiasm,” said Bertrand George, Head of the BelugaXL programme. “I’m extremely proud of working on such an important symbol of our company, and I’m sure my team feels the same about this exciting project. I’m already looking forward to seeing our first BelugaXL emerging from the paint shop and greeting the world with a big smile on its face.”Airbus’ Beluga fleet is used to transport complete sections of the company’s aircraft among production sites around Europe and to final assembly lines in France, Germany and Spain.Built as a replacement for the five current Beluga A300-600ST versions that entered service beginning in 1996 (based on the A300-600 jetliner), the BelugaXLs are derived from the larger and more powerful A330-200, sized at six metres longer, one metre wider, and boasting a payload lifting capacity that is six tonnes greater than their predecessors. As an example of its increased payload capabilities, a BelugaXL will be able to carry two wings for the new widebody A350 XWB instead of a single wing currently accommodated on the BelugaST.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996423721313477}",neutral,0.9996423721313477,0

Boeing and Airbus Debut New Airliners With First Flights on the Same Day - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMjU5MjEvYm9laW5ncy03ODctMTAtYWlyYnVzLWEzMTluZW8tZmlzdC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The maiden flights for both the Boeing 787-10 and the Airbus A319neo were carried out Friday, March 31. The two airplanes are the newest members of the 787 family for Boeing and the A320neo family for Airbus.

The two aircraft manufacturers both cite efficiency as their primary reason for building the new planes, but these two jets take radically different approaches. The 787-10 is the longest of the 787 family, holding 40 more passengers or 15 percent more cargo than the 787-9, while the A319neo is the smallest jet in the A320neo family and relies on the new CFM International LEAP-1A engines to achieve efficient flight.

Airbus

Boeing's two-aisle 787-10 will fly transoceanic and other long-distance flights. The Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer has secured 149 orders for the twin-engine jet from nine airlines around the world. The longer fuselage and composite airframe are meant to improve fuel efficiency per seat, with capacity for up to 330 passengers.

The stretched fuselage does come with the cost of a shorter overall range, however. The 787-10 will have a range of about 7,400 miles compared to 8,800 miles for the 787-9 and the 8,450 miles that the 787-8 can fly. This means Boeing's newest jet airliner will be able to comfortably hop between Europe and the United States, Europa and Asia, and Asia and North America, but it won't quite have the legs for flights between Australia and the Americas.

The single-aisle Airbus A319neo will be capable of trans-Atlantic flights, but will primarily be used for shorter routes more suited to its range of about 4,300 miles—roughly 60 miles more than the other A320neo variants. The A319neo will have capacity for just 124 passengers compared to the 150 that can fly on an A320neo and 185 for an A321neo. Airbus plans to retain fuel efficiency in the A320neo family by leveraging new, high-efficiency engines and taking advantage of aerodynamic airframe designs.

The 787-10 flew for just under six hours over Boeing's South Carolina facilities, where the 787-10 will be manufactured, as the pilots tested flight controls, handling qualities and other systems on the aircraft. The A319neo flew from Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport in Germany to Toulouse, France, staying aloft for five hours as the pilots tested the craft.

Boeings first 787-10s will be delivered sometime in the first half of 2018 to launch customers Singapore Airlines, British Airways, and United Airlines, among others. Airbus has yet to announce a launch customer for the A319neo, and only about 55 planes have been ordered thus far.

With a new long-haul airliner from Boeing and a new narrow-body jet from Airbus, these two aviation giants continue to duke it out for control of the skies.

New ways of cabin definition for A320 and A330 customers

The extension of Airbus' Customer Definition Centre (CDC) in Hamburg, Germany – shown in this computer rendering – will serve customers of the A320 and A330 jetliners

- Airbus in Hamburg has launched the extension of its Customer Definition Centre (CDC) which will serve customers for A320 and A330 aircraft. Thus far, since its operations began in 2014, the CDC has been the ‘product showroom’ exclusively for A350 XWB customers. Following this extension launch, construction will soon begin in earnest to enlarge the existing CDC premises by redeveloping and equipping a large adjacent aircraft hangar into a state-of-the-art and cooperative working environment. When fully completed in approx. two years, the new facility will encompass approximately 4,500 sq m of additional space over two floors dedicated for A320 and A330 customers, and will foster the realisation of their integrated cabin solutions.“By extending the CDC to include the A320 and A330 Families, we are further enhancing the valued services we can offer our customers,” says Didier Evrard, EVP of Programmes at Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “Customers are able to define their aircraft interior and give us feedback on innovations. At the same time Airbus can harmonise the cabin definition process to improve efficiency for the airlines, Airbus and its cabin suppliers.”In the CDC, customers are offered a purposely designed array of highly dedicated zones: functional ‘play rooms’ for cabin equipment testing; inspiring exhibition areas for product staging; a well-fitted design studio with adjacent lighting mock-ups for material selection and lighting definition; and innovation areas. Moreover, with an integrated use of virtual reality technology complemented by configurable customer-specific mock-ups, all these assets available under one roof make the CDC a unique and attractive one-stop-shop for cabin customisation.Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services.

Fifty years after its maiden flight on April 7, 1967, the Gazelle is still being operated by nearly 100 customers in 34 countries and it is appreciated for its ease of maintenance and high reliability.

Developed and manufactured in cooperation with the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s, more than 1,250 Gazelles have been delivered. Today, 470 rotorcraft — more than a third of all Gazelles manufactured – are still in service, 100 of which are operated by the French army.

A helicopter of many “firsts”, the Gazelle was the first Airbus helicopter to be equipped with the Fenestron, which is still present on Airbus’ light and medium rotorcraft, including the first of the H generation, the H160. This major innovation improves safety around the tail rotor on the ground and reduces the sound level of the rotorcraft.

It was also the first Airbus helicopter to be equipped with glass-resin blades developed in cooperation with the German company Bölkow. Lastly, it was the first helicopter in the world to be awarded the instrument flight rules (IFR) qualification, category I, by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), allowing operators to fly to IFR with a single pilot on board.

On May 15, 1971, the Gazelle broke three speed records in its category:

Over three kilometers: 310 kilometers per hour;

15/25 km: 312 km/h; and

Over 100 km in a closed circuit: 296 km/h.

The Gazelle was a major success in the military sector and nearly 80 percent of the rotorcraft in service are used by armies around the world. By the end of December 2016, the Gazelle fleet had accumulated more than seven million flight hours. The Gazelles (SA341 and SA342) that have accumulated the most flight hours (14,200 and 13,100, respectively) are currently operating in the United States.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999510049819946}",neutral,0.9999510049819946,0

Airbus also rewarded for its cooperation in other winning projects improving passenger comfort

Airbus won the Crystal Cabin Award in two categories at Aircraft Interiors Expo 2017. The winning projects are the ”ReTrolley” in the Greener Cabin, Health, Safety and Environment category, and the ”Smart Cabin Reconfiguration” in the Passenger Comfort Hardware category

Airbus has won two categories in this year’s Crystal Cabin Award for the first time. The winning projects are the ‘ReTrolley’ in the Greener Cabin, Health, Safety and Environment category, and the ‘Smart Cabin Reconfiguration’ in the Passenger Comfort Hardware category. Airbus received two additional awards for partnering in the ‘Smart Onboard Wheelchair’ in the University category and the ‘Octaspring Lightweight Seat Cushion’ in the Material & Components category.“Winning several categories at the aviation’s ‘Oscars’ shows that we are constantly pushing the latest in innovative cabin design solutions,” said Ingo Wuggetzer, Vice President Airbus Cabin Marketing. “This means we stay true to our Airspace principles, delivering comfort and benefits to both passengers and airlines.”Charles Champion, Executive Vice President Engineering, added: “The awards also demonstrate that we strive with our partners to continuously innovate for our customers and passengers worldwide. I am proud of the teams that have worked really hard and I congratulate them on their well-deserved success.”ReTrolley separates waste as it is collected in the aisle, reducing its volume by up to 30% through manual compression. This saves space in the galley and increases the share of recyclable waste as airlines are looking for new and simple solutions that reduce the cabin’s ecological footprint. Only separated recyclable waste can actually be recycled. The ReTrolley solution is based on a concept first designed by students of the University of São Paulo and later advanced by Airbus Innovations experts. As part of the Airbus BizLab Accelerator programme, the concept was validated with airlines last year using a demonstrator.At least three seats remain unoccupied on many flights. Now, passengers can benefit from it. The Smart Cabin Reconfiguration project frees up space in A320 Family cabins without much effort. It uses movable seats designed in cooperation with seat manufacturer Recaro. Selected rail-mounted seat rows, designed in cooperation with THK, enable cabin crew to adjust seat pitch based on flight reservation data – within turnaround time. A member of the cabin crew can fold away one seat row and then quickly move those in front of it just like a car seat. Passengers in these seats benefit from more legroom.For passengers with limited mobility, independence on board an aircraft is highly desirable. This is made possible with the Smart Onboard Wheelchair which the passenger can roll over the toilet seat unassisted. Structural changes to the aircraft lavatory are not required. The wheelchair was designed by students of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences supported by Airbus experts. The project was tested by wheelchair users. Their verdict: easy to handle, stable, and safe.Cabin comfort is one of the top priorities for passengers and designers constantly seek to maximise it. In cooperation with Studio Moderna, Boxmark, and Stelia, Airbus has found a way to enhance seat comfort and save weight at the same time. The breathable Octaspring seat cushion featuring coil springs made of foam uses different levels of density to optimally distribute the passenger's body weight over the entire seat.

"Airbus revisits A380 3-5-3 economy, adds ""around 80 seats"" - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 11 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDQvYWlyYnVzLXJldmlzaXRzLWEzODAtMy01LTMtZWNvbm9teS1hZGRzLWFyb3VuZC04MC1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Airbus seeks to revitalise sales of its flagship A380, the company is continuing to develop new “Cabin Enabler” options for densifying the aircraft, unveiling new options for the front and rear staircase.

Together with four other previously discussed offerings, the changes are set to raise the passenger count on the aircraft by “around 80 seats with the same comfort level versus current deliveries”. Yet Airbus is still pushing the eleven-abreast, 3-5-3 economy densification option on airlines — though quietly, at its partner seatmaker Geven’s booth at the recent Aircraft Interiors Expo, and without the most controversial part of the configuration: the window seat. Indeed, a survey on the seats asks airlines to rate aisle width without the presence of an actual aisle.

Some — but certainly not all — of Airbus’ “Cabin Enablers” are passenger experience neutral. No airline uses the A380’s large staircases for a significant part of passengers’ journey, so there is no real detriment to swapping them out. Indeed, reclaiming space at the front of the cabin may enable new options for airlines to make further innovations in the passenger experience, whether that space is used for first, business, premium economy or regular economy class flyers.

Other cabin enablers are very much not passenger experience neutral, despite Airbus claim that it is “freeing more cabin floor space for no compromise on comfort level”. The idea of adding a seat in every economy row was received with opprobrium at almost every corner at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in 2015, and despite the return of eleven-abreast, there were no full-size A380 cabin seating mockups available to view on the Airbus stand.

Instead, just the centre five seats were on show at a single seatmaker, Geven. Notably, in 2015 there had been two seatmakers offering 3-5-3 options on Airbus’ behalf, but only one was on show in 2017. And while both Airbus vice president for cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer and Geven’s managing director Alberto Veneruso suggested that there had been improvements — including on the way that the centre seats were fixed to the cabin floor — details on how these were purported to have resolved the passenger experience issues from two years ago were not forthcoming.

Clipboards containing a survey titled “11-abreast Economy Class Seat Validation” were placed on the Geven stand’s centre section mockup, asking for comments on:

“Overall how do you rate the 11-abreast Economy Class seat concept?”, rating in five categories from very good, rather good, neutral, rather poor and very poor The same ratings for seat width, aisle width (despite there being no aisle), recline, cushioning, headrest, seat table, and foot space “Do you see any obstacles, which prevent you from integrating this 11-abreast seat concept into your aircraft in the future?” with an open comment section for the “yes” box. “Would you be interested to integrate this 11-abreast seat concept in your aircraft cabin?, with options “yes, linefit only”, “yes, line- and retrofit”, and “no” “Do you have any improvement suggestions or additional comments?”

Premium economy passengers, meanwhile, will not welcome the change from a 2-4-2 layout to 3-3-3, since one of the key benefits of previous premium economy cabins has been the reduced number of middle seats and absence of the “double-hop” for window seat passengers to stretch their legs.

The current benefits of the densification moves include a 23-seat gain from an 11-abreast economy class, although it is unclear why this is just 23 seats, since most A380 operators have more than 23 rows of economy on the main deck and the increase should be a full seat per row.

A new rear stair option — combinable with a new galley module or standalone — finds a further 14 seats, while a new forward stair (removing the signature sweeping staircase of the A380) adds approximately 20 seats to the total. The forward stair is relocated from doors 1 to doors 2, and combines the stairway from the main deck to the upper deck with the stairway from the main deck to the lower deck crew rest.

Removing upper deck sidewalls (6 seats), adding a combined crew rest (3 seats), and moving to a nine-abreast premium economy cabin (11 seats) round out the options list.

These options, of course, only add up to 77 seats, but the variance would appear to down to the specific cabin requirements selected by the airframer’s airline customers. Airbus places in a careful footnote the information that its “around 80 seats” relies on the fact that “497 passengers is the airline’s average capacity of the A380s currently in operation today – which are consistently attracting above-average passenger load factors.

With all these A380 cabin enablers, the A380 seat count would move from 497 to 575 in four classes, and generate significantly more revenue for airlines” — but at what cost to Airbus’ long-touted “I Fly A380” passenger experience reputational premium?

Airbus delivers first ever A321neo to Virgin America - Airbus,"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNC1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtZXZlci1hMzIxbmVvLXRvLXZpcmdpbi1hbWVyaWNh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Aircraft powered by CFM engines boosts fuel efficiency by at least 15 percent

Significant reductions in emissions and noise

Airbus has delivered the first-ever A321neo. The latest generation aircraft powered by CFM International’s LEAP-1A engines was handed over to U.S. airline Virgin America, an all-Airbus operator, at a ceremony in Hamburg, Germany.

“After Virgin America having been the first customer signing for the A320neo back in December 2010, we are today delighted to deliver the first A321neo to them,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President Commercial Aircraft. “With our largest, latest, most fuel efficient NEO Single Aisle aircraft we are turning a new page. The new A321neo powered by next generation CFM LEAP-1A engines guarantees new levels of efficiency and longer range to its operators, greater comfort to the flying public and less emissions and noise to the airport communities. Thanks to its cutting edge technologies it is today the most eco-sensitive Single Aisle aircraft available.”



The A320neo significantly reduces noise levels, generating only half the noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft. Equipped with fuel-saving Sharklet wingtip devices nitrous oxide emissions are 50 percent below regulatory requirements as outlined by the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP). In addition, the aircraft with LEAP-1A engines is proven to deliver at least a 15 percent fuel savings compared to Virgin America’s current generation aircraft, which is equivalent to cutting 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions with each plane every year.“

We have been with Virgin America from the beginning and we are excited to launch this new chapter in that relationship,” said Gael Meheust, President and CEO of CFM International. “The LEAP-1A has done extremely well in its first months of commercial service. It is proving unprecedented levels of fuel efficiency and environmental responsibility while maintaining the level of reliability Virgin America has come to expect from CFM. We think they will be very pleased with all this engine has to offer.”

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo Family. It covers the entire market, from high density to long-range thin routes. There are currently over 1,300 units on order. “We are honored to be the first operator of this high in-demand aircraft,” said Virgin America President Peter Hunt, speaking at the ceremony attended by Virgin America teammates, Executives from Airbus, CFM and the aircraft lessor GECAS. “The new A321neo – the third member of the Airbus A320 Family to join our Virgin America fleet – will allow us to further reduce our unit costs and enable us to further reduce our carbon emissions.”

“Increased operational efficiency, productivity, and state-of-the-art technology -- this winning combination makes the A321neo an attractive investment for leasing companies like GECAS who are committed to meeting customers’ operational needs while providing the latest technology and a solid return on investment,” said Alec Burger, President and CEO at GECAS. “The low operating costs and reliability of the LEAP powered A320neo Family make it a strong asset in GECAS’ portfolio.”

Virgin America currently operates a fleet of 63 Airbus A320 family aircraft comprised of A319ceo and A320ceo aircraft powered by CFM’s CFM56-5B engines. The new A321neo will become the largest aircraft in Virgin America’s fleet, featuring 185 seats - a 24 percent higher capacity at same comfort levels than its current A320s. Inside the cabin, Virgin America flyers will continue to enjoy three custom-designed classes of service, touch-screen personal entertainment and an on-demand food and cocktail menu on every flight in addition to power outlets at every seat.

The aircraft is expected to enter service on May 31, 2017 with its inaugural flight from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). As first announced in April 2016, Virgin America was acquired by Alaska Air Group in December 2016.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9734064936637878}",positive,0.9734064936637878,1

How is AI Changing the Aviation Industry? - AI Business,"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYWlidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vdmVydGljYWxzL2hvdy1pcy1haS1jaGFuZ2luZy10aGUtYXZpYXRpb24taW5kdXN0cnkt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We recently secured an interview with Tomas Sanchez Lopez, Head of Data Analysis and Interaction at Airbus, aiming to understand how they are currently implementing artificial intelligence, specifically in the aviation sector, and how they plan to do so in the future.

[caption id=""attachment_7414"" align=""alignleft"" width=""232""] Tomas Sanchez Lopez, Head of Data Analysis and Interaction at Airbus[/caption]

As the Head of Data Analysis and Interaction at Airbus, Tomas Sanchez Lopez manages the Data Analysis and Interaction team, located within the Operational Intelligence department and the Data Driven Technologies Innovation Centre, at Airbus Group Innovations.

Therefore, he'll naturally be very familiar with how the company is currently using and plans to adopt artificial intelligence in the future. We spoke to Mr. Sanchez Lopez, who'll be a keynote speaker at the AI Summit in London (May 9th and 10th), with the overall goal to understand more about how Airbus is deploying AI in its business strategy and how they intent to do so moving forward.

AI taking off

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services, therefore we were interested in learning how they are currently using AI. ""Airbus is a large organisation with over 135K employees and circa €65 billion annual revenue, operating at 180 locations worldwide,"" began Sanchez Lopez.

""We are interested in applying Data Science techniques to gain insight from data, focusing on Machine Learning and Visualisation, and targeting particular use cases within the organisation,"" he explained.

Sanchez Lopez went on to detail precisely how Airbus is currently using AI. ""We are working with our colleagues at Airbus commercial aircraft to analyse data coming from various factories, looking at predicting when variations in the manufacturing processes occur, so assembly problems can be tackled earlier, when is easier and less costly, or even prevented completely.""

Yet, they are also using this new technology in other areas. ""Another very different example is what we are doing with Open Source Big Data, where we are using social media and other online data to understand passenger experience,"" he highlighted. ""Insight into what our end users feel and think about travelling, not just during their time in the aircraft but also throughout the overall journey, could prove valuable to develop and market our products, as well as assisting our airline customer in positioning their services.""

The conversation swiftly moved on to which industries does Sanchez Lopez believe Airbus is gaining most traction from in relation to AI. ""Airbus is obviously an aerospace company,"" he started, ""but we have many more products than most people realise."" Airbus' Head of Data Analysis and Interaction detailed how AI is used to boost the aeronautics sector. ""Airbus commercial aircraft is of course the largest and most well know business unit, and AI can help in many different ways; from the optimisation of manufacturing processes (as part of Industrial IoT, Digital Thread and Digital Twin initiatives), to smart maintenance, flight operations optimisation, training or even virtual assistants for pilots and crew.""

Sanchez Lopez even spoke of how AI is applied to their helicopters and even Airbus' aerospace and defence sectors. ""Similar ideas can of course be applied to Airbus’ helicopter division. Airbus Defence and Space, however, brings other opportunities to the table, such as greater automation of border surveillance operations or the monitoring of human welfare through biosensors, such as astronauts or officers,"" he stated.

Furthermore, Airbus is additionally gaining traction from AI in the autonomous cars sector. ""Something else that is clearly gaining traction is the use of autonomous vehicles, and this is by no means exclusive to the aerospace sector. Urban mobility initiatives such as Vahana or Pop Up have been publicised recently, but AI can clearly help in the further automation of existing products such as Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) platforms.""

Behind-the-scenes of AI

The conversation subsequently moved onto which areas of business does Sanchez Lopez see AI having the biggest effect. ""Machine learning and particularly Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning are gaining increasing popularity as the new paradigm to approach automation in vehicles, and car manufacturers are embracing these and other AI technologies for their products,"" he answered.

""In general, however, it is obvious that Human Machine Interaction is where AI was ‘born’, so to speak, and it is a field where more and more developments will occur. This is also the area that most people associate AI with i.e. intelligent systems that can communicate with humans in a natural way, and that are embodied many times through the use of robotics, but that are increasingly present through virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa or Google Now,"" he expanded.

""I think that these technologies will likely enhance existing products rather than creating new ones, and this is something we are seeing in platform like smart phones or vehicles, and increasingly in virtual assistants like recommendation engines (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, etc).""

He finished off by claiming that the real advancements in AI will be made behind-the-scenes. ""I think that the largest use of AI technologies is happening, and will continue happening, in the background, where businesses use them to gain insight from their operations and their customers,"" he divulged.

""Some people might argue that Data Analytics and Business Intelligence technologies are not part of AI, but I disagree for the most part: data intake, filtering, wrangling and machine learning are definitely part of the any AI pipeline, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data,"" he concluded.

How about Airbus' competitors? We asked Sanchez Lopez whether he could tell us what sets them apart from other aeronautics companies who are also using AI. ""Airbus is in a strong position to take advantage of AI technologies for a number of reasons,"" he started. ""Firstly, it has access to unimaginable amounts of data, not only produced by the platforms it manufactures, but also by the manufacturing processes themselves.""

""Data, as we all know, is the fuel of the AI revolution, because the algorithms that empower this intelligence are trained with vast amounts of existing examples of how the ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ outcomes look like for a particular situation,"" explained Sanchez Lopez.

""Secondly, Airbus has the risk taking ability to try out new developments in AI in its own products. Thirdly, Airbus has the right mind set to try out new ideas using AI, together with other core technologies to the company, for developing new products and services. Airbus spends over 2 billion euros per year in research, and almost half of that is for the development of disruptive ideas within the Chief Technology Office,"" he detailed.

""Finally, Airbus has a tremendous wealth of engineers and experts built up through decades of innovation in aerospace, and such vast know-how and domain knowledge is something very difficult to replicate for our competitors,"" finished Airbus' Head of Data Analysis and Interaction.

Will the future see AI soaring to new heights?

However, even though many companies are talking about adopting the new technology, it's no simple matter. So we asked Sanchez Lopez whether he could outline the biggest challenges for businesses looking to adopt AI. ""I think that we should differentiate between businesses using AI to gain insight into their operations and users, and businesses using AI to create new products or as the basis of their value proposition,"" he expressed.

""For the former, many medium to large companies have already heard about AI technologies and are creating new teams looking at Data Science. Perhaps the biggest challenge for them is to understand what AI can do for them, since sometimes it seems that this investment is not based on an identified exiting need (which doesn’t mean that there is no need), but more on the idea that if everybody is doing it, they should do it as well,"" offered Sanchez Lopez.

""For the latter, perhaps the biggest challenge is to capitalise the investment i.e. how does the value proposition transform into revenue? For example, it is great that you have raised capital to develop a drone delivering goods in urban areas, but is this a viable business model given the current air space regulations and customer’s appetite? I suppose both of these cases could be summarised as one, and applies equally as a general rule to any new technology: You should only do it if it makes sense, and not just because you can do it,"" he concluded.

We finished off our conversation with Mr. Sanchez Lopez by asking him to predict where Airbus will be in five years' time in relation to the adoption of AI, and he started by claiming that, ""Airbus’ journey into using AI has just started."" He continued, ""Airbus holds an incredible wealth of data that can be used to improve and streamline its manufacturing processes and operations, and I can imagine that perfecting these will continue for many years to come.""

""At the same time, Airbus will most likely continue exploring how to incorporate AI in existing products and services, not only to develop the next generation of aircraft but also the add value to existing offerings. Airbus is also looking into the future in terms of new offerings that will use AI, be it in the form of urban air mobility or through the development of new data-based services,"" he finished.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999573230743408}",neutral,0.9999573230743408,0

The Secret Codes Behind Every Airbus Plane Name - Yahoo Life,"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2VjcmV0LWNvZGVzLWJlaGluZC1ldmVyeS1haXJidXMtMjEwNTE0NDgwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Although it may seem like the letters and numbers assigned to aircraft are completely arbitrary, there is actually a fine-tuned system behind the naming. Airbus, for example, has a pretty rigid code by which they name their planes.

The very first Airbus ever made was the A300. In this case, the “A” stood for Airbus and 300 was the original capacity. After some time, Airbus realized that the plane would be better with only 260 passengers (instead of 300). However, rather than rename the plane the A260, they decided to go with A300B.

Related: How Airlines Around the World Name Their Airplanes

After that, Airbus decided to continue with their system and started naming their planes by multiples of 10 — A310, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380. (The company decided to skip A360 and A370 in case they ever wanted to go back and create planes that are somewhere in between the A350 and the A380 in terms of size.)

When Airbus decides to tweak a plane just a bit, they will stick to numbers close by. For example, the shorter variants of the A320, A318, and A319.

But these four letters and numbers are only part of the aircraft’s name. A full, proper Airbus name would be, for example, the Airbus A320-231. This plane belongs to the A320 family, and the last three digits specify the plane even more.

The first digit means that it was part of the Airbus A320-200 series — the second version of this plane. The last digits correspond to the type of engine used. (A full list of engine codes is available here.)

For those who are curious: Boeing’s system of naming airplanes is a bit more complicated. The numbering process is laid out here.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999808073043823}",neutral,0.9999808073043823,0

Airbus is redesigning the world's biggest passenger plane to cram more people inside - Quartz,"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzk0OTY1Mi9haXJidXMtaXMtc2hyaW5raW5nLXRoZS1zdGFpcmNhc2VzLW9uLXdvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1wbGFuZS10by1jcmFtLW1vcmUtcGVvcGxlLWluc2lkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Designers have managed to fit bars, lounges, and showers aboard the double-decker Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger plane. Now, the plane’s manufacturer says the wide staircase that connects its decks should go.

Today, Airbus unveiled a new, narrower design for its front staircase, creating space for 20 more seats on the plane. Each plane can carry 497 passengers currently, according to Airbus.

The new design is one among a number of ways that Airbus is offering to fit up to 80 additional customers in the plane. Other changes include changing a spiral staircase at the back of the plane and removing some cabin stowage space.

It’s Airbus’s attempt to make the planes more economically attractive to airlines that have eschewed the four-engine plane in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. But fitting more passengers aboard may not prove a selling point.

Last year, Airbus said it would cut production of the Airbus A380, after demand dropped for the superjumbo airplane. The A380 giant passenger load means that airlines have to fly to hub cities before passengers make connections to their final destinations on smaller planes. It can be more efficient for airlines to instead use smaller planes and fly passengers nonstop to more destinations.

It is too early to tell whether airlines will want to buy more of these tough-to-fill planes, or if passengers will want to fly in a more crowded cabin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9967727065086365}",neutral,0.9967727065086365,0
"Recaro, Airbus promise flexibility with reconfigurable economy pitch - Runway Girl Network","Sat, 15 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDQvcmVjYXJvLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9taXNlLWZsZXhpYmlsaXR5LXdpdGgtcmVjb25maWd1cmFibGUtZWNvbm9teS1waXRjaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airlines interested in varying the amount of extra-legroom economy seating they can offer on an aircraft have a new option with the Smart Cabin Reconfiguration movable seat product developed by Recaro, Airbus and THK. The name might not roll off the tongue — so much so that your author at the Aircraft Interiors Expo nicknamed it it “Seaty McSeatface” to distinguish it from other reconfiguration and flexibility products on offer — but the product, where one row of economy folds up to redistribute its pitch among others, is fascinating.

Fresh from success at the Crystal Cabin Awards, Recaro CEO Mark Hiller sat down with Runway Girl Network on the final day of the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2017 to dive deep into the response and answer questions about for this reconfigurable product.

“We had tremendous feedback and response regarding the concept. What we need to do for sure is reevaluate and put all of the feedback together,” Hiller says, noting that airline “interests are somehow also different. Some are thinking about their economy class to implement it there, some are thinking about doing it for maybe their premium economy class or even for single aisle business class.”

In terms of implementation, Hiller notes, “the concept needs to be worked out individually with every airline: how they want to manage it, and how they want to handle it. When would they go for such a configuration between the flights and at what phase? Is it a free upgrade? Is it something for frequent flyers, or is it really anciillary revenue?”

While Recaro and Airbus were demonstrating the system with the final seat in a section being the one to move, Hiller confirmed to RGN that instead the first seat in a section could be flexible instead, opening up opportunities for cabin space differentiation.

“The setup that we’ve shown is really to [show that] if you have more space then you can move them backwards, but for sure you can move in both directions. But another topic which might be of interest is regarding power and electricity in the seat, and that is also something that needs to be defined: how to route the cables to have the flexibility.”

Questions raised about the location of oxygen masks and the passenger service unit (PSU) vents, lights and other services, however, have already been considered in the system’s design.

“That’s part of the concept already,” Hiller says, “and the movement of the seats is within the flexibility of the PSU, of the light, and so on if the light comes on. So that’s also one reason why not all of the seats in the cabin will be moveable. Otherwise it would be completely out of the different possibilities of seating positions… they are moved within the tolerance.”

European airlines with flexibly sized business class cabins often face pushback from crew on changing the location of curtains and flipping up centre tables already. British Airways’ width-convertible seating, for example, required a specialised winch, whereas the Smart Cabin Reconfiguration system is lift-seats-and-pull-lever simple.

An immediate question — indeed, one that RGN raised when we saw the system on Recaro’s stand the night before AIX opened — is around whether this simplicity provides enough protection from passengers deciding to allocate themselves an additional few inches of pitch.

“That’s a very funny story,” Hiller says with a smile, “because I always challenge our engineers that we are always over engineering and doing very complicated German solutions. And then the feedback on the show was it’s too simple, which is first of all for my benefit a very good compliment! It’s a very simple solution for a challenge.”

“But it will be easy” to fix, Heller expects. “Either use it with a tool, or block the seat and then you can just open it up with a specific tool. This will be easy to arrange. But besides that, to change it and to move the seat, all three passengers would need to stand up. So there’s also a natural barrier. But then also the airline needs to work out in detail: would they prefer to have a special tool? Would they prefer to have a very discrete ledge?”

At this stage, the options seem open. But one aspect that Hiller was keen to shut down was any suggestion that a product from Bishop GmbH means there are intellectual property questions for Recaro to resolve.

First, let’s listen to Bishop GmbH’s Peter Bishop describe his concept in 2011 at the Paris Air Show.

Hiller highlights, “First of all it’s a cooperation with Airbus. More or less, our focus is on the seat and the Airbus focus is on the cabin and also the seat tracks. And regarding the seats, there are several things where we are applying for patents: mechanisms and so on.”

So, RGN asked Hiller, you’re confident there will be no legal issues, no requirement to pay royalties, or so on?

“I’m not aware of any royalty, whatever, or any other issue,” Hiller says.

Hiller also clarifies that, while he wasn’t aware of the details of Bishop’s concept, “more or less the focus of Airbus is everything that belongs to the aircraft directly, like the seat track. And our focus is the seat and the mechanism: how to unlock it, how to move it, how to flip up the seat.”

“Besides that,” Hiller explains, “I think the reconfiguration of an aircraft, this is not a new topic. But I think the solution is new. Because it’s simple and you can adjust it in just a minute. But you see here, the old, see the orange one?”

Hiller points to the vintage, retro-orange Recaro 7410 convertible seat, with its movable centre armrests, on display at Recaro’s stand. “It was all about cabin reconfiguration. You see the 3530 seat down there with a seat blocking device for the middle seat, you can sell it as a domestic business class. Also a concept about reconfigeration of the cabin. So I guess there will be seats to come — I would say more concepts to come in the future, which support reconfiguration.”

The key to success may well be the multiple factors in the purchasing decision for the product: while there are several (often competing) use case desires for reconfiguration, together they may edge an airline over the line toward selecting the system.

HAECO and Airbus solve emergency kit stowage problem - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDQvaGFlY28tc29sdmVzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1raXQtc3Rvd2FnZS1wcm9ibGVtLXdpdGgtb3ZlcmhlYWQtYWlzbGUtYmlucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and interiors manufacturer HAECO are offering a new solution to the problem of emergency equipment, crew bags and other non-passenger items taking up overhead bin space with the Centerline Ceiling Stowage compartment, an un-snappily monikered storage option that is much more exciting from a passenger experience perspective than its name suggests.

Worldwide, the crunch on overhead space for passengers’ cabin bags is getting more problematic for airlines. In several regions, particularly the United States, this is driven by the amount passengers bring on board, while storage for crew bags, emergency equipment, inflight entertainment systems, and other items not required to be accessed in-flight compound the problem.

For business and first class passengers in particular, where one or even two rows of overhead storage may be taken up with airline equipment, not having anywhere to stow their bags is a reasonable complaint. One of the reasons passengers pay for a premium fare — either with cash, miles or as part of their loyalty perks — is to not have to hang around the gate area waiting for the Pamplona-esque running of the frequent traveller bulls down the airbridge once the agents start boarding.

The centerline ceiling stowage (CCS) compartment comes in two sizes — regular and large — to accommodate a range of equipment and baggage.

“The CCS is designed to hold crew luggage, onboard wheelchairs, life rafts and other emergency equipment, among other items. The compartment is offered in two sizes, and is available in two positions on the A320 and three positions on the A321. The ceiling compartment will be compatible with fixed and pivoting bins, and will also be available as a retrofit option through an Airbus service bulletin modification,” an Airbus and HAECO statement explains.

With careful, professional stowage, each compartment appears roughly equivalent in size and storage space to an Airbus A320 current-generation overhead bin.

“We’re extremely pleased and very fortunate to be selected by Airbus to provide this ceiling storage, which is something that is actually an idea that we presented a couple of Hamburg interior shows ago,” HAECO senior vice president of engineering and product development José Pevida tells RGN.

“We started to work with Airbus on this particular application on the Airbus 320 family of aircraft, and finally we’ve arrived to being awarded the linefit and retrofit program,” so we’re very pleased to have that,” Pevida says.

Pleasingly, both Recaro and Airbus are very much approaching the new bins as an opportunity not just for equipment that won’t be touched except in an emergency, but for a wider range of items.

“Really, the primary functionality for it is to create additional storage space so, very much, that storage can be used for emergency equipment, but it can also be for additional crew storage areas or some equipment that is currently occupying the overhead bin space — which we all know is at a high premium in the cabins,” Pevida says. “This is one of the solutions that allows, for example, portable oxygen equipment, first aid kits. That type of emergency equipment you may see normally in the bins can be moved to these areas and that frees up these areas for baggage.”

Of course, the system hasn’t been without its engineering challenges. Any time that an interiors supplier suggests fixing new storage options to the attachment points inside the cabin and fuselage, a significant amount of recertification and consequential engineering hurdles must be overcome.

“Some of the engineering challenges are your common challenges that we have to make it a lightweight product,” Pevida notes, “but there’s also the aesthetics of it to make sure that it properly blends with the rest of the ceiling lines so that it will fit within the cabin aesthetics.”

With an increasing number of interiors suppliers — and indeed airframers and airline customers — taking care to ensure that the overall design of the cabin works from the often competing perspectives of safety, functionality, and looks, the centerline ceiling stowage compartment is relatively unobtrusive and matches the rest of the cabin.

“The other thing is the ergonomics,” Pevida notes. “We do have several mechanisms in there that allow it to very smoothly transition from a stowed position into an open position, and we have things like hold-open devices so that the equipment or the items that are already stored in there can be taken in and out without having to hold the door open.”

Clearly, there are questions to be answered about how airlines and cabin crew use these storage areas. While HAECO has engineered them to be ergonomic, the crux will be around whether there is user (i.e., crew) friction compared with the previous normal option of just popping bags into the business class overhead bins.

But this kind of stowage is not entirely unprecedented in the airline arena. Your author recently flew on a Swiss Boeing 777-300ER and noticed a pull-down storage bin over the galley, which the cabin crew were using for stowage of their personal items to avoid needing to compete with passengers for space.

The supplier-furnished, linefit nature of the bins is also not to be overlooked. HAECO is giving the impression of a seatmaker and interiors supplier that would like to be even more involved with factory-fitted work despite also being one of the world’s most influential maintenance, repair and overhaul operations.

“HAECO Cabin Solutions’ selection as a supplier of SFE equipment to Airbus is a milestone for the Greensboro, North Carolina based company, which became part of the Hong Kong based HAECO Group following the 2014 acquisition of TIMCO Aerosystems,” the company says in a statement.

The airline claims that Airbus failed to advise that external forces could affect the flight path angle of the A320.

Although no one was killed in the accident, which occurred on March 29, the airport was left without power for several hours and twenty-three people were injured. According to an investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), the A320 severed power lines during approach, impacted the ground short of runway 05/23 and slid along the runway before stopping 570 metres beyond the threshold. No mechanical deficiencies were found during the post-crash investigation.

Air Canada's claim says that flight crew correctly configured the aircraft for approach and landing and thus the landing should have gone as planned. ""Instead, the aircraft descended at a steeper angle than expected and touched down short of the runway,"" the claim said.

Airbus Wants To Cram More People Into World's Biggest Passenger Plane - Scripps News,"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyaXBwc25ld3MuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJlZGVzaWduLWEzODAtdG8tZml0LW1vcmUtcGVvcGxlL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyaXBwc25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yaWVzL2FpcmJ1cy10by1yZWRlc2lnbi1hMzgwLXRvLWZpdC1tb3JlLXBlb3BsZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is trying to make the biggest passenger aircraft fit even more people — so if you like feeling like a sardine, this could be the travel option for you.

The Airbus A380 is a double-decker aircraft and holds an average of 497 passengers. The company wants to bump that number to 575.

To do that, it would remove a top deck stowage area, rearrange and combine staircases and move crew rest areas.

The A380 has been declining in popularity. The company cut production of the jumbo jet in 2016 because there's less demand for giant airliners.

Giant aircraft can really only land in hub cities. So if a passenger is heading somewhere that's not a metropolis, they'll probably have to switch to a smaller plane at some point.

So airlines are looking at smaller planes because they can land in more places and they're more fuel-efficient.

But not every company is thinking that way. Airbus believes the airline market is headed for bigger planes.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6386117339134216}",negative,0.6386117339134216,-1
First 3D printed hydraulic manifold successfully flies on Airbus A380 aircraft - VoxelMatters,"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveGVsbWF0dGVycy5jb20vZmlyc3QtM2QtcHJpbnRlZC1oeWRyYXVsaWMtbWFuaWZvbGQtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWZsaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveGVsbWF0dGVycy5jb20vZmlyc3QtM2QtcHJpbnRlZC1oeWRyYXVsaWMtbWFuaWZvbGQtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWZsaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stay up to date with everything that is happening in the wonderful world of AM via our LinkedIn community.

The road to 3D printed, safety-critical flying parts is a long and intricate one, however the benefits on the horizon are enough to justify years and years of man-hours in research and testing. Eventually, even the most complex projects reach a moment when they repay for all the efforts. The fully 3D printed hydraulic spoiler manifold that on March 30th flew on Airbus’ Number 1 A380 is one of those moments. Peter Sander, VP and Head of the Emerging Technologies & Concepts Germany – one of the key figures behind it – reveals what this means for AM and for the aerospace industry as whole in this exclusive interview.

Can you tell us more details about how this project began?

“The AM hydraulic manifold was first envisioned as far back as 2007, when German government funding enabled Chemnitz University of Technology and the LIEBHERR Group to begin working on it. In 2010 we reached the first milestone when it was established that it was actually possible to do it. That is when I was invited to participate.”

What does this component do exactly?

“The spoiler actuator is a safety-critical part. It is used to control the air break, or spoiler. It is a very complex part and the point is that – over the past seven years – we were able to design it, produce it and validate it to a stage where we are really allowed to fly with it. This is the very first time a hydraulic component flies on a commercial aircraft.”

What are the main benefits of the AM design?

“The final design has a Ti64 SLM 3D printed housing with elements that are directly screwed on. The first and primary benefit is that it is 35% lighter than the original part. Secondary benefits include the fact that we are able to reduce air resistance and thus optimize fuel-efficiency. Finally we were able to optimize the efficiency of the hydraulic systems. This results in less heat being generated, less noise and also lower hydraulic power requirements.”

Which are the next steps for this part’s evolution?

“Last year we began thinking about how to continue to evolve this project. We have now obtained a ‘clean-sheet design’ that is no longer a one-to-one exchangeable. The next step is to rethink completely the hydraulic systems fully integrating for examples pipes like in an electronic multy layer technology in order to simplify the complex assembly process. This will be the single biggest opportunity in the future.”

What will it take to see parts like this go into serial AM production?

“LIEBHERR is the Airbus Tier 1 supplier that delivered these units to airbus at the end of last year. The experts at LIEBHERR have explained that they already have several of these hydraulic components in mind and that they are working on the first tests. Their stated objective, now that we have the proof of concept is to establish an AM factory to work on serial production in the near future.”

Do you feel that AM for serial production is already a cost efficient approach?

“Yes and it has already been demonstrated by our fully owned subsidiary at Premium Aerotech. They launched last year and have already begun production of serial parts in their AM factory, delivering the first parts.”

Which are the biggest challenges you’ve had to overcome?

“The research and testing phase is of course extremely long. In order to validate a part up to a stage that you are able to fly it, a part like such as the manifold – even if it was produced by traditional manufacturing – has to be tested over 12 million cycles. This mean that our final product went on a test bench with all the parts screwed on and then completed 12 million movements for the spoiler. Then it was installed on our own A380 aircraft number one to fly on March 30th. On the following day it flew again and it is still installed.”

What about the other AM projects you have worked one, when will they be ready to go into production?

“We are working with authorities to validate our 2014 bionic cabin bracket for use in commercial aviation. The parts have been further topologically optimized and will be manufactured by Premium Aerotech by DED technology as serial products for the new A350. We have over 15 years of experience working with DED technology however now we are using it to build parts that are topologically optimized.”

Do you feel that recent advancements in software are fully supporting this evolution in manufacturing?

“Software has made some significant steps. In particular the new MyShape design tool recently introduced by Dassault Systemes for topology optimization is already fully available and we have begun retraining our first 100 engineers to implement it. Autodesk is also coming along with its project Dreamcatcher generative design project, which is not yet ready for implementation but promises to bring great benefits in terms of efficiency.”

What about AM hardware, are you satisfied by recent progress?

“I started in 2012 with SLM, Concept Laser and EOS at Laser Center North. All these systems has one 250 Watt laser. Since then machines have evolved in terms of size and number of lasers, almost doubling their capabilities year on year. Clearly every new machine needs to be understood and qualified and this is very complex, especially in terms of managing multiple lasers inside the build chamber. But the general trend is very good. Today there are some 200.000 industrial CNC mills sold yearly worldwide. If we can show that AM is more efficient, eventually a big part of those will become AM systems.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9549858570098877}",positive,0.9549858570098877,1
Airbus Shows Off A380 Model That Holds Even More Seats - The Points Guy,"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE3LzA0LzM4MC1tb2RlbC1tb3JlLXNlYXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 is the world's largest commercial jet, and has now been flying with airlines for ten years. If you've ever flown one, you know it's an incredible plane, not only for its size, but also in its passenger comfort.

The superjumbo, known as ""The Whalejet"" by aviation geeks, has brought on some of the most innovative and luxurious designs ever found on commercial planes. For example, Emirates was the first to install showers aboard its A380s for first-class passengers. Etihad installed a super-size suite, knows as The Residence, and most, if not all A380 operators have some form of walk-up lounge or bar for their premium passengers.

At this year's Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany, Airbus announced some conceptual design changes called ""cabin enablers"" that would allow carriers to fit up to 80 more seats inside the Whalejet. The biggest and most noticeable change would be the removal of the wide Grand Staircase at the very front of the cabin. The forward staircase would be moved farther back into the cabin and replaced by a more compact staircase like the one you'd find on a Boeing 747, where you walk up halfway, turn and then walk up the rest of the way.

Airbus is calling this version of the A380 ""NFS,"" for New Forward Stairs. Dr. Kiran Rao, EVP of Strategy and Marketing at Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said, ""Continuous improvement of our products is our daily work. This new package for our A380 customers is a smart way to meet airline needs while improving the A380 economics with additional revenues and innovating in passenger comfort.""

Dr. Rao added, ""Only the A380 has the economies of scale and development potential to efficiently solve the problem of increasing congestion at large airports while providing the best comfort for passengers. The aircraft can also serve fast growing markets and airlines regional airports, so we are adapting the aircraft to meet evolving market needs.""

Airbus is also offering 11-abreast seating in the economy section of the A380, in a 3-5-3 configuration. It has managed to keep the same 18 inch-wide seats by narrowing the aisles to 17 inches, and removing storage along the sidewalls of the aircraft. ""We stay with all of the same comfort elements that the A380 is proud of,"" said Ingo Wuggetzer, VP of Cabin Marketing. ""Greatest ambience, greatest space for business. All that is continued as we optimize monuments. We add about 25 square meters (269 square feet) of space of the aircraft that you can use for those additional seats.""

Airbus originally had grandiose plans for even larger A380 versions, but couldn't find enough airline customers to make the development cost worthwhile. Even the current version — the A380-800 — is struggling to find new orders. There are only 107 A380s left in Airbus' order backlog, and many think the program may be on its last legs. There just aren't many airlines who desire a four-engined high-capacity plane these days. Boeing has faced the same struggle with its venerable 747. The A380 is also limited by the number of airports that can accommodate a plane of such size.

The A380 can be found flying with many of the world's largest and best-known airlines, including Air France, British Airways, China Southern, Emirates, Etihad, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. No US-based airlines fly the A380. Emirates has by far the largest A380 fleet in the world, having taken delivery of 94 of the 210 delivered so far. Some of Emirates' A380s hold up to 615 passengers, with 557 economy seats and 58 business-class seats. The average A380 currently holds about 497 seats in a standard three-class configuration.

"One year on, investigators still trying to understand fatal Airbus H225 crash in Norway - Vertical Magazine","Fri, 28 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvb25lLXllYXItaW52ZXN0aWdhdG9ycy1zdGlsbC10cnlpbmctdW5kZXJzdGFuZC1mYXRhbC1haXJidXMtaDIyNS1jcmFzaC1ub3J3YXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One year after the fatal crash of an Airbus Helicopters H225 (EC225 LP Super Puma) operated by CHC near Turoy, Norway, investigators from the Accident Investigation Board of Norway (AIBN) are still trying to fathom why a crack initiated in the main rotor gearbox (MGB) and how it propagated.

In a preliminary report on the crash released today, investigators also raised questions about the certification process, as the failure mode “seems to differ from what was expected.”

The AIBN also confirmed “many similarities” with the MGB failure that led to the fatal crash of an Airbus Helicopters AS332 L2 (G-REDL) off the coast of Peterhead, Scotland, in 2009.

“The AIBN will continue the investigation into how and why two similar catastrophic accidents could happen to near identical helicopters only seven years apart,” the AIBN report states. “Further assessment of the followup on the G-REDL safety recommendations and the continuing airworthiness of the gearbox after 2009 is a relevant issue.”

The investigation has shown that the crash on April 29, 2016, which resulted in the deaths of all 13 people on board, was the result of a fatigue fracture in one of the eight second-stage planet gears in the epicyclic module of the MGB. The fatigue had its origin in the upper outer race of the bearing (inside of the gear), propagating towards the gear teeth. The crack initiation appears to be a surface micro-pit. However, the AIBN does not yet understand why the micro-pit formed and how and why the crack continued to grow sub-surface, thus preventing detection. No material conformity or manufacturing issues have been revealed during the investigation.

As previously revealed, the MGB had been involved in a road accident during transport in 2015, but the AIBN said it found no connection with the crack.

As to the similarity with the 2009 accident, the AIBN notes there was one warning of possible gear fracture in that case. Unfortunately, the actions taken did not recognize the degradation of the second-stage planet gear, which subsequently failed. It said there was no advance warning before last year’s crash.

The AIBN said it will continue metallurgical examinations and seek to understand the underlying driving mechanisms of the fatigue fracture. This includes studying the recently salvaged second-stage planet carrier with the inner race from the fractured planet gear. The investigators, however, say they cannot estimate a completion date for the final report.

In a statement reacting to the publication of the AIBN’s preliminary report, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it continues to provide its full support to the investigation. “EASA continues to implement robust and proven certification processes taking into account all available information,” the regulator added. “EASA proactively takes all necessary actions to mitigate identified possible contributory factors, in order to guarantee the safety of flights.”

Meanwhile, in a statement issued following the release of the report, Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said the company was not aware of any issue related to the 2009 crash at the time of the Turoy crash.

“The information available to us from the 2016 accident has allowed us to take protective measures that we could unfortunately not have put in place in 2009 based on the knowledge and evidence available at the time, and also because significant parts from the 2009 accident [aircraft] were never recovered,” he said.

“In the course of the investigation into the 2016 accident, we have implemented a set of protective measures which have been requested and validated by EASA. Nothing in this preliminary report alters this.”

Faury added that Airbus was “totally committed to transparency” in all matters regarding aviation safety and international helicopter regulations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9984824061393738}",neutral,0.9984824061393738,0

The hydraulic valve was developed in close collaboration with French aerospace manufacturer Airbus, and the Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany. The additive manufactured aerospace component has now been successfully trialled in a test flight of the double-decker A380 aircraft.

Improved design

The 3D printed valve block is used inside the actuator of an A380’s spoiler, activated when landing a plane to reduce aerodynamic lift. The 3D print is made from titanium and 35% lighter than the same part made through conventional milling. It is also composed of fewer parts, for a more compact and effective design.

Building on the success of the 3D printed spoiler actuator valve block, Liebherr has started work on a range of next generation hydraulic systems manufactured using additive technology. The next component in the pipeline is a 3D printed rudder actuator located in the tail of an aircraft.

The next generation of aircraft

In a statement from the company Heiko Lütjens, Managing Director & CTO Flight Control and Actuation Systems at Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation SAS, said,

We still have quite a way to go until we can introduce 3D printing technology on a broad scale in the aerospace industry. All parts of the process chain – from the powder material, over the laser parameters, the post processing, up to the final product – need to be optimized in order to improve stability, maturity, and economic efficiency. Nevertheless, the potential and vision of 3D printing will change the way future aircraft generations will be developed.

Also working towards the future, Airbus are exploring additive manufacturing for streamlined components in the upcoming A330neo and Beluga XL planes. In collaboration with Norsk Titanium, aerospace competitors Boeing has also approved its first 3D printed structural, titanium components for use in commercial flights.

Airbus is redesigning the world's biggest passenger plane to cram more people inside - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1yZWRlc2lnbmluZy13b3JsZC1iaWdnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci0xODEzMzM3NTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Designers have managed to fit bars, lounges, and showers aboard the double-decker Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger plane. Now, the plane’s manufacturer says the wide staircase that connects its decks should go.

Today, Airbus unveiled a new, narrower design for its front staircase, creating space for 20 more seats on the plane. Each plane can carry 497 passengers currently, according to Airbus.

The grand staircase.

The new design is one among a number of ways that Airbus is offering to fit up to 80 additional customers in the plane. Other changes include changing a spiral staircase at the back of the plane and removing some cabin stowage space.

It’s Airbus’s attempt to make the planes more economically attractive to airlines that have eschewed the four-engine plane in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. But fitting more passengers aboard may not prove a selling point.

The new design.

Last year, Airbus said it would cut production of the Airbus A380, after demand dropped for the superjumbo airplane. The A380 giant passenger load means that airlines have to fly to hub cities before passengers make connections to their final destinations on smaller planes. It can be more efficient for airlines to instead use smaller planes and fly passengers nonstop to more destinations.

It is too early to tell whether airlines will want to buy more of these tough-to-fill planes, or if passengers will want to fly in a more crowded cabin.

"Recaro lands 9000-seat BA, Iberia shorthaul Airbus fleet order - Runway Girl Network","Mon, 10 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDQvcmVjYXJvLWxhbmRzLTkwMDAtc2VhdC1iYS1pYmVyaWEtc2hvcnRoYXVsLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldC1vcmRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An impressive nine thousand Recaro SL3510 9-kilo ultra-lightweight barebones slimline aircraft seats are arriving from 2018 for British Airways and Iberia’s Airbus A320 family fleets following a large order on the Monday after this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo. The SL3510 won a Crystal Cabin Award in 2009, was first ordered in 2010 by Air France, which jointly developed the seat with Recaro, and is also in service on key BA competitor easyJet.

The Recaro seats will be installed on forthcoming A320neo and A321neo aircraft for delivery starting in 2018, and will also be refitted onto the existing Iberia A320ceo fleet. Interestingly, the images supplied by Recaro do not offer either in-seat power, an eye-level literature pocket, or space for BA’s and Iberia’s buy-on-board menus.

For BA, the move seems set to reduce the mediocre consistency of the airline’s 30”-pitched B/E Aerospace Pinnacle seats, which appear across the airline’s shorthaul A320 family fleet. Overall, the initial reaction from BA flyers RGN spoke with has been relatively positive given the knee crunch of Pinnacle. Much less consistent Iberia has a better opportunity to standardise its fleet.

Recaro had been dropping hints about a large order being finalised during this year’s AIX, but the size of the order is impressive, as is the fact that these seats have won out over longterm BA supplier B/E. It is not clear whether the BA and Iberia order includes the Smart Cabin Reconfiguration flexible pitch option that Recaro and Airbus developed on the SL3510 platform, which won a Crystal Cabin Award last week in Hamburg.

Slimlines like the SL3510 have proven controversial for customers. Taller passengers like the fact that the thin seatback provides extra knee space compared with thicker seats at the same pitch. Other passengers, particularly those not of ample posterior, have found the relative lack of seat cushion in existing implementations of the product to be disappointing in the comfort stakes. An opportunity, perhaps, for BA and Iberia to add some extra cushion for what BA’s CEO promises will be “an outstanding level of comfort”.

“The SL3510 model from Recaro fulfills all of our expectations and offers our demanding customers an outstanding level of comfort,” BA chief executive officer Alex Cruz says about the deal. British Airways’ economy customers, who have seen across-the-board #PaxEx cuts under Cruz’s tenure, are unlikely to take much comfort from these promises.

“Recaro is a premium seating manufacturer and partner that offers outstanding customer service and optimum delivery times,” Cruz continues, and indeed Recaro is one of a very small number of suppliers in the seating business around which rumours of delays and airline frustration are not swirling.

Luis Gallego, Iberia chief executive, is just as superlatively enthralled as BA’s Cruz: “We are especially proud of the balance between comfort and economy achieved by the new Recaro SL3510 seats. The design makes the seats incredibly comfortable, while freeing up extra legroom for all our passengers.”

“With its innovative and both environmentally and economically attractive characteristics, the award-winning SL3510 sets global standards and is one of the best seats in its class. Which makes me all the more pleased that IAG, which sets the benchmark in the market, has opted for our solution,” Recaro CEO Mark Hiller enthuses.

It is unclear how BA’s adoption of an eight-year-old product seven years after others in the market is benchmark-setting.

Recaro did not immediately respond to queries about whether the deal included the Smart Cabin Reconfiguration system, or about whether the seats ordered would be outfitted with power for passengers. While BA’s existing Pinnacle seats do not offer power, some of Iberia’s more disparate shorthaul aircraft do.

Airbus A380 cabin package adds 80 seats. - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWNhYmluLXBhY2thZ2UtYWRkcy04MC1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane-maker Airbus is giving airlines the option to cram 80 more seats into its passenger-friendly A380 superjumbo with a new package of “cabin enablers’’ that includes its derided 11-abreast seating.

Some of the changes provide more room for the seats by modifying the cabin layout while others squeeze more people into each row.

The average seat count on an A380 in operation today is 497 — below the suggested count of 550 — and the extra space has made it a popular choice with passengers.

But the pressures that have delivered passengers low fares also mean carriers are seeking new ways to generate revenue and this includes boosting the seat count on aircraft.

With sales of the A380 stalled and the rise of a new generation of fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft, Airbus is looking at ways of making the giant plane more attractive.

The new package, released at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, would allow airlines to carry 575 passengers in a four-class configuration.

It includes new forward stairs that would provide for 20 more passengers in business, premium economy and economy class.

The stairs would be relocated from door one to door two and the entrance to the staircase would be combined with that of the lower-deck crew rest.

A combined crew rest compartment would provide space for three more premium economy passengers by moving the existing pilot crew rest, located behind the cockpit in the mezzanine area of door one, with the facility on the lower deck.

An aft galley stair module which would see the current spiral stairs changed to a square design provides space for 14 more passengers plus two additional food trolleys.

An option to remove sidewall stowage would increase the wall-to-wall cabin width at foot-rest height and make space for 10 more business class seats in a herringbone layout.

More contentious options include nine-abreast premium economy on the main deck, allowing for 11 more passengers, and the previous released 11-abreast economy layout on the main deck, which adds 23 seats.

Premium economy varies between airlines. Qantas, for example, currently offers a comfortable upper-deck seven-abreast layout on a two-three-two basis while Lufthansa offers eight abreast on the same deck in a two-four-two configuration.

A nine-abreast configuration would presumably see a three-three-three layout, eliminating the popular double seats.

Airbus said the main deck cross-section was allowing seat manufacturers to optimise their premium economy offerings to create “the industry’s most efficient and comfortable PE layout possible’’.

More problematic is Airbus’ “innovative” 11-across concept involving a 3-5-3 configuration. Notwithstanding issues identified with the seats next to the cabin wall, this would put one passenger in the horror predicament of being in a middle seat with two people on either side.

The A380’s biggest customer, Emirates, has already rejected the concept, which has the potential to do to the A380’s reputation what 10-abreast seating has done to Boeing’s 777.

Airbus Commercial Aircraft executive vice president strategy and marketing Kiran Rao said the new package for A380 customers was a smart way to meet airlines needs “while improving the A380 economics with additional revenues and innovating in passenger comfort”.

“Only the A380 has the economies of scale and development potential to efficiently solve the problem of increasing congestion at large airports while providing the best comfort for passengers,’’ he said. “The aircraft can also serve fast-growing markets and airlines regional airports, so we are adapting the aircraft to meet evolving market needs.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9981895089149475}",neutral,0.9981895089149475,0

[Provided to chinadaily.com.cn]

China Southern Airlines has signed a deal worth nearly $6 billion to buy 20 aircraft from European plane maker Airbus SAS, the carrier announced on Wednesday.

The price of each Airbus A350-900 aircraft is at about $298.9 million, including airframe and engine, according to the catalogue price of Airbus SAS, a division of the multinational Airbus Group SE that manufactures civil aircraft.

The Guangzhou-based company, which ranks as Asia's largest airline by passenger numbers, will take delivery of the A350-900s starting in 2019, with all of the planes to be handed over by the end of 2022.

The total consideration will be paid to Airbus SAS in installments according to the respective delivery schedule for each of the relevant Airbus Aircraft from 2019 to 2022, according to the announcement.

China Southern, which recently agreed to sell a minority stake to American Airlines, is buying its first A350s as part of a push to expand the fleet to 1,000 planes by 2020 from 700 now, said Wang Changshun, the president.

The Airbus aircraft will boost China Southern Airlines' capacity in Aircraft Transport Kits or ATKs by 12.1 percent versus the level as of December 31, without accounting for retirements, said the company.

The Airbus A350-900 model can carry 325 passengers and 16 tons of cargo in a typical configuration, according to information on the Airbus website.

China Southern and its units have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing Co since 2015 as more people fly in the world’s most populous nation. The airline has been adding routes to Australia, New Zealand and countries in Southeast Asia as it competes with China Eastern Airlines Corp and Air China Ltd.

The International Air Transport Association predicts China will surpass the US to become the world's biggest air-travel market by 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99994957447052}",neutral,0.99994957447052,0

Virgin America Becomes World's First Airbus A321neo Operator - AirlineGeeks.com,"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA0LzIwL3Zpcmdpbi1hbWVyaWNhLWJlY29tZXMtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLW9wZXJhdG9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ News ] By Ryan Ewing

On Thursday, Virgin America took delivery of their first Airbus A321neo aircraft, becoming the initial operator for the Airbus narrow-body airplane.

The New Engine Option (NEO) aircraft is powered by CFM International’s LEAP-1A power plants, which reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by approximately 15 percent. The engines also provide a 50 percent cut in overall NOx emissions. In 2015, the LEAP-1A received certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

Virgin America was the first carrier to sign orders for the A321neo in December 2010 with plans to acquire ten frames.

After being acquired by Seattle-based Alaska Airlines in December 2016, Virgin’s orders for the A321neo are likely to change as Alaska begins preparations for a merged fleet in the coming years.

In addition to positive fuel efficiency, the A321/A320neo aircraft offer significant noise reductions making them perfect candidates for airports under intense noise abatement regulations. With over 1,300 units currently on order, the aircraft spreads across all markets, including both short-range and long-haul flights.

The carrier operates 63 current engine option A319 and A320 aircraft. The A321neo aircraft are leased from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

The new airplane will begin scheduled operations next month with flights from San Francisco to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C. According to the schedule, the DCA route will likely begin on May 31 and New York-JFK on June 14. The A321neo has a maximum range of 3,700 nautical miles with Sharklets.

The aircraft will feature 185 seats in total, an increase of 36 seats from the 149 seat Airbus A320. The new cabins will feature the current amenities that customers have grown accustomed to on Virgin America flights, including power ports in every seat, in-flight Wi-Fi, and a special in-flight menu.

“After Virgin America having been the first customer signing for the A320neo back in December 2010, we are today delighted to deliver the first A321neo to them,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President of Commercial Aircraft.

“With our largest, latest, most fuel efficient NEO Single Aisle aircraft we are turning a new page. The new A321neo powered by next generation CFM LEAP-1A engines guarantees new levels of efficiency and longer range to its operators, greater comfort to the flying public and less emissions and noise to the airport communities. Thanks to its cutting edge technologies it is today the most eco-sensitive Single Aisle aircraft available,” he continued.

N921VA (MSN 7589) ferried from Airbus’ manufacturing facility in Hamburg to Bangor, Maine on Thursday. The aircraft will then head to Miami International Airport for configuration. Virgin America contracts heavy maintenance and modifications to AAR’s facility in Miami.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp <JBLU.O> said it was postponing delivery of 13 aircraft scheduled for 2019 and 2020, and had swapped its 2018 Airbus order of A321neos to 11 A321ceos, which have an earlier engine design.

In its first quarter earnings call, JetBlue said it was deferring eight aircraft from 2019 to 2023 and five aircraft from 2020 to 2024.

Deliveries of Pratt & Whitney engines have been disrupted by various technical problems, forcing Airbus to replace some A320neo jets with the earlier model to keep production lines flowing smoothly. It has made extra copies of the earlier type available for airlines that want them.

Differences in fuel performance are less obvious when planes fly shorter routes.

One expert said as many as 72 of the new Pratt engines have been taken off the wings of A320neo aircraft for inspection or repairs since entering service.

As of mid-April, Airbus had delivered a total of 100 A320neo aircraft since the fuel-efficient plane entered service in January 2016, including 53 fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines and the rest with CFM engines.

These include 32 so far this year out of a total of some 200 targeted for 2017 as a whole.

Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest said swapping the neos for the ceos between 2018 and 2019 ""is just prudent"" for the carrier.

The airframe will become the first foreign type in the Russian airline’s fleet.

According to open source data, the aircraft painted in the Red Wings livery was built in 1998, and was previously operated by Greece’s Olympus Airways.

The aircraft is equipped with IAE V2500 engines, which are not very common in Russia.

Red Wings’ plans to lease A321s were announced in February 2017 by Alexander Rubtsov, CEO of the carrier’s parent company Ilyushin Finance Co.

The photograph of the A321 in the Red Wings livery indicates that the project has not been abandoned. Rubtsov commented for Russian Aviation Insider in late March that the carrier had purchased two A321s. According to the Federal Air Transport Agency, the airline currently operates seven Russian-built airliners, including six Tupolev Tu-204s and a single Tu-214.

Rubtsov offered two reasons for the A321 move. First, Red Wings’ 210-seat Tu-204s have similar characteristics to the Airbus airliners. Second, the A321s will complement the Airbus A320s to be eventually operated by partner airline Nordavia.

Rubtsov also commented on Red Wings’ plans to add Irkut MC-21 airliners to its fleet: “We view the Airbus A321 as an interim type in the run-up to the beginning of MC-21 deliveries. With Airbus A321s in our fleet we expect to increase our traffic volumes and expand the number of destinations served. This would be impossible to do with our Tu-204s alone because proper utilization of the type is difficult to achieve in winter. Until now we have intentionally minimized the frequency of operations during the winter months, which is, of course, not conducive to building a proper route network.”

Red Wings served 58,400 passengers in January and February 2017, or 38.4% down year-on-year, due to the carrier’s having phased out its Superjet SSJ100 regional jetliners last summer.

AIX: Airbus boosts A380 capacity by 20 with redesigned front stairs - Flightglobal,"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL3N5c3RlbXMtYW5kLWludGVyaW9ycy9haXgtYWlyYnVzLWJvb3N0cy1hMzgwLWNhcGFjaXR5LWJ5LTIwLXdpdGgtcmVkZXNpZ25lZC1mcm9udC1zdGFpcnMvMTIzNTcwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is today unveiling a redesigned front staircase for the A380 that it says will create room for 20 more passengers. This is part of an ongoing campaign of cabin tweaks to boost the type’s capacity by up to 80 seats – something Toulouse believes could broaden the appeal of the slow-selling superjumbo.

The airframer is showing on its stand a scale model of the staircase, which will be offered as an option on future orders. The feature could eventually become standard, and even be made available as a retrofit, says Roland Naudy, aircraft interiors marketing director for the A380.

The redesign sees the front stairs moved from door one to door two on the main deck and combined with the access to the crew rest area, currently at door two. Rather than facing forward, the stairs will be aligned to the left of the aircraft. On the upper deck, the staircase will be replaced by a new galley area.

The changes will make room on the main deck for typicallytwo additional business class seats, six premium economy and 12 economy seats, says Naudy.

Part of the reason for the redesign is that virtually all airports to which the A380 operates have facilities that allow direct access to both decks. This makes the staircase virtually redundant from a passenger point of view, Naudy says.

The new front staircase is one of a package of flexible “cabin enablers” that Airbus is showcasing in an effort to make the A380 “more efficient”. “We are fitting more capacity without compromising the aircraft,” Naudy adds.

Redesigned rear stairs are already offered in the Airbus catalogue. The spiral shape has been replaced by a more “square” design that allows trolleys to be stored as part of the stair complex. Moving trolleys from door four to the rear of the aircraft creates space for 14 economy seats, says Naudy. The option has been selected by an existing A380 operator, he says, but is not in service yet.

Airbus is also promoting an 11-abreast economy configuration on the main deck, which it says adds an extra standard 18in-wide seat by moving the seat row closer to the sidewall, slightly narrowing the aisle and “optimising the arm rest design”.

The airframer is also offering a nine-abreast premium economy design for the main deck. Five A380 operators – Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa, Qantas, and Singapore Airlines – offer a premium economy cabin at eight- or seven-abreast, but no one has yet selected the nine-abreast configuration, says Airbus.

Airbus says that, taken together, its A380 changes could increase capacity by 80 seats – something it believes is critical as it transitions the branding of the superjumbo from a high-end transport offering the potential for bars and other upmarket communal zones to a high-capacity people mover. The airframer reckons the extra seats would equate to $12 million extra revenue for an airline per aircraft.

The biggest member of the A320neo family has been a success for the European manufacturer with more than 1300 aircraft on order as airlines move to take advantage of its increased seating capacity and extended range.

The 185-seat plane was in Virgin Atlantic livery, a paint job unlikely to last long given the announcement by new owner Alaska Airlines that it intends to retire the brand, probably in 2019.

The A321neo is powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines that help deliver the aircraft’s 15 per cent improvement in efficiency.

“With our largest, latest, most fuel efficient NEO Single Aisle aircraft we are turning a new page, Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier said in a statement. “The new A321neo powered by next generation CFM LEAP-1A engines guarantees new levels of efficiency and longer range to its operators, greater comfort to the flying public and less emissions and noise to the airport communities.’’

The A321neo has a 24 per cent higher capacity than Virgin America’s A320s and will offer three classes of service, touch-screen personal entertainment and power outlets at every seat.

Virgin agreed to lease 10 A321neos from lessor GECAS and the aircraft delivered Thursday is expected to enter service on May 31 with an inaugural flight from San Francisco International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The airline has an all-Airbus fleet that includes A320s and A319s.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",positive,0.9999982118606567,1
Flight Cuts at Emirates Are a Bad Sign for Airbus. What About Boeing? - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE3LzA0LzIyL2ZsaWdodC1jdXRzLWVtaXJhdGVzLWJhZC1zaWduLWZvci1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Demand weakness could reduce Emirates' appetite for ordering new planes in the next few years -- but that might not be bad for Boeing in the long run.

After years of strong growth in the U.S., Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates is flying into some headwinds. Earlier this week, the carrier announced that it will slash capacity on its routes from Dubai to Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando.

Any slowdown in demand at Emirates is bad news for Airbus (EADSY -1.50%), because Emirates is by far the biggest customer for its A380 jumbo jet. However, the potential impact on Boeing (BA -2.45%) is harder to determine. If Emirates' woes force Airbus to kill off the A380, then Boeing could actually benefit in the long run.

Emirates flies into headwinds

Emirates' run of strong demand growth in the U.S. came to a sudden halt early this year after the Trump administration attempted to restrict travel to the U.S. by citizens of various Muslim-majority countries. While the initial ""travel ban"" didn't survive a court challenge, it led to an instantaneous 35% drop in bookings for Emirates' routes to the United States.

The final straw was a new rule implemented a month ago that prohibits passengers flying to the U.S. from several cities -- including Emirates' hub in Dubai -- from bringing laptops or tablets as carry-on items. While this is ostensibly a security measure, it has the secondary effect of making it very hard for business travelers to get work done in the air. Thus, this rule makes connecting in Europe look like a more attractive option for travel to the U.S.

Emirates has tried to lessen the impact on customers via a laptop and tablet handling service that allows customers to use their electronic devices right until it's time to board in Dubai. It is also loaning Surface tablets to business-class and first-class customers on flights to the U.S.

These efforts have only partially addressed the headwinds Emirates faces on its U.S. routes. That's unfortunate, as Emirates had been counting on the U.S. to pick up some of the slack for weak demand elsewhere in the world. This in turn creates risks for Boeing and Airbus, as Emirates is a key customer for both companies.

Standing by the A380 -- for now

If Emirates is having trouble filling its flights, that removes one of the big rationales for operating a large fleet of Airbus A380 jumbo jets.

Of course, Emirates' A380s do offer unique amenities like showers for first-class customers and an onboard lounge for business-class customers. Yet the main reason for operating such large planes is that it allows Emirates to carry more customers without adding flights at Dubai's overcrowded airport. If demand is lower, then it would be sensible to use smaller planes.

For now, Emirates remains committed to the A380. For example, it is showcasing a redesigned version of its A380 onboard lounge at an exhibition this week. But it's one thing to talk up a plane that is one the mainstays of its fleet and another thing entirely to order a bunch more.

If demand doesn't rebound within the next few years, it could be fatal to the A380. As of the end of March, Airbus had a backlog of 107 A380 orders, including 48 orders from Emirates. This understates the A380's woes, though. Last year, aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia noted that only 18 of Airbus' A380 orders from customers other than Emirates were truly secure. Some of those aircraft have been delivered in the past year, leaving only 12 truly firm non-Emirates A380 orders today.

Airbus is in the midst of reducing A380 production to a rate of one per month to cope with the shrinking backlog. At that pace, it will be a struggle just to break even -- and Airbus will still run out of orders in five years.

That may seem like plenty of time to drum up more orders. But Emirates is the only airline to have ordered the A380 in meaningful numbers in the past few years. If it doesn't place another big order within the next three years, Airbus will probably be forced to start winding down A380 production.

Mixed signals for Boeing

At first glance, Emirates' woes would seem to be an even bigger threat to Boeing. After all, Emirates has 150 orders for the upcoming 777X, representing nearly half of the order book. Moreover, the 777X will be far more meaningful for Boeing's profitability than the A380 is for Airbus' profitability at this point.

There certainly is some risk that Emirates will defer some of its 777X orders if demand stays weak. That said, most of its 777X orders are timed to match planned retirements from its 777 fleet.

A bigger potential concern is that a demand slowdown at Emirates could discourage it from ordering Boeing's 787 Dreamliner in the next year or two. Boeing needs to sell a lot more Dreamliners to avoid cutting production after 2020.

Yet in the long run, the death of the A380 would more than make up for these negatives. Most importantly, it would ensure that Emirates -- and virtually any other airline looking for a large widebody -- would turn to Boeing's 777X for future orders.

A greater focus at Emirates on matching capacity to demand would also raise the odds of an eventual Dreamliner order, even if it comes later than originally hoped for. Boeing's 787-9 is the smallest airplane capable of flying most of Emirates' routes, and it can do so with very competitive unit costs. As a result, if Emirates operated the 787-9, it would be better able to reduce capacity in weaker markets without cutting flights.

Thus, in the short run, Emirates' slump could negatively impact both Boeing and Airbus. However, if it takes Emirates a while to get back on track, Airbus is likely to bear the brunt of the damage -- and Boeing could actually come out ahead.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9941967725753784}",negative,0.9941967725753784,-1

In the case of the A330neo plane, a 3D printed part helps to create an “enhanced passenger experience“, while 3D printed construction aids have been applied to develop the ‘oversized’ Beluga XL cargo plane.

Increased baggage space

According to Airbus, the A330neo aircraft is the “launch vehicle for the Airspace by Airbus cabin philosophy” designed to give passengers a more luxurious travelling experience. To help create this environment, Airbus has redesigned the cabin with larger overhead lockers.

The company made this possible by adapting the air nozzle for the cabin’s climate control system with a 3D printed design. Airbus explained using 3D printing enabled, “fast reaction that saves both time and money.”

Beluga XL

The whale-inspired Beluga XL is designed to carry large parts and is expected to be in deployment by 2020. A drill rack masking cover has been 3D printed by the company, aiding in the construction of the plane. Marc Carré, the Mock-Up Integrator for Manufacturing at Airbus Commercial Aircraft, explained this process,

Operators come to me with a specific need and we discuss what’s possible, then I build a customised, computer-generated solution for manufacturing with the 3D printer.

Re-engineering luxury

Utilizing 3D printed design has the potential of saving space while cutting costs and lead times. In this case, Airbus has been enabled to rethink their cabin size. Similarly, GE has used 3D printing to optimize the functional design of the LEAP engine fuel nozzle. The 3D printed metal nozzle has now been certified for use by the Federal Aviation Administration.

UAE luxury airlines Etihad Airways has also begun incorporating 3D printed design in their interior cabins, with 3D printed monitor frames produced by Strata manufacturing.

Perlan Project CEO Ed Warnock said: “This past year, our team gained invaluable insight and experience from flying the glider in and around the Andes Mountains.

“Using that information, we’ve made improvements to the aircraft that will help us have even greater success this year, first in Nevada and later in Argentina, if the wave and weather conditions are optimal.”

For the latest flight, the Perlan Project team has updated the Perlan 2 glider. The updates include a pressurised cockpit, enhanced avionics and life support systems.

Airbus unveils A380 “cabin space optimisation” range – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAxNy8wNC8wNy9haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1hMzgwLWNhYmluLXNwYWNlLW9wdGltaXNhdGlvbi1yYW5nZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled a range of new “Cabin Enablers” for its A380 superjumbo aircraft, which it says can create space for around 80 additional seats.

The product offering includes a newly designed front staircase, which the manufacturer says would free up space for 20 extra passengers.

Other “enablers” – some of which are already offered to airlines – include an 11-across (3-5-3) economy layout on the main deck (adding 23 economy seats), a nine-across premium economy layout on the main deck (adding 11 passengers), a redesigned rear staircase and aft-galley (adding space for 14 more passengers), and the removal of the upper deck sidewall stowage (increasing business class capacity by ten seats).

Airbus said that “an innovative seating concept” allows airlines to offer an 18-inch seat width in economy while moving to a 3-5-3 layout.

Commenting on the new package of cabin options Dr Kiran Rao, EVP of Strategy and Marketing at Airbus Commercial Aircraft said:

“Continuous improvement of our products is our daily work. This new package for our A380 customers is a smart way to meet airline needs while improving the A380 economics with additional revenues and innovating in passenger comfort.”

“Only the A380 has the economies of scale and development potential to efficiently solve the problem of increasing congestion at large airports while providing the best comfort for passengers. The aircraft can also serve fast growing markets and airlines regional airports, so we are adapting the aircraft to meet evolving market needs.”

Airbus has struggled to attract new customers for its superjumbo aircraft, with 13 commercial carriers currently operating the A380, and Japanese airline ANA set to take delivery of its first superjumbo in 2019.

Of the just over 200 superjumbos so far delivered, almost half of these are operated by one carrier – Emirates.

In a recent interview with Business Traveller, Malaysia Airlines CEO Peter Bellew said that airlines have “missed the point” of the A380, claiming that the sweet spot for the aircraft was between 640 and 720 passengers, serving high density flights between congested airports.

Emirates operates some of its superjumbos in a two-class configuration with 625 seats, and Malaysia Airlines is set to reconfigure its six A380s into all-economy and two-class layouts, and move them into a separate company serving Hajj and Umraa pilgrimage flights and lease services.

This week, a Lufthansa Airbus A321 is preparing to depart Hamburg Airport as evening closes in.

This Airbus A321 has a bit of interesting history behind it. Whilst it is in standard Lufthansa house colours (and has been part of the Lufthansa fleet since 1998), this plane was previously in a retro livery to celebrate 50 years of Lufthansa.

It seems that D-AIRX “Weimar” has now been painted back into normal Lufthansa house livery, serving the Lufthansa network.

Lufthansa operate a fleet of 20 A321-100 aircraft. The airline also operates the A321-200, A320, A319 and the A320neo family on short to mid-haul routes.

Haeco and Airbus announce a way to increase overhead bin space - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNy8wNC8wNC9oYWVjby1haXJidXMtYW5ub3VuY2Utd2F5LWluY3JlYXNlLW92ZXJoZWFkLWJpbi1zcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At Economy Class and Beyond, we’re slightly obsessed about overhead bins. When I say slightly – see my piece last year about the Airbus vs Boeing overhead bin I wrote last year at Aircraft Interiors Expo 2016.

But why? It’s a big passenger experience thing. It allows people to stow their items without worrying about their safety too much. Of course there’s a problem along with that – the distinct lack of overhead bin space that’s aboard planes as passengers fill out their hand baggage quotas.

Haeco has partnered with Airbus to deliver a ceiling mounted overhead bin (Ceiling stowage compartment). Now, you’re thinking to yourself why that’s important, scroll past the first image.

The ceiling stowage compartment can be used to store large items (up to 35kg), releasing the space they are taking in the cabin overhead bins. So things like life rafts, baby bassinets, survival kits – and even crew luggage.

Here it is in action, holding a dummy raft.

The bin deployed – Images, Economy Class and Beyond

So this has many applications. In this mockup – it was sized to the height of an A320 type aircraft – so should allow plenty of headroom when entering or leaving an aircraft.

Currently, Haeco will be offering this as a line-fit option, with a retro-fit version in the works.

Depending on the type of A320 family will depend how many of these ceiling mounted bins you can fit.

Airbus A319 – Up to two (one forward cabin, one rear cabin)

Airbus A320 – Up to two (one forward cabin, one rear cabin)

Airbus A321 – Up to three (one forward cabin, one rear cabin and one in the mid cabin)

These bins will start appearing line-fitted to aircraft from Q1 2018. A customer has been defined – but has not been announced.

Again – Airbus is making use of the space in the aircraft as best as possible and trying to release precious overhead bin space. And whilst it may not be a lot of space, it will allow a few more bags to be squeezed aboard a plane.

The Syrian ministry of transport says that a ceremony in Damascus has welcomed the aircraft, with attending delegates including transport minister Ali Hammoud.

Syrian Arab Airlines’ aircraft (YK-AZA) is a 17-year old airframe originally delivered on lease to Cathay Pacific.

The aircraft’s layout includes 24 business-class seats, says the ministry, which adds that it will shortly be used on Chinese routes.

“Air transport is of great importance in supporting the country’s economy,” says the ministry, adding that it contributes additional revenues to the state treasury.

Syria remains subject to US government sanctions and the A340’s transfer to Syrian Arab Airlines appears to have been a very complex affair.

Flight Fleets Analyzer indicates that the jet was returned to AerCap in 2015 after a lease to SriLankan Airlines.

But it was subsequently placed on the US registry, and was eventually passed to an undisclosed entity before being transferred to Kazakhstan, where it was stored on the local register as UP-A4001, before being transferred to the Chad registry and then to Syria.

Estimated reading time 2 minutes, 19 seconds.

The first Airbus A319neo, the smallest member of the A320neo family, performed its maiden flight on March 31, powered by CFM International LEAP-1A engines. The aircraft took off from Hamburg, Germany, and landed in Toulouse, France, after a five-hour flight.

It was piloted by experimental test pilots Michel Gagneux and Eckard Hausser. They were assisted in the cockpit by test-flight engineer Jean Michel Pin, while two flight test engineers Sylvie Loisel-Labaste and David O’nions directed the flight from the aircraft’s test engineer station.

This flight was the occasion for the crew to assess the general handling of the aircraft and to check the main systems. The A319neo, registered as D-AVWA, will be based in Toulouse in order to complete its flight test program.

The A320neo family is one of the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with over 5,000 orders received from over 90 customers, capturing almost 60 per cent share of the market. The A320neo family incorporates latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklet wing tip devices, which together deliver more than 15 per cent in fuel savings from day one and 20 per cent by 2020.

Thanks to their widest cabin, all members of the A320neo family offer unmatched comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18-inches-wide seats in economy as standard.

With one aircraft in three sizes ( A319neo, A320neo and A321neo), the A320neo family, seating from 100 to 240 passengers, seamlessly covers the entire single-aisle segment from low to high-density domestic to longer range routes.

The A319neo offers its operators superior short field performance in hot and high conditions. It can accommodate up to 160 passengers without compromise on the comfort.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5912907719612122}",positive,0.5912907719612122,1
