CNN —

Much has been said about the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing and the Airbus A320 features prominently in this.

The twin-engined A320 entered service in 1988, some two decades after its single-aisle rival, Boeing’s 737.

There have been a total of 11,163 orders for the A320, with 6,331 deliveries to date and slightly less aircraft flying globally by over 300 operators.

The A320 family ranges from the smaller A318 (around 100 seats), to the upgraded A321 (around 185 to 220 passengers depending on the class configuration).

The short to medium-range A320 is the most popular version with a range of about 3,300 nautical miles or 6,150 kilometers. It has a wing span of 35.80 meters (with Sharklets), a length of 37.57 meters and a max payload of 16.6 tonnes, according to Airbus.

Budget carrier AirAsia is the largest commercial airline customer of the A320, with 184 orders and 157 deliveries of the A320.

It has an additional 291 orders of the next generation A320, the A320neo (new engine option), according to Airbus data.

The A320neo is powered by twin Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fans – a 20-year research-and-development gamble that brings Pratt & Whitney back into the arena as a major player in single-aisle airplane powerplants.

The A320neo first flew in September and is due to enter service in October 2015.

Flight QZ8501

The aircraft involved in Sunday’s AirAsia Flight QZ8501 incident is an A320-200 operated by AirAsia Indonesia. A statement from Airbus said the plane was powered by CFM 56-5B engines and had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights.

Airbus says it will provide full assistance in the investigation into flight QZ8501.

According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320.

“Aviation is safe – it is crucial to observe the full detail on why the aircraft crashed,” says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group.

“In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes right through to hull-losses through pilot error. Most aircraft have teething problems and in most cases these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters – largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event.”

The worst in terms of fatalities was the 2007 crash of a TAM Linhas Aereas plane that killed all 187 on board, plus a further 12 people on the ground when it failed to stop and went off the runway during landing in Sao Paulo in wet conditions.

In 2009, in an incident known as the “Miracle on the Hudson,” pilot Chesley Sullenberger landed a U.S. Airways A320 on the Hudson River in New York when the plane lost lost power in its engines after hitting a flock of geese. All on board survived."
Missing AirAsia Airbus Was Delivered in 2008 - Voice of America - VOA News,"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbWlzc2luZy1haXJhc2lhLWFpcmJ1cy13YXMtZGVsaXZlcmVkLWluLTIwMDgvMjU3NjU1MS5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL21pc3NpbmctYWlyYXNpYS1haXJidXMtd2FzLWRlbGl2ZXJlZC1pbi0yMDA4LzI1NzY1NTEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The AirAsia aircraft that went missing on Sunday on its way to Singapore from Surabaya in Indonesia was delivered to its operator in 2008 and had recorded 23,000 flight hours on 13,600 flights, manufacturer Airbus said in a statement.

AirAsia said the aircraft had undergone its last scheduled maintenance on November 16.

Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501, an Airbus 320-200 with 162 people aboard, lost contact with Jakarta air traffic control at 6:17 a.m. (2317 GMT), officials said. The pilots had asked to change course to avoid bad weather.

Favored by low-cost airlines

More than 6,000 A320-200s are in service. They are designed to be used intensively on short routes and are favored, along with the competing Boeing 737, by the low-cost airlines that run such routes.

Earlier in December, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ordered a change in procedure for all A320 jets after computers onboard a similar A321 aircraft thought it was about to stall and pushed the nose downwards - which is the standard way of preventing an upset - just as pilots were trying to level off after climbing to their intended cruise height.

The incident happened after certain sensors iced up in bad weather. It is thought to be the only one of its kind since the A320 entered service in 1988, but resulted in a special bulletin to operators from Airbus, which was later made compulsory by EASA.

In the worst scenario, pilots would not be able to stop the automatic reaction, which could result in loss of control of the airplane, EASA said.

So far there is no indication what may have caused the AirAsia jet to go missing.

Commercial web tracking data suggested Flight QZ8501 had been in level flight for some time when it disappeared from radar, rather than at the top of the climb when the reported anomaly - although rare - is most likely to take place.

Declines to comment

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the EASA directive, saying it was too early to speculate ahead of any investigation.

France's BEA crash investigation agency, which assists in the investigation of any air crash involving an Airbus aircraft because the company is France-based, said it was sending two officials to Jakarta accompanied by two experts from Airbus.

The aircraft's engines were made by French-American venture CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and Safran.

The U.S.-based National Transportation Safety Board, which could also take part in any investigation, said it was monitoring the search for the plane and stood ready to assist Indonesia if needed."
Airbus Sells In-orbit Spot 7 Imaging Satellite to Azerbaijan - SpaceNews,"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80Mjg0MGFpcmJ1cy1zZWxscy1pbi1vcmJpdC1zcG90LTctaW1hZ2luZy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdG8tYXplcmJhaWphbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LUXEMBOURG — Airbus Defence and Space has agreed to sell its Spot 7 medium-resolution optical Earth observation satellite, which just finished in-orbit checkout, to Azerbaijan’s Azercosmos space agency as part of a long-term partnership in commercial remote sensing, Airbus and Azercosmos announced Dec. 2.

As part of the unusual agreement, whose financial terms were not disclosed, Azercosmos has taken title to Spot 7, renamed it Azersky and has been given preferred-access rights to the orbiting Spot 6 to market the satellites’ imagery in Azerbaijan and surrounding regions in South Asia.

Airbus will build a satellite control center in Azerbaijan and will train a team of more than 25 Azeri engineers in France during the next 18 months.

Airbus retains preferred marketing rights to Spot 7 beyond Azerbaijan and the Azercosmos marketing area.

The agreement was signed in the Azeri capital of Baku in the presence of the country’s president, Ilham Aliyev, who was there for the acquisition of the first commercial image from Spot 7, which was launched in July and has been undergoing in-orbit tests since then. A Franco-Azeri summit earlier this year set the stage for the Earth observation partnership.

Azercosmos officials have said their agency, which began operating its first telecommunications satellite in 2013, includes telecommunications and Earth observation development in its mandate.

Unlike the first five Spot satellites, the French government did not help finance the development and launch of Spot 6 and Spot 7. Airbus officials said they spent 300 million euros ($375 million) building and launching the satellites, which are now used as part of a four-satellite constellation that also includes two Pleiades high-resolution spacecraft.

Spot 6 and Spot 7 are identical spacecraft capable of producing images with a ground resolution of 1.5 meters in diameter. The two Pleiades satellites, which were financed by the French government but to which Airbus has access for its commercial business, are capable of generating images with a 70-centimeter resolution when looking straight down, and 50 centimeters after resampling.

Airbus spokesman Bruno Daffix said Dec. 3 that Airbus retains responsibility for marketing Spot 7/Azersky imagery outside the preferred distribution area in South Asia carved out for Azercosmos.

Azercosmos has expressed interest in its own high-resolution optical Earth imaging satellite, but agency officials and Airbus have said there is no automatic link between the cooperation agreement on Spot 6 and Spot 7 and a future Azeri satellite.

“This agreement … marks Azercosmos’ entry into the commercial Earth observation services business,” the agency said in a Dec. 2 statement. “This will strengthen Azerbaijan’s position among the limited number of countries rendering satellite services.”"
Europe Expands Airtanking with Airbus A330 Selection - Defense News,"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNC8xMi8xOS9ldXJvcGUtZXhwYW5kcy1haXJ0YW5raW5nLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtc2VsZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Three European nations plan are to pool their resources and purchase Airbus A330 multirole tanker transport aircraft starting in 2019.

The Netherlands, Poland and Norway are preparing to open negotiations with Airbus for a fleet of new aircraft, the European Defence Agency (EDA) announced on Friday .

The deal would help close a gap in European tanking capability most recently illustrated by the 2011 NATO mission against the Libyan regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi.

The selection of Airbus for negotiations follows a request for information this year from the European aerospace company and rival air tanker supplier Boeing, with the 767.

The three nations have agreed to create a NATO Support Agency partnership to run the program and has tasked OCCAR, the European collaborative defense equipment management organization, to open negotiations with Airbus.

A spokesman said they hope negotiations will be finalized with Airbus in 2016.

Industry executives said the three nations have given themselves a ""very challenging"" timeline to move from completion of negotiations to the start of operations, probably initially in the transport role.

The new European fleet will be equipped with a rigid boom as well as underwing refueling pods.

A minimum of four airframes are expected to be purchased, although the final number depends on the cost of the airframes and whether other European nations opt to join the program.

Ten European Union states, led by the Dutch, signed a letter of intent in November 2012 to consider acquiring new multi-role aircraft.

Belgium, France, Spain, Hungary and Portugal were among the other nations that signed the letter alongside the three nations now pushing ahead with the program.

The EDA spokesman said the assumption is the pooled aircraft will be based at the Dutch Air Force base at Eindhoven, where other European airlift operations are sited.

France recently signed a deal with Airbus to purchase 12 A330 planes for delivery starting 2018 to replace a fleet of aging US aircraft.

Britain also operates a fleet of A330 s through a private finance initiative arrangement with the Airbus-led AirTanker consortium.

Competition from Boeing forced Airbus to rethink wide-body jets - The Columbus Dispatch,"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdHJhdmVsLzIwMTQvMTIvMjYvY29tcGV0aXRpb24tZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctZm9yY2VkLWFpcmJ1cy8yMzgwMTM1NTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Competition from Boeing forced Airbus to rethink wide-body jets

PARIS — Ten years ago, the boss of Qatar Airways, which received its first new A350 jet this week, warned Airbus it was flying off course.

Boeing was knocking on his door with a “ superefficient” jet boasting 30 percent fuel savings, thanks to a carbon-composite design.

In Toulouse, some Airbus engineers, riding high after overtaking Boeing and suspecting a short-lived marketing stunt, laughed off the future 787 with a “tail like a dolphin.”

Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker urged Airbus to take the 787 seriously and said its draft response, a quick fix to its A330 with new General Electric engines, was inadequate.

As Qatar Airways planned for rapid regional and long-haul growth, Al Baker recalls, “There was a requirement for an aircraft that has capacity that is optimal on two fronts: customer comfort and technologically forward-thinking.”

That clamor for both cabin comfort and better economics eventually forced Airbus into a fundamental shift in strategy.

But after Al Baker’s warning, it took two more years of sales setbacks and doubts at the highest management level before Airbus agreed to build the A350XWB, which was delivered on Monday.

That story is revealed here after interviews with customers, suppliers and industry sources. Airbus declined to comment.

The fluctuating, decade-long journey from half-hearted tinkering to an all-new family of jets highlights a chess game still being played out as Airbus and Boeing battle each other in the wide-body market, valued at $1.9 trillion over 20 years.

Next month, the A350 will start competing with the 787 in the skies, having garnered 778 orders against 1,055 for the 787.

To build the carbon-plastic jets, plane-makers tested themselves to the limit.

Now, competition for sales is intense.

“I think they are now pretty well matched,” said Steven Udvar-Hazy, who as CEO of lessor ILFC at the time was the world’s biggest buyer of commercial jets and would prove to be an important influence on the A350’s development.

A decade ago, air travel was changing. Planes with two engines were able to fly farther and were more efficient than big jets with four engines.

Boeing’s twin-engine 777 was beating Airbus’s four-engine A340 in the market for big planes, and Airbus’ huge four-engine A380, the biggest airliner ever, had yet to enter service.

Airbus was strong in the market for small wide-body jets, doing well with its twin-engine A330. But fast-growing airlines such as Qatar and Emirates were demanding more comfortable cabins with space to install new lie-flat beds.

The change might have suggested a new fuselage, a decision plane-makers rarely take more than once every couple of decades.

But Airbus was behind in new-materials technology, focused on finishing the A380, and hoarding resources to improve its most profitable cash cow, the A320 small jet, in case Boeing refreshed its 737 model, people familiar with the matter said.

When Boeing launched the medium-size 787 to compete with the A330, Airbus responded defensively. Its answer, the A350, was basically an A330 with carbon wings and new engines, rather than a new plane.

“People were cringing at the time, saying it was inelegant or ‘How can you put a patch on a broken leg?’ ” said Henri Courpron, chairman of Plane View Partners and former head of Airbus North America.

Soon, Airbus customers in Boeing’s backyard, such as Northwest Airlines and Air Canada, were writing checks for 787s. Airbus found itself straining to compete with both flagship Boeings.

In December 2005, pressure reached a boiling point with two big Boeing wins. Qantas chose the 787; Cathay Pacific picked the 777.

An internal post-mortem on Qantas laid out the problem: The original A350 was “reactionary,” and Airbus had lost credibility.

Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert called in his 43-year-old strategy chief, Olivier Andries, and gave him a delicate task.

“I asked him to take the best guys and set up a long-range policy team,” said Humbert, who is now retired.

Humbert urged him to consider whether Airbus could capture 50 percent of the big-jet market, up from 35 to 40 percent, by straddling the largest 787 and smallest 777: around 300 seats.

“I was encouraged to think outside the box … about the whole long-range strategy,” said Andries, now CEO of the engine firm Turbomeca. He declined to discuss the details.

Monitored by a team of retired “Wise Men,” the group of 10 drew up confidential scenarios from makeovers to bold new jets.

In March 2006, Udvar-Hazy, who now runs Air Lease, piled on pressure by urging Airbus to drop its cautious A350.

“We looked at the economics and concluded it was not a contender in a meaningful way. So I felt it would get a silver medal and didn’t deserve to get built,” Udvar-Hazy said.

In Toulouse, it was proving hard to make the business cases stick, but one proposal labeled “1d” looked promising.

It dived deep into a planemaker’s armory of wings, cockpit, cabin, engines and the all-important wider fuselage.

It would cost about 11 billion euros to build, rather than the 4 billion budgeted for the original A350, while setting Airbus up for 20 years with projected sales of 2,000 planes instead of 800. But it was still a step behind Boeing’s 787: The tube would be in metal rather than carbon."
First Delivery of the Airbus A350 XWB - APEX Media,"Mon, 08 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2ZpcnN0LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Delivery of the Airbus A350 XWB Share

UPDATE Dec 12, 2014: Delivery of the Airbus A350 XWB to Qatar Airways has been rescheduled for December 22.

It’s always exciting when a new aircraft is delivered to an airline, and an even bigger event when it’s the first plane of a new design. That’ll next happen on December 13th, as Airbus and Qatar Airways get ready to celebrate the delivery of the very first Airbus A350 XWB.

Qatar Airways Group chief executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al-Baker, says, “The delivery of our first A350 XWB aircraft, as global launch customer, is a highly anticipated event in the relatively young history of Qatar Airways.”

This aircraft, the first of 80 A350 XWBs to be graced with Qatar Airways Arabian Oryx livery, will fly from Airbus’ factory in Toulouse, France on Saturday. The airline will introduce the A350 XWB at a big celebratory event on Monday, at its base in Doha, Qatar. The new plane’s first revenue flight is planned for mid-January, from Doha to Frankfurt, Germany. This 2,900 mile flight is just a short hop for the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered A350-900, which has a range of 7,750 miles.

Airbus has over 775 orders for the A350 XWB-series from 41 airlines. The aircraft features the latest in aerodynamic and design technologies, and passengers will experience new interior lighting, panoramic windows, and spacious overhead storage. As well, the A350’s state-of-the-art in-flight entertainment (IFE) system has been designed around a flat-floor wiring model, eliminating the plastic bumps that cover IFE cables in other aircraft.

“Qatar Airways is committed to offering our passengers the very best five-star experience when it comes to travelling, not only in terms of the custom-built comfort features across all of our cabins and the service on board, but with the investment and expansion of our modern fleet,” says Al-Baker. The Qatar A350-900s will seat 36 Business Class passengers and 247 in economy class, for a total of 283 seats."

The world's first delivery of an Airbus A350 will take place on Dec. 13, launch customer Qatar Airways announced Thursday morning.

The A350 is the newest aircraft model from Airbus. It will be the first entirely new model to be rolled out by the world's two big aircraft makers since Boeing delivered its first 787 ""Dreamliner"" in 2011.

Qatar Airways will be the first airline to receive the jet and to put it into commercial service. The carrier's first A350 flight with paying passengers is expected to come in January on a route between Qatar Airways' Doha hub and Frankfurt.

""The delivery of our first A350 XWB aircraft, as global launch customer, is a highly anticipated event in the relatively young history of Qatar Airways and the second significant fleet milestone for our airline, having recently taken delivery of our A380 aircraft,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker says in the statement announcing the delivery date.

""The arrival of this new generation of aircraft type represents a moment of great symbolic national pride for the State of Qatar, and I know its delivery will be met with excitement at its new home Hamad International Airport, which was built for advanced aircraft types such as this,"" Al Baker adds in the statement.

The A350 — along with Airbus' recently announced update to its A330 widebody — is expected to help Airbus ratchet up competition against U.S. rival Boeing in the long-haul market, where Boeing's 777 and 787 ""Dreamliner"" models have enjoyed strong sales. Both the A350 and Boeing's 787 are revolutionary models, manufactured with the use of carbon-composite fibers."
Airbus logistics provider innovates to support complex supply chain - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMTIvYWlyYnVzLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1wcm92aWRlci1pbm5vdmF0ZXMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1jb21wbGV4LXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG: An Airbus A380 aircraft, the commercial giant of the skies, is comprised of around 4 million individual parts. Though there are considerably fewer part numbers (approximately 2.5 million), the figure remains rather staggering. Many folks simply look at today’s great flying machines and see them as an awesome whole. But when viewed as the sum of 4 million parts, then one might begin to wonder just how these countless bits – large, medium and small alike – travel from their place of origin to arrive where they finally belong.

In 2008, Airbus signed a 6-year deal with Kuehne + Nagel, making the firm lead logistics provider for its entire logistics operation and exclusive manager of all hubs, warehouses and logistic services in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. The scope of Kuehne + Nagel’s responsibilities relating to Airbus’ increasingly complex production supply demands (and the geographical range of these activities) have widened continuously. In 2013, the contract between the logistics provider and airframer was extended through 2016 and both partners have been working relentlessly to optimise part flows, reduce inventory, implement lean management concepts and minimise handover points along the production supply chain.

In mid-December, as part of the 4th annual Aviation Forum in Hamburg, a bus filled with delegates (this writer included) was given the opportunity to tour the enormous logistic center operated by Kuehne + Nagel just 11 kilometers from Airbus’ Finkenwerder production line.

Innovation is rampant at the logistics centre and precision is the rule of thumb. For Airbus, Kuehne + Nagel acts as a 24-hour partner for supplier management, order placement and receipt, quality assurance, inventory control, customs clearance, rapid delivery and problem solving.

“In the last two years we have really built up this warehouse. We’ve expanded from 20,000 to 50,000 square meters,” revealed Simone Siewert, Kuehne + Nagel’s head of operations aerospace Germany. “As Airbus is growing to introduce new programs like the A350, we require new space for new services like our ‘marketplaces’. We push material into these marketplaces and Airbus can pull them out as required.”

Kuehne + Nagel has 80 engineers on staff all over Europe dedicated solely to achieving efficient control of parts destined to become airplanes. By communicating with Airbus and its suppliers, as well as their own warehouse workers, these guys and gals have come up with some brilliant ways to improve flow and inventory management in the logistics centre.

The team is able to move a critical shipment from an in-bound truck to point of use on the assembly line in as little as two hours.

In the marketplaces, where stock is stored in the short- to medium-term, the most frequently called-for items are placed at optimal ergonomic levels for rapid and comfortable order fulfillment by staff. Workers on the floor are also encouraged (and provided cash incentives) to submit ideas that will improve processes within the centre. Packaging is also a key area of concern in the supply chain and can be cumbersome for assembly line workers.

Working together Airbus, Kuehne + Nagel has developed a reusable packaging solution called TRAY. This specially adapted system sees logistics workers un-wrapping a number of deliveries for Airbus and packing them carefully into blue boxes with changeable foam inlays. This way, assembly personnel need simply grab the correct part and begin.

“We (Kuehne + Nagel) have a little more volume and handling effort to manage this way,” says Siewert of the TRAY system. “But from a handling point of view on Airbus side it is much easier. It works… and the Airbus workers are confident with this strategy.”

The TRAY system is fully operational on Airbus’ narrow-body programs and A380 in Hamburg, and could see implantation in wide-body production within the next year."

There’s a new airframe out in the public this week and it’s flying Airbus colors. The A350 XWB is Airbus’s answer to the Boeing 787. It’s composite. It’s lightweight. It’s efficient. And hopefully it can make up some of the ground that Boeing has been gobbling up with it’s highly successful 78 airframe.

Whether from Boeing or Airbus, it’s great to see innovation in the airline industry, and many enthusiastic aviation geeks like myself are looking forward to flying on the A350. Travelers in the US, however, may have to wait some time. The first scheduled deliveries of the aircraft are slated for Qatar Airways, so unless you have travel through Doha coming up it may be a while. United, US Airways and Hawaiian are the current mainline American carriers with orders.

The charges stem from border fortification contracts in Saudi Arabia and Romania.

The defense arm of Airbus is under investigation for bribery surrounding lucrative border security contracts in Romania and Saudi Arabia, prosecutors in Munich said Wednesday.

The case revolves around several employees of Airbus Defence and Space, formerly EADS, who allegedly bribed officials to secure contracts worth 3 billion euros ($3.69 billion).

A company spokesman confirmed the charges, saying the number of people involved was in the ""low single digits."" Airbus is Europe's largest defense contractor.

The spokesman also said that employees' offices and apartments had been raided in October, and that Airbus was cooperating with authorities. The aerospace giant had apparently been informed in advance of the charges and had already carried out an internal investigation before the raids took place.

Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung daily first reported on the investigation, which is being led by the public prosecutor's office in Munich.

According to the report, prosecutors caught wind of suspicious money transfers between Airbus and Saudi Arabia ""worth millions"" while probing other bribery allegations stemming from the sale of Eurofighter jets to Austria for more than 1.5 billion euros.

The alleged bribes to Saudi Arabia are believed to have helped the defense contractor secure a contract to fortify the kingdom's 9,000-kilometer (5,592-mile) border.

Nearly every major German defense contractor is currently facing some investigation into corruption allegations, Süddeutsche noted.

Daher-Socata To Build and Certify E-Fan for Airbus - FLYING,"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy1kYWhlci1zb2NhdGEtYnVpbGQtYW5kLWNlcnRpZnktZS1mYW4tYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Daher-Socata today announced it has signed on as a major partner with Airbus Group’s VoltAir subsidiary for the design, development and certification of a new electric airplane unveiled earlier this year called the E-Fan 2.0.

The all-electric two-seater is the first product in what is being billed as a full-scale electric aircraft development program, launched by Airbus Group with great fanfare earlier in the year. The E-Fan 2.0 is intended to be a general aviation trainer, and the first full-rate production electric aircraft in the world. One of the stated goals of the program is eventually to usher in an era of electrical applications for future Airbus airliners.

Under the agreement with Airbus, Daher-Socata will be responsible for the E-Fan 2.0’s entire development, including its electric engine and batteries, flight test and certification by EASA in Europe. The French manufacturer will also be responsible for helping define the operational framework and regulations for ab-initio pilot training with the French DGAC civil aviation airworthiness authority.

The contract, said officials, was the result of an initial 18-month phase of work studies conducted with Airbus Group, and comes at the perfect time for Daher-Socata, which introduced the TBM 900 single-engine turboprop a few months ago, freeing its engineering team to focus on the new project. It is predicted the E-Fan 2.0 eventually will be sold in the United States, although no potential pricing information has been revealed.

Daher-Socata has produced more than 700 TBMs as well as thousands more piston GA airplanes under the Rallye and TB lines.

Thales onboard the Airbus A350-900 - Thales,"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvYWVyb3NwYWNlL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLW9uYm9hcmQtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtOTAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales onboard the Airbus A350-900 Share this article



LinkedIn

Thales, who counts Airbus as one of its top customers, is very proud to contribute to the entry into service of the newest and most advanced aircraft, the A350-900.

Thales is involved in the A350 XWB program since 2008 for the development and supply of large avionics shipset and electrical power conversion and since 2010, for in-flight entertainment and connectivity. Thales is the most present Original Equipment Manufacturer present on the platform. All Thales avionics equipment now has A350-900 EASA Type Certificate Approval. To date over 2,000 pieces of equipment have been delivered.

Several technological leaps have been developed by Thales specifically for this platform.

To know more about what Frank Chapman, Airbus flight test chief pilot thinks about the A350-900 cockpit, see the video below.

Q&A with Xavier Labbé, head of the A350 XWB program at Thales

What are the main avionics innovations on board the A350-900?

I would go for three ones. The first is the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU): this is the first civil inertial unit that has been developed, certified and produced by Thales. The unit features state-of-the-art technologies and performs as expected with a remarkable level of accuracy and stability, thus contributing to the global performance of the aircraft’s air data chain.

The second would be the six large 15-inch displays. Once again this is the first time that such large screens have been installed in an Airbus cockpit. Other than the displays that are solely devoted to avionics information (navigation screen, primary flight displays, system information), these screens also provide information from the open world. Interactions with pilots and automatic reconfiguration enable perfect homogeneity between the different display systems onboard the whole Airbus range of aircraft. Qualifications for pilots are thus facilitated with the different models between the A320 and A350-900.

Another would be the Integrated Modular Avionics, or IMA. IMA has been first implemented on the A380 and the A400M, and embarks twice as many applications than previous generations, thus allowing reduced weight, enhanced performance and lower ownership costs for airlines. For the first time on the A350 XWB, remote data concentrator located near the sensors and the actuators, produced in partnership with Diehl Aerospace, enables the optimized processing of specific interfaces. Previously, each function was hosted by separate computers.

How did the program go with our customer, Airbus?

For the A350-900 program, Airbus implemented its “new system policy”, thus giving more responsibilities to its tier-1 suppliers.

Therefore we played a key role in advising for system pre-integration, on the inertial unit for instance. We were committed to achieving maturity for the first flight. After 15 months of flight tests, checking our equipment provided a means of confirming the high level of maturity which was attained more than one year before the certification of the aircraft. Early validations combined with a perfect collaboration with our customer in total transparency allowed us to achieve such results.

What are the next steps of the program for Thales?

The most important is to succeed in quickly ramping up production thanks to an industrial maturity aimed at ensuring quality and the on-time deliveries. We are also organized in order to provide Airbus’s first airline customer a flawless support for its operations, as early as the end of the year.

At the same time, we are continuing to work on complementary developments for the A350-1000, which will mainly be devoted to new add-on functionalities.

Finnair buys 8 more Airbus A350s in deal worth $2.3 billion - USA TODAY,"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTIvMDQvZmlubmFpci1idXlzLTgtbW9yZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MHMtaW4tZGVhbC13b3J0aC0yMy1iaWxsaW9uLzE5OTI3NDI3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Finnair buys 8 more Airbus A350s in deal worth $2.3 billion

Finnair announced on Wednesday that it will buy eight additional Airbus A350-900 jets from the European jetmaker. The deal would be valued at about $2.3 billion in list prices, though the large plane manufacturers typically offer substantial discounts to their airline customers.

Finnair was the first European carrier to place an order for the A350. Finnair placed that order in 2007 as part of a deal that included 11 firm orders with options for eight more. Wednesday's announcement firms up those options, a move that will give Finnair a total of 19 A350s.

The A350, of course, is the newest commercial passenger aircraft to be made by European jetmaker Airbus. It will be the first entirely new aircraft model to be rolled out by the world's two big jetmakers since Boeing delivered its first 787 ""Dreamliner"" in 2011. The A350, more than half of which will be made from carbon fibers, is set to be delivered to global launch customer Qatar Airways on Dec. 13.

As for Finnair, it plans to take delivery of the first of its 19 A350s in the fall of 2015, using the aircraft on its long-haul routes to Asia and North America.

""Our strategy centers on growth, taking advantage of the unique geographical location of our Helsinki Hub, which offers the fastest connections between Europe and Asia,"" Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo says in a statement. ""The A350XWB aircraft will be essential in delivering on our strategy, as they enable growth in both passenger and cargo traffic, offer our customers top class travel experience and considerably enhance our cost competitiveness.""

Finnair intends to use the two-engine A350 to help it phase out its aging four-engine A340s. Finnair hopes to retire its A340s by the end of 2017, with FlightGlobal.com adding Airbus has agreed to buy back four of Finnair's A340s as part of the order to firm up the options on the eight A350s.

Finnair will configure its A350s with 297 seats, including 46 in business class that will be arranged in a 1-2-1 layout with direct aisle access for each. Each seat converts to a full-flat bed and has a 16-inch touch-screen in-flight entertainment system in addition to AC and USB power outlets.

Seats in Finnair's main economy cabin will be arranged in a 3-3-3- layout. The Zodiac Z300 slim-line seats will have 31-inch seat pitch. At the front of its economy section, Finnair will offer 43 Economy Comfort seats that it says come with ""comfier headrests, high-quality headphones and four extra inches of leg room."" All of the coach seats on Finnair's A350s will have an 11-inch touch screen inflight entertainment system and USB power outlets."

Aiut Alpin Dolomites christens first Airbus Helicopters EC135 T3 - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWl1dGFscGluZG9sb21pdGVzY2hyaXN0ZW5zZmlyc3RhaXJidXNoZWxpY29wdGVyc2VjMTM1dDMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aiut Alpin Dolomites marked the entry into service of the Airbus Helicopters EC135 T3 on Dec. 9 in northern Italy. Andrew D. Parker Photos

There are few places in the world more scenic — and more challenging for helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) providers — than the Alps. Injuries that require a medical evacuation throughout the high altitude region, which stretches across parts of eight countries in Europe, are so time-critical that instead of airlifting a patient to a hospital, operators many times bring the necessary paramedics and equipment directly to the patient.

This is especially true in the Dolomites region in northeastern Italy, which houses a number of jagged snow-capped rock formations that are popular among climbers in the summer and skiers in the winter. It is also home to Aiut Alpin Dolomites, a nonprofit HEMS and search-and rescue operation nestled within the Dolomites mountain range. Representatives of the unit and Airbus Helicopters marked the entry-into-service of the first EC135 T3 on Dec. 9, in a ceremony complete with a demo flight, tours of the home base for Auit Alpin Dolomites and an Italian bishop blessing the aircraft.



The service entry ceremony included a mock demo of a rescue mission.

The unit is the launch operator for the type, which has two versions. The T3 is a variant with two Turbomeca Arrius 2B2 Plus engines and the P3 version features a pair of Pratt & Whitney PW206B3s. The P3 version is scheduled to enter service in early 2015.

Dr. Lydia Rauch, medical director for Aiut Alpin Dolomites, explained that the upgrade to the EC135 T3 was primarily due to new regulations put in place recently for European HEMS operators. The helicopter has a number of improvements that will increase the efficiency of rescue operations, including new radio and navigation techniques, new processes for winching, improved range and better hot-and-high performance. Medical tools on board include a defibrillator, suction equipment, respirator, oxygen bottles, emergency and pediatric backpacks, a vacuum mattress and a winch bag.



The main base of Aiut Alpin is situated within the Dolomites mountain range. Shown here is the new EC135 T3 on the helipad with the T2 version below.

Another advantage with the EC135 T3 is the ability to load the patient through the side door without having to land. “You put the winch down, perform all the medical needs for the patient, hook the patient back into the winch, and then one person — usually the doctor or mountain rescuer — can go with the patient up to the helicopter,” Rauch said. “In the air, we get in with the patient, close the door and go to the hospital. The usual procedure is that there has to be an intermediate landing to take in the patient.”



Winch and long rope operations are essential for Aiut Alpin Dolomites, which carries out missions in steep terrain.



According to Airbus Helicopters Germany CEO Wolfgang Schoder, the T3 version features a number of additional capabilities. Aiut Alpin currently operates an EC135 T2, which will eventually be transferred to another rescue operation and serve as a backup when needed.



“The first thing they told me today was now we can go on all those missions with high safety margins, including a full tank of fuel, as well as having all the doctors and medical equipment on board that we need, so that we don’t need to think about the performance of the helicopter. This is a big step forward for them,” Schoder told Vertical. In addition to a higher maximum takeoff weight of 2,980 kg (around 6,500 pounds) improvements include a newly designed multifunctional floor for air medial missions, removing the need for a second layer of flooring.



Teams from Aiut Alpin Dolomites (wearing orange, green and light blue jackets) and Airbus Helicopters (dark blue jackets) gather to mark the entry into service of the new EC135 variant.

The EC135 T2 and T3 are produced at the Airbus Helicopters plant in Donauwörth, Germany, along with the EC145 C2 and T2 variants, as well as the EC635 and EC645 (military versions of the EC135 and EC145, respectively). The plant also produces the Tiger attack helicopter and NH90, along with a CH-53 upgrade program for the German Army and composite doors for the fixed-wing A350 XWB airliner.

With origins tracing back to 1985, Aiut Alpin Dolomites consists of 17 mountain rescue groups, comprised of doctors, pilots, hoist operators and dog handlers. The unit first operated an Aérospatiale Alouette III, before transferring to various Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) Ecureuil variants — the AS350B, B1, B2 and B3 — through 2003. Since then, Aiut Alpin has operated the EC135, transitioning from the T1 to the T2 and T2i. The operation has responded to upwards of 700 calls in 2014 so far, and close to 13,000 emergency situations since opening its doors.

Qatar A350 Delivery Ceremony Review I - One Mile at a Time,"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlldy1vZi1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWNlcmVtb255L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday I had the amazing opportunity to visit the Airbus Delivery Center in Toulouse, France.

The occasion was to celebrate the delivery of the first Airbus A350 to Qatar Airways, which is the plane’s launch customer. There were about 150 media people invited from all over the world.

They really went over the top with the event, as I’ll cover in more detail below. There were two press dinners (neither of which I attended), an amazing ceremony, and a 45 minute media flight on the Airbus A350.

To start, here’s a short clip that Airbus made, with the highlights of the ceremony:

Or if you want to see the entire two hour press conference, here it is:

In the interest of full disclosure, Airbus covered the cost of my one night stay at the Radisson Blu Toulouse Airport. I paid for all my own transportation. Furthermore, to clarify, the invitation was from Airbus and not Qatar Airways (just so no one thinks I have an airline bias). Qatar Airways was the ultimate “guest” here. 😉

With that in mind, I figured I’d share my thoughts. One thing I love about blogging as opposed to “traditional” media is that I can share my unfiltered thoughts. I’m not here to rewrite any press releases, but rather to share my “fly on the wall” style impressions.

Well done, Airbus!

Airbus did an absolutely amazing job organizing this event. The day started with an hour press briefing, followed by an hour press conference, followed by an hour delivery ceremony, followed by a media flight on the A350.

Then there were several meals, coffee breaks, etc. The only one I partook in was the Arabic coffee and dates, courtesy of Qatar Airways. 😉

How over the top was the event? Well, during the delivery ceremony we had an Arabic opera singer, orchestra, and calligraphist, all “performing” at once.

Upon the conclusion of the last “performance” the curtains of the delivery center opened to reveal the gorgeous Qatar Airways A350 in the background. The setup was just brilliant — it was quite possibly the finest transition into airplane porn I’ve ever see.

Here’s the video of the musical performance:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D7sX1HNBV8?t=1h25m10s

So, what’s special about the Airbus A350?

While I’m passionate about commercial airplanes, a majority of my knowledge is specific to airlines and frequent flyer programs.

So for all intents and purposes, what makes the Airbus A350 unique? Well, obviously it’s intended to compete with the Boeing 787. What makes both of these planes so great are how low their operating costs are.

The Airbus A350 burns 25% less fuel than comparable previous generation planes. Fuel makes up roughly half of variable airline operating costs, so that’s basically like reducing variable operating costs by 12.5%. That’s huge.

Up until now I didn’t actually get the difference between the 787 and A350 from the airlines’ perspectives. What’s the difference, really, and why would airlines take delivery of both types of planes?

I didn’t realize that the sizes are substantially different. Boeing created the 787-8 and 787-9, while Airbus is creating the A350-900 and A350-1000.

The A350-900 is roughly comparable in size to the 787-9, while the A350-1000 is more of a 777 replacement.

I was surprised by how big the A350-900 was, and that’s the smaller of the two models that will be in production.

They also tout how it’s a much better ride from a passenger’s perspective, though I’ll share my thoughts on that below.

His Excellency Akbar Al Baker

Y’all know I kind of fanboy over His Excellency. I figured the guy was totally ridiculous, but I don’t think I was doing him justice.

The guy is quite possibly the most arrogant, opinionated, and unapproachable guy I’ve ever seen in my life.

It’s hilarious, the executives from Airbus were walking around and talking to people, and you wouldn’t even know who they were.

His Excellency always had at least a 20 person entourage. When they were setting up the press conference one of his handlers went to the stage to make sure that His Excellency’s table setup was acceptable.

During the photo op, someone from the press said “Mr. Al Baker, smile.” His response? “Not now.” ROFL!

I’ll share more about what he actually said below, but his demeanor was just off-the-charts.

All that being said, people loved it. The fact that he made himself so unapproachable made him all the more desirable. People barely snapped a picture of the Airbus CEO, while His Excellency had more pictures taken of him than One Direction at a concert.

Lastly, he has quite possibly the greatest smirk in the history of the world. When he gives an answer and thinks he’s funny/right, he has this absolutely brilliant smirk he lets off, which just can’t be described. Amazing.

Fascinating press conference/Q&A

The CEOs of Airbus, Rolls Royce, and Qatar Airways were on stage to share their excitement over the event and then answer questions. His Excellency struggled with reading his script, which is sort of incredulous given that he never actually looked up from his page.

Most fascinating had to be the dynamic between the Airbus CEO and His Excellency. They both threw some fabulous shade.

The Airbus CEO said “Akbar, you’re a difficult man to work with,” and said he likes having Qatar Airways as a launch customer, because if Qatar Airways is happy then all subsequent customers will be happy. Akbar had his own shade to throw.

His Excellency said they planned to fly the A350 basically everywhere, given that they have 80 of them on order. In the US, the immediate plans seem to be to fly them to the “eastern seaboard.”

He mentioned flying them to Europe. Someone asked about London specifically. His Excellency responded “is London not in Europe?”

As most of you probably remember, His Excellency’s fight with Airbus was the most exciting drama in the airline industry in 2014. Someone asked how the A380 is performing for Qatar Airways. His Excellency said the plane is performing better than expected, with 100% dispatch reliability (which isn’t really surprising, given how few they have).

He said they would consider ordering more after they’ve been flying them for at least 12 month.

One of the oddest things His Excellency said while basically talking how he runs the greatest freaking airline on earth is how Qatar Airways gets “more” out of their employees than other airlines. Um, yeah, so we’ve heard…

Flying the Airbus A350

As I said above, I was surprised by how big the A350 is. It’s huge, and feels much more like a 777 than an A330, for example.

The Qatar Airways A350 features the same business class product as they have on their A380s and 787s, which is a lovely reverse herringbone seat.

Economy is in a 3-3-3 configuration, with seats being 18” wide. Airbus explained that the plane was specifically designed so that it wouldn’t allow for 10 across seating, which should make it more comfortable from a passenger’s perspective.

I was seated in economy for the media flight, and I’ll be the first to admit I don’t have much to compare the seat to. 😉

But it was actually reasonably comfortable. Legroom was okay and the seats reclined a lot, which is a double edged sword – everyone likes reclining, but doesn’t like when the person in front of them reclines.

The entertainment screens were large, and there was nothing protruding legroom, which is great news.

The seatbelt sign screens are pretty cool, as they’re digital, so they show quite a bit of information.

The safety video was pleasant.

And the tail camera was awesome as well.

But there was nothing revolutionary about the product, in my opinion. And I wasn’t expecting anything revolutionary, though they tried to market it as such during the product briefing.

The plane is quiet, but then again so is the A380. And I don’t really see much difference between nine abreast seating on the A350 vs. 10 abreast seating on the A380. You still have sets of three seats by the windows, and what’s the difference between three and four seats in the middle section?

The media flight itself was pretty cool, though. They served Krug, finger sandwiches, and macarons.

Bottom line

From a passenger comfort standpoint I don’t really see the benefits of the A350 over the A380, 787, etc. There’s no denying that there’s a general trend towards quieter planes with better technology, but the A350 specifically isn’t revolutionary in that regard.

That being said, the reasons consumers (and airlines) should be excited about planes like the A350 is because of the lower operating costs.

Lower operating costs mean the possibilities for more frequencies and more new nonstop routes, which is great news for consumers. It also makes it easier for competitors to enter markets, which long term lowers airfare.

So we should all be excited about the A350. But not because it’s somehow going to feature flat beds in economy and showers and swimming pools in business class.

Thanks again to Airbus for the invite. This is a heck of a plane, and hopefully it doesn’t have the same “growing pains” that Boeing had with the 787."

Here’s a piece we did for CNN.com on the Year Ahead in Aviation for 2015.

Qatar gets first A350-900: Unless U-Turn Al U-Turns again, Qatar Airways

will take delivery of the world’s first Airbus A350-900 on Dec. 22. Reuters has a retrospective of the airplane’s development.

Update: The A350 got delivered, and Airbus says it won’t cancel the A380. Reuters has this report.

WTO Airbus-Boeing fight, continued: It never ends. As we reported Friday, the European Union filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over Washington State tax breaks extended to Boeing for the 777X. Long-time readers of this column know how we feel about the WTO generally and the trade dispute between Europe (Airbus) and the US (Boeing) specifically. We consider it all a waste of time and money.

Now that the EU has officially complained about the 777X tax breaks, we fully expect the US Trade Representative to officially file a counter-action against allegations Airbus is receiving illegal subsidies for the A350. During the height of the previous complaints, USTR and Boeing complained about launch aid provided for the A350. The EU said this aid complied with the findings and compliance requirements of the previous dispute. The USTR tried to wrap the A350 aid into the then-ongoing complaint, which was rejected by the WTO for procedural reasons.

Boeing’s statement Friday about the EU’s latest action cited the WTO’s rejection of including the 777X into the current appeals of the previous actions, suggesting this made the new complaint without merit. This is sophistry. Whether the 777X complaint has merit or not (we think it does), the inclusion was rejected for similar procedural reasons as the USTR effort to include the A350 issue: a new action was needed.

As we wrote at the time (and which is linked in Friday’s post), Boeing’s acceptance of tax breaks for the 777X is hypocrisy given its long-held position against Airbus tax breaks as outlined in the WTO complaint. The 777X tax breaks are extensions of the 787 tax breaks found by the WTO to be illegal.

Boeing has no basis on which to complain about the EU complaint. But it will, because this is how the game is played. And so look for a USTR action on the A350 launch aid.

A380, continued: The fascination over whether Airbus will proceed with a re-engining of the A380, and what engine will power a neo, continues. A suggestion that Engine Alliance could be a contender for the A380neo seem farfetched. Aviation Week’s Guy Norris has this analysis. In it, he notes that Pratt & Whitney and GE each doubt the business case for an A380neo. PW also told us when we were at its media day in May there was no business case. It’s also clear PW won’t go it alone with a big GTF: the CEO of parent United Technologies ruled out a big GTF two weeks into his tenure. Aviation Week previously reported Rolls-Royce and Airbus are close to an agreement to power the A380neo. We agree that RR will wind up with the business.

767-2C first flight: This is expected between Christmas and New Year’s. This has been widely viewed as a major milestone in the development of the Boeing KC-46A USAF aerial tanker, and it is important, but Boeing is downplaying it. There won’t be a a media event surrounding the flight. This will be saved for the first flight of an equipped tanker next year.

A320neo GTF engine certified: The US Federal Aviation Administration certified the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fan that will power the Airbus A320neo family last week.

Our Holiday schedule: We’ll be around and posting on a reduced schedule now through January 4. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Airbus delivers first A350 plane to Qatar - DW (English),"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtYTM1MC1wbGFuZS10by1xYXRhci9hLTE4MTQ2ODIy0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1hMzUwLXBsYW5lLXRvLXFhdGFyL2EtMTgxNDY4MjI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a move set to intensify competition with rival Boeing in the lucrative market for long-haul planes, Airbus on Monday delivered its first next-generation A350 jetliner to Qatar Airways.

The European airplane manufacturer hopes the A350 will allow it catch up in the market for long-haul, mid-sized planes dominated by rival Boeing's 777 and 787.

""Handing over the first A350 represents a significant step in Airbus and aviation history,"" Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier said at a ceremony in Toulouse, southern France. He added that Airbus was ""revolutionizing our industry and redefining the way people fly.""

Airbus overhauled the original design of the A350 to make it more fuel-efficient. The company says the plane consumes 25 percent less fuel when compared with older jets.

Airbus invested around $12-$15 billion (10-12 billion euros) in its strategy to position the A350 between the B777 and the 787. By the end of November, the company had won 778 orders for the aircraft from 41 customers worldwide, Airbus said.

Boeing, meanwhile, has received 1,055 orders for its Dreamliner aircraft, which was launched several years ago. Airlines are in the midst of a major push to modernize their fleets and benefit from the fuel savings offered by the latest generation of planes.

The first commercial flight of Qatar Airways' brand new aircraft is set to take place on January 15, from Doha to Frankfurt. Qatar Airways, owned by the energy-rich Gulf state, has ordered 80 of the planes, making it the largest single customer of the plane to date.

Qatar, rich in natural gas, is looking to transform itself into a major aviation hub in an attempt to develop new sources of income and reduce its dependence on natural resources.

"Airbus A380 Production Could End, And Why Emirates Is Pissed - One Mile at a Time","Thu, 11 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZW5kLWVtaXJhdGVzLXBpc3NlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From a passenger comfort standpoint, the Airbus A380 is my favorite plane in the sky. I’ve reviewed first class on every airline that operates the A380, and for the most part the experience is simply incomparable.

Qantas Airbus A380

The A380 is by far the quietest commercial aircraft in service, and also has some awesome amenities that most other planes don’t, from showers to onboard bars to double beds and fully enclosed suites.



Qatar Airways Airbus A380

However, it looks like the Airbus A380’s days may be numbered. It looks like by next year Airbus will have to decide whether they want to discontinue production of the A380 around 2018, or whether they want to invest an extra two billion Euros in the aircraft, without any guarantee of future return.

Via Bloomberg:

Airbus Group NV raised the prospect of discontinuing its A380 superjumbo as soon as 2018, the first admission that it may have misjudged the market for the double-decker after failing to find a single airline buyer this year. While Airbus will break even on the plane in 2015, 2016 and 2017, that outlook doesn’t hold for 2018, forcing the company to either offer new engines to make the A380 more attractive or discontinue the program, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told investors at a meeting in London today. In its seventh year in operation, the aircraft that cost $25 billion to develop threatens to become a costly misstep. While popular with travelers, most carriers prefer smaller twin-jet models that are more fuel efficient and can access more airports. Emirates is the only stand-out sponsor, having ordered 140 units, while other airlines have either backed off or are struggling to fill the two decks of the jumbo. … “Airbus will be obliged to make a decision one way or the other in 2015,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris, who estimates an engine upgrade may cost Airbus 2 billion euros ($2.47 billion) because of work required on the wing.



Singapore Airlines A380

The A380 doesn’t offer a unique value proposition for the airlines

As much as I love flying the A380, it’s no surprise that the plane isn’t doing very well.

On a per passenger basis there are much more fuel efficient widebody twin-engine aircraft which have a similar range. From an airline’s perspective, why would they pay more to have less flexibility?

Not only does the 787 have a lower per passenger operating cost, but it allows airlines to fly in markets where a 500+ seat plane might not be able to succeed. It’s much easier to maximize yields on a plane with ~200 seats than in a plane with ~500 seats.

So while we like it as customers, that’s sort of where the benefits end.



Qatar Airways 787

Why Emirates is angry about this

The one airline which can’t get enough of the A380 is Emirates, as they have a total of 140 of them ordered, which represents about 40% of the total A380s on order. Their CEO, Tim Clark, is miffed at the prospect of the plane being discontinued. Via CNN Money:

“We are on the hook for this plane,” said Emirates President Tim Clark. “I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake,” he told Reuters.

And Emirates’ frustration at the prospect of the plane being discontinued is well founded. If the plane is discontinued rather than improved, they won’t have anything to replace it with, and there aren’t really any comparable plans in development.

The reason the A380 works so well for Emirates is because their business model centers around offering passengers one stop service between major cities in the world that can’t typically be reached nonstop, via Dubai. They largely operate in super-mega-ultra-dense markets.

For example, Emirates operates eight flights a day between Dubai and London, six of which are operated by A380s. Heathrow is heavily slot restricted, so if it weren’t for the A380 they couldn’t fly nearly as many passengers between the two cities.

Similarly, they operate two nonstop A380 flights every day between Dubai and Sydney, one A380 flight with their joint venture partner Qantas, and one 777-300ER one-stop flight going via Bangkok. The same is true for Melbourne.

But Emirates is unique. Really unique. And that model doesn’t work for most other airlines, as they don’t operate a handful of whalejets in a single market each day.



Emirates A380

Bottom line

As much as the thought pains me, my money is on A380 production being discontinued in 2018. (Update: A380 production was ultimately discontinued, with Airbus claiming the A380 program was a success, despite billion-dollar losses).

While Emirates can’t get enough of them, it doesn’t really seem like any other airline is thrilled with them, as it stands.

What do you think? Are the A380’s days numbered?"

Airbus Helicopters is working together with helicopter operators to develop a Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) for EC225 aircraft that are utilized for oil and gas missions, marking the first such source document created in the rotorcraft sector, and further reinforcing the company’s safety initiatives in cooperation with operators and industry stakeholders.

This initial source document incorporates aircraft manufacturer guidance for enhanced operational safety during routine situations, as well as increased efficiency; and it will be further developed to include abnormal situations.

Topics covered by the EC225 FCOM include procedures for operating state-of-the-art glass cockpits, a focus on automated systems, and guidance on work-share among pilots – also known as Crew Resource Management (CRM).

“The FCOM is a joint initiative between Airbus Helicopters and some offshore operators to better meet users’ needs, providing an information source that contributes to standardized operations in the offshore sector, with the ultimate goal of increasing safety throughout the industry,” explained Gilles Bruniaux, Airbus Helicopters vice president of aviation safety. “We are proud to be the first in offering such a resource to our customers, some of whom played an integral role in outlining this FCOM for these specific operations.”

Gretchen Haskins, CEO of global offshore helicopter safety trade association HeliOffshore welcomed the new manual: “We applaud these initial steps by Airbus Helicopters on this important safety information and look forward to supporting the further development of the FCOM. Working together, we can help ensure best practice is available and being used to achieve the highest standards of safety for the passengers and crew who fly offshore.”

The initial FCOM issue will be followed by updates to expand the content, and additional manuals are planned for other Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft deployed in oil and gas missions – including the new EC175.

Availability of the EC225’s FCOM is via Airbus Helicopters’ e-TechPub (Customer Portal), and is being offered free of charge through 2015."
A380’s failure to take off puts future of the ‘queen of the skies’ in doubt - The Guardian,"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0L2RlYy8yOC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mdXR1cmUtaW4tZG91YnTSAUxodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNC9kZWMvMjgvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZnV0dXJlLWluLWRvdWJ0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tom Enders stared at the phone on his desk as it began to ring. The Airbus boss had been expecting a call to his office in Toulouse. It was Tim Clark, chief executive of Dubai-based airline Emirates, the biggest buyer of the planemaker’s A380 “superjumbo”.

Clark was angry. He wanted to know why Airbus finance director Harald Wilhelm had just raised the prospect of the death of the A380.

The aircraft cost $25bn (£16bn) to develop, but it has struggled to chalk up the large orders Airbus had envisioned, at $440m each. So far, it has just 318 orders, compared with the 1,200 that Airbus thought airlines needed in that size category – it carries around 550 passengers – when it began marketing in 2000.

Wilhelm sparked panic among Airbus customers and shareholders when he told analysts it would break even on the aircraft up until 2018, “if we would do something on the product, or even if we would discontinue the product”.

The indiscretion let slip an internal debate at Airbus about the future of the world’s largest jetliner. However, it was the first time the Franco-German manufacturer had publicly admitted it was contemplating pulling the rug on the programme. “I am not particularly happy, as you can imagine,” Clark fumed. “We are on the hook for this plane. I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake.”

Emirates has 55 of the giant planes in service and has placed orders for a further 85. The carrier accounts for 40% of the total orders for the aircraft, so any squeak from Clark will reverberate around Toulouse.

Airbus has attempted to soothe fears about killing off its marquee plane by saying it was more likely to modify the aircraft and launch a model with more fuel-efficient engines, known as the A380Neo (new engine option), or a bigger “stretch” version.

“The entire Airbus top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects for the A380, but any investment requires a sound business case, which we will continue to study.”

Clark said if Airbus did press ahead with the engine upgrade, which could improve fuel efficiency by up to 15%, Emirates would eventually replace all 140 of its superjumbos with the upgraded version.

Since the plane’s first commercial flight with Singapore Airlines in 2007, Airbus has struggled to sell the A380. The global economic downturn hit airlines hard, forcing many out of business. Those that survived have turned to using smaller, twin-jet models that are more fuel efficient and can fly to more airports.

One industry source said: “We still haven’t come out of recession and for companies to put major assets like this on the balance sheet is a big ask.”

The A380 works best when flown on popular routes, or from capacity-constrained airports, such as Heathrow. But many airlines have struggled to make the investment profitable.

Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of Air France-KLM, aims to cancel the last two of a dozen A380s the airline has on order and swap them for smaller models. He said recently: “It’s an excellent plane but it only works for the right destinations.”

This year looks like it will be the first since the A380 entered service without a new airline customer. The only buyer has been a leasing company that has yet to line up a single carrier to take any of the 20 planes it ordered.

James Hogan, chief executive of Etihad, this month ruled out further A380 purchases as he took delivery of the airline’s first “superjumbo”. His frank assessment that Etihad would not be affected by the ending of A380 production added weight to fears that Airbus has struggled to find any more buyers.

Hogan said: “When you are taking 10 aircraft, whether Airbus continues the production line or not isn’t an issue.”

Airbus is suing Japan’s Skymark Airlines after cancelling an order for six A380s amid fears that it would not receive payment from the airline, while Virgin Atlantic and Air Austral are among the carriers increasingly unlikely to proceed with orders.

Clark is baffled by the way rival airlines use the A380, noting the odd seating configurations that some use.

Emirates is using the plane as its main jet because air travel is forecast to double in the next 10 years to 7bn passengers annually. So it is convinced that airports and airlines will need huge jets like the A380 to cope with the surge in demand.

“It’s a great aircraft,” Clark told Airlineratings.com. “If airlines don’t believe they can fill an A380, their business model is wrong.”

He said if a new model was built it would be as economical to fly as the Boeing 777X long-haul jet, which is being introduced in 2018. “We will buy 140 of the A380Neos,” he said. “As long as I am around, I am going to continue to fight the battle for the A380. The world needs [this aircraft].”

He described the plane as a “passenger magnet” and reckons the five that Emirates operates each day between Dubai and Heathrow are 95% full.

While the Dubai carrier is loath to see the A380 cancelled, perhaps even more is at stake for Britain’s economy. Any move to kill off the “queen of the skies” is sure to cause anguish at Airbus’s two main British plants. All of the wings for its planes are designed in Filton, Bristol, and assembled at Broughton in north Wales.

Broughton’s new north factory is one of the biggest in Britain and contains a huge, automated rivet gun which is five storeys high. It takes this giant industrial stapler 10 days to punch 750,000 rivets into precise locations on both wings. It would take more than a month for two teams of 20 people on each wing to do the same job.

The wings are the most complicated and most important part of the plane and there are thousands of well-paid, highly skilled British jobs that rely on the work. “There’s a lot hanging on the future of this programme for Britain,” an industry source said.

However, insiders suggested that Wilhelm’s gaffe and Clark’s angry response had refocused Airbus’s top team on sorting out the A380, which may give the programme a shot in the arm.

The Emirates chief urged the manufacturer to step up its A380 marketing efforts. He also criticised Airbus for focusing too heavily on an upgrade of its best-selling A320 short-haul plane.

“What is happening over there?” he fumed. “I would like a first-hand understanding on where it is going.”

Whatever Airbus decides, some believe the A380 is already destined for the history books.

Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at Teal Group and a long-time critic of the giant jetliner, said the fresh crop of wide bodied, twin-engine planes coming to the market signalled the death of the A380.

“I don’t think it will last for more than a few years into the next decade,” Aboulafia said. “The quicker Airbus lets go, the quicker it can devote its marketing efforts to other products.”

Airbus Captures Five $300M A350 Jetliners Flying Together In This Billion-Dollar Photo Shoot - PetaPixel,"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vcGV0YXBpeGVsLmNvbS8yMDE0LzEyLzAzL2FpcmJ1cy1zaG93cy1vZmYtZml2ZS1vZi1pdHMtMzAwbS1hMzUwLWpldGxpbmVycy1pbi10aGlzLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLXBob3Rvc2hvb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This September, Airbus took to the skies to capture photos of five of its massive test and development A350–900s. The photo shoot was meant to celebrate the certification of the company’s latest twin-engine, wide-body jetliner.

It was also probably one of the most expensive photo shoots we’ve ever come across.

At a cool $300 million for each of the five A350–900s, the cost of the subjects alone totals $1.5 billion dollars. Initial capital aside though, the cost to actually perform the shoot is equally nauseating for us plebs.

According to information we dug up in the A350–900 specifications, just one of these flagship jetliners is capable of consuming 3,500 gallons of fuel per hour of flight time. Multiply that by $3.00 (the going price of jet fuel) and you have a price tag of just over $11,000.

That’s for only one plane though. There were five of them in this shoot, bringing the bill up to $55,000. Include the cost of preparation, pilots, the cost to fuel and operate the two chase planes, and you’re well on your way to a photo shoot that cost around $75,000 for operation alone.

These numbers are skewed a bit, considering the airliners aren’t full of passengers and we can’t know for sure how much the pilots and staff are being paid, but they’re probably not far off in a back-of-the-napkin math sort of way.

Don’t take our tallying the price tag as a sign of criticism though. The result… well… it speaks for itself.

Watching these quarter of a million-pound beasts effortlessly maneuver so close to one another and in such synchronization is mesmerizing. Throughout the six and a half minute BTS video, we see them pull off a handful of impressive formations, complete with the pilots’ reactions.

They might not be as agile as the Blue Angels, but we’d be wrong to say they aren’t as graceful. Press play and enjoy as over a billion dollars in machinery pulls off one heck of a photo shoot."
Qatar Airways Takes Delivery of the First Airbus A350 - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways, to much fanfare, took delivery today of the first commercial A350-900. Not only is this the first serial production A350 to be delivered to a customer, it is also the first of 80 A350s headed for Qatar Airways. Qatar has 36 additional -900s on order as well as 43 -1000s.

The A350 itself represents a technological leap for Airbus, as it is their first aircraft to be over 50% composite materials; 53%, technically – including the longest manufactured single pieces of carbon fiber that make up the wing assembly. The remainder of the aircraft is made up of modern metallurgical feats that manifest themselves as lighter titanium and aluminum alloys.

BONUS: OMG YES! Photos & Video of Five Airbus A350s Flying in Formation

If that wasn’t enough to impress you, the A350 is the first aircraft certified by the EASA to operate ETOPS 370 missions prior to entry-into-service (EIS). ETOPS 370 is the next phase of Extended-range Twin Operations, allowing an aircraft to be certified to fly on one engine for more than six hours. This opens up a whole host of new destinations for twin-engine aircraft, as well as adds efficiencies to existing air routes as airlines will no longer have to “hug” strategic alternate airports as tightly.

From a passenger perspective, the A350 represents a step up from previous Airbuses as well, featuring similar technology seen on the Boeing 787. The cabin is more humid, better lit, and obscenely quiet.

BONUS: Photos- Airbus A350-900 XWB Has Successful First Flight

In the case of Qatar Airways, their A350-900s will feature 36 business class seats with an 80″ bed and 17″ HD IFE system. There is also an in-flight bar. Economy will be 18″ wide seats with a traditional 3-3-3 layout. IFE will feature a 10.6″ screen.

This is an aircraft so fantastic that when Rolls Royce held a parade for the first production Trent XWB engine, 6,000 people came out.

Okay, enough with the facts: time to get to the fun stuff – time with the actual aircraft and the delivery ceremony!

There was some controversy with the delivery, since it was supposed to happen earlier in the month. That said, we now know that the A350 delivery was not delayed because of anything Airbus did. It was delayed because of some issues with a buyer-furnished-equipment supplier. Even then, it was still – technically – delivered ahead of schedule.

There was a brief press conference, where the EIS date for Qatar’s A350 was reaffirmed as January 15, 2015 (to Frankfurt). We also learned that Qatar Airways will likely be sending it to St. Petersburg at some point. Curiously, there was discussion of bringing the aircraft into Heathrow – but it was not elaborated upon. Best of all during the press conference was Akbar Al Baker’s statement that numerous airlines around the world could be offering products as high-quality and class-leading as Qatar Airways – but instead choose to rely on protectionism to swindle their customers (paraphrasing, of course).

I am not sure what airlines he had in mind when he said that, but I will hazard a guess and say “all of them”. Regarding the protectionism, we can assume that he is talking about airlines from a select few Northern Hemisphere countries that see the Gulf Carriers (such as Qatar, Etihad, and Emirates) not as competition- but as existential threats.

After the speeches concluded, it was time for an art and trophy exchange. It seems, unlike Boeing, Airbus prefers sculpture to a set of symbolic keys.

The A350-900 boasts a ridiculously low fuel-burn per seat. Allegedly, lower than the 787-9. This feat was so noteworthy that it demanded a performance by the Toulouse Chamber Orchestra. Okay, maybe that’s not why they performed – but that makes a lot more sense for the narrative.

When MSN006 arrives in Doha, there will be another ceremony in early January. Eight days after that, it will enter into service. We will be there to enjoy in the festivities.

For those of us that live in America, we can probably expect to see Qatar Airways A350s showing up on the “eastern seaboard” some time in 2015.

As part of the media event, we were given a special 45-minute flight around Toulouse to check out the new aircraft. I will be sharing my experience, photos, and thoughts in a future story on that flight.

Airbus provided flights and accommodation for us to cover this story. Opinions are our own.

Q&A with Airbus Helicopters Germany CEO Wolfgang Schoder - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcWF3aXRoYWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcHRlcnNnZXJtYW55Y2Vvd29sZmdhbmdzY2hvZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters Germany CEO Wolfgang Schoder with the EC135 T3.

During a visit to Italy for the entry-into-service of the first EC135 T3 with Aiut Alpin Dolomites, Vertical sat down with Dr. Wolfgang Schoder, chief executive officer of Airbus Helicopters Germany, as well as executive vice president of light and governmental programs for parent Airbus Helicopters. The CEO talked about production goals at the Donauwörth facility, which builds the EC135 T2 and T3 along with the EC145 C2 and T2 variants, as well as the EC635 and EC645 (military versions of the EC135 and EC145, respectively). The plant also produces the Tiger attack helicopter and NH90, along with a CH-53 upgrade program, maintenance for Sea King and Sea Lynx for the German Armed Forces and doors for the fixed-wing A350 XWB or A380 airliners.

Vertical: What is the delivery schedule for the EC135 T3 and P3 variants?

Schoder: In the beginning of 2015, we will deliver the first P3 version of the EC135, with Pratt & Whitney PW206B3 engines, to ADAC, the biggest German air rescue operator. And we have further contracts with French operators. We will deliver around about 40 to 50 per year. This is our normal production rate.

Vertical: What about the EC145 T2?

Schoder: For the EC145, I cannot give a flat number at this time, but it will increase as we move forward. The rate is more limited by production.

Vertical: What does working with two engine types involve?

Schoder: It was the setup from the very beginning of this helicopter. There are advantages — giving the customer a choice, and there’s a mature supply chain when you have very high production rates. Then there are disadvantages. The effort for certifying the helicopter is nearly double.

Vertical: What applications is Airbus Helicopters targeting with the new versions of the EC135 and EC145?

Schoder: The market segments are not so different from the ones we’ve targeted already. We just want to serve them better. For the T3/P3, it will be search-and-rescue, and in this area, more performance means more safety. We’ll target parapublic/police, and VIP transport is now more attractive. Both helicopters will address the same segments, but we think they will be more successful.

Vertical: What are the safety benefits of the upgraded variants?

Schoder: The first is the one engine inoperative capabilities, for starting up, landing and moving over dangerous areas. Both helicopters will have a cockpit mission system, which shows everything that’s happening in the cockpit, and that’s very important for pilot training, accident investigation, and so on. In terms of crashworthiness, we are a leader with our composite airframe. Crashworthy fuel tanks, crashworthy seats — this is a standard in Airbus Helicopters. We will not deliver anything else.

Vertical: With the brand change from Eurocopter to Airbus Helicopters in January 2014, how does Airbus Helicopters Germany fit into the larger organization?

Schoder: Airbus is really a big brand, and we are proud that our helicopters are now flying under that name, and we perceive that as well from customer feedback. Of course, Eurocopter was a good brand as well, and even if internally our people need some time to change and adapt to that, all of them are very proud. Everybody loves Airbus — even if still, from time to time, when I speak in a different language, I might say Eurocopter instead of Airbus Helicopters. Otherwise this transformation to the new name and company was very smooth.

Vertical: What will happen with the EC designators?

Schoder: Something will come up. Wait a few weeks.





Wolfgang Schoder during the entry into service ceremony for the EC135 T3 with Aiut Alpin Dolomites.

Vertical: Where do you see global growth opportunities?

Schoder: We see a lot of growth potential in Asia, including China. We’ve sold the first EMS helicopter to China and India as well, so we are in the pole position for those two countries, and the growth potential is huge. It’s important to be there when the infrastructure is developing.

Vertical: What’s the latest on Helionix?

Schoder: The first system was certified at the beginning of this year, and delivered in July on the EC145 T2, and now the next helicopter variant to receive the system is the EC175. It’s a great success, even though I have to admit — yes, it is quite a challenge to develop an avionics system with such a large software package. We had high ambitions, and wanted to come up with something that really offers benefits to the pilot. Pilots have been giving us feedback from the first operations, and they are really enthusiastic about it. One very important thing is the philosophy of Helionix — only those indications that the pilot needs in that moment of the flight are displayed. So the pilot only sees what is absolutely needed to fly, or, if there is a problem with the system, it is indicated. If there’s no problem, you do not see it. It’s a very easy-to-read display, and easy-to function cockpit.

Vertical: What benefits can be achieved by using a civil platform such as the EC145 T2 to develop a military variant EC645 T2?

Schoder: There are many benefits. First, the EC145 T2 is a very powerful helicopter. So it’s natural to take a powerful platform and transfer it to military applications. The cabin size is perfect for a light utility helicopter. It’s much cheaper to start with a commercial platform and then militarize it. What results is a much less expensive development and certification process, and then you just add the military certification or base the military certification on the civil one.

Vertical: How does this compare to a military development program such as the NH90?

Schoder: It’s not fair to compare an EC645 T2 to an NH90. The NH-90 is a much more capable and complex system. It’s a weapons system, not just a helicopter. Military forces should think about which missions they could use such militarized platforms. For some missions, you need the full complex NH-90. For simple missions, a light utility helicopter can do the same. Then it’s much cheaper.

Vertical: How will lower fuel prices affect the civil helicopter markets?

Schoder: It’s difficult to perceive. But of course, if oil price were to stay at that level for several years, it would have an impact on the oil and gas industry. It’s too early to forecast that now.

Vertical: Will Donauwörth get involved with any further fixed-wing projects outside of the A380 or A350 XWB composite doors?

Schoder: The helicopters business is our main business. The reason why we produce doors in Donauwörth is more historical. It comes out of our past development. It’s an important business, but not a core business. There is no intention to extend that cooperation with Airbus on fixed-wing projects, or grow that partnership."

The Oklahoma City Police Department’s Aviation Unit has put two new Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3e AStar helicopters into service as part of a fleet upgrade plan. The new helicopters, delivered by Airbus Helicopters Inc., of Grand Prairie, Texas, include technological and equipment upgrades that will enable the department to significantly improve its airborne law enforcement and public safety mission capabilities.

The new helicopters were displayed at an event in Oklahoma City, along with an AS350 B3e recently delivered to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and a recently delivered AS350 B2 from the Tulsa Police Department. Oklahoma City ordered the two AS350 B3e helicopters in 2013 to replace its current fleet of patrol helicopters and increase the types of missions the aviation unit’s aircraft can perform.

“Across the State of Oklahoma, law enforcement agencies have chosen the Airbus Helicopters AStar to upgrade from aging and less capable aircraft,” said Ed Van Winkle, sales manager for airborne law enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “The multi-mission capability of the AS350-series helicopters, combined with additional safety features and low operating costs, make them the right choice for law enforcement agencies to upgrade their helicopter fleets.”

Oklahoma City police are excited to have the new, more capable helicopters. “The Oklahoma City Police Department has upgraded our ability to provide better public safety coverage for a city that spans 621 square miles with the addition of these helicopters,” said Chief of Police William Citty. “The successful process of transitioning to a helicopter that allows for greater functionality, safety and reduced pilot fatigue is a testimony to Airbus Helicopters and their product. And our pilots … let’s say they are not unhappy.”

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol put its AS350 B3e into service in May and the Tulsa Police Department put its AS350 B2 into service in August. In addition to purchasing new helicopters, the Oklahoma law enforcement agencies upgraded to modern avionics and mission equipment to enhance the performance and capabilities of their aviation units. Oklahoma City’s new helicopters are well suited to tactical team insertions and are equipped with cargo hooks, allowing them to carry “Bambi Buckets” for firefighting.

The new Oklahoma City AStars are equipped with an avionics and mission equipment suite that enhances crew safety and law enforcement operational capabilities. This suite includes the Garmin G500H electronic flight information system, FLIR Systems 8500 thermal imager, Spectrolab SX-16 searchlight and the Aerocomputers UC-5100 moving map system.

Airbus Helicopters’ AS350 series are the most widely purchased helicopters by U.S. law enforcement agencies. More than 220 are in use nationwide with 44 different law enforcement agencies, 75 of them delivered in the last five years. AStars are known for their performance, reliability and multi-mission flexibility. They are powered by Turbomeca Arriel engines that deliver high cruise speed and reliability, along with low direct operating costs.

Other law enforcement agencies that have recently purchased AS350 B3e AStars include the California Highway Patrol, Mississippi Department of Public Safety, and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department."

Airbus Helicopters Photo

Saft is supplying the on-board batteries for Airbus Helicopters’ twin-turbine EC175 helicopter that has entered series production with the first delivery on Dec. 11 to Belgian operator NHV. Two Saft Ultra Low Maintenance (ULM) rechargeable nickel-based batteries are being fitted to each EC175 helicopter to provide emergency back-up power, as well as starting power for the APU (auxiliary power unit).

The new EC175 medium twin-turbine helicopter fits between the Airbus Helicopters EC155 and EC225 ranges, with 16 passenger capacity, 5 blade main-rotor and a 140 knots cruise speed, it is primarily designed for three types of operations: offshore, SAR (search-and-rescue) and VIP transport.

Helicopter applications are especially demanding for the on-board batteries due to the harsh vibrations and extreme temperatures.

This operating environment becomes even more demanding for SAR deployment as life-saving missions can require the aircraft to fly in severe weather conditions. Saft has worked in close cooperation with the Airbus Helicopters program teams since the beginning of the project to design a custom engineered battery system for the prototype EC175, progressing through qualification and certification milestones in 2012 and now into serial production. The ULM battery technology was selected as it offers the ideal combination of high performance, low weight and ultra-low maintenance requirements to enable significant reductions in the total cost of ownership (TCO) and operations for helicopter batteries.

“The EC175 program has strengthened the long-standing partnership between Saft and Airbus Helicopters that has previously seen our batteries deployed successfully on helicopters such as the AS350, the EC135 and EC145. It is also reinforcing ULM technology as the standard for nickel-based aviation batteries,” says Antoine Brenier, Saft Aviation, international sales and marketing director.

Two Saft batteries are being fitted to each EC175 version to provide total system redundancy. The 275CH3 battery comprises 20 Saft CVH27 cells, providing a nominal 24 V and 27 Ah capacity at a total weight of just 26.5 kg."

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Ten years ago, the boss of Qatar Airways, who takes his first new A350 jet this week, warned Airbus it was flying off course.

Boeing was knocking on his door with a ""super-efficient"" jet boasting 30 percent fuel savings thanks to a carbon-composite design.

In Toulouse, some Airbus engineers, riding high after overtaking Boeing and suspecting a short-lived marketing stunt, laughed off the future 787 with a “tail like a dolphin”.

Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker urged Airbus to take the 787 seriously and said its draft response, a quick fix to its A330 with new General Electric engines, was inadequate.

As Qatar Airways planned for rapid regional and long-haul

growth, Al Baker recalls, ""there was a requirement for an aircraft that has capacity that is optimal on two fronts: customer comfort and technologically forward-thinking"".

That clamor for both cabin comfort and better economics eventually forced Airbus into a fundamental shift in strategy.

But after Al Baker's warning, it took another two years of sales setbacks and doubts at the highest management level before Airbus agreed to build the A350XWB to be delivered on Monday.

That story is revealed here after interviews with customers, suppliers and industry sources. Airbus declined comment.

The fluctuating, decade-long journey from half-hearted tinkering to an all-new family of jets highlights a chess game still being played out as Airbus and Boeing battle each other in the wide-body market, valued at $1.9 trillion over 20 years.

Next month, the A350 will start competing with the 787 in the skies, having garnered 778 orders against 1,055 for the 787.

To build the carbon-plastic jets, planemakers have tested themselves to the limit. But they have also carefully avoided a head-on collision, searching for pockets of empty space in the twinjet market by unveiling variants that rarely have precisely the same capacity as their competitor's.

Some analysts say that may help support their profit margins, though as the A350's story demonstrates, competition for sales is intense.

Story continues

""I think they are now pretty well matched,"" said Steven Udvar-Hazy, who as CEO of lessor ILFC at the time was the world's biggest buyer of commercial jets and would prove to be an important influence on the A350s development.

DEFENSIVE RESPONSE

A decade ago, air travel was changing. Planes with two engines were able to fly further, and proving more efficient than big jets with four engines.

Boeing's twin-engine 777 was beating Airbus's four-engine A340 in the market for big planes, and Airbus's huge four-engine A380, the biggest airliner ever, had yet to enter service.

Airbus was strong in the market for small wide-body jets, doing well with its twin-engine A330. But fast-growing airlines like Qatar and Emirates were demanding more comfortable cabins with space to install new lie-flat beds.

That might have suggested a new fuselage, a decision planemakers rarely take more than once every couple of decades.

But Airbus was behind in new materials technology, focused on finishing the A380, and hoarding resources to improve its most profitable cash cow, the A320 small jet, in case Boeing refreshed its 737 model, people familiar with the matter said.

When Boeing launched the medium-sized 787 to compete with the A330, Airbus responded defensively. It's answer, the A350, was basically an A330 with carbon wings and new engines, rather than a new plane.

""People were cringing at the time, saying it was inelegant or ‘how can you put a patch on a broken leg',"" said Henri Courpron, chairman of Plane View Partners and former head of Airbus North America.

Soon, Airbus customers in Boeing's backyard, like Northwest Airlines and Air Canada, were writing checks for 787s. Airbus found itself straining to compete with both flagship Boeings.

In December 2005, pressure reached boiling point with two big Boeing wins. Qantas chose the 787; Cathay Pacific picked the 777.

An internal post-mortem on Qantas laid out the problem: the original A350 was ""reactionary"" and Airbus had lost credibility.

Airbus Chief Executive Gustav Humbert called in his 43-year-old strategy chief Olivier Andries and gave him a delicate task.

""I asked him to take the best guys and set up a long-range policy team,"" Humbert, who is now retired, told Reuters.

Humbert urged him to consider whether Airbus could capture 50 percent of the big-jet market, up from 35-40 percent, by straddling the largest 787 and smallest 777: around 300 seats.

""I was encouraged to think outside the box ....about the whole long-range strategy,"" said Andries, now chief executive of engine firm Turbomeca. He declined to discuss details.

Monitored by a team of retired ""Wise Men,"" the group of 10 drew up confidential scenarios from makeovers to bold new jets.

In March 2006, Udvar-Hazy, who now runs Air Lease, piled on pressure by urging Airbus to drop its cautious A350.

""We looked at the economics and concluded it was not a contender in a meaningful way. So I felt it would get a silver medal and didn’t deserve to get built,"" Udvar-Hazy told Reuters.

In Toulouse, it was proving hard to make the business cases stick, but one proposal labeled ""1d"" looked promising.

It dived deep into a planemaker's armory of wings, cockpit, cabin, engines and the all-important wider fuselage.

It would cost about 11 billion euros to build rather than the 4 billion budgeted for the original A350, while setting Airbus up for 20 years with projected sales of 2,000 planes instead of 800. But it was still a step behind Boeing's 787: the tube would be in metal rather than carbon.

ABBEY RETREAT

Meanwhile, an internal crisis cast a new shadow over the proposals.

Delays to the A380 hit share prices in June 2006 and forced Humbert to resign. The Farnborough Airshow was looming and a divided board was not ready to commit to a new project.

“No decision was taken to discontinue the original A350,"" Andries said. ""Most senior executives at the time were against the Extra-Wide Body. Even in the summer of 2006 the decision was not secure.""

Airbus nonetheless took the risk of presenting the concept at the July 2006 show. Even as it called the plane a ""step ahead of the 787"" it made little reference to the metal shell.

Humbert's replacement, aerospace outsider Christian Streiff, took top Airbus managers to a converted French abbey to reflect.

Over dinner, according to a person familiar with the event, he asked them to raise their hands if they thought Airbus should build the very plane they had publicized weeks earlier. Only a handful did, including sales chief John Leahy and Andries.

Nevertheless, the engineers pressed on. Soon, they came up with a cost-effective way to make an all-carbon body assembled from panels, which they felt would be cheaper to build than the single giant piece in the Boeing 787.

In December, 2006, the reversal was complete: the board approved the new, all-carbon A350XWB.

Meanwhile, the battle of the air goes on. Whether Airbus can meet Humbert's challenge of 50 percent wide-body market share depends partly on the success of Boeing's latest move - a larger and upgraded 777, Udvar-Hazy said.

The answer may lie in a drawer in Toulouse. Industry sources say Humbert's planners drew up, but discarded, a variant for a larger version of its new jet called A350-1100. That could provide a clue to Airbus's options next decade.

A double-handover ceremony has marked Airbus Helicopters’ first deliveries of its new-generation EC175, with two of these seven-metric-ton category rotorcraft provided to NHV for oil and gas missions in the North Sea.

The milestone EC175s will be utilized on core applications for which Airbus Helicopters developed this medium-sized rotorcraft: the airlift of crews and supplies to oil and gas platforms at sea, along with search and rescue in support of such off-shore operations.

Airbus Helicopters designed the EC175 to meet evolving mission needs in the oil and gas industry, offering outstanding performance and unmatched cost efficiency – with the capability of carrying a full payload to 90 percent of the North Sea’s offshore installations.

“Today is a very special day for all of us. The delivery of this first EC175 is indeed a key milestone for NHV, for our customer community and for our company”, said Airbus Helicopters president Guillaume Faury.

A total of 16 EC175s have been ordered by NHV in its strategy of owning a young, modern fleet. NHV will begin EC175 service this month from the Dutch North Sea base of Den Helder.

“We are proud to be the EC175’s first operator, continuing a long partnership with Airbus Helicopters that began in 1997 with a Dauphin rotorcraft, and which now includes Super Puma AS332 L2, EC155 B1 and EC145 helicopters,” explained Eric Van Hal, the CEO of NHV. “Our EC175s are joining an industry-leading fleet of Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft that was expanded through the announcement of our merger this year with Blueway.”

The EC175 is certified to the latest airworthiness standards, covering both the helicopter and its new Helionix avionics suite – providing increased safety through reduced pilot workload, enhanced situational awareness, improved flight envelope protection and system redundancy.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada’s latest PT6 turboshaft engine version – the PT6-C67E, which was developed specifically for this helicopter – the EC175 has become the industry’s benchmark medium-sized twin-engine rotorcraft across a full range of missions, including airlift duties in oil and gas operators, search and rescue, emergency medical services, public services, VIP and executive transport.

Contributing to the EC175’s competitive edge is its recommended cruise speed of 150 kts., while the maximum cruise speed exceeds 165 kts. – all achieved at extremely low vibration levels.

Excellent power performance for the EC175 includes hover out of ground effect (HOGE) with a maximum 7.5-metric-ton take-off weight at 5,800 ft. at ISA+20°C conditions; one engine inoperative (OEI) hover performance, which ensures safety during hoisting for search and rescue missions; and extensive power reserve ensuring heli-deck performance (PC1) at maximum take-off weight in ISA+20°C conditions.

The helicopter’s radius-of-action in an oil and gas mission configuration enables 16 passengers to be transported to offshore rigs at distances of 140 nautical miles (NM.) on crew change flights, extending to nearly 200 NM when 12 passengers are carried. Further certification of the EC175 at an increased maximum take-off weight of 7,800 kg will offer operators the ability to further expand the radius-of-action by 40 NM, or to carry 300 kg of additional payload.

High levels of mission flexibility are ensured with the Helionix avionics, which extends the undisputed superiority of in-flight envelope protection, pilot assistance and situational awareness that have been proven on Airbus Helicopters’ EC225 rotorcraft. In addition, the Rig ‘N Fly GPS- navigation-assisted software will be incorporated in the EC175’s avionics suite to make approaches to, and take-offs from, platform-based helipads safer and simpler.

Airbus Helicopters’ EC175 delivery start-up is backed by the company’s commitment to provide a mature helicopter with a dedicated task force and tools that include validated support and services deliverables, as well as established training capabilities. The support and services offer already has been validated – including in operational conditions with Airbus Helicopters’ EC175 prototype – through a dedicated test campaign to accelerate aircraft maturity.

As part of its investment in support and services resources, Airbus Helicopters installed and certified an EC175 Level D full-flight simulator at its Marignane, France headquarters, which enabled pilot training to begin prior to the start-up of EC175 deliveries. Another EC175 Level D full- flight simulator will be located in the United States, serving oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico.

Blackcomb Aviation’s EC130 will provide support for the company’s exclusive partnership with Whistler Blackcomb Resort for summer helicopter tours on Blackcomb Mountain as well as, supporting year-round tourism flights originating from the Whistler Municipal Heliport. The aircraft will be based in Whistler, B.C., and will also operate out of the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). This is the second aircraft delivered to Blackcomb Aviation this year from Airbus Helicopters, the first being a twin-engine EC135 in May 2014.

“Acquisition of the environmentally-friendly EC130 is an investment in the mission-specific aircraft our customers are demanding in our executive and tourism operations,” said Jonathan Burke, president and COO of Blackcomb Aviation. “We are thankful to the Airbus Helicopters team for their invaluable support and we look forward to continuing our relationship through future expansion of our fleet.”

Blackcomb Aviation currently operates both single and twin-engine Airbus Helicopters aircraft, including an EC120, EC130 B4, two AS350 B2s, two AS350 B3s, an EC135 T2 and four AS355s.

In addition to executive travel, heli-skiing and heli-tourism, Blackcomb Aviation’s aircraft support missions for the power line and hydro sector, search and rescue, flightseeing and film production.

“Thanks to its great visibility, quietness, comfort, performance and safety, this flexible helicopter has become a key member of Airbus Helicopters’ Ecureuil product line,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters Canada. “The EC130 will be a perfect fit for Blackcomb Aviation’s mission requirements and we thank them for once again entrusting Airbus Helicopters to support their multifaceted operations.”

The EC130 B4 is a light, single-engine helicopter with all the latest technology and a roomy, modular cabin with hi-density seating for 1 pilot plus 7 passengers, perfect for heli-skiing and tourism. Its Fenestron tail rotor and automatic rotor speed control result in a significantly reduced operating noise level. Its sound level is 7 dB below the ICAO requirement and thus remains quieter than the most restrictive limits defined by the most demanding noise Regulation (Grand Canyon National Park). Reliable power is provided by the Turbomeca Arriel 2 turbine engine including a dual-channel FADEC (full authority digital engine control) with a third independent back-up channel. Integrated VFR equipment coupled with a global positioning system (GPS) is fitted as standard for day and night missions. The EC130 B4 is particularly adapted to passenger transportation, as well as, EMS, law enforcement and utility missions."
Falcon Eye Spy Sat Contract Goes Into Effect - Defense News,"Tue, 09 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMTQvMTIvMDkvZmFsY29uLWV5ZS1zcHktc2F0LWNvbnRyYWN0LWdvZXMtaW50by1lZmZlY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A contract signed in the summer to supply the Falcon Eye spy satellite to the United Arab Emirates has gone into effect, Airbus Defence and Space said on Tuesday.

The deal has been long awaited as a previous high-profile $930 million contract signed last year between the UAE and France had lapsed before going into effect. Abu Dhabi looked to obtain technology transfer as gulf state officials renegotiated the space contract.

""The contract was officially signed by the United Arab Emirates in August 2014 and is now entering into force,"" Airbus Defence and Space said in statement. The Airbus unit is lead in the industrial team, while Thales Alenia Space is co-prime contractor.

""The Falcon Eye high-performance Earth-observation satellite system will provide an unrivaled observation capability to the Emirate's Armed Forces,"" said François Auque, head of Airbus Space Systems.

""This very wide-ranging cooperation program is, along with the Yahsat communication satellite system, another example of the sustainable cooperation between Airbus Defence and Space and the United Arab Emirates,"" he said.

The contract covers two high resolution optical satellites, a ground system and training for UAE engineers, who will control the satellites once in orbit, Airbus Defence and Space said.

France initially signed the $930 million deal in July 2013, but that ran into difficulties after it emerged the French package included ""back-door"" access to a third, unauthorized party, and also needed US authorization for two specific US-supplied components.

That US clearance slowed the French deal, and it took a private meeting in February between President Barack Obama and François Hollande to reach an agreement to speed up the American authorization.

The UAE initially chose an offer from Lockheed Martin, but French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian succeeded in persuading the gulf state to switch to a French offer, business website La Tribune reported.

Le Drian also managed to persuade Airbus and Thales to pitch a cooperative offer, so there was just one rather than two competing offers from Europe, La Tribune reported.

Thales Alenia Space, 67 percent owned by Thales, 33 percent by Finmeccanica, will supply the payload, while Airbus Defence and Space will deliver the Astrobus platform.

DigitalGlobe, a US independent commercial company, said it had received unsolicited interest from the UAE on its GeoEye-2 satellite. ■

2015: The year ahead in aviation - CNN,"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi8yMi90cmF2ZWwvYXZpYXRpb24taW4tMjAxNS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights The coming year won't yield as many big aviation stories as years past The Airbus 320neo and Bombardier CSeries are expected to enter service in 2015 Declining oil prices should help airlines reap increased profits Major air shows will be lackluster compared with years past

CNN —

In recent years, so much has been going on in the world of commercial aviation that putting together a “top 10 events” forecast has been easy – major new airplane programs have been announced, airline consolidation has taken place and disputes between China and Europe over carbon emissions have held major airplane orders hostage.

Not in 2015.

Looking at the year ahead, it’s a challenge to muster a list of five events likely to grab the general public’s attention, much less 10.

The year 2015 is more about program execution.

Video Ad Feedback Why aviation is going mobile next year 02:03 - Source: CNN

New airplanes from Airbus and Bombardier are scheduled to enter service (EIS) in 2015 and the Airbus A350 XWB, scheduled for delivery to its first customer December 22, will also see its EIS in January.

Boeing’s 787s are in a lull: more than 200 have been delivered and the next version, the 787-10, isn’t scheduled for delivery until 2018.

Embraer is between airplanes, so to speak. Its new, re-engined E-Jet E2 isn’t scheduled for delivery until 2018 and the current generation E-Jet marches on.

Yet even though they do lack the pizzazz of years past, there are still a handful of important events and milestones to look forward to in 2015.

New airplanes to enter service

The Airbus A320neo, the New Engine Option, and the Bombardier CSeries, are supposed to enter service in 2015.

Each is powered by the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fan (GTF), a 20-year research-and-development gamble that brings PW back into the arena as a major player in single-aisle airplane powerplants.

“Supposed to” because new airplane programs from Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier have been replete with delays.

So far, the flight-testing of the A320neo – which had its first flight in September – seems to be going flawlessly, but unknowns can emerge. The A320neo’s EIS is scheduled for October.

For CSeries, EIS of Bombardier’s bet-the-company jump into the big leagues with its first “mainline” jet is an event that was originally supposed to happen in December 2013.

Then the fourth quarter of 2014.

The first flight of the airborne test program didn’t happen until September 2013.

The planned fourth quarter 2014 EIS may have been achieved had it not been for a major engine failure of PW’s GTF during a ground test in May.

The fault was traced to a poorly designed oil seal and not the game-changing engine architecture.

The entire flight test fleet was grounded for three months while the cause and a fix were identified.

Had CSeries been on time, it would have been two years ahead of the A320neo.

Now, it’ll be a toss up as to which airplane enters service first.

According to the Canadian investment bank aerospace analyst at Desjardins, CSeries should have its EIS in October 2015.

Bombardier will only say the second half of 2015, but MTU, a major supplier on the CSeries Pratt & Whitney engine, narrows this down to the fourth quarter.

No matter. EIS for two airplanes in the same month or the same quarter, or even the same year, is a major industry event.

For Airbus, the A350 XWB, the response to the Boeing 787 and the challenge to Boeing’s flagship 777-300ER, was set to be delivered December 22 to launch customer Qatar Airways.

The real flow of deliveries and service entry begins in January.

Declining oil prices mean increased profits

The price per barrel of oil dropped dramatically in 2014.

It’ll probably continue to fall in 2015.

Some believe the price could hit $40 a barrel.

If so, it probably won’t stay there for long before rebounding to $60-$80 and, maybe, back to $100.

Don’t expect any order cancellations or deferrals because of lower oil prices.

The lower oil prices may give new, short-term life to some older airplanes like the Boeing 757, 767, 777 and 747-400; and Airbus A300-600R and early A330s. But that’s about it.

Don’t look for lower airfares driven by cheaper oil, either.

Airline management knows this is a time to reap profits that are elusive in a high-oil price environment.

Air shows will be lackluster

As always, international air shows are huge industry and media events.

This coming year, the Paris Air Show is in June and the Dubai Air Show is in November.

Unlike the air shows of recent years, at which airplane program launches were announced, the Big Four airplane manufacturers – Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer – have tapped out their new airplane launches.

Paris and Dubai will focus more on commercial airplane orders than anything else, and even these are expected to be off compared with previous years.

The peak of the order cycle has come and gone and for the moment, we’re on the downside of the bell curve, especially with oil prices falling and reducing the urgency to place more orders.

Besides, with Airbus and Boeing backlogs out to 2020, there are few slots available for which to place orders.

ATR, the France-based turbo-prop manufacturer with more than 80% of the market, might announce a major upgrade of its venerable ATR-42/72 series with a new engine, new wing and other systems, but turbo-props command neither the market size nor the headlines of the big jets.

An ATR New Engine Option (neo), while important to the airlines, won’t capture the imagination of the air show or reporters.

Asian aviation marches along … slowly

COMAC’s C919 (China), the challenger to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 families, is in development and so is the equivalent Irkut MC-21 (Russia), but neither will take to the skies in 2015.

The AVIC/COMAC ARJ21 (China) is supposed to enter service in 2015 after a seven-year delay, and this time it actually might do so.

But only a few have been sold outside of China and prospects that there will be more orders are dim.

The airplane is largely a learning effort by the Chinese on how to develop an airliner, and the experience has been painful.

The Mitsubishi MRJ90, Japan’s first commercial airliner since the 1960s, is set to enter flight-testing in 2015.

KC-46A flight-testing will draw geek attention

The real aerospace geek will watch for the flight-testing of the Boeing KC-46A aerial refueling tanker for the U.S. Air Force.

It's unsure when the Boeing KC-46A tanker will fly. But when it does, aerophiliacs will be out in full force. Boeing Images

The airplane, based on the commercial Boeing 767-200ER, is already late and approaching $1.5 billion over budget.

Its first flight was supposed to be last fall; now it’s planned for this spring. Or maybe before.

Even Boeing and the Air Force aren’t sure when the bird will fly.

Boeing won the contract in a bitter, bitter fight with Airbus, which proposed its A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport).

Although not without its own challenges, the MRTT is in service in Britain and Australia and has been ordered by several other global air forces."
UPDATED: AirAsia Airbus A320 Flight QZ8501 Confirmed Crashed – Wreckage Found - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi9icmVha2luZy1haXItYXNpYS1hMzIwLW1pc3NpbmctaW5kb25lc2lhbi1haXJzcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On December 28th, at 6:12 am local time, Indonesia AirAsia flight QZ8501, traveling from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore, went missing over the Java Sea. On Tuesday the 30th, wreckage of the plane was discovered in the general area where the last known location was, confirming that QZ8501 had crashed.

The aircraft involved was an Airbus A320-216 registered PK-AXC. Contact was lost with the flight as it was climbing to a higher altitude to avoid weather, which is a standard operating procedure.

There were 155 passengers and seven crew. The cause of crash will likely not be known for quite some time still.

This story will be updated as new information is received. Last updated 12/30/2014 6:40am PST.

AirAsia Flight QZ8501 Updates

12/30 7:20am PST: The worst has been confirmed, flight AirAsia flight QZ8501 crashed into the Java Sea and officials have found wreckage and the remains of passengers on board. They discovered the wreckage about 100nm southwest of Pangkalan Bun in Borneo. Rescuers will continue to search for bodies, wreckage, and of course the flight data recorder (aka black boxes). The black boxes and parts of the fuselage have technologies so rescuers can more easily discover them.

According to aviation journalist Jason Rabinowitz, the fuselage has Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), which are used to find debris above water and Underwater Locator Beacons (ULBs), which are located with the boxes, are used when they are underwater. “Every commercial aircraft has multiple location technologies on board,” Rabinowitz explained to AirlineReporter. “ELTs are located in several spots on the aircraft. These transmitters emit a signal that can be received by other aircraft, boats, or even satellites. However, they do not work once submerged in water.”

“Attached to each black box is an ULB. These beacons are activated once in water and emit a ping over a very specific radio frequency. The ULB has a very short range, and must be picked up by boats passing over the area. The battery typically lasts for around 30 days.”

AirAsia has released another statement:

SURABAYA, 30TH DECEMBER 2014 ’“ AirAsia Indonesia regrets to inform that The National Search and Rescue Agency Republic of Indonesia (BASARNAS) today confirmed that the debris found earlier today is indeed from QZ8501, the flight that had lost contact with air traffic control on the morning of 28th.

Airbus Helicopters Canada delivers AS355 to Hydro One - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzY2FuYWRhZGVsaXZlcnNhczM1NXRvaHlkcm9vbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydro One will use an Airbus Helicopters AS355 NP across Ontario, including for pole and power line patrol and maintenance. Vitek Zawada Photo/Airbus Helicopters Canada

Hydro One’s AS355 NP will provide support for the utility’s work across Ontario, including pole and power line patrol and maintenance. The aircraft will be based in Oro Station, Ontario and is the first twin-engine from the 350 series acquired by Hydro One.

“Selection of a twin-engine aircraft was a natural next step for today’s hydro operations. The AS355 is an investment in our continued focus on safety,” said Gregory Lester, helicopter services manager for Hydro One. “The twin-engine format of the NP adds a redundancy that increases the safety component while the aircraft operates in the low altitude, wired environment.”

Hydro One currently operates a large Airbus Helicopters fleet of aircraft that includes 4 AS350 B2s and 3 AS350 B3s.

“Airbus Helicopters is proud to support Hydro One’s move to the twin-engine market with the AS355.” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters Canada. “This aircraft will be a perfect fit for Hydro One’s mission requirements and we thank them for once again entrusting Airbus Helicopters to support their operations.”

The AS355 has been outfitted with a wide variety of Airbus Helicopters’ optional equipment. The utility package, which has been developed in Canada and is now available on the latest version of Airbus Helicopters’ light twin-engine aircraft, includes installation of cargo pods, wire strike, floor window, high visibility doors, dual controls, longline capabilities, lead acid battery, settling protectors and cargo mirror.

With excellent handling, robustness and ease of maintenance, the AS355 NP incorporates twin-engine added reliability and performance – making it ideal for demanding operations over water, rugged terrain and urban areas. Renowned for its low operation and maintenance costs, this helicopter benefits from the reliability and safety of its two Turbomeca Arrius 1A1 engines and is equipped with a full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system."

Airbus Helicopters has won the support contract to maintain, overhaul and ensure the availability of the German Army Aviation School’s fleet of EC135 training helicopters. This extends the existing contract, signed in 2005, by a further seven years.

“At the core of the Airbus Helicopters full service contract is ensuring that on virtually every working day, eleven EC135 aircraft are available on the airfield for training purposes. This puts the fleet’s operational availability at over 95 percent,” explained Ralf Barnscheidt, head of the Military Support Center in Germany. “A team of technicians that is constantly on-site at the Bückeburg location as well as our specialist maintenance center in Kassel-Calden provide technical and logistical support, carry out throughlife maintenance and even large-scale repair work, and are responsible for ensuring the mission readiness of the helicopters.” Barnscheidt added, “We’re delighted that the Bundeswehr has once again chosen to put its faith in us, building on what is now 15 years of fruitful collaboration on the EC135.”

Col. Uwe Klein, commander of the German Army Aviation School and General in the German Army Aviation Corps, stated that “Airbus Helicopters submitted the most cost-effective bid for the service contract – one that is perfectly tailored to the requirements of the German Army Aviation School – and we look forward to continuing our collaboration. The on-site teams do tremendous work: We can always count on the helicopters we need being available for each and every training session – even for night flights – so that our people have to perform just the pre-flight check.”

The German Army Aviation School in Bückeburg trains some 70 future Bundeswehr pilots using a total of 14 EC135 aircraft, which log about 6,000 flight hours a year. Over the course of twelve months, student pilots learn how to fly a helicopter under visual flight rules and also qualify in IFR and sensor flight in low-altitude night flight."

The airline, which is also leasing another 28 A320neo aircraft, has chosen the A320neo Family to carry out domestic long haul flights and high density routes, including Campinas – Salvador and Campinas – Recife. For Azul, an important driver for selecting the A320neo was the aircraft’s low operating costs and excellent fuel efficiency. Azul Brazilian Airlines has selected CFM engines for their A320neo fleet.

“Azul is an airline that truly serves all of Brazil. With more than 100 destinations , Azul will soon offer even more seats on our longer haul flights, allowing us to reduce operating costs,” said David Neeleman, CEO and Founder of Azul. “In addition to its market leading economics, which will allow Azul to stimulate new demand, the A320neo is also a perfect complement to our E-Jet fleet, giving us additional seats and capacity that can be dedicated to strategic projects like TudoAzul, Azul Viagens and Azul Cargo.”

“Airbus welcomes Azul to the A320 Family and is proud that they will rely on the A320neo’s unbeatable productivity and fuel efficiency to expand their services,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “We are pleased that Azul recognizes Airbus’ commitment to Brazil and the importance of operating the high performance A320neo in key airports such as Santos Dumont in Rio. This order truly underscores the leading position of the A320neo in the single aisle market.”

In April, Azul announced that it would start operating long haul flights by early December. The airline expects to fly new international routes with a fleet of 12 leased wide body Airbus aircraft, including seven Airbus A330-200 and later five Airbus A350-900 equipped with Rolls-Royce engines.

Airbus has obtained regulatory approval for training of A350 XWB airline pilots in accordance with the original goal of an A330/A350 “Common Type Rating” (CTR). This will enable Azul pilots to benefit from reduced training time in the transition from one Airbus jetliner model to another, resulting in significant benefits for airline profitability, pilot productivity and scheduling flexibility.?

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with almost 11,000 orders to date and over 6,200 aircraft delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide. Thanks to its widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18” wide seats in economy as standard. The newest member of the A320 Family, the A320neo, incorporates new generation engines and Sharklets (wing tip devices) which together deliver more than 15 percent in fuel savings. Firm orders for the NEO reached over 3,200 aircraft from 60 customers, representing a 60 percent market share in its category.

Qatar Air: 1st A350 delivery 'postponed until further notice' - USA TODAY,"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTIvMTAvcWF0YXItYWlyLTFzdC1hMzUwLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXBvc3Rwb25lZC11bnRpbC1mdXJ0aGVyLW5vdGljZS8yMDE4NjAxOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Air: 1st A350 delivery 'postponed until further notice'

The delivery of the first Airbus A350 to launch customer Qatar Airways has been delayed, the carrier said Wednesday morning.

The airline had been scheduled to become the first airline in the world to take delivery of the new widebody model this weekend. Qatar Airways had been scheduled to fly away with its first A350 from Airbus' production line in France on Saturday (Dec. 13), with a formal delivery ceremony to take place in Doha, Qatar, on Monday (Dec,. 15).

But the airline said Wednesday morning that the delivery would no longer follow that schedule.

""Qatar Airways announces that the Airbus A350 aircraft ceremonial transfer of title has been postponed until further notice,"" the carrier said in a statement Wednesday morning. ""With the imminent launch of the new Airbus A350 program, both entities are committed to introducing the A350 very soon.""

No reason was given for the delay, though Qatar Airways has a history of late deliveries -- something many attribute to the demanding standards of CEO Akbar al Baker. In 2012, Qatar Airways' first Dreamliner arrived to the airline later than expected. More recently, the delivery of Qatar Airways' first Airbus A380 superjumbo was delayed by nearly three months after Al Baker refused delivery on concerns about the quality of the interior.

Comments from Airbus CEO Tom Enders suggest the possibility of a similar issue with the A350 delivery.

""The plane is ready, it's on the tarmac, I'm confident delivery will be very soon,"" Enders is quoted by Reuters as saying Wednesday at an investors event in London.

In an official statement, Airbus said only that it is ""working very closely with Qatar Airways to meet our common goal to deliver their first A350 XWB very soon."" No specific timeline has been offered for the delivery date.

Either way, the slipping date for the A350 delivery comes as something of a surprise considering that Al Baker said just last month that ""everything is perfect"" with the aircraft as he confirmed expectations for a delivery in mid-December.

The A350 is the newest aircraft model from Airbus. It will be the first entirely new model to be rolled out by the world's two big aircraft makers since Boeing delivered its first 787 ""Dreamliner"" in 2011.

Once it does take the aircraft, Qatar Airways is projected to be the first to put the A350 into commercial service. The carrier has said its first A350 flight with paying passengers is expected to come in January on a route between Qatar Airways' Doha hub and Frankfurt. It was not immediately clear if that was still expected to occur in January, or if that would be pushed back also."

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) sold 248 jets in November, but remained behind Boeing (BA.N) as both planemakers accelerated towards what could be a tight finish to their annual order race.

November's Airbus sales included a total of 120 A320-family aircraft to three unidentified customers.

However CIT Leasing (CIT.N) canceled an order for one of 15 new-generation A350-900 wide-body jets it had bought, as it finalized an order for 15 upgraded versions of the older A330.

In total, Airbus won 1,328 total orders between January and November, company data showed on Friday. After adjusting for cancellations, it had 1,031 net orders. It delivered 554 jets.

On Thursday, Boeing (BA.N) reported 1,380 orders between Jan 1 and Dec 2, including 100 737 MAX confirmed by Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I). Net orders stood at 1,274 aircraft.

Boeing delivered 647 aircraft in the first 11 months.

The two planemakers are heading towards a stronger than expected order intake for 2014, as airlines seek the fuel savings offered by efficient models despite lower oil prices.

Airbus, which is already above its net order target for 2014, has a further 500 provisional orders announced but not yet finalised. Some of these typically get booked in December.

Boeing looks set to top 1,300 net orders for a second year running, exceeding an internal target of 1,100 and reaching what had seemed a stretching scenario just a few months ago.

Airbus said its waiting list of jets sold but not yet delivered had risen above 6,000 units for the first time.

Both firms use overbooking to guarantee a taker for each aircraft produced, mimicking the technique used by airlines to fill seats, meaning some unfilled orders will trickle away.

In a sign of previous overbooking, industry sources say Airbus has been pushing buyers of the current-generation A320 to upgrade to the newer A320neo so that it can halt production of the older model in 2018, as planned, and contain costs.

Story continues

Completing the switch on time while ramping up the A350 are both are seen as crucial to its margin goals.

In November, JetBlue (JBLU.O) converted an order for 10 of the classic version of A321 to the new A321neo.

The tally included the first firm orders for the upgraded A330neo but left unresolved questions over a gap in orders for the current version, which has already seen a production cut.

Airbus has said it is negotiating a potential deal with China, but analysts say assuring smooth cash generation from the A330 remains one of its key challenges in the next two years.

ANALYSIS: Ending Dassault's Airbus connection opens new doors - Flightglobal,"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtZW5kaW5nLWRhc3NhdWx0cy1haXJidXMtY29ubmVjdGlvbi1vcGVucy1uZXctZG9vcnMvMTE1Mjc5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Of all the legacies of 1980s French industrial policy, few are more peculiar than the fact that Airbus owns a short half of the maker of Falcon business jets and Rafale fighters – Dassault Aviation. But now, the three parties to that arrangement, including the French government, have begun to pick it apart. As a blend of politics and business, the affair is, not surprisingly, opaque – so while the implications are far from clear, it is fair to imagine that French aero-industrialists have their sensors finely attuned to the matter.

What we know is that Airbus, which has long held 46.32% of Dassault Aviation, has sold 8% of the company back to Dassault for €794 million ($979 million). Dassault, for its part, will cancel that 8%, plus another 1% of treasury shares, with a net result that Airbus will be left holding 42.11%. Airbus will attempt to sell a further 10%, market conditions permitting, by 30 June 2015, and Dassault will buy up to 5%.

Meanwhile, the French government in the latest transaction – for €980/share, realised late on Friday 28 November – agreed to waive its right of first offer. Paris is, however, maintaining a clear right to stop any transfer of shares that would see Groupe Dassault’s stake fall below 40%. Paris’s intentions may be opaque – or simply may be undefined – but an on-going desire to maintain a strategic influence over key French industries can probably be assumed.

The Airbus stake, after all, is a legacy of Francois Mitterrand-era French government attempts to nationalise Dassault. At the time, founder Marcel Dassault refused to sell, and a compromise was reached that saw the government and government-owned Aérospatiale, a predecessor company of Airbus, purchase minority stakes which eventually dropped onto Airbus’s balance sheet.

But while this transfer of a few shares could be the beginning of a slow unwinding of Airbus’s position in Dassault Aviation, there is no risk that parent company Groupe Dassault – whose other main business is Dassault Systemes, the software house behind the widely used CATIA design suite and a raft of cutting-edge virtual reality applications – will lose control of its aviation arm. Before the latest transaction, Groupe Dassault owned 50.55% of Dassault Aviation. After the purchase and treasury shares cancellation, it will hold 50.95%.

Dassault Aviation

What, then, is changing? For Airbus, the answer would seem to be “very little”. The deal looks to be excellent value for Airbus, which has periodically faced calls to rid itself of what amounts to an idle investment that paid it a profit share of less than €295 million for 2013. In August 2013, Airbus Group shareholder The Children’s Investment (TCI) fund urged chief executive Tom Enders to sell off the Dassault stake, which it estimated to be worth about €4 billion. That figure would value the whole of Dassault Aviation at €8.6 billion, but the latest deal price would translate into a whole-company value of more than €9.9 billion.

The latest deal, combined with the planned share cancellation, leaves more or less unchanged a heavy 3% of Dassault Aviation shares on the open market. Such limited trading volume gives at best a weak signal as to the value of a company which earned €487 million in 2013 on sales of €4.59 billion. To value the company at around €9 billion is a generous 18 times earnings but, ultimately, question marks hang over any valuation.

To properly value Dassault Aviation, consider that more than half of its orderbook is in business jets, where Falcon is a strong player but in an arguably over-supplied market. The rest is in a shrinking defence market where Dassault’s only large customer is budget-strained France. That situation could change if seemingly interminable negotiations over a deal to sell 124 Rafales to India are concluded. But that deal, for 124 aircraft and the first export order for Rafales, was reached in principle in 2012 and no final resolution is in sight.

Sandy Morris, an equities analyst with Jefferies investment bank, says a conclusion to the India deal could open the door to further export sales of the Rafale, whose only operators today are the French air force and navy – and which inevitably competes for sales with the Airbus-championed Eurofighter. But, he stresses, the real significance is that India “underpins” the Rafale programme.

The other big issue in attempting to value Dassault revolves around what Morris calls “the scale of its ambition”. To have Airbus as a large shareholder may not matter much if Dassault carries on as it is. But to attract investors and exploit potential opportunities – for example, to lead a future pan-European unmanned air system development project, with partners that would necessarily include Airbus – would be far easier without messy cross-shareholdings.

To that end, notes Morris, Dassault could fund about half of the cost of buying out Airbus entirely by further tidying up its affairs with the sale of its 29% stake in aerospace electronics group Thales.

Thales, of course, is periodically linked to a strategic partnership of one form or another with that other pillar of French aerospace, Safran. For now, a private sale of 8% of Dassault may not amount to much – but this Airbus-Dassault affair potentially foretells a wider restructuring of the French, if not European, aerospace industrial landscape.

Airbus delivers first two EC175s | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWZpcnN0LXR3by1lYzE3NXMvMTE1Mzg2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first two examples of its new EC175 rotorcraft to Belgian operator Noordzee Helikopters Vlaanderen (NHV), as it looks to put an end to a two-year programme delay.

Handed over on 11 December at a ceremony at the airframer's Marignane headquarters in France, the pair (MSN2 and MSN4) will be utilised for oil and gas offshore transportation.

“Today is a very special day for all of us,” says Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters chief executive. “The delivery of these first EC175s is indeed a key milestone for NHV, for our customer community and for our company.”

Anthony Pecchi/Airbus Helicopters

NHV chief executive Eric Van Hal says he is “proud” to be the first operator of the 7.5t type. The Ostend-headquartered operator has 16 EC175s on order. The company will put its new helicopters into service during the week starting 15 December, with commercial flights to commence from Den Helder.

Van Hal says the EC175s will help the company to accelerate its growth. It plans to open a base in Aberdeen in 2015 using the EC175, as it is ideally suited “to about 80%” of missions from the Scottish site. “We are in touch with a lot of customers and they are seeking a flexible operator that can quickly position an aircraft that are cheaper than the EC225 and [Sikorsky] S-92,” he says.

NHV will take delivery of its next six of the aircraft in 2015, followed by two in 2016 and the remainder in 2017.

So far, four production-standard helicopters have been built – three customer aircraft and a flight-test model – with another 18 on the assembly line.

Most of these are being produced as the offshore variant, although one will be used for VIP transportation.

Airbus Helicopters

The next recipient is likely to be Russian operator UTair, with negotiations continuing on whether to deliver aircraft MSN3 before the end of 2014. None of its pilots have received training by Airbus Helicopters yet, however, although a number of its technicians have been type-rated on the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-powered super-medium twin.

The third of the three launch customers is Héli-Union, but its initial delivery will not occur until during 2015. The French operator will receive MSN5, which has yet to roll off the line.

Presently each helicopter takes around 12 months to complete, but the target is to eventually cut this to five as Airbus ramps up to a rate of 30 per year within three years. This will be achieved by shifting from a static assembly line to a faster flow line, the airframer says.

The backlog for the EC175 is a claimed 64 units. That figure has barely increased over the past 24 months, with five added in 2013 and eight so far this year.

Around two-thirds of the current commitments are firm orders. Faury says that although orders have been slow to come, Airbus Helicopters anticipates more deals shortly, and potentially by year-end. “First delivery and entry into service are important milestones for customers,” he notes.

The EC175 is currently being outsold by the heavier 8.3t AgustaWestland AW189. In a sign of the fierce competition in the new segment, the Anglo-Italian firm announced the day before the EC175's handover that its super-medium had entered service with a third operator – Gulf Helicopters – and that the orderbook for the type had grown further with the sale of two aircraft to Vietnam Helicopter Corporation.

Prior to the new order, Flightglobal's Ascend Fleets database recorded a backlog of 79 helicopters for the AW189, with a further 54 covered by letters of intent or options.

Negotiations between aviation sector representatives from the two sides are still underway, but officials said they expect a final agreement to be announced next year.

Key parties for the potential deal would be state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac) and Russia's state-owned United Aircraft Corp. (UAC)

Not invited to the negotiating table were the companies that now dominate the world's jumbo jet manufacturing industry—Europe's Airbus and America's Boeing. These companies are currently among the only choices available to Chinese airlines looking to modernize or expand their fleets of long-distance, big-load aircraft.

Chinese airlines currently fly Airbus A340, A350, and A380 jets, as well as Boeing 777 and 787 models. These wide-body aircraft are commonly reserved for long distance flight and can accommodate at least 200 passengers, and as many as 800. They're also more fuel- and cost-efficient to operate than smaller passenger jets.

Chinese airlines currently fly about 170 jumbo jets combined, but will need to add at least 1,000 new wide-body aircraft over the next 20 years to meeting rising demand for long-distance air travel, according to a Boeing report.

Some demand for new aircraft is expected to be met by China's homegrown C919, a narrow-body family of Comac passenger jets currently under development. These models are designed to carry between 158 and 174 passengers, thus rivaling the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 medium-range jets.

The first air-worthy C919 model is expected to take its first test flight in late 2015. Meanwhile, Comac has made it to the research stage of a project for an all-new wide-body aircraft that's currently called C929.

The production plan of C929 was first mentioned in 2009, when Shanghai officials released an aviation industry development report describing city plans to expand aviation manufacturing capacity to 230 aircraft annually, including 150 C919 and 30 C929 aircraft.

More recently, on November 7, the French news agency Agence France Presse said C929 production would likely begin in 2023. According to a Chinese aviation executive quoted in the report, Chia wants to begin the wide-body aircraft production within 10 years.

So far, however, the C929 is only on paper. But China is keen to develop its own, wide-body passenger aircraft to compete with the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. And that's apparently why Comac officials have been eyeing a cooperation agreement with Russia.

Step by Step

The first definitive step toward a Chinese-Russian deal came last May, when Comac and UAC officials signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to jointly conduct research into wide-body, long-range passenger aircraft.

The next step came in September with an announcement by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin. He said the two countries planned to sign a contract for joint development of wide-body aircraft in October.

October came and went without a contract signing. However, Comac Chairman Jin Zhuanglong said October 19 that the China-Russia research project would be launched in 2015.

China wants jumbo jets but doesn't want to pay relatively high, Airbus-Boeing prices. A single 787, for example, can cost about $200 million.

The Chinese government would also like to see its domestic aviation industry benefit from the kind of supply chain that would emerge to support homegrown jumbo jet manufacturing. Development of this niche industry would complement the country's emerging manufacturing base for narrow-body aircraft such as the C919. Eventually, China wants to see its passenger jets of all sizes accepted and flying around the world.

China's domestic civil aviation sector has been gradually phasing out small aircraft with fewer than 120 seats in favor of larger jets that can carry up to 250 passengers, according to Yang Yang, who heads Comac's market research division.

Thus, Yang said, the outlook is bright for the C919 and sets the stage for Comac's expansion into jumbo jets.

Agreeing with Wang is Dang Tiehong, Comac's Deputy Director of Marketing, who told Caixin that wide-body aircraft will be an important aviation sector segment in the future. For now, though, Dang said uncertainties have forced Comac to move slowly toward launching a jumbo jet project.

To complement talks with the Russians, for example, Comac recently completed a study on wide-body aircraft production and submitted it to government authorities for review.

Reviving the Dream

Russia has long sought a role in China's aircraft development. In 2005, for example, a Russian aviation official expressed hopes that his country could cooperate with China in the research and development surrounding UAC's Irkut MC21 family of narrow-body passenger jets, which Russian airlines are flying today.

Then in 2012, officials at the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade signaled a willingness to work closely with China's aviation industry. Moreover, Russia's media that year reported that Comac and UAC would work together on a wide-body aircraft based on Russia's now-scrapped Ilyushin IL-96 model passenger jet.

The IL-96, which went into service in 1993, can carry up to 300 passengers on a flight of up to 11,500 kilometers (7,146 miles), which makes it comparable to the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 models. Later, though, the IL-96 was declared an aircraft with too many flaws and unfit for the world market. So the airliner was pulled off the market.

Russia had planned to improve the IL-96 by equipping it with more advanced, efficient engines. These plans never got off the ground, however, due to a lack of funding.

A cooperation project with China could revive the IL-96 dream. A UAC representative told Caixin that Russia would like to work with China on wide-body aircraft development based on the IL-96 model and fitted with engines made in Russia.

But there's no guarantee China would agree to a project based on the IL-96. One skeptic of such a project is Shen Kezheng, an aviation expert with Guangdong Changsheng Aircraft Design Co. who has worked on Chinese aircraft development projects.

Shen told Caixin that the IL-96 may lack the technological features needed for an aircraft to compete on the international market. For example, it's an all-metal aircraft, whereas the equivalent, 250-seat Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are more than 50 percent composite materials.

In Shen's opinion, the proposed China-Russia cooperation would focus on a wide-body jet with about 250 seats. But to compete against Boeing and Airbus, he said, it should be built with composites. And Chinese authorities prefer non-Russian engines made by companies such as Rolls-Royce, General Electric, and Pratt & Whitney.

""Russia doesn't possess advanced technology for large aircraft,"" said Shen. ""But from Russia's perspective, upgrading a mature model (such as the IL-96) will save money. The question is whether China would be willing to do it.""

A Chinese aviation industry source said China wants only the best engines, while Russia is interested in supporting its own engine-manufacturing industry. ""For civil aircraft manufacturing, we shouldn't think about using our own stuff but the world's best,"" the source said.

Russia's aviation technology is world-class in most areas except civilian aircraft engines, said Ni Jingang, Development Department Director at China's AVIC Commercial Aviation Engine Co.

Moreover, according to some industry analysts, China would also like to cooperate with Russia on projects involving heavy-duty helicopter technologies. But Russia's main interest is wide-body aircraft.

""Russia will not give away"" technology, Shen said. ""There are questions about whether they'll use the IL-96 plan as a condition [for any agreement], and whether China will accept it.""

Complementary Partners

At the Zhuhai show, the Chinese Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Xu Dazhe declared, ""China will accelerate its development of large aircraft and heavy helicopters, and develop wide-body aircraft at the proper time.""

An aviation source told Caixin that China and Russia's pending partnership in developing wide-body aircraft would focus on products that could be on the market after 2020, including a model with long-range capacity and double aisles to compete with Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350.

AVIC's Ni said engines for such a wide-body aircraft could be based on an entirely new design, adding that his company is discussing possible cooperation agreements with overseas companies about using their advanced technologies in China's future engine development projects.

But the tone of the Russia-China aircraft relationship would likely differ from China's experience with Western aviation companies.

Liu Gongshi, a senior adviser for the China Air Transport Association, said that although many European and U.S. aviation companies have moved aircraft part or equipment production facilities to China, they have not transferred their core technologies to Chinese plants.

Before attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Beijing in November, Russia's Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov struck a friendly tone in announcing key agreements with China.

Manturov said China and Russia in June had completed preliminary studies on a wide-body aircraft project. Those studies set the stage for the cooperation plans now being drafted.

Manturov also said UAC and Comac in September had finished work on a business plan for manufacturing wide-body aircraft, and then had submitted these proposals to government authorities in each country.

Manturov also said that Russian and Chinese helicopter manufacturers had entered talks focusing on future helicopter project cooperation. These talks had followed an agreement signed in September for the formation of a strategic partnership.

""Both China and Russia have huge demand for wide-body aircraft,"" Liu said. ""It will cost tens of billions U.S. dollars for Russia to work on it alone. Russia has technology and China has money.

""The partnership will be complementary."""
Can Qatar Airways’ New Plane Turn Doha Airport Into a Global Hub? - Skift Travel News,"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMTIvMjQvY2FuLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtbmV3LXBsYW5lLXR1cm4tZG9oYS1haXJwb3J0LWludG8tYS1nbG9iYWwtaHViL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMTIvMjQvY2FuLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtbmV3LXBsYW5lLXR1cm4tZG9oYS1haXJwb3J0LWludG8tYS1nbG9iYWwtaHViL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If Airbus meets production projections, this is aircraft is set up to give Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner a run for its money.

During the reveal of the new Qatar A350XWB in Toulouse, Airbus’ Dr. Kiran Rao, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Marketing highlighted that adding this aircraft to its fleet helps Qatar position itself as global axis hub, out of its new Hamad International Airport in Doha.

“Qatar Airways,” said Dr. Rao, “[is] geographically ideally suited to cover the entire world. With only one stop, most passengers can get to anywhere in the world through the Qatar hub that has been created for the A350, and for the A380, [combined with] the A330s and A320s that they have in service at the moment.”

Skift spoke with airline industry analyst Dr. Addison Schonland, Parter at aviation consultancy AirInsight, at the launch event in Toulouse on December 22, who shared insights on the feasibility of this plan.

Dr. Schonland explained how the addition of this aircraft helps the airline’s strategy to get ahead, as competition heats up in the Gulf between Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates.

“Qatar, Etihad and Emirates are all in a battle to acquire all the traffic they can. Their ambitions are huge with large orders and hopes for attracting traffic. To an extent they have been successful. But the older carriers are responding competitively as the threat becomes clear,” he tells us.

As Dr. Schonland sees it, “[Qatar] can’t outdo Emirates in size, so it seems to want to do so via passenger experience. This is a logical move. Without the fleet of A380s that Emirates has, Qatar can’t compete on volume. It competes on its strengths, which are cabin and service.”

While Qatar’s A380s, the first of which the airline received in Hamburg this September, feature a First Class cabin, with ample seating capacity for 48 in Business Class, Qatar’s A350XWB is a two-class configuration: Business and Economy.

The A350XWB seats 36 in Business Class and 247 Economy Class passengers. The Economy cabin is divided by service galleys, which reduces the overwhelming visual impact of multiple identical rows of seats. The airline also employed color changes in the Economy seat covers for this purpose. During our fly tour experience, we found the Economy seats comfortable, featuring adjustable headrests, ample leg room and state-of-the-art Thales Avant System In-Flight Entertainment. We also enjoyed reduced cabin noise, which allowed comfortable conversation with colleagues, and plenty of natural light from the aircraft’s larger windows. All these features made the journey pleasant, regardless of cabin class.

At present, Qatar flies to over 130 destinations on six continents, and intends to continue adding routes.

Dr. Schonland believes adding the A350XWB to its fleet was a smart move for Qatar Airways.

“With the A350XWB, Qatar has the tool to accomplish its task of moving market share away from competition,” Dr. Schonland says. “Its lower costs and range make it potentially disruptive and a cash generating machine.”

The question is whether Airbus can keep up with its production schedule. Qatar has ordered 80 A350XWBs, and the manufacturer has orders on the books to fulfill from other airlines. Airbus insists it can meet this demand, and His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways Chief Executive, made it clear he will hold Airbus to that promise."
NHV ready to launch new EC175s - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvbmh2cmVhZHl0b2xhdW5jaG5ld2VjMTc1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NHV CEO Eric Van Hal said that the oil-and-gas operator is well-prepared for the EC175’s entry into service.

Belgium-based Noordzee Helicopters Vlaanderen (NHV) is putting two new Airbus Helicopters EC175s into commercial service this week. The offshore oil-and-gas helicopter support provider received the first two EC175s as part of a 16-aircraft order on Dec. 11 at the Airbus Helicopters facility in Marignane, France. The EC175 features Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PT6-C67E turboshaft engines and the manufacturer’s proprietary avionics system, Helionix.

The EC175 program has been delayed nearly two years, causing NHV to reshuffle some assets in order to cover the resulting operational gap. As one of three launch customers for the EC175 — the others are UTair in Russia and France’s Heli-Union — NHV maximized the extra time by conducting pilot and maintenance training to familiarize the NHV team with the helicopter, according to CEO Eric Van Hal, who noted it always takes longer to be among the first operators of any type.

“Waiting has its advantages,” Van Hal told Vertical during the delivery ceremony in Marignane, adding that NHV is “well-prepared for the start of operations.” The new helicopters are scheduled to conduct their first commercial flight less than a week after delivery, with pilot and maintenance courses completed prior to the handover.



NHV’s Airbus Helicopters EC175 taxis before a flight to its new base to begin service this week.

Current plans call for Airbus Helicopters to deliver six more EC175s to NHV during 2015, with two at the end of the first quarter, two in September and two at the end of the year. Another EC175 duo will enter service in early 2016, with the rest in 2017, according to Van Hal. The target is to fly between 500 and 600 hours during first quarter 2015, he said.

Part of the program holdup is related to a different aircraft program, the AS332 and EC225 Super Puma, which experienced two ditchings in the North Sea in 2012, leading to a redesign of the main vertical bevel gear shaft. Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said the EC225 problems — which demanded the attention of company engineers following the 2012 incidents — represented a “wake up call” for Airbus Helicopters. “The difficulties served as a driver for us to move forward,” he added.

The manufacturer put together a “transformation plan,” with a focus on increasing quality, safety and reliability across all platforms, in order to “place the bar at a higher level,” he said. Faury pointed to new flight crew operating manual (FCOM) being developed with operators for the EC225, saying that a similar manual will be assembled for the EC175. He also cited the Vision 1000 flight data recorder, which is being installed on all civil variants by the end of 2015, as another step toward ensuring safe operations.

As one of the EC175 launch customers, Van Hal said that NHV had “a lot of meetings with Airbus Helicopters at all sorts of levels, as well as on maintenance systems, data gathering and sharing, training — all sorts of things.” The process continues, “because we are the people who are going to fly the first data on the line, so we are in very close cooperation to ensure the helicopter’s success. The changes will come when we start flying it,” he said. Van Hal envisions “the maturation of the aircraft going very fast” as other operators gather performance data.

Van Hal is pleased with the new helicopter’s performance. “I think they are spot on,” he said. “They took the time to do it right, and certainly after the EC225 problems, they cannot afford to miss this one. They’ve done everything to make it a successful machine.”



Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury (left) and NHV CEO Eric Van Hal sign the official handover of the first two EC175s on Dec. 11.

According to Benoit Bagourd, program manager for the NHV EC175 contract at the Marignane plant, it currently takes around 14 months to produce an EC175, mainly because it’s a new program. With production ramping up, the manufacturer seeks to reduce that time to about six months. The aircraft has more than 12,000 parts, not including standard parts such as rivets. Currently, 18 helicopters are in various stages of production at the EC175 plan in Marignane.

Nicolas Jaunard, marketing manager for Airbus Helicopters Training Services, noted that instruction for NHV maintenance personnel began in April 2014, with NHV pilots starting simulator training in July. Through early December, a total of 14 NHV pilots have gone through the training program. The syllabus includes eight hours in the flight navigation procedures trainer (FNPT), followed by 13 hours in a Level D-qualified full flight simulator (FFS) developed in partnership with Indra Systems, and concludes with five hours of flight training in the EC175.

According to Faury, there are currently 64 orders for the EC175, with about two-thirds of those considered firm. The helicopter is intended for oil-and-gas markets, as well as search-and-rescue, passenger transport and corporate/VIP operators. The manufacturer is also working on a version with de-icing certification.



Teams from NHV and Airbus Helicopters gather around an EC175 during the ceremony for the first two deliveries of the type.

In early 2014, Airbus Helicopters reached a framework agreement with Avicopter to create a 50/50 organization that will jointly produce the EC175 and its Chinese counterpart, the AC352, which features Turbomeca/Avic Ardiden 3C engines. The partnership to produce 1,000 helicopters is valued at around US$19.3 billion.

“Ten years from now, China will be a very important market, if not the most important one, in terms of sales of new helicopters,” said Faury. “But for the moment, it remains rather limited.” He added that the agreement allows for Airbus Helicopters to cover a number of countries in Europe, North America and South America with the EC175, while Avicopter is in charge of commercializing the AC352 variant inside and around China."
Head of Search Effort: Air Asia Flight Believed to be ‘at the Bottom of the Sea’ - Voice of America - VOA News,"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvaW5kb25lc2lhLW1pc3NpbmctcGxhbmUvMjU3NjMzNy5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2luZG9uZXNpYS1taXNzaW5nLXBsYW5lLzI1NzYzMzcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The chief of the search effort for missing Indonesia AirAsia flight 8501, which vanished a day earlier, stated Monday that ""the hypothesis is the plane is at the bottom of the sea.""

Bambang Soelistyo, chief of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS), spoke to reporters in Jakarta, adding that this is ""the preliminary suspicion and it can develop based on the evaluation of the result of our search.""

Military aircraft from Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are flying over the Java Sea searching for any wreckage from the Airbus 320.

Reports have come in from an Australian Orion aircraft of debris found about 1,100 kilometers from where the plane lost contact, but there is no indication yet if they are pieces of the missing plane.

The US Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement it had not been asked to join the search.

""As we have in the past, the U.S. Navy assets in 7th Fleet stand ready to assist in any way that's helpful,"" said Lt. Lauren Cole, deputy public affairs officer for the fleet.

But American assistance could be en route soon. Soelistyo said Indonesia does not have the tools necessary for a submersible search, ""so we will borrow from other countries which have offered. They are the U.K., France and U.S.""

The relatively shallow Java Sea is one of the world's busiest waterways.

The jetliner departed Surabaya for Singapore's Changi airport early Sunday on what should have been a two-hour flight. But flight QZ8501 disappeared about halfway to Singapore.

The pilot had asked air traffic controllers for permission to ascend about 1,800 meters to nearly 11,600 meters (38,000 feet) to avoid stormy weather. An Indonesian transport ministry official said permission was denied because another plane was flying in the area.

After that, communication went silent. Controllers did not receive any distress call from the pilot. The last transmission from a crew member on the Airbus reportedly came at 6:12 a.m. local time on Sunday.

On board were 149 Indonesian passengers, including 16 children. The flight manifest also lists three South Koreans (one of them an infant), a Malaysian and a British man traveling with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter.

The flight crew was composed of two pilots, four flight attendants and one engineer - all Indonesian citizens except for the French first officer, according to AirAsia.

The captain in command is described as quite experienced with more than 20,000 flying hours -- roughly 6,000 of those hours with Indonesia AirAsia in the cockpit of the Airbus A320.

Relatives of passengers and crew were briefed Monday morning at Surabaya airport. They also met behind closed doors with AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes, who is grappling with the budget airline group's first tragedy since it took to the skies in 1996.

""Until today we have never lost a life. But I think any airline CEO who says that he can guarantee that his airline is 100 percent safe is not accurate. There are so many factors,"" Fernandes said on Monday. ""And right now we cannot speculate as to what was the cause of the accident.""

Indonesia AirAsia, previously known as Air Wagon International which began flying in 1999, is 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia. The low-cost AirAsia family of airlines serves more than 100 destinations in 22 countries.

AirAsia has become Airbus' largest customer for the A320 and ordered 100 more of the twin engine jet planes two years ago. The aircraft is usually configured to hold between 150 and 180 passengers and operates on short to medium-haul routes."
Flight Review: Taking Qatar Airways’ Airbus A350 Delivery Flight to Doha - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi9mbGlnaHQtcmV2aWV3LXRha2luZy1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWZsaWdodC1kb2hhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was written by Chris Sloan and originally published on AirwaysNews.

At 9:28 PM LT on Tuesday, December 23, Qatar’s first A350 XWB landed in Doha’“under the cover of darkness’“with approximately 70 Qatar employees, VIP’s and media on-board the delivery flight from Toulouse, France.

On Monday, Airbus handed over the first A350 XWB to launch customer Qatar Airways, and shortly after taking delivery of the aircraft, several executives and more than a hundred members of the media flew on a short demonstration flight over the Mediterranean.

The delivery flight to Doha would be operated as a normal commercial scheduled flight, but just with fewer people then typical. Business Class was full while approximately ten passengers’“who were all employees of Qatar’“would have the two economy cabins to themselves.

As much as I was anticipating experiencing the Airbus A350 XWB in a true commercial flight, I was equally as curious in putting Qatar’s renowned SkyTrax 5-star rated Business Class, marketed and self-proclaimed as ’œWorld’s Best Business Class,’ to the test. Burning questions include: Would it live up to all the hype and marketing expectations? Is it truly a First Class product at a Business Class price? Is the Airbus A350XWB cabin truly an ’œeXtra Wide Body’ experience in the same league as its 787 competitor from Everett?

Finnair Airbus A350 – Rendering, Airbus

These aircraft will be delivered in a two-classs configuration holding a total of 297 passengers aboard, to be used on their long haul network to the Americas and Asia.

The airline now has a total of 19 A350-900s on order, which will be used for expansion as well as replacing the existing nine quad-engined Airbus A340 aircraft that Finnair operate.

Finnair are the European launch customer of the A350, and are a pretty solid Airbus operator using aircraft from the A320, A330 and A340 families, with regional services operated by Embraer E170/E190 aircraft.

For Airbus, its a good sign as the order book for the A350 tips over 775 aircraft now – with an exercise of a purchase option to boot too.

Delivery of the A350s to Finnair will commence in the autumn of 2015. For Finnair which used to operate diverse aircraft inculding DC-10s and MD-11s, it’s more investment into the Airbus product catalogue, and allows them to use their current pilots to convert them A350 crew at a low cost.

And combined with the expected fuel savings, all those pennies add up…
