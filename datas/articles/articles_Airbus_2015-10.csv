Airbus 'mezzanine' patent has passengers stacked on top of each other - WIRED,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtc2VhdC1wYXRlbnQtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1zdGFja2VkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cramped seating arrangements on economy flights could get significantly worse if Airbus' latest design ever becomes a reality. A patent filed by the plane manufacturer envisions stacking passengers on top of one another -- a bit like blocks in a game of Tetris.

""In modern means of transport, in particular in aircraft, it is very important from an economic point of view to make optimum use of the available space in a passenger cabin,"" Airbus wrote in the patent application.

The design -- which ""still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers"" -- involves two levels of passengers in a standard aircraft cabin, with a ""mezzanine seating area"" replacing hand luggage overhead lockers.

Airbus imagines this arrangement would be ""suitable"" for business class as the seats could recline as much as 180 degrees.

A similar tiered approach to air travel was conceived by factorydesign and claims to allow for 30 percent more passengers. And if Airbus' concept turns out to look as comfortable as factorydesign's Air Lair, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

Airbus has previously patented seats with built in VR helmets to help passengers escape their cramped confines at 33,000 feet.

Other unusual aeroplane seating plans include another Airbus patent for ""motorcycle-type saddles,"" and Zodiac Aerospace's concept design of alternate forward and backward facing seats in a honeycomb-like arrangement.

Airbus A320 safety record in spotlight after Russia plane crash - The Guardian,"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE1L29jdC8zMS9haXJidXMtYTMyMC1zYWZldHktcmVjb3JkLWluLXNwb3RsaWdodC1hZnRlci1lZ3lwdC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE1L29jdC8zMS9haXJidXMtYTMyMC1zYWZldHktcmVjb3JkLWluLXNwb3RsaWdodC1hZnRlci1lZ3lwdC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The plane crash in Egypt has focused attention on the safety record of the plane involved.

The Airbus A321 had just taken off from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, on its way to St Petersburg, Russia, a route it covered regularly.

The plane is one of the A320 fleet, which includes the A318 and A319. A jet from the A320 family, of which there are about 6,200, takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world

The A321 is the largest member of the A320 family. The company says the aircraft “offers airline customers the best seat-mile costs of any single-aisle aircraft and seating capacities comparable to that of a widebody jetliner”.

The plane first started flying in 1993 and went into commercial operation the following year. More than 900 have been made. The two-engine jet can carry up to 220 passengers and is capable of flying up to 3,000 nautical miles while carrying a maximum passenger payload. “Like each member in Airbus’ A320 family of jetliners, the A321 offers the lowest fuel burn, emissions and noise footprint in its class,” Airbus says.

The last high-profile incident involving an A320 jet was in March, when Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed in the French Alps with the loss of 150 passengers and crew. In this case the plane was deliberately crashed by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz.

The previous November a Lufthansa A321 plane had lost altitude over Spain.

The Aviation Safety Network says there have been 16 serious incidents involving the A321 since 1996, only one of which was fatal. In 2010 an Airblue A321 with 152 passengers crashed in Islamabad.

AeroInside, which gathers data on aviation incidents and accidents, has 212 incidents involving an A321 on file, most involving relatively minor technical issues.

In September, a Thomas Cook Airbus A321-200 flying from Manchester to Izmir in Turkey reported a hydraulic problem and returned to Manchester where it landed safely.

The same month two fires were detected in the toilet of a Monarch Airlines Airbus A321-200, flying from Birmingham to Sharm el-Sheikh. In both cases the crew extinguished the fires and the flight continued."

— -- Flying across the pond from New York to London could take as little as an hour, thanks to a patent design for a ""rocket motor""-propelled aircraft.

Airbus is hoping to create an aircraft called Concorde-2 that can travel at supersonic speed and carry passengers across the Atlantic in record time, according to Conde Nast Traveler.

The U.S. government approved a patent for Airbus' Concorde-2 in July 2015.

The U.S. government approved Airbus' patented design in July to build an aircraft that would be able to fly at speeds of up to 4.5 times the speed of sound. This would be three times as fast as the speed of the original Concorde jet, which was retired in 2003.

The aircraft would use three separate engines -- turbojets, ramjets and a ""rocket-motor"" -- to propel the Concorde-2 through the air at hypersonic speed, and would be able to fit up to 19 passengers.

The U.S. government approved a patent for Airbus' Concorde-2 in July 2015.

The Concorde-2 design has only been patented and it is not clear if the plane will ever get off the ground, according to Conde Nast Traveler. The patent application does however note the possibility of military use for the Concorde-2 design."
What is with this hellish airplane seat arrangement from Airbus? - The Verge,"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEwLzUvOTQ1Nzg1Ny93aGF0LWlzLXdpdGgtdGhpcy1oZWxsaXNoLWFpcnBsYW5lLXNlYXQtYXJyYW5nZW1lbnQtZnJvbS1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Don't be fooled: this isn't a torture device, nor is it a geometric painting from one of the abstractionist masters. It is, somehow, a proposed seating arrangement for aircraft brought to you by the sadists at Airbus, who have now resorted to physically stacking passengers on top of one another.

What?

As near as I can tell, one ""advantage"" of this setup is that at least some of the seats can be configured to lie flat — but that doesn't change the fact that there are people on top of people. If there was any doubt in your mind that we are merely cargo when we board a flight, this should take care of that.

The airline industry's never-ending push for brutal efficiency has brought us ridiculous seating arrangements before, and I imagine this won't be the last of it. The silver lining, if there is one, is that this is only a patent application right now — there's no sign that this is making it into real aircraft, at least not any time soon."
Airbus Signs $17 Billion Aircraft Deal With China - Fortune,"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC8yOS9haXJidXMtY2hpbmEtZGVhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China has agreed to buy 130 planes from Airbus in a deal worth $17 billion. The new agreement gives Airbus a leg up in its battle against Boeing to claim a share of the fast-growing Chinese market, which is expected to become the largest for air travel in the world in the coming decades.

The deal was signed during a meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Bloomberg reports. It will bring 30 twin-aisle Airbus planes to China, as well as 100 single-aisle aircraft. China had already ordered 45 of the twin-aisle planes back in June. Boeing, for its part, is sending 300 jets to Chinese carriers as part of a deal struck in September.

According to Boeing, China will require an additional 6,330 new planes over the next 20 years. The rapid expansion is worth nearly a trillion dollars to aircraft manufacturers. By 2034, China will be the largest air travel market in the world."
Cost-Cutting Airline Seating Could Stack Passengers on Top of Each Other - Bloomberg,"Fri, 09 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE1LTEwLTA5L2Nvc3QtY3V0dGluZy1haXJsaW5lLXNlYXRpbmctY291bGQtc3RhY2stcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1vbi10b3Atb2YtZWFjaC1vdGhlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When you’re flying and pretzels are raining down on you, and shoes are drubbing your head like metronomes, blame Stephan Sontag, Paul Edwards, and Benedikt Kircher.

The system would have one seat “arranged at a first lower level,” and “at least” one other seat above on an “elevated level.” (The “at least” is ominous.) Both seats would be able to recline into bed positions, enhancing the feeling of being on a packed interstellar transport ship headed to colonize Hoag's Object. If your upstairs neighbor is being noisy, though, this position affords you the advantage of pounding on their seat and yelling, “Keep it down up there!”"
Airbus files patent to stack airline passengers on top of each other. - Slate,"Fri, 09 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTUvMTAvYWlyYnVzLWZpbGVzLXBhdGVudC10by1zdGFjay1haXJsaW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtb24tdG9wLW9mLWVhY2gtb3RoZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every so often, we get a new chapter in the ongoing saga of the incredible shrinking plane seat. Usually, it involves an airline trimming another fraction of an inch off the width of your seat cushion, or ever-so-slightly decreasing what’s left of your legroom. But a patent filed by aviation manufacturer Airbus this month boldly goes where no seat shrinker has gone before: the space above your head.

“In modern means of transport, in particular in aircraft, it is very important from an economic point of view to make optimum use of the available space in a passenger cabin,” Airbus explains in an application filed Oct. 1 with the U.S. Patent and Trade Office. “Passenger cabins are therefore fitted with as many rows of passenger seats as possible, which are positioned with as little space between them as possible. In order to still more efficiently use the space in a passenger cabin of an aircraft, U.S. Pat. No. 4,066,277 proposes to position an elevated deck structure on a main deck floor in the passenger cabin of a wide-body aircraft for providing a mezzanine seating area in a substantially unused upper lobe of the aircraft fuselage.”

As you can see in the image above, Airbus proposes accomplishing this still more efficient use of aircraft space by essentially stacking passengers on top of each other. Feeling claustrophobic? Fear not! Each seat includes a “supporting surface” that can move between an upright seating position and a fully reclined one. As Airbus helpfully notes, when these seats are dropped into their lying-down positions, the result is “a lowering of the supporting surface” and thus an increase in the distance between your seat and that of your vertical neighbor.

See? It looks cramped when the people are sitting upright. But then they lie down, and their heads get further apart!

Not convinced? OK, yeah, neither am I. If we’re being honest, the Airbus seating diagram evokes several unmentionable things which I will not state here but invite you to share in the comments. Lowering the seats into their fully reclined mode also doesn’t seem like much of a solution, unless you intend to spend every flight lying flat on your back. On a practical level, the design also raises safety concerns, cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby tells Reuters. “The obvious number one is the regulatory requirement for safe evacuation of passengers in 90 seconds,” she says.

On the other hand: The layout in Airbus’s patent could bring our era of Knee Defender fights and “recline rage” to an end. When passengers are bunked into planes like kids at camp, they’ll surely find better things to be angry about.

Hawaiian Airlines Announces Premium Cabin Redesign of its Airbus A330 Fleet with Lie-Flat Seating - Hawaiian Airlines | Newsroom,"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmhhd2FpaWFuYWlybGluZXMuY29tL3JlbGVhc2VzL2hhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFubm91bmNlcy1wcmVtaXVtLWNhYmluLXJlZGVzaWduLW9mLWl0cy1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1mbGVldC13aXRoLWxpZS1mbGF0LXNlYXRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HONOLULU – Hawaiian Airlines today announced plans to introduce new luxury design elements and enhanced service options in its A330 premium cabins, including the addition of 180-degree lie-flat seats. The premier global carrier for leisure travel to Hawai’i has developed its new seats in partnership with Optimares, an Italian manufacturer focused on traveler-centric design.

“We have designed an experience that will usher in a new era in premium service to Hawai’i, one that resulted from a thorough review of guest feedback and intensive research to develop a best-in-class product for our long haul aircraft,” said Mark Dunkerley, President and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “Together with our partners at Optimares and PaulWylde, we have created a truly bespoke design that delivers world-class comfort and style, while staying true to our island roots. Whether traveling for business, with family or on a romantic retreat, the new premium cabin evokes an engaging bold, contemporary sense of Hawai‘i, complemented by the warm aloha spirit of our cabin crew. We’re creating an environment of tranquility and comfort in the air.”

The 180-degree seats will use an innovative seat platform to fold into 76-inch beds, maximizing living space for travelers while providing options for both privacy and a shared flight experience. They will also feature an advanced in-flight entertainment experience powered by the next generation of large-format tablets and equipped with a telescoping tablet arm that adjusts to optimize viewing angle and comfort.

Hawaiian Airlines new business cabin for its A330 aircraft, featuring 180-degree lie-flat seating.



“The new premium class product implemented exclusively for Hawaiian Airlines by Optimares has been developed around a clear strategic vision shared between the teams,” said Alessandro Braca, CEO of Optimares. “The product has been created for the unique needs and expectations of the Hawaiian Airlines guest, combining high-tech solutions and a truly innovative design.”

Hawaiian worked with West Coast-based brand and design consultancy PaulWylde to translate the airline’s signature design language, rooted in the natural colors and forms of the island landscape, into the cabin experience. The cabin design will incorporate flowing curves evocative of the winds and ocean, while marrying organic textures, pops of bright saturated color, and luxury materials like leather from Poltrona Frau.

“There’s an undeniable magic to Hawaiian. The airline has such a rich culture and romantic brand identity that stands out from other airlines with distinction,” said Paul Wylde, founder, CEO and creative director “It’s a designer’s dream to be able to translate this brand expression into the modern aircraft cabin environment. Our challenge was to balance a modern, stylish and premium aesthetic that’s increasingly expected from guests with the unique authenticity, culture and color of Hawaii – a destination that many compare to paradise.”

Hawaiian, PaulWylde and Optimares collaborated intensively to ensure the seat and cabins are uniquely tailored to the needs of the Hawaii traveler. The seats will be installed in a 2-2-2 configuration ideally suited for couples and families traveling to the beautiful Hawaiian Islands.

The first newly outfitted aircraft is expected to enter Hawaiian’s long-haul network in the second quarter of 2016. The airline will begin installing lie-flat seats in the remaining 22 A330 aircraft in September of 2016 through 2017.

As part of the cabin redesign, Hawaiian also announced it will add 28 additional Extra Comfort seats on each A330 aircraft in response to growing demand for its popular premium economy service. The Extra Comfort option features 36 inches of seat pitch; priority boarding at the gate; complimentary on-demand in-seat entertainment; and a personal power outlet.

Today, Hawaiian’s wide-body, twin-aisle Airbus 330-200 aircraft seat 294 passengers, with 18 in Business/First Class, 40 in Extra Comfort and 236 in the Main Cabin. In the new configuration, the aircraft will seat 278 passengers, with 18 in Business/First Class, 68 in Extra Comfort and 192 in the Main Cabin. Seat pitch in the Main Cabin will remain a roomy 31 inches.

Hawaiian operates its A330 aircraft on the majority of its North American and international routes. Amenities include personal on-demand entertainment system, comfortable legroom, and a roomy interior. Adding to the enjoyment of the travel experience is the carrier’s signature onboard hospitality program, Mea Ho‘okipa (translation: I am host). Travelers are treated to island-inspired complimentary meals and made-in-Hawai‘i snacks to go along with the airline’s engaging presentation of the islands’ culture, people and Aloha Spirit throughout the flight.

Airbus patents horrible-looking plan to stack air passengers on top of one another - GeekWire,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE1L2FpcmJ1cy1wYXRlbnRzLWhvcnJpYmxlLWxvb2tpbmctcGxhbi10by1zdGFjay1haXItcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1vbi10b3Atb2Ytb25lLWFub3RoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Geek Life: Fun stories, memes, humor and other random items at the intersection of tech, science, business and culture.

Air travel is hellish enough, but this patent might take that incredibly awkward, uncomfortable experience one step further by stacking passenger seats on top of one another.

Airbus filed the patent, which Telegraph Travel unveiled, showing a row of seats on a second “mezzanine” type level built to take advantage of the empty space above. Several different designs are sketched out, showing configurations of seating on both levels that even include the possibility for bunk bed-like reclining seats.

It looks oddly promising, but really, it would come down to execution — and let’s all stop and think about how well the airlines do with that. This is one idea that, depending on how it’s done, has the potential to be downright amazing — or downright awful.

While the engineers pointed out the best-case scenario to the Telegraph — “seats would be positioned in such a way to provide maximum space, and ideally keep the limbs and other body parts of passengers out of each customer’s eyeline,” let’s get real here. I don’t see a future of happily reclining. I see a future of what exists now, just doubled-stacked.

Sorry, Airbus.

BTW, how is that ultra-rapid aircraft that goes from NYC to London in one hour with sky hammocks doing? Maybe you should focus on that.

But as the Telegraph points out, Airbus patents a ton of stuff every year — and this stacked passenger seat model might never make it off the page.

What do you think of Airbus’ seat plan? Genius or a nightmare?"

Show Caption Hide Caption No survivors after Russian plane crashes in Egypt Officials say most of the 217 passengers on the plane were tourists departing from an Egyptian resort. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

The Airbus A321 that crashed Saturday killing all 224 on board had almost no record of problems since it was first flown 18 years ago and this was first fatal crash for Metrojet, the Russian airline operating the aircraft, according to the Aviation Safety Network.

The plane was en route from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, Russia, when it crashed 23 minutes into the flight. Rescuers found wreckage littering the desert and strewn bodies, many of them still strapped in their seats.

A history of aircraft posted by the Aviation Safety Network, a private and independent website of the non-profit Flight Safety Foundation tha tracks aviation accidents. shows the only incident involving the aircraft was a tail-strike accident that occurred in 2001 during a landing in Cairo.

The airline said the pilot, identified by Russian media as Nemov Valery Yuryevich, had 12,000 hours of flying experience, with 30% of that at the controls of an A-321 Airbus. Metrojet said in a statement that the required factory maintenance of the aircraft was carried out last year.

The A321-200 jet that crashed is the largest version of the Airbus twin-engine A320 series that is capable of seating 240 passengers, according to a statement issued Saturday by the manufacturer. The plane had accumulated more than 56,000 fight hours in nearly 21,000 flights, Airbus said.

That model aircraft, which went into production in 1994, has been involved in only other fatal crash when a Airblue A-321 flew into the side of a mountain during an approach to an airport in Islamabad, Pakistan on July 28, 2010. All 152 aboard were killed and the crash was blamed on a combination of weather conditions and pilot error.

The chairman of the state company that runs Egypt's civilian airports, Adel Mahgoub, said the plane had undergone routine technical checks prior to takeoff, according to the Associated Press."
"Airbus designing new tank to cut down on “unusable fuel"" - USA TODAY","Sat, 03 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTUvMTAvMDMvYWlyYnVzLWRlc2lnbmluZy1uZXctdGFuay10by1jdXQtZG93bi1vbi11bnVzYWJsZS1mdWVsLzgzMDcxNTQwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus designing new tank to cut down on “unusable fuel""

During a flight, jet fuel collects in areas unable to be reached by the plane’s pumps, primarily because of the geometrical shape of the wing. It's similar to the way a little soda always remains at the bottom of a can. Also, fuel pumps are purposely raised above the base of the tank to avoid sucking up water or sediment that may collect there.

On a single international flight, this unused fuel can amount to several hundred pounds of extra weight that reduces the range of the plane and the amount of payload it can carry, which Airbus is hoping to alleviate with new wing designs.

Engineers at Airbus’s ProtoSpace innovation facility in Toulouse, France are attempting to solve the problem using 3D-printed test models and components, including a full-scale, quarter-size A330 centre fuel tank to examine how fuel moves around in the tank, where puddles form, and how they can be moved to where the pump can extract it. As Airbus explained to Road Warrior Voices:

The solution is looking at state of the art analysis along with a combination of new technologies and re-use of existing technologies.

So far, some solutions have cut down the amount of unusable fuel by half, according to Airbus. Plus, achieving the improvement may be possible as a retrofit instead of more significant structural changes. However, Airbus only plans to apply the changes in fuel tank design to its A330neo, currently under development and scheduled to enter service in late 2017. If the market responds, it will consider retrofitting existing aircrafts.

Beyond that, Airbus is saying little:

Airbus aircraft are already good in terms of unusable fuel volumes compared to the wider industry, and with the current research we are aiming at achieving an even better level.

Don't count on any extra savings being passed on to fliers."
Airbus provides H135 upgrade details - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 08 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzcHJvdmlkZXNoMTM1dXBncmFkZWRldGFpbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters “new” H135 will be equipped with the manufacturer’s Helionix avionics system. Airbus Helicopters Image

Airbus Helicopters has provided more details about the “new” H135 that was revealed at Helitech International in London, England, yesterday.

The major change will see light twin-engine aircraft equipped with the manufacturer’s in-house Helionix avionics system, but it will also feature a four-axis autopilot, and a redesigned aft cabin roof for 165 liters more cabin space.

The Helionix system was introduced into service through the H145 and H175 last year, and is set to be included in Airbus Helicopters’ newly-unveiled H160. Speaking to Vertical, Axel Humpert, head of the H135 program at Airbus Helicopters, said the addition of Helionix and four-axis autopilot would help increase situational awareness and reduce pilot workload.

“Just imagine you are over the sea, in front of a mountain, or on a building and you want to stabilize your flight on the spot, on the point, then the fourth axis is the one that helps the pilot to reduce his workload and concentrate on the environment or whatever his duties are,” he said.

Another benefit, he said, was that it brought the H135 in line with the manufacturer’s “family concept” of a common avionics system. “It allows operators who are operating several models of our fleet to reduce the cost of training and type conversion. That’s a big benefit.”

The additional space has been created from the redesigned engine air inlet that was changed from the EC135 T2/P2 version to the EC135 T3/P3 (H135). This allowed the manufacturer to move avionics equipment from behind the rear headrests, creating the additional space.

The upgrade is set to be certified by the end of 2016, with deliveries set to begin in 2017 to launch customer the Norwegian Air Ambulance.

Humpert said the manufacturer would continue taking orders for the existing version of the H135 (equipped with a Meghas avionics suite) for operators looking for fleet commonality, but would produce only the Helionix-equipped version from 2017/18.

There will be no price increase for the new version of the H135, Humpert added. “Of course we have a new avionics system, which offers more — the fourth axis, the functions— but as we are installing it throughout our fleet, we have a price advantage which we return to the customer.”"
Why airplane makers keep trying to patent horrifying seating arrangements - The Washington Post,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtc3dpdGNoL3dwLzIwMTUvMTAvMDcvd2h5LWFpcnBsYW5lLW1ha2Vycy1rZWVwLXRyeWluZy10by1wYXRlbnQtaG9ycmlmeWluZy1zZWF0aW5nLWFycmFuZ2VtZW50cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane maker Airbus filed a patent for a seating design that would literally stack passengers on top of each other. If it ever makes it to market, the layout could turn planes into a complex game of human Tetris. The whole thing basically sounds something thought up by The Onion. And in fact, it was.

But this isn't the first time Airbus seating proposals have made flying seem like some form of modern torture. Last year, the company made headlines for filing a patent for a bicycle-like ""sitting"" arrangement that certainly didn't look like it would be comfortable over a long-haul flight.

And Airbus isn't alone: One major airline seat manufacturer grabbed attention in July after filing a patent for a honeycomb like setup that would leave passengers sitting knee to knee.

But plane designers aren't exploring these options just to make people uncomfortable. Instead, blame the democratization of flying.

Taking a plane trip has gotten an awful lot cheaper over the last 30 years, which is great because more people than ever are able to travel long distances to take vacations and see loved ones. But with the rise of less expensive flights and discount airlines, profit margins have gotten thinner. And one way operators can keep prices low is stuffing more people on a plane.

That's why airline seats keep shrinking.

But there's a limit to how narrow you can make a chair. If the industry wants to continue to expand the market of who can afford to fly, even more compromises will probably have to be made."

Named, very technically, “Passenger Seat Arrangement For A Vehicle” the patent features not just rows but layers of seats. While primarily designed for airplanes, the patent helpfully notes that it is suitable for other means of passenger transport, like buses or trains.

While most airplanes are already densely packed, the patent observes that wide-body airplanes (think Boeing Jumbo Jets or the Airbus 330 family) aren’t utilized to their full economic potential. From the patent:

It looks like this:

For now, this seating arrangement is just an Airbus patent, and there’s no guarantee that it will work its way into a future airplane design. If it does, we can at least be thankful that passengers won’t be responsible for rowing the flight. Yet."
Airbus A350-900ULR enables Singapore Airlines to reopen Singapore-New York - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC8xMy9haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDB1bHItZW5hYmxlcy1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtdG8tcmVvcGVuLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1uZXcteW9yay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton and Bjorn Fehrm

Oct. 13 2015, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus and Singapore Airlines have launched the A350-900 ultra long range, the specifications for which we estimated in July beginning with the first of four articles.

The A350-900ULR enables Singapore Airlines to reopen the Singapore-New York “SQ flight 21” that was closed 23 November 2013. It was the world’s longest flight, using an Airbus A340-500 until SQ discontinued it during the more recent high fuel prices that rendered the flight uneconomic.

Update: Singapore has now released this picture through twitter:

It will also enable Singapore to restart direct flights to the US West Coast, something that the main competition, such as Cathay Pacific Airways, has been able to offer because of a better geographical position. The A350-900ULR now closes that competitive gap for Singapore Airlines.

Singapore has converted seven of its A350-900s to the -900ULR version, deliveries will start in 2018. The ULR will be in a custom premium configuration of 170 seats, about 60 more than used on the A340-500.

A350-900ULR

As we described in the July articles (links below), it is a standard A350-900 which is extended with moderate modifications to enable it to fly up to 19 hours. Main changes are an additional five tonnes Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW) increase from the presently certified 275t variant to a 280t variant. This is paired with wing tank changes derived from the A350-1000 version to allow a maximum of 165,000 l of fuel to be tanked (standard A350-900 now 141,000l, up from 138,000l).

Update 2: We have got further fuel system info from Airbus. The wingbox of the A350 is roomy. There is room for the 141,000l (new info) of the standard A350-900, the 156,000l of the A350-1000 and indeed the 165,000l of the A350-900ULR. It is all a matter of where the fuel computer and its sensors put the volume cut-off for the different fuel compartments and how routing of inert gas etc. gets adapted to the higher levels. So all the same base wingbox, just utilized to different levels.

By using a lighter cabin than normal—the 170 seats–this allows more fuel to be filled, which opens up the 19 hours endurance needed to reach the US West Coast on a windy day or the famous non-stop flight between Singapore and New York.

Singapore Airlines’ need for Ultra Long Haul

Like its predecessor, the new H145 Mercedes-Benz Style is tailored for high-end private and corporate operations. It offers a versatile and stylish cabin that has been upgraded to fulfil the highest expectations in terms of refinement, comfort and quality.

“Inspired by the top-of-the-range vehicles of the brand with the star, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers a redesigned cabin interior that includes in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, an improved infotainment system and new seat design for increased ergonomic comfort,” said Frederic Lemos, Airbus Helicopters’ head of private and business aviation Europe. “Customers wishing to further personalize their aircraft will be able to work directly with Airbus Helicopters and the creative design teams at Mercedes-Benz Style to define their unique cabin environment.”

The aircraft is proposed in three different harmonies that customers can combine with a real wooden floor or a choice of sophisticated carpets. The interior liners and the new light concept also contribute to the elegant and welcoming interior atmosphere. Multi-purpose storage is made possible by numerous attachment points on the floor and walls and a new and perfectly integrated cabinet, offering increased storage volume.

With its unrivalled modular interior, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers extreme cabin arrangement flexibility for a broad range of travels: executive transportation, exploration tourism, family voyages, as well as leisure and sport trips. All seats, galley and walls are mounted on rails and can be easily reconfigured from four to eight passengers – or removed to transport more luggage or large items. The aircraft is extremely compact making it also the ideal choice for super yacht owners.

Offering the widest range of helicopters for private and business operations, Airbus Helicopters is the market leader with more than 400 helicopters sold in the last five years in this segment."
Airbus takes fight to Boeing - Professional Engineering,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXRha2VzLWZpZ2h0LXRvLWJvZWluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Articles

Airbus has taken the fight to Boeing by establishing its first production facility in the US. PE visits the plant and finds the European planemaker in bullish mood

A phrase commonly heard in the US when discussing matters to do with aviation was “if it ain’t Boeing, I ain’t going”. Those few words neatly encapsulated long-held parochialism and suspicion of overseas aerospace suppliers, with an unhealthy dash of xenophobia mixed in.

Fortunately, over time, things have changed. Nowadays it is recognised that foreign aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus are capable of producing aircraft that are every bit as good as those made by Boeing in Seattle, and that competition improves customer choice.

Winning orders

This sea-change in attitude has led to Airbus winning several multimillion-dollar orders from American airlines such as Delta, United and JetBlue, with no adverse passenger reaction.

Emboldened by this opening of market opportunity, Airbus has made a real statement of intent by constructing its first US-based production facility, in Mobile, Alabama. The $600-million site will produce four A320 single-aisle aircraft per month from 2017, with that number eventually rising to eight planes per month to meet strong demand.

The Mobile factory serves two main purposes. Firstly, it allows Airbus to ramp up production of the A320, which is now produced at its plants in Hamburg in Germany, Toulouse in France, and Tianjin in China. Those facilities are bursting at the seams, and the Mobile factory brings much needed capacity. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the new plant gives Airbus closer links to the US, which is still the world’s biggest market for single-aisle aircraft. It also allows Airbus to claim that its planes are ‘made in America’ – and that still means something to US airlines, which are expected to swallow Mobile’s entire output each year.

Charles Champion, Airbus’ executive vice-president of engineering, explains the rationale behind the setting up of the Mobile plant. “We have got to be close to our customers,” he says. “This global expansion started in China and now we are here in the US. It will help us grow our market here. Our customers are excited that

we are assembling aircraft on US soil.”

But in a truly globalised market, does it really matter where planes are actually made? “Our US customers appreciate it. When they select an aircraft, they don’t always look exactly where it is manufactured. But they are proud to take an aircraft out of the US,” he says.

However, one worry is that increasing expansion in the US could mean a lessening commitment to European plants in places such as Broughton, in north Wales. Champion refutes that suggestion. “The closer we are to our customers, the more we sell aircraft. That’s what happened in China. So overall, the activity of the workers who are assembling the wings in Broughton is going to be higher.”

The rise in activity has already started, he says. “Already we have increased the rate up to 50 A320s a month – nobody would have dreamt of that a few years ago. We have thousands of planes in the order book; there is plenty of work ahead, both in Europe but also in the US.”

By planting a flag so firmly in American soil, Airbus is challenging Boeing in its own backyard. But Champion seems unconcerned about how its expansionism is perceived by its US arch-rival. “I don’t worry about Boeing – I worry that my customers are happy,” he says with a smile.

Previous plans

Mobile was originally selected by Airbus as the location for a military aircraft facility that would have built air tankers based on the A330 for the US Air Force. The town is well placed, strategically, with good transport links and a saltwater port. Airbus won the tanker bid, initially, but the decision was controversially overturned after outrage in Capitol Hill over a foreign supplier being chosen to produce planes for the US military. Airbus, and Mobile, were left high and dry.

But the European company had formed strong links with Mobile’s trade officials and politicians, and it always said that it would one day be back to start building aircraft in the town. The new A320 assembly facility has proved Airbus to be true to its word.

The layout of the Mobile plant is based on the company’s existing A320 family assembly lines in Hamburg and Tianjin. Overall, the supply stream for components will remain mostly the same. Fully equipped sections of aircraft, including the wings from the UK, will be shipped by sea and road to the plant. Meanwhile, other major components will be packaged at Airbus’ logistics centre in Hamburg, before being sent by ship or air to the US.

The first thing you notice about the new plant is its sheer size – it’s located on a 470,000m2 site, comprising two gigantic production halls, making it visible for miles around. The facility will be responsible for the assembly of all big aircraft components, resulting in the production of a complete aircraft. In Mobile, those aircraft will be the A319, A320 and A321, all single-aisle with identical wingspan and fuselage diameters, but with different fuselage lengths. This set-up allows seat number flexibility for different airline customers.

All the main component assemblies – fuselage, wings, and the vertical and horizontal tailplanes – arrive from Airbus’ European plants via cargo ships on journeys that will take around 20 days. Smaller, US-produced systems and components will arrive via air or land transport.

Stagewise production

The main production hall is set up with clear flow lines, allowing partially assembled aircraft sections to move forward station by station. The final assembly starts with the fuselage, with the forward and aft sections joined using more than 3,000 rivets.

Both fuselage sections are supplied fully equipped, with all tubes, ducts and cables for electrical, hydraulic and air-

conditioning systems already installed, and waiting to be connected subsequent to assembly of the two sections. Because of their size, lavatories and galleys are pushed into the still open fuselage sections, that are already fitted with floors, before the sections are joined.

The next step is the installation of the parallel electrical system and of the cargo loading system.

After completion of the work and a thorough quality check, the entire fuselage – the so-called ‘cigar’ – is winched forward to the next station by overhead crane. Here, high-precision electronic instruments are used to position the wings on the fuselage, and then the rivet holes are drilled with the aid of templates and automatic drilling units. Fuselage and wings are separated again, cleaned, and sealing compound is applied, before they are then rejoined with an accuracy of 0.1mm. Each of the wings, weighing 4.5 tonnes, requires the drilling of 1,200 rivets.

Once the wing-to-fuselage connection is completed, the landing gear installation

is checked, and then the pylons carrying the engines are assembled.

When the onboard computer has been installed, the aircraft is supplied with electrical power for the first time. A plug is connected to the aircraft, and with ‘electrical power on’, system testing can begin. The assembly of the main and nose landing gear is also carried out at this station. Then, supported on its wheels for the first time, the aircraft moves to the next station.

This stage is where the aircraft is fitted with the vertical and horizontal stabilisers and the tail cone. In addition, the inner flaps and the main landing gear doors are installed. The aircraft nose, the radome, is also brought together at this point. As electromagnetic waves from the antenna must penetrate the radome, it is made of maintenance-free composite material and weighs just 44lb (19.96kg). The weather radar and the antenna for the aircraft’s suite of sophisticated navigation instruments are installed behind the radome.

Next is the auxiliary power unit. Later, it will supply the aircraft with electrical and hydraulic power and hot air as long as the engines are not running. The auxiliary power unit is also needed to start the engines. Inside the aircraft, cabin installation begins here. This process requires the fitting out of overhead stowage compartments, service channels, side wall and ceiling panels, door and door-frame linings, the cockpit safety door and cargo compartment linings.

Extensive tests are also carried out at this station. The air-conditioning system is put through its paces and the mechanical flight controls are tested, as is the tail cone. The first ‘power on’ for the hydraulic system also happens here.

Cabin takes shape

The final assembly-line stop is the dock station. Here, the aircraft’s cabin begins to take shape: the seats are installed and the floor is covered with carpet. The main tasks in the dock are the function and systems tests. The landing gear is lowered. The lighting, audio and video systems and cabin pressurisation systems are tested.

At this stage the assembled aircraft leaves the facility, ready for the paint shop. The last stop is the flight line hangar. The cabin is completely furnished, and the quality inspection of the cabin and cockpit is carried out by the customer.

The engines and the engine cowlings are now installed, being hoisted up with a special crane and attached to the pylons with nine bolts. All connections between the aircraft and the engines, including electrical power, compressed air, flight control and de-icing systems, are made.

The aircraft is then prepared for handover to the customer, with final payment made on acceptance. Flight testing is carried out, and engine run-ups performance and taxi-ing and braking tests completed. Only after a batch of sign-off tests are completed is the aircraft given the go-ahead for its first flight.

The aim is to get the Mobile factory up to speed, producing four aircraft a month, by 2017. But this rate could be doubled, with limited capital expenditure, to eight aircraft per month, should demand dictate. The Mobile site is surrounded by empty land, and Airbus hasn’t ruled out one day putting another programme into the facility.

Ironically, it is a British engineer, Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas, who is ultimately responsible for the success of the Mobile plant. Eccleston, who was educated at Loughborough University and started his career as a flight test engineer at Rolls-Royce, says the Mobile plant has been modelled on Airbus’ existing A320 facility, and that this provides a template for operational success.

Formula that works

“We are using the same process as we have in Hamburg, which is also what we do in Tianjin in China. We know it works. So we are doing it here. That’s enabled us to be on time, on budget and on quality,” he says. “When the plant is up and running, we will be looking for ways that we can insert new manufacturing technology.”

He says the US workforce have quickly learnt the Airbus way of doing things. “The first job for the 230 people we have here was to go to Hamburg and work on the shopfloor for several months. They were learning the Airbus way of building aeroplanes. They picked it up quickly.”

Eccleston is proud that Airbus has established itself in the US, and thinks it can only benefit sales. “An airline buying process comprises 101 different things. It’s about availability, it’s performance, it’s commercial times, it’s financing. But somewhere in all of that, we think, is the question of whether or not the plane has been ‘made in America’,” he says.

“If it was a dead heat, then historically an airline may have gone with Boeing because only its aeroplanes were ‘made in America’. Now that argument no longer applies.”

Did you know? Airbus' US footprint



Airbus employs a total of 1,400 workers in the US. As well as the Mobile plant, it has a design and engineering centre in Wichita, Kansas, employing around 340 engineers. It also has two sites in Virginia – a sales and marketing office in Herndon and a 24-hour spares centre in Ashburn. Slowly but surely, the company is becoming a truly global player, threatening Boeing’s market share.

The paint shop at the Mobile facility has been supplied by Irish firm MAAS Aviation. The process starts with docking and preparation of the airframe, including sanding, masking of areas that will not be painted, and surface cleaning. After these steps, the painting process starts with three coatings being applied to the fuselage: primer, top coat – including the airline colours – and a clear coat. Around 250 litres of paint and 15.5 miles (24.9km) of masking tape are used for each plane. The control of air temperature and humidity is crucial. An air-handling unit moves 90,000ft3 (2,548.5m3) of air every minute, with eight air circulations every hour. It takes around six days to paint an A320, but this can run to much longer if the customer’s livery is complex."
Airbus Files Patent That Shows Airplane Passengers Stacked On Top of Each Other - Entrepreneur,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vbGl2aW5nL2FpcmJ1cy1maWxlcy1wYXRlbnQtdGhhdC1zaG93cy1haXJwbGFuZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXN0YWNrZWQvMjUxNDU30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

""Ladies and gentlemen, if you're seated above another passenger, please try your best not to kick them in the face during the flight."" This ridiculous in-flight announcement could become a reality if Airbus's latest crazy seating arrangement concept comes to fruition.

The French aerospace manufacturer recently filed a patent for an overhead seating design that would pack people even tighter into planes. The images in the patent show an uncanny split-level cabin concept, one that would have business class passengers stacked on top of one another, like the contents of ""a mile-high submarine sandwich,"" as TravelPulse so perfectly puts it.

The arrangement would push passengers within inches of the ceiling of the plane, enabling yet more precious cargo to board economy flights, forcing us to smell each other even more up close and personal. At least the upper-tier seats could recline up to 180 degrees, though they look nowhere near as cozy and cool as Air Lair's futuristic A380 seating dream.

""In modern means of transport, in particular in aircraft, it is very important from an economic point of view to make optimum use of the available space in a passenger cabin,"" Airbus wrote in the patent application. Because of course this is about making more money. It's high time airlines cash in on the vertical space they waste.

Could this be the future of flight? Is the company planning to one day build this awful seating arrangement? We contacted Airbus to find out, but have yet to hear back. Before you recoil imagining the many awkward possibilities, know that Airbus files around 600 or so patents a year, many of which never turn into squat. In the case of this Star Trek Enterprise-like ""Flying Donuts"" Airbus patent, it's really too bad. We'd be down for that sweet, spacey ride.

Airbus envisions a hypersonic plane that can fly from New York to London in 1 hour - Futurism,"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1lbnZpc2lvbnMtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1wbGFuZS10aGF0LWNhbi1mbHktZnJvbS1uZXcteW9yay10by1sb25kb24taW4tMS1ob3Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Concorde 2

A patent awarded to Airbus in July showed designs of an aircraft that climbs vertically into the air before breaking the sound barrier as it travels horizontally across the sky. Airbus envisions its hypersonic plane - dubbed the Concorde 2 - to have a top speed of Mach 4.5, or three times faster than the legendary supersonic passenger jet. It will cut travel time from New York to London to just one hour, from the four hours it took the original Concorde which made its final flight in 2003. Standard airliners usually take eight hours travel time between the two cities. The proposed aircraft is described as ""an air vehicle including a fuselage, a gothic delta wing distributed on either side of the fuselage, and a system of motors able to propel the air vehicle."" There would be 3 types of engines involved, powered by different forms of hydrogen, that work together to propel the vehicle at speeds of up to 3,425 mph. It would climb vertically at take-off assisted by two turbo jets that would retract into the fuselage just before it reaches the speed of sound. A rocket motor would take it to a cruising altitude of 100,000 feet, then wing-mounted ramjets would then take control to push the aircraft to its final speed. Airbus says the plane's aerodynamic design will limit its sonic boom, making it much quieter the Concorde. However, because of design considerations the hypersonic craft is envisaged to carry only 20 passengers, principally VIP and business travelers who need transcontinental trips within a day.

Military application

Airbus says the hypersonic jet could also be used for military applications, working to transport soldiers at rapid speeds. Research into the use of hypersonic transport has been in the works. In July, the US Air Force revealed they hope to have a hypersonic plane capable of crossing countries in minutes and that several tests of hypersonic projectiles have already been undertaken. Air Force Chief Scientist Mica Endsley said that the Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) plan to have a new and improved hypersonic air vehicle by 2023."

Finnair became the first airline in Europe and the third in the world to begin flying Airbus' new-age A350 jet. The carrier made its first regular passenger flight on the jet Friday on a route between Helsinki and Amsterdam. Finnair's first A350 flight came just two days after the airline took delivery of the jet at a ceremony at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

The A350 is the first of 19 ordered by the Finnish flag carrier. The jet initially will fly on intra-European routes before shifting to long-haul service on Nov. 21, when Finnair begins using the A350 for its service between Helsinki and Shanghai.

The airline plans to launch A350 flights to the USA by the end of the year, using the aircraft on the New York JFK-Helsinki route.

""Finnair has enjoyed a long and prosperous working relationship with Airbus and the A350 takes our cooperation to another level. This aircraft is the future of flying and will give our passengers a completely new and enhanced travel experience,"" Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo says in a statement.

The A350 is a mid-sized widebody geared to long-haul routes. Its passenger-friendly enhancements include larger windows, lower cabin humidity and more comfortable pressurization levels. Finnair is outfitting its initial A350s in a three-class configuration, seating 46 in business class, 43 in economy comfort and 208 in economy a total of 297 passengers.

Finnair's A350s will add to the carrier's all-Airbus fleet. The other aircraft in Finnair's line-up include 15 A330 and A340 long-haul wide-body jets and 30 A320-family narrowbody aircraft.

Wednesday's (Oct. 7) delivery made Finnair the first European airline to take the A350. Globally, Finnair is the third airline to take Airbus' most modern jet. Qatar Airways became the first in the world to fly it, taking delivery of its A350 in December of 2014 and putting it into scheduled passenger service a month later.

Vietnam Airlines became the world's second airline to get an A350 in June."
Airbus and Boeing swing it out at ISTAT Europe 2015 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC8wNy9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1zd2luZy1pdC1vdXQtYXQtaXN0YXQtZXVyb3BlLTIwMTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

07 October 2015, ©. Leeham Co: This year’s ISTAT Europe conference had been characterized by a “Steady as you go” ambiance until the traditional match between Airbus and Boeing on “Large aircraft segment” panel got going. This is normally when things can get a bit more exiting and this year’s version did not disappoint.

Airbus’ Mark Perman-Wright, Head corporate and Investor marketing, kicked off the jabbing during his coverage of all the usual segments, claiming that Boeing got to know that Airbus held the upper hand in just about all airliner segments.

Randy Tinseth, Vice President Marketing for Boeing, immediately responded that this was all wrong and that indeed Boeing was the market leader in all imaginable measurement dimensions.

The audience of 1.200 financiers, lessors, airlines, consultants, etc., could see that a drastically lower fuel price had changed nothing. Airbus’ and Boeing’s fight over the market dominance, both real and verbal, is as fierce as ever. As we could get a hold of Boeing’s presentation and both OEMs followed the same route through their product programs we will use Tinseth’s slides as a base for our ringside review.

Both OEMs choose to start with their weakest segment, the VLAs. Their focus was colored by where they had business, with Boeing describing their recent order for 747-8F and other freighters:

Airbus focused its part on how much better the A380 is getting without changing engines. Through several cabin programs, the operator would gain $23m in revenue on a yearly basis given increased cabin density and re-position of galleys etc. It is clear that both OEMs have disappointing sales in this market and therefore give the segment prime exposure during any customer facing activity.

Next up was widebodys. Airbus proved that they had outsold Boeing in the 300 seat widebody field by 561 airplanes since the 787-9 was launched in April 2004. They achieved that by bundling A330-300, -900 and A350-900 sales to a total of 1,255 orders. Boeing has in the same time sold 691 787-9, -10 and 777-8X said Airbus.

Our comments are that the 777-8X does not belong here; it is a competitor to the A350-1000 at the 350 seat level. Furthermore, 300 seats is a bit narrow, normally the segment would be 250-300 seats and the A330-200/-800 and 787-8 would be counted in. That would change the picture to more of a 50:50 basis. If one goes 300-350 seats instead, the 777-300ER sales of 700-800 units in the period would tip the balance in Boeing’s favour versus the A350-1000’s 172 orders.

Boeing focused the segment time on its success with the 787. Here a slide with some key numbers:

Boeing then chose to go on attack regarding the perceived insufficient range of the 787-10. Tinseth showed this picture, which establishes that Airbus has a much larger problem with its widebody portfolio regarding range that does Boeing with the 787-10:

Tinseth’s argument was that all 787 aircraft are long range and they fly further than the competition. In a subsequent discussion, Airbus and Boeing agreed that Boeing has been the stronger in the widebody market but Airbus disputes that this will continue now that it has A350 and A330neo.

Finally the parties got to the single aisle corner of the ring. Here things got a bit muddy. Pearman-Wright showed how Boeing’s 737 MAX has gotten 3.1t heavier whereas the A320neo has stayed at 1.6t for the Pratt&Whitney’s GTF and 1.9t with CFM’s LEAP. “When they start as the same level, the MAX then is heavier,” continues Pearman-Wright.

This is the key, they don’t. There is plenty of data out there (Turkish Airlines fleet sheets for their A320 and 787-800 being one source) that show the 737NG is considerably lighter than an A320ceo.

Pearman-Wright then focus on the fact that the P&W A320neo has confirmed weight, -15% fuel consumption and can take-off with up to 2t higher take-off weight. He said delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways will happen before year end.

Tinseth said large 737 operators like RyanAir have not ordered their replacement 737NGs yet. The MAX therefore has a large captive market still not harvested:

Tinseth’s argument was that the MAX has an operator base which is more conservative with orders (RyanAir, Soutwest), whereas Airbus has booked mega orders for carriers with relatively small to no A320 fleets (Indigo, Norwegian). This increases the risk of overbooking by Airbus.

In summary, the only thing one can get these OEMs to agree on is that they cannot agree on anything of substance in the market. I guess that is how it should be.

Malaysia Airlines To Replace London A380s with A350s | AIN - Aviation International News,"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpbm9ubGluZS5jb20vYXZpYXRpb24tbmV3cy9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0LzIwMTUtMTAtMTkvbWFsYXlzaWEtYWlybGluZXMtcmVwbGFjZS1sb25kb24tYTM4MHMtYTM1MHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Malaysia Airlines To Replace London A380s with A350s

Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 refurb shows the airline’s direction - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTAvbHVmdGhhbnNhcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1yZWZ1cmItc2hvd3MtdGhlLWFpcmxpbmVzLWRpcmVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five years after receiving its first Airbus A380 aircraft, Lufthansa has completed refitting its entire fleet with fully flat business class seats, premium economy and inflight connectivity. During a summertime tour of D-AIMN in Lufthansa Technik’s Frankfurt hangar, RGN took a fine-toothed comb to the passenger experience improvements (and what could be considered a few missed opportunities) in the airline’s refurbished version of the world’s largest passenger aircraft.

With first class remaining at the front of the upper deck, the biggest change on board the A380 is in business class, where Lufthansa’s significantly outdated angled lie-flat seats — some of the least comforable examples of their kind — have been replaced with fully flat beds.

Notably, the A380’s configuration is akin to the arrangement on the airline’s Airbus widebodies and refurbished Boeing 747-400 jets, rather than its Boeing 747-8I, on which the seat was premiered (and rapidly nicknamed “footsie class”).

Lufthansa refers to its two versions of the seat’s pairs as H (parallel with each other but at a slight angle away from the aircraft centreline) or V (angled towards each other).

The A380’s upstairs business class cabin is very similar indeed to the A330 and A340 cross-sections, which were installed with an H V H arrangement, rather than the V V V of the 747-8I. The refitted 747-400 also contains an H V H layout.

Apart from the relief at no longer playing footsie with the middle manager from Stuttgart sitting in the next seat, the big benefit of the H seat pairs is that the window passenger is able to step out over the aisle passenger when the beds are both flat. The pointed footrests of the V version end up with just a few centimetres between them — not enough to get a foot on the floor.

Compare the lack of anywhere to stand on the V seat configuration:

With the (small but workable) space on the H seat configuration:

The A380’s new business class cabin is smaller in number of seats, as expected when an airline transitions from an angled lie-flat seat to a fully flat bed, although the drop is only from 98 to 92 passengers when the entire rear section of the upper deck is in business mode.

Yet the airline is continuing to use the wider efficiencies and economies of scale from its Lufthansa Technik MRO operator to adjust the split between business and economy according to demand. On the A380, fourteen business class seats at the rear can be removed to make for a business cabin of 78 seats in total, while 35 extra economy seats are added in the usual 2-4-2 layout of an upper deck A380 economy cabin.

This is a much more elegant solution than on board the Boeing 747-8I, which goes first-business-economy-premium-economy, or on the 747-400, which goes business-economy-premium-economy when configured with the low-business, high-economy layout.

Back upstairs on the A380, some travelers may deem it unfortunate that Lufthansa hasn’t added any new cabin monuments or sound baffles in the large center business class cabin. With the quiet of the A380 and the open style seating Lufthansa chose, a large cabin is a recipe for a noisy snorefest after a plate of Maultaschen and a couple of Augustiner Weißbiers.

And throughout, it’s notable that Lufthansa hasn’t taken the opportunity of a refit to enlarge the swing-up overhead bins into swing-down pivot bins, as on Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Etihad and Korean Air, among others.

Downstairs, the big change is a large 52-seat premium economy cabin in the entire front cabin between doors 1 and 2. By contrast, the 747-400 and 747-8I have just 32 premium economy seats, which do not fill a full zone in either aircraft. Lufthansa would seem to be making a big statement about its confidence in premium economy with this refit.

Taken separately, each of Lufthansa’s decisions in its refit Airbus A380 aircraft is an interesting one, but together, they show a number of trends in the airline: maintaining first class despite removing it from some older aircraft, a clear positioning for business class with a hard product that is strategically differentiated from first, betting big on premium economy, and continuing its successful business-economy cabin flexibility."

[Photo/Agencies]

Airbus Helicopters Inc, a unit of Airbus Group SE, said on Friday that China will buy 100 H135 helicopters over the next 10 years as part of a deal to set up a final assembly line in Qingdao, Shandong province.

The company said the deal gives it an edge in China, one of the fastest-growing global markets for helicopters. The deal is worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), according to a report from Reuters.

The European company signed a cooperation letter of intent with the Qingdao-based Sino-Germany Eco Park where the final assembly line will be based during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China.

Airbus Helicopters will build a complete ecosystem in China, including a final assembly line, a sales team for China-assembled H135s, as well as employing support staff for maintenance and training services, the helicopter maker said in a statement.

""This is a significant development that will help increase our market share and also provide proven and certified solutions in the Chinese market,"" said Norbert Ducrot, Airbus Helicopters' China president.

Airbus Helicopters already has a 40 percent share of the Chinese civil helicopter market, he said. The H135 helicopter is a light helicopter with two engines and is mainly used for emergency medical services and police work. Airbus Helicopters has delivered 1,200 H135 helicopters globally.

Statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that the number of civil helicopters in the country increased from 387 in 2013 to 524 in 2014, a 37.5 percent year-on-year growth.

""The number of Chinese civil helicopters is growing, although the quantity is still small,"" Yin Shijun, director of CAAC's airworthiness certification division, said at the China Heli-Expo in September. Airbus Helicopters also received orders for more than 110 helicoptters from three Chinese clients at the China Heli-Expo."

Airbus Helicopters Inc. announced that California Shock Trauma and Rescue (CALSTAR) has ordered five H135 air medical helicopters. CALSTAR is the first U.S. customer for this significantly improved and updated variant of the most popular twin-engine helicopter chosen by air medical transport service operators.

The order announcement was made Monday in a ceremony at the Airbus Helicopters Inc. booth on the opening day of the Air Medical Transport Conference in Long Beach. CALSTAR, based in Sacramento, Calif. is one of the nation’s leading air medical service providers and a long-time operator of Airbus helicopters.

“We are honored that an outstanding air medical transport and emergency medical services provider such as CALSTAR continues to place their trust in Airbus Helicopters aircraft and services,” said Chris Emerson, president of Airbus Helicopters Inc. and head of the North America Region. “CALSTAR is one of the many air medical providers that continue to choose Airbus Helicopters aircraft and contribute to our success as the market leader in this vital segment of the industry.”

CALSTAR selected the H135 (formerly EC135 P3) following a fly off with competing models that included tests in late summer heat and high altitude. CALSTAR flies many of its critical patient transports in the Sierra Nevada range and nearby foothills.

“CALSTAR followed a very rigorous review process that included a detailed analysis by third party expert Conklin & de Decker Associates and hands-on trials by our pilots and flight nurses,” said Lynn D. Malmstrom, president and CEO. “The H135 became the clear leader after we were able to test its capabilities in our unique high/hot operating environment.”

The new H135s will replace CALSTAR’s remaining four legacy BO105LS helicopters. The first H135s are expected to go into service in the spring of 2016. This aircraft acquisition represents the conclusion of a fleet modernization plan launched in 2012.

The H135 recently received Federal Aviation Administration type certification for operation in the U.S. The H135 is the industry reference for light twin-engine helicopters due to its performance, safety features, operating efficiency and cabin flexibility. CALSTAR currently operates eight EC135s, the previous version, that it ordered in 2012.

Equipped with Pratt & Whitney PW206B3 turbine engines and a new, larger main rotor, the H135 provides 440 pounds of greater payload capacity in hot-and-high operating conditions. It also has improved performance and payload at lower altitudes.

The H135 has several new or improved safety features. Its modern glass cockpit includes the Garmin GTN 750 fully integrated navigation, communication and GPS avionics system. This system allows enhanced operation under instrument flight rules (IFR), improving safety margins at night, or in hazardous weather and terrain. The H135 also has excellent one-engine inoperative (OEI) performance. The helicopter is equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), fire detectors, transmission chip detectors with quick-disconnect plugs, and a crash-resistant fuel system.

More than 1,200 versions of the H135/EC135 family are in operation globally and have accumulated a total of more than three million flight hours. The model is a worldwide favorite of air medical transport services. Previous versions can be fully retrofitted to bring them up to the technical level of the H135."
Airbus' Concorde 2 that could fly from New York to London in an hour revealed - Daily Mail,"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc2NpZW5jZXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS0zMjY5NDI5L0lzLWZ1dHVyZS1oeXBlcnNvbmljLXRyYXZlbC1EZXNpZ25lci1yZXZlYWxzLXZpc2lvbi1Db25jb3JkZS0yLWZseS1OZXctWW9yay1Mb25kb24tanVzdC1vbmUtaG91ci5odG1s0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9zY2llbmNldGVjaC9hcnRpY2xlLTMyNjk0MjkvYW1wL0lzLWZ1dHVyZS1oeXBlcnNvbmljLXRyYXZlbC1EZXNpZ25lci1yZXZlYWxzLXZpc2lvbi1Db25jb3JkZS0yLWZseS1OZXctWW9yay1Mb25kb24tanVzdC1vbmUtaG91ci5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It looks like a futuristic craft from the children's TV series Thunderbirds, but this sleek design could actually be for a Concorde-2 hypersonic airliner.

The designs are based on a patent awarded to Airbus in July, which describes a craft that climbs vertically into the air before breaking the sound barrier as it travels horizontally across the sky.

Dubbed Concorde-2 because it would be much faster and quieter than the retired supersonic jet, the plane is designed to have a top speed of Mach 4.5, meaning a journey from New York to London would take just one hour.

Scroll down for videos

An aircraft dubbed 'Concorde Two' may resemble a spacecraft with an A-wing according to illustrations based on a patent awarded to Airbus in July, which describes a craft that climbs vertically in the air before breaking the sound barrier as it travels horizontally

Airbus hopes its planned hypersonic jet, which would travel at 4.5 times the speed of sound, could take people between two major cities faster than most daily commutes.

Its proposed one-hour journey time between New York and London would be more than three times faster than the original Concorde, which made its final flight in 2003. Standard airliners take around eight hours to complete the journey.

Airbus' jet is described as 'an air vehicle including a fuselage, a gothic delta wing distributed on either side of the fuselage, and a system of motors able to propel the air vehicle'.

These details have been taken into account in the computer-generated illustrations shown on Patent Yogi's YouTube channel, where the proposed craft is described as 'the highest rollercoaster in the world' because of the steep ascent and descent - and high speed - of its flight path.

Airbus hopes its planned hypersonic jet could take people between two major cities faster than most daily commutes and it will be quieter than Concorde because it will create less of a sonic boom (illustrated)

HOW WOULD IT REACH MACH 4.5? The patent describes how three different types of engine, powered by different form of hydrogen, would work together to propel the vehicle at speeds of 3,425mph (5,500km/h). Two turbo jets would allow the jet to climb vertically at take-off, before retracting into the fuselage just before it reaches the speed of sound. A rocket motor would then take it to an altitude of 100,000ft (30,000 metres). The wing-mounted ramjets would then take control to push the jet to its final speed.

A rocket motor would take it to an altitude of 100,000 feet (30,000 metres). The wing-mounted ramjets would then take control to push the jet to its final speed.

Airbus says it has designed the craft's aerodynamics to limit sonic boom, making it much quieter than Concorde, which some complained was too noisy when it flew over populated areas.

However, unlike with Concorde, the Airbus design will limit passengers to just 20. And it won't be cheap.

'In the case of civil applications, the market envisaged is principally that of business travel and VIP passengers, who require transcontinental return journeys within one day,' the patent states.

A trip from London to New York could take just one hour if Airbus has its way. Pictured is a illustration of what it could look like from a recent patent application, inlcluding rotating fins

The patent describes how three different types of engine, powered by different forms of hydrogen, would work together to propel the vehicle at speeds of 3,425mph (5,500km/h) or 4.5 Mach (illustrated above)

The craft would take off vertically before breaking the sound barrier horizontally and making a steep descent again. Patent Yogi's YouTube channel, where the illustrations come from, have described Airbus's planned plane as 'the highest roller coaster in the world' because of its unusual proposed path

Airbus claims the jet would be able to complete trips such as Tokyo to Los Angeles in just three hours.

The aircraft manufacturer says the hypersonic jet could also be used for military applications, working to transport soldiers at rapid speeds.

Another smaller aerospace firm called Aerion Corp has partnered with Airbus to develop another supersonic business jet - the AS2.

The jet is tipped to fly at 1,217 mph and would be made of carbon-composite material.

This compares to modern commercial long-haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480 and 560 mph.

Brian Barents, co-chairman of Aerion Corp, told BizJournals he hopes the $120 million jet will come to market by 2022.

Aerion is talking to governing bodies in the US about the issue of noise regulations so it's more likely the jet could fly over the mainland.

He believes a renaissance of supersonic civil travel is on the horizon.

But Airbus isn't the only one vying to create hypersonic aircraft technology, with a new generation of planes expected to take to the skies in just over a decade.

Airbus says it has designed the craft's aerodynamics (illustrated) to limit sonic boom, making it much quieter than Concorde, which some complained was too noisy when it flew over land

Three different types of engine, powered by different form of hydrogen, would work together to propel the vehicle at speeds of 3,425mph (5,500km/h) according to the patent (one image from it is shown)

In July, US Air Force bosses revealed they hope to have a hypersonic plane capable of crossing countries in minutes by 2023 and that several tests of hypersonic projectiles have already been carried out.

Air Force Chief Scientist Mica Endsley told Military.com that the Air Force and Darpa, the Pentagon's research entity, plan to have a new and improved hypersonic air vehicle by 2023.

Experimental unmanned aircraft developed for the US Air Force have already gone hypersonic during tests off the Southern California coast, flying at more than five times the speed of sound.

The Air Force said a craft known as the X-51A WaveRider flew for more than three minutes under power from its exotic scramjet engine and hit a speed of Mach 5.1 last year.

The new air vehicle could be used to transport sensors, equipment or weaponry in the future, depending upon how the technology develops.

Previously bosses had only said they hoped that missile systems would be available for testing in 2020.

Another smaller aerospace firm called Aerion Corp has partnered with Airbus to develop another supersonic business jet - the AS2 (illustrated). The jet is tipped to fly at 1,217 mph (1,959 km/h)

Airbus says it has designed the craft's aerodynamics to limit sonic boom, which was a major problem for Concorde when it flew over land. A cross-section of the planned futuristic plane is shown above

Passengers on the aircraft will be limited to 20 ( a possible seating arrangement is shown). Airbus says the hypersonic jet could also be for military applications, working to transport soldiers at rapid speeds"

How Airbus Plans to Reach Space With An Engineless Plane - Digital Trends,"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Nvb2wtdGVjaC9haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLXByb2plY3QtZW5naW5lbGVzcy1wbGFuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If nobody had told me beforehand that the Perlan 2 glider plane was about to make history, I never would’ve guessed there was anything special about it.

As I watched it gently lift off from the runway at Roberts Field, I couldn’t help but think how unremarkable it probably looked to any uninitiated bystanders that might’ve been staring up from the ground. The plane isn’t particularly large; it doesn’t fly very fast; and it barely has enough space to hold two people. Hell, it can’t even get airborne without being towed by another plane because it isn’t equipped with a propulsion system of any sort. To the layman, it probably looked incredibly commonplace and boring — but when you learn that it’s somehow capable of flying to the edge of space without an engine, it suddenly becomes the most fascinating thing around.

After the the plane touched down and everyone swarmed the runway with cameras and microphones, I overheard the co-pilot say that it only reached a height of about 5,000 feet during the test — nowhere near the height it’ll attempt to reach next year in Argentina. Today’s flight was just the maiden voyage — the first of many test runs that’ll happen between now and 2016, when the Perlan team will attempt to dethrone the mighty SR-71 Blackbird and break the current altitude record for winged aircraft. In that mission, the team is shooting for 90,000 feet. For reference, most commercial airliners set their cruising altitude somewhere around 39,000 feet — and they’ve got jet engines to get them there.

Catch a wave and you’re sittin’ on top of the world

So how exactly do you get an engineless plane to the edge of space? To get an answer, I went straight to the world’s leading authority on the subject: Einar Enevoldson — the founder of the Perlan Project, veteran pilot, and one of the world’s leading authorities on stratospheric mountain waves — the massive air currents that Perlan 2 pilots intend to “surf”on to reach 90,000 feet.

Before could even open my mouth to ask the question, somebody behind me in the audience shouted out, “Can you very simply explain stratospheric mountain waves, for those of us who don’t know what they are?”

Ever seen a hawk or a seagull playing in an updraft? Flying a glider in a mountain wave is basically the same thing.

Basically, when strong winds cross over a mountain range and the atmosphere above them is stable, massive waves of air will form on the lee side of the mountain. The wind rushing down the back side of the mountain causes an atmospheric disturbance, and then a couple miles downwind there’s a rebound area, where the air is rising. With the right conditions and a skilled pilot, it’s possible to ride these updrafts high into the upper atmosphere. Ever seen a hawk or a seagull playing in an updraft? Flying a glider in a mountain wave is basically the same thing, just on a much larger scale.

“Unless you’ve flown in a wave, it’s hard to understand the energy that’s available in the atmosphere,” Perlan Project Chief Pilot Jim Payne told me. I’ve seen lift rates of 3,000 feet per minute on some waves — but of course when you see that much lift, there’s a corresponding area where it’s going down just as fast. You’ve got to be careful to avoid those areas, but it’s a phenomenon that’s just absolutely wonderful.”

Thing is, you can’t ride just any old mountain wave into the stratosphere. The common ones simply don’t go that high, and only reach into the middle of the troposphere — but over the past couple decades, the Perlan team has pinpointed where the really big ones happen. If you want to surf the world’s gnarliest mountain waves, you go to Argentina.

According to the Perlan team, Argentina’s low latitude and high mountain ranges make it an ideal location for stratospheric waves to form. The science is dizzyingly complicated, but all you really need to know is that a confluence of different atmospheric events take place over the country’s mountain ranges during the winter months, which together allow some mountain waves to propagate much higher into the atmosphere than they normally would.

Back in 2006, Perlan Project founder Einar Enevoldson and adventurer Steve Fosset proved that these waves can reach incredible heights by taking the Perlan 1 glider up to 50,722 feet — and they would’ve gone higher too, had their jumpsuits not inflated in the high altitude and made it difficult to fly the plane. That was the moment when they decided to build a glider with a pressurized cabin, and the Perlan 2 project was born.

For science; not just for the record books

If the Perlan 2 team achieves its goal and breaks 90,000 feet, it’ll secure its place in the record books. But mere record breaking isn’t the goal of the mission — there’s a much more noble purpose behind all this.

“There’s still wonderful adventures and discoveries to be made. The sky is not the limit. The sky is where we live.”

Figuring out this stuff is important, because many of our current climate models are very crude, and assume that there’s very little interaction between the troposphere (lowest layer of our atmosphere) and the stratosphere (the layer above it). So in order to build a more complete climate model and gain a better understanding of how humans are affecting climate change, we need better atmospheric data from the tropopause.

The thing is, gathering information from the turbulent parts of the atmosphere is tricky. Contrary to what you might assume, you couldn’t get the job done with a sensor studded weather balloon. “A balloon gets blown downwind,” co pilot Morgan explained. “It can’t hover in place; it can’t stay in one spot for two or thee hours; and it can’t take a perfectly vertical profile of a mountain wave. We think in this rising part of the wave is where most of the important processes are occurring related to ozone destruction, so we want to get lots of samples in that range.”

Drew Prindle/Digital Trends

Gathering new atmospheric data is the main goal here, but it’s really just the beginning. No aircraft has ever flown higher than 82,000 feet, so while the Perlan 2 is up there gathering atmospheric data, it’ll also provide us with valuable information on how winged aircraft behave in the upper atmosphere. When you’re up that high, the density of the atmosphere is considerably lower, so planes need to fly faster to generate enough lift, and their wings behave differently. Furthermore, in terms of density, the atmosphere up at 90,000 feet is extremely similar to the density of the Martian atmosphere, so any insights that the Perlan crew gains will be invaluable when it comes time to build aircraft that can fly on Mars.

“The important thing to remember is that not everything has been discovered,” Enevoldson told the audience. “There’s still wonderful adventures and discoveries to be made. Many of us tell us tell people that the ‘sky’s the limit’ — but the sky is not the limit. The sky is where we live.”"
Bombardier wants to sell a majority stake in its troubled CSeries jet to Airbus - Business Insider,"Tue, 06 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1leGNsdXNpdmUtYm9tYmFyZGllci1vZmZlcmVkLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWNzZXJpZXMtamV0LXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1zb3VyY2VzLTIwMTUtMTDSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ItZXhjbHVzaXZlLWJvbWJhcmRpZXItb2ZmZXJlZC1tYWpvcml0eS1zdGFrZS1pbi1jc2VyaWVzLWpldC10by1haXJidXMtc291cmNlcy0yMDE1LTEwP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier's CSeries aircraft lands after its first test flight in Mirabel, Quebec Thomson Reuters

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Bombardier has approached European planemaker Airbus about selling a majority stake in the Canadian company's CSeries jet in order to shore up its depleted balance sheet, people familiar with the matter said.

Under a proposed tie-up, Airbus would help Bombardier complete development of the troubled aircraft in exchange for a controlling stake in the program, effectively ending Bombardier’s independent efforts to break into the 100- to 160-seat airplane market dominated by Airbus and Boeing .

Significant hurdles would need to be cleared before Airbus took up the surprise offer to invest in its smaller competitor.

""There are ongoing discussions, but they are still exploratory ones. Neither management has made a decision,"" said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter, as did the other sources.

Another source called the contacts ""serious,"" but cautioned that it ""would be an extremely complicated structure to set up.""

If a deal is reached, Airbus would fund the final phase of development of the CSeries, an all-new, medium-haul, carbon-composite jet due to enter service next year, according to two sources. The deal would involve a minimal amount of cash up front, they said.

In return, Airbus would receive a controlling stake in the aircraft - which is years late and billions over budget - and a share in its revenue, although details are still being worked out.

The firms would probably form a separate board for the CSeries and sign a strategic agreement to jointly market the plane, if a deal was reached, sources said. Airbus and Bombardier declined comment. ""We have no comment on rumors about other companies, but we are always monitoring developments in our industry,"" Rainer Ohler, head of communications at Airbus Group, said.

Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau said the company would not “comment on rumors.”

Until recently, Bombardier had been reluctant to offer a majority stake in its main aircraft development program, but the company’s weakened balanced sheet has forced the Beaudoin family that controls the board to consider all options, said one source, who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Bombardier haunted by decision to enter the commercial jet market - Business Insider,"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9tYmFyZGllci1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy13cml0ZS1kb3duLTIwMTUtMTDSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2JvbWJhcmRpZXItY2hhbGxlbmdlLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctd3JpdGUtZG93bi0yMDE1LTEwP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier was ""overwhelmed"" by its development programs, the company's CEO said after the jet and train maker announced a massive write-down.



The company is taking a $4.4 billion charge, mostly related to its larger C-Series jet, which is meant to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 in the medium-range airliner market.



That jet, which Bombardier decided it would build in 2004, has been beset by cost overruns and delays. More than a decade after it was conceived, the aircraft still isn't in commercial service.

Bombardier

The company reported a loss of $4.9 billion for the quarter. The write-down includes a $1.2 billion charge for the Lear85 project, which the company has canceled. Bombardier also confirmed reports that the Quebec government would inject $1 billion into the C-Series program.

The company's shares fell 15% after the results, adding to a decline that has already wiped away two-thirds of Bombardier's market value this year. During the third-quarter earnings call, one analyst asked just how the company got to this point financially.

""It's not as bad as people think,"" Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare said. ""We had multiple development programs running concurrently, and that was challenging for the company. The company was overwhelmed.""

The CEO added that most of those programs were complete, near completion, or canceled.



Ratings agencies have been worried about the C-Series drain on Bombardier's cash.

""Bombardier needs to the get the plane into service, prove that it is successful, and generate more demand if it wants to correct its cash flow shortage,"" Moody's analyst Darren Kirk said before Thursday's results.

Bombardier said on Thursday that the C-Series program was expected to be cash-flow positive around 2020 — but would require an additional $2 billion to get there.

Not fast enough

With the jet scheduled to enter service next year, the company has 243 firm orders on the books.

The concern, however, is that those orders aren't coming fast enough. A whole year has come and gone since Bombardier last announced a new buyer for the C-Series, and one of its largest buyers so far, Republic Airways, could be about to bolt.

Republic, which originally ordered the plane for its now sold Frontier subsidiary, has said it is considering backing off from its commitment to the aircraft amid a slowdown in its own business.



""The Republic Airways planes are never going to be delivered to Republic,"" Airways News senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara said in an interview ahead of the results.

Related stories

In June, Bombardier flew both the CS100 and the larger CS300 to the Paris Air Show. The planes arrived at Le Bourget airport with great fanfare but left without booking a single new order.

The painful thing for Bombardier is that there's nothing wrong with the airplane. In fact, the C-Series has garnered generally positive reviews.

""The CS300 kills the Boeing 737 Max 7 and the Airbus A319neo in terms of ability and efficiency,"" Bhaskara said.

At the Paris Air Show, the aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation's president and CEO, John Plueger, told The Seattle Times that it was not enough for people to like the plane — Bombardier needed orders.

It's a stark contrast to Bombardier's other aircraft. The company's CRJ-Series regional jets are among the most in-demand aircraft of their type, with nearly 2,000 examples in service. Its Q-Series turboprop airliner is a staple of regional airlines around the world, with more than 1,000 of the planes in service. That's on top of the company's iconic Challenger, Global, and Learjet families of private jets.

Part of the problem is that the C-Series is tapping a part of the market that the world's largest aircraft makers have deemed unworthy because of thin profits. Boeing and Airbus discontinued their regional jets, the 737-600 and A318.

All may not be lost.

Analysts such as Bhaskara predict room for as many as 2,500 planes in the 100- to 150-seat jet category, and Bloomberg recently reported that Bombardier was in talks about a possible order with JetBlue Airways.

Another major buyer, according to Bloomberg, could be United Airlines, which told pilots it planned to order small jetliners, Bloomberg also reports.

There's also room for the C-Series to recover as the older Boeing and Airbus aircraft are phased out and need to be replaced, said Tom Capital, Deloitte's vice chairman and head of global aerospace and defense.

""Boeing and Airbus are focusing on larger aircraft with longer range,"" Captain said. ""This has left an opening for others such as Bombardier to come in with new and efficient equipment.""

The trick for Bombardier now is to turn that optimism into actual orders. And fast."

Singapore Airlines says it plans to resume nonstop flights between Singapore and the United States in 2018, possibly retaking the title for the world's longest flight.

The carrier says it will resume the routes after taking delivery of a new ""ultra long-range variant"" of the Airbus A350. Singapore Air will be the launch customer for that version of the A350-900, which Airbus confirmed Tuesday.

""Our customers have been asking us to re-start non-stop Singapore-U.S. flights and we are pleased that Airbus was able to offer the right aircraft to do so in a commercially viable manner,"" Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong says in a statement.

Once it has its ""A350-900ULRs,"" Singapore Air plans to fly from Singapore to both New York and Los Angeles. ""Additional points in the U.S. are also under consideration,"" the airline says. The new A350s ""will be fitted with all-new cabin products which are currently under development.""

Singapore Air says the A350-900ULR will allow it to profitably resume nonstop routes between Singapore and the U.S. The airline dropped its Singapore-U.S. nonstops in 2013 after retiring the Airbus A340-500s it had used for the ultra-long flights.

Singapore still flies from four U.S. airports — New York JFK, Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco — though the airline's schedule in those cities includes flights that first stop in Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Frankfurt or Moscow on their way to Singapore.

The return of Singapore-U.S. routes on the A350 would position Singapore Air to retake the title for having the world's longest airline route, which it had been able to claim until it ended its U.S.-Singapore nonstops.

As for the new A350-900ULR, Airbus says the aircraft ""incorporates a number of necessary changes over the standard A350-900. These include a higher capacity fuel system within the existing fuel tanks, increasing fuel carrying capacity from 141,000 litres to 165,000 liters.""

With its updated A350 order from Airbus, Singapore Airlines now has firm orders for 67 A350-900s, seven of which are now for the new A350-900ULR variant.

""We are excited to be working with Singapore Airlines to re-launch its premium non-stop service to the U.S.,"" Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier says in a statement. ""The A350 is the perfect, flexible platform for such operations, offering unrivaled operating economics for the very longest routes. And the wider and quieter cabin will provide the perfect environment for passengers to enjoy the world-famous Singapore Airlines in-flight product.""

Airbus Helicopters Inc. will feature the newest, most innovative and highly capable single-engine helicopter for air medical transport services when AMTC 2015 opens Monday in Long Beach.

The leading provider of air medical transport service helicopters in the U.S. market, Airbus Helicopters Inc. (Booth 727) will exhibit two leading helicopter models. The featured aircraft is the single-engine H130, a highly efficient, next-generation aircraft equipped with an innovative air medical transport equipment package designed and installed by United Rotorcraft. The air medical-equipped H130 (formerly EC130 T2) has recently begun a Western U.S. demonstration tour.

Also on display will be an H135-series twin-engine air medical helicopter, the predecessor to the newly certified H135 now being offered in the U.S. and global markets.

“Airbus Helicopters offers the most capable, mission-fit and cost efficient helicopters on the market for air medical transport service providers,” said Jennifer Hardcastle, air medical sales manager for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “Our single-engine H130 and H125 models offer high performance, low cost, and versatility. The twin-engine H135 and H145 models provide large interior cabins for equipment, medical crew, and patients, combined with industry-leading payloads and hot-and-high performance.”

The H130 on display at AMTC will be an Airbus Helicopters Inc. demonstrator. The first H130 equipped with United Rotorcraft’s air medical interior equipment package went into service in February with the Enloe Medical Center FlightCare program in Chico, Calif. Eight more H130s with the same equipment package have been delivered recently to Air Methods Corp.

Members of the Enloe FlightCare team, who are enthusiastic about the performance and air medical equipment of the H130, will be on hand at AMTC to demonstrate the aircraft’s capabilities.

“We reviewed our options for new aircraft and at decision time it became very clear the H130 offered a lot of advantages,” said Marty Marshall, program director for Enloe FlightCare. “It performs very well in our operating environment here where we’re surrounded by high mountains in the Sierras and operate in high-density altitude in the valley during the heat of summer.”

The H130’s large cabin size and the United Rotorcraft equipment package are advantageous to provide care for patients, Marshall said. “I can’t think of one thing I would change in this aircraft. It has exceeded our expectations.”

The Airbus Helicopters Inc. booth will also feature an H135-series (formerly EC135) twin-engine helicopter owned and operated by California Shock Trauma and Rescue (CALSTAR), of Sacramento, Calif. CALSTAR operates eight of these aircraft in its operations throughout much of Central and Northern California.

The Airbus Helicopters H135, the latest version of this family of helicopters, offers increased power and payload for high-and-hot operations. More than 1,200 versions of the H135/EC135 family are in operation globally and have accumulated a total of more than three million flight hours. The model is a worldwide favorite of air medical transport services.

As part of its ongoing commitment to improving air medical transport safety, Airbus Helicopters Inc. will award prizes for education and training to qualified air medical industry employees during AMTC. The awards will include two $2,000 grants for AAMS Safety Management Training Academy tuition.

In addition, free training programs at Airbus Helicopters Inc.’s facility in Grand Prairie, Texas will be given away during AMTC, including two IIMC (Inadvertent Instrument Meteorological Conditions) courses. Another recipient will receive their choice of either a pilot refresher training course on a simulator platform of their choice (H125, H135 or H145) or a field maintenance course. For details on how to enter for these prizes visit the Airbus Helicopters Inc. booth.

The Dallas/Fort Worth to Sydney service flown by Qantas is currently the world’s longest commercial passenger route, with an Airbus A380-842 covering the 13,805 km (8,578 mi) distance in just under 17 hours. But in August Emirates announced plans to beat this with non-stop flights between Dubai and Panama City to begin in February next year. Emirates will use Boeing 777-200LR aircraft on the route, which is 13,821 km (8,588 mi) long and will take 17 hours 35 minutes for the westbound trip.

But Emirates may not hold the world’s longest commercial passenger route title for long, with Singapore Airlines set to recommence non-stop flights between Singapore and both Los Angeles and New York in 2018. The airline previously operated these routes (technically Newark, NJ rather than New York) until 2013, when the A340-500s that flew it were retired.

The newly launched A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range) variant, boasting a range of up to 8,700 nm (10,012 mi/16,112 km), will allow the airline to re-launch these routes and claim the longest route title from Emirates with the over 15,300-km (9,500-mi) trip to take around 19 hours.

The A350-900ULR can go the distance thanks to a number of changes not found on the standard long-haul specification A350-900. These include a modified fuel system that increases the aircraft’s fuel carrying capacity from 141,000 liters to 165,000 liters, aerodynamic improvements and an increase in maximum take-off weight (MTOW) to 280 tonnes (309 tons).

Seven of the 63 A350-900s Singapore Airlines has ordered will be upgraded to A350-900ULR variants, with the airline set to take delivery of its first A350-900 in early 2016, with deliveries of the A350-900ULR aircraft to follow in 2018.

Airbus Helicopters introduces H145 Mercedes-Benz Style - Pilot - Pilot Magazine,"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHA6Ly9waWxvdHdlYi5hZXJvL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtaDE0NS1tZXJjZWRlcy1iZW56LXN0eWxlLTYyNTU3NDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Attention super yacht owners: Airbus has redesigned the cabin interior of the old EC145 with in-flight connectivity and increased, automotive-themed comfort – and four orders have been placed already, with first deliveries starting in Q4 2015

The new ‘Mercedes-Benz Style’ VIP version on the H145 offers higher performance, increased flight safety and improved exterior design over the former EC145 from which the new model was developed. Airbus Helicopters has received four orders for the H145 Mercedes -Benz Style so far. Deliveries are to start before the end of the year.

The aircraft is tailored for high-end private and corporate operations. It offers a ‘versatile and stylish’ cabin that has been upgraded to fulfil the highest expectations in terms of refinement, comfort and quality. “Inspired by the top-of-the-range vehicles of the brand with the star, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers a redesigned cabin interior that includes in -flight Wi-Fi connectivity, an improved infotainment system and new seat design for increased ergonomic comfort ” said Frederic Lemos, Airbus Helicopters’ Head of Private & Business Aviation Europe. “Customers wishing to further personalise their aircraft will be able to work directly with Airbus Helicopters and the creative design teams at Mercedes-Benz Style to define their unique cabin environment”.

The aircraft is proposed in three different ‘harmonies’ that customers can combine with a real wooden floor or a choice of sophisticated carpets. The interior liners and the new light concept also contribute to the elegant and welcoming interior atmosphere. Multi -purpose storage is made possible by numerous attachment points on the floor and walls and a new and perfectly integrated cabinet, offering increased storage volume.

With its unrivalled modular interior, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers extreme cabin arrangement flexibility for a broad range of travels: executive transportation, exploration tourism, family voyages, as well as leisure and sport trips. All seats , galley and walls are mounted on rails and can be easily reconfigured from four to eight passengers – or removed to transport more luggage or large items. The aircraft is extremely compact making it also the ideal choice for super yacht owners, says Airbus Helicopters.

Singapore Airlines launches the A350-900 ULR... but will it work? - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC8xNC9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtdGhlLWEzNTAtOTAwLXVsci1idXQtd2lsbC1pdC13b3JrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines seemingly wants its non stop services between Singapore and the USA back. So much so – it has gone to Airbus for a variant of the Airbus A350-900 – dubbed the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range).



Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900 ULR – Rendering, Airbus.

From the pool of orders Singapore Airline has with Airbus for the A350-900, seven of them will be the ULR variant.

According to Leeman News, these will have 170 seats installed on the plane to be operated in a premium configuration.

Plans exist to operate them in 2018 between Singapore and Los Angeles and Singapore and New York.

Even Singapore Airlines have got the PR out already:

Singapore Airlines holds orders for 67 A350s in total.

I’m going to admit – this is a tough call to make it work. Last time Singapore did this – again – they used special mission aircraft (Airbus A340-500s), which had the fuel tanks and legs for this segment.

Part of the reason why this flight is premium is that for a lot of the flight – the plane is a flying fuel tanker. When fuel prices hit the roof a few years ago, the route just wasn’t economical to run.

It seems that Singapore Airlines thinks the tide has turned, and it can run the route again.

Whist these segments are long (and 19 hours is long by any stretch of the imagination), it will take some creative work to ensure those planes both make the loads and yields to make this route work again.

And I’m unsure if these actually exist.

The A350-900ULR will add a new dimension to the fuel costs, and hopefully deliver the savings Singapore Airlines require.

If its enough will be the big question.

Squeezed into a big metal tube, shoulder to shoulder with a stranger, flying isn't most people's cup of tea.

But airplane manufacturers are always trying to make things better and are constantly creating patents for potential new innovations.

Airbus for example, one of the biggest aerospace companies, recently told the Daily Mail that it files more than 600 patents per year.

STAT MedEvac, a major air medical transport service provider, has ordered two H135-series (formerly EC135) helicopters from Airbus Helicopters Inc. to replace older aircraft. The announcement was made Tuesday at the Air Medical Transport Conference in Long Beach, Calif.

STAT MedEvac provides air medical transport services to residents of much of western Pennsylvania and operates some 10,000 missions a year with a fleet of 20 helicopters, including 14 EC135s and six EC145s. The new helicopters ordered will be used to replace older aircraft.

“We’re very pleased that the STAT MedEvac leadership has shown its continued trust and confidence in Airbus Helicopters products and service,” said Treg Manning, vice president of sales and marketing for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “It is gratifying for all of us at Airbus Helicopters Inc. that we have earned the loyalty of STAT MedEvac, an air medical operator with an outstanding reputation for safety and high quality.”

“As we upgrade our helicopters, we always thoroughly evaluate the aircraft available,” said Doug Garretson, president and chief executive officer of STAT MedEvac. “We chose the EC135s and the EC145s from Airbus Helicopters. It comes down to product performance and support. They currently are the best products for our missions and the team at Airbus Helicopters Inc. works with us to help ensure that our aircraft are available to meet the needs of our crews and our customers.”

“We have standardized on the EC135 and EC145 platforms because they are the products that best meet our needs and because of the additional efficiencies we have been able to establish,” said Garretson. “Using a common helicopter platform allows us to effectively manage our fleet’s maintenance program. We are also able to cross-train all of our pilots on both aircraft, which helps ensure maximum flexibility in scheduling and personnel availability.”

STAT MedEvac was the first helicopter and HEMS FAA Part 135 air carrier accepted into the FAA’s Aviation Safety Action Program. STAT’s fleet operates from 17 bases in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. These regional bases link rural and community health resources with advanced tertiary care centers and provide quick access to advanced care. STAT MedEvac is a service of the not-for-profit Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania, Inc.

More than 1,200 versions of the H135/EC135 family are in operation globally and have accumulated a total of more than three million flight hours. The model is a worldwide favorite of air medical transport services. Earlier versions can be fully retrofitted to bring them up to the technical level of the H135, the newest model in the family.

Airbus Group Australia Pacific Photo

Nautilus Aviation soars to new heights with Airbus Helicopters, welcoming its second new aircraft in 14 months.

The versatility of Airbus Helicopters’ multi-mission workhorse, the H125 (formerly AS350 B3e), will be put to the test as the latest member of Nautilus Aviation’s expanding fleet in North Queensland.

The company plans to use the versatile Squirrel for everything from luxury charters to popular helicopter tourism experiences like heli fishing and adrenaline tours, through to heavy-duty aerial work, ranging from surveys and sling operations to search and rescue, firefighting, mining support and emergency services.

“Nautilus Aviation looks forward to the arrival of its latest acquisition, the H125,” said Tony West, senior base pilot at Nautilus Aviation. “The H125 brings unrivalled performance and capabilities to our fleet in our region.

“We’ve already been receiving enquiries from our long term clients and new clients who are keen to utilize the H125 for their upcoming projects as our operations expand across Australia.”

Since its beginning in 1988, the company has expanded to operate out of Cairns, Townsville, Horn Island and Weipa. Its acquisition of an H125 comes just 14 months after it purchased an EC130 T2. It also operates three Airbus Helicopters EC120s and one EC130 B4.

For the high passage of tourists to North Queensland, the fleet of helicopters offers optimal aerial viewing platforms of some of the Earth’s natural wonders, including the Great Barrier Reef, Daintree Rainforest and island idylls that are otherwise difficult to reach.

Commenting on the Oct. 1 delivery, Cedric Bessette, director civil helicopters, Airbus Group Australia Pacific, said the H125 was a perfect fit for Nautilus Aviation and its increasingly diverse operational requirements.

Renowned for excelling in extreme conditions – notably including North Queensland’s hot and humid tropical climate – the H125 single-engine helicopter offers exceptional performance, agility, safety, low maintenance and low acquisition costs.

In 2005, its predecessor, the AS350 B3, broke the world record for the highest-altitude landing and take-off, performed on Mount Everest at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet).

“The H125 and other aircraft in Airbus Helicopters’ Squirrel (Écureuil) family are among our most popular,” Bessette said.

“To date, in excess of 5,000 have been delivered in more than 100 countries for some 1,600 operators – in total, clocking up more than 23 million flight hours.

“And, for Australian customers, who face some of the world’s most extreme conditions, they are the perfect fit, without losing any of our signature comfort and class.”

The H125 boasts a wide, spacious, air-conditioned cabin that is easily accessed through two large sliding doors, promising low vibration levels for maximum passenger comfort.

Further, its high cruising speed, range and payload means it can carry more passengers on more roundtrip flights per day than any other helicopter in its class and, due to its versatile flat floor, can be quickly and easily reconfigured for all types of roles.

The H125 is equipped with a Turbomeca Arriel 2D turboshaft engine, including an upgraded triple engine control thanks to a dual-channel FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) unit, plus a third independent and automatic back-up channel for automatic start-up."

The plane maker is using more of the metal due to its strength and light weight. “With this technology of 3D printing or added layer manufacturing titanium is a very interesting candidate… We are working on qualifying titanium for application in aerospace… We’ve started changing simple parts on some aircraft for 3D-printed titanium parts and I think this will go to much bigger and complicated parts…This is where we can collaborate,” said Flaig, speaking at the Open Innovations Forum in Russia. Russia is one of the world’s biggest titanium producers, and has some of the best knowhow in working with the metal. Titanium is extremely difficult to work with in manufacturing. “We have production orders for nearly nine years–a record in any industry. Our challenge is to wrap up production to fulfill the needs. If there’s a small volatility, we can manage it,” Flaig said."

All 224 passengers and crew on board a Russian passenger plane that crashed in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula have died, Egyptian medical and security sources said.

Search and rescue team members are still gathering the remains of victims after the crash on Saturday, the sources said.

The plane was heading to St Petersburg, likely carrying tourists returning from holidays in Egypt’s popular Sharm el-Sheikh resort.

The Russian embassy confirmed there were no survivors.

In a statement, Egypt’s civil aviation ministry said the wreckage of the Russian passenger jet was found in the Hassana area, south of the city of el-Arish.

It said the plane – a Metrojet Airbus A321 – took off from the Sinai Peninsula’s Sharm el-Sheikh, a popular destination for Russian tourists, and disappeared from radar screens 23 minutes after takeoff.

Germany’s Lufthansa and Air France said they would halt flights over Sinai until the reasons behind the crash became clear.

Day of mourning

Among the passengers were 214 Russians and three Ukrainians, plus seven crew members, the Egyptian government said.

At least 24 children were on board, the Association of Travel Operators of Russia said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a day of national mourning.

Many bodies had already been found, said Mahmoud al-Zanati, head of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority.

“The search operation is still going on at the site of the accident. The wreckage is spread across a vast area,” he added, according to state-run newspaper, al-Ahram.

‘A tragic scene’

Egyptian rescue team members earlier said they heard voices in a section of the plane, an officer on the scene told Reuters news agency.

North Sinai security sources said a technical fault caused the crash.

The flight recorder which contains the flight data was also found at the scene.

An Egyptian security officer at the scene said: “A lot of the dead are on the ground, and many died whilst strapped to their seats. I now see a tragic scene.

“The plane split into two, a small part on the tail end that burned and a larger part that crashed into a rock. We have extracted at least 100 bodies, and the rest are still inside.”

At a hotel near St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport, the friends and relatives of those on the flight gathered to grieve.

Yulia Zaitseva said her friends, a newlywed couple named Elena Rodina and Alexqander Krotov, were on the flight. Both were 33 years old.

Zaitseva said that her friend “really wanted to go to Egypt”.

She added: “We were friends for 20 years. She was a very good friend who was ready to give everything to other people. To lose such a friend is like having your hand cut off.”

Investigation launched

Separately, Egypt’s top prosecutor ordered an investigation into the cause of the crash.

Nabil Sadek, the prosecutor general, ordered the formation of a team of prosecutors tasked with going to the site of the crash and investigating the debris.

A centre to help relatives of the passengers has been set up at the Pulkovo airport, Tass news agency quoted St Petersburg city officials as saying.

The Airbus A321 was at an altitude of 9,450m when it vanished from radar screens.

Most of the passengers are said to be Russian tourists, according to reports. The plane was operated by the small Russian airline Kogalymavia, based in western Siberia.

Technical malfunction



The pilot reportedly requested clearance for an emergency landing at Cairo airport due to a technical malfunction.

A senior Egyptian air traffic control official said the pilot told him in their last communication that he had radio trouble.

Russian aviation official Sergei Izvolsky told Interfax news agency the aircraft took off from Sharm el-Sheikh at 5:51am (03:51 GMT).

He said it did not make contact as expected with Cyprus air traffic control.

“Communication was lost today with the Airbus A321 of Kogalymavia, which was carrying out flight 9268 from Sharm el-Sheikh to Saint Petersburg,” Izvolsky told Russian television networks.

“The plane departed Sharm el-Sheikh with 217 passengers and seven crew members. At 7:14am Moscow time, the crew was scheduled to make contact with … Larnaca [Cyprus].

“However, this did not happen and the plane disappeared from the radar screens.”"

Under the deal, Waypoint will mainly lease the H135s to operators involved in emergency medical services (EMS) missions worldwide.

The H135 helicopters have a flexible configuration and are capable of performing multi-roles. They are also able perform other public services such as law enforcement, rescue, and offshore operations.

Waypoint is the first lessor to purchase and lease an Airbus H135. Presently, it has 25 Airbus aircraft in its global fleet.

Waypoint Leasing CEO Ed Washecka said: ""We are pleased to be the pioneer acquirer of the H135, as we continue to offer operators state-of-the-art helicopters for EMS missions and other critical operations.



""The H135 complements our current Airbus offerings, which include the H225 and H145, and adds scale and diversity to our fleet.""

""They were the first lessor to acquire the H145 and now the first to order the H135, two aircraft that will bolster their success in fast-growing market segments.""

With the agreement, Waypoint and Airbus are expecting to expand their position in the helicopter market and its lease solutions sectors.

Airbus Helicopter global business and services executive vice-president Dominique Maudet said: ""This signature represents a significant step in the development of our partnership with Waypoint, and we continue to work together to support their objectives.

""They were the first lessor to acquire the H145 and now the first to order the H135, two aircraft that will bolster their success in fast-growing market segments.""

H135 is a multi-purpose aircraft that can be used in several missions such as EMS or police tasks, even in difficult weather conditions and terrains.

In a separate transaction, Waypoint stated that it has placed the first of its Airbus H145 orders on lease with Pacific Helicopters, a firm that provides helicopter services in Papua New Guinea and across the Asia Pacific region.

SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines will resume non-stop flights to the United States in 2018 after becoming the launch customer for a new ultra-long distance variant of the Airbus A350, the carrier said in a statement.SIA converted seven of the 63 A350-900s in its order book to the A350-900ULR variant for the services. It has also converted four purchase options for the A350 into firm orders, giving it a backlog of 67 of the latest widebody jet on the market.Resuming non-stop US flights, popular with business travelers, will be an important landmark for SIA, which operated all-business class Airbus A340-500s to the United States until it retired the planes in 2013.While the four-engined A340s were the only planes with the range for the service, the high cost of operating them at a time when oil prices were more than double current levels made it hard to turn a profit on those flights.It will start with services to Los Angeles and New York. The New York service, at around 19 hours, will be the longest in the world when it begins.SIA has recently found it harder to make money on services between Singapore and Europe amid tepid economic growth in the continent and tough competition, leaving it dependent on intra-Asian traffic to a greater degree than its executives would have preferred, say sources familiar with the airline's thinking.""Our customers have been asking us to re-start non-stop Singapore-US flights and we are pleased that Airbus was able to offer the right aircraft to do so in a commercially viable manner,"" said Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong in a statement.SIA's only services to the United Sates go via other hubs. The airline flies to Houston via Moscow, San Francisco via Seoul and Hong Kong, and Los Angeles via Narita.Airbus said the new A350 variant will include a modified fuel system to increase fuel-carrying capacity, and an increase in the maximum take-off weight."
Bond Air Services to deliver U.K.'s first H135 to Thames Valley Air Ambulance - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 09 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JvbmRhaXJzZXJ2aWNlc3RvZGVsaXZlcnVrc2ZpcnN0aDEzNXRvdGhhbWVzdmFsbGV5YWlyYW1idWxhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new H135 will replace Thames Valley Air Ambulance’s current EC135 T2. Bond Air Services/Airbus Helicopters Photo

The first H135 in the U.K., acquired and operated by Bond Air Services on behalf of Thames Valley Air Ambulance, is imminently entering into service in the Thames Valley region. The public launch of the aircraft, to take place in Oxfordshire on Monday Oct. 12, will see the start of the H135’s first operations in the U.K., in emergency medical services (EMS) role.

Initially delivered to Bond Air Services in August 2015 for the fitting of an Aerolite EMS interior and completion, the H135 will replace Thames Valley Air Ambulance’s current EC135 T2, in service since 2008. Replacing this aircraft with an H135 is a testament to Thames Valley Air Ambulance’s satisfaction and confidence in the performance and capability of this family of aircraft.

Mark McGeown, CEO Thames Valley Air Ambulance said, “We are looking forward to bringing it into service as our next generation EMS aircraft. The improved performance, increased payload and better fuel economy of the Airbus H135, combined with NVIS capabilities, will enable our crews to take the major step into night HEMS operations. This is key to the future development of our air ambulance service”

The commitment to the new helicopter, a decision not lightly made by a charity, comes as a result of the additional capabilities the H135 brings, including night flights, advanced avionics, further reduced noise footprint and increased payload. Furthermore, the light maintenance requirements, coupled with high reliability ensure the H135 has the lowest direct operating costs in its class.

Colin James, U.K. managing director Airbus Helicopters, said “The H135 is the latest evolution of Airbus Helicopters’ most successful light, twin-engine helicopter. It has been the backbone of British police and EMS operations for the last decade and the H135 provides the improved capability for it to continue in this role for the decade to come.”"

By Jun Ji-hye



The Airbus A400M military transport plane will be displayed at a defense exhibition in Korea next week.



Visitors can see the cutting-edge aircraft during the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition 2015 (Seoul ADEX 2015) that will run for six days from Oct. 20 at Seoul Airport in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.



An official of Airbus Defense and Space said Friday that air forces of eight countries have placed orders for 174 A400Ms, and 14 of the aircraft are operating.



The French Air Force received the Airbus military transport first in August 2013.



""The A400M is famous for its performance, regardless of high and low altitude during its missions,"" a company official said.



The exhibition, which began in 1996, includes indoor exhibits, demonstration flights and an outdoor exhibition of aircraft and ground equipment.



In June, Airbus beat its U.S. rival Boeing to win a 1.4 trillion won ($1.3 billion) deal to provide four in-flight refueling tankers by 2019 to the South Korea Air Force."

By Choi Kyong-ae

Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) said Monday it had signed an initial agreement with Airbus to deliver more aircraft parts worth 1 trillion won ($885 million) to the European airplane maker.

""Under a memorandum of understanding, we are taking part in Airbus' development project of a mid-size plane. Our participation in the project means KAI is qualified to produce parts for it in new orders,"" a KAI official said.

The official didn't elaborate on the timeframe for new orders.

KAI, Korea's sole aircraft manufacturer, has provided parts for airplanes manufactured not only by Airbus but also by Boeing over the past decades.

On top of this, KAI has maintained business partnerships in the fields of maintenance, repair and operation (MRO), helicopter and satellite manufacturing, the company said in a statement.

""In the helicopter business, KAI will join hands with Airbus in marketing activities for the multipurpose Surion helicopter,"" the official said.

The Surion, jointly developed with Airbus, is a multipurpose Korean-made helicopter which can carry nine people during combat and travel at a speed of 162 mph for at least two hours.

In the aerospace business, KAI is expected to gain support from Airbus to push forward its aerospace and satellite projects, according to the statement.

In an extended effort to cement business ties with Airbus, KAI belongs to the joint development team for the next-generation A350 XWB passenger jet. It is a supplier of lower wing parts and other core sections of all airplanes produced by Airbus such as the A320.

Moreover, KAI is seeking help from Airbus in developing the light attack helicopter and the light civil helicopter and joint marketing for the helicopters, the official said.

For the whole of this year, KAI expects exports of airplane parts to reach 910 billion won mainly to Airbus and Boeing, up 21 percent from 750 billion won a year earlier, the statement said.

By 2020, KAI aims to more than double the figure to 2 trillion won."

[Photo/Agencies]

Finnair Oyj plans to use the latest generation of Airbus 350 XWB aircraft on its routes to China from next month, a top company official said.

The carrier, which received its first Airbus 350 XWB on Wednesday, will use the aircraft on its Helsinki-Shanghai route from Nov 21, after flying on some short-haul routes inside Europe, according to Pekka Vauramo, CEO of Finnair.

Shanghai has a strong demand for cargo, said Vauramo, and that is why the carrier chose Shanghai to be the first long-haul destination for the A350 XWB.

Beijing is also on Finnair's Airbus 350 XWB list, although the exact time frame has not been finalized, Vauramo said.

""We expect the market in China to be the strongest than ever before in the summer season,"" he said. ""We also look forward to sustained growth in our key market, which is the Europe-Asia market.""

Meanwhile, the carrier said it was adding Guangzhou as its sixth Chinese destination from 2016 with four weekly flights in the summer season between May 6 and Oct 29.

""We intend to double our Asian traffic by 2020 from the 2010 baseline and the new destination is important for this target,"" Vauramo said.

The carrier will use A330 aircraft on the new route, as it will only receive four of its 19 A350 XWB orders this year.

The balance orders are set to be completed in the next eight years, said Fabrice Bregier, president and CEO of Airbus SAS.

Finnair's A350 XWB has 297 seats with three cabins, including 46 in business class, 43 in economy comfort and 208 in economy class.

""A350 is the perfect aircraft to spearhead Finnair's Asian expansion,"" said Bregier, as it is the first carrier operating the nonstop route from the Europe to China since 1988."

Pilar Albiac, executive vice president of operations Defense & Space Airbus, the subsidiary that groups all Airbus military affairs, told the staff St. Paul in a speech that Egypt has asked the company to have the A400M multi-national four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft as soon as possible.

Has not disclosed the number of units that the African country has requested, but what matters is that would be the first state seeking to buy these aircraft since the program was launched by the customer nations (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Luxembourg, Turkey, Belgium and Malaysia, which joined in 2005). And even more relevant because last May 9 one of the planes that was by testing before delivery to the Turkish army fell shortly after takeoff in Seville. The accident is therefore not taking effect on the export potential of the device.

Egypt is the first customer of another Airbus military aircraft that is assembled in Seville, the C295, which runs 24 aircraft, the largest fleet in the world individually. Albiac told the staff that the response of the Egyptian army Airbus has been that it must meet its commitments to the countries and customers, but that Egypt welcomes aware of the importance of the A400M aircraft to keep it safe.

Airbus already had an order of 8 aircraft from South Africa that eventually was canceled, and another 3 to Chile is to be realized after being frozen by the change of government in recent years.

Albiac also encouraged the workers and management of San Pablo to make the effort required to deliver 10 aircraft A400M in the remainder of 2015 have been delivered five aircraft (the last one week ago) so far this year, bringing the goal of providing customers between 13 and 17 appliances in this exercise would be fulfilled.

The Airbus A400M is a multi-national four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. It was designed by Airbus Military (merged in January 2014 to Airbus Defence and Space) as a tactical airlifter withstrategic capabilities to replace older transport aircraft, such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. As well as transport, the A400M can perform electronic surveillance and aerial refuelling."

An Airbus design for a successor to Concorde will fly at 4.5 times the speed of sound and get passengers from London to New York in one hour flat.

The Concorde 2 would take off vertically and fly at speeds of 3,425 miles per hour – three times faster than the original Concorde, according to a video by Patent Yogi.

Described as “the highest rollercoaster in the world”, the aircraft would rely on three different types of engine, each fuelled by different forms of hydrogen.

Two turbo jets would propel the plane into the air in a vertical take-off. A rocket motor would then accelerate it through the sound barrier, taking it to 35,000m altitude. Finally wing-mounted ramjets would push the Concorde 2 to its final cruising speed of Mach 4.5.

The designs, based on a patent awarded to Airbus in July, are of a sleek, futuristic aircraft that look more at home in a Hollywood sci-fi than over the skies of London.

Boeing annouces it has made the lightest metal ever

But the smooth bubble-shaped outline will also make the aircraft quieter, cutting down the volume of the infamous sonic boom as the plane breaches the sound barrier.

The hypersonic jet might not not only cut down trans-Atlantic journey times - it could also potentially cross the Pacific from LA to Tokyo in just three hours.

However not all its specifications improve on the original Concorde. It will only carry 20 passengers – sitting in hammocks according to the video - and the cost of a ticket could burn a hole in your pocket.

“In the case of civil applications, the market envisaged is principally that of business travel and VIP passengers, who require transcontinental return journeys within one day,” the patent states, according to the Daily Mail.

Airbus says the jet could also be used for military purposes, transporting soldiers at high speed, creating the ultimate rapid-reaction force."
Norwegian Air Ambulance becomes launch customer for the newly improved H135 - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 06 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL25vcndlZ2lhbmFpcmFtYnVsYW5jZWJlY29tZXNsYXVuY2hjdXN0b21lcmZvcnRoZW5ld2x5aW1wcm92ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first delivery of the technically improved H135 is planned for 2017. Airbus Helicopters Image

The Norwegian Air Ambulance (Norsk Luftambulanse AS) will be the first operator to purchase the technically improved H135. Three units have been ordered with the option for further helicopters in the future. The first delivery is planned for 2017.

The Norwegian emergency medical services (EMS) operator will benefit from Airbus Helicopters’ enhancements to the versatile H135, which began with engine improvements offering increased performance for CAT A flights from elevated heliports and in hot and high situations. The latest improvements announced at Helitech include a modern 4-axis autopilot, stabilizing the rotorcraft in every instant of the flight; a redesigned aft cabin roof offering increased space; and the addition of the Airbus Helicopters-designed Helionix avionics suite, the safest and most efficient solution in operation.

“With this additional step of evolving the helicopter’s avionic system on top of the increase in performance we’ve already achieved, we’re reinforcing the rotorcraft’s unique features such as unbeatable performance, efficiency and safety,” said Axel Humpert, head of the H135 program at Airbus Helicopters. “The improved situational awareness of the pilots and the even bigger cabin flexibility will ensure the role of the H135 as the reference helicopter for EMS missions on the world market.”

Helionix significantly supports the pilot during the mission by intelligently providing the right information at the right time to reduce pilot workload. It not only presents the flight parameters in the most intuitive way and in a single view for optimized flight management, but also offers customers a training and fleet commonality, with identical avionics architecture also on the H145, H175 and H160.

Norsk Luftambulanse – an experienced operator performing more than 8000 air rescue missions annually in Norway and Denmark, has flown machines of the H135-family for many years. They currently operate 13 units of the EC135 P2+, one EC145 C2 and two units of the H145, which are deployed in the challenging environment of the Norwegian mountains and also in Denmark.

“With its latest evolution, the H135 perfectly responds to our growing demands as far as performance, availability and safety are concerned,” commented Lars Kobberstad, CEO of Norsk Luftambulanse AS. “Due to its reliability in difficult weather and terrain, the H135 has been our helicopter of choice for years. The demanding operations in Norway and Denmark depend on advanced equipment and skills, and the deliveries from Airbus have proven to be most suitable for us for many years. With the improvements of the coming H135 we expect to have the right tool for our missions in the coming years,” said Kobberstad.

In addition, the H135 has a variety of proven features such as its capability to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR) and its excellent performance in OEI (one engine inoperative) conditions.

Norsk Luftambulanse’s H135 is also equipped with Airbus Helicopters’ new optimized multifunctional floor, which is specifically tailored for emergency medical services missions.

Airbus Helicopters has delivered nearly 1,200 helicopters of the H135-family to customers around the globe, which have logged more than three million flight hours. One-quarter of this total fleet is deployed for EMS duties."
