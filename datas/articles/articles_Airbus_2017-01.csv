Milestone: Airbus Engineering celebrates decade in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvYWlyYnVzLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said there is a lot to celebrate when it comes to Airbus and Alabama.

“We are especially proud of the impact of the Airbus Engineering Center and its employees, who are recognized as key contributors to the global Airbus network,” he said.

PROUD PARTNERSHIP

During today’s event, Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson read a city proclamation naming Jan. 30, 2017, Airbus Engineering Day in the city.

The Airbus Engineering Center opened in January 2007 with a goal of housing 150 engineers primarily focused on cabin engineering and design on the new A350 XWB aircraft. Today, the center is home to more than 200 engineers and support staff working on nearly all of the commercial aircraft products in the Airbus fleet family.

Barry Eccleston, CEO of Airbus Americas Inc., said the Mobile Aeroplex facility has forged a strong partnership with the Mobile community.

“Our employees and their families are a vital part of the community where they live and work. Their contributions through various charitable activities and STEM education are invaluable, and a vital part of ensuring Mobile’s success,” he said.

“We truly believe we are investing in their future and ours with every activity. We are proud of our partnership with Alabama and Mobile, and we are grateful for the enthusiastic welcome we have received over the past decade. We’re building great things together.”

“We had a choice of lots of places to go, lots of places to establish our engineering home and our industrial home. And we chose this community — we chose this state, we chose this community — because it was the best environment we could find.”

Over the past decade, the Airbus Engineering Center has paid $180 million in salaries, spent $6 million with local companies and donated $525,000 to the community through education program, the United Way and various other charities.

Allan McArtor, chairman and CEO of Airbus Group, told those gathered for the event that the relationship between Alabama’s Port City and the European aerospace giant has been mutual beneficial.

“People tell me, all the time, and all of us at Airbus, ‘Thank you for coming to Mobile,'” McArtor said, according to an AL.com report. “OK, we get that, we understand that this is important, for us to be here in Mobile. But it’s thanks to you, thanks to the community in Mobile.

“We had a choice of lots of places to go, lots of places to establish our engineering home and our industrial home. And we chose this community — we chose this state, we chose this community — because it was the best environment we could find. So thank you Mobile for creating that opportunity for us,” McArtor added."
Where's your flying car? Airbus might be flying it in Oregon this year - GeekWire,"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE3L2ZseWluZy1jYXItYWlyYnVzLW9yZWdvbi12YWhhbmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group says it’s on track to test its prototype self-piloted flying car by the end of the year, and those tests may well take place in Oregon.

The European consortium’s CEO, Tom Enders, talked up the vision for Airbus’ Urban Air Mobility division today at the DLD tech conference in Munich. The plan would let passengers use smartphone apps to book rides in electric-powered, vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles.

“One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground. Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” Reuters quoted Enders as saying. “We are in an experimentation phase. We take this development very seriously.”

Airbus has been pursuing its flying-taxi initiative since last year. One concept, known as Vahana, involves developing a new type of vehicle for individual passenger and cargo transport.

Last November, Airbus’ A3 development lab in Silicon Valley struck a deal with Modern Technology Solutions and SOAR Oregon to identify and resolve technical issues related to Vahana and conduct a flight demonstration at a SOAR Oregon test range.

Another concept, called CityAirbus, would adapt helicopter-style vehicles to carry multiple passengers. Airbus says passengers would book their rides using an app, head for the nearest helipad and climb aboard. CityAirbus’ planners project that the shared flight should cost about as much as a taxi ride for each passenger.

The scheme was flight-tested at last year’s Sundance Film Festival in Utah, with Airbus and Uber teaming up to provide on-demand helicopter rides. Uber has been experimenting with a similar service called UberChopper.

Enders said new paradigms for electric-powered aerial transportation could reduce urban pollution and congestion, and reduce the need for new infrastructure. “With flying, you don’t need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads,” Reuters quoted him as saying.

Airbus Group is investing in Urban Air Mobility to take advantage of today’s rapid advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous control, Enders said. “If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business,” he said.

In 2015, a NASA study determined that flying air taxis could become as cheap as taking an Uber ride, and cost a third as much in some urban settings."
First new Airbus in decades arrives in Iran - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDE3LzEvMTIvZmlyc3QtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1pbi1kZWNhZGVzLWFycml2ZXMtaW4taXJhbtIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXkvMjAxNy8xLzEyL2ZpcnN0LW5ldy1haXJidXMtaW4tZGVjYWRlcy1hcnJpdmVzLWluLWlyYW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A321 jet, purchased after the nuclear deal with world powers, will mainly be used for domestic flights within Iran.

The first Airbus passenger plane ordered by IranAir in decades after the lifting of international sanctions on the Islamic Republic has landed in the capital, Tehran, according to Iranian media.

The new A321 jet arrived at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday on a flight from the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

The head of IranAir, Farhad Parvaresh, called the delivery a “sunny day” for relations between Iran and Europe, and a memorable one for aviation in the nation of 80 million people.

Iran nuclear deal one year on: Expectations v reality

The 189-seat plane, already painted in IranAir’s livery, is the first of 100 ordered from Airbus following a deal reached in 2015 between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on the country’s nuclear activities.

“The average age of the IranAir fleet, that carries around six million passengers each year, is 25,” Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said.

“This is a big achievement for President Hassan Rouhani and his current government as well as the Iranian people who have been extremely worried about the state of the country’s airlines and passenger planes.”

IranAir has also ordered 80 aircraft from Boeing and is in the final stages of negotiating an order for 20 turboprops from Toulouse-based ATR, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo Finmeccanica.

The A321 will primarily be used for domestic flights within Iran, the airline said.

First since 1979

Highlighting Iran’s emergence from years of isolation, the Airbus delivery marks the first new jet directly acquired from a western manufacturer since 1979, other than the replacement of an Airbus jet shot down by the US Navy in 1988.

Both Airbus and Boeing need US export licences to deliver the jets because of the number of US parts.

Both have received licences, but Boeing needs to have the majority extended due to the lengthy delivery period and analysts expect it to point to the Airbus delivery in order to press the case for its sales to remain in force.

Parvaresh said that he hoped the US would not block the agreement under President Donald Trump, who at times has pledged to pull Washington out of the nuclear accord.

“Everything has been done according to the international regulations and rules up to now. We hope that nothing special happens to end this contract,” Parvaresh told reporters.

The first Airbus aircraft will enter service on Saturday starting on busy domestic routes such as Tehran to Mashhad for the next couple of months, he said.

IranAir hopes to receive “at least two more from Airbus” by the start of the Iranian new year in March, and a total of six A320 aircraft in calendar year 2017, he added. It also expects to receive three larger A330 jets in 2017."
Wing of the future - Airbus,"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAxLXdpbmctb2YtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Increased demands in performance and production rates require a radical new approach to the design and manufacturing of aircraft wings. In Filton, a multifunctional team is working to create the wing of the future.

No one can be quite sure how the next generation of aircraft wing will be. It may be shaped differently or assembled in a new way. It could be made of composite or advanced metallic materials. However, one thing is for sure: with aircraft production rates set to ramp up significantly, wings will need to be faster, easier and cheaper to make and assemble.

With such a range of factors to consider, creating the wing of the future will be no easy task. This is the challenge facing Airbus’ Wing of the Future programme, which will explore the best materials, manufacturing and assembly techniques, as well as new technologies in aerodynamics and wing architecture. Set up in 2015 and based in Filton, UK, this multifunctional team will select and develop a range of innovations in preparation for full-scale demonstrations.

“There are a number of reasons behind setting up the programme now,” says Tim Galsworthy, who is leading the team. “We need to ensure our aircraft perform as well as they can in the future, particularly in terms of fuel efficiency. And we also have to be able to meet new production rate targets. This is totally new ground for the industry.”

With this in mind, the Wing of the Future programme has engineering and manufacturing teams working closely together. “It’s all interlinked: we have to design the product alongside the factory. Stand-alone solutions may look good on paper, but everything has to fit together,” says Galsworthy, who has worked on the A380, A400M and A350 XWB during his time at Airbus.

New materials represent a major part of the programme and the team is already looking at lower-cost composite technologies. This could enable wing components to be produced with significantly reduced equipment and tooling costs, along with enabling a faster production cycle.



A greater use of composite materials also opens up new possibilities in terms of wing configuration and construction as fewer individual components are required. Airbus is working closely with the UK’s National Composite Centre (NCC) for this project in a bid to “push the boundaries of composites manufacturing way beyond the current capabilities”, says the NCC’s Aerospace Lead Steve Suddell. “It’s exciting for us to work so closely with Airbus’ brilliant engineers to develop completely new manufacturing processes. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity that could have a widespread impact: what the aerospace industry does today, other sectors will do in several years’ time.”

The programme will also investigate different wing sizes. Long, narrow wings can offer a high lift-to-drag ratio, which could improve fuel efficiency. However, wing length is restricted to a maximum length by airport regulations, which is why the team is experimenting with folding wing tips that could be extended before flight and folded back on the ground. Whether the gains in aerodynamic performance outbalance the extra weight and cost remains to be seen, says Galsworthy.

Helping the Wing of the Future team to perform such diverse and extensive testing is the recently announced Airbus Wing Integration Centre at Filton. Due to open in 2018, the facility will provide a state-of-the-art environment for Airbus in the UK, its suppliers and academic partners.

Investment comes from the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI): “We want to ensure the UK maintains its leading global position in wing development. Locating the centre at Filton enables us to build on the expertise and experience that is already there,” says Dr Simon Weeks, CTO at the ATI.

It’s too early to say precisely what this expertise and experience will produce in its search for the wing of the future. But as Galsworthy says, this is a project with a long-term mindset.

All you need to know about wings

While the basic parts always remain the same, wings come in many shapes and sizes. It all depends on the job the aircraft is designed to do. Planes with long and narrow straight wings use less fuel since they can glide better, but are not suited to quick manoeuvres. Aircraft with swept wings are very agile at supersonic speeds, but are no match when it comes to endurance.



The wing in detail

The history of aircraft wings

Aviation history expert Richard Gardner speaks about how the shape of wings have evolved over the last several decades.



Many of the first powered aircraft in the early 20th century were biplanes with two wings stacked one above the other – why was this?

A double wing provided extra lift without making the aircraft too big and provided a stiffer wing structure. At the time, aeroplanes only had enough power to lift the pilot and the aircraft. During the 1930s, metal began to be used more frequently instead of wood and fabric, and as speeds and therefore aerodynamic drag increased, biplane designs were gradually phased out.

What was the next major milestone in wing development?

By the end of the Second World War, we had jet-powered aircraft. This saw a huge increase in speed and higher altitude flight, so strength and performance requirements changed, resulting in new wing shapes, including swept wings, delta wings and crescent wings. All required extensive new aerodynamic research and testing in high and low-speed wind tunnels to produce aerodynamically efficient wings and empirical data to be entered into computer models to allow designers more flexibility in wing design.

Who were the most influential figures in wing development?

German scientists Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann working alongside other British scientists at Farnborough, carried out groundbreaking research in the UK after the Second World War. They identified, amongst other things, the junction of the wing and the fuselage and the shape of the wing tip as chief sources of aerodynamic inefficiency. Their work led to the development of Concorde’s unique wing in the 1960s and then the Airbus A300 in the 1970s, which was the first ever twin-engined widebody airliner. The advantages this wing design offered over its rivals in terms of performance and fuel efficiency were probably the most crucial aspect in Airbus’ early success, and this continues to this day in the present Airbus designs.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders made the announcement yesterday while speaking at the DLD digital tech conference in Munich, Germany,Reutersreports.

""One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,"" Enders said. He said flying cars would help reduce traffic and wouldn't command expensive supporting infrastructure because ""with flying, you don't need to pour billions into concrete and roads.""

Airbus is widely known for building commercial and passenger aircraft and helicopters. But last year it established a new ""Urban Air Mobility"" division dedicated to future personal transportation. The division is now called A³ (""A-Cubed"") and is based in Silicon Valley.

The division's main project is dubbed Vahana, ""a self-piloted flying vehicle platform for individual passenger and cargo transport,"" Airbus said in a company magazine article published last year. The company envisions a future where its autonomous flying vehicles will be hailed via an app, similar to Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services.

Airbus says these vehicles can carry multiple passengers and could be ready to launch in as soon as 10 years. The company hasn't provided details on its upcoming prototype, butReutersreports it'll be a one-passenger vehicle.

Airbus isn't alone with its flying car ambitions. Last year the EHang 184 passenger drone was unveiled at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. Meanwhile, Zee.Aero is another Silicon Valley-based startup looking into flying cars and reportedly has the backing of Google co-founder Larry Page.

Airbus plans to test self-driven airborne taxi by the end of 2017 - TechCrunch,"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxNy8wMS8xNi9haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdG8tdGVzdC1zZWxmLWRyaXZlbi1haXJib3JuZS10YXhpLWJ5LXRoZS1lbmQtb2YtMjAxNy_SAWhodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvMTYvYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLXRvLXRlc3Qtc2VsZi1kcml2ZW4tYWlyYm9ybmUtdGF4aS1ieS10aGUtZW5kLW9mLTIwMTcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is not kidding around about flying cars – the maker of airborne transportation vehicles plans to test out a prototype self-flying small urban transport made for single-passenger travel by the end of this year, according to Airbus CEO Tom Enders (via Reuters). Airbus has been developing its autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) concept through Project Vahana, an internal project designed to test viability and refine a prototype for urban air transport.

The project is something that Airbus takes “very seriously,” Enders told the DLD tech conference in Munich on Monday, noting that airborne transit for goods and individual passengers would actually be tremendously beneficial in terms of alleviating urban congestion, and reconfiguring how urban planners think about designing cities.

Vahana aims to have a viable production urban aircraft for short-haul trips available by 2021, and so actual prototype tests by the end of this year make sense given those timelines. In fact, the company previously said it was hoping to field a full-scale prototype sometime in 2017, so it looks like Enders is still committed to keeping his company to that timeline, including active flight testing.

The vehicle will likely use a four-rotor design with variable positioning possible to help with vertical take off, and then shift for propelling the craft through the air. The design process is taking into account what’s feasible and most efficient, given requirements like an electric motor, which Airbus is focusing on so that a fleet of the vehicles, once deployed, will not actually have a worse ecological impact than ground-based transportation in terms of contributing to air pollution.

Flying cars may still seem outlandish and primarily the province of science fiction, but helicopter-maker Airbus actually believes that they’d be ignoring the category at their peril, given the pace and progress of technology that can help make it possible, including autonomous driving systems and electric battery tech.

The proof will still be in the flying pudding, but at least now we could get a glimpse of that later this year. If Airbus can pull off the prototype, the biggest hurdle might be regulation – transporting humans by drone is still a big legal no-no in dense metropolitan areas, and it’ll be a challenge to prove its safety both to end users and municipal regulators."
Airbus to Test Self-Flying ‘Air Taxi’ in 2017 - VOA Learning English,"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLXRvLXRlc3Qtc2VsZi1mbHlpbmctYWlyLXRheGktdmVoaWNsZS1pbi0yMDE3LzM2ODE2OTkuaHRtbNIBbmh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtdG8tdGVzdC1zZWxmLWZseWluZy1haXItdGF4aS12ZWhpY2xlLWluLTIwMTcvMzY4MTY5OS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says it plans to test a prototype of a self-flying vehicle to transport people in the sky above busy city streets.

Testing of the “air taxi” is expected to begin before the end of the year, according to Airbus chief executive Tom Enders.

“One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” Enders recently told a technology conference in Germany. His comments were reported by Reuters.

Enders said that while Airbus is just starting to experiment with flying vehicles, it is taking the developments “very seriously.”

France-based Airbus is one of the largest airplane manufacturers in the world. It makes commercial aircraft, helicopters and space equipment.

The flying transporter project is being led by the company’s Urban Air Mobility division. The division was launched last year to explore the use of personal flying machines and helicopter-style vehicles in the future.

The vehicles would be part of a taxi-style service allowing riders to book through an app, the same way as car-sharing companies.

Enders said that in many ways, autonomous flying will be easier to manage than autonomous driving. But autonomous flying is still far behind self-driving technology, and therefore will take longer to become a reality, he added.

He said his company is investing now in autonomous flying technology to prepare for the inevitable future of self-flying vehicles.

“If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business,” Enders said.

He added that flying vehicles can greatly reduce costs for city infrastructure projects like roads and bridges. Airbus is looking at using electric vehicles to avoid adding more pollution to crowded cities.

Another Airbus official predicted that in as little as 10 years, flying vehicles will be on the worldwide market to “revolutionize urban travel for millions of people.”

Last October, ride-sharing company Uber announced plans to use flying vehicles in the future to avoid ground traffic around cities.

Uber’s plan would use small, fully electric aircraft that could take off and land like a helicopter, without the need for long runways. The company said its flying vehicles would also be much quieter and less polluting than helicopters.

Uber has said its planned flying service – which would eventually use pilotless aircraft – could launch within 10 years.

Valerie Castrillon, a manufacturing engineer at the Airbus facility in Mobile, normally works on the Flight Line. Here she is shown at the Final Assembly Line. Like many employees, she says the facility is well on its way to hitting a goal of producing four jetliners per month, a rate officials plan to hit in 2017. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com)

When an Airbus A321 begins to be born in Mobile, its future is literally laid out in front of it: Ahead of it in line, nose to tail, are three sister aircraft in various stages of completion. The newcomer is a wingless fuselage that's still in sections; the sibling at the far end, facing the exit, is almost ready for flight.

The jets advance across the workfloor as they progress through the stages of their assembly. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com)

For the hundreds of workers who take part in the process, the future is every bit as clear. In April, the Mobile Final Assembly Line (FAL) delivered its first A321. By the end of 2016 it had delivered 17. As impressive as that is, it represents a production rate of a little more than two jetliners per month - and the longtime expectation has been that in 2017, the plant will hit ""Rate 4,"" an output of four jets per month.

Airbus workers and leaders say they are quite confident they'll get there on schedule, and that they'll eventually go well beyond Rate 4. Their calm confidence belies the challenge: The complexity of ramping up a process this complex almost overshadows the process itself.

That doesn't simply mean working faster. Not when precision now equates to passenger safety later. It doesn't simply mean learning to follow a recipe, though Airbus has a comprehensive cookbook refined at other FALs. It doesn't mean ramrodding things through with a ""git 'er done"" spirit. Not when the workforce is learning what it really means to be part of a global company with a focused idea of the workplace culture it wants to cultivate.

What it means is, life changes.

******

Few could be happier about the way life has changed so far that Christopher Kantz of Ocean Springs, and few are more confident about the Mobile team's ability to meet the challenges of Rate 4.

That's good, because if Kantz was swamped now, it would be bad news for everybody.

Christopher Kantz, a specialist in Non-Destructive Testing at the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mobile, Ala. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com)

The 32-year-old is a specialist in non-destructive testing (NDT). ""I'm the guy they call if there's any kind of damage to the aircraft,"" he explains. ""Like while they're installing something, let's say they nick something with a tool. They call me out to make sure there's no further damage internally.""

Using ultrasound scanners and other equipment, he can ascertain whether that nick is merely cosmetic or a structural problem. He learned his trade in the Air Force, where he worked on F-15s and F-16s, and in the Air Force Reserves, where he continues to service C-130 Hurricane Hunters out of Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi. He's also worked in shipbuilding and refinery environments. He's used to seeing welders cringe as he looks over their work.

He was drawn to Airbus partly because he knew aircraft manufacturing would mean clean, climate-controlled conditions. ""Refineries and shipyards are really a rough environment,"" he said. ""A lot of hard work, a lot of long hours.""

But he wasn't just taking the easy way out. He took a ""significant"" pay cut to sign on, he said. Then he spent three months at the Airbus FAL in Toulouse, France, and a month at the one in Tianjin, China. Along the way he began to see that Airbus was serious about having a ""speak-up"" culture and a disciplined approach to resolving problems. Employees were expected to say something if they saw a problem, or had made a mistake. And every problem would be analyzed to look for flaws in the underlying process and for comprehensive solutions rather than quick fixes.

To anyone cynical about environments where workers learn to keep their heads down or face reprisal, it might sound too good to be true. Kantz and other Airbus employees say the difference is real.

""I have never worked in a job, besides the military, where I could actually feel comfortable going to, let's say, the HR department with an issue, whether it be a positive or negative issue,"" Kantz said. ""But I feel like I can definitely approach the level of management I need to, no problem. I don't have any problems with worrying about going out of your chain of command or telling someone the wrong thing ... To me, I feel like this company is really open. I feel really comfortable here.""

So does Richard Ward, 39, even though he says that learning ""the Airbus way"" has been a challenge. He's a team leader on Station 41, where the two halves of the fuselage are put together.

Major A320 components are made in Europe; the wings, for example, are constructed in Broughton, Wales. Every jet built in Mobile arrives in pieces - wings, two fuselage sections, vertical stabilizer and other components - transported via a shipping process so intricate that it was featured on the Science Channel show ""Mega Shippers.""

Ward and the crew at Station 41 join the two halves of the fuselage together into what he jokingly calls ""the submarine,"" a wingless tube. ""We drill and countersink and install more than 3,000 fasteners,"" all by hand, he said.

Ward came to Airbus with 15 years of manufacturing experience at a UTC Aerospace Systems facility in Foley. But he still had to go through a lot of training to learn the Airbus way of doing things. He spent seven months in Hamburg, Germany, and says it was a revelation.

At first it was daunting, Ward said, but over time, just walking around the German port city became a lesson in the way people in another culture can do things differently, yet effectively. ""It's amazing the experience and what we can learn from them the same as they can learn from us,"" Ward said.

Ward describes his former employer as ""a great company to work for,"" but can't conceal his enthusiasm for what he's doing now.

""I just built parts that went on the aircraft. Now I'm actually building the aircraft,"" he says. ""To me it's a pretty big deal.""

For Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager for the FAL, that international education process has been critical, on a couple of levels.

""Airbus is process-strong. Extraordinarily process-strong,"" he says. ""The way to build an A320 is very well known. What we've had to do is transfer that knowledge.""

But it's not a top-down process, he stressed. When Airbus opened its FAL in China, lessons learned there were implemented in Europe. The company drew on its knowledge base in Europe and China to build the FAL in Alabama - but the Mobile plant is finding new refinements.

Taylor offers a nuanced perspective on the Mobile operation's progress in 2016. Delivering 17 jets is a huge accomplishment, he says, but that's also ""17 out of a little over 7,000"" that Airbus has built. What's important, he says, is that ""We don't think of ourselves as a satellite facility."" They're a part of the whole, as integral as the other FALs.

Comments of employees certainly seem to reflect that.

""I know management has gotten our perspective,"" said Kantz.

""They're actually learning things from us, too,"" says Ward. ""It's amazing the experience and what we can learn from them the same as they can learn from us.""

Airbus employees Andrew Sikkens, left, and Richard Ward, are shown at the Final Assembly Line in Mobile. (Lawrence Specker/LSpecker@AL.com)

""We still pick up on little design details,"" says Manufacturing Engineer Andrew Sikkens.

Sikkens didn't come to Airbus with years of aviation experience like Ward and Kantz. He's 23, fresh out of Auburn University. Like most newer employees, he didn't get to go to Europe - Europe came to him, in the form of the international assortment of guest workers who've helped establish operations in Mobile. In company parlance they're known simply as ""the expats.""

In the beginning, he says, ""We'd have to get a lot of direction from our expat colleagues ... As we solved more similar problems we became more independent.""

""It's such an international work environment,"" Sikkens says. ""They're trying to teach us as much as possible before they go back home.""

""It's been an experience to have the expats here. We all get along and we work great together,"" says Ward. But their job is to transfer knowledge, and the Americans will have to fly on their own. ""I've told my team, we've got to start making our own decisions,"" Ward says.

The international fusion brings up another issue, a cultural one. What happens when the Airbus way meets the American way?

*****

Even though Sikkens is a trained engineer, he's quite familiar with the American ""Git 'er done"" spirit, that approach to problem-solving that uses brute force, duct tape and improvisation to achieve a one-time solution to an immediate problem. His family background is in agriculture, he says, and that approach works. In a jet factory, he says, ""you've got to do it by the book, every time.""

It should be noted that Airbus officials such as Jennifer Ogle, the director of human resources in Mobile, shudder at the very mention of duct tape, however metaphorical. ""Quality and project safety go hand in hand,"" Ogle says.

""What we say [to new employees] is, we don't make widgets here,"" Ogle says. ""Be sure about what you're doing. Because if you don't do what is required to meet the quality and product safety standards, people can die.""

""We reinforce that on a regular basis,"" Ogle says. ""But if Airbus does one thing well, it's that we have completely robust and mature processes and structures in place from a quality standpoint that could prevent anything like that from happening ... When you get into understanding how the aircraft comes together, there is a backup for a backup for a backup for a backup. Take landing gear as an example. There are three backups in place. That extends through everything that touches the build of the aircraft.""

Much of that would be true of any aerospace facility. But merging American workers into an international company requires another layer of finesse. The Americans have pride in their strengths, but also have lessons to learn as they adapt to the Airbus way. Getting the best of both worlds is a bit of a balancing act.

""We're just kind of like, 'All right, we're hungry, give us more work to do,'"" said Kantz. ""I think that's an American mentality, to be honest. We do work a lot, I don't want to say harder, but we work longer"" and expect less off time.

""Going to Germany showed us how another culture does it,"" Ward says. ""'Okay, wait a minute, we can adapt a lot of this into our culture.' And we have.""

Taylor, typically, offers a nuanced view, one that in this case is shaped by personal experience. He's a native of Wales, and early in his career he worked as an engineering apprentice at that wing-making facility in Broughton. But he's spent 20 years or so in North America, working for a variety of aerospace companies including Canada-based Bombardier and US-based Hawker Beechcraft Corp. and GKN Aerospace. Airbus hired him in August 2015 to oversee production at its new North American facility. He said that after 20 years in North America, he tends to identify as one of the natives.

It's nice to say Americans are hard workers, but that in itself is not unique. Everywhere Airbus has a presence, people work hard, he says. Still, there is a different spirit.

""We have a way of wanting to be successful,"" he says. ""I think there's a natural tendency here for people to be customer-focused, to be relationship-focused.""

He also continues to be impressed by the support for the Mobile venture not just among the workforce, but among the community as a whole.

""The level of enthusiasm, I just couldn't believe it,"" he says of his impressions when he arrived in Mobile. ""I was told, when you get there you're going to find out it's a big deal. Somebody should have taken me aside and said, no, it's a REALLY big deal, and shaken me a few times.""

Excitement is good, when you're halfway up a mountain called Rate 4.

*****

Maybe ""mountain"" is overstating it. It seems difficult to find anyone who finds Rate 4 particularly daunting. Kantz doesn't.

""Not at all. I think we're already thinking about Rate 6,"" he says. ""We want to be better than Europe. We want to be the best FAL, on quality and everything ... A lot of people want to make Rate 6 without any issues.""

Valerie Castrillon, a Manufacturing Engineer who works on the Flight Line, offers an interesting insight: ""We're really not preparing for Rate 3,"" she says, ""we're preparing for Rate 4.""

What that means is that progress is incremental and steady, not a series of big stair-steps. Airbus doesn't bring in a whole raft of new employees to jump from Rate 2 to Rate 3. It doesn't build a road for Rate 3 and then repave with new lanes for Rate 4. It built its road once, and the FAL is gradually putting more traffic on it as it learns to do that efficiently and effectively.

Castrillon has a unique view of it all. Like Sikkens, she's fresh out of Auburn University. Like many Airbus workers, she has a bit of an accent - but she's no expat. Originally from Peru, she went to high school in Florida and then started working on a business degree at Auburn, before shifting to engineering. For her, life started changing fast in May: ""I graduated from Auburn, the next day I got my American citizenship, the next day I got a job from Airbus,"" she says.

As the name indicates, the Flight Line is where an aircraft actually is prepped for its first flights and evaluated afterward. ""That's when we start doing the testing,"" Castrillon says. ""The real testing.""

She doesn't go up with the planes, but she takes notes when the pilots are debriefed. ""We write everything down, we log it,"" she says, no matter how trivial. ""We look into everything.""

It's an exacting process, because the next step is delivery. Any cosmetic issues have to be cleaned up before the aircraft is examined by its buyer; anything that affects performance has to be fixed. In a way, Castrillon's job is like Kantz's: She's in quality control, and if she was swamped now, that would be a lousy omen for the future.

But she smiles when she says that ""It's different every time for every aircraft."" And her eyes positively light up when she says that the Mobile Flight Line ""had the advantage of starting from zero."" Some would find that daunting, but to her it means the opportunity to improve the process itself. ""I love it,"" she says.

""We're unique here in Mobile,"" says Castrillon, with pride. But she's hardly discounting the other FALs. She trained in Hamburg and values the sense of company unity. ""They're willing to work with us. They take our ideas and we help each other,"" she says. ""It's very important to be harmonized with other FALs.""

Because her work on every jet is different, there's a certain element of unpredictability to the job. ""The aircraft is ready when the aircraft is ready,"" Castrillon says. When someone from another department inquires if that's the case, she says, the running joke on the Flight Line is, ""Let's ask the aircraft.""

Paradoxically, she says, the job hasn't become harder as production has increased. ""It's become easier,"" she says. ""You're more used to doing it.""

That was the plan all along, Taylor says: To create the process and then operate it faster, more efficiently and more effectively. Airbus deliberately did a lot of hiring up-front, Ogle adds. That was expensive, she says, but it meant the company wouldn't be trying to bring in big clumps of newcomers later, once production was under way. It could accelerate the process more smoothly. (The company currently employs about 360 people in Mobile.)

There's a little bit of a danger there. Airbus held big public celebrations for its first delivery, its 10th, its 15th. But when you're engaged in an ongoing incremental escalation, when every jet brings a fresh set of performance targets, you can forget to give yourself credit for what you've accomplished so far. Taylor says ""It's easy to not celebrate along the way,"" but even so, there are internal milestones.

When the plan to build the North American FAL really began to take shape in 2013, Taylor says, the goal was to deliver 16 aircraft in year one of production. That was an ambitious target, he says, and hitting it ""was a very emotional connection for a lot of people involved with the project,"" he says.

At some point the goal was bumped up to 17, and the FAL hit that with more than a week to spare. That was huge. ""We've been more successful than we can believe,"" Taylor says.

""You celebrate and you move on,"" he says.

""There's no change that comes in January or February that suddenly makes us go faster,"" says Taylor. ""We're not going to do anything different to build at Rate 4.""

""We have a really eager work force of highly talented people,"" Taylor says. ""That in itself is how we get to Rate 4. That's the magic sauce.""

******

One fact of life for Airbus workers in Alabama is that when people find out you work there, they have questions. Lots of questions. Even Taylor said he occasionally gets inquiries about hiring, when all he's trying to do is pick up lunch at a drive-through.

""You can't walk out the door wearing a Airbus shirt, hat or jacket,"" without getting stopped, says Ward. ""Anything that has Airbus on it, the first question you're going to get - 'Do you work at Airbus?' 'Yes.' 'How do I get a job there?'""

But there's also a general interest. ""They're just surprised how big these aircraft are,"" Ward says. ""There's so much pride, actually, around this area. They enjoy watching how many we can deliver.""

Castrillon said her college friends are curious about the work environment. She said she's keen to explain to them that she doesn't feel like she's working for a branch office of a foreign company. ""I always brag about how I get to work with French and German people. I love the international environment here,"" she says. ""Airbus is not French. It's global.""

How does one get hired? There are a few tips. Ogle says that when Airbus evaluates potential new employees, it doesn't just look at technical abilities.

""We may not be hiring 20 people a month like we did in the beginning, but we still hire people every single month, because we're ramping up,"" she says.

""We're trying to evaluate how they communicate, how they work together as a team,"" she says. ""It's every bit as important as their technical skills. And we really continue to look for people, as we did in the beginning, people that are open-minded, that can learn a new way of working.""

""Even without the expats here, we have a very diverse organization,"" Ogle says. ""And we pride ourselves on that. We embrace people who want to work with people they've never been around before, people from different countries, or different cultures, or different backgrounds.""

Castrillon says she thinks that having international experience helps, as does knowing a second language. Kantz says, ""If it wasn't for the military, I wouldn't be here."" He touts the Air Force as being a particularly good for training in technical skills valued in the civilian world.

On a more personal level, Airbus employees know that as life has changed, so have they. Kantz said that even if he doesn't talk overtly about it, his friends and family can see a difference.

""From the outside looking in, they've seen my attitude change, they've seen my lifestyle change. As in, when I go home at night, I'm not stressed,"" he says. ""My family life has gotten better. My personal life has gotten better. I see my kids more.""

Sikkens says he's still dazzled by the scale of it. His mother is an aquaculture expert who works at Auburn University. In a family discussion, he says, the figure came up that Alabama's catfish industry has an annual economic impact in the range of $150 million.

""That's about two aircraft,"" he says."

Commercial aircraft giant Airbus has come up with a way to mature its aircraft faster. The French manufacturer has created its own simulated airline to replicate the way the world's commercial carriers use and look after their airplanes. Dubbed AIRLINE1, the concept was introduced in 2013 to speed development of Airbus' new A350 XWB (a Boeing 787/777 competitor) by reducing the technical issues that typically surface after new airliners enter service.

In essence, AIRLINE1 is a new way of developing Airbus airliners—a system that allows the flight test team to think and operate as an airline would during flight testing and certification. An airline maintenance control center in a dedicated hangar at Airbus' Flight Test Center in Toulouse, France is its main component. As the A350 flight test program unfolds, the company's test team does real-time maintenance, support, and repair operations on test aircraft using the procedures and even the documentation Airbus customer airlines use.

""Our flight test team, the planning team, the production team, the quality team, the engineering teams, they all manage the airplane and its data like an airline does,"" says Philippe Garnier, Airbus' vice president of A350XWB maturity and operability. ""We try to operate the aircraft like an airline would. We monitor its systems and use airline technical documentation to maintain the aircraft just like an airline.""

The AIRLINE1 concept was first tried on the A350-900, the debut model for Airbus' A350 XWB family of airliners. The five A350-900 test aircraft involved in the model's flight test program in 2013-2014 were guinea pigs of sorts for the idea. It was an experiment that worked, says Garnier. That's why Airbus has relaunched AIRLINE1 for development of the next A350 model, the larger A350-1000, and will apply the simulation to all of its future aircraft.

In the Flight Test Center's airline-modeled maintenance control center, the various flight test teams conduct ""flight watching,"" monitoring A350-1000 components and systems via the airplane's onboard maintenance system. The system and this kind of monitoring are a departure from past flight test programs wherein special telemetry equipment was fitted to new airliners to monitor and send tech data to the test team. The A350 XWB performs this function on its own, ""announcing"" system or part failures to the cockpit crew and sending the notification to the test teams. It's a process A350 XWB customer airlines will use when they put the aircraft into service.

""If we have a failure we try to understand it to see if it is a maturity issue or not,"" Garnier explains. ""Then we take action during the flight test campaign as an airline would in normal in-service operations. If you have a technical issue in-service you need to identify the issue and then identify the solution. We do that by flight-watching the aircraft, capturing all failures in real time and then we launch an investigation. When you've identified a fix, you install it and test it, using the technical processes the airlines use. That allows you to better develop or mature an aircraft for airlines.""

Garnier notes that AIRLINE1 is as much a change in the culture for the flight test teams as it is a bundle of airline procedures and practices.

""It's a cultural change for us. We've made progress from A350-900 to A350-1000. We've discovered new things, adapting the process, and we're thinking more and more like an airline, learning what we need to do as an airline would. Now it's really becoming a habit to work on the aircraft like an airline.""

AIRLINE1 tenets will be more thoroughly applied to the three A350-1000 test aircraft, Garnier says, with sharper focus on visual inspections of the A350-1000's airframe and the cabin, employing airline-standard operating procedures for preflight and cockpit preparation as well as referring to airline technical documentation for troubleshooting.

""We're trying to be much more exhaustive in capturing details as an airline will, everything from working on the aircraft itself to the support systems we are developing for our customers,"" Garnier emphasizes. ""AIRLINE1 changes our focus from aircraft development exclusively in a flight test environment to aircraft development in an airline environment.""

Airbus Helicopters CEO hopes for stable sales in 2017 - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWNlby1ob3Blcy1zdGFibGUtc2FsZXMtMjAxNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said he will be happy with around 400 deliveries in 2017 and believes it will be “difficult to log more than 350 to 400” orders this year — a target that would represent stable numbers compared to 2016. Meanwhile, the Marignane, France-based manufacturer is striving to complete the H225’s return to service.

For this year, a book-to-bill ratio of one is a good target, Faury said on Jan. 27 during a conference call with media. He expects his company’s military sales to account for a similar percentage, in value, to last year’s proportion (57 percent). In terms of units, civil deliveries will remain the vast majority, he added.

What about a “Trump factor” on sales? Any consequence of Donald Trump’s new policies for the U.S. could only be positive, Faury predicted.

In the middle of 2017, Airbus Helicopters will break ground on its first final assembly line in China. The first H135 to be built in the new factory is scheduled to be delivered in 2019. It will be part of a 100-aircraft agreement with Sino-German firm Ecopark.

The year 2019 will probably be a busy one for the company, as the first flight of a high-speed helicopter demonstrator is planned for then as well. Developed in the framework of Europe’s Clean Sky 2 research initiative, it will be a follow-on to the X3 compound helicopter demonstrator that first flew in 2010. Faury promised to give more details at the Paris Air Show in June.

In 2019, too, Airbus plans a manned flight of its “urban vertical take-off and landing object,” dubbed CityAirbus. Fully electric, it is being promoted as a solution to urban traffic congestion. The design is for one pilot and four passengers.

Development is under way at Airbus’ sites in Donauwörth and Ottobrunn, Germany. The first unmanned flight is being arranged for next year. No timeframe, however, is available for entry into service. “We need to test a prototype, develop a regulation with the authorities and work on the business model,” Faury explained.

Commenting on orders and deliveries in 2016, Faury said total net orders stood at 353, or 20 more than in 2015. It was a “sign of good resilience,” he said. The backdrop last year was “the lowest order intake since 2008 for the whole industry.” Orders, including military ones, were down by 13 percent from 2015.

Airbus managed to maintain leadership in the industry with a claimed 47 percent market share in civil and parapublic applications for turbine helicopters heavier than 1.3 metric tons (2,865 pounds, which excludes the slightly smaller Robinson R66). Civil helicopter deliveries in that segment around the world totaled 541 last year, according to Airbus.

Super Puma family orders improved significantly, at 23 in 2016, up from two in 2015. Faury would not break the number down between the H215 and the H225, which remains grounded in the U.K. and Norway following a fatal H225 crash in Turøy, Norway, in April 2016.

According to Faury, practically all military Super Pumas are now flying. Meanwhile, on the commercial side — excluding offshore oil-and-gas operations — more than 50 percent have returned to service since the European Aviation Safety Agency lifted its grounding of the model in October.

Return to service is much slower in offshore oil-and-gas and is said to be close to 10 percent, happening mainly in Asia. “We are fully aware we need to ensure a smooth return to service and rebuild confidence,” Faury said.

The unsatisfactory safety record in the North Sea — which is not solely due to technical problems, Faury noted — has led Airbus to do some brainstorming. “We believe there is a much broader use of HUMS [health and usage monitoring systems] to be made, maybe no longer HUMS as we see them today, but more monitoring of the helicopter, better use of data, more sensors on board, data being transferred, digital products and services; we see digitization enabling new safety standards,” Faury stated.

As for the offshore oil-and-gas market, despite the upward trend in oil price, there is still a lot of overcapacity, so “we do not count on a significant uplift over the next couple of years,” he said.

The X6 program, targeted at succeeding the Super Puma, is said to be proceeding regardless of the short-term “ups and downs” of the offshore oil-and-gas industry."

Start of major fleet modernisation

Iran Air takes delivery of its first new aircraft<br /> <br /> Registration : EP-IFA<br />

Iran Air has taken delivery of its first new aircraft, an A321, in a handover ceremony in Toulouse with Mr. Farhad Parvaresh, Iran Air Chairman and CEO, and Mr. Fabrice Bregier, President, Airbus Commercial Aircraft and Chief Operating Officer Airbus, in the presence of Gael Meheust, SVP Sales and Marketing CFM, Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, and international media.The delivery is the first from a firm order placed by Iran Air in December 2016 for 100 Airbus aircraft (46 single aisle and 54 wide-body jets) to renew and expand its fleet.“This significant milestone marks the first practical step in Iran Air’s ambitious passenger aircraft fleet renewal and its stronger presence in international civil aviation. Iranian travellers can be proud with our selection of the world’s most modern single aisle aircraft,” said Mr Farhad Parvaresh, Iran Air Chairman and CEO. “Iran Air is delighted with this first Airbus delivery and congratulates everyone involved who made it possible. Today signals that with international collaboration and co-operation, we can achieve mutually beneficial commercial goals.”“Today is a momentous occasion and I congratulate Iran Air on taking delivery of it first new aircraft in many years. As we take these first steps together, we stand ready to support the development and modernisation of Iran Air,” said Fabrice Bregier, President, Airbus Commercial Aircraft and Chief Operating Officer Airbus. “Clearly in a country of 80 million people, there is a need for the latest passenger aircraft to meet domestic as well as international demand.Iran is forecast to require some 400 to 500 new aircraft to modernise as well as to grow its existing passenger fleet to catch up with years of pent up demand on domestic as well as international routes. The latest generation of fuel efficient aircraft will also allow new routes and markets to be exploited.The delivery complies with all relevant international laws. Airbus coordinated closely with regulators in the EU, US and elsewhere to ensure understanding and full compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPA). Airbus will continue to act in full compliance with the conditions of the US government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licences.Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2015, it generated revenues of €64.5 billion and employed a workforce of around 136,600. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as Europe’s number one space enterprise and the world’s second largest space business. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide."
Marriage of European Shipyards Could Augur 'Naval Airbus' - Defense News,"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uYXZhbC8yMDE3LzAxLzIzL21hcnJpYWdlLW9mLWV1cm9wZWFuLXNoaXB5YXJkcy1jb3VsZC1hdWd1ci1uYXZhbC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The long-awaited, much-needed consolidation of Europe's fragmented naval industry — which some believe could one day lead to a 'Naval Airbus' — may be about to take its first step with the planned acquisition of France's Saint-Nazaire yard by Italy's Fincantieri.





The irony is that if the naval business is about to finally consolidate, in the wake of steps taken by the land and air sectors, it would be less due to years of urging from analysts and managers, and more due to a big shove given by the luxury cruise ship industry, not to mention the bankruptcy of a Korean ship builder.





Fincantieri — Italy's biggest naval ship manufacturer — is on course to take control this year from Korea's STX of Saint-Nazaire, which recently built two Mistral helicopter carriers destined for Russia and later sold to Egypt, and is the only yard in continental Europe large enough to build an aircraft carrier.





The deal would be a coup for Fincantieri's veteran CEO Giuseppe Bono, who said last year, ""We must work together — Today there is competition between European firms but the competition should be between European firms and the rest of the world.""





Bono has pointed out how three European yards, Navantia, BAE and Fincantieri, are currently competing to sell frigates to Australia.

Adm. Matteo Bisceglie, Italy's head of naval procurement, agreed, telling Defense News last week, ""Industry cooperation in Europe, which is missing today, is the best way to sell naval and civil vessels to the world.""





Both Bono and Bisceglie were present in Rome in September at the presentation of a research paper which claimed European navies today cannot afford to build more than eight or ten frigates at a time. If firms teamed up, it argued, following the example of Airbus, as well as Germany's KMW and France's Nexter in the land sector, prices for ships would go down and more could be built.





The Centro Studi Internazionali, which published the research paper, said consolidation would be welcome news for the half-million employees of Europe's shipyards.





Fincantieri's Bono has been talking up European aggregation for years, and pushed hard for a European buy-out when the shipbuilding activity of Norway's Aker came up for sale in 2008. To his chagrin, Korea's STX was cleared for the purchase, although he was able to then buy the business from STX in 2012.





When STX went bankrupt last year, Bono got in line again, becoming the preferred bidder earlier this month to buy out a 66.66 percent stake in the business unit STX France, the owner of the Saint-Nazaire yard. The remainder is controlled by the French government.

Saint-Nazaire may build warships, but Bono's prime objective is taking over the yard's bulging, 12 billion Euro order book for luxury cruise ships — a line of business which is also currently thriving at Fincantieri.





The Italian yard is doing well out of a recent 5.4 billion Euro order for new navy vessels from the Italian government, but it also has 26 cruise ships on order, over one-third of the 73 ships now on order around the world.





""The European cruise industry has been in the hands of three firms — Fincantieri, STX and Germany's Meyer Werft, so this merger would reduce the field as huge investments are being made and the sector is going really well,"" said Nicola Capuzzo, a reporter at Italian shipping industry publication Ship2Shore.





""If military consolidation flows from the Saint-Nazaire deal, it will be thanks to consolidation in the cruise ship industry,"" he added.

""Saint-Nazaire is the only yard in Europe with a dock able to build vessels over 300 metres,"" said Francesco Tosato, an analyst at the Centro Studi Internazionali. ""That is good for the super cruise ships for which there is growing demand, but also makes it strategic for naval industry consolidation.""





A further twist came when the French government began to mull the idea this month of not only holding on to its own 33.4 percent share in the yard, which gives it veto powers, but also introducing state-controlled naval vessel builder DCNS as a shareholder.





""Putting DCNS in as shareholder would create the conditions for naval cooperation between it and Fincantieri, with French government backing,"" said Tosato.





""I would be pleased if this deal pushed cooperation between Fincantieri and DCNS,"" said Admiral Bisceglie, Italy's naval procurement chief.

A second Italian analyst said Fincantieri had the credentials to convince France it could be trusted with Saint-Nazaire, pointing to the firm's takeover of the Marinette Marine yard in the US in 2008, where it has built Littoral Combat Ships for Lockheed Martin.





""The US is mindful of letting non-US firms into strategic industries, yet it felt Fincantieri was reliable,"" said Michele Nones, head of the security and defense department at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a Rome think tank.





""It has shown it can control a foreign yard while increasing value,"" he added.





Talk of a naval equivalent to Airbus comes at an opportune moment, as the European Union talks up initiatives to create a unified military capability, something which will require greater consolidation among industrial suppliers.





Italy and France have previously built Fremm and Horizon frigates together in joint programs, although they are now competing against each other to sell Fremm frigates in export markets, while a torpedo-related team-up broke down.





Michele Nones said the prospects were not all good for Fincantieri and DCNS teaming again in the short term. ""After Fremm, there has been little drive to do another joint program, so there is nothing to build a partnership around,"" he said. ""They were talking about plans to build a logistics ship together, but the French pulled out,"" he said. Italy is building a new logistics ship as part of its large-scale fleet renewal program.





France may also insist on Fincantieri taking a stake smaller than 50 percent in Saint-Nazaire, limiting its control.





But Nones saw room for optimism. ""If Fincantieri can take over Saint Nazaire and DCNS takes a stake, it is certainly a step forward,"" he said.

UK Air Force Picks Airbus to Support A400M Fleet in $504M Deal - Defense News,"Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNy8wMS8wNS91ay1haXItZm9yY2UtcGlja3MtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtYTQwMG0tZmxlZXQtaW4tNTA0bS1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The British Royal Air Force's A400M Atlas transport aircraft fleet is to be supported by Airbus Defence and Space in a £410 million ($504 million) deal announced Jan 5.





The Defence Equipment and Support arm of Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement that the contract will secure maintenance, upgrade and repair support of the planned 22-strong fleet of Airbus-built aircraft through 2026.





The work will take place at the RAF's air transport hub at Brize Norton where a £62 million hanger capable of housing three Atlas aircraft at one go is on schedule to be fully equipped in the next few months.





The RAF fleet currently stands at 14 A400Ms following the delivery of two aircraft at the end of last year.





The fleet is scheduled to reach 22 in 2019 and be the backbone of the RAF's air-transport capability alongside smaller numbers of Boeing C-17 and Lockheed Martin C-130J aircraft.





The deal was single-source, but a spokesman for DE&S said the long-term intention is to look at the possibility of running a competition when what is known as the Medium Term Contract (MTC) comes up for expiry.





""A competitive process would have been impractical at this time as the aircraft is still in development and the fleet size is building. The intention is to consider competing the support service when the aircraft design and fleet is mature. The MTC is subject to single source pricing regulations, which ensures transparency in pricing and that value for money for the taxpayer is balanced with providing industry with a fair return,"" said the spokesman.





""The contract is for Airbus to provide the number of aircraft required for tasking, with the requirement based on the fleet size, and incentivizes sortie achievement,"" he said.





The spokesman said that up until now maintenance of the RAF aircraft had been conducted under an industry-led initial support contract involving Airbus subcontracting scheduled maintenance work to the engineering arm of Flybe, the British regional airline.





""This contract was signed in October 2014 and the MTC will build on this arrangement. RAF personnel work alongside Airbus to support UK and deployed flying operations as part of a single engineering organisation,"" said the DE&S spokesman.





A spokesman for Airbus said the arrangement with Flybe is ongoing and is set to expand as fleet numbers increase. ""Flybe provides pure MRO (base maintenance) complementary to what DE&S announced today. Their current dedicated workforce located at Brize Norton of 22 will grow to 41 as the fleet reaches its mature level,"" said the spokesman.





The MoD said the deal announced today would sustain around 200 jobs at Brize Norton. The Flybe contingent is in addition to the figures quoted, said Airbus.





The Airbus-led consortium Air Tanker also supports its fleet of A330 multi-role tanker and air-transport aircraft from facilities at Brize Norton.





Announcement of the contract follows on the heels of a deal late last year adding Spain to an Anglo-French global support service agreement managed by the European Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to pool spares and technical support, which has been running for the past two years.





The DE&S spokesman said they expected to see the global support arrangement expanded to include most of the nations involved in the A400M program.





""The six-nation global support arrangement will encompass Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Turkey and the UK,"" he said.





Industry executives cautioned, though, that any further expansion of the global support arrangement was some way off.





Malaysia and Luxembourg have also purchased the aircraft.

Airbus Earnings Hint at Sale of 16 Helos to Singapore - Defense News,"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNy8wMS8yNy9haXJidXMtZWFybmluZ3MtaGludC1hdC1zYWxlLW9mLTE2LWhlbG9zLXRvLXNpbmdhcG9yZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Figures released by Airbus Helicopters today appear to indicate that Singapore has ordered 16 H225M medium-lift helicopters.

The Southeast Asian island nation, which is a close regional security partner of the United States and a strong supporter of the U.S. security presence in the region, had announced in November that it had selected the Airbus Helicopters H225M and Boeing CH-47F Chinook to recapitalize its medium- and heavy-lift military helicopter fleets.

The new helicopters will replace the fleet of AS332M/M-1 Super Pumas and older CH-47D Chinooks currently operated by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). Neither Singapore's Ministry of Defence nor Airbus Helicopters have revealed the number of H225Ms Singapore has contracted for, although earlier reports had put the number of Super Puma replacements Singapore was seeking at 12 aircraft.

Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said today at a press briefing to announce its financial results that the division had logged 23 orders for the H215/225 Super Puma family in 2016, although an Airbus Helicopters spokesperson contacted by Defense News declined to give a breakdown of the number of customers for the type.

A check by Defense News showed however that Airbus Helicopters had announced orders for seven H215/225s from four customers other than Singapore throughout the year, which would leave 16 aircraft unaccounted for in its order books.





Typically very secretive about its military acquisition programs, Singapore normally makes its defense acquisitions in small, incremental batches, gradually building up experience on new equipment and avoiding spending spikes and troughs.



A Singapore Ministry of Defence spokesperson had previously said that the helicopters will be delivered from 2020, and it is expected that this will represent only the first batch of H225Ms to be acquired, with Singapore possibly looking to eventually acquire around 24-30 aircraft.

The RSAF currently flies approximately two dozen Super Pumas out of an original fleet of 34 ordered in 1983 and 1991, with two Singapore-based squadrons and a training detachment based at the Australia's Army Aviation Centre Oakey (AACO), which have primarily been used to support Singaporean army operations.

The type has also participated in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) missions throughout the region, and the aircraft are also used for regular medevac and search-and-rescue (SAR) missions throughout Singapore's large Search and Rescue Region (SRR), with one helicopter placed on 15-minute standby 24 hours a day.

The Airbus Helicopters H225M is a long-range tactical transport military helicopter developed from the Super Puma/Cougar family for military use. It has proven to be an export success in the Asia-Pacific, with the militaries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan all also using the type in various guises.

Singapore's long association with the Super Puma will mean a reduced learning curve to integrate the equipment into the RSAF's inventory. The reduced footprint from the H225M's folding rotor blades and tailboom compared to the Super Puma will also be useful for shipborne operations, with Singapore expected to use the H225Ms on a new class of Littoral Mission Vessels.

The country is also finalizing its requirement for new amphibious multi-mission ships with expanded helicopter facilities, which will almost be certain to operate the RSAF's H225M at some point when commissioned.

Airbus wants to test autonomous flying cars sometime this year - ReadWrite,"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vcmVhZHdyaXRlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYXV0b25vbW91cy1mbHlpbmctY2Fycy10bDQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French aerospace giant Airbus wants to have an autonomous car in the air by the end of the year, according to the group’s chief executive, Tom Enders.

Airbus claims the autonomous flying car will alleviate traffic problems in major cities and could reduce infrastructure budgets for city planners, who won’t have to worry about bridges, traffic lights, or concrete roads.

See also: Well, of course, Larry Page invested in two flying car startups

“One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” said Enders at the DLD tech conference in Munich. “We are in an experimentation phase, we take this development very seriously,”

Airbus formed the Urban Air Mobility division last year, to start work on a prototype flying car. It hopes to test this by the end of the year, but Enders said it would most likely be 2020 before any commuters hop into a flying car.

Flying cars aren’t choppers

The company also plans to build a semi-autonomous flying car, so the whole project isn’t gutted if regulations say a driver must be able to control the vehicle.

Airbus has a new business plan for the flying cars, not at all like its commercial helicopters, which are sold at a price only few can afford. It wants to develop an Uber-like app for the flying cars, where commuters can rent the autonomous vehicle for a single ride.

Interestingly, Uber also wants to have a service for flying cars, using Airbus’ concept.

The flying car reality might only be a few years away, but with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) already struggling to regulate the drone market, it might be an intense fight to allow humans inside autonomous flying vehicles."

TEHRAN, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- First Airbus A321 plane, which Iran purchased in the post-sanction era, landed in the capital Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, official IRNA news agency reported.

In December, Iran sealed a contract with Airbus to buy 100 aircraft worth over 18 billion U.S. dollars.

Iran's Minister of Road and Urban Development Abbas Akhundi and his deputies, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and a number of parliament members were present in the airport upon the arrival of A321, the report said.

The Managing Director of the country's flag-carrier Iran Air, Farhad Parvaresh, and the Chief Executive Officer of France's Airbus Company Fabrice Bregier were among the passengers of the A321.

On Wednesday, Iran formally received the commercial plane from Airbus in France's Toulouse.

The delivery of the A321, as Iran's first brand-new plane in over 37 years, is the first in a batch of 100 jets purchased by Iran Air recently to renew its aged passenger fleet."

TEHRAN, Jan. 12 (UPI) -- Iran celebrated delivery of the first new airplane to the country in decades on Thursday, holding a special ceremony on the tarmac after it landed at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran. The first of 100 planes ordered for Iranian airlines touched down in Tehran Thursday, marking the first visible fruits of the deal Iran cut with the rest of the world to drop crippling economic sanctions against the country if it discontinued its nuclear weapons program.

The 189-seat Airbus A321 flew to Iran from the company's facility in Toulouse, France, weeks after the Iranian government closed the deal after two years of negotiations to finalize what turned out to be an $18 billion deal.

""We struggled for two years to purchase planes from Airbus,"" Iran Air head Farhad Parvaresh told reporters during the celebration. ""There were many problems that still remained from the past and we had to go through a very difficult path to finalize the deal with Airbus.""

The deal -- for 46 A320s, 38 A330s and 16 A350 XWB jetliners -- are the first new planes bought by Iran since before 1979. Of the 250 commercial planes the country has, just 162 are operational because, in addition to being barred from buying planes, Iran couldn't buy spare parts to repair the planes they already had.

Until sanctions were lifted last January after the approval of Iran's deal to end its nuclear research program by the permanent members of the United Nations' security council, it is believed Iran kept the 162 or so working planes in the air using parts smuggled into the country.

Iranian officials consider the arrival of the first plan in the Airbus deal, as well as the eventual delivery of 99 more from Airbus and 80 the country has agreed to purchase from Boeing, as a symbol of Iran's waning economic isolation from the international community.

""[This is] a historic moment for Iran, signalling the end of the sanctions era for the country,"" said correspondents on the state-run official television network."
Global commercial aircraft deliveries fell in 2016 as Boeing again outsold Airbus; 2017 to be a peak | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2dsb2JhbC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtZmVsbC1pbi0yMDE2LWFzLWJvZWluZy1hZ2Fpbi1vdXRzb2xkLWFpcmJ1cy0yMDE3LXRvLWJlLWEtcGVhay0zMjE0MjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft deliveries fell in 2016 for the first time since 2010

According to preliminary figures from the CAPA Fleet Database, the total number of commercial aircraft of all sizes (but not including business jets) delivered in 2016 fell slightly from its 2015 level.

The Database recorded 1,665 deliveries in 2016 - a decline of less than 1% compared with 1,674 delivered in 2015.

Although the fall in numbers was very small, it was significant in being the first drop in deliveries since 2010, when they fell by 5% to 1,202. Deliveries then increased every year until 2015, growing overall by 39% over the five-year period (a compound average annual rate of 7% pa).

Boeing delivered more aircraft than Airbus once again

Focusing in on the battle for supremacy between Airbus and Boeing, 2016 was the fifth successive year in which the US manufacturer has delivered more aircraft than its European rival. Airbus has not achieved more deliveries than Boeing since 2011, which was the last year of a nine-year winning streak for Airbus.

Final delivery data for 2016 exceeded guidance for both manufacturers. Boeing delivered 748 aircraft, just above its target of 745-750 deliveries, while Airbus' 688 deliveries was comfortably above its aim for ""more than 650"".

Although Boeing outsold Airbus once again, the US airframer's 2016 deliveries figure was lower than its 2015 total of 762, whereas its European counterpart's 2016 level was up on its 2015 figure of 635.

Airbus and Boeing annual aircraft deliveries 1996 to 2016

The total global fleet grew by 4% in 2016; order backlog rose to 9.3 years of production

According to the CAPA Fleet Database, there was a total of 30,681 commercial aircraft in service at 31-Dec-2016, which was 4% more than at the end of 2015.

The number of outstanding firm orders at the end of 2016 was 15,496, an increase of 1.5% year-on-year. The order backlog was 51% of the number of aircraft in service at the end of 2016 (similar to the equivalent figure of 52% at the end of 2015).

Expressed as the number of years of production, the order backlog was equivalent to 9.3 years at the end of 2016, up slightly from 9.1years at the end of 2015 (where one year of production equates to the number of deliveries in the year just ended).

North America has biggest fleet among global regions; Middle East the smallest

By total fleet numbers, North America continues to be the biggest global region, accounting for more than 9,300 aircraft (as at 3-Jan-2016). Asia Pacific is the second biggest region, with more than 8,400 aircraft, followed by Europe, with just over 7,300.

Some distance behind the big three regions are Latin America (almost 2,400 aircraft), Africa (1,600) and, in last place - Middle East (close to 1,500 aircraft).

North America's fleet is the oldest; Latin America's the youngest

North America has the oldest aircraft, with an average age of 18.7 years at 3-Jan-2017, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. This is almost twice the average age of 9.5 years in Latin America, the region with the youngest fleet.

In Europe the fleet age averages 10.9 years, while the Asia Pacific fleet has an average age of 14 years. Africa has an average fleet age of 15.4 years, and Middle East has the second oldest at 16.9 years.

Asia Pacific has highest number of orders; Middle East has highest ratio of orders to current fleet

In spite of its having the biggest and oldest fleet, North America has only the third highest number of aircraft on order (2,194) among the global regions. Among the big three regions, North America has the lowest ratio of orders to aircraft in service, with a figure of 23%.

Asia Pacific has 4,589 orders, 55% of the number of aircraft in service and almost double the 2,263 on order in Europe - the region with the second highest number. Europe's orders represent 31% of its fleet in service.

Middle East, the smallest region among the six by aircraft numbers in service, rises to fourth place by aircraft on order. Its figure of 1,313 orders is 89% of the number of aircraft in service, which is an indication of significant future growth in the region.

Latin America has 795 orders, equivalent to 33% if its current fleet, while Africa has just 200 orders, which equates to only 14% of its fleet in service.

Widebody aircraft: Middle East has more on order than in service

The Middle East's future growth potential clarifies even more sharply when it comes to widebody aircraft, which are the main vehicle of global competition between the regions.

The Middle East has more widebody aircraft on order, 758, than the 718 that it has in service - a ratio of 106%. The 785 widebodies on order in the Middle East make almost the same number as the 775 in Asia Pacific, where the figure of 1,758 in service is more than twice the number of the Middle East's widebody fleet.

Asia Pacific's widebody ratio of orders to aircraft in service is 44%, the second highest among the global regions. Nevertheless, it is less than the 55% ratio that applies to its overall fleet, indicating that a disproportionate number of Asia Pacific orders are for intra-regional aircraft (narrowbodies and regional aircraft).

North America and Europe both have around 1,200 widebodies in service, but Europe's widebody order figure of 385 aircraft is 25% higher than North America's 309 orders.

North America's widebody orders are only 25% of its current widebody fleet. This is the lowest such ratio of any region and betrays a lack of intercontinental competitive ambition among North American airlines, who are more focused on the more concentrated domestic market. Europe's widebody orders are 32% of its widebody fleet in service - similar to the 31% ratio that applies to its total fleet.

Latin America has the equivalent of 33% of its widebody fleet numbers on order, the same ratio as for its overall fleet. In Africa, widebody orders represent 29% of its widebody fleet, more than double the 14% ratio for its total fleet. This suggests that African airlines (or at least some of them) are more focused on aircraft for long haul expansion (and/or replacement) than for intra-regional operations.

Aircraft deliveries set to rise again in 2017

The very small year-on-year fall in delivery numbers in 2016 will not be repeated in 2017, based on current data recorded in the CAPA Fleet Database.

Although at this stage of the year the number of deliveries is subject to some uncertainty and change, the total for 2017 is currently projected to rise by 19% to 1,986.

The historically very high order backlog has encouraged aircraft manufacturers to increase production rates.

Moreover, 2017's higher delivery expectations are also the result of the industry's need to catch up from delays to a number of new aircraft programmes that reduced numbers in 2016 (these included the Airbus A350 and A320neo and the Bombardier CSeries).

See related report: Bombardier C Series: record orders in 2016 as both variants finally enter service

Without these delays the number of deliveries might have been expected to rise in 2016 and again in 2017, albeit at a slower rate than is now projected for 2017.

Boeing to deliver more than Airbus for sixth straight year

Current data in the CAPA Fleet Database indicate that both Airbus and Boeing will enjoy year-on-year growth of 12% or 13% in delivery numbers in 2017 (growth rates assume 2016 deliveries in accordance with the companies' published guidance).

The Database suggests 2017 delivery figures of 732 for Airbus and 840 for Boeing - giving the US manufacturer a sixth successive year of outselling its European rival.

The unknown Trump factor, Boeing and China

Airlines and aircraft orders are notoriously conspicuous when it comes to political confrontations, particularly where trade issues are at stake. Incoming President Trump has relatively indiscriminately attacked China on several fronts, both politically - challenging the One China policy - and in trade terms - threatening among other things to levy taxes on Chinese exports to the US.

What he will do once in office is still everybody's guess, but there is a real chance of a US-China arm wrestle over trade conditions in 2017.

According to CAPA's Fleet Database, Boeing has 180 aircraft scheduled for delivery to China in 2017. These will be nervous times for the manufacturer's executives at 100 North Riverside, Chicago.

Deliveries may fall again in 2018; another pointer that airline industry margins may have already peaked

Looking further ahead, into 2018, is subject to even more uncertainty, but the CAPA Fleet Database currently suggests that total delivery numbers will fall to levels similar to the numbers achieved in 2016.

This indicates that 2017 could be a cyclical peak for deliveries (the mini-peak of 2015 was illusory, created by the drop in deliveries in 2016 caused by delays to new aircraft programmes).

In previous cycles a delivery peak has typically arrived after a peak in the airline industry's operating profit margin, although this pattern has been less visible over the past decade than in previous decades.

CAPA will update its twice-yearly forecast of the global airline operating profit margin later in Jan-2017 (last published in Jul-2016, see CAPA airline profit outlook. Record margins from capacity restraint, but upswings are not forever).

However, this deliveries outlook adds to the view that the airline industry experienced a margin peak in 2016 and may now be entering the downswing in its profit cycle."
Airbus beat Boeing to the sales crown and Iran was the difference - Business Insider,"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtdmVyc3VzLWJvZWluZy1pcmFuLWRlYWxzLXRoZS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLWluLXBsYW5lLWJhdHRsZS0yMDE3LTHSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ItYWlyYnVzLXZlcnN1cy1ib2VpbmctaXJhbi1kZWFscy10aGUtZGlmZmVyZW5jZS1pbi1wbGFuZS1iYXR0bGUtMjAxNy0xP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus and Boeing have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market.

On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing's tally of 668 for the year released a week ago.

Iran Air's first new Airbus A321. Airbus

Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight.

While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country.

It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions.

Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing's planes will be delivered from 2018.

Neither planemaker gave any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Airbus

A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the U.S. planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources, who declined to be named, said the company's year-end numbers had been strictly audited.

Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the U.S. export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on U.S. parts.

People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received U.S. export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies.

Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival's presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of U.S. Republican political opposition.

During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran.

The Iranian orders offer valuable respite from a slowdown in demand for both planemakers, with their combined new orders falling below deliveries for the first time since 2009.

Boeing posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89 for 2016. This would be at exactly 1 if the Iranian deal were included, with 748 orders and just as many deliveries, company data shows. Airbus would fall below that threshold without the Iran order.

Analysts said such margins show how relatively thin orders have become after a decade of mostly rampant growth, coinciding with growing indicators that the aerospace cycle is weakening.

Airbus sales chief John Leahy warned this week orders would stay weak in 2017, but said deliveries which drive profits would continue to grow for some time on the back of older sales.

The announcement was made by the aerospace group's CEO, Tom Enders, on Monday at the DLD digital tech conference in Munich.

During his keynote speech, Enders said Airbus is investing in driverless technologies and artificial intelligence, which could lead to them developing a fleet of flying cars.

""One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground. Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,"" he said, adding that he believed the company would be testing flying single-person transport by the end of the year.

""We are in an experimentation phase. We take this development very seriously,"" he said. ""If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business.""

Enders also noted how the development could affect city planning and infrastructure, saying that flying means you don't need to ""pour billions"" into concrete bridges and roads.

Related story Electric planes and passenger-carrying drones are the future, says Paul Priestman

The personal aircraft is being explored in Airbus' Project Vahana. The project grew out of the company's Urban Air Mobility initiative, dedicated to less-conventional vehicle concepts, like vehicles to transport individuals or helicopter-style vehicle that carry multiple riders.

The aim would be for people to book the personal aircraft using an app, similar to car-sharing schemes such as Uber.

Airbus has also been working on ""vertical take-off and landing"" (VTOL) technology that would allow vehicles to pick up passengers in busy urban areas, and has said it expects to be putting them into production by 2021.

""We seek to help enable truly vertical cities by opening up urban airways in a predictable and controlled manner,"" said the company in a blog post.

""We believe that full automation will allow us to achieve higher safety by minimising human error. Our aircraft will follow predetermined flight paths, with only minor deviations if obstacle avoidance is needed.""

Airbus' announcement appears to support transport designer Paul Priestman's prediction last year that passenger-carrying drones would be the future.

""We've got these electric drones flying around everywhere,"" he said. ""[Electric planes are] just a scaled up version really. I think that's going to get really interesting – it could be the beginning of personalised transportation.""

""It's like going back to the idea of jetpacks, but with lots of little drones,"" he added.

Airbus has filed a number of unusual patents over the years. In 2014 the company applied for a patent on bicycle-style seats that would replace seat cushions with saddles, and in 2015 filed one for two-storey passenger seating that would make the most of unused cabin space by stacking travellers one on top of another.

Most recently, the company patented removable aeroplane cabins for faster boarding."
A Look Inside RwandAir's First Airbus A330-200 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE3LzAxL3J3YW5kYWlyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLTIwMC10b3VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update 4/5/17 5:00pm: RwandAir has confirmed that it will launch A330 service to London's Gatwick Airport on May 26, 2017. Additionally, the airline stated in a press release that it could begin flights to New York later this year, however no additional details (such as a timeline or aircraft) have been provided. TPG's a big fan of Rwanda — he went trekking with gorillas there (see the TPGtv episode here) but had to connect in Ghana. A nonstop flight to Kigali (KGL) would make Rwanda much more accessible to travelers from the US.

RwandAir, the national airline and flag carrier of the Republic of Rwanda, took delivery of its first long-haul wide-body Airbus A330 aircraft in September of last year. It's a relatively young airline, only operating flights from its base in Kigali (KGL) since 2002. After the devastating Rwandan Genocide in 1994, the government decided it needed a reliable transportation link that would firmly connect the country to the rest of the world.

As a result, RwandAir has become the first East African airline to be a launch operator of the aircraft, a move considered to be the first step of RwandAir's expansion, along with introducing new routes to its expected long-haul network that'll eventually include destinations like London, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing — its current A330 aircraft are only flying between Kigali (KGL) and Dubai (DXB), Accra (ACC), Lagos (LOS) and Mombasa (MBA).

I had a chance to join the delivery flight of the first A330 from the carrier's Airbus order, flying from Toulouse, France, to Kigali, Rwanda, with a quick stop in Entebbe, Uganda, so government officials there could take a look at their neighbor's new plane.

The Aircraft

This is also the first time RwandAir has ever had its livery featured on a wide-body long-haul jet. Parked and ready for our delivery flight, the aircraft proudly displays its 'Fly the Dream of Africa' tagline.

This particular aircraft has been named 'Ubumwe,' which in the local Kinyarwanda language means 'Unity.'

I managed to take a quick walk underneath the 'factory fresh' aircraft.

The Cockpit and Galley

First up is the state-of-the-art flight deck on RwandAir's A330-200.

Safety placards around the aircraft are in English and French, the two official languages of Rwanda (after Kinyarwanda).

You may unsubscribe at any time.

This squeaky clean galley will be the workspace of the carrier's first long-haul cabin crew.

Business Class

Business class is located in the aircraft's forward cabin, made up of five rows in a 1-2-1 staggered configuration — translation: direct aisle access for all. The seats are Thompson Vantage XL, an incredibly popular, fully-flat business-class seat that's also used by Qantas, Swiss and SAS (see our review of this product on SAS' A330 here). It's also the seat that'll be used in business class on Delta's A350.

The cabin features 20 green-colored seats, each with a sand-colored leather cloth cover and a dark-toned frame and table. The Airbus trim and finish manager worked with design teams from the airline to create an interior onboard the aircraft that was true to the culture, authenticity and 'roots' of Rwanda. The rear walls of each cabin section feature a pattern resembling hills, as Rwanda is famously known as being the ""Land of a Thousand Hills.' In addition to this, the choice for a dark-toned seat frame and shell was designed with the image of a gorilla hugging its baby in mind, since the country is famously known for its mountain gorillas — TPG even got to see some in the wild during his trip there last year.

Single 'A' seats are perfect for solo travelers, especially seats 2A (my seat for this flight) and 4A, which are closest to the windows.

The center seats offer both the correct amount of privacy — great if you're traveling alone — but are sociable enough for couples or friends traveling together.

Each business-class seat is 79 inches in its lie-flat position, has 45 inches of pitch and features in-seat power via an international plug socket as well as a USB port. You'll also have access to a small lamp and a dedicated hook to hang your headphones on.

Typical of this kind of seat, the seatbelt is over-the-shoulder — much like a car seatbelt — and connects with the usual around-the-waist belt to provide extra restraint during takeoff and landing. During turbulence, the over-the-shoulder part of the seatbelt is not necessary, therefore it can be released, meaning passengers have the option to fasten just the usual around-the-waist belt.

Another unique design feature aboard the aircraft was the cabin walls, which feature a pattern, a detail not many airlines include that worked really well on this particular plane. The pattern is known as 'Imigongo,' named for a popular Rwandan art form, and was created especially for RwandAir by the Airbus trim and finish manager. The Rwandan team onboard mentioned how passengers from the country would appreciate such familiar patterns from home. Visually, it not only looked great, but also enhanced the 'Rwandan' feeling in the cabin.

Premium Economy

RwandAir has become the first African airline to offer a premium economy cabin, which on this aircraft is made up of three rows of 21 seats in a 2-3-2 configuration.

With padded seats and 38 inches of pitch, RwandAir's premium economy cabin is going to be one of the most popular on an African airline yet.

The 'Imigongo' lined walls and 'Rwandan Hills' rear cabin wall patterns continued into both premium economy and economy.

Each seat in premium economy featured a footrest.

The green/blue Rwandan-inspired fabric covered most of the seat, which also featured a leather headrest and white cloth cover.

Economy

RwandAir's A330 has 203 economy seats that take up two cabin sections. The seats are upholstered in black leather with green highlights, and laid out in a 2-4-2 configuration, which is one of the perks of the A330 aircraft as it's better for solo travelers, couples and families.

These economy seats look sleek and smart — their velcro is ready for the attachment of an antimacassar (cloth cover) — while each one's pitch comes in at 32 inches.

Economy seats come with in-seat power via an international plug socket and USB connection, as well as a coat hook.

As it's a new aircraft, frequent flyers will notice the 'newer style' seatbelt signs, which no longer feature an illuminated 'no smoking sign' but instead display information regarding when it's safe to use electronic devices. Large screens with on-demand in-flight entertainment are offered to all economy-class passengers.

Overall Impression

RwandAir's A330 has certainly set the bar high for African airline offerings — essentially putting out a better business-class product than Emirates since all its seats have direct aisle access — and is now the first African airline to offer a premium economy cabin, a trend that's becoming more and more popular worldwide.

What I like most is the way the country of Rwanda is reflected throughout all the cabins. RwandAir has used its first wide-body jet as an opportunity to create, with Airbus, a strong brand that's fit for the A330. It's comfortable for passengers and with an ever-expanding route network, I'm excited for the future of RwandAir, the fastest-growing airline in Africa.

Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 Production Increases Are Coming -- Even With Slowing Orders - Fox Business,"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2JvZWluZy03MzctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW5jcmVhc2VzLWFyZS1jb21pbmctZXZlbi13aXRoLXNsb3dpbmctb3JkZXJz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvYm9laW5nLTczNy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1pbmNyZWFzZXMtYXJlLWNvbWluZy1ldmVuLXdpdGgtc2xvd2luZy1vcmRlcnMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Historically, commercial jet orders have been sharply cyclical, with boom times followed by big busts. In the past year or two, order activity has slowed significantly at Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY), indicating that the current cycle is past its peak.

Order activity for the Boeing 737 has slowed in the past two years. Image source: The Motley Fool.

This order slowdown has made many analysts skeptical that Boeing and Airbus will be able to implement planned production increases for their 737 and A320 narrowbody jet families. This isn't a very realistic concern. With unprecedented narrowbody order backlogs, Boeing and Airbus remain well positioned to go ahead with plans to raise production aggressively in the next few years.

Order activity slows, but backlogs remain massive

Between 2011 and 2015, Airbus averaged more than 1,000 net orders per year for its popular A320-series planes. During that period, it was building less than half that number on an annual basis. Order activity declined in 2016, but Airbus still managed to secure more than 600 net orders for the A320 family (including the new A320neo series).

As a result, Airbus ended 2016 with a record backlog of 5,645 A320-family jets. That represents more than 10 years of output at last year's rate.

Boeing had a briefer order peak, with more than 1,000 net orders for the 737 every year from 2012 to 2014. It then added on 588 net orders in 2015 and another 550 in 2016. Even with the 737 falling behind the A320 in the order race lately, Boeing ended last year with an impressive backlog of 4,452 unfilled orders for 737-family jets.

Boeing ended 2016 with a backlog of 4,452 orders for the 737. Image source: Boeing.

Can Airbus and Boeing ramp up production?

In response to strong demand, Airbus and Boeing are in the midst of dramatically increasing narrowbody output. Last year, Airbus increased the A320 production rate from 42 per month to 46 per month. It plans to continue this production growth in the coming years, with output topping out at 60 per month in mid-2019.

Boeing is not far behind. It is currently building 42 737s each month, but plans to boost output in each of the next three years, reaching a production rate of 57 per month sometime in 2019.

If all of these production increases occur as planned, Boeing and Airbus will each be churning out about 675-700 narrowbody jets annually by the end of the decade. Annual order activity has already fallen below this level and could decline further in 2017. Furthermore, some airlines are deferring orders to later years. This doesn't impact the backlog, but it does reduce near-term demand.

Not surprisingly, some analysts see this as a bad time to increase production. AirInsight founder Addison Schonland recently stated that he doesn't expect Boeing and Airbus to go ahead with their planned production increases because the order backlog has already peaked. Furthermore, he thinks that low fuel prices will encourage airlines to defer more orders.

We haven't seen this before

During many previous industry cycles, declining order activity was followed relatively quickly by production cuts. However, aircraft manufacturers rarely had more than three or four years' worth of production in their backlogs until very recently. Furthermore, Boeing and Airbus have more diverse customer bases today than they did even a decade ago.

Aircraft order backlogs are at unprecedented levels right now. Image source: Airbus.

In short, the backlogs for the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 are truly unprecedented in terms of size. Additionally, both manufacturers have liberally overbooked their production capacity, building in flexibility to accommodate order deferrals and cancellations.

The risk of low fuel prices driving massive order deferrals is also overstated. Fuel efficiency is one reason for replacing older airplanes, but it's not the only reason. As airplanes get older, they become more and more expensive to maintain. Reliability also tends to decrease. This limits the extent to which airlines can keep older planes flying in lieu of ordering new jets.

Furthermore, replacement needs represent a relatively small proportion of narrowbody demand right now. For the next five years, Boeing expects an average of about 200 single-aisle airplanes per year to reach the standard retirement age of 25 years. Most of the airplanes on order are needed for growth.

If the world tips into recession, it's possible that numerous airlines could cancel their growth plans, driving a wave of order deferrals and cancellations. That would undermine the case for raising production of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Inside the Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 That Just Launched from Houston - View from the Wing,"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9pbnNpZGUtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWp1c3QtbGF1bmNoZWQtaG91c3Rvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines flew its first Airbus A350 out of Houston last night. Indeed, it was the first A350 in Houston period.

This is the new plane which will become the workhorse of the Singapore Airlines long haul fleet. They’re replacing a large Boeing 777 on the Houston run, and have also changed the city it connects in enroute to Singapore. Houston – Moscow no longer makes sense with low oil prices, so they’re flying Houston – Manchester – Singapore. And with a smaller aircraft they may be able to make the 5 times a week service work.

Most customers will see the Airbus A350 as a huge advance – not only because, like the Boeing 787 it’s a more comfortable ride pressurized to a lower altitude, but because it features Singapore’s newest inflight products.

While the Houston flight previously had one row of first class and now will not offer a first class cabin, Houstonians trade that for a better business and economy product and the addition of premium economy to the route.

Singapore’s premium economy is one of the real hidden gems in travel — not only because it’s an upgrade from coach (with pre-order meal options and champagne) but because it’s an easy upgrade to business and a great value to do so with miles.

Though I’ve been on Boeing 787-8 and 787-9s, I’d never been on an A350 so looked forward to the chance to climb around onboard the aircraft before they boarded the inaugural.

Later this year we’ll see a new business class product and new first class suites on Singapore’s first new delivery Airbus A380. The business class product will be ‘more than an evolution’ on the current offering.

I find Singapore Airlines to offer one of the best business class products. There are two general knocks on it, though. One is that it isn’t super comfortable for lounging because instead of transitioning to a bed (and thus offering myriad options in between upright and bed mode) it flips over to become a bed. The tradeoff of course is a very good bed. The other issue is that to lie fully flat you angle yourself in the seat. I don’t mind this at all, but many do not prefer it.

Regardless, it’s a gorgeous and comfortable product and combined with Singapore’s food and service it’s a great offering. They don’t do amenity kits in business class (though there are plenty of amenities in the lavs) and they don’t do pajamas. But it’s a tradeoff most are more than willing to make.

I do like the soft product in premium economy. There’s one knock on though in my opinion: width. It’s a couple of inches narrower than the American Airlines premium economy seat.

In some sense where they shine though is in the main cabin, there’s no question Singapore offers a top notch business class but their thoughtfulness and attention to detail really shines in coach. Instead of seeing the back of the plane as just a place to cram in seats, they clearly realize that’s where most of their customers are.

Economy seats have foot bars, something that’s reserved for the majority of premium economy seats on American. They have cup holders. Each seat had a pillow and blanket – and both felt substantive. There are little touches that make the experience feel more civilized.

Economy of course isn’t the farthest cabin at the back of the plane, that belongs to crew rest.

Singapore is a premium long haul airline in a region seeing tremendous competition from low cost carriers. Those are a part of Singapore’s strategy as well, with the airline merging its Tiger and Scoot brands under the Scoot portfolio now offering both short and long haul service including a new flight all the way to Athens. (Two years ago Scoot trolled Spirit Airlines for stealing its corporate branding.)

We aren’t going to see Scoot in the U.S. — their 787s can reach Europe and even San Francisco but San Francisco is a more premium market. I’d actually love to see the Tigerair narrowbodies operating domestically, bring some competition to the U.S. market, but the major U.S. airlines will always lobby hard enough to stop that and of course the House Transportation Committee is chaired by Bud Shuster (R-Airlines for America).

After I got off the plane it was time for gate ceremonies, and passengers were treated to a welcome and snacks before boarding.

The cupcakes looked delicious but I had eaten in the Centurion lounge so I gave them a miss."
The Biggest And Best Remote Control Airplanes – The Airbus A400M (Watch) - War History Online,"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhcmhpc3RvcnlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2luc3RhbnQtYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2lnYW50aWMtcmVtb3RlLWNvbnRyb2wtYWlyYnVzLWE0MDBtLWRyb3BzLXBhcmFjaHV0ZXMtYWlybGluZXJ0cmVmZmVuLmh0bWzSAZIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FyaGlzdG9yeW9ubGluZS5jb20vaW5zdGFudC1hcnRpY2xlcy9naWdhbnRpYy1yZW1vdGUtY29udHJvbC1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tZHJvcHMtcGFyYWNodXRlcy1haXJsaW5lcnRyZWZmZW4uaHRtbC9hbXA_cHJlYmlkX2FiPWVuYWJsZWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every two years since 2011, the biggest and best remote control airplanes have been flown at the Airlinertraffen gathering in Oppingen, in Germany. From military models to commercial jetliners, dozens of these remarkable machines hit the skies.

Remote controlled aircraft have been around for some time. They have their roots in the later years of the 19th Century, when the first examples of this technology began to appear. These were electronically guided airships, filled with hydrogen, and they were moved with a spark-emitted radio signal. Towards the end of the 1800’s, these new inventions would fly around the interiors of theaters, as part of a music hall act.

As the 20th Century began and Europe was engulfed in conflict, the concept of aircraft that could be operated from the ground was understandably of interest to military forces in several nations. In 1916, two years into the war, the United States Navy started developing prototypes for an unmanned aerial bomb.

The result of their work proved to be less than effective. It weighed 175 pounds and proved to be very inaccurate when used on specific targets. Funding for these remote controlled aerial devices soon dried up, and the Navy shelved their plans.

However, many years later, a model airplane enthusiast called John Stuart Foster Jr. proposed the idea of remote controlled aircraft for military use. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency approved his designs and by 1973 they had build the basic models. Though relatively crude by today’s standards, they proved to be an essential step towards the modern drones and remote controlled machines we have today.

While many of these devices have become associated with military actions, especially with the advent of drone warfare in the Middle East, the technology is still extremely popular for civilian use. This is demonstrated at events like Oppingen’s Airlinertraffen festival.

A wide variety of demonstrations and displays take place each year at the gathering. In 2015, Hannes Heppe flew a remote control plane he made himself – an Airbus A400M – at this event. The crowd was delighted when he dropped parachutes from the Airbus during its flight.

The real-life Airbus A400 Atlas is a large aircraft that primarily functions in a transportation role, referred to as a tactical air-lifter. However, if equipped with the right tools and resources, they are also capable of providing medical evacuation and aerial refueling.

Heppe’s model has a 12-foot wingspan, weighs 83 lbs, and uses a 6000mAh six-cell battery pack for each of its four motors. Its maximum flight duration is 7 minutes.

The real Airbus A400M was built through a partnership of several countries and continues to be a multi-international plane. It was designed to “transport what the C130 cannot to places that the C17 can’t”, meaning it was required to carry a substantial number of people for long distances but be able to land on soft, short runways.

The project’s conception occurred in the early 1980s, but due to delays, the maiden flight did not happen until 2009. The French Air Force directed the A400M’s first operational flight in December 2013.

Here are the stats on the full-size Airbus A400M:

Cargo and troop transport, medical evacuation

Fly by wire flight control system with sidestick controllers

Flight envelope protection

Full glass cockpit

Hydraulic system with 3000 psi channels

Two electrical systems rather than third hydraulic system

Carbon fiber reinforced plastic wings

Eight blade scimitar propeller

Four Europrop TP400-D6 engines rated at 11,000 hp each turning in opposing directions

Deployable baffles at the front of the rear side doors to protect paratroopers from being hit by the craft before hitting the slipstream

Crew capacity of four

Holds 81,600 lbs including an area for 116 fully equipped troops, 66 stretchers, and 25 medics

148 feet in length with a wingspan of 139 feet

Carries up to 111,000 lbs in internal fuel

Cruising speed: 485 mph

Range: up to 3450 nmi"

The Propulsion Qualification Test Model (PQM) will be used to check that the Orion European Service Module (ESM) spacecraft’s propulsion subsystem functions correctly. On behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA), Airbus Defence and Space is prime contractor for the ESM, a key element of NASA’s next generation Orion spacecraft.

Although the PQM will never see space, this is an important step in the development of the Orion program. Complex systems for human spaceflight must first be tested and qualified on Earth before being used as flight hardware in space. The engineers want to determine how the system behaves in different environments, to ensure that it functions properly.

The test module is travelling via Bremerhaven, Germany and Houston, U.S. to its final destination at NASA’s White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) near Las Cruces in New Mexico, U.S. Arrival is expected mid-February. The tests will take place later in the year at WSTF for the qualification of Orion ESM’s propulsion subsystem."

Photographers capture Airbus A400M at low level through the Mach Loop for First Time - The Aviationist,"Sun, 08 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvMDgvcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVycy1jYXB0dXJlLWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbS1hdC1sb3ctbGV2ZWwtdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtbWFjaC1sb29wLWZvci1maXJzdC10aW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A400M tactical airlifter training low level flying is a pretty cool sight!

Aviation enthusiasts at the famous “Mach Loop” low level training area in West Central Wales on the west coast of UK got a treat early this week when an Airbus A400M Atlas made two low-level passes through the valley area.

It was the first appearance by the A400M in the area also known as the Machynlleth Loop or CAD West. These photos and video were captured at the “CAD East” viewing area across from CAD West.

Many local aviation photographers captured photos and video of the two passes. Among the best were shot by photographer Ben Collins of Llandudno, North Wales, UK.

Collins shot his photos using a Nikon D750 camera with an image-stabilized Sigma 150-600mm f5-6.3 DG OS HSM ‘S’ Sport zoom lens, a popular lens for aviation photographers used widely on the airshow circuit.

His original images were captured as RAW files. Collins is a regular at the famous Mach Loop, visiting the area between two and four times weekly when there is flying weather.

Videographer Paul Williams shot a short YouTube video posted yesterday of the A400M’s transit through the area in perfect viewing conditions.

And here’s a cool video filmed by Ben Ramsey who got a great close-up footage!

The RAF A400M’s are relatively new aircraft in British service, with the first being delivered on November 14, 2014. The service will eventually employ 22 total A400M’s according to the RAF’s official website. The new Airbus A400M’s are staged replacements for the aging fleet of RAF C-130 aircraft.

The aircraft that flew through the Mach Loop today was likely aircraft number ZM411, an A400M-180 manufactured just before Aug. 26, 2016, and delivered to the Royal Air Force on Oct. 28, 2016.

There are three RAF squadrons operating A400M Atlas aircraft now, Squadron Number LXX, the first operational A400M squadron in the RAF that began operations on October 1, 2014. RAF Number XXIV Squadron flies the A400M from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, England. The Number 24 Squadron is the Fixed Wing Air Mobility Operation Conversion Unit and trains Atlas crews for the RAF. Finally the Number 206(R) Squadron fly the A400M as a test and evaluation unit.

The famous Mach Loop is a destination for aviation photographers and spotters from around the world since it provides a unique opportunity to photograph and observe many different aircraft types from several countries in an operational training setting that is very different from an airshow.

*Well, at least they’re trying to. Look forward to Uber Air in the near(ish) future

Yes, it’s the dream we all saw in Back to the Future, The Fifth Element and Blade Runner. No, not a hoverboard, Milla Jovovich or the white stallion from Deckard's nightmares – the flying car. And Airbus wants to make them a ridesharing, autonomous reality. Really. In fact, chief exec of Airbus, Tom Enders, said the aviation company planned to test prototypes by the end of the year.

""One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground,” he said at a tech conference in Germany. “Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground.”

To make it so, three teams across the Airbus Group have taken on the project of delivering a different kind of air travel to what we’re used to with jetliners. In a nutshell, they’re researching and developing ways to beat street-level traffic by using the airspace above it. Or, as one team put it, “define the future of flight.” Onanistic mission statements aside, they’re trying to create a future where you can use your phone to book a cross-town ride in a helicopter-car thingy that flies itself.

Yep, that’s right – to make sure the future of flying cars doesn’t end up in a giant, sky-borne explosion, Airbus wants to use the latest autonomous and AI tech to take personal travel to the skies. The big ideas being bandied about at the moment include a kind of flying bus, where you could use an app to book a seat in an autonomous heli-van. Which sounds like just the thing to get you home after a big night on the town. Another plan revolves around flying autonomous cars with just one or two seats, akin to an airborne chauffeur. Again, it’d be booked via an app, in the grand Uber tradition. Finally, there’s a plan to create an autonomous airborne delivery service, where drones – and the architecture to keep them in the sky and out of hedges, jet engines and pedestrians' faces – would be sold to companies like DHL and Amazon.

The satellite is now undergoing final testing before it is sent to Kourou, French Guiana, for an Ariane 5 launch scheduled in April.

According to a statement released by Airbus, Eutelsat 172B is the first high-power satellite in the 3-ton class. The satellite combines electric power of 13 kW with a launch weight of 3,500 kg. The satellite will host three distinct payloads that will expand Eutelsat’s ability to serve Asia-Pacific markets: a C-band payload, a regular Ku-band payload and a high throughput payload specifically designed for In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) along Pacific air corridors.

Eutelsat 172B is based on the Eurostar E3000 platform from Airbus Defence and Space, in its latest Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) evolution. This version relies exclusively on electric propulsion for initial orbit raising and all on-station maneuvers, while reducing mass which allows the satellite to be launched in the Ariane 5 lower position."

Filling the Middle Of the Market gap - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wMS8xOC9maWxsaW5nLW1pZGRsZS1tYXJrZXQtZ2FwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

January 17, 2017, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus and Boeing had completely different views about the product strategy for the “Middle of the Market” sector (MOM), both for today and the future.

Officials presented their views on how to fill the “Middle of the Market gap” at the Air Finance Journal conference in Dublin.



The Airbus view is: “We got it all covered”.

Boeing’s view is: “Not so fast, there is more to it than meets the eye.”

Airbus and MOM

Airbus’ view was presented by Richard Owen Walker, head of Investor Marketing at Airbus. His presentation showed that “with our A321neo and A330-800, we cover the MOM market.”

From the low end, the A321neo in normal version covers a market of up to 200 seats with a range coverage of 3,000nm. This is enough for transcontinental flights within USA and many other routes on a MOM market.

Should the A321neo not be capable enough, you can go for the 97t A321LR version and your useful range increases with 950nm, Walker said. This covers all the routes flown by Boeing 757 today.

Should the seat capacity or range still not be enough, Walker said there is the A330-800 which, with 230 to 270 seats and up to 7,500nm range, covers the rest of the MOM market.

“We understand that Boeing sees a gap in the market,” Walker said. “There is a gap in the Boeing product offering. Sales of the 737 MAX 9 stands at 220 units, according to the Ascend database. Compare that with 1,400 orders for A321neo.

“At the other end, the 787-8 has stopped selling,” he said. “[The 787] sold 1,200 aircraft since program start in 2003. In the same period, our A330 sold 1,197 aircraft. The 787 was supposed to kill the A330, not sell equal with it.

“So while we don’t see a MOM gap in our offering we can understand if Boeing does,” Walker said.

Boeing and MOM

Boeing’s James Billing, Managing Director Market Analysis, had a different approach. Billing said the MOM work is exciting as it’s the last chance to create a new aircraft for an uncovered segment. If it happens, it’s not going to happen again soon.

He then pointed out that MOM is different. It’s not about adapting something existing to cover the segment in a sub-optimal way. He warned about viewing this market with today’s aircraft and operational ideas. The LCC’s did not happen because they were more of the same.

Billing then showed there is a gap in the Boeing product line. The gap between 737 MAX 9 (178 seats) and 787-8 (271 seats) is around 100 seats, similar to the gap that Airbus has, Figure 1.

He then made several observations around the characteristics of an MOM market:

Upgrade of market:

When a new aircraft would be entering this market, after 2025, the market is not the same. The market will have grown by 100m passengers in Asia alone, Figure 2.

Present aircraft will not be large enough to handle this growth, Billing said.

Fragmentation of market

Billing said a new aircraft specifically made for this segment can fly routes economically that existing aircraft cannot. This will create a new fragmentation of the market. Over the last few years, aircraft with new capabilities opened some 400 new routes that existing aircraft could not do. They did not have the economics.

“Think about what would be possible with an aircraft specifically adapted for the typical MOM routes,” he said. “It would have wide-body capabilities at single aisle economics.”

Replacements

Finally, there is a large replacement market. Up to 40% of the market is replacement of existing aircraft in this category which are less suited for the job, he said.

Summary

“My job is now to talk to operators to understand if 10- to 20-years from now there will be a market sufficiently large to motivate its own aircraft for this segment. Is there a chance to give this segment its own aircraft? We have’n the answer to that yet.”

Iran Air's brand new A321 jet landed at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday on a flight from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Iran Air finalized a deal with the European plane maker in December for 100 planes worth more than $18 billion dollars at list prices.

Iran's flag carrier has separately agreed to buy 80 planes from U.S. manufacturer Boeing.

Most Iranian planes were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts."
Iran Receives 1st Airbus Jet - Financial Tribune,"Sun, 08 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZWNvbm9teS1kb21lc3RpYy1lY29ub215LzU3MTU1L2lyYW4tcmVjZWl2ZXMtMXN0LWFpcmJ1cy1qZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iran Air has taken the delivery of an Airbus A321, which will be the first jetliner to be delivered to Iran from among 100 planes the French planemaker has agreed to supply after the lifting of economic sanctions last year.

The flag carrier’s CEO Farhad Parvaresh said on Sunday an Iran Air team was in Hamburg, Germany, to prepare the plane for its delivery later this week.

“Based on what we know … an Iran Air pilot will land the plane on Thursday,” he was quoted by the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development's news service as saying.

Airbus confirmed Iran Air had received its first new jet.

“The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done,” an Airbus spokesman was quoted as saying by Reuters.

A spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization also said the aircraft has been placed on the country's aircraft register.

""The registration has been done and the delivery should be done by the end of the week,"" Reza Jafarzadeh told Reuters by telephone.

The 189-seat jet was assembled in Hamburg. From there, it is expected to be transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for a formal handover on Wednesday.

Parvaresh said there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the plane in Tehran. He also noted that the plane will be initially used in domestic flights upon delivery.

The Airbus A321 jetliner, painted in Iran Air livery, will be the first plane from a multibillion dollar order Iran secured last month.

The deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice, as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Airbus had said almost half the jets would be for short to medium routes and that deliveries would start early 2017.

Iran had said it expected the delivery of a total of eight Airbus planes, including one A321 narrow-body and two long-range A330s, along with ATR planes by March 20.

The contract Iran signed with Airbus on December 22 includes 46 of the narrow-body A320 family that includes the A321 model, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 of Europe's newest long-range model, the A350.

Such a deal would be worth $18-20 billion at list prices, depending on variants flown, but Iran is expected to receive steep discounts from foreign manufacturers.

The head of Iran Air was quoted as saying earlier that the value of the contract would not exceed $10 billion.

It is expected to be followed by a formal deal to buy 20 turboprop aircraft from ATR, half-owned by Airbus.

> Financing Process Making Headway

Parvaresh said Iran Air will use an Airbus backstop financing for the first six deliveries, but the rest will be financed by third-party international financiers.

So far two financiers, one from a Persian Gulf littoral state and another from China, have offered to finance the planes, he said, without further elaboration.

Industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with global aerospace corporation Dubai Aerospace about financing the purchase.

“We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating.

Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment.

Based on the financing model agreed in the contract, Iran will pay less than 20% of the cost of the planes, and the rest will be covered by financing companies.

Sukuk Sale

Iran Air is also planning to sell $500 million worth of sukuk bonds to cover a portion of what the company should pay in cash to Airbus.

The Airbus contract came days after Iran signed a similar deal with the planemaker's American rival Boeing for 80 jets.

All sides have an interest in moving quickly. The Iranian government wants to show results from the nuclear deal it clinched with the world powers in July 2015, Airbus wants to get deliveries moving and Boeing wants the leverage it can get from European deliveries to Iran.

Despite rivalries, the Airbus and Boeing deals with Iran are unusually intertwined because each depends on continued US clearances for the sale of planes built with US parts.

The ability to renew Iran's aging and accident-prone fleet is widely viewed as a test of the pragmatist policies of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ahead of presidential elections in May.

As it stands, the first Airbus will be delivered before the January 20 inauguration of US president-elect, Donald Trump, who has opposed an international deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.

Although Airbus said the deal was subject to US Treasury export licenses granted in September and November 2016, Republican critics of the nuclear pact want Trump to block the aircraft deals and have sought to hamper them by voting to tighten restrictions on the use of the US financial system."
"Next Stop, Hawaii: Sheldon Adelson Sets Record With 18-hour Flight From Israel - Israel News - Haaretz","Wed, 04 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAxLTA0L3R5LWFydGljbGUvY2FzaW5vLW1vZ3VsLXNoZWxkb24tYWRlbHNvbi1zZXRzLXJlY29yZC13aXRoLTE4LWhvdXItZmxpZ2h0LWZyb20taXNyYWVsLzAwMDAwMTdmLWY1ZDUtZGRkZS1hYmZmLWZkZjU0NWZiMDAwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Seventeen hours and 40 minutes – that's the length, according to estimates, flown by American Jewish billionaire businessman Sheldon Adelson after his departure from Israel on Monday in his private plane to Honolulu, Hawaii. The lengthy journey coincidentally set a record for the longest flight to ever depart from Israel's Ben-Gurion International Airport.

Adelson's Airbus A345 (registration VP-BMS) allows for very long flight times, especially when it's empty of passengers and cargo. With a total range of 15,000 kilometers, the Airbus model is meant to carry as many as 380 passengers and serves the longest commercial route in the world – from Singapore to Newark.

According to various reports, Adelson's plane is personalized to his needs and includes bedrooms with double beds as well as a bottom floor with large bathrooms and showers at passengers' disposal. All the seats that are installed in the plane are on the first-class level, with advanced features.

The Airbus didn't even stop to refuel during the marathon flight, which started by crossing over Europe to the Arctic Ocean, continuing to the North Pole, and then diving south over Alaska in the direction of Honolulu.

Such a long flight requires the presence of multiple air crews on the plane, meaning that besides Adelson and his enterouge, as least three pilots must have been on board. It's unkown if Adelson's wife accompanied her husband on the record-setting flight, but sources say the two commonly arrive at joint destinations on separate flights, seemingly due to differing schedules. Miriam Adelson owns a Boeing 767-300.

Commercial routes that reach such long flight times include an Qantas' flight from Sydney, Australia, to Dallas (nearly 17 hours), and Saudia's 16-hour-and-40-minute journey from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Los Angeles.

This restaurant is made out of an Airbus A320 aircraft - Mashable,"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYWlycGxhbmUtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1oYXdhaS1hZGRhLWx1ZGhpYW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ever fancied a date inside an aircraft? Sparks would fly perhaps.

A New Delhi, India based hospitality company is recreating an experience close to that. Only this time, the aircraft is not flying but on ground.

But that takes nothing away from the uniqueness of Hawai Adda — a swanky airplane restaurant made out of a junk Airbus 320 once flying for Air India. The name literally means 'airport' in Hindi and the ambiance replicates it.

The restaurant, situated in the northern Indian city of Ludhiana, took more than a year to make and opened to the public last month.

""We were inspired by the Maharaja Express [a luxurious food and travel experience inside a train in New Delhi] and wanted to create something similar inside a plane,"" Parampreet Singh Luthra, director of Hands Hospitality and the brain behind the innovative project, tells Mashable India.

But it wasn't easy. ""We wanted to retain most of the original bits of the aircraft including its 1 million wires. So, we had to hire experienced engineers and airline support staff who knew the drill,"" he adds.

The project had reportedly run into trouble in late 2015 for flouting fire safety norms, according to the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation. Another report claimed that the airplane's wings were touching the edges of the Ludhiana- Ferozepur national highway causing a potential traffic hazard and thus, delaying proceedings.

But Luthra denies any such problems. ""We have all the clearances from the government,"" he confirms.

Hawai Adda is a 72-seater restaurant that serves pure vegetarian food. It also has a cafe, a bakery and a kitty hall that can hold up to 40 people. Barring the furniture, all original elements of an airplane have been retained.

And photos posted on its Instagram page reveal a plush set-up.

Hawai Adda has the distinction of being India's first airplane restaurant. And adds to the country's list of unique restaurants from a jail-themed one in Chennai to a cable-car themed one in Bangalore."
Iran Air Celebrates Arrival of New Airbus A321 - AirlineGeeks.com,"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE3LzAxLzEyL2lyYW4tYWlyLWFycml2YWwtYTMyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ News ] By Mateen Kontoravdis

After 24 years without any new airplanes, Iran Air finally received their first of many new aircraft yesterday, an Airbus A321. A ceremony was held at Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse to celebrate this historic day.

Today the aircraft, an A321 (EP-IFA), was flown to Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. A team of Airbus officials including CEO Fabrice Brégier were onboard the delivery flight to attend a celebration in Tehran. The aircraft arrived in Iran’s capital around 3 p.m. local time and was greeted by many aviation enthusiasts, news reporters, and company officials.

In a statement from Airbus, Brégier said: “Today is a momentous occasion and I congratulate Iran Air on taking delivery of it first new aircraft in many years. As we take these first steps together, we stand ready to support the development and modernisation of Iran Air.”

Last year, Iran Air officials met with Airbus to discuss an order for 100 aircraft after sanctions on Iran were lifted, following the Iran Nuclear Deal agreement. The airline’s initial order included the A380 but has since been revised. A firm order was signed in December of 2016 and includes 46 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 38 Airbus A330 family aircraft, and 16 Airbus A350XWBs.

Iran Air’s CEO Farhad Parvaresh stressed the importance of Iran Air receiving new aircraft after revealing that only six years ago they operated 54 aircraft, which has since been reduced to only 23, each having an average age of 23 years.

The airline plans to take delivery of five more A320s and three A330s, two of which Parvaresh hopes to have delivered before Nowruz. In addition to the Airbus deal, Iran Air has reached an agreement for 80 Boeing aircraft and 20 ATR aircraft.

Over 200 new airplanes will be added to the airline’s fleet within the next few years. These deliveries will continue to help Iran Air grow, add more destinations, and compete with the other larger carriers in the region.

H160 completes cold weather trials - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvaDE2MC1jb21wbGV0ZXMtY29sZC13ZWF0aGVyLXRyaWFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus H160 has completed its cold weather test program in northern Canada, as the aircraft continues its journey towards certification in late 2018 or early 2019.

The 5.5- to 6-tonne twin-engine aircraft, unveiled at HAI Heli-Expo in March 2015, is powered by the 1,200-horsepower Safran Arrano, and features a number of innovations, including a fully composite airframe, Airbus’s proprietary Blue Edge rotor blades, electrical landing gear, a new canted Fenestron tail rotor, and a biplane horizontal stabilizer.

The H160 was ferry flown to the cold weather testing site in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, in December 2016, and began flight trials in the first week of January.

Bernard Fujarski, head of the H160 program, said the team was looking to expose the aircraft to temperatures as low as -40 C during the tests.

“They are looking especially to assess the dynamic behavior of the aircraft, the performance in cold weather, and we are interested in performing several cold soaks and then starting the aircraft to see how the systems are working,” he told Vertical.

While he wouldn’t share specifics in terms of the aircraft’s performance, he did say that the feedback from the flight team has been positive, and that the aircraft’s systems are behaving as predicted.

Prior to travelling to Yellowknife, Airbus took the H160 to a climate chamber in Vienna, Austria, to complete some low and high temperature tests.

“It was an excellent dry run for the campaign,” he said. “We had to make some little adjustments — not too much — and so far the results are according to our expectations. Especially the behavior of the engine is extremely good.”

Airbus is planning to invite representatives from various airworthiness authorities, including the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Transport Canada, and the Federal Aviation Agency, to visit the aircraft in Yellowknife in mid-February.

Also joining the Airbus crew of one pilot, two flight engineers, and five mechanics on location are representatives from its customer support division — speaking to the manufacturer’s aim to launch the H160 with a high level of maturity in both performance and support.

“We started the program with a dedicated team performing concurrent engineering — at the same time we are developing the product, the industry [manufacturing], and the maintenance of the aircraft,” he said. “So we’re using the [Yellowknife] campaign to also check what we are developing regarding the maintenance — the maintainability, the tooling, the procedures, the accessibility — in cold temperatures,” he said.

Program Progression

By the end of 2016, the H160 program had accumulated more than 300 flight hours between its two flying prototypes — PT1 and PT2. The team had also completed the equivalent of 150 flight hours on its “Dynamic Helicopter Zero.” Containing the aircraft’s engines, transmission, rotors and tail boom, the platform is used for dynamic and power checks.

In July, the program passed a key milestone with the freezing of the aerodynamic configuration of the H160’s dynamics assemblies, and the completion of load valuation flights.

“We’ve now got everything in our hands in order to design the serial parts,” said Fujarski, adding that the helicopter was still to perform fatigue tests to determine the life limit of mechanical parts.

Progress has also been good on the manufacturing model to build the H160, with assembly beginning on the first station of the assembly line. For the serial aircraft, Airbus will use a “major component assembly” model, whereby separate modules (including tail boom, central and front fuselage, cockpit avionics bay, main dynamic components, and blades) are fully built and tested in parallel at various Airbus facilities around Europe, and then shipped to the H160’s final assembly line (FAL) in Marignane, France.

“Our industrial model is validated with work-share between the sites of the [Airbus] group in Germany, Spain and France,” said Fujarski. “We’ve also started the maturity checks regarding the industry — for instance, we have already used the manufacturing [system] to assemble the third prototype in order to check that the industrial process is well defined, and adjust what needs to be adjusted.”

The third prototype (PT3) is now in final assembly, but is not due to fly until mid-year. This is because Airbus needs to validate the modifications it has implemented in PT3 from the previous prototypes.

According to Fujarski, the major changes were related with the relocation of avionics and some electrical equipment from the rear to the front in order to optimize the aircraft’s center of gravity, while the air intakes and cowlings have also been reshaped, and a final main rotor mast length has been chosen.

“PT3 is in what we call Standard One configuration, whereas PT1 and PT2 were built according to Standard Zero configuration,” he said. “We are now working on Standard Two, which will be the standard certified and delivered on the first helicopter.”

The H160 has already been assessed by a number of potential customers, with 15 pilots having the opportunity to fly the aircraft in September and December last year.

“So far the feedback was extremely good regarding the vibration level of the aircraft, the external and internal sound ¾ which is extremely low, the visibility from the cockpit, and more generally speaking the maturity of the aircraft at that stage of the program,” said Fujarski.

The manufacturer began taking letters of intent for the H160 in March at Heli-Expo last year, but has not disclosed the total it has received so far. It plans to turn these into firm orders once it has firmed up performance and pricing later this year.

Fujarski said they will be speaking with potential launch customers about the manufacturer’s commitment regarding the H160’s performance, delivery date, configurations, and commercial conditions in the coming weeks. He said this information will be publicly disclosed by mid-year.

In terms of the flight test campaign, one important outstanding element is to test the indirect effect of lightning, which will be done on PT3. The program will then begin certification tests and flights with the regulatory authorities."
Are Duplex First Class Suites next for the Airbus A380? - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvYXJlLWR1cGxleC1maXJzdC1jbGFzcy1zdWl0ZXMtbmV4dC1mb3ItdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Smile. 2017 might not be so bad after all, what with the promise of at least three major debuts of fresh premium seats: Singapore Airlines Suites, Emirates First, and Qatar Airways Business Class. Although no renderings have yet been leaked, it’s fun to wonder what surprises the airlines have in store now that it’s been three years since the 2014 debut of the sliding French doors, private shower room, and separate bedroom of Etihad’s A380 Residence. What’s next? What else can possibly be done to further stretch luxury and exclusivity?

Maybe it’s time for the bi-level suite.

Before I’m bombarded with explanations of why this would never work, let’s remember that airlines famously look to yacht design for inspiration, and luxury yachts have been installing double-decker cabins for years. For example, the 2001 build S/Y Silencio and 2011 build M/Y Tuppence both have bi-level master cabins. Meanwhile, the $1 billion-dollar Admiral XForce concept mega-yacht, reported to be the most expensive yacht ever built (if it does get built), proposes multi-level space for everywhere from its living areas to its indoor pool/spa and pop-down verandahs.

Looking at cruise ships, the duplex trend is already in full force. No fewer than five suite categories onboard Royal Caribbean’s Oasis of the Seas are split-level “lofts,” and the line’s newest ship and current world record holder for largest, Harmony of the Seas (a ship I’ve previously called the “A380 of the ocean”) entered 2016 by showing off an entire deck given over to more than 30 duplex suites, complete with a dedicated private restaurant and lounge.

The upper deck has always been a literal ascension to an elevated experience.

Pan Am’s 747s famously utilized theirs as cocktail lounges; Philippines Airlines once outfitted their jumbos with “Cloud Nine” cabins and some of the first fully flat onboard beds in a jetliner; and other airlines like Korean Air and Etihad reserve their entire A380 second level for premium seats only.

It’s no surprise then that rumors have Singapore Airlines considering a shift of their “Suites” from the lower deck of the A380 to the upper, once the newest iteration of the seat is unveiled in the second half of this year.

If a bi-level suite concept within a commercial airliner does emerge in the near future, it wouldn’t be the first time. One of the original sketches for the Etihad Residence – as imagined by Factorydesign and designed together with Acumen as part of the Etihad Design Consortium (EDC) – focused on spreading the suite across both levels of the Airbus A380. A bedroom sat upstairs, with a private stairwell leading down to the living room. It didn’t fly (pun intended), but the sketch alone proves that the seeds for split-level suites are growing in the minds of aircraft interior designers. For now, at least, travelers will just have to settle for selfies on the A380 stairs.

The Perks Of Corporate Life: Richard Mille RM 50-02 Airbus ACJ Tourbillon Split-Seconds Chronograph - Quill & Pad,"Sun, 08 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vcXVpbGxhbmRwYWQuY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvMDgvcGVya3MtY29ycG9yYXRlLWxpZmUtcmljaGFyZC1taWxsZS1ybS01MC0wMi1haXJidXMtYWNqLXRvdXJiaWxsb24tc3BsaXQtc2Vjb25kcy1jaHJvbm9ncmFwaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have you ever wanted to know what it’s like living the lifestyle of the rich and famous?

You might find yourself flying around on private jets to exotic locales, being chauffeured in a luxurious Bentley to your villa in southern Spain where you relax in your infinity pool and dine on the finest roast beast while sipping a nice vintage Bordeaux from, say, 1961.

That type of life is a dream to many, and one glamorized throughout television history by the likes of Robin Leach and MTV’s “Cribs.” These days, you can go straight to the source and follow the rich and famous vicariously on Instagram and Snapchat, seeing behind the scenes of their lives (or the staged representations of what they portray their lives to be).

One thing is for sure, it’s a glamorous world at the top.

Sometimes, though, nothing can hold a candle to the corporate world, where deals are regularly made for billions of dollars. This environment has special demands for communication and travel, which resulted in a special branch of aerospace company Airbus opening to cater especially to those types of clients. Called Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ), it provides some of the most luxurious and capable jets to corporations, VIPs, and government agencies.

So perhaps it’s unsurprising that Richard Mille, a company catering to similarly well-heeled clients as Airbus, decided a collaboration might work. The result is a truly high-end piece of horology intended to go hand in hand with a new Airbus Corporate Jet. Designed in collaboration with the head of ACJ’s Creative Design Studio, Sylvain Mariat, the RM 50-02 ACJ was born.

Connections

You wouldn’t be the first to think this collaboration seems a little out of left field. But when you manufacture and sell products to a customer base where a million dollars is less than can be made in a fiscal quarter, partnerships become as much about lifestyle as technology.

Airbus creates world-class aircraft using the most advanced engineering and material science available, perhaps just behind NASA. Richard Mille creates watches that are lighter than a feather but unbelievably tough with tourbillons that have been worn during tennis matches, golf tournaments, sailing regattas, and Olympic events. Needless to say, both companies make some pretty awesome things.

This means that there is a shared passion for creating amazing machines and then styling said machines to fit a lifestyle.

The RM 50-02 ACJ is a representation of an Airbus jet for the wrist, but not in the way someone like MB&F might go about it. Instead, it uses details to allude to the jets in a way that many of the automotive-themed watches could learn a thing or two from.

The design of the watch features tie-ins to cockpit controls and gauges, fuselage and window details, weight optimization designs, aerospace coatings, and even tamper-resistant fasteners. It is a pretty complex collaborative effort.

Details



Corporate partnerships aside, what we are really here for is the watch.

The design is clearly based on an Airbus fuselage and window as the bezel is a clean white ceramic pierced by a dozen tamper-resistant Torq-Set® Offset Cruciform Drive screws (we’ll come back to those).

The window-shaped sapphire crystal opens onto a colorful, complicated, and frantic dial. Perhaps a pilot would feel right at home gazing into the cockpit-inspired indications, but for us civilians the dial is a bit more difficult to read. The movement is extremely skeletonized and, given its complexity, does not provide a coherent background for the information displayed.

The dial displays hours, minutes, split-seconds chronograph, running seconds, power reserve, torque indicator (showing the optimal state of tension for the mainspring), and a function indicator.

There are five main accent colors in use for the indications splashed around the dial in different ways. And then there is a sixth main color underneath on the coated bridges. These bridges, also found across the rear of the movement, are glazed with a specific aerospace coating used to reduce corrosion and friction on turbine blades.

The coating is similar (if not exactly the same) as a PVD titanium nitride, which is found in many places on an aircraft.

Even though the dial is hard to read, I find myself not really caring. If we are honest, at the cool price of $1.05 million, I can afford not to care, because I can’t afford to play.

Instead, I find myself enamored with the details throughout the piece. Moving out from the dial we come back to the Torq-Set® Offset Cruciform Drive screws holding the bezel to the case band. These screws are a high-torque derivation of classic Phillips screws used in many military and aerospace applications where precise high torque is needed, including on many Airbus components.

This type of intersection with Airbus components brings us to the case band. The pushers for the split-seconds chronograph are on either side along with the crown on the right.

The pushers and surrounding details are shaped as if they were crucial structural components somewhere on an aircraft, where every part that is possible to make lighter is lightened – usually following protocols for structure and strength.

Triangular ribs are a common sight on structural pieces, and this watch’s pushers and other details follow this path to create an implied framework holding the watch together while remaining as strong and light as possible.

Adding lightness is something that Airbus and Richard Mille actively work on with every watch and every aircraft.

Shape gives way to function

The crown is yet another place where aerospace feels at play as it looks like what would happen if a landing gear wheel and a jet engine had a lovechild. Appropriately, it features the Airbus logo machined into the end. Oh, Little Junior!

But after all of these varied details, the best part is yet to come.

I am a person that values function over form in most cases, so the rear of the RM 50-02 ACJ is where the true magic resides and pure horology comes swinging back into play. The RM 50-02 tourbillon split-seconds chronograph movement is fantastical.

If the rest of the watch wasn’t what it was, this would be the star of the show to any observer, not just to horology nuts like me. But still, the back is where I spent most of my time, slowly tracing the split-seconds chronograph mechanisms around the window.

Without a doubt, this is one of the best executions of a skeletonized chronograph movement I have ever seen. It is futuristic in its design and finishing, yet wholly classic in its mechanical construction. Everything is clear and straightforward while also looking like a sci-fi implementation of something from the turn of the century (but which century?).

The most startling aspect of the design is the extreme skeletonization of the split-second wheels, mirrored by the arms and bridges of the mechanism smattered around the movement. The tourbillon bridges are a work of aerospace art as well, and yet the tourbillon itself seems treated more like a normal run-of-the-mill component than the highly prized and glorified mechanism many watches like to emphasize.

I think this is a conscious decision to keep the focus not on one “whirligig” in the center of the dial, but on every detail that the eye can behold all at the same time.

Feelings

And that is, I believe, what makes Richard Mille perpetually popular: its watches are spectacle and wonder. It does a lot of what other brands do horologically, and the way it does it rivals anybody out there, but the spectacle created by Richard Mille watches, and standout pieces like this, is what separates Richard Mille from the pack.

This watch may be ungodly expensive, but it is also inhumanly cool, to the point that I don’t know if anyone really can pull it off. It is like wearing an Airbus jet on the wrist, it’s just too much awesome.

The technology, engineering, and effort that goes into building an Airbus aircraft is immense. As someone who has seen inside that industry and prototyped products meant for the skies, I sometimes stand in awe that things like jumbo jets ever even get built.

And the RM 50-02 ACJ is a little version of that. There is so much going on with it on the case, the dial, and of course the movement that it seems incredible that it even exists.

The movement alone is worthy of praise and admiration, but the whole package shakes my notions of what an aerospace-inspired watch can actually be. It is a bold piece for sure, and definitely not for everyone’s taste.

Heck, most of the watches were made to be offered to the people actually buying the planes from Airbus, clearly a purchase that most can never even imagine writing a check for.

But for the rest of us, I think we can agree this watch is impressive, and as collaborations go, a well-considered and executed idea. The details are what make up the RM 50-02 ACJ, but the whole ends up being bigger and better than one could have guessed.

And then: the breakdown!

Wowza Factor * 9.65 Seeing a watch designed after a jetliner is a pretty big wow, but seeing the movement is what captured me!

Could these new planes be the end of jet lag? - USA TODAY,"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvY29sdW1uaXN0L2hvYmljYS8yMDE3LzAxLzE4L2pldC1sYWctYWx0aXR1ZGUtc2lja25lc3MtZGVoeWRyYXRpb24vOTY2Nzc1NjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Could these new planes be the end of jet lag?

Show Caption Hide Caption Say goodbye to jet-lag, this new plane will help beat it The Airbus A350 XWB has some features that its designers say should help people battle jet-lag. Patrick Jones (@Patrick_E_Jones) explains. Buzz60

Even though air travel is safer than ever and in many cases cheaper than 10 or 20 years ago, travelers love to complain about its agonies. Cramped and narrow seats, crying babies, chatty seat mates and armrest wars are common gripes. But other factors contribute much more to feelings of distress, especially on longer flights.

The silent killers are altitude sickness and dehydration. These come on you gradually, and most people don’t even know what hit them, blaming their discomfort on “jet lag.”

But help is on the way in the form of new commercial airliners constructed in large part of high-tech materials, including carbon-reinforced plastics.

The science behind air travel discomfort

In a study entitled “Effect of Aircraft-Cabin Altitude on Passenger Discomfort” in the New England Journal of Medicine, the authors write that people who “travel to terrestrial altitudes above 6,500 feet experience acute mountain sickness, a syndrome characterized by symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, lassitude, and sleep disturbance.” The researchers call this “Acute Mountain Syndrome.” The ill effects are even more pronounced the older you are.

And no wonder. When you’re flying at 38,000 feet on a conventional aircraft, the cabin is pressurized at 8,000 feet, the equivalent altitude as Bogota, Colombia, or the Beaver Creek ski resort in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.

But two newer airplane models, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350, are pressurized to 6,000 feet, which makes a huge difference in passenger comfort, as I discovered on some recent flights.

Not long ago I flew from San Jose, Calif., to London non-stop on a British Airways 787-9 (a larger version of the original 787-8) on a 10-hour flight. Soon after I had an opportunity to fly on an even longer leg from the Airbus factory in Toulouse, France, to Singapore, on a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 delivery flight (it just happened to be Airbus’ 10,000 airframe). Breathing problems? No. Dry eyes and nasal passages? Didn’t happen. On both flights, after the meal service I fell into a deep sleep and only woke minutes before landing, feeling incredibly refreshed.

After returning from Singapore, I wanted a deeper understanding of the technology behind these new planes. Exactly how do these aircraft manage to create a more comfortable cabin environment, and why didn’t earlier models achieve these benefits? So I called Boeing to find out, and the company put me in touch with Blake Emery, Director, Differentiation Strategy, and Kent Craver, Regional Director, Cabin Experience and Revenue Analysis.

The answer? Plastics. More specifically, carbon-reinforced plastic composites.

'Pressure drop oh pressure drop. You gonna feel it'

Flying at an “internal altitude” of 8,000 feet means your heart and lungs must work harder to supply oxygen to your vital organs than at sea level, causing fatigue and shortness of breath. It’s one reason why champion marathon runners hail from high-altitude locales: Their stronger lungs and hearts give them an advantage. Not just running, but even sleeping at higher altitude becomes more difficult (have you ever experienced, on a ski trip, waking up in the middle of the night gasping for breath?).

As your high school physics teacher may have explained, air flows from high pressure to low pressure, and atmospheric pressure goes down as altitude increases.

As a plane climbs to 35,000 feet and the pressure outside the plane goes down, the pressure inside the plane, set at a more comfortable lower altitude, becomes higher relative to the outside. So the higher cabin air pressure pushes out trying to equalize with the lower outside pressure.

When airplane designers further increase the interior pressure to achieve a lower and more comfortable cabin altitude, as with the 787, that puts even more stress on the plane’s structure. If that structure is made of metal, the continual bending and flexing of the metal weakens it. “Imagine bending a wire over and over until it breaks,” Craver explains. “It’s the same with aircraft metal.""

“Over time, that increased pressure difference adds stress to a metal airframe, which can shorten the life of the structure,” Craver explains. “While this is not a safety issue, it would certainly be an economic issue for an airline.” But plastic, and the way Boeing constructs its airplanes, means the airplane does not fatigue if you add pressure.

More humidity means more comfort, up to a point

Next, humidity. I had wondered how these new planes managed to maintain higher cabin humidity levels. (I even asked an airline engineer I was flying with to explain this but he couldn’t come up with an answer.) Are there humidifiers on board? No. It’s us. We passengers generate cabin humidity as we breathe and perspire. To reduce aridity, the 787 and A350 retain inside the cabin more of the humidity generated by passengers. They do this by regulating how much humidity is expelled outside the plane.

In fact, the crew can program the Boeing 787’s optimal humidity levels depending on the number of passengers onboard (the more passengers, the more cabin air is expelled). “The outside air at 35,000 feet has near zero humidity,” Emery explained, “But too much humidity inside the cabin is as bad as too little. Think how tired you feel when the humidity is at 100% on a hot day.”

Why don’t older planes keep more human-produced humidity inside the plane, you ask? According to Boeing’s Craver, “humidity can be detrimental. Metal corrodes,” eventually weakening aircraft structures and requiring repairs. “But carbon fiber doesn’t care if it gets wet.”

The 787 offers some other interesting features to increase passenger comfort. Larger windows, higher cabin ceilings, an advanced air filtration system, and software designed to suppress wind gusts to ensure a smoother ride. “It’s not just one item, it’s all of them together as a system,” Carver explained.

Eventually all planes will offer the same benefits, but it’ll take a couple of decades. There are 810 firm orders for the A350 (Singapore Airlines alone has 67 on order) and over 1,200 for the 787. Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines recently began non-stop 16-hour flights between San Francisco and Singapore using A350 jets and in 2018 will be flying 18 hours non-stop from L.A. and New York to Singapore using a longer-range A350 variant.

Although sitting in an airplane for 18 hours is not “fun” for most people (I know, I’ve done it), it’ll be a lot less taxing in one of these new jets.

Anyone wishing to arrive in better shape will do themselves a favor by doing a little research while booking airfares. To find out which routes the 787 and A350 fly, here are two useful websites:

On January 24, the Malaysian low-cost carrier announced that it has been granted certification from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly into the US.

According to the airline, AirAsia X is the first Asian low-cost carrier to secure authorization to operate scheduled service into the US.

""This is a major milestone for AirAsia X,"" AirAsia X Group CEO Datuk Kamarudin Meranun said in a statement. ""Our expansion up until now has concentrated on Asia, Australasia and the Middle East, and we are excited about our first foray into an entirely new market as we look beyond Asia Pacific.""

As a sister airline to low-cost giant AirAsia, AirAsia X is tasked with delivering affordable long-haul international flights using its fleet of Airbus A330 aircraft. Both brands are part of Tony Fernandes' Tune Group.

""AirAsia X is currently considering flights to several US states including Hawaii as part of its route expansion plans,"" the airline said in a statement. However, AirAsia X has not gone into detail as to when it will arrive in the US and which markets it will enter first.

The CAPA Center for Aviation believes AirAsia X's first routes to the US will be from its base in Japan to Hawaii as well as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. An ultra-long haul route using from Malaysia to the US is also a possibility, CAPA reported.

This isn't AirAsia X's first foray outside of Asia. In 2009, AirAsia X launched service from its base in Kuala Lumpur to London before shuttering the route due to high fuels prices in 2012. According to the CAPA, AirAsia X is considering relaunching the London route in 2017 using leased Airbus A350 or Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

With its arrival, AirAsia X will join Norwegian Air and Iceland's WOW Air as a new wave of low-cost long-haul airlines to reach the US market.

In 2016, AirAsia X was named by respected consumer aviation website Skytrax as the sixth best low-cost airline in the world. In addition, AirAsia X took home the Skytrax awards for World's Best Low Cost Airline Premium Cabin and World's Best Low Cost Airline Premium Seat. At the same time, AirAsia was named the best low-cost airline in the world for the eighth consecutive year."

At one of the world’s key hub airports, the A380 is enabling airlines to effectively attract passengers while managing their precious takeoff/landing slots in an increasingly congested operational environment.According to 2016 figures released by London’s Heathrow Airport, 10 per cent of all passengers who travelled through the facility last year arrived or departed on an A380. This equates to more than seven million passengers, and represents an increase from eight per cent in 2015 and six per cent in 2014.The A380 is omnipresent at Heathrow, with the jetliner utilised in service to and from the airport by British Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. These aircraft fly to 14 destinations from the London-area facility, including Los Angeles, Singapore and Dubai.“As air traffic doubles every 15 years, and 90 per cent of long-haul passengers are travelling through 55 hub cities around the world, the A380 is the best aircraft to capture peak demand, while also relieving airport congestion and boosting hub operations,” explained John Leahy, the Chief Operating Officer – Customers, at Airbus Commercial Aircraft.Leahy added that the A380 passenger volume at Heathrow is expected to reach 12 per cent in 2017, and growth in traveller numbers flying on A380s is anticipated at other hub airports such as Los Angeles International, New York/JFK, Hong Kong and Singapore.He noted that with more than 200 aircraft delivered to date, an A380 takes off or lands somewhere in the world every two and a half minutes.To see where the A380 is being used, and book travel on operating airlines, visit the I Fly A380 website: www.iflya380.com"
