Dutch boy sole survivor of Airbus crash in Libya - The Denver Post,"Wed, 12 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTAvMDUvMTIvZHV0Y2gtYm95LXNvbGUtc3Vydml2b3Itb2YtYWlyYnVzLWNyYXNoLWluLWxpYnlhL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTAvMDUvMTIvZHV0Y2gtYm95LXNvbGUtc3Vydml2b3Itb2YtYWlyYnVzLWNyYXNoLWluLWxpYnlhL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CAIRO — A Dutch boy was believed to be the sole survivor Wednesday after a passenger jet bound from South Africa crashed with 104 people aboard while attempting to land in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, according to Libyan and Dutch officials.

The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330 was making a final approach to Tripoli International Airport about 6:10 a.m. on a flight from Johannesburg that was scheduled to continue on to Gatwick Airport in London. The Royal Dutch Tourism Board said 61 of the victims were with two tour groups from the Netherlands.

Libya’s Transport Minister Mohammed Zidan said a 10-year-old boy with a Dutch passport was from taken from the crash site.

“The child is in good condition and is in the hospital undergoing checks,” the minister said at a news conference at the airport. The boy reportedly underwent surgery for breaks in both legs and other injuries.

Terrorism ruled out

The cause of the crash, which occurred under a clear sky, is under investigation. Libyan officials quickly ruled out the possibility of terrorism.

The plane’s manufacturer, the France-based Airbus, said in a statement that “preliminary reports indicate that the aircraft crashed short of the runway threshold during approach.”

Authorities said the plane’s voice and data recorders had been found amid the shattered fuselage and scattered debris, luggage and clothing.

The jet was carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew. Ninety-six bodies had been recovered. Other victims were from Britain, South Africa and Libya.

Investigators from Airbus and France’s Bureau of Investigations and Analyses arrived in Tripoli to assist Libyan authorities. The European Aviation Safety Agency said three recent safety checks found the plane had no serious problems.

Airbus assisting probe

Afriqiyah Airways, which bills itself as a link between Africa and Europe, undergoes frequent inspections. The nationally owned Libyan airline was founded in 2001 and flies a fleet of 11 planes, all Airbus models.

“Airbus will provide full technical assistance to the authorities responsible for the investigation into the accident,” an Airbus statement said. “The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families.”

The Flight 771 tragedy marks the second crash of an Airbus 330 in less than a year. On May 31, an Air France plane bound from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing 228.

On Wednesday, Libyan TV showed rescue workers fanning over a clay-colored field strewn with splintered trees, airline seats and the plane’s broken tail section. Other video showed the injured boy lying in a hospital bed.

Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said the Dutch were in shock over losing so many of their countrymen: “This is a large group of Dutch nationals . . . so it’s a deeply sad message we have this day.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992485642433167}",neutral,0.9992485642433167,0
Airbus aims to 'keep it simple' with A320 NEO - Flightglobal,"Wed, 12 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtdG8ta2VlcC1pdC1zaW1wbGUtd2l0aC1hMzIwLW5lby85MzQ4MC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to avoid any temptation to add complexity to its proposed ""A320 new engine option (NEO)"" upgrade to ensure it will achieve its 2015 service-entry target. However, it looks unlikely that a launch decision for the re-engined derivative will be made until the end of the year.

Airbus is in talks with CFM International and Pratt & Whitney about offering their advanced turbofans, the Leap X and geared turbofan, respectively, on the A320.

It does not envisage any all-new single-aisle being viable before 2025, and the airframer's executive vice-president programmes Tom Williams believes that if Boeing was to make such an aircraft available by the end of this decade it would be obsolete in less than 10 years, when breakthrough technologies such as open rotors mature.

But despite hints from Seattle that such a move is being considered, Williams is determined not to let this influence the definition of the A320 NEO, which is envisaged as being little more than a re-engined version of the current aircraft.

""I want to avoid being sucked into the A350 scenario again, which started out as an A330 re-engining,"" he said at the Airbus Innovations Days event at its Broughton, UK plant, which was held on 10-11 May. ""Airbus needs to be disciplined and not to have scope creep"" with the A320 NEO, he added.

Williams believes that Airbus and the engine makers have a ""window of opportunity to exploit"" with the A320 NEO, and moves to complicate the offering could cause the planned 2015 in-service date to slip and therefore jeopardise the business case for the aircraft.

Williams estimates that an all-new single-aisle would cost $10 billion to develop, around four times that estimated for an upgrade programme such as the A320 NEO.

With Airbus still scrutinising the business case study into the NEO, both Williams and Airbus's chief salesman John Leahy played down earlier talk that the decision to launch could come by as early as the Farnborough air show in July. ""We'll launch it when we're ready,"" says Williams, with the target to make a decision by year-end.

Airbus has been examining the structural changes necessary to accommodate the installation of new engines, but its aim is to keep these to a minimum. Williams says that the new engines are potentially ""600-800lb [270-370kg] heavier"" than today's CFM56 and International Aero Engines V2500 powerplants. Their higher thrust and bigger inlets would also ""give us some issues aerodynamically - wing bend and twist etc"".

This will mean the outer wing will need reinforcing, but Williams says the hope is that Airbus ""won't have to do too much to the centre wingbox"".

Although Airbus aims to continue to offer the current engines in parallel with the NEO, Williams says that ideally production would be standardised around the heavier, reinforced wing as this is ""the simplest and preferred option from an industrial standpoint"".

The first official image released by Airbus of the A320 NEO reveals that the wingtips will incorporate the new ""sharklet"" winglet design, as expected.

Despite the new engines' higher thrust, Williams says that studies indicate that it would be unlikely there would be any need to enlarge the fin or tailplane to compensate for engine-out operations.

Another area that will need attention is the landing gear and Williams says that while studies into the sizing are ongoing, the aim is to ""avoid a significant change"".

No significant material changes are envisaged to save weight, says Williams, although Airbus may ""take advantage"" of new aluminium alloys that have been used in the A380.

Williams says that while from a technical perspective the GTF might be the better option as it fan-drive gearbox layout makes it more obvious where its performance gains come from, he sees the commercial argument as less strong because of P&W's weak position in the small-engine market. ""Up to now they've accessed that market through IAE. We'd like them to keep the IAE relationship but for the moment the partners can't find a way to do that,"" he says.

However, Williams says that if agreement cannot be reached by the IAE partners, then Airbus ""would countenance doing a separate deal with P&W"", for its GTF.

P&W's IAE partner Rolls-Royce is not in the running as prospective supplier for the A320 NEO, says Williams. ""We don't think they've got a solution that works for re-engining. We've had a lot of discussions but none of their ideas work for a re-engining programme from a technical or commercial point of view.""

"Re-engine, new or do nothing? - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 19 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMC8wNS8xOS9yZS1lbmdpbmUtbmV3LW9yLWRvLW5vdGhpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A second aerospace analyst has weighed in with the opinion that Boeing is likely to choose a replacement for the 737 rather than a re-engine solution.

Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley published this note today, as Boeing’s investors’ day begins.

The bottom line – Another New Plane Ahead – BA’s Going To Do A New Single Aisle: We believe Boeing will be announcing a new narrowbody replacement to the well-worn and highly popular 737 instead of the less costly, but inferior solution of re-engining.

This means a $13B-type R&D effort ahead in lieu of a possible $2-3B R&D for re-engining, which was previously in our model. We are now lowering outyear estimates to reflect a projected new narrowbody 2012 launch and 2017-2018 entry into service (EIS, first delivery). We believe consensus earningsexpectations will be revised down significantly on higher R&D.

Why An All New Plane? We expect Airbus to announce an A320 re-engining sometime before yearend; BA will likely announce its plans around the same time. It is not generally known, but on a re-engine to re-engine equivalent basis, we believe the Airbus A320 ends up w/ a 8-10% better fuel burn than the 737, rendering the $3B R&D cost to re-engine largely ineffective. The 737 has been refreshed three times already since its first inception in 1967. And with 5 low end single aisle competitors ~mid-decade, we think BA is prudent to be pre-emptive with an all-new airplane.

Joe Nadol of JP Morgan and Joe Campbell disagree, thinking a re-engine is more likely.

So does Boeing rival Airbus, where COO-Customers John Leahy suggests all the talk about a replacement 737 is Boeing disinformation aimed at muddying Airbus’ waters.

Leahy believes Boeing would be foolish to proceed with a new airplane with a 2019-20 EIS (that predicted by Buckingham Research; Wood predicts 2017-2018, which we think is perhaps a year or two two soon), only to be followed by an all-new, much more efficient A320 replacement in the 2025-27 period.

Airbus is betting that the Open Rotor engine will be the solution rather than the PW GTF or CFM Leap-X engines, which are being considered for re-engine solutions.

At the Airbus Innovation Days, Leahy displayed several charts that showed fuel burn improvement and residual value data to make his case for a re-engine program.

There is concern over the impact of a new, derivative airplane on residual values. Leahy pointed to the transition from the Boeing 737 Classic to the 737 New Generation as the example why RVs won’t plummet with the introduction of a New Engine Option.

The following chart further supports Leahy’s contention that current generation values won’t plunge with an A320 NEO offering.

Finally, Leahy displayed this chart concerning the prospect of a 737 NEO.

Bombardier believes it will still have advantages with its CSeries over either an Airbus or a Boeing NEO. These charts are from their ISTAT presentation.

Latest undersea search fails to turn up Airbus black box - FRANCE 24 English,"Tue, 25 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMDUyNS1sYXRlc3QtdW5kZXJzZWEtc2VhcmNoLWZhaWxzLXR1cm4tYWlyYnVzLWJsYWNrLWJveC1hZjQ0N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AF 447 CRASH

Investigators have again failed to find the black boxes from an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic near Brazil last year, killing all 228 people on board. They do not yet know if they will continue the search.

Advertising Read more

AFP - French crash investigators have failed to find the black boxes from an Air France jet that plunged into the Atlantic and do not yet know whether their hunt will continue, their agency said Tuesday.



Flight AF447 between Rio and Paris was lost almost exactly one year ago when it plunged into the ocean with the loss of all 228 people on board.



The French air accident investigation agency BEA said the latest phase of its undersea search for the Airbus 330-200 jet's flight data recorders had drawn a blank and that the search would halt for at least a month.



""The search came to an end yesterday,"" said BEA chairman Jean-Paul Troadec.



""We have decided to perform a review of all the search operations, which began almost a year ago. We'll bring in our partners. It'll take at least a month or two to do this review and decide whether to continue the hunt.""



Many relatives of victims of the crash allege that the BEA, Airbus and Air France are dragging out the enquiry to avoid admitting that the disaster was caused by a known problem with the jet's air speed monitors.



A series of automatic error messages were emitted by the onboard flight computer shortly before it disappeared from radar, and the BEA has confirmed the plane was receiving faulty speed readings from the Pitot probes.



So far, however, the agency has only said that the Pitots, which are thought to have iced up at high altitude, were a contributing factor and are not thought to be the sole cause of the tragedy.



Air France has since replaced the Pitots on its fleet of Airbus jets with a newer model, without saying that the older one was responsible, as some pilots and lawyers acting for the families have alleged.



Troadec insisted the BEA had not yet any clear scenario in mind as to what caused the crash, and warned that without finding the black boxes -- which now seems extremely unlikely -- the precise cause would be difficult to confirm.

MANHATTAN — The US Airways pilot who ditched his plane into the Hudson River last year after a flock of geese crippled both engines actually had the option of returning to LaGuardia Airport, a federal panel investigating the accident has been told.

The manufacturer of the aircraft, an Airbus A320, told investigators that had Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger decided to attempt a runway landing, the crippled plane had the capability to reach LaGuardia despite a total loss of engine power.

But according to an Airbus document submitted to investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board, the odds of a successful runway landing were not nearly as good as pancaking the plane into the river.

Airbus said that had Sullenberger decided to turn back, he would have had to make the decision almost instantly, leaving no time to gauge the risk that if he missed the runway, the plane might crash into the densely populated neighborhoods that surround LaGuardia.

“Although an emergency return to LaGuardia Runway 13 was technically feasible,” Airbus told investigators, “from a flight performance point of view, the emergency landing on the Hudson seems the most appropriate decision.”

The manufacturer’s assessment, described by the Associated Press, is yet another testament to the quick thinking and sound judgment of Sullenberger, whose actions saved the lives of all 155 passengers and crew in an event that has come to be known as “The Miracle on the Hudson.”

The revelation came in the course of an inquiry by the National Transportation Board, which is working to come up with recommendations for the Federal Aviation Administration on how to minimize the consequences of bird strikes, especially those involving large birds like geese and pelicans.

Among the steps under consideration, officials said, is requiring airlines to begin equipping their planes with bird-proof engines. Another idea is to have pilots undergo mandatory flight-simulator training in water landings.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992535710334778}",neutral,0.9992535710334778,0
At Least 96 Dead In Libyan Plane Crash - WBUR News,"Wed, 12 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxMC8wNS8xMi9saWJ5YW4tcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rescue teams search the site of the Libyan Afriqiyah Airways plane crash in Tripoli, Libya, on Wednesday. (AP)

A Libyan plane crashed Wednesday on approach to Tripoli's airport, killing at least 96 people and leaving a field scattered with smoldering debris that included a large chunk of the tail painted with the airline's brightly colored logo. A 10-year-old Dutch boy was the only known survivor.

Afriqiyah Airways said its Airbus A330-200 arriving from Johannesburg, South Africa was carrying 104 people - 93 passengers and 11 crew. Libyan Transport Minister Mohammed Ali Zaidan said rescuers were still searching for the rest of the victims. The Royal Dutch Tourism Board said 61 of the dead came from the Netherlands.

""This is a large group of Dutch nationals after all, so it's a deeply sad message we have this day,"" Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said, registering his ""shock.""

Libyan state television showed a large field scattered with small and large pieces of plane debris and dozens of police and rescue workers with surgical masks and gloves, some of them carrying at least one body away. They gathered small personal items such as wallets and cell phones from the wreckage.

Others sifted through debris — some of it still smoldering — including a flight recorder and green seats with television screens on them. A large piece of the plane's tail was visible, bearing Afriqiyah's brightly colored logo with the numbers ""9.9.99,"" a reference to the date of the founding of the African Union.

""Afriqiyah Airways announces that our flight 771 had an accident during landing at Tripoli International airport,"" the statement said. ""At this moment, we have no information concerning possible casualties or survivors. Our information is that there were 93 passenger and 11 crew aboard. Authorities are conducting the search and rescue mission.""

Zaidan, the Libyan transport minister, said 96 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage and rescuers were searching for the rest of the victims. Libya's official JANA news agency quoted him as saying a Dutch boy has survived the crash, but did not say anything on his condition.

Balkenende, the Dutch prime minister, confirmed a Dutch boy survived.

The Airbus A330-200 arriving from Johannesburg, South Africa was approaching the airport in the Libyan capital Tripoli when it crashed at around 6 a.m. local time. There was no immediate word on the cause, according to a statement by the airlines posted on its website. Afriqiyah said flight 771 left Johannesburg at 1 a.m. Wednesday.

The airlines later issued a second statement saying a search-and-rescue operation at the crash site ""has now been completed and casualties have been moved to various hospitals.""

It said Tripoli was the flight's final destination.

Weather conditions over Tripoli's international airport were good on Wednesday, with three-mile visibility, scattered clouds at 10,000 feet and winds of only three miles per hour.

A NASA Web site said an ash cloud from Iceland's volcano had reached North Africa by Monday, but a map from Britain's meteorological office showed it was well west of Tripoli at the time of the crash. Brussels-based European air traffic management agency said the thinning volcanic ash cloud that disrupted air traffic over parts of Europe and the Atlantic in the past few days had moved into mid-ocean and was unlikely to have affected an airliner in Libya, more than 2,000 miles to the west.

Daniel Hoeltgen, spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said Afriqiyah has undergone 10 recent safety inspections at European airports, with no significant safety findings. He said a team of French crash investigators was already on its way to Tripoli.

""We are currently talking to Airbus and with the French accident investigator BEA, which will be involved in the investigation,"" said Hoeltgen. ""We will lend our support if this is required by authorities in charge.""

Afriqiyah Airways is not included on the European Union's list of banned airlines. The list has nearly 300 carriers deemed by the EU not to meet international safety standards.

According to initial reports, the plane crashed as it neared the threshold of Tripoli International's main east-west runway, while preparing to touch down from the east. The main runway at Tripoli Airport is 3,600 yards long. According to international airport guides, the airport does not have a precision approach system that guides airplanes down to the runway's threshold, but has two other less sophisticated systems that are in wide use throughout the world.

Wednesday's crash was the third deadly landing accident at Tripoli airport in the past 40 years, according to the Web site of the U.S.-based Flight Safety Foundation. In 1970, a Czechoslovak Airlines Tupolev 104 crashed 3.4 miles from the airport, killing all 13 people on board. A year later, a United Arab Airlines Comet crashed 4.5 miles from the runway threshold, killing all 16 on board. In 1989, a Korean Air DC-10 crashed, killing 75 of the 199 people on the aircraft.

Afriqiyah Airways operates an all Airbus fleet. It was founded in April 2001 and is fully owned by the Libyan government.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998971223831177}",neutral,0.9998971223831177,0
NTSB: Sully Could Have Made it Back to LaGuardia - CBS News,"Tue, 04 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbnRzYi1zdWxseS1jb3VsZC1oYXZlLW1hZGUtaXQtYmFjay10by1sYWd1YXJkaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US Airways Flight 1549 could have made it back to New York's LaGuardia Airport after colliding with geese last year, but under the circumstances the captain's decision to ditch into the Hudson River was the better choice, documents released Tuesday by a federal safety panel said.

The documents, released as the National Transportation Safety Board prepared to consider safety lessons from the accident, show that if pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger had immediately attempted to return to LaGuardia after ingesting geese into both engines the Airbus A320 would have made it - barely.

In simulators at Airbus's training center in Toulouse, France programmed to recreate the conditions faced by US Airways Flight 1549 on that fateful day, pilots were repeatedly able to turn the airliner around after the engines lost power and successfully land on a runway back at LaGuardia, reports CBS News producer Carter Yang.

But that scenario would have required Sullenberger to make an immediate decision with little or no time to assess the situation. He also would have had no way of knowing that he would be successful, and therefore would have been risking the possibility of a catastrophic crash in a densely populated area.

""Although an emergency return to La Guardia Runway 13 was technically feasible from an aircraft flight performance point of view, the emergency landing on the Hudson seems the most appropriate decision,"" Airbus said in an assessment submitted to the board.

Sullenberger chose instead to glide the plane into the river, where a rupture near the plane's tail sent water gushing into the cabin. All 155 passengers and crew aboard managed to escape the sinking aircraft.

Among the issues the safety board is expected to consider are whether during its meeting is whether planes - especially aircraft engines - should be required to withstand collisions with large birds.

The board has long been troubled by the danger to aviation posed by growing populations of many large bird species, including Canada geese, snow geese and white pelicans. The engines on the ditched airliner were designed to withstand a collision with a bird weighing up to 4 pounds. Some more recent jet engines are required to withstand a bird weighing up to 8 pounds.

But a large Canada goose can weigh almost twice that much.

""They've got to deal with the certification standards for these engines based on the size of these birds,"" said former NTSB board member Kitty Higgins.

Higgins, who represented NTSB in New York in the early stages of its investigation into the Jan. 15, 2009, accident, said the board considered recommending to the Federal Aviation Administration last summer that aircraft engines be required to withstand the impact of larger birds.

However, a decision was made to defer a recommendation until the investigation into Flight 1549 was complete, she said.

Another concern was that damage to the A320 from the force of hitting the river prevented the rear escape slides from being used to evacuate passengers - a serious problem could have proved costly if circumstances had been a little different, Higgins said.

Air crashes involving water landings have become so unusual - especially for planes not flying over the ocean - that until Flight 1549 there had been little emphasis on preparing for them. Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles were praised after the accident for their quick judgment, precision flying and teamwork.

It's likely the board will consider whether pilots should receive simulator training for water landings, Higgins said.

As Yang notes, Sullenberger, now retired, discusses his decision in detail in his book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters.""

""I knew that if I chose to turn back across this densely populated area, I had to be certain we could make it,"" Sullenberger writes. ""Once I turned toward LaGuardia, it would be an irrevocable choice. It would rule out every other option. And attempting to reach a runway that was unreachable could have had catastrophic consequences for everyone on the airplane and who knows how many people on the ground. Even if we made it to LaGuardia and missed the runway by a few feet, the result would be disastrous.""

Earlier today, an Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 crashed on landing at Tripoli's international airport in Libya, killing all but one of the 104 passengers and crew on board. There is strikingly little to go on at this point. Weather and visibility were good; volcanic ash was apparently not a factor, and sabotage appears unlikely. But whatever did or didn't go wrong, try not to take your cues from the TV news.

""The Airbus A330 Aircraft has been involved in several high-profile incidents,"" reported one New York station, ""including the landing on the Hudson River in January 2009.""

Wrong, that was an Airbus A320, a short-range plane less than half the size of the widebody, long-range A330. An Airbus is an Airbus, some people seem to think.

This is only the second fatal accident involving an A330. The other was the crash of Air France Flight 447 a year ago off the coast of Brazil. More than 600 A330s have been built since the type entered service in 1994.

And Fox 5's ""aviation expert"" said, ""Everyone knows that African airlines have poor safety records ... some of the worst in the world.""

Any ""expert"" who utters a thing like that ought to be kicked off the set with his mouth wrapped in duct tape. To dis an entire continent with such stereotypical trash is unbecoming of anybody who purports to take aviation safety seriously.

Sadly, though, rest assured we're going to be hearing such garbage over and over in the hours and days ahead.

I went over this a few weeks ago, but I have no choice but to repeat myself:

Statistically, Africa's accident record is indeed the worst in the world. However, that's painting with a very broad brush. To start with, Africa is a huge continent and it depends which region you're looking at. The biggest offenders are the western and central sub-Saharan portions of the continent, not the north. Libya, I'll point out, is right next door to Tunisia, home of the very proud Tunisair -- one of the globe's few national carriers with a perfect safety record. It has never recorded a fatality.

And what is an airline, exactly? In Africa's equatorial reaches you'll find scores of small companies operating with nowhere near the oversight or resources of airlines in the West. But you need to make the distinction between mainline, scheduled, commercial carriers, which are very safe, and lower-tier cargo and non-scheduled operators. Flying on South African Airways, Tunisair or Ethiopian Air Lines, for example, all of whom have respectable records, is not the same as flying aboard a Congolese cargo runner. Africa's ""dangerous"" airlines are not even airlines as most people think of them.

And I would have to place Libya's Afriqiyah Airways in with those mainline carriers. Founded in 2001 as a competitor to the longtime Libyan Arab Airlines, the company doesn't have much of a track record and is very small, with a fleet of fewer than a dozen aircraft. Just the same, it has incurred no serious penalties or violations in its relatively brief history. Crews are sent to Europe for top-notch training, and its fleet is state-of-the-art. This was its first fatal accident.

For what it's worth -- and I needn't be reminded how anecdotal and non-scientific this is -- one of my regular layover hotels overseas is also used by Afriqiyah, and I have met and chatted with Afriqiyah pilots on several occasions. We've talked about airplanes, about training, about working conditions -- about all the things pilots tend to talk about. Always the Afriqiyah crews strike me as competent and highly professional.

One survivor, a 10-year-old boy, was rescued alive from the wreckage of the Afriqiyah jet. Predictably, the media is calling this a ""miracle.""

In fact, most airplane accidents have survivors, some of the history's worst crashes among them. To pick just two: Sixty-one people survived the Tenerife collision in 1977, and four survived the horrific JAL crash outside Tokyo in 1985 -- history's worst and second-worst disasters, respectively.

The idea of a lone passenger making it out alive might seem a fluke, or a ""miracle"" if we must, but it has happened several times. When a Northwest DC-9 crashed in Detroit in 1987, the one survivor was a 4-year-old girl. The survivor of last year's Yemenia crash in the Indian Ocean was a 12-year-old girl.

What it means, if anything, that each of these sole survivors was a young child I can't be sure.

Airbus's general freight hauler: A330-200F technical description - Flightglobal,"Thu, 20 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzcy1nZW5lcmFsLWZyZWlnaHQtaGF1bGVyLWEzMzAtMjAwZi10ZWNobmljYWwtZGVzY3JpcHRpb24vOTM2MzEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Etihad Crystal Cargo begins earning money with its first A330-200 Freighter this summer, it will mark the culmination of a decade-long development effort for Airbus. The new twinjet is the successor to the A300-600F, a product that sold more than 100 aircraft. The airframer is hoping the A330-200F will be at least as popular.

Although Airbus has sold just 66 A330-200Fs to date, this is just the start, says Airbus freighter marketing manager Jonathan Lesieur. ""We see a need for 1,600 midsized freighters over the next 20 years in the 30-80t payload category above the Boeing 757 and below the MD-11, and that's where the A330-200F would play a role. Of these, around 400 will be new-build and the remaining 1,200 through passenger-to-freight 'P2F' conversions,"" Lesieur says.



The A330-200F took off for the start of its flight-test programme on 5 November. Picture: Airbus

The first new-build freighter from Airbus for almost two decades comes after a production hiatus of three years since the last A300-600F was delivered in 2007. This all-cargo version of the airframer's original twinjet was launched into production in 1991 by a FedEx Express order for up to 75 aircraft and entered service three years later. Airbus had been offering maindeck cargo doors on new-build A300s since early in the programme, delivering the first convertible in 1980 to German carrier Hapag-Lloyd. But it was not until the advent of the A300-600F that Airbus entered the freighter-building game proper.

TWILIGHT YEARS

As is often the case with all-cargo variants, the -600F propped up the A300's assembly line during its twilight years, enabling production to extend well beyond the demise of demand for the passenger models.

With A300-600F demand remaining buoyant in the early part of the last decade, but its technology starting to look ""last century"", it was no surprise when Airbus in early 2001 declared it was to develop a cargo version of its then latest twinjet, the fly-by-wire A330-200, to challenge the rival Boeing 767-300F.

Amid talk of a ""substantial"" order for the new freighter version from an unnamed leasing company, Airbus regarded the A330-200F as a ""very low investment"" response to the growing demand for a medium-capacity long-range freighter. But amid pressure on engineering and production resources to get the A380 back on track, this became the launch that never was. By 2004 Airbus executives were conceding that the A330-200F was ""on the back-burner"". By March 2006, it was revived, when then president Noel Forgeard confirmed plans to end A300 production in 2007 and the development of the A330-based freighter to succeed it. In parallel with the -200F, Airbus had also decided to develop a military tanker/transport version of the twinjet.

The A330-200F was finally launched in January 2007, with commitments from Indian cargo start-up Flyington Freighters and lessors Intrepid Aviation Group and Guggenheim Aviation Partners for 32 aircraft. Deliveries were set to begin in late 2009, but during the development programme the schedule has been extended, and last year's cargo market collapse wiped out any pressure on Airbus to rush the new aircraft to market. With Flyington still trying to get off the ground, Etihad Airways' Crystal Cargo arm, which has two A330-200Fs on order, came to the fore and is now set to be launch operator this summer.

The new freighter's DNA can be traced back to the original A330, the 295-seat -300, which was launched into production in June 1987 as the twin-engined sister to the A340 quad, and entered service in January 1994. It became the first Airbus aircraft to be offered with engines from each of the ""big three"" - namely the General Electric CF6-80E1, Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and Rolls-Royce Trent 700.



The door is the same size as the A300's, but some improvements have been made. Picture: Jon Ostrower/Flightglobal

The A330-200 ""shrink"" flew in 1997, and was the subject of a Flight International technical description and cutaway the same year (Flight International, 11-17 June 1997). Five years after the A330-200's 1998 introduction, Airbus brought in a raft of major improvements for the A330/A340. Dubbed the ""enhanced"", the new-build standard represented a mid-life update with key features being a fly-by-wire controlled rudder, an improved version of the two-crew flightdeck comprising liquid crystal displays, and an updated passenger cabin. The first A330 enhanced was MSN555, and Northwest Airlines became the launch operator in mid-2003.

Being the spiritual successor to the A300-600F, Airbus has adapted proven concepts from the earlier aircraft for the A330 Freighter, most notably the main-deck cargo door. This is the same size as the door on the A300, and is in the same position in the forward fuselage, says A330/A340 chief engineer Christian Favre. ""We've reduced the weight compared with the A300, and optimised the systems.""

One change is to the door opening mechanism. On the A300 it had two positions, one of which was almost vertical, but in-service experience has deemed this unnecessary. This was designed to enable bulky items to be craned in to the cargo deck. So the opening angle on the A330 is limited to around 70 ° , and there has been a simplification of the actuation system, which is electrically controlled and remains hydraulically powered.



Gear was changed due to nose-down pitch. Picture: Jon Ostrower/Flightglobal

The mechanical linkage between the aircraft structure and the door has been simplified. ""Before we had one actuator with several links, now we have just one simple actuator,"" says Favre. ""The sensing elements have been modernised, with the old micro-switches replaced by proximity sensors that are more reliable. The change takes account of in-service experience such as during difficult operating environments such as cold weather.""

The A330 inherits Airbus's original ""222in"" (5.64m) wide fuselage introduced with the A300B2 series in 1974, giving a maximum internal width of 5.28m. This enables the maindeck cargo deck to accommodate two 96in high by 96in wide industry standard containers side by side.

At 40.8m, the A330-200F's Class E (ie incorporating a smoke/fire detection/protection system) main deck cargo compartment is only slightly longer than that of the A300-600F, with maximum volume quoted as 336m(11,840ft³). To achieve this volume, Airbus quotes a typical maindeck pallet layout as 22 pallets measuring 96 x 125 x 96in, 18 of which are side-by-side with the remaining four one behind the other in the aft part of the cabin. This has a typical design density of 138-149kg/m³ (8.6-9.3lb/ft³). Total cargo volume rises to 475m³ when the lower holds are included. Customers can purchase the main deck's cargo loading system from AAR Cargo Systems, Ancra International, PFW Aerospace or Telair International.

The compartment is split into two temperature zones forward and aft, each capable of maintaining temperatures as low as 5 ° C (41 ° F), and as high as 25 ° C. This low temperature capability, which was verified during the hot weather testing when the A330-200F made an appearance at this year's Singapore air show, is suitable for transporting perishable goods requiring a 5-8 ° C cabin environment. Cabin temperatures when transporting animals tend to be in the 16-24 ° C range, says Airbus.

To protect the front of the maindeck compartment, Airbus switched from the 9g cargo net of the A300-600F to a solid aluminium barrier wall positioned in the same location relative to the nose. Favre says that a barrier wall design was chosen over the net as it does not deform, enabling the space available behind the cockpit to be used more effectively.

This area is occupied by a courier cabin, from which it is possible to access the cargo compartment through hatches in the barrier wall on each side. The courier area is fully customisable, with features including up to 12 passenger seats, folding flight-attendant seats, a galley, lavatory and flightcrew rest compartment with two bunks. It also includes provisions for a loadmaster workstation.

One significant visual change for the A330-200F is the blister faring under the nose that accommodates the revised landing gear arrangement. Nicknamed ""La boufiolle"" by Airbus's French engineers (referring to the bulbous shape of a chemist's apothecary jar), the fairing is an elegant solution to a problem that took many years to resolve - that is the A330/A340 family's nose-down body angle of around 1.5 ° when on the ground.

While this is not an issue in the passenger role, it threatened to be a headache for cargo loaders moving pallets around on the cargo deck. ""The ultimate objective was to offer an aircraft that was easy to load without requiring power drive units to move pallets around which have maintenance, weight and cost issues,"" says Favre.

""For this we had to have an attitude on the ground as close as possible to 0 ° , and we wanted it to be a little bit better than the A300, which we knew was acceptable. So we've achieved a slope of roughly 0.5/0.6 ° down.""

Favre says that there was a long internal evaluation of possible solutions to the nose-down issue, with the first studies beginning in around 2000, but the final decision - to lower the nosegear leg attachment and the bay - was not taken until 2006.

""There were 13 different options studied, from reasonable ones to unreasonable ones,"" says Favre.

Criteria such as commonality, ""retrofitability"", reliability, weight and cost were all considered. The alternatives that were eventually discarded are as follows:

Shortening the nose gear leg.

Integral jacking system.

Hydraulic extension.

Lengthened gear and bay.

A340-600 nose gear.

A350 nose gear.

Bottle jack.

Aircraft jack.

Ramp.

High-lift towbar-less tractor.

Main deck cargo loading system and power drive units.

Multiple minor changes.

Eventually the choices were boiled down to ""two reasonable ones - change the gear and keep the gear bay, or change the gear bay and keep the gear"", says Favre. The former, which centred on a shortening gear-leg incorporating a compressing oleo, was initially favoured, but ultimately the latter was adopted because ""for the customer it is fly and forget - with common gear to the passenger model"".

So Airbus has simply lowered where the nose-gear leg's articulation link attaches by 370mm (14.5in). This gives the required deck angle on the ground, but puts the gear outside the fuselage loft line, Farvre says. ""Therefore we had to design a fairing, which we could show by CFD [computational fluid dynamics] analysis had almost zero drag impact. And this has been confirmed in flight-testing - there is no buffet or noise and the high-speed performance is beyond expectations.""

From a performance and payload perspective, the A330-200F is in a different league to its predecessor, being able to carry around 15t more payload than the A300-600F a further 2,500km (1,350nm). This means it can haul a maximum payload of 70t over 5,930km, or in ""range mode"" fly 65t over a maximum distance of 7,400km.

UPGRADES

Structurally the A330-200F benefits from all the weight growth of the passenger variants, and its development has fed back further upgrades to its sister models, says Favre.

""The A330-200 passenger variant was initially operated with a maximum take-off weight of 215t, and 230t was available in 1998. In 2000 we introduced what we called the 'growth' with 233t MTOW,"" he says.

The ""growth"" was the first of two structural developments on the aircraft, the second of which being central to the enhanced variant introduced in 2003, but not incorporating any further weight increases.

""The enhanced had important changes to the fuselage and wing - material changes and weight reduction. It was a re-optimisation of the aircraft with the main objective to increase the design service goal,"" says Favre. ""Improvements included an enhanced landing gear with design improvements.""

The freighter has the 233t MTOW of current A330-200s, while MZFW is up to 8t above the passenger variant, at 178t. But the passenger model is about to gain further weight growth and performance, thanks to the freighter. ""When we were developing the freighter, we had a close look at the wing in particular, which was the limiting element, and could find the margins to demonstrate the passenger aircraft could be capable of 235t MTOW, or 238t with a 2t reduction maximum zero fuel weight [to 168t].""

This upgrade, which is introduced this year on new-build aircraft providing up to an additional 650km range, will be available as a retrofit to the in-service A330s built to enhanced standard (that is, from MSN555) with a small package of modifications.

""There are some material changes in some areas on the fuselage around the centre section and some new fasteners,"" says Favre, with no wing modifications are needed for the majority of eligible aircraft. Meanwhile, further weight and range growth ""is being studied"" for the freighter, he adds.

Given its all-freight role, the A330-200F is devoid of passenger windows (bar a couple for courier zone occupants and for visual inspections) and has just the passenger variant's two forward (L1/L2) cabin doors. Beneath the skin, Favre says Airbus has optimised the aircraft's structure for its cargo role. ""The A330-200F was designed as a freighter - that is to say we redesigned some of the sections - in particular the mid-wing areas and the forward fuselage section 13/14 where the cargo door is installed,"" he says.

OPTIMUM STRUCTURE



Several considerations were taken into account to optimise the structure for the freighting role says Favre. ""Firstly, a freighter has a more forward CG [centre of gravity] than on a passenger aircraft so there is an impact on the loads that we have to take into account.

""Secondly, we have specific loads to accommodate that required the floor and adjacent areas to reinforced.

""Thirdly, we want to offer flexibility to cargo loading and allow maximum freedom for cargo along the fuselage, so we sized the aircraft accordingly. A sheer and bending curve was determined to develop a load envelope with the highest probability of success in enabling any combination of pallet loading.""

Favre says that the A330-200F is able to have a significantly more forward CG than the passenger version: ""The maximum forward CG certificated on the freighter is 16%, compared with 18% on the passenger variant.""

At the time Airbus was developing the freighter it launched a weight-saving campaign across all the variants. Favre says that as well as simply to save weight, the exercise was designed to ""more than offset"" the weight gains associated with additional materials and systems required for compliance with future safety regulations regarding flammability standards for insulation and centre fuel-tank inerting.

The A330-200's centre tank is deactivated on the -200F to save the weight of the inerting system, reducing fuel capacity by 41,560 litres. However it is offered as an option.

Modifications included material changes, such as a switch to that used on the A380 for some air conditioning bleed pipes, says Favre. Overall, the ""diet"" shaved off between 200kg and 250kg on the passenger aircraft, depending on whether it is a -200 or -300.

A specific weight-reduction campaign was also applied to the A330-200F from the start, related to freighter-specific items, says Favre. ""We had three specific efforts -weight reduction common with the passenger variants; savings specific to the -200F compared with A300-600F and our initial estimations; and the use of all available margins that we had on the fuselage and the wing.""

One example of how weight was saved was the switch from glassfibre to carbonfibre for the floor panel material. Overall, the A330-200F incorporates some 9t of advanced materials (carbonfibre, glassfibre and quartzfibre reinforced plastic), which are used in areas such as the flaps, the fin and tailplane, the belly faring, gear doors, radome and engine cowlings.

The success of the programme allowed Airbus to announce at the time of the first flight that the -200F's empty weight had turned out to be 1t less than originally forecast. This improvement went straight to the bottom line, boosting the maximum payload from the 69t originally forecast to 70t.

""We have already weighed one aircraft and we are well within this,"" says Favre. ""Once we have weighed three we will be perfectly sure to confirm this to the customers and incorporate it in the offers.""

The A330-200F is offered with the latest PW4000 and Trent 700 engine options from P&W and R-R, respectively. GE is not on the -200F programme as it could not make a strong enough business case. Airbus quotes thrust ratings in the 68,000-71,100lb (303-317kN) range, and specifically the PW4170A at 70,000lb and Trent 772B at 71,100lb. Both engines have been subject to enhancement packages introduced last year, dubbed the Advantage 70 and 700EP, respectively.

The PW4000-powered version became the lead powerplant for certification, a legacy of the engine's selection by original launch customer Flyington Freighters. The flight-test programme began on 5 November 2009 with the first flight of the PW4000-powered MSN1004. A second aircraft, the Trent 700-powered MSN1032, joined the programme on 20 January, although 1004 flew the bulk of the roughly 200h in the test and certification programme. European approval was granted on 9 April.MSN1032 will be the first delivered this summer to launch operator Etihad Airways. The five deliveries due this year include the first of three for lessor Aircastle placed with China's Hainan Airlines. The first test aircraft, for Turkish Airlines, is being re-engined with Trents.

A330-200F SALES FORTUNES ENDURE BUMPY RIDE



ALTHOUGH Airbus's A330-200F salesmen got off to a strong start, the recent downturn in the cargo market stymied bookings. This, allied to the surge in demand for passenger A330s in the wake of the 787 delays, has caused the -200F's orderbook to decline slightly, and it now stands at 66 aircraft from 11 customers. The freighter's sales tally represents only a small proportion of total A330 sales, which stand at 1,015 aircraft, of which 688 have been delivered (379 -200s and 309 -300s).

Airbus needs to quickly take advantage of the current rebound in the cargo market to build the orderbook with some blue-chip cargo airlines. Two-thirds of the current orders (44) are from lessors, while there are doubts over the biggest airliner customer, Indian start-up Flyington Freighters, which has yet to launch.

The A330-200F's range, payload and cargo volume pitches it primarily at the general cargo market, as a rival to the lower-payload, shorter-range Boeing 767-300F and it is positioned to replace the ageing fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10Fs.

""For the first time, with the A330-200F there is a competitor in the midsize payload category that has range equivalent to the larger long-haul freighters, but offering better unit costs,"" says Airbus's freighter marketing manager Jonathan Lesieur. He believes that the current environment of rising fuel cost and low yields will attract customers to the A330 from the fuel-thirsty DC-10 trijets.

But if Airbus is going to tap the potentially huge market for the replacement of package freighters operated by integrators such as FedEx Express, which is driven by high volume rather than cargo density, it will need a freighter version of the larger A330-300. This is most likely to come through the conversion of ex-airline -300s, says Lesieur, so the needs of a future passenger-to-freighter (P2F) modification programme were considered during the development of the -200 production freighter. ""A lot of the -200F engineering would apply to a -300P2F,"" he says. ""It would have 20% more volume than the A330-200F, but around 8-10t lower payload, which means its design density is more for express carriers.""

Didier Lenormand, Airbus freighter marketing chief, explains the A330-200F's key features. Watch here:

"The biggest, richest, best and worst airlines - Salon","Fri, 07 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDEwLzA1LzA3L3dvcmxkc19iaWdnZXN0X2Jlc3Rfd29yc3RfYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Emirates Airline, owned by the government of Dubai, is a small presence among international giants,"" so said a USA Today front-page story on May 5 written by Kevin Johnson and Thomas Frank. They were talking about the arrest of would-be Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad at Kennedy airport. Emirates, the reporters continued, offers ""just two daily direct flights to the United Arab Emirates.""

That was a coffee-spitter if ever there was one, and about the most ludicrous characterization of an airline I've ever heard. A small presence * in the United States * is what they meant, I think. Say what you want of USA Today, the paper's air travel coverage is comparatively decent most of the time, and we'd expect Johnson and Frank to have a reasonable grasp of the global airline scene.

At last count, Emirates is the eighth-largest airline in the world measured by revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs), ahead of players like JAL, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific, and just a notch behind British Airways. Its all-widebody fleet includes the planet's largest number of Boeing 777s and A380s, with over 50 of the latter still on order. It operates hundreds of daily flights, not ""just two,"" into its Dubai mega-hub.

There isn't anybody, anywhere, who could call that a small presence.

Not that there aren't bigger carriers.

Which got me thinking. The announced merger between United and Continental is going to result in one very, very large airline. ""Continented,"" as I'm calling it, will soon be flying around 750 planes, including an immense fleet of 747, 767, 777 and 787 widebodies, and hauling some 110 million customers each year.

Curious to see where the rest of the major carriers will fall in context, I broke out the latest copy of Air Transport World's ""World Airline Report.""

Airline size is a relative thing. It depends how you measure it. The simplest gauge is just to tally up the total number of passengers carried annually. Using this method, the largest carrier on the planet over the past several years has been -- would you believe it -- Southwest. That's fairly astonishing for an airline that operates nothing but short-haul 737s. Frequency. Volume. Quantity.

But a more accurate metric is something called a revenue passenger kilometer, or RPK. One passenger traveling one kilometer equals one RPK. In other words, flying a hundred people from Cape Town to London outscores flying them from Dallas to Phoenix. Except, running Dallas to Phoenix 12 times a day can make up the difference. Thus RPKs account for customer volume, frequency of flights and distances flown.

This kicks Southwest down to a more realistic seventh place. By the same token, Emirates is the planet's eighth largest in RPKs, yet fails to crack the top 20 in passengers (still not ""small presence"" material by any stretch, but smaller). Little known China Southern is at No. 6 in total passengers, but 14th by RPKs. And so on.

The 20 largest airlines in the world, ranked by RPKs (excludes regional subsidiaries)

1. Continented (pending merger between United and Continental)

2. Delta Air Lines

3. American Airlines

4. Air France / KLM

5. Lufthansa

6. Southwest Airlines

7. British Airways

8. Emirates

9. US Airways

10. Cathay Pacific

11. Singapore Airlines

12. Japan Airlines (JAL)

13. Qantas

14. China Southern

15. Air Canada

16. Air China

17. All Nippon Airways (ANA)

18. Thai Airways

19. Ryanair

20. Korean Air

You'll notice that Air France and KLM are counted together. I wish this weren't so, but that's the way the data is tracked. The two companies merged in 2004, but have kept separate operational structures, with independent fleets and employee groups.

You might be tempted to think of the biggest airline as the one with the most aircraft, but capacity differences make this reasoning specious. American Eagle, for instance, has more planes than JAL, Qantas or All Nippon, but is nowhere close when it comes to passengers or RPKs. For the record, Continented and Delta hold the top positions with about 750 jetliners each, followed by American with just over 600. Air France's 260 (not including KLM) comprises the largest non-U.S. fleet, followed closely by Lufthansa and China Southern. FedEx, incidentally, has 340 jet freighters, and UPS 220. Obviously these totals are subject to frequent change as planes are bought, sold, mothballed and retired.

Is there a correlation between size and profitability? Not really. Going back to that ""World Airline Report,"" here were the top-10 best-performing airlines, measured in annual net profit:

1. Qantas

2. Lufthansa

3. Turkish Airlines

4. Singapore Airlines

5. LAN (Chile, Peru, Ecuador)

6. Emirates

7. Aeroflot

8. Southwest Airlines

9. Air New Zealand

10. COPA (Panama)

Plenty of stars on that list, but almost no stars and stripes. We're used to this, sadly. Year after year, it seems, carriers outside the United States tend to be profitable while our own biggest airlines slip deeper and deeper into the red. Why is this? That's an enormous question that we simply don't have time or space to adequately answer. Competitive environment, state ownership and subsidies, and the price of labor all play a role.

Though not always in the ways, or to the extent, that people think. Take the second factor. Not all of those 10 carriers in the above list are privately run, bringing up the issue of governments that provide tax breaks, subsidies and other favors for airlines they sometimes own outright. There's a widely held assumption that this is done excessively and unfairly, but in truth the degrees vary. For example, many EU and Asian carriers have been upset over the massive expansion of Emirates, which they attribute to coddling of the carrier by its owner, the government of the United Arab Emirates. Perhaps, though a pair of audits by two renowned investment houses concluded otherwise. ""We could not find anything in Emirates' accounts which indicated that the business is subsidized directly or indirectly or given undue preference,"" said one representative, speaking in Air Transport World. People point out that Emirates pays no corporate income tax, but as the ATW feature noted, it also bears significant social costs by providing housing and education for thousands of expatriate employees.

Either way, we're foolish to go searching overseas for answers. The problem isn't between the U.S. airlines and those in other countries, it's between the U.S. airlines themselves, operating in the most competitively cutthroat theater that exists, with the legacy majors under constant siege by nimble, low-cost opportunists like JetBlue and Southwest.

Meanwhile, neither size nor profitability is a firm indicator of customer satisfaction. Which are the best carriers, in terms of overall service?

Let's see what SkyTrax says. SkyTrax is a prestigious air travel advisory group that ranks carriers on a scale of one to five stars. Currently only six airlines meet the group's strict criteria for five-star status, awarded only to those ""at the forefront of product and service delivery excellence, often setting trends to be followed by other airlines."" They are, alphabetically:

Asiana Airlines (Korea)

Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong)

Kingfisher Airlines (India)

Malaysia Airlines

Qatar Airways

Singapore Airlines

Dropping down a notch, 29 carriers manage to hit four-star status. This is where you'll find most of the mainstay Asians and Europeans, plus a few surprises. The list includes Air France, Emirates, British Airways, Lufthansa, JAL, Korean, Qantas, Air New Zealand, Swiss, Thai, Turkish and South African Airways. The sole U.S. finisher is JetBlue.

The rest of the Americans are all in the three-star category, having achieved ""a satisfactory standard of core product across most travel categories, but poor or less consistent standards of staff service/product quality in selected on board or airport features."" This is the biggest group by far. Delta, United, American, US Airways and Continental join the likes of Ethiopian Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas, Pakistan International, Iberia and dozens of others. Southwest is here too.

It could be worse. Thankfully there are no Americans among the 25 or so names on the two-star list. Here you'll find Cubana, Uzbekistan Airways, TAAG Angola and Biman Bangladesh. And Ryanair.

Previous efforts to offer a development of the A321 for NATO's alliance ground surveillance requirement and an A319-based maritime patrol aircraft to the Indian navy failed to secure production orders.

Meanwhile, Airbus expects to receive military certification for its A330-based multirole tanker transport in July, clearing the way for the type (below) to enter delayed service with launch customer the Royal Australian Air Force before the end of the year.

INTERIORS: Airbus spices up galley offering | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 19 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW50ZXJpb3JzLWFpcmJ1cy1zcGljZXMtdXAtZ2FsbGV5LW9mZmVyaW5nLzkzNTc3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is focusing on three airlines interested in installing its new Spice (space innovative catering equipment) galley cart, and is hoping to announce a manufacturer by September. However, the product is unlikely to launch this year.

Demonstrating a functional prototype of the SPICE galley at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, Airbus head of interiors marketing Bob Lange says the system has been tested with 11 airlines and this has shown ""a generic business case that is overwhelmingly positive"". The next step is for airlines to carry out their own personalised test case, and Airbus is working with three unnamed carriers.

Lange anticipates the new galley will enter airline service 24 to 30 months after its launch, but the launch is not expected to happen this year. ""We are talking to galley manufacturers and somebody will go first, but it's too early to name a name,"" says Lange. ""At the moment we're focusing on three airlinesa decision this year is possible, but I would be surprised.""

Lange points out that Airbus is ""trying to change something that's not changed in 40 years"", and he is ""conscious of the fact that it's taken us three years to get to this point"". However, he adds that the reaction from the 11 airlines that have tested the system has been ""push, push, push"".

The Spice galley replaces the traditional catering trolley with lightweight boxes and foldable carts for service. Each box weighs 6kg when empty and eight boxes are needed on an Airbus A330, rather than the 40 or 50 trolleys that are currently required, says Lange. This means a weight saving of 550kg on an A330 and up to 1t on an A380. Space-wise, installation of the system would allow for three more seats on an A330 and 10 or more extra seats on an A380.

At the moment, the Spice galley has only been developed with widebody aircraft in mind. However, Lange says Airbus has ""started looking at"" designing a system for single-aisle aircraft, which could lead to a possible weight saving of 40kg to 80kg on an Airbus A320.

ILA: A400M heads for Berlin debut | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 31 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaWxhLWE0MDBtLWhlYWRzLWZvci1iZXJsaW4tZGVidXQvOTM3NDMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some thought that it would never fly, while others believed that development issues and programme delays would lead to its cancellation. But Airbus Military's A400M will make its long-awaited first public appearance at this month's Berlin air show, with the manufacturer intent on showing its European customers that their continued commitment to its flagship product will be rewarded.

The A400M should have debuted at ILA two years ago under previous plans, but its historic first showing will still be well placed, given Germany's status as the largest single customer for the type.

Berlin's stake in the project accounts for one-third of the 180 aircraft ordered in a May 2003 contract signed by the governments of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK via Europe's OCCAR procurement agency.



Germany has ordered 60 of the 180 A400Ms commissioned at the programme's launch in 2003. Picture: Airbus Military

To replace its air force's Dassault-Breguet C160 Transalls, Germany's 60 A400Ms were originally scheduled to be delivered to Wunstorf air base from this year. However, this schedule has slipped by around three years, so the venerable twin-turboprop will have to soldier on for some time.

Highlighting the nation's programme standing, a German officer also recently became the first non-Airbus pilot to fly an A400M. Drawn from a multinational test team that will support military certification activities, the pilot ""was really impressed"", says Airbus. Representatives from the European Aviation Safety Agency were due to fly the aircraft for the first time in late May.

German industry is also heavily involved in the A400M project. The aircraft's fuselage is delivered to Airbus's San Pablo final assembly line near Seville, Spain via A300-600 Beluga from Bremen. The nation also hosts the assembly of the aircraft's Europrop International TP400-D6 turboprop engines at MTU Aero Engines' Ludwigsfelde site. Vertical tailplanes are delivered from Stade, while the programme's fatigue test aircraft is in Dresden.

However, the German air force's A400M fleet now appears likely to be reduced slightly as Berlin looks to balance the effects of a major overrun to the previously fixed cost of developing and producing the type.

Agreed at €20 billion ($24 billion), this figure has now been increased by at least €4.3 billion under an in-principle agreement reached by the EADS-led company and its customers on 5 March.

Saving the programme from possible cancellation, the launch nations agreed to pay a combined €2 billion more for their aircraft, waive all liquidated damages linked to the delay and to invest a further €1.5 billion in support of Airbus's efforts to export the A400M. The company has also made its own financial provisions as part of the deal.

CANCELLATION OPTION

As part of the agreement, Airbus offered its customers the option to cancel up to 10 aircraft from the original 180. Germany is believed to be keen on removing seven A400Ms from its order, with the UK having already confirmed its intention to reduce its 25-strong commitment by up to three.

In addition to potentially stripping some aircraft from its order, Berlin has also instructed Airbus Military to abandon some of its unique configuration requirements. These include a sophisticated terrain-following navigation system that was being developed by EADS Defence Electronics uniquely for the German air force.

Germany has deleted a requirement for its A400Ms to have a terrain-following navigation system. Picture: Airbus Military

""We have an agreement with the German customer to stop that one,"" says Airbus Military managing director Domingo Ureña. ""Every­body understands the economical situation,"" he adds. ""We all need to make efforts, and we opened the door with these [10] aircraft.""

Ureña says the company and its customers have shown a ""willingness to conclude as soon as possible the formalisation of the agreement. Our target, which we still consider to be feasible, is to have everything ticked, and final approval by the governments before the end of the summer.""

Meanwhile, a dispute with engine supplier Europrop over its role in programme delays is being resolved. ""We've stopped to claim against each other,"" Ureña confirms. ""Common sense indicated to the two companies to start a process to constructively resolve our problems. We are married for a long time, and divorce is not allowed.""

However, relations with Thales are still at a low, and this situation with a major supplier ""is the real concern at this moment of the programme"", he says.

When Ureña took the helm at Airbus Military in February 2009, the Spanish official was faced with guiding the company through a potentially traumatic integration with Airbus from EADS's Military Transport Aircraft division, while also ensuring that the A400M flew before the end of the year.

With the integration activity having concluded on 1 January, Ureña says the benefits are already evident. ""Now, nobody has doubts that we are only one company, as part of Airbus,"" he says. ""We try to share the skills of engineering, production, systems and tools. Our customers are starting to appreciate the value.""

With a new contract to place the A400M in a stable position, Ureña says Airbus is committed to ""deliver the aircraft fulfilling the guarantees that we have with the customers. The A400M is not capital, it is strategic,"" he adds.

Ureña says that the European aerospace industry faces a significant near-term challenge, as nations look to reduce their military procurement budgets and place increased support on operations such as those in Afghanistan. However, he believes that positives can still be drawn.

""I am convinced that in difficult times we have more opportunities. It's very easy to make business when everybody has plenty of money,"" he says.

Airbus has identified a potential market to sell 350-500 more A400Ms to international customers, says senior vice-president commercial Antonio Rodriguez-Barberán. Two potential new air force customers have visited Spain within the last several weeks, but he declines to name them.

Malaysia is the only such buyer for the design, and will receive four. South Africa late last year cancelled its eight-strong order, just weeks before prototype aircraft MSN001 made its first flight on 11 December.

SOUTH AFRICA

Airbus is assessing its long-term ties with South African industry, but with more than €300 million of its own money already invested in local companies it has decided against removing existing work packages. However, it recently rejected one re-bid proposal from Denel Saab Aerostructures.

""We try to engage in dialogue with the customer, and hope that they will reconsider the decision,"" says Ureña. ""Sooner or later, South Africa will need the A400M,"" he believes.

Ed Strongman, Airbus's chief test pilot military, hopes to encourage wider market interest in the transport by displaying MSN001 at ILA on 8 and 9 June. The company cannot commit to a longer stay to keep momentum with flight testing, but will ""demonstrate the full capabilities of the aircraft"", he says.

Tests involving MSN001 and MSN002 - both of which carry heavy instrumentation loads weighing around 17t - had reached 165 flight hours and 44 sorties by 20 May.

Recent milestones have included the completion of stall testing without the need to use an emergency booster recovery rocket, which has now been removed from MSN001.

""We approached our first stall with a lot of attention, but it was a piece of cake,"" says Strongman. The crew encountered buffeting only within around 1° of reaching the stall angle, and the pilots retained full roll control throughout the manoeuvres.

""It's a remarkable aeroplane,"" he says. ""It has as good, or better handling qualities than an A320."" He attributes this partly to the A400M's counter-rotating propeller configuration, which adds to its stability under such conditions.

Stall testing was conducted between idle and full power and with forward, centre and aft centre of gravity loadings, and at altitudes between 32,000ft (9,760m) and 10,000ft.

Strongman declines to identify the angles of attack achieved before the stall, but confirms: ""The alphas were as predicted, and in some cases higher.""

The test team is establishing where limits exist, and the A400M's envelope protection will prevent operational crews from encountering potentially dangerous conditions.

This process also included demonstrating the A400M's impressive maximum lateral roll rate. Airbus is required to certificate its roll protection at 90°, but says it will instead offer 120°. Strongman says the test actually demonstrated an angle of 124° due to an incorrect stick input, but adds that this was still ""well within the range of the aeroplane. It was Friday night and it was 8 o'clock, but it was good,"" he adds.

The aircraft during April underwent testing at Istres in southern France to assess its handling characteristics in ground effect down to just 15ft above the runway. ""We were just on the limits of turbulence also, so it was a really good simulation,"" says Strongman.

Full sideslip and load factors testing have been completed, the aircraft has been operated across its stress range of +2.5g to -1g, and its doors and cargo ramp have been opened in flight at between 120kt (222km/h) and 200kt without affecting handling characteristics.

A maximum altitude of 34,000ft has been achieved, and the A400M was due to be taken to its VD velocity limit, and to perform flutter validation flights in late May. At this point, a major restriction to testing can be lifted, with stress gauges to be removed from the TP400's Ratier-Figeac propeller blades. This will enable the flight test team to fly the A400M through clouds and rain for the first time.

In an unusual parallel with a past programme, Strongman says that during some flight conditions and angles of attack at higher altitudes, the A400M exhibited a slight snaking motion. Experience within Airbus likened the characteristic with the Transall, and adopted the same solution. Strakes added to the main landing gear sponsons now act as vortex generators, and Strongman says the trait has not been encountered on any subsequent flights.

OVERHEATING ISSUE

Other earlier issues from flight testing are in the process of being addressed, such as to fix a landing gear overheating issue. More work will be performed to define braking limits and to perform rejected take-offs. A new high power mode full authority digital engine control software load for the TP400 has also recently been tested on one engine, and will soon be expanded to all stations.

Although flight-test activities got off to a slower than expected start, because of unusually bad weather in Seville and Toulouse over the winter months, MSN001 in mid-May for the first time flew twice in one day.

""The whole process is accelerating,"" says Strongman, who describes the transport as intuitive and easy to operate.

""Every pilot has a smile on his face, due to the A400M's handling and manoeuvrability,"" Strongman says.

MORE A400MS POISED TO JOIN FLIGHT TESTING

In late May, MSN003 was in the midst of securing clearance to fly in ""early summer"". Picture: Airbus Military

With the A400M programme's first two prototype aircraft now being flown regularly in France and Spain, Airbus Military is preparing to double the size of its test fleet within the next six months.

Due to fly in the ""early summer"", MSN003 was in late May undergoing final clearance tests on the company's San Pablo final assembly line near Seville, and will soon be transferred to its flight-test department at the site.

To be employed for systems testing from Toulouse, the aircraft has several modifications made following the lessons learned in early flight-testing. These include the addition of small strakes on the main landing gear sponsons and a lower auxiliary power unit exhaust chimney.

Aircraft MSN004 is in the general joining stage at San Pablo and was scheduled to undergo power-on for the first time in the last week of May. First flight is planned before the end of the year.

All major components for the remaining flight-test example are in production and final assembly work will start in the third quarter of this year. The first A400M to be built to a series production standard, MSN006 will have weight reduction modifications and other system upgrades.

Parts are also being produced for the programme's first customer aircraft, which should be delivered to the French air force in December 2012. The San Pablo facility is expected to complete 2.5 aircraft a month by 2015, against a peak of three a month.

""Production is working smoothly and we think we are on the way to success,"" says Rafael Nogueras Cebrero, head of the A400M final assembly line and flight-test centre.

France will send four Airbus engineers and three forensic officers to help investigate the cause of the Libyan Airbus crash Tuesday that killed 103 people.

A young Dutch boy miraculously survived the fatal crash, Libyan officials have confirmed. The 10-year-old is in hospital with serious injuries, but is reportedly out of danger.

A 32-year-old French woman was among the victims.

The Airbus A330-200, which had been in service only since September, was flying from Johannesburg to the Libyan capital when it crashed just short of the runway around 6 a.m. (0400 GMT), the airline and planemaker said.

The aircraft is the same type as Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic on June 1 last year. The cause of that crash has not been firmly identified.

Saleh Ali Saleh, an executive with Libya's Afriqiyah Airways told Reuters 62 Dutch nationals had been among the passengers and crew on board the plane which crashed on Wednesday.

""Everybody is dead, except for one child,"" said Libyan Transport Minister Mohamed Zidan. The plane was carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew, Libyan officials and executives from the airline said.

A manifest of those on board was not released but officials in Libya and in the passengers' countries of origin said besides the Dutch contingent they included small numbers of nationals from Britain, Germany, the Philippines, South Africa, France and Zimbabwe.

The transport minister said investigators were working out what went wrong with Afriqiyah Airways Flight 8U771. He ruled out terrorism as the cause. He said arrangements were being made to help victims' family members come to Tripoli.

Mohamed Rashid, a doctor at Tripoli's al-Khadra hospital, said the child was doing well after surgery.

""The operation was successful and he is under our care,"" he told reporters, adding that some of the medical staff spoke Dutch and were able to communicate with the patient.



Bandaged head

Footage broadcast on Libyan state television showed the child in a hospital bed, conscious and wearing a breathing mask. The only visible sign of any injury was a bandage around the top of the child's head.

Saleh, the Afriqiyah Airways executive, told Reuters that the plane's black boxes had been recovered from the crash site.

""The deaths were probably due to the impact as I did not hear any report of a fire. The plane was travelling fast as it was still short of the runway when it crashed,"" Saleh said.

Reuters’ pictures from the crash site showed the ground carpeted with small pieces of debris, including a Dutch-language guide book to South Africa. Only the aircraft's tail fin was more or less intact, standing upright but leaning at an angle.

Libyan newspaper Quryna reported that shortly before the crash the pilot had contacted the control tower to ask them to alert emergency services because there was a problem with the plane. There was no official confirmation of that report.

Afriqiyah Airways, which is owned by the Libyan state and was established in 2001, has never before had a crash.

European aviation safety officials told Reuters that Afriqiyah's aircraft -- including the plane in Wednesday's crash -- had been subject to regular inspections and no significant problems had been reported.

AFP - The pilot of the Libyan airliner that crashed with the loss of 103 lives reported no technical problems before this week's accident, the head of the commission of inquiry said on Friday.

""The pilot did not report any problems. Until the very last moment things were normal between the pilot and the control tower"" at Tripoli airport before Wednesday's early morning disaster, Neji Dhaou told AFP.

""What I can confirm for now is that the aircraft struck the ground before reaching the runway,"" he said, adding that the investigators ""have ruled out nothing for the moment.""

The inquiry team is made up of Libyan and South African officials, as well as two French experts, five more from manufacturer Airbus and two observers from the Netherlands.

Officials said 103 people were killed in the crash of the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330-200 flight from Johannesburg in South Africa. There was one survivor, a nine-year-old Dutch boy.

Aviation experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board are due to join the inquiry later on Friday ""because the engines and navigation system are American-made,"" Dhaou said.

Questions left unanswered as Schreiber jailed for 8 years - The Globe and Mail,"Thu, 06 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9xdWVzdGlvbnMtbGVmdC11bmFuc3dlcmVkLWFzLXNjaHJlaWJlci1qYWlsZWQtZm9yLTgteWVhcnMvYXJ0aWNsZTEyMTE1MDQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a wave and a smile, Karlheinz Schreiber leaves court in Augsburg, Germany, to begin his prison sentence.TIMM SCHAMBERGER/AFP / Getty Images Share

Karlheinz Schreiber, the German-Canadian businessman at the centre of the Airbus scandal for the past 15 years, has been sentenced to eight years in a German prison for tax evasion.

Mr. Schreiber, whose revelations kept Airbus bubbling back into the public consciousness at regular intervals, was found guilty of withholding about $10-million from the German government between 1988 and 1993, a period before the Canadian controversy had even begun to surface. The money was gleaned as kickbacks from sales of armoured cars, helicopters and aircraft around the world, some of which took place in Canada, prosecutors alleged.

He was also a central figure in a funding scandal that forced former German chancellor Helmut Kohl to resign his post as honorary party leader after he admitted his party accepted illegal party donations - some from Mr. Schreiber.

In handing down the sentence, Judge Rudolf Weigell described Mr. Schreiber as ""the type of person only concerned with his own advantage, who will bribe anyone and anything if things aren't going to plan, and who will cheat the tax man in any way he can.""

Prosecutors had asked for 9 1/2 years in prison. Mr. Schreiber is expected to appeal what is considered by some experts to be a long sentence for a tax breach.

One of Mr. Schreiber's Canadian lawyers, Robert Hladun, said from Edmonton that he felt the sentence was ""very harsh."" He said he hoped the imposition of such a long term was not politically motivated because in the German case ""politics did seem to be playing a very large part of what was going on.""

It took the German government a decade to get Mr. Schreiber back in the country to face the tax charges, which originally included broader allegations of bribery and fraud that were later dropped.

He was arrested by the RCMP at a Toronto hotel on Aug. 31, 1999, at the request of German authorities, but numerous appeals and court challenges kept him in Canada. He made application to the minister of justice on several occasions, sought a judicial review of those decisions at the Ontario Court of Appeal, and even took his case to the Supreme Court. His last appeals ran out last summer and he was finally flown to Germany on Aug. 2, 2009.

""In some ways, this is the end of the road,"" said Harvey Cashore, a journalist who has just released a book on his 15-year investigation of the Airbus affair. ""Schreiber is 76 and an eight-year sentence is long for anybody.""

Still, Mr. Cashore said, ""there are a lot of secrets out there about this scandal. We still know there are millions in shmiergelder [grease money]unaccounted for, but it is looking more and more like German and Canadian institutions don't want to find out any more about it.""

Mr. Schreiber's rise to notoriety in Canada began in 1995, when he was named in a letter sent by Ottawa to Swiss authorities. The Justice department and the RCMP said they needed help looking at bank accounts because of suspicions Mr. Schreiber had been paid secret commissions on the sale of Airbus aircraft to Air Canada, then a Crown corporation. The letter alleged that some of that money was channelled to former prime minister Brian Mulroney and former lobbyist Frank Moores to ensure Airbus got the contract.

Mr. Mulroney sued for libel, and won a settlement from the government that included an apology and the payment of his legal fees.

Over the following years, Mr. Schreiber made several allegations. In 2007, he said he had given Mr. Mulroney $300,000 in cash in 1993 and 1994, and that the former prime minister waited six years to declare the income to tax authorities. Mr. Mulroney acknowledged $225,000 in payments, and said they were for legitimate work.

In late 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper ordered a probe into the business dealings between Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Mulroney, to be led by Mr. Justice Jeffrey Oliphant, but the terms of reference prevented the judge from looking into the Airbus affair.

Mr. Schreiber's testimony at the inquiry helped delay his extradition.

With Mr. Schreiber in jail in Germany, one significant question is still unanswered, said William Kaplan, a lawyer and author who has written extensively about the Airbus affair. ""The only question that really matters in this country … is never going to be answered: Were there payoffs made in Airbus, and if so who got them?""

Mr. Schreiber's conviction did not get any closer to answering that, Mr. Kaplan said. Even the report of the Oliphant inquiry, expected to be released at the end of the month, will likely ""not tell us anything we didn't already know,"" he said.

Frank Moores, the late Newfoundland premier, played a role in the money trail in the Mulroney-Schreiber affair, but Justice Jeffrey Oliphant could not determine how much.

In a lengthy report released Monday, Oliphant determined that former prime minister Brian Mulroney acted inappropriately by accepting $225,000 in cash from German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber.

Moores's name was heard often during testimony at the Oliphant inquiry, particularly involving his personal relationship with Mulroney during his stints as a former premier and then as a lobbyist through Ottawa-based Government Consultants International.

One of the terms of reference for Oliphant was to track the money trail, or more precisely how cash payments came into Mulroney's possession.

Oliphant was told that Moores made a $500,000 deposit to a Swiss bank account that had the code name ""Frankfurt."" As well, Schreiber told Oliphant that Moores owned that account, which shared a link to another account code-named ""Britan,"" which Schreiber controlled.

""I find that the funds paid to Mr. Mulroney by Mr. Schreiber came from the Britan account; that the funds in the Britan account came from the Frankfurt account; and that the source of the funds in the Frankfurt account consisted of a portion of the commissions paid to Mr. Schreiber by Airbus Industrie,"" Oliphant wrote in his final report.

""For the reasons articulated in [the report's] Chapter 7, I find that the source of the funds paid by Mr. Schreiber to Mr. Mulroney was Airbus Industrie,"" he wrote.

Air Canada probe banned

However, Oliphant said there was nothing to prove that Mulroney knew where Schreiber's money came from.

""Based on the evidence adduced before me, it is impossible to conclude otherwise.""

The inquiry's terms barred it from looking into allegations that Mulroney and Schreiber were involved in a kickback scheme over the 1988 purchase of Airbus aircraft by Air Canada.

Oliphant noted that the fact Moores is dead made it difficult to determine the full nature of his role.

""He died in 2005, so it is impossible to verify Mr. Schreiber's evidence about the Frankfurt account with the only other person who is alleged to have been involved,"" Oliphant wrote.

Oliphant, Manitoba's associate chief justice, was appointed by the federal Conservative government in 2008 to examine widely reported revelations that Mulroney accepted cash-stuffed envelopes from Schreiber in the early 1990s.

Investigative journalists have long linked Moores to the Mulroney-Schreiber affair, although Moores vigorously denied that he had done anything wrong in the years before his cancer-related death in 2005.

Moores was named in a controversial 1995 letter that the RCMP had sent to Swiss authorities, asking for information about Mulroney. Although the letter was supposed to have been kept confidential, it was leaked to the media, sparking an explosive political firestorm.

Oliphant, who noted that no fraud charges were ever brought against Schreiber, Mulroney or Moores, also said Moores was not able to respond to allegations that Schreiber made about him.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979233741760254}",neutral,0.9979233741760254,0
Libya: More Than 100 Die in Airline Crash - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,"Wed, 12 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYWxsYWZyaWNhLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMTAwNTEyMDI1NC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than 100 people died at Tripoli's international airport when a flight from Johannesburg crashed while landing early Wednesday.

The airline operating the aircraft, Afriqiyah Airways, said in a statement posted to its website that flight 8U 771 had been in an accident at 6 am on Wednesday, Tripoli time. The flight left Johannesburg on Tuesday night.

""At this moment we have no information concerning possible casualties or survivors,"" the airline said.

However, Agence France-Presse reported an airport official in Tripoli as saying there was only one survivor of the crash - a Dutch boy who had been rushed to hospital. The airline said 93 passengers and 11 crew members had been on board.

The South African agents of the airline told Johannesburg's The Star newspaper that many of the passengers were South Africans who had been scheduled to fly on to London. Reuters quoted a security source in Tripoli as saying there had been 22 Libyans, including passengers and crew, on board.

The aircraft which crashed was an Airbus A330-200. Airbus said on its website that Afriqiyah Airways had taken delivery of its first A330-200 in August 2009.

The manufacturers, Airbus Industrie, said in a statement they would provide ""full technical assistance"" to those responsible for the investigation into the crash.

Afriqiyah Airways says on its website that it was founded to realize ""the dream of linking African countries directly with one another, hence the name Afriqiyah which stands for African, without the need to suffer through long connecting flights from Africa to Europe and then back to Africa.""

It says it began operations with five leased Airbus aircraft and signed a contract with Airbus in 2007 to buy 11 new planes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998682737350464}",neutral,0.9998682737350464,0

Television, citing official sources, reports say 104 passengers and crew were killed.

Airbus this morning in a statement confirmed the crash. “Airbus regrets to confirm that an Airbus A330-200 operated by Afriqiyah Airways was involved in an accident in Tripoli, Libya early today, Wednesday 12th May. The aircraft was arriving from Johannesburg, South Africa.

“In line with ICAO Annex 13 international convention, Airbus will provide full technical assistance to the Authorities responsible for the investigation into the accident through the Bureau d’Enquete et d’Analyse (BEA),” the statement says. “The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident of Afriqiyah Airways aircraft.”

The Associated Press adds Libyan state television showed footage of a large field scattered with small and large pieces of plane debris and dozens of police and rescue workers with surgical masks and gloves, some of them carrying at least one body away. Others sifted through the wreckage — some of it still smoldering — including a flight recorder and green seats with television screens on them. A large piece of the plane’s tail bearing the Afriqiyah brightly colored logo on it was visible, and other parts of the plane were in shreds. There was also a burnt, smashed car.

The Airbus A330 arriving from Johannesburg, South Africa was coming in to land when it crashed at around 6am. There was no immediate word on survivors or the cause, according to a statement by the airline posted on its website. “Afriqiyah Airways announces that our flight 771 had an accident during landing at Tripoli International airport,” the statement said. “At this moment, we have no information concerning possible casualties or survivors. Our information is that there were 93 passengers and 11 crew aboard. Authorities are conducting the search and rescue mission.

According to initial reports, the plane crashed as it neared the threshold of Tripoli International’s main east-west runway, while preparing to touch down from the east. Weather conditions over Tripoli’s international airport were good today, with three-mile (4.8-kilometer) visibility, scattered clouds at 10,000 feet and winds of only three miles per hour, The AP added.

In Johannesburg, Afriqiyah’s office said it was still trying to provide a breakdown of the nationality of passengers. It said the flight 771 left Johannesburg at 1am today.

Afriqiyah Airways operate an all Airbus fleet. It started its operations with five leased planes and then signed a contract with the Airbus Company during the Paris Flight Exhibition in 2007 for the purchase of 11 new planes including five Airbus A-320 and six A-350 models in addition to the right to purchase four further types of the same plane. It was founded in April 2001 and is fully owned by the Libyan government.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998173117637634}",neutral,0.9998173117637634,0
SAA orders five more Airbus A320 - defenceWeb,"Thu, 27 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2Uvc2FhLW9yZGVycy1maXZlLW1vcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African Airways (SAA) has ordered five additional Airbus A320 aircraft, increasing an earlier commitment for the type from 15 to 20. The aircraft will be delivered from 2013. Airbus, who made the announcement, did not disclose a value for the transaction.

The French news agency, Agence France Presse, reports however, that at “catalogue prices”, the five airliners would cost US$407 million dollars or 332 million euros.

SAA CE Siza Mzimela says the state-owned airline is “delighted that this transaction has the approval of our key stakeholders, the SAA Shareholder [government] and Board. Because they offers a seamless fit with the other Airbus aircraft types which we operate, the A320s will assist in our efficiency drive and reduce maintenance costs.”

The deal is in addition to a lease signed with Aircastle in March to lease six new A330-200 aircraft from February next year. These will replace SAA’s six A340-200s on a one-to-one basis.

The five additional A320 will augment the 15 SAA negotiated to acquire last year in settlement of a dispute with the French-based planemaker after a bungled attempt to cancel the purchase. The airliners had been part of a complex US3.5 bilion deal for 41 Airbus aircraft inked in March 2002 that included industrial offsets. International aviation publication Flightglobal reports SAA has received nine A340-600s, 11 A319s and six A340-300Es covered by the order, “but mistakenly believed it had cancelled the A320 portion.”

In 2008 SAA had to make a R727 million provision in its financial statements after Airbus demanded that it make pre-delivery payments on the aircraft and the airline found it was contractually bound to do so.

SAA stated in its annual report last year that it had increased the A320 order to 20 aircraft “at a total price that does not exceed the indicative value of the original order for 15 placed in 2002”, Flightglobal adds.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998414516448975}",neutral,0.9998414516448975,0
Airbus A330 Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 Crashes Killing All But One - AvStop Aviation News,"Thu, 13 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHA6Ly9hdnN0b3AuY29tL25ld3NfbWF5XzIwMTAvYWlyYnVzX2EzMzBfYWZyaXFpeWFoX2FpcndheXNfZmxpZ2h0Xzc3MV9jcmFzaGVzX2tpbGxpbmdfYWxsX2J1dF9vbmUuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Weather conditions above the airport were very poor at the time of the crash, said an Afriqiyah staff member. Low-hanging clowds had reduced visibility. Witnesses reported the aircraft broke apart while it was on its approach, ?it exploded on landing and totally disintegrated"". Officials have retrieved the two ?Black boxes.? Airbus has sent a team of investigators to the crash site to assist with determining the cause of the crash. An well known Irish writer, Bree O?Mara, author of ?Home Affairs? was reported to have been a passenger onboard. Afriqiyah Airways purchased the Airbus A330-202 back in September 2009. The aircraft was last serviced on March 5th by German airline Lufthansa and has only flown since that time 1,586 hours. The Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen reported the death toll numbers may drop because the numbers that have been reported are from the booking of passengers and not from the actual manifest of those who actually boarded the flight. Dutch child Ruben Vanassouw in Tripoli hospital It has been reported that 59 Dutch , 7 South Africans, 2 Libyans, 2 Austrians, 1 German, 1 Zimbabwean, 1 French, 2 British, 17 Unknown (to be notified upon confirmation), and 11 Crew members (Libyan nationalities) were onboard. Afriqiyah Airways is working together with the South African immigration and airport Authorities to determine the exact identities and nationalities of the passengers on board of flight 771. The Airbus A330 was cleared for runway 09. Due to poor weather conditions the aircraft should have been given runway 27, as this runway was equipped with and Instrument Landing System (ILS) said Benno Baksteen, a former pilot and chairs a Dutch aviation association. ""That would have made more sense. ?It would also have put them closer to the passenger terminal.""



It has been reported that a member of Afriqiyah Airways had stated ATC at Tripoli International Airport will typically direct morning aircraft arrivals to runway 09, regardless of wind direction and conditions. From the tower if aircraft are arriving to land on 27 the air traffic controllers have the rising sun from the east in their eyes and they prefer to avoid those conditions.



The lack of a fire upon impact could mean that the Airbus A330 was very low on fuel or ran out of fuel on its final approach. Several parts from fuselage was found behind the direction of the aircraft raising speculation that the Airbus may have done a cartwheel on impact which would suggest the pilot was in a bank rather than a level flight and may have attempted a go around just feet above the ground with the wing clipping the ground as the pilot was in a turn.



The National Transportation Safety Board is dispatching a team of investigators to assist the government of Libya in its investigation of an accident involving an Airbus A330- 200, which was equipped with General Electric CF6-8E1 engines. As the State of design and manufacture for the engines, NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman has designated Senior Air Safety Investigator, Lorenda Ward, as the U.S. Accredited Representative. The U.S. team will also include an NTSB engines specialist as well as technical advisors from the Federal Aviation Administration, and General Electric. The team is expected to arrive on Saturday afternoon.



The Bureau d'Enquete et d'Analyse (BEA) of France, representing the country of manufacture of the airplane, has also sent a team of investigators to Libya. The investigation is being conducted by the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority, which will release all information on the progress of the investigation.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7827120423316956}",negative,0.7827120423316956,-1
