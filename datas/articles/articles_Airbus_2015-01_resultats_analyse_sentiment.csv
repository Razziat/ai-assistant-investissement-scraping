"Now flying: The Airbus A350, the world's newest jetliner - USA TODAY","Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDEvMTUvbm93LWZseWluZy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1uZXdlc3QtamV0bGluZXIvMjE4MTI2ODMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now flying: The Airbus A350, the world's newest jetliner

It's official: Airbus' brand-new A350 widebody jet has become the newest aircraft to fly paying airline passengers.

Qatar Airways Flight 67 went into the record books Thursday as the first revenue flight to be flown on the A350, departing the airline's hub in Doha at 7:49 a.m. and landing in Frankfurt at 12:28 p.m., all times local. Qatar Airways is the global launch customer for the A350.

The A350 is likely to be last completely new aircraft to come online in the foreseeable future. Neither Boeing nor Airbus currently have any all-new models under way, meaning it could be a decade or longer until passengers see another all-new aircraft type produced by either of the world's two major jetmakers.

The A350 itself is the third all-new aircraft to be rolled out by either Airbus or Boeing during the past decade. It joins Airbus' superjumbo A380 – which debuted in 2007 – and Boeing's new-age 787 ""Dreamliner,"" which made its first flight for an airline in 2011.

In part, the A350 is Airbus' answer to Boeing's Dreamliner. Like the Dreamliner, the new A350 is made partially from lightweight carbon composite fibers that improve fuel efficiency and enhance comfort for passengers by allowing for things like larger windows and more comfortable pressurization and humidity levels.

Also like the Dreamliner, Airbus promises the jet will allow airlines to begin flying routes between cities that previously could not profitably support nonstop service.

Boeing's Dreamliner has delivered on that promise. United, for example, says its Dreamliners allowed it to add nonstop service between San Francisco and Chengdu, China. And British Airways used its Dreamliner to connect London and Austin, giving the Texas capital its first-ever regularly scheduled flight to Europe.

Both the A350 and 787 burn less fuel than other comparable widebody jets that fly long-haul routes. The A350 holds roughly 275 to 370 passengers, depending on the variant and how airlines choose to configure the aircraft.

Still, Airbus hopes its A350 eventually will compete not only against Boeing's Dreamliner, but also against Boeing's popular 777 model.

As for Qatar Airways, it has 79 more A350s on order.

""The delivery of this new aircraft category into the Qatar Airways' fleet ... is a moment of absolute national pride for Qatar Airways and the state of Qatar,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker said at an inauguration ceremony last week, according to The Associated Press.

Qatar Airways has configured its A350s to hold 283 seats, including 36 full-flat-bed business class seats and 247 in coach.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989390969276428}",neutral,0.9989390969276428,0
Successes in 2014 Prompt Airbus To Reduce Space Layoffs - SpaceNews,"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zdWNjZXNzZXMtaW4tMjAxNC1wcm9tcHQtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJlZHVjZS1wbGFubmVkLWxheW9mZnMtaW4tc3BhY2UtYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Defence and Space on Jan. 20 said its space division’s success in 2014 will allow the company to spare about 600 jobs that had been scheduled to disappear as part of a drive for savings in the search for higher operating margins.

The company also said it had received “lots of interest” from prospective buyers of its Vizada mobile satellite communications services division, whose nonmilitary activities have been put up for sale.

Airbus said its planned partnership with the European Space Agency to develop a business to speed data from Earth observation satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to users via laser optical links is stalled because its government partners have not signed a commitment to purchase the data as anchor customers.

Airbus Defence and Space was created in July 2014 from three Airbus divisions focusing on space technology, military aircraft and defense electronics.

The parent Airbus company said it would keep the space and defense business, but only if it streamlined its activities and reduced its focus to space systems, tactical missiles and military aircraft. The newly consolidated division plans to shutter 23 production sites and reduce its 38,000-strong workforce by 5,300 posts by 2017. Eight facilities were closed in 2014, and the company’s head count was reduced by about 1,000.

Of these 5,300 jobs to be eliminated, nearly 2,500 were in the space division. Airbus is a major satellite builder and is prime contractor for the Ariane 5 heavy-lift rocket as well as France’s M-51 strategic missile.

But with the success of the company’s satellite division and the prospects for more work on launch vehicles with the new Ariane 6 heavy-lift rocket entering the development phase, the company will ease its planned cuts by 600 positions, said Francois Auque, the head of Airbus’ space division.

In a briefing here, Auque said the company’s new product lines for Earth observation and telecommunications satellites had registered successes on the export markets in 2014, including Airbus’ win of a Peruvian optical reconnaissance satellite contract and is first-ever telecommunications satellite award from direct-broadcast satellite television EchoStar Corp. of Englewood, Colorado.

Airbus’ 2014 wins include two electric-propulsion satellites, for SES of Luxembourg and Eutelsat of Paris. The company expects to sign, by this spring, a contract with Eutelsat for the first Eutelsat Quantum satellite design, which is a step toward software-defined satellite payloads that can be configured from the ground.

In total, Airbus booked firm orders last year for four telecommunications satellites, plus an undisclosed telecommunications payload; and 10 Earth observation satellites including two optical reconnaissance satellites for the United Arab Emirates in a contract originally signed in 2013 but re-signed in 2014.

Airbus also contracted with the Korea Aerospace Research Institute to build the radar instrument for South Korea’s Kompsat-6 radar Earth observation satellite.

Auque confirmed recent statements by ESA that the EDRS-C laser data-relay satellite, which Airbus ordered from OHB AG of Bremen, Germany, as part of an Airbus-ESA partnership, may not be built unless ESA and the European Commission agree to a service level agreement involving use of the system.

The agreement would commit the government agencies to purchase from Airbus a minimum volume of EDRS laser-delivered Earth images coming from the European Commission’s Copernicus environment-monitoring program and its Sentinel series of satellites.

“The program is not certain,” Auque said. “It is a public-private partnership between the European Space Agency and industry in which industry invests and, in return, ESA must assure a minimum usage, and we also sell to third parties. To assure this minimal use, ESA needs a budget, a part of which is to be furnished by the European Commission. As of today this financing has not been confirmed. I still hope we can find an agreement.”

Auque said he remains a believer in EDRS, whose goal is to have at least three satellites spread out along the geostationary arc 36,000 kilometers over the equator to receive, by laser links, images from low-orbiting Earth observations satellites and to speed their delivery to ground users. Relaying data from unmanned aerial vehicles is also part of the business plan.

Auque also said the Vizada telecommunications service business, especially in maritime satellite communications where it resells Inmarsat mobile satellite capacity, is “extremely profitable,” but that its nonmilitary business no longer is viewed as core to Airbus.

“We don’t need Vizada to deliver commercial capacity to military customers,” Auque said. “So we’ll sell Vizada — I hope for more than we paid for it.”

Airbus purchased Vizada in late 2011 for $960 million, saying that the acquisition would report $660 million in 2011 revenue and $95 million in EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

"Falling Oil Prices, a Boon to Airlines, Pose a Challenge for Airbus and Boeing (Published 2015) - The New York Times","Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAxLzE0L2J1c2luZXNzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvZmFsbGluZy1vaWwtcHJpY2VzLWEtYm9vbi10by1haXJsaW5lcy1wb3NlLWEtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWZvci1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Sharply falling oil prices are a boon to airlines, saving billions of dollars in monthly fuel bills for a highly competitive industry that last year eked out an average profit of just $6 a passenger.

But what is good news for the airlines raises questions for the world’s largest jet makers, Boeing and Airbus, which have been riding a wave of demand for the latest fuel-efficient jets, driven in large part by the stubbornly high price of oil.

The concern is that the current drop in oil prices could prompt airlines to delay orders, after nearly a decade in which the aircraft makers have benefited from a boom in orders.

“What has propelled the market to record growth are two factors: cheap cash and expensive fuel,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in suburban Washington. “Now something has changed.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999098777770996}",negative,0.9999098777770996,-1
Boeing vs Airbus: How Did They Do in 2014? - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS9ib2VpbmctdnMtYWlyYnVzLTIwMTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the start of last year, we looked at the results of the 2013 deliveries between Airbus and Boeing. With all the interest in that article, I couldn’t leave it alone for 2014, right? So let’s take a look at how the two big airliner companies did, in what is really the biggest aviation competition around?

2014 was a big year for both Boeing and Airbus. Last year we saw the first delivery of the A350XWB for Airbus, while Boeing also had delivery of the first 787-9 to Air New Zealand (followed closely by ANA).

On the narrowbody front, the A320NEO had its first flight (don’t those engines look like someone strapped giant engines onto the wing and went ’œit will work, trust me’) and the 737 MAX makes it one step closer to rolling out of the Renton factory. There were plenty of orders made to both airliners, but what we really want to know is, who produced and sold the most aircraft?

Orders:

2014’s major air shows were held in Singapore and in the UK at Farnborough. Airbus brought the A350 to Singapore for one of its first appearances and, of course, so many of us remember the amazing flight display that the Boeing 787-9 did on the first day of Farnborough.

We are going to compare gross orders (since that’s what we used last year) between both wide- and narrow-body aircraft. On the Airbus side, wide-body covers the A380, A350XWB, and A330. For Boeing it would be the 777, 747-8, and the 787. Narrow-body for Airbus would be the A320 family of aircraft (covering both CEO & NEO options) while Boeing would include the whole range of 737 Aircraft (Next Gen & MAX).

Airbus’ wide-body sales had a good year, with a combined 251 aircraft across the A380, A330, and A350. Boeing’s total wide-body sales accounted for 354 aircraft. This is a high number of aircraft, with the total buoyed by the release of the 777X in late 2013.

However, on the narrow-body, stakes were dominated by Airbus, with 1,545 aircraft ordered and Boeing only able to sell just under 1,200 of their 737s.

ORDERS VICTOR: Airbus

Deliveries:

Looking at Airbus, they delivered just one A350, 30 A380s, and 108 A330s, for a total of 139 wide-body aircraft. The A330 is surely the Airbus cash cow at the moment in the twin-aisle market.

Boeing delivered six 767s (yes, these still run off the line, in either a freighter or passenger variant), 19 of their 747-8s, and 99 777s. By far the biggest shock was how many 787s they were able to deliver: 114 in 2014.

Boeing’s overall total for wide-bodies made them the leader with a total of 238 aircraft, just under 100 more than Airbus.

The narrow-body market is where the largest number of orders come from, and Boeing sure has received many of those orders over the years with the 737 family of aircraft.

Since the first 737 was delivered in 1968, there have been over 8,000 others that have followed suit.

Boeing delivered a total of 485 this year, just narrowly missing out to Airbus who delivered a total of 491 from the A320 family. The backlog of the single-aisle market alone is almost at 10,000 aircraft; we’ll see these planes being built for quite some time.

DELIVERY VICTOR: Boeing

2014 was a toss up again, with Boeing delivering more aircraft (due to a 787 production ramp up) while orders seemed to be far in favor of the European maker (especially for US-based airlines, with both American and Delta signing for extra aircraft from Airbus).

It is tough to tell what is going to happen in 2015, how either manufacturer can spur on future sales. But really with so many orders and deliveries in 2014, I think not only are Airbus and Boeing both victors, but also airlines and passengers.

Airbus A350: World's Newest Airliner Begins Commercial Flight - The Ledger,"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxlZGdlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNS8wMS8xNi9haXJidXMtYTM1MC13b3JsZHMtbmV3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVyLWJlZ2lucy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWZsaWdodC8yNzAyMTM2MDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350: World's Newest Airliner Begins Commercial Flight

DOHA, Qatar | The world's newest jetliner, the Airbus A350, took to the skies Thursday carrying its first paying passengers from the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar.

The Qatar Airways flight departed the Qatari capital of Doha in the morning and landed about 12:30 p.m. local time in Frankfurt, Germany. It marks the debut of the relatively lightweight, twin-aisle, long-range plane, which promises to connect smaller cities with major aviation hubs nonstop at a cheaper cost for airlines.

For passengers, the new plane offers wider panoramic windows and larger overhead storage space plus the ability to limit connections.

The A350 is the third — and final — major new aircraft in a decade. First there was the double-decker Airbus A380, which debuted in October 2007. It's the world's largest passenger jet, designed to carry up to 525 passengers between some of the largest cities on the planet.

Then came the lightweight Boeing 787, which carried its first passengers in October 2011. Thanks to its lower operating costs, the jet, marketed by Boeing as the Dreamliner, has led to new nonstop flights between cities that previously didn't have enough passengers to merit such service.

As with the Dreamliner, the A350's lightweight design allows it to burn significantly less fuel than other jets of similar size. A little more than half of the structure is made of composite materials such as plastic reinforced by carbon fibers. Add in titanium and advanced alumi- num alloys, and more than 70 percent of the plane is made up of lightweight materials.

Airbus says the A350 will help open up nonstop routes like Shanghai to Boston, Mass., or Paris to Santiago, Chile.

The A350 can fly 276 to 369 passengers, depending on the variant and the airline's choice of seating configuration.

Qatar's version is fitted out with 36 business class seats that turn into fully flat beds and boast 17-inch TV screens, and an economy class section with 247 seats and smaller TVs.

The state-backed airline has put considerable faith in the new model, with orders for 79 more planes. It received its first double-decker A380 from the European plane maker in Septem­ber.

""The delivery of this new aircraft category into the Qatar Airways fleet ... is a moment of absolute national pride for Qatar Airways and the state of Qatar,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker said at an inauguration ceremony last week.

Qatar Airways' larger Gulf rival, the Dubai-based Emirates, also had plans to operate the A350. But it scrapped an order for 70 of the planes last June after what it said was a ""fleet requirement"" review.

Unlike the Dreamliner, which was grounded in early 2013 for 3½ months because of problems with its lithium-ion batteries, Airbus — at this point — has decided to forgo lithium-ion technology on the A350 in favor of traditional but heavier batteries.

So far, Boeing has secured more orders for its 787, but the program had a head start on Airbus, which was focusing on its colossal A380.

Boeing has 1,071 orders for its 787, with 228 of the jets now in service around the world. Airbus has 778 orders for the A350 from 41 different airlines and jet leasing companies including, British Airways, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. The plane that flew to Frankfurt Thursday is the first of 80 such jets that quickly growing Qatar has ordered.

A larger version of the jet, which is scheduled to start flying in 2017, aims to compete with Boeing's long-range 777-300.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999358654022217}",neutral,0.9999358654022217,0
Airbus calls for new black box safety measures - CNBC,"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDEvMTMvYWlyYnVzLWFubm91bmNlcy0xNDU2LW5ldC1vcmRlcnMtaW4tMjAxNC5odG1s0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTUvMDEvMTMvYWlyYnVzLWFubm91bmNlcy0xNDU2LW5ldC1vcmRlcnMtaW4tMjAxNC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Chief Operating Officer for Customers John Leahy said the group is urging airlines to adopt new black box safety measures following the December crash of a Airbus A320 plane flying on the AirAsia Flight QZ8501.

French aircraft manufacturer Airbus has pushed for new measures on how an airplane's ""black box"" is recovered in an emergency, following what has been one of the worst year's for flight safety in recent memory.

""We have a plan for the airplane gets into trouble to eject the black box out of the aircraft and on the surface of the water, it would float with its pinging radio signal and allow it to be found very very quickly rather than sinking to the bottom, where it could be miles deep in the ocean in some wreckage somewhere,"" Leahy told CNBC.

""We think this should be adopted by all certification authorities around the world, I think the airlines will find it very useful as well,"" he added.



The black box, or flight data recorder contains detailed information about the aircraft's operation and route. Divers from the Indonesian navy have found one of black boxes and the cockpit voice recorder from the AirAsia plane that fell from the sky that killed 162 people, which should shed light on how the aircraft crashed.

""Accidents will inevitably happen, people are human, machines are machines,"" Leahy said.

""Safety is our number one priority and to make airplanes safe, as they say the most dangerous part of your trip is the drive to the airport. But when an accident does happen, we need to know what happened, why it happened and that's the black box, it is recording all the parameters of the aircraft.""

Airbus managed to cling to the top spot in commercial plane orders, confirming it outsold Boeing last year, while failing to close a gap in deliveries that leaves its U.S. rival as the world's largest plane manufacturer for the third year running.

The unexpected lead in aircraft orders, which confirms a Reuters report last week, comes after an unprecedented surge that saw the planemaker book over 400 plane orders in December.

Airbus won 1,456 net orders in 2014, down from 1,503 a year earlier but enough to pass Boeing's total of 1,432.

The Airbus Group unit delivered a company record of 629 aircraft in 2014, up slightly from 626 a year earlier but lagging behind Boeing's industry high of 723.

Total deliveries by the two plane giants rose 6 percent to a record 1,352 aircraft, reflecting fleet renewals and the rapid growth of Asia as an aviation hub. But some analysts say demand may have peaked as plummeting oil prices - although good for most airlines - reveal broader economic concerns.

Leahy shrugged off oil price concerns, adding that lower fuel prices ""definitely helps"" as it enables airlines to make more money.

""When they make more money, they accelerate their fleet plans,"" he said.

""In Asia, a lot of people are just moving into into the middle class – they haven't been on an aircraft – and now they are being told that they could take an aircraft for business, they like it they have a bit of disposable income and they want to take their family on a plane instead of a train. This demand is enormous and it is being met by these low cost carriers.The number of middle class people in this region is growing exponentially over the next 10 to 20 years and they want to fly,"" he added,

Deliveries of the A320 narrow-body jet family, which generates much of Airbus's cash, slipped to 490 aircraft from 493 a year earlier but trumped deliveries of the Boeing 737 range, ending a deficit seen between January and November.



Airbus delivered 30 A380 superjumbos, a model whose future direction has been left uncertain as the company tries to win sales.

Airbus Helicopter Looks to Polish Tender - Defense News,"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAxLzI3L2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWxvb2tzLXRvLXBvbGlzaC10ZW5kZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Helicopters last month submitted its offer in Poland's tender for 70 military multirole helicopters and expects a short list to be selected in February, Chairman Guillaume Faury said Tuesday.

The Polish competition is a ""strategic opportunity"" and Airbus has ""good chances,"" Faury told journalists at the New Year's press conference.

Airbus Helicopters has pitched its EC725 Caracal against the Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk and AgustaWestland AW149. Each of the competitors has signed with a local partner for production.

Airbus will open a design office in Poland on Feb.19, and work will go on there independent of the tender, Faury said.

Poland also has a requirement for some 30 combat helicopters, for which Airbus will pitch its Tiger, Executive Vice President Dominique Maudet said.

Airbus Helicopters expects a business ""stabilization"" in 2015 and some large defense deals in the market.

Other major prospects this year include a tender for South Korea's light civil helicopter and light armed helicopter, and signing a contract for the NH90 transport helicopter for Qatar and the Caracal for Kuwait.

Mexico is seen as a potential market for the Caracal, with the Tiger less of a priority. Brazil has had to reschedule production of the Caracal because of budget problems but that has been ""stabilized,"" Maudet said.

The NH90 order book has been cut by 33 units, as Portugal canceled an order for 10 NH90s and Spain slimmed its order to 22 from 45 units. Spain has amended the contract to receive spares and logistical support for the helicopters for the three services rather than just the Army.

Lebanon has a requirement for seven Super Puma and some light Gazelle helicopters, as part of an arms order agreed with France and funded by Saudi Arabia.

Airbus Helicopters reports 2014 progress amid changing market dynamics - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcHRlcnNyZXBvcnRzMjAxNHByb2dyZXNzYW1pZGNoYW5naW5nbWFya2V0ZHluYW1pL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters had a backlog of 900 helicopters at the end of 2014. While that’s 100 fewer helicopters than in 2013, there is a higher number of larger helicopter types, like the EC225, that are on order than over the previous year. Anthony Pecchi Photo

Guillaume Faury presented Airbus Helicopters’ 2014 results on Jan. 27 in Paris, for the second time during his tenure as CEO. Going from Eurocopter to Airbus Helicopters is “not only a change in name, but also a project to change the company, and fully integrate it into Airbus Group,” said Guillaume Faury, introducing the press conference.

The Airbus Helicopters CEO was quick to point out that 2014 had been a busy year, with three new helicopters certified, delivered and pressed into service: the EC135 T3/P3, the EC145 T2 and the much-awaited EC175, with the first two production aircraft delivered to Noordzee Helikopters Vlaanderen (NHV) and the third to UTair.

Last year, Airbus Helicopters delivered 471 helicopters, the lowest figure since 2006, when Eurocopter reached a low of 381. Two years later, in 2008, the company reached a staggering high of 588. Since 2010, the company hovers around the 500 delivery mark and a stable market share: 44 percent on the civil and parapublic market in terms of aircraft delivered (a result equal to Bell, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky combined) and 11 percent on the military market, behind Sikorsky, Russian Helicopters and Boeing.

Beyond the raw figure, the good news for Airbus Helicopters and its cash flow is the significant shift in the business — fewer light singles delivered and more (expensive) heavies. Airbus Helicopters delivered 53 NH90s last year, and 48 aircraft from the Super Puma/EC225 and EC725 family. On the booking side, Airbus Helicopters raked in 402 orders (see the breakdown).

Breakdown of bookings by product family for 2014. Airbus Helicopters Graphic Faury also highlighted a strong order backlog, reaching 900 helicopters at the end of 2014. That’s 100 lower than at the end of 2013, but once again heavies are replacing smaller and cheaper light singles. After a much-awaited certification in early 2014, Airbus Helicopters is expecting to reap the dividends of its effort with the EC175. Only eight of the model were sold in 2014, but Airbus Helicopters is counting on the aircraft’s very satisfying entry-into-service (85 percent availability from day one with NHV, with a strong tempo of operations) to clear commercial turbulence and convince future customers. However, the EC175 is now facing two hurdles: the uncertain situation in Russia and the drop in oil prices. Russian customer UTair, which received its first EC175 late last year, is experiencing difficulties in a weak economy and is putting further EC175 deliveries on hold, “waiting for more clarity,” said Faury. Meanwhile, when asked about the commercial impact of the drop in crude oil and natural gas prices, the CEO noted that 15 percent of Airbus Helicopters’ business comes from the oil and gas business, with a market share of 25 percent. “On a short term, lots of projects can be frozen and affect our sales, but on the other hand, weak prices can be an opportunity for our flagships like the EC175 and the new EC225e, which bring very effective cost solutions for long-range operations,” he said.



Faury remains optimistic for 2015, which he said will bring some important opportunities for Airbus Helicopters with major government campaigns (which were comparatively lacking in 2014, translating into below-average sales figures). Decisions are expected in Poland (which is seeking to procure 70 multi-mission helicopters), Korea (which is seeking a foreign partner for a Light Commercial Helicopter and Light Armed Helicopter) and Kuwait (which has a need for 24 transport helicopters). Winning one or more of these campaigns will help Airbus Helicopters maintain its backlog for heavy helicopters at a satisfactory level. A fourth major campaign, held in Qatar, should bring some good news soon, since Doha signed a letter of intent in March 2014 for 22 NH90s. The contract, which is said to be in the final negotiation phase, could be signed in the coming weeks.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997290968894958}",neutral,0.9997290968894958,0
"Airbus and Boeing 2014: the rain of orders and deliveries continues, with no sign of slackening | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Thu, 08 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLTIwMTQtdGhlLXJhaW4tb2Ytb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWNvbnRpbnVlcy13aXRoLW5vLXNpZ24tb2Ytc2xhY2tlbmluZy0yMDI5NznSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing's very, very good year

For 2014, Boeing had 1550 gross orders, and 118 cancellations, for a net total of 1432, a new record for the company, surpassing the 1413 orders achieved in 2007. Boeing had a particularly successful December, adding 174 new orders, including 20 777s and 16 787s.

Boeing 2014 orders by type

Boeing had particular success with narrowbodies in 2014, logging 1196 gross orders, including 891 of the new 737 MAX, 302 of the 737 NG family and three Boeing Business Jets.

This is the third consecutive year that orders for Boeing's 737 family will have topped 1000 aircraft. Better than half of Boeing's 737 orders for the year have come from 'unidentified customer(s)', including 174 in 4Q2014.

Boeing 737 orders: 2006 to 2014

Boeing's 737 MAX order backlog is now in the region of 2600 aircraft, representing better than five years of production, even at the current record output of 48 per month. Combined with the 737 NG order book of nearly 1700 aircraft, and Boeing's 737 family order book totals more than eight years of output.

737 NG and 737 MAX unfilled orders

To deal with the excessive backlog, Boeing is increasing production over the next four years. The first aircraft at the new build rate of 42 per month was rolled out in Mar-2014. This will be raised to 47 per month in 2017 and then to 52 per month. Output was just 31.5 aircraft per month in 2010. This is putting pressure on its suppliers, as well as its own manufacturing capabilities, as Boeing is concurrently developing its Renton production facility with a third, 737 MAX-dedicated assembly line.

777 orders for the year were 281. Boeing launched the 777X family at the end of 2013 and the new aircraft did particularly well in 2014, securing 224 of Boeing's orders for the family. Existing customers also continue to line up for the 777-300ER, which accounted for the entirety of non-777X orders for Boeing this year.

Boeing intends to keep 777 production at 8.3 aircraft per month/100 per year out to the switch over between the current generation and the 777X. This means Boeing still has to sell around 230 current generation 777s over the next five years to bridge the production gap, with the 777X due to enter service around 2020.

As airlines update their fleets and leasing companies see opportunities to plug gaps in the market, the 777-300ER continues to accumulate small orders. Boeing anticipates sales of 40-50 aircraft per year, which would allow it to avoid any output cut. There are risks though. If current generation 777 orders dry up or the 777X programme runs into development troubles - something that happens with distressing regularity with modern aircraft, even with re-works of existing airframes - then Boeing will have a very difficult time maintaining production at current levels.

New orders for the 787 were few and far between for Boeing, particularly in the first half of the year. Momentum picked up in 2H2014, particularly in the last four months. Boeing logged 65 orders, although this was cut back to 51 after cancellations. Leasing companies have proved to be the chief customers for the Dreamliner this year, with Avolon ordering six, CIT Leasing taking 12 and MG Aviation ordering two. All Nippon Airways became a repeat customer, with an order for 14 to round out its fleet and large orders for 15 and 14 aircraft were placed by unidentified customers in Sep-2014 and Dec-2014.

Apart from a single VIP 787-8 ordered in the beginning of the year, all the orders placed in 2014 have been for the larger 787-9. With its extra range and capacity for around 40 more passengers, the variant has proved to be the most popular of the family for several years. It has been around 12 months since Boeing secured a commercial airline order for the 787-8 or the 787-10.

Boeing 787 aircraft orders, deliveries and backlog, year to 31-Dec-2014

The sole cloud on Boeing's horizon has been the 747-8 programme. Boeing received just two 747-8 orders this year, and these were neutralised by other customers dropping orders.

19 747-8s were delivered in 2014 and Boeing announced earlier in Dec-2014 that output will fall from 1.5 to 1.3 aircraft per month from Sep-2015. With airlines reluctant to buy large, 4-engine aircraft, global cargo markets still soft and airfreight suffering structural issues, the market for the aircraft has almost dried up. Boeing (and Airbus as well) is hopeful that there is still a role for the very large aircraft, but with large, high efficiency twins now offering capacity in the 350-450 seat range, there are fewer and fewer route pairs where these aircraft are the best choice to operate.

For the year, Boeing delivered 723 aircraft.

This includes delivery records for the 737 (485 aircraft), 777 (99 aircraft) and the 787 (114) aircraft. This was in line with Boeing's forecast of 715-723 aircraft. The 787 deliveries will have been particularly satisfying for Boeing, after the continuing issues with production at its South Carolina manufacturing campus. Boeing achieved a one month record for 787 deliveries in Dec-2014, managing to get 34 aircraft to customers and beat its target of 110 for the year.

Boeing annual deliveries

With 737 and 787 production both set to continue to build, Boeing will be delivering record numbers of aircraft for the foreseeable future. Expectations for deliveries for 2015 are 750-760 aircraft, meaning Boeing will have doubled output over the space of seven years, and will be producing better than two aircraft per day.

With its strong commercial sales and deliveries position, Boeing is confident and looking to boost shareholder value. Boeing bought back USD6 billion in shares in 2014 and announced a new USD12 billion share buyback in Dec-2014, replacing the previous scheme, of which approximately USD4.8 billion was remaining. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to USD0.91 per share.

Airbus slipped a little behind in orders and production, but may make a late burst

Airbus is expected to outsell Boeing in terms of orders in 2014, despite only having logged significantly fewer orders by the end of Nov-2014. Airbus usually finalises a large number of orders late in the year, with the final few weeks of December turning into a '13th month' for the company.

Airbus has a similar number of gross orders to Boeing, with 1,328 to the end of Nov-2014. It has been hit much harder by order cancellations this year - mostly for A320s, but also for the A350 (70 orders cancelled by Emirates, in an almost unprecedented move for the financially healthy carrier) and the A380 (six cancelled by the troubled Skymark Airlines). These 297 cancellations cut Airbus net order total to 1031, although the company has announced another 140-odd orders since the beginning of Dec-2014.

Orders aside, Airbus will be well behind Boeing in deliveries, with the manufacturer expected to only marginally better its target of matching 2013 deliveries of 626. For the year to the end of Nov-2014, Airbus had delivered 564 aircraft.

2014 was a key year for Airbus to deliver on new aircraft programmes. It is putting the A350 XWB - which will be the mainstay of the company's widebody offering for the next 15-20 years - in to hands of launch customer Qatar Airways on 22-Dec-2014. It also made clear progress with the A320neo, which is due for entry into service, also with Qatar Airways as launch customer, around Oct-2015.

The A320 programme continues to be a star performer for Airbus. For the year to the end of Nov-2014, Airbus logged 970 narrowbody orders, comprising 752 for the A320neo and 218 for the A320ceo. This essentially fills the remaining production slots for the A320ceo.

Like Boeing, Airbus has a massive backlog of orders for its narrowbody aircraft. Airbus has 4832 outstanding A320 family orders, 3761 for the A320neo family and 1071 for the A320ceo.

Airbus A320 family order backlog as of end of Nov-2014

Airbus' approach to narrowing its order backlog isn't as aggressive as Boeing, at least not yet. A320 production has been steady at 42 per month since 4Q2012. Airbus' production year is effectively about 11.5 months, meaning its narrowbody output is only a little ahead of Boeing's.

Airbus plans to raise production to 46 aircraft per month - around 525-530 per year - by 2Q2016. Further increases towards the latter part of the decade are under consideration, although Airbus is likely to introduce them along with the A320neo production ramp up, set for 2018 and beyond.

A320 narrowbody family annual production

In early 2014, the company stepped back from plans to raise narrowbody output to 50 per month, or beyond, mostly due to concerns about the fragility of its supply chain. With three A320 assembly facilities operating, and a fourth - the new Alabama final assembly line - due to join in production in 2015, Airbus has the production capacity available to raise production to beyond 50 per month, should it see the necessity and requisite strength in the supply chain.

The ongoing process of aerospace consolidation in Europe and the US, particularly the acquisition of smaller tier two and tier three suppliers by bigger tier one corporations, may help Airbus over the next few years, although potentially at the cost of some pricing controls.

Even as Airbus and Boeing demanded high production levels, both major manufacturers have been pressuring suppliers, particularly smaller manufacturers, for lower prices. At higher output levels, quality control problems have been apparent for several major component makers, on both sides of the Atlantic. Airbus and Boeing have taken action, expanding their relationships with suppliers to include more direct feedback and supervision.

One area Airbus has lagged Boeing has been in widebody sales. The launch of the A330neo in Jul-2014, gave the Airbus widebody product line up a boost, albeit one with less capacity diversity that Boeing's. It will also ensure the A330 will stay in production beyond 2030.

Airbus' decision to launch the A330neo programme at the Farnborough Airshow ended nearly two years of speculation about the aircraft. Airbus quickly garnered 121 commitments, of which it had confirmed 40 by the end of Nov-2014. Several major customers, including AirAsia X (55), CIT Aerospace (15), Avolon (15) and Hawaiian Airlines (eight) have firmed up their orders during Dec-2014, taking orders above 130 for the year.

In addition, Airbus has logged 41 orders for the A330ceo this year. Airbus plans to certify the new A330 'Regional' variant - targeting medium-haul customers in Asia Pacific - and a version with higher maximum take-off weight offering an extra 350-500 nm range in 2015.

Despite these developments, Airbus has already announced that it will be making production cuts to the A330 programme - both in 4Q2015 and again in 2016 - to resolve its production gap to the A330neo, which is due to enter service in late 2017.

Airbus has a firm backlog of 215 A330s, a little under two years production at present rates. Output for A330 is at a record 10 per month, a testament to the popularity of the mature platform and the scramble for high efficiency twin-jets among airlines.

A330 annual output

The cut to A330 production will have a negative effect on Airbus' cash flows for 2016 and 2017, but as the A330neo enters production, rates will build up again. Airbus sees the cut as necessary to ensure that its supply chain has good visibility on their requirements as they move towards the A330neo production ramp up.

A330ceo production will be dropped down again beyond 2017, while A33neo production will be built up, and could eventually stabilise at better than the current rate of 10 per month rate.

Airbus transition plans from ceo to neo

Airbus celebrated the first A350 delivery in 2014 - albeit with a little difficulty and just before the close of the year - but orders have not been particularly impressive. Airbus suffered a high profile cancellation of 70 A350 from Emirates earlier in the year, after the Middle East carrier reviewed its fleet plan, not to mention ordering 150 Boeing 777Xs. The A350 gained some order momentum towards the end of the year, grabbing orders from Delta Air Lines, All Nippon Airways, Finnair and Air Mauritius, but its tally is still nearly 30 to the negative for the year.

Another widebody suffering order cancellations was the A380, with Skymark Airlines cancelling its order for six. The big Airbus widebody has gathered just one order this year, for 20 aircraft from leasing company Amedo.

With a backlog of around 170 aircraft, production at about 2.5 aircraft per month/30 per year and better than 40% of orders concentrated with a single customer, the A380 remains in something of a precarious position. Airbus expects to achieve break-even for the programme in 2015, and there are delivery positions for the aircraft out to 2022, but speculation on the future of the programme has been plentiful.

Emirates, which has ordered 140 A380s, has been pressing for a 'neo' version of the aircraft. With the A350-1000, A330neo and A320neo all in development, it is uncertain whether Airbus has the resources to commit to a development programme prior to 2017-2018. Airbus would need a solid business case before committing to putting new engines on the aircraft and making other improvements, which would likely require investment of more than EUR2 billion. A further stretch is also an option, but also an expensive, long-term one that appeals to a very limited number of customers.

Airbus believes in the long-term future of the A380, and has partially blamed its own marketing efforts for the lack of sales, a position some A380 customers share. In order to broaden the aircraft's appeal, Airbus is working with customers to offer higher density configurations, maturing the aircraft away from the luxury-oriented fleet flagship and into a medium and long-haul workhorse. Fully half of all A380 customers offer densities under 500 seats, but newer users have typically offered higher capacities than initial operators.

2015 will be another year focused on delivery for Airbus - it will bring its minor A330 updates and the A320neo to the market this year, and will also need to show progress on the A350-1000 and A330neo, both of which are due to enter service in 2017. Beyond this, Airbus may look to more ambitious programmes.

Declining fuel prices won't dampen enthusiasm

2014 proved to be a year that exceeded the expectations of the manufacturers. Both manufacturers successfully brought new products to customers and have kept production levels up, keeping airlines and investors happy. Aircraft deliveries have climbed for the fifth consecutive year, driven by the burgeoning of aviation in Asia Pacific.

Global fleet deliveries by region: 2005-2014

Initial order projections for 2014 were exceeded, revised and then exceeded again. Globally, large commercial aircraft orders in 2014 exceeded 2000 for the fourth year running. The challenges for Airbus and Boeing for 2015 and the few years beyond are about executing new programmes and bringing them to market, rather than winning orders.

With oil prices dipping below USD50 per barrel in the early stages of 2015, questions are being raised as to whether the decline in fuel prices will also cut the demand for aircraft. Fuel is typically 40-50% of airline cost, but it is not fuel efficiency alone that is driving demand for new aircraft.

US NYMEX oil price per barrel (USD): 2014

Passenger traffic growth set to continue above the long term trend of 5.5% p/a - particularly in long-haul markets - so airlines are adding capacity to their fleets to accommodate this anticipated demand. New aircraft also bring other benefits apart from better fuel efficiency - lower maintenance burden, higher capacity, less noise, greater range and better utilisation.

Airbus expects that dropping fuel cost will contribute to airline profitability in 2015, freeing up funds to invest in new equipment. In combination with this, the liquidity position of commercial aircraft financial markets is in the best shape seen since the financial crisis. Export credit usage has returned to pre-crisis levels and traditional commercial bank debt and the capital markets have been augmented by alternative sources, creating a more balanced and diverse market place.

Economics is the underlying force that will determine growth

As always, there are downside risks. Social and political unrest, health crises and interest rate and currency fluctuations all have the potential to damage the outlook.

The underlying picture for passenger traffic, and thus aircraft demand, is supported by generally robust economic growth, forecast record airline profitability and the long-term aircraft replacement cycle, maintaining the strength of the market.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Airbus Thinks Its New A321LR Will Be Able to Replace the 757 – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMTUvMDEvMTUvYWlyYnVzLXRoaW5rcy1pdHMtbmV3LWEzMjFsci13aWxsLWJlLWFibGUtdG8tcmVwbGFjZS10aGUtNzU3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 737 and A320 families have grown a lot since they were launched, both in number of orders and in size. But while they’ve been able to handle most missions an airline might want, there’s always been a niche that they’ve never been able to handle. In fact, that niche of longer-haul segments with lower demand, has been what’s kept the 757 so popular in recent years. But now, Airbus says it has an answer. The A321LR was just launched with an order for 30.

When the 757 launched, it was designed to be a replacement for the 727. Two efficient engines instead of three meant lower fuel burn and big cost savings. The airplane did well and became a staple on shorter-haul routes pretty much everywhere. But eventually, the 737 and A320 families came to kill it.

Airbus first extended the A320 into the A321 for its first flight in 1994. It was a flop. Like Boeing did with the 757, Airbus got lazy and simply stretched the A320 without trying to improve range. The end result was a bigger airplane but one that couldn’t go very far. Airbus fairly quickly realized its error and started adding on range. Meanwhile, Boeing actually did the same thing on the 737-900. The first one flew in 2001 but it had short range and wasn’t popular.

It didn’t take long for Boeing and Airbus to both see the opportunity. Both of them added fuel tanks and extended range. At the same time, airlines began realizing that this was great on two levels so they started buying in droves.

On one hand, the 737-900ER and the A321 were bigger than the 737-800 and A320 but didn’t add much cost. So the cost per seat? Yeah, it came down a lot. Airlines really liked those economics and started buying big. US Airways and American (pre-merger) went for the A321. United and Alaska went for the 737-900ER. Delta, in true Delta fashion, went with both. (Southwest, which only flew the 737-700, upgauged to the 737-800 but hasn’t gone bigger… yet.) These started to become the most desirable narrowbodies flying.

While they liked the economics of the stretched airplane, there was another benefit. The 737-900ER and the A321 could be replacements for the aging 757 fleet. They were more efficient airplanes and they had commonality with the rest of the narrowbody fleet. It was perfect. The 757s started to disappear on domestic routes that could easily be served by these other airplanes.

But the 757 is a special airplane that has a lot of fantastic capabilities. While it could be replaced on most domestic routes, it couldn’t be replaced everywhere. See, the 757 can carry a full load a long way. That made it perfect for longer routes that didn’t have the demand for a widebody like the 767.

In the US, airlines realized that the 757 was perfect for routes like Hawai’i and short Transatlantic as well as some mid-haul Latin America flights. And there was nothing else that could replace it. Sure, some 737s could make it from the far west coast to Hawai’i but that was about it. And it wasn’t easy. It also wasn’t the bigger 737-900 that could do it. There was no substitute in the same size category for the 757.

When Airbus came out with the A320neo and Boeing the 737MAX, the gap started the close. Airbus can’t get any narrowbodies from the West Coast to Hawai’i today. That changes with the neo. But still, none of these airplanes would be able to carry enough people far enough to replace the 757.

Finally, Airbus has made the decision to try to rectify the situation. The A321LR will be an A321neo with extra fuel tanks in the belly. That will give the airplane almost as many seats as the 757 (almost), and it can fly 4,000nm (give or take). That’s plenty to serve the 757 mission, if it actually works as planned.

People are already tearing into the specs to see if it can actually do what it says. Leehman News is all over this. The A321LR should be able to operate for three quarters the cost of a 757, which is quite the improvement.

But once it rolls off the line, can it actually take ~165 people that far? What if airlines want a higher density layout? And can it carry any cargo? (Probably not.) The first order is from Steven Udvar-Hazy’s leasing company, and he will absolutely punish them if it doesn’t live up to expectations. So chances are, this may be the beginning of the end for the 757. But let’s wait and see before writing the airplane’s obituary.

Quoting sources close to the negotiations, Romania's inCont news site says as part of the deal, Airbus will buy back Tarom's existing fleet of four A318-100s, two A310-300s, four B737-300s, and four B737-700s with its sole B737-800 to be returned to its lessor.

In return, Airbus will arrange the requisite financing and, once all details are finalized, will this year begin re-equipping the Romanian national carrier with eight A319-100s, four A320-200s, two A321-200s, and two A330s. There are also plans to replace Tarom's fleet of seven ATR42-500s and two ATR72-500s with -600 variants of both types.

As an interim measure, Airbus will lease Tarom a fleet of jets, no older than 5 years of age, while its actual aircraft are undergoing assembly.

The actual agreement, which is still subject to finalization between the airline's board and the Romanian Ministry of Transport, has taken on a degree of urgency given the growth of budget carriers such as Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) and Blue Air (Romania) (BLA, Bucharest Henri Coanda) in the region as well as Air Serbia (JU, Belgrade) in the full-service sector.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
A321neo configurations and A320 production - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS8xOC9hMzIxbmVvLWNvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb25zLWFuZC1hMzIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

18 Jan 2015: As part of the preparations for the Airbus A321LR article 15 Jan. we saw a need to clarify with Airbus the production configurations for A321neo. There had been several iterations of what will be produced come mid-2018 when the A321neo variant is scheduled to roll off the FALs at Airbus in an enhanced Airbus Cabin-Flex (ACF) variant.

This variant features a three-door pairs layout that allows a raised max passenger limit by virtue of displaced door three and an addition of a second overwing exit. Recent media articles have suggested that both the initial four-door variant as well as the three-door variant would be available.

When we were briefed by Airbus in October on what today is launched as A321LR we were told this variant would be built with the enhanced ACF fuselage. Further we were told there would only be one structural version of the aircraft incorporating the 97t versions structural enhancements. This then raises the question, would Airbus produce two variants of A321neo?

We have now got the answer from Airbus. First our question: Is the four-door fuselage still orderable in A321neo version come 2018?

Airbus: We can offer the four-door configuration for the A321neo if the market requires it. There are today more than 1,000 A321s in service and more than 2,300 have been ordered. So the four-door A321 fleet will be very important by 2018. But there are a lot of benefits associated to A321neo ACF, including full cabin layout flexibility, so our customers will move to ACF progressively as it becomes available.

The AFC mentioned here is Airbus Cabin Flex, the new fuselage concept that Airbus has made to allow the A321neo to carry up to 240 passenger, Figure 1. It deletes the second door pair, moves the third doors further back and offers up to two overwing exits.

Figure 1. Airbus Cabin-Flex, ACF, for A321neo. Source: Airbus.

The answer from Airbus clarifies that ACF or Airbus Cabin-Flex will then be the new standard for A321neo going forward from 2018 as it brings several advantages. It enables a larger exit limit of up to 240 passenger when operators orders it with the second overwing exit. It also does away with the second doors just ahead of the wing, which in practice divides the aircraft in an often to cramped premium section between doors one and two. With doors two eliminated, the operator has larger freedom where to stop any premium cabin and start the next cabin segment.

Figure 2 show A321neo Cabin-Flex with an all economy layout compared to the traditional A321neo four-door layout which will be the initial production version from 2016.

A321LR will be available 2019 and then the AFC fuselage will have been in production a year. As we were briefed, the A321LR will only be offered in this version of the fuselage.

We were told that the elimination of door two brings such weight advantages that the extra strengthening of the A321LR structure that will be necessary will not increase the the aircraft’s empty weight compared to a four-door variant. Airbus can thereby rationalize the build standard for A321neo so that for AFC versions there will only be one version of the aircraft which has the stronger LR structure for all variants of A321neo.

A320 production rates.

Airbus also told us Tuesday they will keep the production rate steady at 42 per month over the ongoing transition from ceo to neo. As the A320neo production increases the combined ceo and neo production will ramp to 46 per month during 2016. The total cross over from ceo to neo will take three years, i.e. into 2017.

As Airbus has more visibility how this cross over will work they will take a decision to ramp the production further, said Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier. This visibility and therefore decision could come later in 2015, as Airbus has realized they need to increase production to cope with the backlog of orders. “But right now is not the time for such a decision,” according to Bregier. “The sensitive supply chain shall be left to do the ceo to neo crossover without disturbances.”

Our sources in the supply chain indicate that Airbus has alerted them to be ready to go to 54/mo in 2018.

Botswana’s Police Service has signed for a contract for three new Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3e Ecureuils for its Police Air Support Branch.

The new helicopters will be customized to the Botswana Police Service’s specification, including the installation of night vision equipment for night-time operations and other law enforcement equipment. The start of delivery of the new aircraft is scheduled for later in 2015.

The additional helicopters with their enhanced capability will fulfill Botswana’s requirement for an expanded airborne law enforcement and crime prevention force.

Airbus Helicopters Southern Africa general manager, Arnaud Montalvo, said: “We are proud to continue our relationship with the Botswana Police Air Support Unit and that it has selected the AS350 B3e, which has a proven pedigree in police missions — especially in hot and high conditions typical of the much of Botswana. We are confident these aircraft will make an enormous contribution to safeguarding the citizens of Botswana and their property.”

In addition to the helicopters, Airbus Helicopters will also train Botswana Police Air Support Branch pilots and mechanics.

The AS350 B3e is a member of Airbus Helicopters rugged and proven Ecureuil family and was selected for its unmatched performance and efficiency in Botswana’s typically hot and high elevation conditions. Its Turbomeca Arriel 2D turbine engine generates greater power, giving the helicopter unmatched maneuverability, performance and payload versatility in comparison with other similar size machines.

Around the world, including Southern Africa, Airbus Helicopters’ products are the top-performing aircraft in their class and a firm favorite with law enforcement agencies. Like Botswana, the police in South Africa, Namibia and Angola have all selected Airbus Helicopters equipment, including numerous AS350 B2, B3 and B3e variants.

Worldwide, to date, Airbus Helicopters has sold more than 5,800 Ecureuil family aircraft (4,900 are in-service), — including more than 1,600 (1,152 B3/476 B3e) B3 series machines — to some 1,800 operators in 120 countries, including numerous law enforcement and civic agencies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996870756149292}",neutral,0.9996870756149292,0
Donaldson receives FAA approval for Airbus Helicopters EC130 T2 inlet barrier filter - Vertical Magazine,"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2RvbmFsZHNvbnJlY2VpdmVzZmFhYXBwcm92YWxmb3JhaXJidXNoZWxpY29wdGVyc2VjMTMwdDJpbmxldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donaldson Aerospace & Defense has received FAA STC approval for its IBF system on the Airbus Helicopters EC130 T2.

Donaldson Aerospace & Defense, a division of Donaldson Company, Inc., has received a supplemental type certificate (STC) from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the only Inlet Barrier Filter (IBF) system available for the Airbus Helicopters EC130 T2 helicopter. This new IBF helps prevent engine damage in all environments and is approved for year-round operations. EC130 T2 operators can now benefit from reduced operating costs via industry leading engine protection, without experiencing performance penalties.

Developed with the assistance of helicopter operators, the EC130 T2 IBF features interchangeable filter elements for mixed fleet operators currently flying EC130 and AS350 B3e aircraft equipped with Donaldson IBF systems.

“We are very appreciative of the support from longtime partner Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters and their fine helicopter tour program,” said Donaldson Aerospace key account director Robert Stenberg. “It is a pleasure working with operators who recognize both the importance of IBF engine protection and our team’s dedication in producing high quality aerospace products.”

The new Donaldson IBF system features a sealed intake plenum that replaces inlet screens or less effective sand filter/particle separators. Design of the EC130 T2 IBF utilizes the existing cowl with minimal modification, including incorporation of an aft-facing bypass system. The filter and bypass system are flush with the upper surface of the cowling, utilizing an internal bypass plenum. An emergency bypass capability is an important Donaldson IBF feature that is lacking in most traditional sand filters and particle separators.

All electrical components are easily accessed from inside the cowling with minimal effort. A simple compact cockpit switch, common with existing Donaldson IBF systems, allows indication and activation of the bypass system. As with all Donaldson certified IBFs, an integral Filter Maintenance Aid allows for on-condition inspections between established service intervals, eliminating unnecessary filter servicing. The flat filter design allows for quick removal and easy service.

Donaldson introduced IBFs to the helicopter market 12 years ago. Since then, Donaldson IBFs have been installed with regulatory approval on AgustaWestland AW109E/S/SPs, AW119 Koalas, AW119Kes and AW139s; Bell 205A1s, 206Bs, 206L-3/4s, 206L-1(C30)s, 230s, 429s and 430s; Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) EC130s, AS350B/BA/B1/B2/B3/B3es, AS350s with Soloy or Heli-Lynx Honeywell engine conversions; and MD Helicopters MD 369Hs, MD 500s and MD 900/902s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8834782242774963}",neutral,0.8834782242774963,0
Airbus confirms long-range A321 – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTUvMDEvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWNvbmZpcm1zLWxvbmctcmFuZ2UtYTMyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has formally given the go-ahead to a long-range version of its narrow-bodied A321, an aircraft more at home on 400-mile flights within Europe.

It is almost 45 years ago to the day since transatlantic passengers thought they had said farewell to narrow-bodied planes like the B707, DC-8 and VC-10.

The future was going to offer wide-bodied comfort. January 1970 saw the first transatlantic flights by the B747 which ushered in a new era of onboard comfort and ride quality.

But it hasn’t turned out that way. Recent times have seen a return of narrow-bodied planes, with their often inferior onboard comfort, on transatlantic routes. (BA’s London City to New York all business class flight being an exception).

The best example would be United, which operates B757s between New York Newark and various European points. But the past year has seen low-cost carriers like Canada’s Westjet and Iceland’s Wow Air instigate tight all-economy flights with smaller B737s.

Why? Well, it’s simply that the smaller planes are cheaper to operate and easier to fill. It therefore means they can serve secondary cities which lack the passenger volume of the big hubs.

Yesterday’s launch in Toulouse of Airbus’ extended range A321 would suggest that, on some routes at least, business travellers are going to trade convenience for inferior onboard standards.

Airbus has revealed that its proposed A321neo will have a range of 4,000 nautical miles, more than enough to reach cities on the US east coast.

The manufacturer originally pitched the A321neo with a 164-seat layout carrying 26 in business, 30 in premium economy and 114 in economy.

But it says that potential customers have indicated they would prefer a higher density layout which would accommodate 206 passengers with business class at 36-inches — far, far tighter than on a wide-body — and economy at 30-inches.

The A321neo won’t enter service before 2019 and already has one customer — Air Lease Corporation has signed a memorandum of understanding for 30 aircraft.

But even before it enters service, airline cost-saving means we can expect to see more narrow-bodied planes appearing on long-distance routes. A good example would be Fly Dubai and Nikki between Bratislava/Vienna and Dubai… but that’s another story.

Chicago-based United also agreed to convert its existing order for 25 A350-900s into the next-generation A350-1000s, giving the airline a total order of 35 aircraft.

The two aircraft, both designed for long-haul routes, are expected to attract many of the same customers as airlines update their dilapidated fleets with more fuel-efficient and modern jumbo jets.

Like the 787-10, United expects deliveries of the Airbus aircraft to begin in 2018.

“This is a modern, fuel-efficient and advanced-technology aircraft,” United CEO Jeff Smisek said in a statement. “It will be a great addition to our fleet, and will allow us to meet demand on larger, long-haul markets in our world-leading network.”

The new A350-1000, a longer version of its predecessor similar to how the 787-10 is a stretched-out version of the Dreamliner, is the largest member of the A350 family and uses composite materials that are expected to save on fuel costs.

Shares of Boeing slumped close to 1% in early trade to $101.50.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9537996649742126}",neutral,0.9537996649742126,0

Flight 94, an Airbus A320, was en route from Orlando, Florida, when air traffic controllers alerted its pilots of an unidentified small aircraft headed directly at them, News12 reported.

According to the regional news channel, the Jetblue flight's pilots were able to change course and narrowly avoid the collision.

According to the AP, passengers on the Airbus claimed the small plane passed close enough for them to hear its engines.

This latest incident comes after another near miss involving a Jetblue Airbus A320.

Earlier this month, a Jetblue flight en route to Austin, Texas, had to abort takeoff and return to the gate at New York's JFK airport after a landing Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 crossed into its path, Reuters reported.

According to the news organization, the two airliners came within 2,800 feet of each other.

In March 2014, a landing United Airlines jet with 155 passengers nearly collided with an ExpressJet plane taking off from Newark Liberty International Airport. According to the LA Times, the two aircraft passed within 200 feet of each other when air traffic control ordered the United Airlines plane to abort landing and climb to a higher altitude.

"Airbus beats Boeing in orders in 2014, but delivers fewer planes - Jordan Times","Tue, 13 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vam9yZGFudGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWJlYXRzLWJvZWluZy1vcmRlcnMtMjAxNC1kZWxpdmVycy1mZXdlci1wbGFuZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE, France — Airbus said Tuesday it beat Boeing with 1,456 net orders last year, but despite handing over a record 629 planes to airlines in 2014 it is still trailing its US rival in deliveries of commercial passenger jets.

The European aerospace company said in a statement that the results ""exceeded its targets for 2014"" and that at the end of last year it ""commanded more than 50 per cent market share for aircraft above 100 seats"".

Airbus said its second-best year ever for new orders propelled it to an industry record backlog of 6,386 aircraft valued at $919.3 billion (777 billion euros) at list prices.

Boeing, which announced its sales and delivery figures last week, had been leading in the orders category throughout the year, but as frequently happens Airbus announced a number of deals in December.

Boeing delivered a record 723 aircraft and took in a record 1,432 orders last year, with its unfilled orders also climbing to a record 5,789 planes.

While the companies focus on the order numbers as they seek to woo even more clients, analysts and investors concentrate on the delivery numbers as the manufacturers get paid when they hand over a plane to airlines.

Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier said in a statement that ""2014 has been an excellent year and the teams in Airbus not only delivered on, but exceeded their targets and commitments"".

At a later press conference, Bregier added: ""We will this year deliver slightly higher numbers of aircrafts.""

Despite trailing Boeing in overall deliveries, Airbus edged out Boeing in the biggest segment of single-aisle medium-haul aircraft. Airbus delivered 490 of its A320 aircraft while Boeing handed over 485 of its 737 planes to airlines.

These aircraft also accounted for most new orders: 1,321 of Airbus' 1,456 orders last year.

Jumbo confidence

But Airbus missed its target of selling 30 of its superjumbo A380 aircraft, which can carry between 525 and 850 passengers in its different seat configurations, with just 14 net orders.

""We believe we will get additional customers this year,"" Bregier told journalists for the A380.

He noted the project would break even this year and had more than two years worth of orders at the current production rate of around 30 aircraft per year.

A milestone for Airbus in 2014 was the certification and first delivery of its long-haul A350, the first of its new generation aircraft whose wings and fuselage are made of carbon fibre and which will save up to 25 per cent in fuel consumption.

Boeing had dominated this segment of midsize long-haul aircraft, with its 787 Dreamliner having won over 1,000 orders.

Airbus expects this segment will see demand over the next two decades of 7,800 planes worth around $1 trillion.

This year is also an important one for Airbus for the development of new aircraft.

Much of the company's increase in orders has been for an upgraded model of its A320 aircraft that features new engines and wing modifications that should provide 20 per cent fuel savings.

Airbus hopes to have A320neo certified in the third quarter and begin delivering the plane to clients before the end of the year.

Cheap oil 'always good'

With fuel one of their largest expenses, airlines have been placing many orders for fuel-efficient aircraft in order to ensure they remain competitive in an industry with tight margins.

But the price of oil has more than halved in the past six months to under $50 a barrel.

Airbus executives said they were not concerned.

A ""lower price of oil is always good for airlines”, said John Leahy, Airbus' chief operating officer for customers. ""Airlines who get more money tend to buy more aircraft"".

The Toulouse-based manufacturer also announced Tuesday a longer-range version of its A320 aircraft that it says will able to make transatlantic flights after having received a preliminary order of 30 of the planes from Air Lease Corporation.

The A321neo that is scheduled to enter service in 2019 will have a maximum range of 6.400 kilometres, slightly more than the single aisle Boeing 757 that is no longer in production.

Several airlines have used the Boeing 757 for transatlantic routes, but in the event of strong headwinds the aircraft would need to put down to refuel.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",positive,0.999993085861206,1
Airbus Staff Scientist Sees Potential of LENRs - New Energy Times,"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5uZXdlbmVyZ3l0aW1lcy5uZXQvMjAxNS8wMS8xNi9haXJidXMtc3RhZmYtc2NpZW50aXN0LXNlZXMtcG90ZW50aWFsLW9mLWxlbnJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jan. 16, 2015 – By Steven B. Krivit –

Jean-François Geneste, a staff member of Airbus Group Innovations, is optimistic about the future of low-energy nuclear reactions (LENRs), he told an audience on Saturday in England.

“If LENRs really work,” Geneste wrote in his slide presentation, “the world will change dramatically. … We want Airbus to be a major actor in tomorrow’s world.”

He spoke at an invitation-only meeting organized by Michel Vandenberghe, president of small Swiss-based company LENR-Cities, founded in August 2014. The meeting was held at Magdalen College, part of Oxford University, although there is no indication that the meeting was an official college or university event. The college advertises that it routinely rents conference facilities for commercial events.

Geneste’s presentation contained nothing scientific about LENRs. It offered his philosophical perspective on physics and science.

Geneste, trained as an aeronautical engineer, has a penchant for new physics, theory and mathematics. He is the author of several books, including Physique: de L’esprit des Lois (Physics: The Spirit of Laws).

On Vandenberghe’s LinkedIn Web page, he describes Geneste as the “Airbus Chief Scientist.” This caused a lot of excitement among LENR enthusiasts because of the endorsement of LENRs from someone with such apparently high stature as the top scientist for the entire Airbus corporation.

A quick search of the Internet turned up no official reference to any Airbus Chief Scientist. According to Marie Caujolle, a media relations manager with whom New Energy Times spoke on Wednesday, Airbus has no such position.

Geneste responded to an e-mail from New Energy Times and wrote that his affiliation is not with Airbus but with Airbus Group Innovations. According to Geneste’s LinkedIn profile, his title is “Vice-President Chief Scientist at Airbus Group.” However, the Airbus Group Web page, which lists many chiefs, does not list anybody with the title of “Chief Scientist.”

New Energy Times spoke with two members of the Airbus Group media relations department, Christine (Eirainer) Manderscheid and Marie-Alix Delestrade. They had never heard of Geneste. After New Energy Times sent Manderscheid a screen image of Mr. Geneste’s LinkedIn profile on Thursday, she sent an e-mail with a title that did not include “Airbus Group.”

“The title of Mr. Geneste is VP Chief Scientist,” Manderscheid wrote.

According to the Web site for Airbus Group Innovations, a network of research facilities, scientists, engineers and partnerships, the person in charge of that department is Jean Botti, the chief technical officer. In response to an e-mail from New Energy Times, Geneste wrote that he “reports effectively to Botti.”

New Energy Times sent an e-mail to Botti and to Manderscheid seeking clarification of Geneste’s role. Botti did not respond. Manderscheid, in an e-mail that she also sent to Martin Agüera, the head of corporate media relations, did not respond to our question about Geneste’s role.

“It would be nice,” Manderscheid wrote today, “if you could give us a bit more explanation on what your article is about.”

Vandenberghe, a newcomer to the field, is a businessman trying to “develop LENRs’ disruptive technologies and speed their industrialization,” according to the company’s press release.

Vandenberghe responded to e-mails from New Energy Times on Wednesday. He said his company employs no scientists and has no issued patents on LENRs. He said, however, that he is seeking investors.

Vandenberghe told New Energy Times that he has “commercial agreements” with two scientists. The first is Yogendra Srivastava, a professor of nuclear physics at Perugia University in Italy and a former collaborator on the Widom-Larsen theory of LENRs, with Allan Widom and Lewis Larsen. New Energy Times sent an e-mail to Srivastava to confirm the existence of an agreement. Srivastava did not respond.

The second is Luca Gamberale, a physicist who worked for Pirelli Labs for a decade, occasionally on LENRs. Two and a half years after Gamberale left Pirelli, he went to work for Defkalion Europe, a company purporting to have a working commercial LENR device similar to that of convicted fraudster Andrea Rossi.

Gamberale left Defkalion after nine months and has started his own company to conduct research and development in LENRs, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Vandenberghe wrote to New Energy Times that “Airbus Group has signed a letter of intent” to work with his company. New Energy Times sent an e-mail to Botti and to Manderscheid and asked whether Airbus Group Corporation had signed any kind of agreement or letter with LENR-Cities. Neither responded.

A rash of new promoters has invaded the LENR field in the last few years, creating hype and false hope. Nevertheless, some funding has supported a few good scientists who are eager to work on their passion, LENRs.

Although businesspeople have been promoting LENR startup companies for two decades, low-energy nuclear reactions have a ways to go before they are successfully commercialized.

In parallel with this, serious work is taking place in Japan at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, and these researchers are publishing results in peer-reviewed journals and filing patent applications.

An Airbus A321 with a 97-ton Maximum Weight — Where Can I Get One!? - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS9haXJidXMtYTMyMS05Ny10b24tcGF5bG9hZC1jYW4tZ2V0LW9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has done what analysts have been expecting for the past few months; announce a version of the A321 with the ability to fly a greatly extended range and finally match (and exceed) the capabilities of a Boeing 757-200 with winglets.

The 97-ton maximum weight will be achieved by the addition of a fuel tank in the forward baggage compartment and some fairly low-cost reengineering of the wing. Air Lease Corporation is the launch customer, with a memorandum of understanding for thirty frames. They have not, yet, stated where these aircraft will be placed.

To achieve a 4000-nm range, Airbus has envisioned a configuration carrying 206 passengers (16J and 190Y). They have also stated that, due to the extra fuel tank and limitations of the design, it is unlikely for this aircraft to be able to carry much cargo. This may, immediately, appear as a source of consternation if your airline relies on flying long sorties on narrow-bodies full of fresh fish. Otherwise, is it really a big deal? I would say no.

There is a lot of surplus belly freight capacity in the world right now. Some say that there is such a surplus that the global belly-freight load factor is around 40%. Freight is also connection-agnostic. Will a lack of belly freight on routes served at the edge of the capability of the A321LR break routes currently served by a 757 with winglets? Not likely.

The simple difference in structural rates and heretofore unknown improvements in the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan will reduce the trip costs significantly – removing the need for revenue from cargo, which can connect onto one of the many wide-bodies out of larger airports served by the same airlines.

There is one more quibble with the marketing. I highly doubt that we will see 206-passenger configured A321LRs. That foresees a business class with a pitch of 36″. Given that airlines need to remain competitive, we can assume that there will be lie-flat seats in the premium cabin. With the space those take up, I would imagine a seat count of 160-180 would be more realistic.

Regardless of seating capacity, Airbus sees a market for at least 400 97-ton payload A321s.

Any airline that currently operates 757s on long stage lengths could easily purchase these upgraded Airbuses.

So for fun, I’ve used Great Circle Mapper to make some fantasy maps. If you were Delta, American, or United (yes, I know their New York-area hub is EWR) this is what kind of operation the A321LR would allow you to operate. This aircraft may also finally push certain lower-cost airlines to diversify their market and thrust across the seas.

Note: all maps are still-air range. Realistically speaking, there are headwinds to fight and airspace considerations to route around. Real-world operational range will probably be closer to 3,600-nm.

The good thing about maps is that the reciprocal also holds true. Notice how all of Scandinavia is within the highlighted area of the mercator projection. Airlines like SAS could utilize the A321LR on more point-to-point flying into North America.

The North and South American carriers also have the luxury of using this aircraft to expand deeper into South America with an even smaller aircraft. From Miami, all the South American capitals are in reach.

Another use-case being thrown about on the aviation internet is that of it being useful for point-to-point flying into Africa and the Middle East from the major European hubs. This right-sized aircraft would allow the European legacy carriers a new way to compete with their Gulf Coast arch-rivals.

Hawaiian Airlines has sixteen A321NEOs on order, with nine options — what could 4,000 nm of range offer them?

While most of the 4,000 nm manifest is open sea, an aircraft with such range would allow Hawaiian to connect to more Southern Pacific island nations. It would also allow them to open up more cities within North America that do not have the traffic to sustain a larger aircraft.

To finish my little presentation of maps. Let’s take a look at what a 97-ton A321 could offer our friends in the Gulf. I chose AUH because Etihad already has a small fleet of A321s. For them, 4,000 nm, in any direction, puts them within reach of the majority of the world’s population. For an airline with connections in mind, the possibilities are endless.

The A321LR will make its debut in 2019, so I am afraid we have four years to wait to see what it can really do. In the interim, however we will see which customers actually purchase it.

Regardless of who orders it, if you lived in a secondary European city that sustained trans-Atlantic service using 757s, you no longer have to worry about your service disappearing as 757s slowly age out.

Boeing — your move.

Airbus CEO promises shake-up after new A400M delays - Yahoo Canada Shine On,"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtY2VvLXByb21pc2VzLXNoYWtlLWE0MDBtLWRlbGF5cy0xNDE5MjkwNDItLWZpbmFuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Airbus Group has promised management and organizational changes at the European aerospace firm after new delays and quality problems with its A400M military transport plane. Apologizing during a speech in London for the latest problems with Europe's largest defense project, Chief Executive Tom Enders said: ""We have not performed as we would have wished on the A400M, and I must apologize."" ""...There will be management and organizational consequences to the program, and we will learn our lessons from this,"" he told UK politicians and military leaders. A copy of Tuesday evening's remarks was provided by Airbus, which declined further comment. Airbus said in November there had been delays in adding advanced tactical features and refueling on certain aircraft, some of which would have to be retrofitted. It did not rule out taking further charges on top of 4.2 billion euros of provisions over the life of the project, which received a 3.5-billion-euro, seven-nation bailout in 2010. Enders said Airbus was working hard to deliver the A400M as rapidly as possible and would ensure Britain's air force had seven aircraft in service by the end of 2015. The largest customer, Germany - which took delivery in December of the first of 53 of the airlifters it has ordered - criticized Airbus last week over delays and quality problems on the A400M. The project has undergone several transformations, switching from a separate Spanish-based military transport unit to come under the wing of first the France-based Airbus civil planemaking unit and now an enlarged defense division based in Germany. In 2010, Enders sacked military transport head Carlos Suarez after a disagreement over how the project was being run. Airbus last year brought back Rafael Tentor for a second stint in running the program. He reports to Domingo Urena-Raso, the head of Airbus's recently reorganized military aircraft activities, part of the Airbus Defence & Space division which is also in the midst of restructuring. The latest delays come against the backdrop of tensions between Airbus and Germany over sweeping defense cuts. A total of 170 A400Ms have been ordered by seven partner nations, which also include Belgium, Britain, France, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey.

Airbus A350 XWB - Global Security,"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvYTM1MC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350 XWB

The newest Airbus A350 operated by Qatar Airways has made its debut flight on 15 January 2015, taking its passengers from the Qatari capital of Doha to Frankfurt, Germany. The Airbus 350 can carry 276 to 369 passengers, depending on the airliner's configuration. Positioned as a successor to the A330 and A340, the A350 boasts a lightweight design that reduces fuel consumption substantially. The jetliner's airframe is made of composite structures with titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, together with a Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) fuselage.

Airbus already had got ""778 orders for the A350 from 41 different airlines and jet leasing companies including, British Airways, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines."" However, Boeing, Airbus's major rival, was still outstripping its competitor with 1,071 orders to its 787.

The A350 XWB is the all-new mid-size long range product line comprising three versions and seating between 270 and 350 passengers in spacious three-class layouts. The new family brought a step change in efficiency compared with existing aircraft in this size category, using 25 per cent less fuel and providing an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions. By mid-2013 the A350 XWB had already won 613 firm orders from 33 customers worldwide.

The A350 Family provides long-range capability with seating capacities from 250 to 400-plus passengers. This enables airlines to match their A350 XWB fleets to route capacity demands, guaranteeing optimum revenue potential and excellent operating efficiency. The aircraft family concept, proven by Airbus with its other jetliners, also ensures optimal efficiency through the A350 XWBs commonality in engines, systems and spare parts, while also enabling pilots to fly all three versions with a single type rating.

Airbus A350 XWB family consists of three versions (the A350-800, -900 and -1000)  each with flight ranges that give them a global reach. In a typical three-class configuration, the A350-800 accommodates 270 passengers, while the A350-900 and the A350-1000 seat 314 and 350 passengers, respectively. All A350 XWB Family members can be configured for higher density layouts of up to 440 seats.

Responding to the markets call for additional payload and range, the A350-1000 is equipped with more powerful Trent XWB engines  which are fully optimised for this largest member of the A350 XWB Family. The enhanced Trent XWB delivers up to 97,000 lb. of thrust on takeoff, making it the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft. This extra thrust  together with an increased aircraft takeoff weight capability of 308 tonnes  enables operators to fly the A350-1000 some 400 nm. further with a full load of 350 passengers, or to carry approximately 4.5 extra tonnes of payload at a given range.

The A350 XWBs wide fuselage cross-section was designed for an optimum travel experience in all classes of service. Passengers enjoy more headroom, wider panoramic windows and larger overhead storage space. With a cross-section of 220 inches from armrest to armrest, the jetliners cabin provides the widest seats in its category, being five inches larger than its nearest competitor. In addition to providing the space for unmatched premium first class and business solutions, the A350 XWB allows for high-comfort economy seating in a nine-abreast arrangement, with a generous 18-inch seat width.

Rest areas for the flight crew  which are used in long-range operations  are located in the fuselages crown area, offering unequalled comfort for without reducing overall revenue passenger seating capacity. Cabin crewmembers will utilise a rest facility in the A350 XWBs rear fuselage that accommodates six to eight bunks. It has a full-height standing area, providing a comfortable zone that allows crews to prepare and dress more easily.

Initially [as of early 2006] the A350 design was based on the A330 jet but used new engines and a lighter airframe, thanks to a composite-plastic wing and a fuselage made from aluminum/lithium alloy. However, it had the same fuselage cross-section Airbus had 30 years earlier, and the wing shape was unchanged. This approach had the lowest investment and lowest risk.

By June 2006 Airbus officials was informally giving airline executives details of a redesigned long-range, two-aisle jet, which would seat nine passengers in each economy-class row, instead of eight in the original A350 version. Initial customer reaction was positive. As a result of the redesign, as of 2006 it appeared that Airbus might not be able to deliver the first of the new planes until at least 2012, two years later than originally planned and four years after Boeing's competing 787 model was scheduled for delivery.

On 14 June 2013 the first A350 XWB to fly landed back at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport France at 14.05 hours local time after successfully completing its first flight that lasted four hours and five minutes (245 minutes). The aircraft was flown by Peter Chandler, Airbus Chief Test Pilot, and Guy Magrin, Project Pilot for the A350 XWB. Accompanying them in the cockpit was Pascal Verneau, the A350 XWB Project Test Flight Engineer. Monitoring the progress of the flight profile were the three flight test engineers: Fernando Alonso, Head of Airbus Flight & Integration Test Centre; Patrick du Ché, Head of Development Flight Tests; and Emanuele Costanzo, lead Flight Test Engineer for the Trent XWB engine.

For its first flight, the A350 XWB  carrying the registration F-WXWB  took off at around 221 tonnes. During the flight, which took the aircraft around south western France, the crew explored the aircrafts flight envelope. The aircraft was accompanied by a chase plane to observe and film the various manoeuvres. Its progress was monitored by experts on the ground in real-time via a direct telemetry link. This maiden flight marks the beginning of a rigorous test flight campaign involving five A350s, and around 2,500 flight hours. It would culminate in the aircrafts certification followed by its entry into airline service scheduled for the second half of 2014 with first operator Qatar Airways.

Has Boeing Been Too Late in Reengineering The 737? - Fox Business,"Wed, 07 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2hhcy1ib2VpbmctYmVlbi10b28tbGF0ZS1pbi1yZWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLXRoZS03MzfSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9oYXMtYm9laW5nLWJlZW4tdG9vLWxhdGUtaW4tcmVlbmdpbmVlcmluZy10aGUtNzM3LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With demand for narrow-body commercial airplanes going through the roof, planemakers Boeing and Airbus have come under pressure in the last few years to build new-age single-aisle planes. The twist in the tale came when in December 2010 Airbus announced that instead of a clean slate design it will fit new engines in its current generation A320 narrow-body aircraft family. The brilliance of this move did not go un-noticed and Boeing made a similar announcement for its own best-selling 737 series, eight months later.

But by then Airbus had already secured a lead in terms of new orders over Boeing. How costly will this lead prove for Boeing? Is reengineering actually the best solution? What are the dynamics between the next generation A320s and 737s? Let's find out.

A crucial leadIn its latest market outlook, Boeing predicts that airlines will take deliveries of more than 25,000 single-aisle planes valued at $2.5 trillion. A look at the current backlogs of Boeing and Airbus indicates that already 9,050 or 36% of the future narrow-body planes have been ordered. As investors can see from the chart below, Airbus has secured a small lead over Boeing in the future market.

Source: Boeing and Airbus, chart by author.

At this point, it will be interesting to see how much of Airbus' success is owing to its next generation narrow-body dubbed as A320 neo and how it compares with Boeing. Neo stands for 'New Engine Option' and Airbus has decided to fit its A320 family of airplanes with CFM International's LEAP-1A andPratt & Whitney's PurePower PW1100G-JM engines. The A320 neo is 95% the same plane but with 20% better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions than the older version. In turn, Boeing has opted for CFM International's LEAP-1B engines to reengineer its 737 series planes.The new range is known as 737 Max and Boeing claims that it's 4% more fuel efficient than the A320 neo.

Source: Boeing and Airbus, chart by author.

The charts show that for both the plane makers, the majority of pending orders are for next generation planes. But, the A320 neo forms a bigger portion of Airbus' narrow-body backlog than 737 Max's share in Boeing's backlog. So, the A320 neo has played a big role in Airbus' current success and has turned out to be the world's fastest-selling aircraft. Airbus' current lead in narrow-body orders can worry Boeing and its investors if the French company continues to maintain or widen it.

Was reengineering the right move?Airbus originally wanted to make a clean slate design, but shelved the plan in 2010. With huge expenditures on built-from-scratch planes like A380, which is yet to break even, or the brand new A350, it needed a more cost-effective solution. A built-from-scratch plane would have cost Airbus $10 billion and above, while the reengineered program cost has been $1.3 billion.

Similarly, Boeing is having a tough time with cost overruns on its Dreamliner 787 program. Even after 210 deliveries, the all-new design plane is yet to book profit. Deferred costs on the program have exceeded $25 billion and left Boeing hard pressed for cash.

Both the companies wanted to maintain the demand momentum without having to invest heavily on a cleanslate design. The reengineering option fit the bill perfectly. But, eventually, Boeing and Airbus would need new planes as the life of the current aircraft cannot be extended beyond a point.

Boeing has already announced an all-new model to replace the 737 Max by 2030. So for Airbus, the question is ""when?"" rather than ""will it?"" Airbus chief commercial officer John Leahy has said that new technologies that the company is developing are expected to be ready by the middle of the next decade, and then it would decide about a completely new design.

Current dynamicsThe aero majors are benefiting from reengineering as evidenced from their fat order books, and both have decided to augment production Airbus will increase monthly production of A320 to 46 from the current rate of 42, while Boeing will augment 737 output to 52 from 42 today.

But, Airbus' decision to reengineer the A320 family has got the better of Boeing.The A320 neo will take to the skies in late 2015 with Qatar Airways as its launch customer, while Boeing customers will have to wait for a couple of more years before the 737 enters service in 2017. Airbus has got an early mover advantage over the 737 Max as reflected in the total orders tally (see chart 2).

In order to catch up with the A320neo, Boeing's offering more than an engine upgrade and better fuel efficiency. According toAirline Consultants.Com, the 737 Max will weigh less on a per seat basis and offer several airframe improvements. But airlines are still going for more A320neos. In 2014, airline operators placed firm orders for 752 A320 neo and 424 737 Max.

Boeing needs to gather greater number of 737 Max orders for it to maintain its competitive position in the future narrow-body market. If that doesn't happen, it could create pressure on the stock.

U.S. court issues injunction against Bell in landing gear fight - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdXNjb3VydGlzc3Vlc2luanVuY3Rpb25hZ2FpbnN0YmVsbGlubGFuZGluZ2dlYXJmaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During its development, the Bell 429 was initially equipped with this “sleigh-type” landing gear, which infringed an Airbus Helicopters patent, a U.S. court has found. Mike Reyno Photo

A United States District Court has ruled that Bell Helicopter infringed an Airbus Helicopters patent in the design of the original landing gear for the Bell 429 — and has issued a permanent injunction barring Bell from using that landing gear for the life of the patent.

In a ruling released on Jan. 27 — the latest development in a legal battle that stretches back to 2008 — U.S. Circuit Judge Robert L. Wilkins found that Bell copied Airbus Helicopters’ patented “sleigh-type” landing gear design in the initial development of the 429. That’s consistent with a 2012 ruling by the Federal Court of Canada, which found that Bell exhibited “deliberate and outrageous conduct” in copying the landing gear design.

Although Canadian Justice Luc Martineau took a dim view of Bell’s conduct in that 2012 ruling, he also found that the modified landing gear on production Bell 429s does not violate Airbus Helicopters’ patent. Later in 2012, a French court also ruled that the production 429 landing gear does not infringe the patent.

In the latest ruling, Wilkins agreed that the production landing gear is not a patent violation. However, he found that Bell has an incentive to resume use of the sleigh-type landing gear because of its lighter weight, thereby justifying issuance of the permanent injunction.

“Although Bell’s representative testified that Bell does not intend to use the original gear in the future . . . the Court is not convinced that it can rely on this representation,” Wilkins wrote. “Moreover, even if Bell voluntarily adopts a policy of using a different gear, Bell has in the past ignored its own policies with respect to intellectual property rights.”

The patent in question concerns the sleigh-type or “moustache” landing gear used on Airbus Helicopters’ EC120 and EC130 models. Sleek, lightweight, and particularly resistant to ground resonance, the landing gear was developed in the mid-1990s and subsequently patented in France, Canada, and the U.S., although Airbus (then Eurocopter) did not immediately mark the landing gear as patented.

In 2003, while developing the light twin-engine 429, Bell allegedly leased an EC120 for several months in order to study that helicopter’s landing gear. Bell then adopted a similar sleigh-type design as the baseline landing gear for its 429, using the gear during certification testing and displaying it at Helicopter Association International’s 2008 Heli-Expo in Houston, Texas. Moreover, also in 2008, Bell presented a technical paper on the landing gear design at American Helicopter Society International’s 64th Annual Forum, misrepresenting the gear as its own invention, according to Wilkins’ ruling.

While Wilkins granted that “customers generally do not make their purchasing decisions based on the landing gear of an aircraft,” he found that Bell’s use of the sleigh-type landing gear allowed the company to accelerate the 429’s development program. That early entry into the marketplace likely harmed sales of Airbus’ light twin-engine EC135 and EC145 models, which have seen their market shares decline since the 429’s certification.

In requesting the permanent injunction, Airbus noted that sales of the 429 in the U.S. are currently being constrained by the aircraft’s weight (as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has denied Bell’s request to increase the maximum gross weight of the aircraft from 7,000 to 7,500 pounds). Airbus argued — and Wilkins agreed — that Bell therefore has an incentive to resume use of the sleigh-type gear, which would achieve a weight savings of approximately 10 to 20 pounds. In his ruling, Wilkins cites testimony that “'[e]ven half a pound matters when trying to minimize helicopter weight.”

In an email to Vertical, however, Bell dismissed this argument, describing the prototype landing gear as “only marginally lighter than the production gear.”

“Bell Helicopter takes great pride in its business integrity,” the company stated. “We have and will continue to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties. We are pleased that the U.S. Court joined the courts in France and Canada in rejecting [Airbus Helicopters’] claim that the 429 production gear infringed [Airbus Helicopters’] patent. All Bell 429s have been and will continue to be delivered with the current production gear. The subject of this injunction is a prototype skid gear that was never certified and was never delivered on any Bell 429.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9935843348503113}",neutral,0.9935843348503113,0
Australian military EC135 T2+ trainer takes to air - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2F1c3RyYWxpYW5taWxpdGFyeWVjMTM1dDJ0cmFpbmVydGFrZXN0b2Fpci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First flight of the EC135 T2+ (Australian Defence Force variant) at the Donauwörth plant in Germany. Charles Abarr Photos/Airbus Helicopters

The first EC135 T2+ in a planned fleet of modern, twin-engine rotary wing aircraft being acquired by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for its new Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS) has completed its first flight in Europe.

Under the HATS project, a joint training scheme for both Army and Navy aircraft will utilize some 15 Airbus Helicopters EC135 T2+ trainers, along with EC135 flight simulators and a new flight deck-equipped, sea-going vessel.

Boeing Defence Australia (BDA) is the prime contractor for the new training system, partnered by Thales Australia, which will provide the flight simulators.

The first EC135 T2+ (serial number 1179) took off from the Airbus Helicopters production site in Donauwörth, Germany, where the helicopter is assembled, at 2:47 p.m. local time on Jan. 16, and landed back onsite 57 minutes later.

The Airbus Helicopters Flight Test Department reported the successful first flight had validated the full performance of the aircraft’s systems and engines, and that future flights would test specific customer equipment.



Boeing Defence Australia is prime contractor and Thales Australia supplies flight simulators for the EC135 T2+.

Said Peter Harris, Airbus Helicopters head of sales for Australia Pacific: “At Airbus Helicopters we are thrilled to have reached such a fantastic milestone in only two months from contract signing last November. This clearly demonstrates the commitment that we have to supporting Boeing Defence Australia in meeting the ADF’s needs for training all future combat helicopter aircrew for the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army. We will take all of our milestones just as seriously.”

While the EC135 T2+ is a civil design helicopter, it has also proven to be a consummate military trainer. With a high-visibility glass cockpit, multi-axis autopilot and the performance and safety of a twin-engine helicopter replacing current single-engine types, it is similar to the multi-role and combat helicopters now in service with the ADF — including new-generation Tiger ARH and MRH90 helicopters — and meets all training, technical and safety requirement for future Army and Navy aircrews.

Initial operating capability (IOC) is scheduled for late 2018, although students will begin arriving earlier. When fully IOC the HATS system will accommodate up to 130 students a year, covering pilots, aviation warfare officers, crewmembers, sensor operators and qualified aircrew returning for instructor training.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999761581420898}",neutral,0.9999761581420898,0
EDRS Exemplifies Uneasy Relationship Between EC and ESA - SpaceNews,"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kYXRhLXJlbGF5LXByb2plY3QtZXhlbXBsaWZpZXMtdW5lYXN5LXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC1iZXR3ZWVuLWV1cm9wZWFuLWNvbW1pc3Npb24tYW5kLWVzYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BRUSSELS — The level of mistrust and disdain between the European Space Agency and the European Commission shows no sign of subsiding despite European governments’ reaffirmation that ESA would remain an independent body, European government and industry officials said.

What both sides once viewed hopefully as a problem of personalities that could be solved with a changing of the guard is now seen as a deeper institutional issue.

The most recent manifestation is the European Data Relay System, EDRS, an ambitious effort to create, with Airbus Defence and Space, a global optical satellite data-relay service for civil and military users, said these officials.

“ESA views the commission as ESA’s in-house banker, there only to provide the money and to keep away from program details,” one government official said. “And the commission views ESA as a technician, competent in its limited areas of expertise but incapable of setting strategy.”

That ESA and the commission — which is the executive arm of the 28-nation European Union — are condemned to work together is beyond dispute. The commission has become a major ESA financier, mainly through the Galileo satellite navigation network and the Copernicus satellite environment-monitoring program.

After openly insulting ESA in Galileo’s early days by saying the agency was incapable of correctly auditing its industrial contractors, the commission has come to realize that it will not have ESA space-program management skills anytime soon. A commission investigation of ESA’s Galileo contracts — a review designed to prove ESA’s lax program management — found nothing to suggest ESA was letting Galileo contractors line their pockets.

Talk of the commission’s eventual ownership of ESA has ended for now with European governments’ 2014 decision to retain the agency as a separate entity that would be, in effect, the commission’s prime contractor for space programs.

But despite these developments, the two sides often appear to be at sixes and sevens with each other — when they are not openly questioning each other’s competence. This has been repeatedly in evidence in both Galileo and Copernicus.

One Incident, Two Perspectives

From ESA’s point of view, the August failure of a Europeanized Soyuz rocket that placed two Galileo satellites into a useless orbit was, as space failures go, remarkably minor.

The design error in the rocket’s Fregat upper stage was discovered and corrected. The two satellites were fully tested in orbit despite their bad location and found to be functioning as expected, and 20 more identical spacecraft were already under contract with industry. This was not a billion-dollar satellite with no backup available. The Galileo radio frequencies had already been secured, and even a worst-case scenario the overall effects on the program were viewed as minimal.

But here in Brussels, the failure was viewed as a serious blow to Galileo, to which the commission has committed 6.4 billion euros ($8 billion) in its seven-year financial package for 2014-2020, including the Egnos GPS/Galileo overlay system.

At times, the commission, whose leadership changed in November, appeared shell-shocked by the Galileo launch anomaly and until Jan. 28 was uncertain whether to proceed with additional Soyuz launches. It took a meeting of the entire College of Commissioners and the commission president to approve a Soyuz launch.

“We had a setback, but we’ll go forward,” said Elzbieta Bienkowska, the commission’s new de facto space commissioner, in announcing the Soyuz decision at a space conference here. “I am determined to put the Galileo program back on track.”

One European space industry official said that if the commission had been in charge of space policy in 1996, when the Ariane 5 heavy-lift rocket exploded shortly after liftoff on its inaugural flight, “there would not have been a second Ariane 5 mission. They would have abandoned it.”

The Copernicus Earth observation program, budgeted at 3.8 billion euros for 2014-2020, was the subject of early miscues between ESA and the commission, with ESA going to far as to threaten to stop launching satellites until the commission formally committed to pursuing the program.

EDRS, intended as a global network of optical laser nodes speeding delivery of data from low-orbiting Earth observation satellites — including Copernicus craft — to identical nodes in geostationary orbit and then to ground users, is illustrative.

Budgeted at around 500 million euros, EDRS was conceived as a public-private partnership between ESA and Airbus Defence and Space.

Airbus agreed to invest some 130 million euros of its own money into the system, on the condition that ESA validate the technology and provide minimum guarantees that European governments would use EDRS services as anchor customers. With much of its nonrecurring costs covered, Airbus then would commercialize the service worldwide, with the U.S. Defense Department viewed as a prospective customer.

To reduce costs all around, one of the two EDRS laser nodes intended for geostationary orbit was scheduled for placement on a satellite that would carry a hosted telecommunications payload owned by Avanti Communications of London, a publicly traded company that raised 75 million British pounds ($128 million) in public bonds to finance its payload. Airbus contracted with OHB AG of Bremen, Germany, to build the satellite, which Airbus and ESA call EDRS-C and Avanti calls Hylas-3.

The Airbus-ESA goal to have all system commitments wrapped up by February 2014. That deadline came and went as ESA took longer than expected to sign a broad Copernicus agreement with the commission and to validate the EDRS technology. Both these objectives were met in November.

But the commission did not sign an EDRS Service Level Agreement within the Copernicus arrangement with ESA.

“ESA has asked us to commit to using a service we don’t need, and used assumptions about our contribution in negotiating with Airbus,” one commission official said. “They did not ask us beforehand, they just assumed we’d go along. This is not how we do things.”

Another commission official said ESA had integrated into its Airbus contract 20 million euros per year of commission funding for five years. “This wasn’t based on any assessment of our use of EDRS, and it was more than the whole system costs to operate. It’s as if they wanted to hide this aspect until the last minute. Then they come to us in late 2014 and say there is a contract deadline of Dec. 22.”

From Impasse to Uncertainty

The Dec. 22 deadline was passed with no agreement on financing.

On Jan. 16, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain said the financing issue might force a cancellation of the EDRS-C satellite.

On Jan. 22, in response to SpaceNews inquiries, ESA said it was having discussions with “a few” ESA nations involved in EDRS with a view to resolving a 10 million-euro gap in ESA’s own EDRS funding plan.

On Jan. 26, in what appeared to be an attempt to calm Avanti investors, ESA said it would meet with Airbus on Jan. 28 and that all outstanding issues would be resolved, and that EDRS-C/Hylas 3 would be built.

On Jan. 27, Philippe Brunet, director-general at the commission’s directorate responsible for space — formally titled internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and SMEs— said the EDRS issues “are on the verge of being discussed.”

On Jan. 28, Evert Dudok, head of Airbus’ Communication, Intelligence and Security division, which includes the EDRS program, told the Brussels conference Airbus remains a believer in the EDRS potential but that “innovations like this will need some time for market pickup, and it is fundamental that we have anchor customers like the commission.”

A series of meetings the evening of Jan. 28 apparently made some progress, with one official saying the commission would be willing to pay 12 million euros per year for EDRS for five years.

It was unclear whether ESA and Airbus had found additional monies on their part to fill the funding gap. One official said Airbus raised anew the possibility of launching EDRS-C with SpaceX of the United States, rather than aboard an Ariane 5 — a threat that caused negative French government reaction in December.

On Jan. 30, ESA issued a statement saying “ESA and Airbus confirm partnership to complete the full [EDRS] system.” There was no mention of the commission’s role or of financing.

Dordain’s office referred inquiries to Magali Vaissiere, ESA’s director of telecommunications, whose division includes EDRS. Vaissiere declined an interview request, saying: “We will continue to communicate, as we have done in recent weeks and months, at each important program development milestone.”

The departure of Domingo Ureña Raso – who had headed the programme for almost five years – was announced two days after Airbus chief executive Tom Enders promised that production and delivery delays on the A400M would have “managerial and organisational consequences”.

Airbus head of flight test operations Fernando Alonso will replace Ureña Raso from 1 March, with Airbus Defence & Space chief executive Bernhard Gerwert to oversee Military Aircraft activities in the interim period.

Under a wider restructuring also announced on 29 January, responsibility for the A400M programme’s industrial activities will be transferred to Pilar Albiac-Murillo at Airbus’s Operations unit. Existing programme head Rafael Tentor will continue to be responsible for development activities and customer deliveries, Airbus says.

Gerwert says he expects the action to “rapidly address existing shortfalls” in the company’s delivery of the tactical transport to eight nations.

French air force

While he notes that delivered examples are exceeding specifications in the basic logistical transport role, Gerwert says: “For the integration of military capabilities and the industrial ramp-up in particular, we have not been performing at the level which had been expected of us.” The company will do its “utmost” to address concerns “so the customers receive the aircraft they need in the shortest time possible”, he adds.

Full details of the restructuring plan will be presented as Airbus delivers its financial results for 2014 in Munich on 27 February. However, its Defence & Space unit confirms that several scheduled new capabilities will be integrated with the “Atlas” in the second half of this year. These will include aerial delivery, a cargo handling system, defensive aids system equipment and hose and drogue refuelling pods.

“Additional military capabilities will be integrated up until 2018, as contractually agreed,” Airbus says, while describing discussions with its customer nations via Europe’s OCCAR procurement agency as “intense and constructive”.

What next for Korean Air’s inflight sales and service after Nutgate? - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDEvbmV4dC1rb3JlYW4tYWlycy1pbmZsaWdodC1zYWxlcy1zZXJ2aWNlLW51dGdhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With Korean Air’s former senior VP of inflight service Heather Cho Hyun-ah facing trial on numerous charges related to last month’s “nut rage” incident, an airline that is a bastion of inflight duty free and cabin services appears to find itself rudderless in a key moneymaking area for the carrier.

The whole affair, akin to a kind of Korean Kennedy scandal, continues to raise questions about the management of the chaebol conglomerates that run Korea’s two largest airlines, Hanjin’s Korean Air and Kumho Asiana’s carrier Asiana Airlines.

Cho Hyun-ah is a member of the third chaebol generation, the daughter of Korean Air chairman & CEO Cho Yang-ho and granddaughter of Hanjin founder Cho Joong-hoon. As SVP inflight service, she had been deeply involved in the airline’s expansive inflight sales offering, as well as Korean Air’s often exemplary passenger experience.

RGN asked Korean Air’s US representative for information on the status quo of the airline’s inflight sales and service, including who is now in charge, and whether the airline’s strategy for sales, service and #PaxEx would change. Weeks later, and despite pressing the airline for details, Korean Air has yet to respond to our queries.

$200 million at stake in inflight sales alone

In the context of Delta dropping inflight duty free in August 2014, the scale of the east Asian inflight sales business and its importance to Korean Air’s bottom line is remarkable.

On Korean Air flights late last year (author note: redeeming Chase points for international first class Paris-Seoul-Shanghai) it was striking that the airline offers “please wake me for the duty free” stickers for the headrest, in addition to the more usual “do not disturb” and “please wake me for the meal service” options.

Yet the limited sales data available suggest the numbers over the last few years have not been entirely rosy. Korean Air’s 2013 inflight sales targets quoted by industry publication TRBusiness were “approximately US$200 million”, roughly flat with 2012’s $199 million, which was itself down 3% on 2011’s figures.

Korean paper Chosun Ilbo reports that Korean Air’s year-on-year domestic passengers for the month of December were 6% down on 2014, which the paper lays squarely at the door of the “nut rage” incident.

Will Korean Air’s strategy of making space for inflight sales continue?

As far back as 2006, Cho Hyun-ah was instrumental in removing two seats from Korean Air’s Airbus A330-300 aircraft in order to create additional storage and provisioning space for inflight sales, according to a contemporary interview with Cho in The Moodie Report.

Five years later, Korean Air gave over a section of the rear service area on its Airbus A380s to an inflight duty-free boutique. The airline has eight rows in the centre section between doors 4 and 5, where Singapore Airlines has 10 — a significant difference even when taking into account the 18” taken up by the 2” of pitch differential between two airlines.

Upstairs, to the rear of the all-business upper deck, Korean Air offers one of the largest inflight bar areas, behind door 3 — a fusion of Cho’s inflight sales and inflight service responsibilities, thanks to a partnership with forward-thinking beverage conglomerate Pernod Ricard’s Absolut vodka brand. Korean Air flight attendants are specially trained to mix Absolut-based cocktails for first and business class passengers.

Will Korean Air adjust inflight sales space and refit the A380?

Cho Hyun-ah’s inflight sales division was clearly given a wide remit on the A380’s internal layout, and her fall from grace must spur questions about the future of the non-seating areas on the A380.

Korean Air recently revealed its new Prestige Suite business class, based on the B/E Aerospace “high-density first class” Apex product also seen on Japan Airlines’ Boeing 777-300ER fleet. The product is a staggered fully flat bed with direct aisle access, a significant improvement over the 2-2-2 seating on Korean Air’s Airbus A330-300 aircraft, which will be the first to see the new seats.

Of course, the airline must be considering installing the Apex product on the A380, the upper deck of which is very similar in cross-section and seat layout options to the A330. The “record backlog” in business class seating may have led Korean Air to replace the 18 older business seats on an A330-300 before the 94 seats on an A380.

The burning question is: will Korean Air remove the A380’s Celestial Bar in favour of giving over the space to an eight-seat possible boost in business class revenue?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988987445831299}",neutral,0.9988987445831299,0

A Jetblue airliner was nearly involved in a midair collision with another aircraft near Westchester County Airport in New York last Sunday.

Flight 94, an Airbus A320, was en route from Orlando, Florida, when air traffic controllers alerted its pilots of an unidentified small aircraft headed directly at them, News12 reported.

According to the regional news channel, the Jetblue flight's pilots were able to change course and narrowly avoid the collision.

According to the AP, passengers on the Airbus claimed the small plane passed close enough for them to hear its engines.

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating.

This latest incident comes after another near miss involving a Jetblue Airbus A320.

Earlier this month, a Jetblue flight en route to Austin, Texas, had to abort takeoff and return to the gate at New York's JFK airport after a landing Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 crossed into its path, Reuters reported.

According to the news organization, the two airliners came within 2,800 feet of each other.

In March 2014, a landing United Airlines jet with 155 passengers nearly collided with an ExpressJet plane taking off from Newark Liberty International Airport. According to the LA Times, the two aircraft passed within 200 feet of each other when air traffic control ordered the United Airlines plane to abort landing and climb to a higher altitude.

ANA Holdings has ordered seven more A321 aircraft (four A321ceo with Sharklets and three A321neo), in addition to the firm order for 30 A320neo Family (seven A320neo and 23 A321neo) placed in July 2014.

The latest agreement brings ANA’s total order for the A320 Family to 37 aircraft which will gradually replace its existing single aisle fleet. ANA will be the first Japanese operator of both Sharklet-equipped A321ceo and A321neo.

“We are extremely pleased that such a prestigious airline as Japan’s ANA, has placed repeat orders for our A320 Family aircraft. By selecting our single-aisle aircraft, ANA is investing in the best in class, securing excellent cabin comfort as well as operational efficiency for its future,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers.

ANA became an Airbus customer in 1987, when it ordered ten A320s. In 1995 ANA also selected the larger A321, with a total of seven orders.

While passengers benefit from the A321’s state-of-the-art cabin design, wider seats and enhanced comfort, airlines profit from the unique operational flexibility of Airbus’ single-aisle aircraft. The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with more than 11,500 orders to date and nearly 6,400 aircraft delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide. Thanks to its widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18-inch wide seats in economy as standard.

Metro Aviation Photo

Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, or ADS-B, is a hot topic in the aviation industry. Operators have been diligently working to equip their fleets with the required equipment to meet the FAA’s 2020 deadline, and Metro Aviation recently made the requirement a possibility for Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3 operators.

“Metro had the opportunity to obtain the ADS-B STC in conjunction with a fleet order of AS350 B3s. Not only will future aircraft installations benefit from the STC, but we will be able to retrofit older aircraft more easily,” said Metro’s managing director Milton Geltz.

GPS coordinates reported by ADS-B are more accurate and consistent than current radar positions, and the system is easier and more cost effective to deploy than traditional ground radar. The FAA is mandating ADS-B Out in all U.S. airspace where transponders are currently required. If all aircraft were equipped, the IFR environment could accommodate closer aircraft spacing as well as capacity improvements in high-traffic areas due to more accurate position reporting for air traffic control and airborne aircraft.

The FAA has also mandated all air ambulances to have a helicopter terrain awareness and warning system (HTAWS) on board by 2017. Metro now holds the STC for installing HTAWS on the AS350 B3 to ensure completion customers can meet the proposed deadline with the correct equipment. HTAWS is a significant safety measure for today’s aircraft and Metro’s diligence and persistence in getting installation approval for the AS350 B3 is another example of the company’s steadfast dedication to safety. “As with the ADS-B requirement for the entire U.S. aviation community, Metro was able to run a parallel program on the HTAWS,” added Geltz. “While the industry has been installing various terrain warning systems, some which include the exact same equipment under field approval, the FAA Rule requires all installations to meet STC/TSO criteria.”

As a leader in the aviation industry, Metro is constantly on the forefront of proposed rules and regulations. Metro began equipping its operational fleet with the North Flight Data Systems flight data monitoring equipment in 2009, ahead of the FAA’s requirement for the equipment to be installed on all helicopter emergency medical services aircraft, and was the first to equip its entire fleet with night vision goggles.

The FAA’s final rule for the air ambulance sector comes five years after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) highlighted the industry’s accident rate. The final ruling addresses most of the NTSB’s safety recommendations for air ambulances.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7730885744094849}",neutral,0.7730885744094849,0

"A lighter, cheaper satellite - Cosmos","Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vY29zbW9zbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYS1saWdodGVyLWNoZWFwZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Zephyr 7 has a 23-metre wingspan and weighs a mere 53 kilos. It can be launched by human hands and can reach an altitude of 21 kilometres. – Airbus

Getting into space isn’t easy. Rocket launches are expensive and dangerous, and the greenhouse gas emissions that go with them are excessive. There has to be a better way.

The August test flight of Airbus’s new Zephyr was a serene affair. To launch the unmanned aircraft – which despite its 23-metre wingspan weighs only 53 kilos – a handful of people lifted it off the ground and threw it gently into the wind. As its propellers took over, they watched it silently soar into the sunrise.

Airbus hopes the vehicle – dubbed a high-altitude pseudo-satellite, or HAP – could do the job of satellites without the perils and expense of rocket launches. Soon there might be thousands gazing down upon us from the lofty reaches of the Earth’s atmosphere.

A HAP is essentially a super lightweight drone equipped with solar cells and batteries. The idea is the HAP will soar at an altitude of around 21 kilometres, above the weather but far below the 200-kilometre altitude of the lowest satellites.

The HAP gains altitude during the day using power from its solar panels to drive two tiny electric motors. By night it saves battery power by descending gradually, reaching 15 kilometres or so by morning. In principle, a HAP could remain aloft this way for months, and all for a fraction of the cost of a satellite.

“HAPs are strong where satellites struggle,” says Jens Federhen at Airbus, who leads the work on Zephyr – named after Zephyrus, the Greek god of the refreshing west wind.

“The main strength of HAPs is what we call ‘affordable local persistence’, that is, their ability to provide satellite-like services to limited areas on the ground at low cost, permanently and without interruption.”

The latest Zephyr 7 prototype looks ungainly, with its giant ultra-thin wings, but it is graceful in the skies. Its paper thin coating of highly efficient solar cells charge lithium-sulfur batteries that can store nearly twice the energy of a typical smartphone battery, weight for weight.

‘Airbus hopes the Zephyr will provide an inexpensive alternative to satellite surveillance.’

Zephyr 7 recently completed a test flight lasting 11 days, which was impressive because the flight was conducted in winter, with shorter days in which to keep the batteries charged. The Zephyr record for remaining aloft is two weeks. As battery technology improves, Federhen expects that could extend to months.

The trick, he says, is keeping the weight of the Zephyr down to a minimum. “Our engineers look for weight reductions everywhere on the aircraft because it is always easier to save 10 grams in 10 places than to save 100 grams in one place.”

Airbus hopes the Zephyr will provide an inexpensive alternative to satellite surveillance. Satellites can only observe whatever happens to lie below them as they travel, but the Zephyr can keep an electronic eye trained on a particular location for days on end. And because it’s far closer to the surface than a satellite even in low-Earth orbit, the optics don’t need to be as large or complex to produce clear pictures.

It could also be used for communications by extending cellular networks into areas too remote to build cell phone towers – hence Google’s interest in HAPs.

A HAP can also easily touch down for maintenance or upgrades – try doing that with a satellite. Multiple HAPs would be significantly cheaper than a single satellite – which can cost $100 million just to get into orbit.

Airbus isn’t the only company developing HAPs. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency gave Boeing $89 million in 2012 to develop the SolarEagle. This is a much larger craft with a wingspan of 120 metres. Its solar panels and fuel cells might keep it aloft for years.

Meanwhile Federhen and his team are working on the Zephyr 8. For those of us who love the drama of rocket launches, it may be time to reset expectations and learn to enjoy the serenity of hand propelled take off.

SOLAR CELLS

Paper-thin solar cells, capable of producing a kilowatt of power for every kilogram of panel, coat the Zephyr’s wings. The cells capture enough solar energy to keep the aircraft aloft for weeks at a time.

CONSTRUCTION

In a bid to keep the Zephyr’s weight to the absolute minimum, even landing gear has been sacrificed. The aircraft is so light, and flies so slowly, it can safely touch down on its belly.

WINGSPAN

The Zephyr’s 22.5-metre wing contains the lithium-sulfur batteries that store the energy captured by the solar panels. The swept-back, curled-down wing tips reduce drag, helping the batteries last longer.

Airbus A350: World's newest plane takes first commercial flight - Sydney Morning Herald,"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXdvcmxkcy1uZXdlc3QtcGxhbmUtdGFrZXMtZmlyc3QtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1mbGlnaHQtMjAxNTAxMTYtMTJyZ2YyLmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L3RyYXZlbGxlci9pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtYTM1MC13b3JsZHMtbmV3ZXN0LXBsYW5lLXRha2VzLWZpcnN0LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtZmxpZ2h0LTIwMTUwMTE2LTEycmdmMi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For passengers, the new plane offers wider panoramic windows and larger overhead storage space plus the ability to limit connections.

The Qatar Airways flight departed the Qatari capital of Doha in the morning and landed around 12:30 pm (local time) in Frankfurt, Germany. It marks the debut of the relatively lightweight, twin-aisle, long-range plane, which promises to connect smaller cities with major aviation hubs nonstop at a cheaper cost for airlines.

The world's newest jetliner, the Airbus A350, took to the skies on Thursday carrying its first paying passengers from the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar.

The A350 is the third - and final - major new aircraft in a decade. First there was the double-decker Airbus A380, which debuted in October 2007. It's the world's largest passenger jet, designed to carry up to 525 passengers between some of the largest cities on the planet.

Then came the lightweight Boeing 787, which carried its first passengers in October 2011. Thanks to its lower operating costs, the jet, marketed by Boeing as the Dreamliner, has led to new nonstop flights between cities that previously didn't have enough passengers to merit such service.

As with the Dreamliner, the A350's lightweight design allows it to burn significantly less fuel than other jets of similar size. A little more than half of the structure is made of composite materials such as plastic reinforced by carbon fibers. Add in titanium and advanced aluminum alloys and more than 70 percent of the plane is made up of lightweight materials.

Airbus says the A350 will help open up nonstop routes like Shanghai to Boston, Massachusetts or Paris to Santiago, Chile.

The A350 can fly 276 to 369 passengers, depending on the variant and the airline's choice of seating configuration.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966498017311096}",neutral,0.9966498017311096,0
Virgin Atlantic Upper Class London LHR to New York JFK Review Airbus A340-600 - God Save The Points,"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL3VwcGVyY2xhc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CHECK OUT OUR BRAND NEW REVIEW WITH 360* PHOTOS! HERE.

Virgin Atlantic is the Austin Powers of airlines and I mean that with true admiration. There is no shortage of frills, laughs, innovative style and quirkiness to be found when flying the airline and there is simply no better place to test out Virgin Atlantic’s Upper Class product than from their flagship London Heathrow base.

If you are flying Upper Class on Virgin Atlantic, which we did by redeeming Delta Skymiles, arriving at Heathrow is quite the experience. Virgin has created an entire section called the “Upper Class Wing”. Before arrival you can call Virgin Atlantic and give them the license plate number of the car you will be arriving in. Once at the airport license plate detectors recognize your vehicle allowing you past barriers and into the “Upper Class Wing”. Even cooler? When the license plate is recognized it prompts agents in the terminal to print out your boarding passes and have a luggage porter meet your car. When we arrived at the private wing our bags were taken from our trunk and we were greeted by name with boarding passes in hand by a fantastic Virgin Atlantic desk agent.

Upon snagging our boarding passes for VS25 we proceeded through the Upper Class Wing to its dedicated private security. Private security was a really great touch and we made it from car to lounge in less than ten minutes without having to wait in line behind any painfully slow rookie passengers. What a win!

Once through security we proceeded to the pièce de résistance: The Flagship Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse. The Candy shop for grown ups which we raved about in New York was entirely outdone in London. Pool tables, movie theatre, jacuzzi, sauna and loft bar overlooking the Tarmac are just a few marquee features of this glamazon space. As always we thoroughly enjoyed the food and cocktails but one real highlight was the free bumble and bumble haircut!

A great Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse feature is that they “call the gate” meaning guests in the lounge are told when their flight is ready to board. Virgin Atlantic generally boards all economy passengers and waits for “last call” to invite Upper Class passengers to leave the lounge allowing more time to eat and drink and less crowd at the gate.

Onboard the Airbus A340-600 the charm offensive continued in tact with a welcome glass of champagne and a friendly greeting from what I must say is one of the best flight crews I have had across any airline. A nifty feature that I believe is exclusive to Virgin Atlantic Upper Class is the “dine together” seating. Each seat converts to a full flat bed with an ottoman but before turndown service the ottoman can be used to have someone join you for a meal. A truly unique experience! The menu was substantial and offered a great variety of food which catered to all tastes. I found the wine menu curated by Berry Bros & Rudd to be first rate and enjoyed sampling some unique selections including an ancient red varietal from Romania. As for the seat I found Virgin Atlantic Upper Class to be a substantial step up from other business class products. At 6’2” feeling spacious on an airplane is no easy task but I felt that I could truly stretch out on this product and get a real nights sleep which has been a struggle on other airlines. For the record Virgin Atlantic does claim that they offer the longest business seat in its class and I am certianly not going to argue!

All Virgin Atlantic flights have an on board bar which fully completes the Austin Powers motif in the greatest of fashions. Our flight was in air during new years and at the Upper Class bar the crew arranged a midnight champagne toast for anyone who was up and about and they joined with ginger ale. The captain notified the crew of the 10 second countdown with the fasten seatbelt sound and everyone counted down and cheered which was a really neat and unexpected experience. After our meal it was off to sleep which was no problem for Laura as evidenced by the photos!

You know its been a good flight when you wish you didn’t have to leave and that was certainly the feeling we had upon touching down. I am very excited to try out Upper Class again later this year en route to my wedding on the new 787 Dreamliner which Virgin Atlantic just launched last month. With any hope the beds, pressure and lighting will be even better which would seriously be saying something. Five Stars.

Book now.

Has anyone experienced Upper Class from Heathrow? Thoughts?

As always: godsavethepoints@gmail.com

Japan carrier Skymark's shares plunge after bankruptcy filing - Yahoo Singapore News,"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9qYXBhbi1jYXJyaWVyLXNreW1hcmtzLXNoYXJlcy1wbHVuZ2UtYmFua3J1cHRjeS1maWxpbmctMDM0MzQyMzA4LS1maW5hbmNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shares in Japan's Skymark Airlines lost a quarter of their value on Thursday after the struggling carrier filed for bankruptcy protection, citing potentially crippling penalties over a cancelled $2.2 billion jet order with Airbus. The embattled airline's shares dropped 25 percent to 237 yen ($2) -- their daily loss limit -- as investors reacted to news late Wednesday that Japan's third-largest carrier would file for bankruptcy, in an acknowledgment that efforts to turn itself around had failed. ""The company came to the conclusion that it will be extremely difficult to rehabilitate itself on its own,"" Skymark said in a statement, citing ""unreasonable"" breach-of-contract penalties. ""If the payments for breach of contract happened, there are concerns that our company's financial situation could worsen."" At a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday, company executives bowed and apologised for seeking court protection, a common act of contrition in Japan's business world. ""I sincerely apologise to our customers, business partners and shareholders for this trouble,"" said Skymark's newly appointed president Masakazu Arimori, adding that daily operations would be unaffected. His predecessor Shinichi Nishikubo -- who rejected an Airbus call to merge with a larger rival after their dispute was made public in July -- resigned on Wednesday as executives held an an emergency board meeting. The airline will continue operating for the time being, but its shares would be delisted from March 1, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ""We are aware that Skymark Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection, this is now a matter for the courts,"" Airbus said in an e-mail to AFP. Skymark said it has debts topping $603 million and faces possible compensation costs of as much as $700 million linked to the axed Airbus deal. It is in talks with Airbus to reduce the size of the penalty, after earlier saying that the European plane maker was preparing a lawsuit over the dispute. Skymark has struggled because of fierce competition in the airline sector, and its woes deepened after the Airbus affair made headlines last summer. Its shares lost about half their value in the wake of Airbus cancelling the order for six A380 jets, signed in 2011, apparently over concerns it would not get paid. Skymark, which has about 2,200 employees, was born out of deregulation measures in the 1990s that were aimed at challenging rival All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines' (JAL) control of the market. It operates domestic flights in and out of Haneda Airport, just a short train ride from central Tokyo. Japan’s transport ministry ""must be considering keeping Skymark so that competition remains in the oligopoly market with two majors,"" Hiroshi Hasegawa, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Bloomberg News. JAL received a government bailout after it went bankrupt in 2010. The country's flagship carrier re-listed on the Tokyo bourse in 2012 after an $8.5 billion share sale.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9980863332748413}",negative,0.9980863332748413,-1

Earlier this month, Japan's Asahi newspaper said talks about rival All Nippon Airways (ANA) investing in Skymark had fallen apart, and that the loss-making carrier would try to climb out of the red on its own. Skymark rejected that report but said it was talking with ANA and Japan Airlines about code-sharing, as well as with domestic and overseas funds over a possible investment deal.

Airbus A350 takes to skies on first commercial flight from Qatar - CTV News,"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3dvcmxkLXMtbmV3ZXN0LWpldGxpbmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXRha2VzLXRvLXRoZS1za2llcy0xLjIxODk3NTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DOHA, Qatar -- The world's newest jetliner, the Airbus A350, took to the skies Thursday carrying its first paying passengers from the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar.

The Qatar Airways flight departed the Qatari capital of Doha in the morning and landed around 12:30 p.m. local time in Frankfurt, Germany. It marks the debut of the relatively lightweight, twin-aisle, long-range plane, which promises to connect smaller cities with major aviation hubs nonstop at a cheaper cost for airlines.

For passengers, the new plane offers wider panoramic windows and larger overhead storage space plus the ability to limit connections.

Add in titanium and advanced aluminum alloys and more than 70 per cent of the plane is made up of lightweight materials.

Airbus says the A350 will help open up nonstop routes like Shanghai to Boston, Massachusetts or Paris to Santiago, Chile.

The A350 can fly 276 to 369 passengers, depending on the variant and the airline's choice of seating configuration.

Qatar's version is fitted out with 36 business class seats that turn into fully flat beds and boast 17-inch TV screens, and an economy class section with 247 seats, with smaller TVs.

The state-backed airline has put considerable faith in the new model, with orders for 79 more planes. It received its first double-decker A380 from the European plane maker in September.

""The delivery of this new aircraft category into the Qatar Airways' fleet ... is a moment of absolute national pride for Qatar Airways and the state of Qatar,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker said at an inauguration ceremony last week.

Qatar Airways' larger Gulf rival, the Dubai-based Emirates, also had plans to operate the A350. But it scrapped an order for 70 of the planes last June after what it said was a ""fleet requirement"" review.

Unlike the Dreamliner, which was grounded in early 2013 for three and a half months because of problems with its lithium-ion batteries, Airbus -- at this point -- has decided to forego lithium-ion technology on the A350 in favour of traditional, but heavier, batteries.

So far, Boeing has secured more orders for its 787, but the program had a head start on Airbus, which was focusing on its colossal A380.

Boeing has 1,071 orders for its 787, with 228 of the jets now in service around the world. Airbus has 778 orders for the A350 from 41 different airlines and jet leasing companies including, British Airways, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. The plane that flew to Frankfurt Thursday is the first of 80 such jets quickly-growing Qatar has ordered.

A larger version of the jet, which is scheduled to start flying in 2017, aims to compete with Boeing's long-range 777-300.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996335506439209}",neutral,0.9996335506439209,0

Airbus, one of the world's leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, it is reliably learnt, is looking to set up shop in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.

Speaking to The Hindu , the Anantapur Collector, Solomon Arogyaraj, said that the officials of Airbus had indeed approached the State government which had offered them 250 acres of land near Palasamudram village of the Gorantla mandal.

The site is on the Hyderabad- Bengaluru National Highway, 80 km from Anantapur town and about 90 km from the Bengaluru.

The stretch of land, entirely belonging to the government, was in line with the requirements of Airbus, as it was close to the Bengaluru International Airport, providing unhindered and fast access to it, he said.

He had no idea of Airbus’-specific plans and the type of industry it wants to set up and the scale of investment.

But the proposal by Airbus has the potential to turn the district into a major industrial hub for other aircraft part manufacturing, aircraft maintenance and logistics industry, catering to the supply chain needs, he added.

It has long been proposed that the district and especially the southern part of it bordering Karnataka State, had the potential to become a logistics hub to cater to industries choosing to export and import using the Bengaluru airport.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0
Aer Lingus says yes to the higher IAG Bid: What are the stumbling blocks? - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMTUvMDEvMjcvYWVyLWxpbmd1cy1zYXlzLXllcy10by10aGUtaGlnaGVyLWlhZy1iaWQtd2hhdC1hcmUtdGhlLXN0dW1ibGluZy1ibG9ja3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There’s been a lot of press over Aer Lingus considering a takeover by International Airlines Group – owner of British Airways and Iberia – with the most recent bid valuing the airline at €1.3 billion – and the airline accepting it today (27th January 2015).



Aer Lingus Airbus A330 at Chicago O’Hare – Image, Economy Class and Beyond.

So Aer Lingus has finally said yes finally to IAG’s overtures… what hoops to jump exist?

In the political sphere, Aer Lingus is still the national carrier of Ireland – and is 25.11% owned by the Irish State. This in itself is hot potato, as the the state will want to see as many direct links as possible maintained from Dublin and Shannon to London Heathrow.

Then there is the other major owner of Aer Lingus – Ryanair, who own 29.82% in the airline who will begrudge selling to a competitor – and would be seeking to maximise its value in the shares if it has to sell the airline.

The other 45.07% will need to be convinced by the cash on the table – including the small holding that Etihad has in Aer Lingus.

And there’s the small matter of the European Commission who will have the final say if the takeover can go ahead or not – and what remedies need to be made if the takeover is to go ahead – suffice to say, the London Heathrow – Dublin route would become an IAG monopoly.

So why is IAG going after Aer Lingus – well there is one big prize – The 23 take off and landing pairs at Heathrow Airport. Yes, it’s still the hunt for slots at Heathrow, even as IAG swallowed BMI.

Additional, Dublin is rising as a Trans-Atlantic hub due to the US Pre-Clearance facilities. With Aer Lingus, Delta, American Airlines and United taking advantage of this facility, for IAG this could be a good way to funnel flights.

As for the identity of Aer Lingus, I’d expect it to remain intact as a “national brand” (akin to Iberia and Vueling retaining their identities – BMI’s identity was “confusing” at best, and not that well recognised

There’s a long way to go with this – if the Aer Lingus board chooses to go ahead and if approvals are reached at all levels.

However, if they do get the takeover privilege – I’ll be amazed if IAG get to keep all 23 slot pairs at London Heathrow…

Jazeera Airways Group today announced the sale of 15 Airbus A320 aircraft owned by the Groups fully-owned Sahaab Aircraft Leasing for USD 507 million (KWD149 million) as part of a strategic shift to a leased aircraft operation and a focus on the passenger airline business. The airline business is the Groups star performer that today contributes 81% to the Groups bottom line -up from 50% in 2011. The buyer purchasing the fleet is a consortium comprising Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited and Investec Bank PLC.

The transaction will result in additional cash surplus of KWD 24 million and will lift Jazeera Airways Groups cash balance to KWD 82 million in 2015, transform it into an asset-light, debt-free company, and enable it to further grow its profitable airline business.

Jazeera Airways Group comprises two fully owned companies, Sahaab Aircraft Leasing and Jazeera Airways, which is a passenger airline based in Kuwait that operates leased aircraft from Sahaab Aircraft Leasing. The leasing companys customers also include Virgin America, TAP Portugal, FlyNas, and SriLankan Airlines.

Jazeera Airways Group recorded a net profit of KD8.1 million for Q3 2014, an increase of 22.6% from Q3 2013s KD6.6 million, making it the companys best quarter in history and the companys 17th quarter of consecutive profitability, of which 13 had record net earnings.

Jazeera Airways Group Chairman Marwan Boodai said The move to divest from the leasing business, though profitable, by selling our fleet and continuing with a leased-aircraft operation was a strategic decision to enhance the airlines business model and focus on future growth opportunities, boost shareholder value and enhance return on equity. The decision has unanimous support from our board of directors, the management teams of both our companies (Jazeera Airways and Sahaab Aircraft Leasing), and our local and international advisors.

The Board of Directors will present during the companys upcoming Annual General Meeting for Shareholders its recommendations to invest the cash surplus, including the distribution of exceptional cash dividends and financing the expansion of the companys business lines into sectors that complement the passenger airline business. We look forward to a long-term relationship with our leasing partners, Boodai added.

In an Extraordinary General Assembly held in December 2014, Jazeera Airways Group shareholders approved amendments to the Groups Articles of Incorporation that permit the Group to start new business lines and activities to support its core airline business, become more customer centric, and ensures increase in return on equity in the medium term and long-term..

The sale proceeds will be reflected in the Groups Q4 2014 financial statements. The Group had announced KWD 13.0 million (USD [45.3] million) in net profit for the nine-month period ending on September 30 2014. The passenger airline business contributed to KWD 10.4 million (USD [36.2] million) in net profit for the same period, while the leasing business contributed to KWD 2.6 million (USD [9.1] million). The Group is expected to register a non-recurring net loss of KWD 3.2 million (USD [11.2] million) for financial year 2014 as a result of the difference between the sale value and the book value of the aircraft portfolio, as of the signing date of sale agreement. Profit from the passenger airline business is expected to continue to grow in 2015 and going forward.

HSBC Bank Middle East Limited acted as the sell-side financial adviser to the Jazeera Airways Group, while Clifford Chance acted as sell-side legal counsel. Ernst & Young Kuwait advised on accounting and tax matters. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is likely to be completed during the second quarter of 2015.

Review: Qatar Airways Airbus A380 lounge and bar - Executive Traveller,"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcmV2aWV3LXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtbG91bmdlLWFuZC1iYXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It might seem odd to plonk down thousands of dollars for a business class ticket and then spend very little time sitting or sleeping in that premium seat.

But on Qatar Airways’ Airbus A380 there’s a good reason to decamp from the pointy end – it’s the elegant lounge and inflight bar which gives the 517-seat superjumbo an undeniably private jet vibe.

The sweeping design incorporates sofa-style seating for ten passengers, with elegant lighting and high-end finishes wrapped in a restrained colour pallete of woods, dusky caramel and burgundy.

It’s quite different approach to Emirates' in-flight bar (below).

There are softer materials, a warmer design and greater emphasis on the interaction of passengers rather than the bar itself being a local point – which is perhaps closer to the boutique feel of The Lobby on Etihad’s A380 (below).

For instance, Qatar's A380 bar isn’t really a place for standing around – passengers gravitate to the long snaking sofas, which could also make this a more comfortable environment for solo female business travellers to relax with a drink.

The curvaceous combo bar/lounge sits at the rear of the business class cabin on the A380’s upper deck.

(The bar’s location also puts it just ahead of a small 56 seat economy cabin, where passengers will be afforded tantalising glimpses through the curtain of life in the luxe lane.)

So why would you leave the comfy confines of your business class nook?

The spacious lounge offers an escape from the more commonplace airplane environment, plus some top shelf spirits if you'd like a tipple while you relax.

It also pours Krug champagne, which is a cut above the Billecart-Salmon and Taittinger Rose offered in the business class cabin – a significant drawcard to fans of the fizz.

The attendants can also whip up espresso coffee including a cappuccino or latte.

While there’s a small selection of appetisers served at the bar, simpler dishes from the business class menu – such as a cheese platter – can be delivered to the lounge instead of your seat.

I was pleasantly surprised to find AC power sockets at each end of the two window-side lounges for charging your laptop, although USB ports to top up your tablet would be a welcome addition.

Electronic window shades with two settings let you block the bright outside light to give the lounge a more, well, ‘lounge-like’ ambience.

Qatar Airways’ Airbus A380s currently fly from the airline’s home port of Doha to London, Paris and Bangkok, with New York tagged as a likely future route.

Qatar Airways officially welcomes the new A350 XWB - Wings,"Wed, 07 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmdzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtb2ZmaWNpYWxseS13ZWxjb21lcy10aGUtbmV3LWEzNTAteHdiLTExNDQ1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jan. 7, 2015, Ottawa - The world's richest nation, Qatar, has a long history as a leading exporter of precious pearls – and now its national airline has one more gem to add to its illustrious fleet.

Qatar Airways officially introduced its new A350 XWB jetliner today in front of group more than 150 journalists from every corner of the globe. Qatar Airways’ group chief executive Akbar Al Baker, Didier Evrad, Airbus executive vice president head of programs and Eric Schultz, Rolls Royce’s president of civil large engines, were all on hand to answer a plethora of questions from the room, covering everything from aircraft development, deployment, future growth, aviation safety and more.

Al Baker, a passionate aviation advocate and driven leader of the rapidly growing Qatar Airways, was understandably exited and pleased the long-awaited AW350 XWB has finally made it into service. With the addition of the A350, Qatar is the world’s only commercial airline to operate every member of Airbus’ modern portfolio, comprised of the A320, A330 Freighter, A319LR, A321, A340, and A380 families.

“We are ready to commence operations with the A350 XWB and are delighted to introduce another level of service to our fleet,” Al Baker said. “The engineering design team of the A350 XWB is modern, technologically refined and spacious, and we are proud to welcome yet another fine airplane into the Qatar Airways fleet.”

As the global launch customer to the A350 XWB, Qatar Airways will be the only airline to fly this aircraft type for the foreseeable future. The first commercial service is set for January 15 on the Doha, Qatar to Frankfurt, Germany route.

The company played a key role in its cutting edge design, working closely with Airbus in a number of areas including the flight deck and creating just the right passenger experience. To that end, the A350 XWB features a two-class configuration with 36 business class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration, featuring 80-inch fully flat beds and 17-inch HD in-flight entertainment screens. Economy class – arguably one of the finest in the skies – will make up 247 seats, each 18-inches wide in a 3-3-3 configuration with up to 32-inch pitch.

Having just toured the aircraft, with several other “kid-in-the-candy-store journalists from around the world, it is clear that this isn’t simply an unpleasant “drop” from business class to economy – all passengers can expect creature comforts and some of the finest service in the skies.

Of note, the technologically advanced aircraft is made from 70 per cent composite material and titanium, making it both economical and easy to maintain. The aircraft’s innovative all-carbon fibre reinforced plastic fuselage also results in lower fuel burn.

The A350 XWB is certainly a game-changer and for the tiny but powerful country of Qatar, it’s one more gem that sets it apart on the world stage.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995587468147278}",neutral,0.9995587468147278,0
Airbus A350 launch customer Qatar Airways Cathay Pacific Etihad United - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 07 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC1sYXVuY2gtYWlybGluZS10by1iZS1xYXRhci1pbi0yMDE30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways will be the first airline to fly the Airbus A350-1000, giving the fast-growing Gulf airline a prestigious double crown as launch customer for both the initial A350-900 and its larger longer-range sibling.

""The A350-1000 is next on its way, and yet again Qatar Airways will be first airline to receive the A350-1000, which should be entering service in 2017"" said Mike Bausor, A350 WXB Marketing Director, speaking at today's official launch of the Qatar A350 in Doha.

Cathay Pacific, Etihad and United Airlines have also signed on the dotted line for the A350-1000, which will carry an estimated 350 passengers in a three-class layout compared to around 310 passengers in the A350-900.

This of course depends on how each airline configures their A350 cabins: Qatar's spacious 36 business class seats (above) and 247 18- inch wide economy seats brings the tally to 283 passengers.

Qatar's A350-1000 will feature Qatar's next generation business class, which Qatar CEO Akbar Al Baker described to Australian Business Traveller as a 'business class bedroom' offering a double bed at a business class fare.""

The Airbus A380 will be the only jet in Qatar's fleet boasting first class.

“Our premium travel is business travel, mostly, so we will keep a very limited number of first class seats, only in the A380, and all the other airplanes will only have a business class product"" Al Baker said.

“We have decided that we better not have first class, but give a very good business class product, and that is what we are doing – we are really giving a first class product with a business class price.”

Airline review: Croatia Airlines economy - Sydney Morning Herald,"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2FpcmxpbmUtcmV2aWV3LWNyb2F0aWEtYWlybGluZXMtZWNvbm9teS0yMDE1MDEyNi0xMnkwbnQuaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2FpcmxpbmUtcmV2aWV3LWNyb2F0aWEtYWlybGluZXMtZWNvbm9teS0yMDE1MDEyNi0xMnkwbnQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Economy. DURATION One hour, 50 minutes. FREQUENCY Daily.

THE SEAT Economy seat 9A. The seat has a pitch of 30 inches and width of 17 inches. Croatia Airlines offered a standard level of comfort. I was able to work comfortably on my laptop until the seat in front of me reclined. BAGGAGE Economy passengers may check one bag up to 23 kilograms free. They may also take one carry-on bag, up to 8 kilograms, onboard. Penalties for excess baggage are harsh and strictly enforced. My suitcase of 26 kilograms incurred an excess charge of 75 euros, payable immediately in cash. As my Star Alliance Silver membership grants me the privilege of taking an extra 10 kilograms for free on many airlines (including, for example, Thai) this seemed particularly draconian and offensive.

I was thoroughly unimpressed with the reaction to my request for a courtesy waiver of the excess charge. ""Star Alliance Silver membership means nothing here,"" the frosty check-in clerk said. I'll be sure to remember that next time I'm booking a flight. Onboard literature promotes the airline's membership in another scheme, Miles & More, ""the greatest frequent flyer programme in Europe"". Miles are credited for flights of all Star Alliance members and other airline partners, as well as for applicable car rental and hotel stays. COMFORT The aircraft cabin design is no-flair and functional, with navy leather seats and grey curtain dividers. Six seats to a row, configured as three seats either side of a single aisle. This Airbus A319-100 had a total of 144 seats. ENTERTAINMENT

No seat-back TVs and no inflight radio programming. Several overhead TVs throughout the cabin screened tourist promotion videos about Croatian destinations. The inflight magazine, Croatia, (in English and Croatian) featured a mix of self-congratulatory stories about the airline's recent 25th anniversary and a collection of destination marketing advertorials. THE SERVICE Meh. After the downright rude treatment at check-in, it would have taken a charm offensive to turn my frown upside down. This was not forthcoming. The service was fine, if completely unmemorable. Flight attendants (all female) wore pale blue apron smocks over their red-white-and-blue uniforms. A little more chic, a little less straight-from-the-kitchen might help to create a more cosmopolitan presence on the global aviation stage.

FOOD Our 11.30am departure had created in me an expectation that a hot lunch would be served. No such luck. Instead, we were each handed a sad little package of four green olives and cheese doused in oil, accompanied by bite-sized brown crackers in the shape of a ""Q"". The crackers bore an unfortunate visual resemblance to dog poo. A drink service came through the cabin once, offering soft drinks and hot tea or coffee. For those gluttonous types not satisfied with four olives for lunch, a menu of food and drinks was offered for purchase. Coffee and a muffin for €4, Pringles and a Coke for €5, or tinned tuna salad and wine for €10. Trusty reconstituted soup in a cup rounded out the gourmet offerings at €3. Perhaps best to proceed directly to the mini Absolut Vodka and Beefeater Gin, a bargain (and a paean) at €4. ONE MORE THING While Croatia Airlines claims to be a full-service international airline (with prices to match), it is not nearly in the same league as its Star Alliance European stablemates such as Swiss, Lufthansa and SAS. Essentially a minor government-owned national carrier, its fleet of six Airbus aircraft and six Dash-8s flies to 27 destinations around Europe.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999990701675415}",neutral,0.999990701675415,0
Cebu Pacific fleet expands with delivery of new Airbus - PortCalls,"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcnRjYWxscy5jb20vY2VidS1wYWNpZmljLWZsZWV0LWV4cGFuZHMtd2l0aC1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1uZXctYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Budget airline Cebu Pacific Air has received its 30th brand-new Airbus A320 aircraft, which arrived January 25 at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

With this delivery, Cebu Pacific now operates a fleet of 53 aircraft comprised of 30 Airbus A320s, 10 Airbus A319s, five Airbus A330s, and eight ATR-72 500s. The airline said its fleet is one of the youngest in the world.

Between 2015 and 2021, Cebu Pacific is slated to take delivery of eight more brand-new Airbus A320, 30 Airbus A321neo, and one Airbus A330 aircraft.

The newly arrived Airbus is the airline’s 11th aircraft to come equipped with Sharklets, which are 2.4-meter wingtip devices that enable lesser fuel burn and lower emissions.

Recently, the airline was fined P52 million for its numerous flight delays and cancellations at the height of the recent Christmas rush that led to passenger chaos at NAIA Terminal 3.

Cebu Pacific chief executive officer Lance Gokongwei, during a recent Lower House probe of the issue, expressed deep regret for the inconvenience suffered by the affected passengers, blaming absenteeism by its staff for the flight disarray.

Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) executive director Carmelo Arcilla said Cebu Pacific’s fine will not be used to compensate affected passengers, but will instead go to the National Treasury as mandated by Republic Act No. 776, or the Civil Aeronautics Act of the Philippines.

Arcilla said it is not within the “prerogative of the CAB under its limited jurisdiction to assess a situation as the December 24 to 25 event and determine compensation.”

He instead advised passengers to seek compensation from Cebu Pacific themselves because CAB can only go as far as assisting passengers in filing claims based on their rights as airline passengers.

In another development, Cebu Pacific vice president for corporate affairs Atty. Juan Lorenzo “Jorenz” Tañada will resign from the airline effective January 30. Tañada filed his resignation on December 16 last year.

He said the airline “now has an OIC, who has been with Cebu Pacific since 2008.”

The former Bureau of Customs deputy commissioner said he is moving to another company and that his resignation does not have anything to do with the issue being faced by the airline.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999502897262573}",neutral,0.9999502897262573,0

“No airline could anticipate this,” Mr Pichler said.

“At the time of the purchase, nobody knew about the launch of a new version a couple of years later.”

In light of the announcement by Airbus Industries, Mr Pichler said Fiji Airways had made a decision to lease an Airbus A330-300 series aircraft, which will be delivered in December this year.

The leased Airbus A330-300 will have the capacity to move 313 passengers, 24 in business class and 289 in economy, 16 more than the current A330-200 aircraft.

“Why lease? Because Airbus is going to launch a new series of A330s and if we bought an old one, we would have some risk on our books because the book value of the old one might deteriorate a bit further than if there was no new version.

“So to avoid this risk, we are leasing an A330-300 series, which is a step up from the current 200 series aircraft in the fleet.”

Fiji Airways purchased three Airbus A330-200 for $1.06billion in 2013 through loans negotiated with German Banks.

The deal was facilitated by an initial loan of $200m from the Fiji National Provident Fund.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996103644371033}",neutral,0.9996103644371033,0

Introduction

Domestic business travel takes a dramatic leap forward with the Qantas Business Suite.

The flying kangaroo’s next-gen business class seat fulfils the wish list of Australian business travellers with everything from a fully lie flat bed and easy access to the aisle to plenty of working space and storage space to keep your carry-on kit close at hand instead of out of reach in the overhead bin.

The Business Suite will most often fly on the transcontinental routes of Sydney-Perth, Melbourne-Perth and Brisbane-Perth, although it’ll also appear on shorter ‘triangle’ legs of Sydney-Melbourne and Sydney-Brisbane as Qantas works to make the most of its twin-aisle Airbus A330s.

Australian Business Traveller flew on the very first A330 Business Suite service between Sydney and Perth to bring you this detailed review.

Don’t want to read all the way through to the end? Here's the take-out: the Qantas Business Suite is the world’s best domestic business class. Yes, it's that good.

Also read:

Flight

We flew on the first Qantas Airbus A330-200 that's been upgraded with the new Business Suite – it also sports a 'refreshed' economy cabin with new seat fabrics plus an updated inflight entertainment system.

There are 28 Business Suites at the A330's pointy end, down from the 36 business class seats in the previous domestic layout, with the space divided into a main cabin of 22 seats at the very front of the plane, and a second smaller cabin (sitting immediately ahead of economy) of six seats.

The seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, with one seat by each window...

... and a pair of seats in the middle of the aircraft.

Note that the partitions between the paired middle seats don't slide down – they're an integral part of the seat's design – which makes the Business Suite less than ideal if you want to chat away to your partner during the flight.

Seat

The Qantas Business Suite has all the hallmarks of the world's best and most modern international business class seats.

For starters, the 1-2-1 layout provides one-step access to the aisle – and that step doesn't involve squeezing past or clambering over your seatmate, as is the case with Qantas' current Airbus A330 or A380 business class (both of which are 2-2-2).

Another game-changer: the Business Suite converts to a 2 metre long lie-flat bed (shown in this PR shot dressed with Qantas' sleep service mattress and cover).

This is Australia's first fully-flat domestic business class bed and it's going to be a Godsend on overnight 'red-eye' flights from Perth, even though you've only got a few hours of kip time.

To help bleary-eyed business travellers make every minute count in their quest for sleep the Business Suite is also approved for a gentle recline during the taxi, take-off and landing stages.

Instead of sitting bolt upright until the plane is in level flight the Business Suite's 'relax and recline' setting allows the seat to tilt back on a 5 inch recline (equivalent to 21 degrees) and slide forward into an approximation of what you'd typically enjoy during the flight, except that the legrest can't be raised in this mode.

Here's how this position looks on demo models of the seats.

When you think about how long your soon-to-depart plane can sit at the boarding gate, or how often it slowly crawls along the taxi-way only to join a line of other aircraft waiting their turn for take-off, that's all time you can spend in a relaxed and snooze-friendly position.

This reclined position necessitates the use of a three-point seatbelt for maximum safety.

Qantas is among the very few airlines in the world to engineer a business class seat in this way – Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic have something similar, but the Business Suite has a greater degree of recline.

Of course, during the level flight stage of your journey you can hit a button on the control panel to bring out the legrest or convert the seat to a fully flat bed.

The seats themselves are covered in leather and range from 55cm to 58cm wide (depending on the location of the seat – more on that later).

On some seats the armrest retracts to effectively add an extra 5cm to the total seat width, so you don't feel quite as 'hemmed in' by the sidewall.

Not all seats get the vanishing armrest, however – only those with an armrest facing the aisle can do this trick, which is roughly half of all 28 Business Suites on the A330.

Want to make sure you get a solid serve of shut-eye? Hit the 'Do Not Disturb' button on the seat's control panel and the seat number glows red so that flight attendants know to leave you alone.

There's plenty of legroom, even for the tallest and most gangly-limbed traveller.

The generous footwell ends in a small cushioned ottoman, while the floor of the footwell is angled so that it becomes a comfortable footrest once you stretch your legs a little.

But the very first thing anybody will notice about the Business Suite is the copious amount of personal space it provides.

Every passenger has their own side table created by a console next to the seat.

This puts some 30cm of flat surface at your disposal – and if you're in a middle seat with nobody next to you, you can annexe some of that vacant space to claim a further 10cm.

That's ample room for magazines, tablets, ebook readers, work-related documents and what-not.

Running along the inner edge of this console is a deep L-shaped nook for stowing more stuff.

As a result, there's a riot of space to keep carry-on kit at your fingertips.

The recess also holds a crisp LED reading light with two brightness settings, a pair of noise-reducing headphones plus a small water bottle holder, while on the outside are sockets for the headphones, USB and AC power.

Got more gear that needs to find a home close at hand?

The pocket for the A330's safety card and Qantas' inflight magazine also has room for your own magazine or tablet...

... while under the console there's a deep pocket for your shoes or an amenity kit.

The overall effect is that as soon as you reach your seat there's room for you to offload whatever personal items you wish to keep close at hand – such as your smartphone, tablet, reading glasses, a magazine or book.

This isn't sparked by purely the amount of space provided.

It's the visibility of this, and the variety in the shape of those spaces and their proximity to you, which invites you to park your gear there and intuitively guides you as to what should go where. That's a trademark of smart, considered and well-informed design.

There are also several small yet thoughtful touches in the mix.

A mirror concealed inside the lid to the remote control makes it easy to touch up your make-up or do your hair before landing without having to queue for the loo.

A soft LED lighting strip built into the underside of the console's shelving provides gentle illumination around the workspace.

A cut-out slot in the shelf helps you spy any small items which you might otherwise overlook and leave behind.

Bulkhead seats get a pop-out hook for your coat or a coat-hanger...

... while the rest have a small plastic cut-out which serves the same purpose.

As you can see, there's plenty of goodness on tap.

However, the unique staggered layout of the A330's business class cabin means that not all Business Suites are the same – while some are potentially more comfortable than their siblings.

Here's why, and what it means to you when you're selecting your seat.

First, a quick revisit of the A330's business class seating chart:

You'll notice that the window seats (marked A and K) fall into two categories:

seats located immediately next to the aisle, with the console bench between the seat and window (seats 1A and 1K, for example)

and seats located immediately next to the window, with the console bench between the seat and the aisle

These alternate from one row to the next – window, aisle, window, aisle...

The same applies to the Business Suites in the middle of the plane. Each row has one passenger sitting immediately next to the aisle, and one passenger with the seat's console between them and the aisle.

Again, the layout swaps between rows.

This alternating arrangement is necessary because under each seat's console is the footwell for the seat behind it.

Now here's a shot of the space inside that footwell when the passenger stretches out...

... and when the seat is converted into a flat bed.

I've got average-sized feet which slip into an 8.0 to 8.5 shoe (that's Aussie sizing – equivalent to a European 42-43 or US 9.0 to 9.5). They sat well inside this cubbyhole, and no doubt would have a little more wiggle-room once I shed the shoes for sleeping.

But for passengers with much larger feet – say, size 10 and up – this is going to be a tight squeeze.

My tip is to book any of the seats facing the bulhead wall (rows 1 and 7), which don't need to neatly dovetail into a seat in front because there is no seat in front.

As a result, the footwell goes from being a cubbyhole to a cavern with a generously high ceiling.

The next point of difference between the Business Suites is the width of the seat, both in the actual seat cushion and whether or not the armrest slides down to give you a little more elbow room.

Business Suites which have the passenger sitting directly at the aisle have a 58cm (23in) seat width, with another 5cm (2in) once the armrest is pushed down into the seat's shell.

Business Suites with the passener next to the window and the console next to the aisle (as shown below) have the same 58cm (23in) seat width but the armrest is fixed in place.

However, the equivalent seat in the middle pair of Business Suites – the seat where the passenger has the console between them and the aisle – has a slightly wider 61cm (24in) seat.

A final obervation on the relative comfort factor of each Business Suite: if the seat's bench is between you and the aisle, the gap between the front of that bench and the rear of the seat sell in front is only 26cm.

That's the space you'll have to navigate every time you step in and out of your seat (to visit the toilet, for example). It's sufficient if you're of an average build, but 'plus-size' passengers will want to book the seats which let them step straight into the aisle without squeeing past the console.

Work

AC and USB ports for each Business Suite are conveniently located at shoulder-height in the console rather than near floor level between the seats, so there's no clumsy fumbling around in order to charge your laptop, tablet or smartphone.

It's also a doddle to park your tech on the bench or in the recess while it's being juiced up.

The over-sized tray table has ample room for your laptop.

It's solidly constructed and firmly anchored to the console, but exhibits none of the bothersome 'bounce' of many large tables when you load them up with a laptop and start hammering away at the keyboard.

Meal

As the Business Suite's debut was a standard commercial flight (QF571) which left Sydney at 5.30pm I was offered a three-course dinner service of a 'small plate' entree, a 'main plate' and desserts.

So while this is primarily a review of the Business Suite itself, here are some notes and photos of the meal.

From the two small plate options I chose a trio of tiger prawns on a bed of sesame soy Asian coleslaw, which proved to be a tasty and sharp starter.

Sadly, the obligatory salad turned out to be just a handful of lonely lettuce leaves. Halved cherry tomatoes, some grated carrots and perhaps corn would go a long way to making this simple dish more rounded and more enjoyable.

For mains I ordered the pork and veal meatballs, served with a tomato ragout, oregano and herbed risoni (a very short-cut pasta shaped like large grains of rice), matched to a Victorian Heathcote Estate 2013 Shiraz.

This one really hit the mark: robustly flavoured without being too heavy.

Fortunately there was room left for dessert: a warm banana and salted caramel cake with double cream, partnered to a sweet Lillypilly Noble Blend dessert wine.

Putting the sad salad aside, the business class dinner was exactly what I'd expect from in a good mid-range restaurant or brasserie – except that I was flying 40,000 feet above the Australian outback.

And thanks to the large side table, you can easily watch a video on your iPad while enjoying the meal.

While we're talking meals, the Business Suite's dinner tray is among the largest I've seen – although a determined stab of the release mechanism is needed to spring it open.

This kidney-shaped table is 53cm across at widest point, and 26cm deep, with a wide range of forward-and-back movement to find best position if you're eating or working.

It's also hinged to swing vertically up so you can more easily get in and out of your seat (but the table won't stay standing by itself, so keep a firm hand on it.)

Entertainment & Service

Each Business Suite gets a supersized 16 inch touchscreen with a slick new interface.

The look and feel is derived from the modern mobile world of tablets, apps and tiles.

The screens themselves are far more response to taps and swipes than earlier models, although a more conventional handheld controller under the armrest does the job if you've got short arms or have put the seat into lie-flat bed more.

Some handy features in the new system include a pop-up flight information window (just tap the airplane icon at the bottom of the screen).

This sensibly pauses any video being played.

You can also browse the library of content and add specific films, TV shows and albums to a playlist.

However, on this domestic flight the screen didn't include the food and drinks menu which will appear on the international A330s.

The content itself is similar to what you'd get on Qantas' flagship Airbus A380s, although there's less of it because of the shorter flight time. Even so, a Sydney-Perth trip is sufficient to knock over a movie or some recent episodes from Suits or Downton Abbey.

There's also some clever thinking behind the scenes, or perhaps we should say behind the screens.

Copies of popular latest-release shows will be stored on a flash memory drive mounted behind the display so even if the connection from the screen back to the plane's media box (which holds all the videos and music) fails, you'll still be able to watch a few movies.

Each screen also has a degree of tilt so you can angle it up or down to suit your height and seating position.

There's less upwards tilt than downwards, so passengers close to 1.8 metres (6 feet) or taller will unavoidably find themselves staring down at the screen unless they do some serious reclining or slouching.

The upgraded A330s are also fitted with Qantas' Q Streaming technology, which can beam any of the inflight system's video or music content over Wi-Fi to a traveller's smartphone or tablet. The Q Streaming feature hadn't been activated on this flight, however, so I was unable to test it.

Although it's fairly common to see business class passengers travelling with their own noise-cancelling headphones (the Bose QuietComfort series always make a strong showing on any business class flight I'm on), Qantas outfits each Business Suite with a pair of noise-reducing headphones.

I found these to be quite effective, as well as very lightweight and comfortable.

They also have a novel audio connector designed to plug into a standard audio jack – the kind found on smartphones, tablets, laptops, MP3 music players and such – as well as the two-pin socket for using the inflight entertainment system.

The audio connector itself is conveniently located on the side console, near shoulder-height to the passenger and alongside the USB and AC ports.

Summary

Over the past few years Qantas has been steadily ticking off the boxes on the Australian business traveller checklist with improved business lounges and inflight meals, and at the same time pencilling in new boxes such as its smartcard-based 'tap and go' Faster Smarter Check-in.

The Business Suite is the latest and perhaps most important part of the mix.

It raises traveller's expectations as to just how good the domestic business class experience can be (read: very, very good), and despite a few wrinkles, as we zoom into 2015 it easily takes the crown as the best domestic business class seat in the world.

MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Vistara Airlines , Tata group’s joint venture carrier with Singapore Airlines , took 148 passengers and six crew members from New Delhi to Mumbai in its maiden flight on Friday. Tata Group Chairman Cyrus Mistry was waiting on the aerobridge to receive guests at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, after the Airbus A320 touched down and was welcomed with a water salute.Ratan Tata, the salt-to-software conglomerate’s chairman emeritus who wanted the group to make it big in the aviation sector, wasn’t present at the inaugural ceremony in Delhi or to receive the flight when it landed in Mumbai. Sources cited health issues for his absence. “It’s unfortunate Ratan Tata can’t be here. Vistara is his dream come true,” Mistry said.From Saturday, the airline will connect Ahmedabad from Delhi and Mumbai, apart from operating on the Delhi-Mumbai sector. Vistara is the third full-service carrier in India, after Jet Airways and state-run Air India. Apart from top executives from Vistara and Singapore Airlines, those on board the Delhi-Mumbai flight included GM Rao, chairman of GMR who was greeted by GV Sanjay Reddy of rival infrastructure company and airports operator GVK. The special guests on the inaugural flight and the return journey in the evening included a group of 12 children from the Salaam Baalak Trust, a not-for-profit organisation that supports street and working children in Delhi and Mumbai.The airline is entering a market facing some rough weather. Most of India’s airlines are making losses. A full-service carrier, Kingfisher Airlines , grounded flights in late 2012 after burning all the cash it had. SpiceJet, a low-cost carrier, is facing an acute cash crunch, while government support is propping up Air India. The market is dominated by budget airlines by 58% to 42%. Aware of the challenges, the airline management said it will offer a fullservice carrier, but won’t splurge.“Being full service … means serving different customers’ needs differently. We must do it right instead of making a big splash and getting into disappointment by serving different customers differently,” Prasad Menon , chairman of Vistara, said ahead of the first flight. On competition, Menon said the Indian aviation market has space for everyone. “You can’t start a business by being worried about competition but by believing you have a space,” he said. “Competition is good for customers.”Vistara is bringing in a three-class product on its Airbus A320 fleet, introducing the premium economy class for the first time in India. Response of customers on the first day was mixed. “The premium economy gives me more leg room. But being a frequent flyer with Jet Airways, I can get an emergency-door seat by checking in 48 hours prior to the flight and get the same amount of leg room,” said Sanjay Jobanputra, who paid Rs 14,500 to buy a last minute ticket from Mumbai to Delhi on the premium economy class.Earlier in the day, the Delhi-Mumbai flight was inaugurated by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Mahesh Sharma . “The government is committed towards the development of the aviation sector in the country,” he said. “We want the actor to grow, as it helps in providing connectivity for the growth of tourism in the country.”Tata-SIA Airlines, the joint venture between the Tata group and Singapore Airlines, was announced in September 2014. The brand name was later fixed as Vistara. Vistara’s flight launch comes less than a year of the Tata Group’s lowcost airline venture in association with AirAsia taking its first flight. For the group, the airline ventures are a return to a business it pioneered in India.JRD Tata, former head of Tata group and a legendary businessman, founded India’s first commercial airline in 1932. He piloted its first flight, in a singleengine Puss Moth from Karachi to Mumbai. The airline was renamed Air India in 1946 and nationalised in 1953. Vistara plans to increase its fleet size to five aircraft by the end of March. According to the plan, it will have 13 airbus 320 aircraft by 2016 and seven more Airbus 320 Neos during 2017-18. The airline is leasing all its planes from BOC Aviation","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999818801879883}",neutral,0.9999818801879883,0
"SOLOMON AIRLINES AIRBUS A302 GROUNDED IN NANDI, FIJI - Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation","Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYmNvbmxpbmUuY29tLnNiL3NvbG9tb24tYWlybGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMDItZ3JvdW5kZWQtaW4tbmFuZGktZmlqaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The country’s only Airbus A320 has been grounded in Nadi, Fiji yesterday due to an electrical complication.

A statement from Solomon Airlines today advised that engineers in Nadi found the troublesome sensor for an electrical problem caused the aircraft to be grounded since yesterday.

It says the replacement part is being sourced from the United States with no timeline as to its delivery at this stage.

The Airlines said plans for recovery immediately will now appear as being impacted until the aircraft is totally fixed and operationally sound for all its flights.

General Manager of Commercial and Operations Gus Kraus said as a standard safety procedure the aircraft will remain in Nadi grounded until the faulty electrical sensor is replaced and certified by engineers as ready to go.

Meanwhile, the statement said based on the current situation Solomon Airlines wish to advise its valued clients their services from

Nadi-Honiara will be further delayed.

It says this will also affect its Vila and Honiara flights which have been deferred.

The Airlines said today’s flight to Brisbane has already been cancelled with a review later on Monday to gauge a suitable recovery

plan including sourcing of other airlines-aircraft to charter as replacement.

But the airline said on reviewing what is available on Sunday and Monday with other operators, there is nothing available at this stage and they are still trying.

With the impact this has on its customers, the Airlines apologized for the inconvenience caused but noted that ensuring safety of the aircraft and their passengers and crew is paramount.

The statement adds the first students’ charter to Fiji planned for today has now been cancelled.

But the Airlines said they hope the first charter will operate on 28th this week, leaving Honiara at 3.15pm for Fiji.

It encourages all clients to contact their offices in Nadi, Vanuatu and Honiara as well as Brisbane for further updates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.994716227054596}",neutral,0.994716227054596,0
