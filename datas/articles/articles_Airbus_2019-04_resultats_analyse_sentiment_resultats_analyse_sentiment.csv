"American Airlines launches A321neo service with new cabin, larger overhead luggage bins - Airbus","Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNC1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1hMzIxbmVvLXNlcnZpY2Utd2l0aC1uZXctY2FiaW4tbGFyZ2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American is the launch customer for the Airspace XL bins, which provide approximately 40 percent more overhead storage space for passengers on board the 196-seat aircraft. In addition to equipping its new A321neos with the XL bins, American also plans to retrofit its entire in-service fleet of earlier A321 models – more than 200 aircraft – with the cabin features included on the new A321neos.

Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus’ Vice President of Cabin Marketing said: “We are very pleased that American Airlines’ first A321neos with the Airspace XL bins are now entering service. We constantly work with airline customers to improve our aircraft cabins, and American in particular played an instrumental role with us in developing our biggest and best overhead bins to date.”

The Airspace XL bins accommodate larger luggage – up 24” x 16” x 10” – allowing standard roll-on bags to be loaded on their sides instead of being inserted flat. This creates room for up to four bags in each bin instead of the current three. The larger bins will significantly reduce the number of passenger bags checked at the gate, and sent to the cargo hold.

American‘s selected cabin layout allows the airline greater flexibility in seating arrangements and use of cabin space. The two class cabin will gain an additional row of first-class seats, bringing the total to 20. Outfitting the A321neo with a free wireless inflight-entertainment (IFE) system allows passengers to select a wide-range of options from their own devices. LED mood lighting will enhance the cabin environment.

Powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines and ETOPS certified for lengthy over water flights, the A321neo will allow American to carry larger loads on its longer, more densely travelled routes such as Los Angeles and Phoenix to Orlando, or West Coast hubs to Hawaii.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers, depending on cabin configuration. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances, and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a reduction in fuel consumption of at least 15 percent per seat from day one and 20 percent by 2020 as well as a 50 percent noise reduction.

The first flight was American Flight 682 from Phoenix (PHX) to Orlando, Florida (MCO). Other routes will be added this year as additional A321neos join the fleet.

American’s A321neo gives customers a fully connected onboard experience. It includes power at every seat and free wireless entertainment and live TV streamed right to each customer’s own device. For those who want to stay connected to work or use their own streaming services, the aircraft has high-speed Wi-Fi from gate to gate along with built-in seatback holders for tablets and phones.

American today offers more power outlets on mainline aircraft than any other airline.

With 196 seats, including 129 in Main Cabin, the neo has room for everyone. The aircraft offers 47 extra-legroom Main Cabin Extra seats, more than any of American’s other domestic aircraft. It also features 20 first class seats, four more than the airline’s earlier A321s, as American continues to make significant investments in the premium travel experience.

“We worked closely with Airbus to develop this cabin configuration with the features our customers want, including the Airbus XL overhead bins, which are the largest available for this aircraft and hold 65 percent more bags than our earlier A321s,” said Janelle Anderson, Vice President of Marketing for American. “Today’s flight is a culmination of years of planning and work to make sure this plane is a good fit for everyone onboard, and we think customers and team members are going to love it.”

American has ordered a total of 100 A321neos. The fuel-efficient aircraft is powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines and is ETOPS-certified for over-water flights.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9912898540496826}",neutral,0.9912898540496826,0
"Purdue, Frontier Airlines, Airbus collaborating to add passenger jet training to professional flight curriculum - Purdue ... - Purdue Polytechnic Institute","Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vcG9seXRlY2huaWMucHVyZHVlLmVkdS9uZXdzcm9vbS9wdXJkdWUtZnJvbnRpZXItYWlybGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpbmctYWRkLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qZXQtdHJhaW5pbmctcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WEST LAFAYETTE, IND. — The Purdue Polytechnic Institute’s School of Aviation and Transportation Technology (SATT) announced an agreement today between the University, Frontier Airlines and Airbus to add Airbus A320 (A320) passenger jet training to the school’s professional flight curriculum. As a result of this partnership, Purdue becomes the only university to offer A320 Type rating in its bachelor degree program, further enhancing the quality and status of pilot training offered at Purdue University to students entering the airline industry.

“The Airbus A320 is one of the most frequently used jet aircraft in the airline industry,” said Manoj Patankar, Raisbeck Engineering Professor of Aviation Technology and head of SATT. “Connecting our flight students to A320 type training further sets Purdue apart from other flight schools.”

“We envision a future where students graduate from Purdue with the requisite experience and decision-making skills, ‘airline ready’ to directly enter Airbus flight decks,” said Brad Lambert, vice president of flight operations at Frontier.

Damon Cram of Airbus added, “We wish to support Frontier Airlines by creating a training program for Purdue University students that will utilize the latest Airbus tools, methodology, industry knowledge, and technology.”

Michael Suckow, associate professor of practice in Purdue’s professional flight program, summarized the key purpose of this collaboration: “to disrupt the traditional collegiate flight education model by creating a shorter, higher-quality path toward airline cockpits.”

The Purdue-Frontier-Airbus team has conducted a small-group trial and successfully demonstrated that A320 Type rating can be integrated in the traditional collegiate program. Two Purdue students who completed such training are already on their way to Frontier cockpits.

In addition to the inclusion of an A320 Type rating, Frontier Airlines will provide resources to re-evaluate quality and quantity of the current total flight time requirements under the Airline Transport Pilot certification rules.

“This collaboration sets the stage for another giant leap in collegiate flight education. Purdue students will be even better prepared for airline jobs,” said Patankar. “Airlines and manufacturers will be invested early in student success, and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) will have robust data regarding quality of pilot proficiency beyond the traditional notion of flight hours.”

“Purdue’s degree combines the depth of university study with the practical skills required to be employment-ready,” said Suckow. “The Purdue-Frontier-Airbus agreement is another example of how we continuously work with industry to provide cutting-edge solutions.”

"Q&A: Airbus Executive Challenges Students to 'Think Macro,' Define Their Own Success - ERAU News","Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5lcmF1LmVkdS9oZWFkbGluZXMvYWlyYnVzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLXN0dWRlbnRzLXRvLXRoaW5rLW1hY3Jv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How do you adapt to change?

Knittel: I try my best to be intellectually curious — and that means keeping up with current events, maintaining a global view of the world and being open to debate. Constructive debate is one of the best things you can have in an organization. I’m not the smartest person in the room, and it’s not my job to be. My job is to find who the smartest person in the room is on a given topic, and to listen.

How can I be sure the career I choose has growth potential?

Knittel: Think about the macro. When you’re in an industry that’s growing, robust, you have the ability to make mistakes. So, look at emerging markets. Above all, though, value relationships and diversity of thought. Don’t hire people like you.

What one piece of advice would you give to job-seekers on campus?

Knittel: You have to decide how you define success in your life and not let others define it for you. You get the opportunity to create yourself and create your career. Take control. I created the person I am today. Create the person you want to be — and remember: That can change.

Bruce: Also, take advantage of internships. I took an internship at Robbins Air Force Base back in undergrad, and the people I met there, along with the hands-on learning, helped propel me through the rest of my degree.

Friedle: And be persistent. When I graduated, the economy was not good, but I was determined. I called what would eventually become my first employer every month for 10 straight months before I got an offer.

How can I be sure to nail a job interview?

Knittel: Remember that your job is to sell yourself. Figure out what the person on the other side of the table is looking for and do your best to connect with that.

When I look back on my career, most of the pivotal moments happened alongside people from Embry-Riddle. Jeff Knittel, alumnus, Airbus Americas CEO

What has been the key to advancing through your career?

Knittel: When I look back on my career, most of the pivotal moments happened alongside people from Embry-Riddle. Knowing somebody that long — from classroom to boardroom — is foundational. Business is about people, and it’s about trust. Having the right team is critical.

Bruce: Communication. Finding common ground with the people I work with has been really helpful.

Friedle: Being able to recognize and appreciate skills that are different from my own has also been huge. Working together, as a team, we can always do better than we would have individually.

What is the single biggest challenge facing commercial aerospace today?

Knittel: The supply chain has caused a bit of havoc. Right now, we have an eight-year order backlog on aircraft. The most difficult thing for us is keeping up with customer demand.

Bruce: That’s a problem — but problems also create opportunities. You learn to do things better. We’re always learning, and everything is an opportunity.

How do you prepare for automation in aviation?

Simpson: I’ve been a pilot for 40 years, and the skills required for flying today are very different than they used to be. Automation is already built into aircraft, and the size of flight crews has shrunk. Pilots today are information managers, and so we have to ask ourselves, what are the safety implications of that?

How has campus changed since you were students?

Knittel: When I was here, this was a small school, so the changes are dramatic. But what hasn’t changed, and what makes this school really great, is the passion. Your friends have the same interests as you do, and I really think that’s differentiating.

Bruce: Absolutely. When you go to Embry-Riddle, it really prepares you. All that energy on campus, you can feel it.

Q&A with Khyati Mahavadia - Wichita State University,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2hpdGEuZWR1L2Fib3V0L3dzdW5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDE5LzA0LWFwcmlsL01haGF2YWRpYXFhLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Khyati Mahavadia is intrigued by the mystery of flight.

“To fly, you have to out-smart nature,” she said. “Since childhood, I’ve always looked at airplanes and it just fascinates me. I see my whole life working with airplanes.”

She chose Wichita State University as the place to start her career in aviation and is a stress intern at Airbus working on the A380 and A320 Wing while working on her master’s degree.

Mahavadia, from Ahmedabad, India, moved to Dallas in 2015. She considered a university in Texas before deciding Wichita State’s reputation and the applied learning opportunities connected with Wichita’s industry offered her the best position.

“That’s what grabbed me here,” she said. “I had read a lot about Wichita State University. I thought, with aviation being my passion, this would be the perfect place for me to do my master’s degree in aerospace engineering. You can always apply for internships and full-time jobs, which is very convenient.”

How have the Wichita State’s applied learning programs and your internship at Airbus provided real-world experience?

“My specialization is structures. In my internship, I worked on multiple projects which gave me a broader perspective and clear understanding in Stress, Design, Fatigue and damage tolerance, and Finite Element Analysis.

Airbus has been such a great turning point in my career. My professors and the subjects were very good material, very helpful. Also, people at work were very supportive and encouraging, which let me balance my academics and internship.

After your degree, when you go outside in real world, it’s very important to understand how things work in industry and your contribution towards the success of industry. I learn the concepts in the classroom, then I get to apply it at work. That played a very important role in my career, giving me an exceptional experience which prepares me to leap towards my journey after graduation.”

I thought, with aviation being my passion, this would be the perfect place for me to do my master's degree in aerospace engineering. Khyati Mahavadia

Wichita State graduate student

How does your internship help with soft skills needed for a career?

“Airbus also teaches leadership qualities, interpersonal and public skills, time management—all soft skills I believe every student should actively learn apart from the academic knowledge.

Airbus has taught me how to deal with people and situations that are critical and come out with a great solution. In teamwork, where you discuss things and you brainstorm, you have to come out with solutions, and not just one perspective is crucial. Everyone’s point of view and ideas are important.”

You work with Airbus Mentors at Maize High School, where they built an Aircraft RV-12 from scratch. How has the experience helped your career?

“While mentoring, we are also learning how to build from scratch, including electrical systems, building the whole structure, fuselage, wings, putting an engine in. It enhances your leadership qualities and you deal with a lot of different kinds of people.”

Have your applied learning experiences at Wichita State provided career options?

“It has opened up a lot of paths for me. Before starting at Airbus, I was quite constrained and did not know what all options were being offered. I always wanted to work in a global company like Airbus. You get to see the business, you get to see the work going on globally, not just at one place.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8715906143188477}",neutral,0.8715906143188477,0
Airbus flies into new era with change of boss - Phys.org,"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1lcmEtY2VvLmh0bWzSATBodHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOS0wNC1haXJidXMtZXJhLWNlby5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury takes the reins of the European aerospace giant at a crucial time

Frenchman Guillaume Faury took over as CEO of European aerospace giant Airbus on Wednesday, looking to benefit from the current troubles of rival Boeing and limit potential disruption from Brexit and US President Donald Trump's trade threats.

The 51-year-old will replace Tom Enders, who is stepping down after five years leading the France-based group whose 129,000 employees manufacture airliners, helicopters and satellites.

Enders oversaw the further expansion of the group, but his rein was clouded by the recent decision to scrap the loss-making A380 super-jumbo, as well as multiple probes into suspect payments.

The German's retirement package—worth 37 million euros ($41 million) including pension and stocks—has also sparked controversy in France and a pledge from the government that it will legislate to limit huge corporate payoffs.

Faury will inherit a financially sound, highly profitable business with an order book of 7,350 passenger planes, which should be enough to keep its factories running for a decade at current production rates.

""We will be working with passion to continue to grow Airbus successfully and sustainably,"" he told a shareholders' meeting in Amsterdam where he was formally unveiled as the new boss.

Analysts see Airbus as having an opportunity to profit from the booming airline market, particularly in Asia, and from the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX series plane after two recent deadly crashes involving the popular new airliner.

""They simply need to use this window of Boeing weakness to hoover up orders in Asia, if they can,"" said aerospace analyst Neil Wilson at Markets.com, an online financial trading platform.

According to industry body IATA, Asia will account for most of growth in the industry over the next 20 years, with more than half of the new passenger traffic coming from the region.

'Harmful' Brexit?

But Faury will also have several tricky issues in his inbox, including handling the fall-out from Britain's decision to leave the European Union, which threatens to disrupt the company's long and complicated supply chains.

The 37-million-euro retirement package for outgoing Airbus CEO Tom Enders, right, sparked controversy in France

""Brexit could well mean a complete rethink of long-term manufacturing strategy for Airbus and brave decisions may need to be made unless a satisfactory outcome can be agreed by UK and Brussels,"" independent aviation analyst Howard Wheeldon told AFP.

Enders branded the British government's handling of Brexit a ""disgrace"" in January and warned that a ""no deal"" departure would lead to ""very harmful decisions"" affecting the production of aircraft wings in southwest England.

The US is another source of worry for the group after President Trump lashed out again at the EU this week, vowing to impose fresh tariffs over subsidies to Airbus.

For more than a decade, Washington and Brussels have accused each other of unfairly subsidising Boeing and Airbus respectively and have fought repeated battles at the World Trade Organization, which polices global trade rules.

Helicopter specialist

Faury will also be wary of multiple investigations in France, Britain and the United States into possible bribes paid to win contracts between 2008 and 2013 that could cause more embarrassment—and lead to costly fines or prosecutions.

The inquiries stem from Airbus's own disclosure in early 2016 of undisclosed payments to middlemen who helped to secure several contracts, in particular in Asia.

If convicted in the US, it would effectively be shut out of defence and civil aviation contracts for years in the market—which would be a boon for Boeing.

Faury, a married father of three, has spent most of his career in the aerospace industry, specialising in helicopters.

He started his career in the French defence ministry before joining Airbus' helicopter division in 1998.

In 2009, he left for a four-year stint in research and development at French car group Peugeot before rejoining Airbus.

In February 2018, he became head of the civil aviation division, the company's biggest and most high-profile, which is considered the launching pad for the groups' top job.

Behind the scenes with Airbus A380 pilots - Airbus,"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA0LWJlaGluZC10aGUtc2NlbmVzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcGlsb3Rz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flying the A380 is an ultimate career experience for many airline pilots. With Airbus’ proven fly-by-wire controls, advanced instruments and state-of-the-art flight management systems, this jetliner’s “front office” is one of the air transport industry’s most modern cockpits.

Pilots from Emirates, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines describe what it is like to take the controls of the world’s largest passenger aircraft. Sharing their experiences are three A380 captains: Ali Kashwani from Emirates; Lufthansa’s Stefan Thilo Schmidt; and BK Chin of Singapore Airlines; as well as David Holt, an A380 technical pilot from Qantas.

What is it like to fly an A380?

Ali: Despite its size, the aircraft is extremely responsive and easy to handle. It also has the best stability of any jetliner I’ve ever flown.

BK: It’s a big leap forward from previous generations of aircraft. It has advanced systems, such as traffic collision protection and runway over-run warning, that enhance the airplane’s reliability, efficiency and – most importantly – safety.

Stefan: The A380 is surprisingly easy to operate; flying it is really a pleasure. It has a number of engineering innovations that compensate for the challenges that come with size, so it’s very powerful yet very agile. Though with a plane that’s 80 metres long and 18 metres wide, you need a big parking space!

How is it different from other aircraft you’ve flown?

Ali Kashwani, an A380 captain at Emirates. Copyright: Emirates

David: The A380’s defining characteristic is its scale. It can comfortably transport 400-500 passengers across ultra-long-haul distances and be relied upon to arrive at its destination even in trying circumstances like fog or high winds. The A380 is an engineering achievement that shouldn’t be underestimated.

Ali: Because of its enormous size, the aircraft’s take-off needs particular attention if the runway is short or narrow. With a maximum weight of more than three blue whales (575 tonnes!), getting off the ground requires a take-off speed of 315 km/h – similar to a Formula One race car. So, you can imagine the acceleration power during this critical manoeuvre – which, while thrilling, demands complete focus. The A380 is equipped with systems that allow us to calculate the necessary take-off speed very accurately.

Stefan: I’ve flown a lot of different types of aircraft, and I would say the A380’s robustness and dependability as well as its well-designed interface are all features that make it unique. The jetliner integrates state-of-the-art aeronautics technology such as gust load alleviation (in a sudden blast of wind): the flow change is measured at the nose of the aircraft, before it reaches the wing so the ailerons can adapt and compensate for the bending of the wings during turbulence – giving a much smoother ride than in other large aircraft.

What is your typical day of work?

BK Chin, a Singapore Airlines A380 captain. Copyright: Singapore Airlines

BK: No two flights are ever alike, but we always begin with a briefing for the crew and a review of our flight documentation, which includes detailed weather charts, the flight plan, the technical status of the aircraft, airport conditions and any other relevant information that may affect the journey.

Ali: I like to arrive at the aircraft an hour before departure to give our team – a crew of 24 – enough time to prepare it for the passengers. We verify that all the systems are operating fine and do other safety checks. Once we’re at cruising altitude, the automated systems support us a lot. We need to manually navigate around thunderstorms, so it’s critical to be aware of these as early as possible. The A380 has one of the most advanced radars to detect thunderstorms in the aviation industry – it displays the weather in 3D.

David: When we get underway, we continually monitor flight progress, fuel status and aircraft systems, coordinating with the airline operation centre and air traffic control to get optimum cruising levels and routings. We have several pilots allocated for longer flights, allowing us to get some rest in dedicated bunks. About an hour from our destination, we begin to prepare for landing and review the approach procedure for the specific airport and runway. After landing, we have a day to rest before we get to do it all again!

What do you love most about your job?

Stefan: It’s a wonderful job. It’s been 30 years, and it still hasn’t gotten old! You never get bored, there are always different people, weather conditions, circumstances – you’re never doing the same thing every day. Passengers might think we’re just there looking out the windscreen, but I would compare it with chess – you’re totally engaged, always contemplating your next move and anticipating what might happen. I admit that seeing the beauty of the world is one of the advantages of the job, but your brain is really focused on other things during the flight.

How do you feel about flying the A380?

BK: Singapore Airlines was the initial airline to operate the A380, and I feel honoured to have been one of the first pilots trained to fly it.

Ali: My dream aircraft is the A380. When it was first launched, I wanted to pilot it one day. I had my chance in 2008. On my very first walk-around to check the airplane, I was mesmerized by the sheer size of the wings and the engines: everything was on such an immense scale, like something out of science fiction! That feeling of awe is rekindled every time I land or take off and notice all the people taking pictures of the plane!

David: I feel proud to be a Qantas A380 pilot and to play a small role in the success of one of the largest aviation projects in history.

Stefan: I would miss it if I didn’t fly it. As the A380 is the largest plane in a fleet, it’s the ultimate aircraft to work on. It’s really something special to walk through an airport to the gate with 23 other crew members. It’s up to five times more than the crew you’d have in another aircraft! People stop and raise their eyebrows in wonder; then they will usually ask, “Are you flying an A380?”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9840319752693176}",neutral,0.9840319752693176,0
Welcome to the new era of connected aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA0LXdlbGNvbWUtdG8tdGhlLW5ldy1lcmEtb2YtY29ubmVjdGVkLWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Connectivity and the Internet of Things are already transforming our lives on the ground. Today, the connected aircraft is rapidly transforming flight operations, making aviation safer, more efficient and easier to manage.

In an increasingly connected world, the inside of an aircraft cabin remains something of an exception. For most, using in-flight Wi-Fi is a frustrating process, made worse by slow download speeds, patchy coverage and costly paywalls. In-flight connectivity is thus far removed from the seamless Wi-Fi experience most of us enjoy on the ground.

Indeed, airborne internet is a complicated feat, limited by technology and cost restrictions due to an aircraft’s distance to ground-based connection towers and geostationary satellites. However, changes in high-speed broadband and satellite communication systems are set to transform the in-flight passenger experience.

Making lightning-fast data speeds more accessible

The aviation sector has recognised connectivity as a crucial topic. In a 2018 survey of industry professionals, 81% cited connected technologies as a high, or very high priority, for their business. A key enabler to better aircraft connectivity is 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will be introduced in 2019. 5G represents a seismic shift in mobile services: it will be up to 100 times faster than its predecessor, 4G LTE. To put it into perspective: downloading a two-hour movie via 5G will take less than four seconds…instead of the six minutes required via 4G! 5G networks will also have much greater capacity, providing a constant, guaranteed, high-speed connection to aircraft passengers.

The OneWeb constellation, which is the first of 648 low-Earth-orbiting micro satellites launched in February 2019, is key to helping bring 5G to the skies. Developed by the Airbus and OneWeb joint-venture, the satellites will be no more than 2,000 km above the Earth – much closer than the 36,000 km at which geostationary satellites operate. This proximity will shorten data transmission times and provide faster connectivity to billions of people around the globe, as well as aircraft.

According to experts, the in-flight broadband market will grow from an annual $900 million USD to a potential $30 billion USD by 2035.

But what about accessing the 5G network? The Seamless Air Alliance, which comprises a host of airlines, telecommunications providers and other tech firms, including Airbus and OneWeb, wants to make cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity as seamless in the air as it is on the ground. This alliance aims to create industry standards that enable travellers on any flight to go online with their own devices—without struggling through complicated sign-ups or costly paywalls.

The connectivity journey is just beginning

The effects of better passenger connectivity will be significant: travellers will be able to watch and play what they want, when they want; productivity will increase; and revenue streams for ancillary services could mushroom. According to experts, the in-flight broadband market will grow from an annual $900 million USD to a potential $30 billion USD by 2035.

Beyond the exciting improvements for passengers, the connected aircraft will also bring a host of additional benefits across the industry. Faster data speeds will enable aircraft to capture and share more in-flight information with other aircraft, ground teams and air traffic management, resulting in major efficiency gains.

But more data requires more analysis. Feeding information into systems such as Skywise, Airbus’ cloud-based aviation data platform, will enable stakeholders to gain greater insight into many aspects of operations thanks to the power of artificial intelligence. This can facilitate improvements across the entire value chain, from airports to supply networks to engineering.

As the journey towards the connected aircraft progresses, it is already clear that connectivity is revolutionising the future of flight.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9896021485328674}",positive,0.9896021485328674,1

Dynamically coupled with Skywise Reliability Services (SRS) and Skywise Predictive Maintenance (SPM), SHM is hosted on Skywise, gathering live diagnostic feeds from the aircraft through its ACARS* link to the airline’s information system.

Using the power of the Skywise aviation data platform, SHM collates and centralises the alerts, flight-deck effects, maintenance messages etc., prioritises them, correlates any faults with the relevant troubleshooting procedures, highlights operational impacts, provides the maintenance history of the system (from the logbook and MIS** information collected through Skywise Core and stored in the data lake), allowing effective tracking of the alerts.

When fully deployed, and following the in-service feedback from Allegiant Air and other “early adopters,” SHM will support airlines’ Maintenance Control Centers, Line Maintenance and Engineering departments in identifying, prioritising, analysing and handling in-service events, enabling quicker decision-making and preparation of the optimal solution to ensure aircraft on-time dispatch and minimising AOG risks.

Overall, SHM saves airlines time and decreases the cost of unscheduled maintenance. Natively interfaced with SPM and SRS to provide an integrated user experience, and also ready to harness the new on-board Flight Operations and Maintenance Exchanger (“FOMAX”) data router which can capture over 20,000 real-time aircraft parameters, SHM enables end-to-end unscheduled event management/fixes, for example by anticipating tools and parts’ availability closest to the aircraft. More early adopters will join in the months to come to pilot SHM for other Airbus aircraft, including the A330, A350 and A380.

China's Airbus H135 final assembly line starts operations - Airbus,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNC1jaGluYXMtYWlyYnVzLWgxMzUtZmluYWwtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS1zdGFydHMtb3BlcmF0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qingdao – Airbus Helicopters has expanded its industrial footprint and partnership with China with the opening of the H135 final assembly line in Qingdao. The factory is the first helicopter FAL built by a foreign manufacturer in China, as well as the first H135 FAL outside of Europe.

The opening of this FAL follows a cooperation agreement signed between Airbus Helicopters and China in 2016 for the purchase of 100 H135s destined for the Chinese market. Ninety-five of these 100 helicopters will be assembled on this FAL from 2019 onwards.

Main components including the main fuselage, main gearbox kits and rear fuselage will be shipped to Qingdao from Donauwörth, Germany and Albacete, Spain respectively.

The 6,500sqm Qingdao plant is composed of four working stations, a paint booth, ground and flight test areas, and a delivery centre. The site will employ around 40 people, 23 of whom received on-the-job training in Donauwörth.

The first aircraft roll-out from Qingdao is expected to take place in the second half of 2019. Operations will start with an annual capacity of 18 helicopters, which could be doubled to accommodate future growth.

How the light twin aircraft is manufactured and delivered at the first H135 FAL outside of Europe.

“Beginning to manufacture H135s in Qingdao marks the start of a new chapter of Sino-European collaboration, as we become the first foreign helicopter manufacturer to open a manufacturing facility in China,” said Marie-Agnes Veve, General Manager of Airbus Helicopters China. “This achievement is a testament to our continued commitment to the Chinese helicopter industry and the strong spirit of cooperation that exists between us and our Chinese partners.”

The H135 is one of the most popular light twin-engine helicopters in China, mainly operating in helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting and tourism. To date, around 1,300 helicopters from the H135 family are in operation around the globe, having achieved more than 5 million flight hours.

Present in China for more than 50 years, Airbus Helicopters holds the leading position in China’s civil helicopter market with around 300 helicopters flying across the country serving 83 customers. Given the rapid development of the HEMS, public services and offshore wind industries in the China, a potential demand for 600 light twin-engine helicopters is expected over the next two decades.

Digital data opens new horizons in the aerospace industry – and Airbus is leading the way with its Skywise platform, which improves aviation players’ operational performance and business results. In addition to the airlines already benefitting from Skywise, more carriers have signed agreements to use it on their fleets of Airbus-built aircraft. Spring Airlines, China’ largest low-cost carrier, signed an agreement with Airbus to enhance its operations with the cloud-based Skywise Core – becoming the first mainland Chinese user of the platform. This airline currently operates an all-Airbus A320 fleet with more than 80 aircraft.

Sri Lankan Airlines and Go Air also have signed agreements with Airbus to incorporate Skywise Core in their operations. Go Air is the platform’s first Indian customer and plans to use it to reduce operational interruptions and maximise aircraft utilisation and flight operations – which will benefit the airline’s existing fleet of about 50 aircraft and the future deliveries.

With Skywise, Sri Lankan Airlines will anticipate maintenance tasks for its A320 and A330 fleet, allowing this carrier to track and analyse operations and performance data. The data will benefit the airline’s current fleet of 30 aircraft as well as those on order.

By applying Skywise Core, the users will be able to integrate their own operational, maintenance and aircraft data into the Skywise cloud, where they can store, access, manage and analyse selected Airbus data together with their own information and global benchmarks without additional infrastructure investment. This will provide new insights at multiple levels – aircraft, fleet, company and global – while allowing them to enhance operations through access to the manufacturer’s expertise and global fleet context.

A shareable data platform

Skywise is an enterprise data platform enabling digital collaboration across the aviation ecosystem by capturing information from all upstream processes, including design, engineering, manufacturing and maintenance support. It is accelerating digitalisation in aerospace by providing players across the sectors with the data and capabilities they need to make better decisions – and making the data sharable, accessible and transparent, creating value for customers.

A platform of choice for airlines, Skywise has already welcomed more than 60 carriers on board, some 20 months after launch. Spanning Americas, Asia, Europe and Middle East, Skywise’s international ambition is fully confirmed.

We are redefining the way that the aviation industry operates by harnessing the incredible data playground we have created.

Matt Evans, Head of the Skywise Programme at Airbus

The platform directly benefits airline customers; for example, Japan Airlines dramatically decreased the time spent on collecting data – giving engineers more time to perform analysis, leading to higher aircraft reliability. With Skywise, Bangkok Airways’ on-time performance went up from 53% in 2017 to 93% in 2018 – while Latin America’s LATAM reduced mechanical issues leading to delays from 24% to 15% by identifying repeated issues, anticipating occurrences and taking preventative action.

In Japan, All Nippon Airways developed more than 20 workflows on the platform – including risk analysis, brake issues reporting, warranty processing and material management – allowing better data-driven decision-making and creating a positive financial impact. Skywise was leveraged by the AirAsia Group to create dynamic centre of gravity targets leading to reduced fuel penalties and making significant financial savings.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999994039535522}",positive,0.9999994039535522,1

Airbus ACJ330 - Business Jet Traveler,"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 15:07:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJqdG9ubGluZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtamV0LW5ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWFjajMzMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June 2017, a Saudi-led coalition severed political and economic ties with tiny but energy-rich Qatar, injecting fresh turmoil into the Middle East. The move cut off the nation’s only land crossing (from Saudi Arabia) and eliminated convenient sea lanes and transiting airspace for aircraft entering or exiting Qatar.

Thanks to help from Iran and Turkey, Qatar minimized the economic sting of this regional boycott. Its leader, the Emir Sheikh Tamim Al Thani, was so grateful for the assistance that he gifted Turkish President Recep Erdogan an ultra-plush, three-year-old, VVIP-configured Boeing 787-8 jumbo quadjet that was easily worth more than $500 million. The gesture was significant, but not particularly hard on the Emir, whose private fleet still consists of 12 VVIP converted airliners, six of them jumbo jets.

Among them are a pair of comparatively economical Airbus A330-200 widebody twinjets, capable of globe-spanning, nonstop range of 8,300 nautical miles. (Think Bangalore to Los Angeles, 19 hours in the air with an hour reserve.) This gets you to virtually any city pair of consequence in the world.

Airbus announced the A330 in tandem with the quadjet A340 back in 1987 and developed them simultaneously. The aircraft are derivatives of the company’s first airplane, the 1970s-era A300. Deliveries began in the early 1990s, a full decade behind Boeing’s 767 iconic widebody twinjet. The two Airbus aircraft feature identical advanced fly-by-wire flight controls, cockpit sidesticks, glass-panel instrument displays, fuselage, and wings; in fact, there is only a 3 percent structural difference between the two, according to David Velupillai, marketing director for Airbus Corporate Jets.



As airlines put pennies under a microscope, the A330, with its fractionally lower operating costs (two engines are cheaper to fly than four), outsold the A340 by a nearly four-to- one ratio. The A330 remains in production while Airbus delivered the last A340 in 2011. Boeing, meanwhile, still makes the 767, albeit in very limited quantities. But although the 767 has been in production for a decade longer, the A330 has outsold it; there are 300 more A330s than 767s in service, and Airbus has no plans to shut down A330 production anytime soon.

In fact, the manufacturer recently announced an improved version of the aircraft, the A330neo (“neo” stands for “new engine option”). Thanks to more fuel-efficient engines and wingtip “sharklets,” an ACJ330neo has a range of more than 10,400 nautical miles. That’s about 3,100 nautical miles more than a Boeing 767 VIP can fly nonstop, according to the research firm Conklin & de Decker. Sticker price sans custom interior is around $240 million.

As of last November, Airbus had delivered 1,427 A330s. Velupillai claims the A330/340 (including the A330neo) is the most successful widebody commercial jet program of all time based on orders. The airplane is operated by an impressive 106 airlines worldwide.

The A330 is available with three engine choices from Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, and GE. The aircraft was manufactured in several variants but the one most commonly used for VVIP carriage—initially branded the A330-200 Prestige and later badged the ACJ330 (ACJ for Airbus Corporate Jets)—is the A330-200. The -200 is the long-haul variant and the second most popular with more than 660 delivered. In airline configuration it accommodates 250 to 400 passengers, and the two dozen or so in private hands have generally been configured to seat 25 to 60. The market for these airplanes is thin, but when they do become available you can generally pick up a nice 10- to 15-year-old one with a full-up executive interior at prices starting at $24 million, less than what you’d pay for a new, 10-seat, 3,000-nautical-mile-range super-midsize business jet.

But, given its size, the A330 has a few limitations. You can’t take it just anywhere. You need long, thick runways and lots of ramp space. Remember, this is basically a flying gas tank. Fully loaded, it tips the scales at better than 533,000 pounds and needs 9,110 feet of runway to take off (sea level, standard temperature day). A full bag of gas is 36,744 gallons (costing roughly $180,000 per fill-up at current prices). The wingspan is 198 feet and the nose-to-tail length is 193 feet. The good news is that you have an awful lot of interior space to ramble around in during those 19-hour flights. The baggage hold alone is 4,673 cubic feet. The cabin measures 17 feet, 3 inches wide and 147 feet, 8 inches long.

Airbus ACJ330 Interior

Designers can be tempted to do a lot with that kind of real estate, and that can lead to problems without the proper guidance, cautions Airbus’s Velupillai. “The risk when you do cabin outfitting is that you compromise the performance of the aircraft by putting too much weight into it,” he says. “You can adversely impact the center of gravity to the extent that you can’t fly the missions intended or the owner has to sit in a particular place on takeoff and landing.”

While Airbus no longer does cabin completions directly, it does offer design and engineering consultation services (for a fee, naturally) to preclude such difficulties and ensure guaranteed aircraft performance, proper documentation, and maintenance, and it can work with the customer’s designer and designated completion center. The company also has devised several popular interior design schemes for the ACJ330.

One popular design is called the multi-role tanker transport, or MRTT. This is often employed by governments that want to be able to use their A330 aircraft in a variety of roles, including VIP transport, cargo and troop transport, and air-to-air refueling. Sixty of these aircraft have been ordered. They feature a VIP compartment in the forward section.

Airbus ACJ330 Interior

In 2012, Airbus unveiled the Gala concept for the ACJ330. It provides for a standardized VVIP cabin in the forward portion of the aircraft that features a master bedroom, master office, and conference area. This speeds completions and reduces costs. Airbus followed this up with a concept called Summit, which features the forward elements of Gala followed by airline-style first-class seating and economy seating in the aft cabin.

With the ACJ330neo, Airbus unveiled yet another design concept, called Harmony, which replaces more traditional cabin lines with curved surfaces in a layout that features round table seating areas, a forward master suite and office with en suite bathroom and shower, four VIP guest suites, and aft seating for support staff. Velupillai notes that any of these three concepts can be retrofitted onto a used A330, as can a variety of avionics upgrades, including the onboard airport navigation system and the runway overrun prevention system.

Unfortunately, the new, more fuel-efficient engines of the ACJ330neo and the wingtip sharklets are not available as upgrades—those would require structural changes to the aircraft. But given the tens-of-millions price difference between a used ACJ330 and a new ACJ330neo, burning $10,000 more fuel per trip seems rather inconsequential.

The “Settee Corner”, a concept conceived by Airbus and manufactured in this demonstration version by Geven, is in its essence an economy class seat for certification purposes, with a substantial side mattress area for relaxing and sleeping — which the airframer and seatmaker believe will require less stringent certification as it its not occupied for taxi, takeoff and landing.

The intention is that the seat immediately adjacent to the aisle is certified to the full 16g requirement, says Airbus’ vice president cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer, who tells Runway Girl Network that “it’s very low-cost and low-weight. It’s one seat that is certified [to 16g], and then you have a bench that is only certified to 9g that you can use for sleeping. That’s why it’s light, and cheap, and providing a business class seating comfort — not at the highest level, but very efficient. You could do that for single-aisle, but you could also do it for an A330 long-range LOPA.”

Airbus’ marketing material highlights the seat’s potential use for an A321LR, and suggests that the seat is “up to 30% lighter than other full-flat business class products”, and that its total cost of ownership is optimized, with an “affordable seat without complex mechanisms, reliable and easy to maintain”.

The demonstrated version is pitched at 34”, but the idea is to consider the seat pitched from 32”, Amalia Martinez-Martin, Airbus business line leader for tailored equipment within the airframer’s interiors services section, tells RGN, noting that that the concept and intellectual property lie within Airbus, but that the demonstrator has been built by Italian seatmaker Geven.

“Airbus has Stelia in-house as a seat manufacturer, but Stelia is not specialized in economy class seats,” Martinez-Martin says. “The aim of this product was to come not for a new development, but to use an existing seat structure, very light, to just make a modification to the shape. That’s why we went to work with Geven.”

Continues Geven operation manager Francesco Varriale, “we started in September with Airbus, and we started with them by analysing the first patent they showed us. They’ve already shown us the first patent, their first solution concept, but we started together to design the seats and develop [them].”

As the first step, Varriale tells RGN, “we evaluated what parts of the seat needed to be certified as a seat and what part as interiors. This is a point we have not yet defined, because in terms of weight there is an advantage considering all the seat as a seat to certify them as 16g, but in terms of customization and flexibility, it is better to divide the takeoff and landing place from the relax and sleeping place, due to the fact that when customization is needed, when you want change you have to repeat the HIC [head injury criterion] test. If you consider, for example, only the takeoff and landing place as a seat you can optimize the HIC condition and certify for interiors the other two places.”

The seat itself is not a true derivative of any Geven product, although the company did reuse a solution that it had created for its Essenza ultra-slimline economy class seat on one leg.

“We developed since September the primary structure and all the composite shells,” Varriale explains, highlighting the close partnership Geven and Airbus had. “We discussed together with Airbus and their designer, and we worked very strongly with the team with weekly calls and meetings to obtain the best compromise in the lowest time. We are fully involved in the design, certification and manufacturing of the seats.”

“Now,” Varriale says, “we are waiting for the results of the Expo.”

"Airbus shareholders approve all AGM resolutions, Guillaume Faury appointed CEO - Airbus","Wed, 10 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNC1haXJidXMtc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWFwcHJvdmUtYWxsLWFnbS1yZXNvbHV0aW9ucy1ndWlsbGF1bWUtZmF1cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amsterdam, 10 April 2019 –Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) shareholders passed all resolutions at its 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM), including the appointment of Guillaume Faury as an Executive Member of the Board of Directors for three years.

At a Board Meeting immediately following the AGM, Guillaume Faury was formally appointed Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO), replacing outgoing CEO Tom Enders whose Board Mandate expired at the close of the AGM. Airbus announced last October that its Board of Directors had selected Faury, previously President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, as its next CEO.

“I’m pleased to welcome Guillaume Faury to the Board and am confident that as CEO he will successfully guide Airbus into the next decade,” said Denis Ranque, Chairman of the Airbus Board of Directors. “Guillaume has exactly the right skill set and experience needed to take Airbus forward. Separately, I would like to thank Tom Enders for all his achievements during his time as CEO, including particularly the value created for our shareholders and the development of our Company to the benefit of all employees and the supply chain.”

Guillaume Faury said: “It’s a real privilege to take over as Airbus CEO and lead this outstanding company into the 2020s. I would like to thank the Board and shareholders for their trust. I look forward to working with our great teams and shaping the Airbus of tomorrow, to better serve our customers, increase our competitiveness, and grow in a sustainable way.”

Shareholders also approved the re-election of Non-Executive Board Members Catherine Guillouard, Claudia Nemat and Carlos Tavares for a period of three years. Hermann-Josef Lamberti informed the Board of Directors that he doesn’t wish to seek a renewal of his Board mandate at the 2020 AGM after 12 years as a Board Member and 11 years as Chairman of the Audit Committee. At the Board Meeting, it was decided that Catherine Guillouard will replace Hermann-Josef Lamberti as Chair of the Audit Committee while Jean-Pierre Clamadieu will join the Ethics and Compliance Committee with immediate effect.

Upon the recommendation of the Remuneration, Nomination and Governance Committee (RNGC), the Board has selected René Obermann to succeed Denis Ranque as Chairman of the Airbus Board of Directors when his current mandate expires at the close of the 2020 AGM. This succession was diligently prepared with the support of an external independent head hunter and the Board reached a decision after a thorough examination of all potential external and internal candidates. The Board, supported by the RNGC, has delivered – and will continue to deliver – a smooth succession at Board and Management levels.

The successor to Denis Ranque would be formally appointed as new Chairman at the post-AGM Board of Directors meeting in 2020. Airbus has previously said that Denis Ranque had requested to leave the Board to pursue other interests upon the end of his current mandate in 2020, when he will have served for seven years as Chairman.

“After a thorough review, the Board has selected a very capable successor to take over when I step down as Chairman next year,” said Denis Ranque. “Through his current role as a Board Member, René Obermann already knows Airbus well, while his entrepreneurial background and executive experience leading senior management teams brings the right competences and mindset. René’s expertise will also prove invaluable for Airbus’ strong technology focus and his appointment also maintains international diversity at Board level.”

René Obermann has been an independent non-executive Member of the Airbus Board of Directors since April 2018. He has served as a Managing Director of private equity house Warburg Pincus since 2015 and is also a Member of the Boards of Telenor ASA and Allianz Deutschland AG. Between 2006 and 2013, René Obermann was Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Telekom AG.

The proposed 2018 gross dividend of € 1.65 per share was approved at the AGM and will be paid on Wednesday 17 April. It represents a 10% increase over the 2017 payment.

The Airbus and Boeing Duopoly: Would More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement Benefit the Commercial Aviation ... - PYMNTS.com,"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5weW1udHMuY29tL2NwaS1wb3N0cy90aGUtYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctZHVvcG9seS13b3VsZC1tb3JlLWFnZ3Jlc3NpdmUtYW50aXRydXN0LWVuZm9yY2VtZW50LWJlbmVmaXQtdGhlLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYXZpYXRpb24taW5kdXN0cnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 2019

The Airbus and Boeing Duopoly: Would More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement Benefit the Commercial Aviation Industry? By Grant Petrosyan, Esq. (Constantine Cannon)1

It is no secret that Airbus SE (“Airbus”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) dominate the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry. According to the Teal Group, an aerospace market analysis company, Airbus and Boeing make up 99 percent of global large aircraft orders.2 And large airplane orders comprise more than 90 percent of the total airplane market. As the numbers indicate, Airbus and Boeing do not have much, if any, competition other than between themselves. Further, in recent years, Airbus and Boeing have merged with their smaller competitors, namely, Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. These mergers have not faced much, if any, resistance from global antitrust enforcement agencies despite the evident consolidation in an already under-competitive industry.

Boeing, founded in Seattle, Washington in 1916, has been one of the largest aviation companies for more than a century.3 Airbus is a European aerospace manufacturing company founded in 1970, tracing its roots to an agreement entered among the French, German, and British governments. The governments agreed that their collaboration was necessary to create an aircraft manufacturing company that could rival Boeing. Today, these two companies dominate an industry which, fifty years ago, had a number of competitors. In the mid-twentieth century, global airlines could choose from companies including Douglas Aircraft Company, Lockheed, Sud-Aviation, and Boeing.4

Until recently, Bombardier and Embraer were growing rivals to Boeing and Airbus. However, Bombardier was unable to sustain its operations and its commercial division was essentially absorbed by Airbus through a joint-venture agreement in 2018.5 The primary reason for Bombardier’s decision to enter into this agreement was its inability to meet financial obligations as its costs soared to $2 billion above budget. “Bombardier of Canada had the best hope of getting in but they simply ran out of cash and this year their jetliner was basically absorbed by Airbus…” stated Richard Aboulafia, Vice President of Analysis, Teal Group, in a CNBC report regarding the Airbus and Boeing duopoly. As a result, Airbus and Bombardier made a deal that gave Airbus a slightly more than 50 percent stake in Bombardier’s C Series. Shortly after, Airbus announced it would discontinue production of its A319 — a competing aircraft to Bombardier’s C Series.

A year after the Airbus-Bombardier deal was announced, Boeing began negotiations to purchase Embraer’s commercial aviation business. The Brazilian government owns a large stake in Embraer and, despite initial reservations, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro approved the deal in January 2019.6 On February 25, Embraer’s shareholders voted to sell 80 percent of the company’s commercial plane division to Boeing for $4.2 billion. Although the transaction must still be approved by regulators, it is expected that the deal will close by the end of 2019. Once finalized, Boeing will have total control of the new venture.

Other countries are trying to enter the aircraft manufacturing space, but so far have been unable to make a significant impact in the industry. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the leading Chinese aircraft manufacturer, was founded in 2008 and is sponsored by the government of China. In response to CNBC’s inquiry regarding competition in the industry, a spokesperson for Airbus stated, “The Airbus-Boeing duopoly isn’t likely to last forever. In general, we see China as the next major competitor though in some 10 to 20 years from now.”7 However, considering the immense investment and time required from the conception of a new plane model to delivery to a customer, competing with Airbus and Boeing will prove to be a great challenge for the Russian and Chinese manufacturers. As a result, it is more than likely that the Airbus and Boeing duopoly will continue, and even strengthen, in the near future.

Building airplanes is not cheap. A single airplane can cost millions of dollars in construction fees alone. Considering the additional costs of safety and regulatory compliance as well as maintenance, operations, etc., it is no surprise that competitors in this industry are few and far between. “The barriers to entry in this business are huge in terms of capital requirements, in terms of technology, experience, customer support, customer finance,” stated Aboulafia.8 Such enormous overhead expenses make economies of scale critical to an aircraft manufacturer’s viability.

Because of their economies of scale, Airbus and Boeing today have tremendous advantages over potential new entrants to the market — even Comac, which is sponsored by the world’s second largest economy. Furthermore, Airbus and Boeing both have completed extensive research and development over the years, and have established production capability and network support.

Indeed, Airbus and Boeing report growth year after year. Airbus delivered 800 planes in 2018, an 11 percent increase from 2017. Boeing set a record of 806 planes in 2018, a 5.6 percent growth from the previous year. The consequences and implications of Airbus and Boeing’s dominance are vast and impactful. As the commercial aviation industry affects everyone from airline companies to passengers, such consolidation and market power could have long lasting effects on prices, quality, innovation, and choice. Boeing has already announced an increase for their commercial list prices by nearly 4 percent in 2019 compared to the previous year.9

Notwithstanding the evident market concentration that has led to the Boeing and Airbus duopoly, there is debate whether increased competition will ultimately benefit or harm airlines and passengers. On the one hand, competition is integral to any successful, productive market as it ensures lower prices for consumers and enhances quality and innovation. On the other hand, critics of stronger enforcement argue that while competition is preferable in most cases, the aviation industry is unique and basic economic and competition principles do not apply in this space as they would not only harm competition, but also harm airlines and passengers as well as entire countries’ economies.

One of the leading arguments against strict antitrust enforcement in the aircraft manufacturing industry is that, because Airbus and other aircraft manufacturers are either government-subsidized or state-owned, it is very difficult for private companies like Boeing to compete with wealthy governments. For instance, Robert D. Atkinson, President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a public policy think tank, discussed why more competition in the aircraft industry would result in negative consequences.10 He argued that increased competition by foreign companies will harm U.S. aerospace companies, U.S. consumers, and, ultimately, the U.S. economy.

According to Atkinson, those who view the Airbus and Boeing duopoly, including their recent mergers with Embraer and Bombardier, as anticompetitive are essentially following a simplistic approach to antitrust enforcement. He wrote, “When it comes to aviation, Economics 101 is a children’s fairy tale.” He explained that the aviation industry is unique, and that Boeing’s competitors are “deep-pocketed rivals backed by governments.”11 It is true that Airbus was formed by the governments of France, England, and Germany, and has received many government subsidies since its inception. Additionally, many European airlines purchase most of their airplanes from Airbus. In fact, Atkinson points out that in the early 2010s, Air France operated a fleet that was 71 percent Airbus; Lufthansa’s fleet was 62 percent Airbus; Alitalia’s 71 percent; and Iberia’s 100 percent.12 In comparison, the percentage of Airbus airplanes purchased by various non-European airlines was much lower – ranging from 13-29 percent.13

Another government-subsidized aircraft manufacturer is China’s Comac. Comac is a state-sponsored company that started with $2.8 billion in capital from the central government of China. To date, the company has received various subsidies and other benefits from state and regional governments.14 Financial and other assistance from the Chinese government will contribute greatly to the strength and growth of Comac. In his article, Atkinson states, “[t]he free market would never ever have funded the creation of Comac.”15

Those who oppose more competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry argue that Boeing will no longer be competitive in a market where its rivals are all supported by their respective governments. They further argue that consumers will be worse off because, as demand and therefore production decreases for Boeing, its prices will increase to compensate for the loss of economies of scale.16

Other opponents of more aggressive antitrust enforcement in the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry argue that consolidation is just simple economics. They claim that, because it requires enormous capital to design, plan, and build an airplane, and enormous scale to compete, the aircraft manufacturing industry is unique and antitrust enforcement agencies should not apply the same principles as are applied to other industries.17

The question thus remains the same: should antitrust enforcement agencies exercise more vigor in blocking mergers and in prosecuting other potentially anticompetitive conduct in the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry? Or will doing so leave domestic companies, consumers, and the economy worse off? One thing is for sure: Airbus and Boeing have strongholds in the market, at least for the foreseeable future. As discussed above, their duopoly has only strengthened in recent years as a result of their mergers with Bombardier and Embraer. As Aboulafia stated, the commercial aviation industry is “one of the most efficient duopolies ever in the history of manufacturing.”18

Airbus expands Hamburg A350 Customer Definition Centre - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWV4cGFuZHMtaGFtYnVyZy1hMzUwLWN1c3RvbWVyLWRlZmluaXRpb24tY2VudHJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Inside a heritage pre-WWI hangar at Airbus’ German factory headquarters now sits the extended and rebranded Airspace Customer Definition Centre, a high-tech hub for airlines, suppliers and Airbus to conceptualize, refine, test and customize their cabins. The A320 and A330 are joining the previous site for the A350 XWB, resulting in the addition of the “Airspace” cabin brand to the centre.

“It’s really building on the success of the A350 Customer Definition Centre,” senior vice president for marketing and customer affairs François Caudron told Runway Girl Network in an interview at the event. “That has really demonstrated that customers love it — they really get inspired, it helps them making the right decisions, and therefore when we ramped up on the A320 and A330 we needed to offer a consistent experience.”

“We have a consistent offering,” Caudron explained. “Airspace cabins are being deployed on the A330 and A320. It’s about consistency in the ways of working and experience throughout the definition. The A330 was a no-brainer, because they work side-by-side with the A350. The A320, what really pushes it is the success of the A321, and the A321LR in particular. We’re going to be seeing a lot more of those flying transatlantic routes, which means the A321 is coming into widebody territory, so you need to rethink your cabin offering.”

Four and a half square kilometres of space over two floors includes 3D visualization rooms, VR cabin spaces, real-world mockups with seats from a half-dozen linefit and retrofit manufacturers, materials and finish spaces, digital mockups, and floor projection systems for all three aircraft types. With a focus on collaborative working, breakout areas, technology and interactivity, the space is impressive, with media including Runway Girl Network escorted through mockup after mockup, digital room after digital room on an hours-long tour.

Highlights from a modern #PaxEx perspective include CATIA-based digital cabin CGI systems in 2D, 3D and VR, which can be loaded with a variety of inputs from sub-suppliers including seats, lavatories, galleys and other monuments, and tested for changes immediately: swap out seat X for seat Y and see how that changes the cabin, for example.

Real-world mockups, too, are crucial to the experience, with multiple sets of frames for each aircraft family. Impressively, the Airbus A320 version includes the rear door sections of its highest-density 188-seater LOPA, where the rear two seats stick out somewhat towards the Space-Flex lavatories mounted in the rear bulkhead.

The Airbus staffer demonstrating the products was very clear on the purpose of this mockup: it is to ensure that airlines going for a max-pax configuration know precisely what they’re purchasing.

Notable also by its presence was a mockup of the pre-Airspace A320 fuselage but with the new XL bins that are available now for order. Here, too, airlines can see exactly what’s on offer and discuss human dynamics: will flight attendants with body size profiles in their region be able to reach the bins, for example?

Airbus will run multiple airlines through the new centre at the same time, with centre staffers suggesting between 2-3 customers per week for a total duration of perhaps 2-3 weeks for an A350.

In addition, Airbus will also continue to seek feedback and strategic guidance from the airlines at the ACDC, says François Caudron. “We run four times a year the Customer Experience Teams: those are places where we actually ask customers to explore concepts, to validate some of them. We get them to help us understand their expectations. We capture their needs, we capture their wishes. That helps us setting the market trends for the coming years.”

For airlines, making more Airbus aircraft behave like each other is a big win. “When you develop a common cabin control device like the CIDS at the front where you control the cabin, lighting, air conditioning and temperature, you want to put it across the board because then it generates some savings for the airline in terms of training of their crew, interoperability, deploying them from one aircraft to another,” Caudron explained to RGN.

“Commonality is not only in the cockpit,” Caudron said. “It also works in the cabin.”

Perfect fit: Why American's new Airbus A321neo is the right plane at the right time - American Airlines Newsroom,"Mon, 08 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWEuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMTkvUGVyZmVjdC1maXQtV2h5LUFtZXJpY2Fucy1uZXctQWlyYnVzLUEzMjFuZW8taXMtdGhlLXJpZ2h0LXBsYW5lLWF0LXRoZS1yaWdodC10aW1lL2RlZmF1bHQuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Captain Craig D.K. Jones noticed one of the remarkable things about the Airbus A321neo when he piloted it on its very first American Airlines flight, the Feb. 1 delivery trip from Hamburg, Germany (XFW) to Pittsburgh (PIT). “When we got to Pittsburgh we had enough fuel for three more hours,” he said. With fuel efficiency that is 15 percent better than previous A321s, the neo is a fuel-sipper. The first customers flew on American’s first A321neo from Phoenix (PHX) to Orlando, Florida (MCO) and back on April 2. For them, the neo offers a modern, connected experience with power at every seat, high-speed Wi-Fi and free wireless entertainment. It also has lots of premium seats, including 20 in first class and 47 in Main Cabin Extra. The neo’s fuel efficiency pays off for customers and for American in ways that might be less obvious, but are just as important. First flight Read about customer day one and see what Janelle Anderson, Vice President of Global Marketing, had to say about the work that went into American’s A321neo cabin configuration in an April 2 news release.

Craig, who is the Fleet Captain for American’s Airbus A319, A320 and A321 family, said that on one proving run from Los Angeles (LAX) to Honolulu (HNL), the neo burned 6,000 fewer pounds of fuel. Proving runs are flights before customer service begins where the airline demonstrates to the FAA that it can operate the aircraft and handle it on the ground.

Much of the fuel efficiency comes from the new, more efficient CFM LEAP-1A engines. The neo — which stands for new engine option — also gains fuel efficiency from an improved climb rate over the older A321 aircraft. The LEAP-1A engines enable the neo to reach higher, more fuel efficient altitudes much faster.

The lower fuel burn is more than just a cost savings for the airline. It means greater range of roughly 400 to 500 nautical miles compared to the current A321. Here’s why that matters:

The neo can be dispatched with less fuel compared to earlier A321s. That leaves more weight-carrying capacity for cargo and customers. This is a factor on routes such as PHX to Anchorage, Alaska (ANC), which the neo is scheduled to fly this summer, according to Dave Scott, Managing Director of Network Scheduling and Operations for American.

That also makes the neo perfect for routes such as PHX to Hawaii, which it will begin flying this fall as it replaces Boeing 757s on that route. Lower fuel costs are one reason the neo is 20 percent cheaper to operate than a 757 on a per-seat, per-mile basis, Dave said. American’s first 35 neos will be certified for operation on long overwater flights such as those to Hawaii.

The neo will also fly from LAX to Hawaii. Its extra fuel efficiency will mean it is less likely to need to operate with a weight restriction limiting the number of customers it can carry.

American’s first neo is currently flying out-and-back trips from PHX to MCO. More routes will be added as more aircraft arrive. American’s second neo has been delivered and is undergoing the usual preparations to get it ready before it enters passenger service.

“We love that ability to fly longer distances much more economically than our current fleet of A321s with a higher passenger payload and where traffic demand is already high,” Dave said.

American has an order for 100 of these aircraft, which are in the “Cabin Flex” or “NX” configuration, a new door arrangement that leaves more room for seats. They’re being delivered through the 2020s.

“I suffer from the pilot disease: I fall in love with every airplane I fly,” Craig said shortly after that first customer flight to MCO. “But these new neos, these new NXs, are my favorite of all the airplanes.”

Outgoing Airbus CEO poised for 37 mln euro payout: report - Phys.org,"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LW91dGdvaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1jZW8tcG9pc2VkLW1sbi5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTktMDQtb3V0Z29pbmctYWlyYnVzLWNlby1wb2lzZWQtbWxuLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus chief executive Tom Enders stands to receive a retirement package worth nearly 37 million euros ($41 million), an investor advisory firm said

The chief executive of European aerospace giant Airbus stands to receive a 37 million euro ($41 million) severance package when he steps down next week, according to calculations by an investor advisory firm released Tuesday.

The company acknowledged the ""soundness"" of the calculations made by Proxinvest, which were based on financial filings under German CEO Tom Enders.

Enders, 60, will step down at Airbus's annual shareholder meeting in Amsterdam, where the conglomerate is based.

Shareholder advocates note that means Enders's package will not be subject to a shareholder vote, as would be standard under French corporate guidelines which were tightened by France's employers' association last year.

According to Proxinvest, Enders will receive a total of 26.3 million euros in retirement pay over the next 20 years, along with stock and performance bonuses valued at 7.3 million.

He will also benefit from a one-year noncompete clause worth 3.2 million.

""That's a pretty costly noncompete clause, 12 months goes by fast,"" Proxinvest's director Loic Dessaint told AFP.

""If he wants to advise another company in a year and a half, he has the right,"" he said.

In total Enders's package would be worth 36.8 million euros.

The amount is likely to raise eyebrows in France, not least because the French government owns an 11 percent stake in the aircraft group, along with Germany's 11 percent and Spain's 4.2 percent.

Media reports claim that Enders announced his resignation after failing to win board backing for a new term.

Although Airbus posted a 30 percent surge in net profit last year to just over three billion euros, it has recently been confronted with a series of setbacks.

In December, the French newspaper Le Monde said US authorities were investigating the firm for suspected bribery and corruption, exposing it to billions of dollars in potential fines.

Last year Airbus paid 81 million euros to settle a German inquiry into the suspected kickbacks in the sale of Eurofighter jets to Austria.

Its offices were also raided last year as part of an inquiry into alleged influence-peddling related to helicopter sales to Kazakhstan.

And last year Airbus pulled the plug on its A380 superjumbo after it failed to win over enough clients, forcing it to announce more than 3,000 job cuts.

Earlier this year French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire pressured the board of Renault, in which France owns a 15 percent stake, to curb the severance pay for CEO Carlos Ghosn.

Ghosn, who awaits a Japanese trial on charges of under-reporting millions of dollars in pay as head of Renault's partner Nissan, was poised to receive tens of millions of euros upon his retirement.

But Renault's board later vowed to block the bulk of the package, including millions of stock options, to avoid the prospect of an embarrassing ""golden parachute"".

Airbus v. Boeing at the WTO: Only the lawyers win - Phys.org,"Tue, 09 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctd3RvLWxhd3llcnMuaHRtbNIBO2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctd3RvLWxhd3llcnMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world's two aviation giants Boeing and Airbus do not face each other directly at the WTO—Boeing is represented by the US and the EU acts for Airbus

The tit-for-tat legal battle between Airbus and Boeing at the World Trade Organization could, after 15 years, be fairly described as epic.

When Airbus scored a major win in 2016, the company's own chief executive Tom Enders said the protracted WTO tussle ""benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ for more than a decade"".

The world's two aviation giants do not face each other directly at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, with Boeing represented by the United States and the European Union acting for Airbus.

The hostilities have continued unabated since 2004, when Washington declared that a 1992 US-EU agreement governing subsidies in the aircraft industry was dead.

Here is a summary of the cases that have been brought to date, as fears rise that the row could escalate after the US threatened to impose $11.2 billion in tariffs on European products to counter support allegedly given to Airbus.

US vs Airbus

Washington fired the first shot in 2004, accusing Britain, France, Germany and Spain of providing illegal subsidies and grants to support the production of a range of Airbus products.

In 2010, WTO judges delivered a mixed ruling, saying some of the support given to Airbus was prohibited while other parts were permitted under international trade law.

The next eight years saw appeals and counter-appeals over both the substance of the rulings and then over whether the EU had adequately amended its behaviour to comply with the rulings.

The latest compliance ruling is not expected before the end of this year.

Fears are rising that the row could escalate after the US threatened to impose $11.2 billion in tariffs on European products to counter support allegedly given to Airbus

EU vs Boeing

In a complaint opened in June 2005, the EU alleged that Boeing had received $19.1 billion worth of prohibited subsidies from 1989 to 2006 from various branches of the US government.

WTO judges said in a 2012 ruling that roughly a third of the subsidies in question were illegal.

The US said it would make changes to comply with ruling.

Various disputes were then filed over several years, largely over the question of whether US federal and state governments were actually complying with the ruling.

Last month, WTO judges found that the US had failed to fully remove all the prohibited subsidies.

Brussels v. Washington state

In 2014, the EU initiated a third case challenging tax breaks and other incentives provided by Washington state to support production of Boeing's 777X, which is set to take to the skies in 2020.

It has been dubbed the ""baby Boeing"" case, given its narrow scope.

In 2017, WTO judges said Washington state's subsidies were legal in a decision that was not subject to appeal.

Airbus looks for new approaches to premium seat availability problems - - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWxvb2tzLWZvci1uZXctYXBwcm9hY2hlcy10by1wcmVtaXVtLXNlYXQtYXZhaWxhYmlsaXR5LXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this month the production and capacity squeeze on premium seatmakers took a particularly unusual turn. When Airbus revealed its new Airspace XL cabin overhead bins at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, there were two very notable items very closely together. The first was an American Airlines decal on the mockup, and the second was an Aviointeriors Adagio seat underneath the decal-clad bins.

It turned out that the decal was only related to the XL bins, for which American is the launch customer on the refitted cabins of the existing A321ceo family, and had nothing to do with Aviointeriors, although the Italian seatmaker’s chief executive Ermanno de Vecchi was keen to emphasize to Runway Girl Network that the the retrofit market specialist seatmaker is very interested in their business.

“We are trying to sell to them. Basically they are looking for a big retrofit on their fleet. They are currently looking to the A320 and A321. This is the reason why we have over there in the Airbus stand our Adagio. The idea is to try to convince them that our seat is the best. We will have meetings with them, they will check the seats, and we will see what will happen,” said de Vecchi. “There is real interest from their side but we cannot [say] yet that we are in close talks.”

Indeed, the decals were duly removed before the official start of the press conference and the show went on. But RGN’s tendency to count seats of different types had been piqued the previous day at the brand new Airspace Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg: of all the physical mockups and computer generated renderings of premium cabins, not one was from Airbus subsidiary and premium seat specialist Stelia Aerospace.

This was, Airbus vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer told RGN, “not on purpose”, and the lack of Stelia at the ACDC was “because it’s just ramping up. That will come, and it’s also a matter of availability. Also in the mockup centre in Toulouse, we would like to have more seats,” Wuggetzer said, but production is limited.

The Boeing 757, A320 family and Boeing 737 family markets are largely split between Thompson Aero Seating’s Vantage in its alternating 1-2-1 configuration, as débuted on British Airways after the absorption of BMI and seen everywhere from Aer Lingus to JetBlue to flydubai, and Collins Aerospace’s Diamond seat, seen on the three US majors, Qatar Airways, La Compagnie, and so on.

That duopoly is one reason Airbus was showing Avio’s staggered Adagio — a staggered seat that works in essentially the same fashion as Stelia’s Solstys/Symphony or Thompson’s Vantage — at its AIX stand, Wuggetzer said, noting that Airbus is working to encourage a diversity of suppliers.

“I think we need to have variety and that’s what we want to push for. If we fly more and more long range, then you should have a selection, a choice for the customers. The market is really too thin: not enough available good seats with good comfort and good quality,” Wuggetzer noted. “We are really running short in deliveries for seats, and that’s why we need to have a strong emphasis on pushing the industry to come up with more lie-flat seats for single-aisle.”

One option, of course, is what Boeing has done with Adient Aerospace in the front cabin and with LIFT by EnCore at the back, with co-designed seating that maximizes the space in the airframer’s fuselages.

“Of course you need to adapt to solutions that fit perfectly into your cross-section. That’s clear,” Wuggetzer said, but pointed to Airbus’ Settee Corner concept, developed in a new model of cooperation with Geven, as “another approach: you can develop concepts and keep the IP, but find a manufacturer to realize it for you. It makes it more flexible, because then we have not only one manufacturer that you can offer to the airlines, you have several, because you can put this concept with supplier X and another one with supplier Y. I think that is offering more choice.”

It’s certainly an unusual approach, and comes as the airframer reups on its supplier-furnished equipment partnership with Recaro, adding the the 3710Swift (economy class) and newly the 4710Swift (recliner business class) to its 3530Swift economy seat.

Yet the question remains: will airlines be as keen to select new seatmakers as Airbus is to offer them?

The Lower Deck Pax Experience Modules consists of enabling extension of passengers’ space into the cargo hold.

Airbus and Safran have partnered to develop and market lower-deck modules with a variety of flexible passenger solutions in the cargo hold, such as beds, and stretching, playground or business areas. The modules, which would fit inside aircraft cargo compartments, offer new opportunities for additional services to passengers, improving their experience while enabling airlines to differentiate and add value for their commercial operations. The new passenger modules could be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers if required, as aircraft cargo floors and cargo loading systems would not be affected - the passenger module would sit directly on it.

Sören Scholz, Airbus Senior Vice President Cabin & Cargo Programme, said: “We are delighted to have won the Crystal Cabin Award together with Safran for the Lower Deck Pax Experience Modules. Innovation is our main driver for success, and we are continuously striving to offer the latest innovative solutions to airlines and passengers worldwide. I congratulate the team on their great job and well-deserved success.”

“We would like to thank the jury of the Crystal Cabin Award for recognising the opportunities that the Lower Deck Modules will bring to improve the Passenger Experience, and we look forward to further build on our experience in lower-deck solutions together with Airbus“, said Norman Jordan, CEO of Safran Cabin.

The Crystal Cabin Award is the leading international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation, sponsored by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. This year, more than 100 concepts, from all over the world, were presented across eight categories.

An innovative solution to in-flight waste comes from the “Fly Your Ideas” student challenge - Airbus,"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LWFuLWlubm92YXRpdmUtc29sdXRpb24tdG8taW4tZmxpZ2h0LXdhc3RlLWNvbWVzLWZyb20tdGhlLWZseS15b3VyLWlkZWFz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With support from Airbus, young ideas take off to manage the rising quantities of cabin waste and their cost

Passengers are increasingly becoming aware of cabin waste on airliners as the amount generated during flights becomes a serious concern – one that takes creative solutions to fix.

With costs increasing, new recycling regulations being implemented, and a greater emphasis placed on the aviation industry’s environmental impact, Airbus has initiated discussions with airlines to find innovative solutions for waste management.

One answer has emerged from young minds via Fly Your Ideas – the biennial competition organised by Airbus in partnership with UNESCO that enables students around the globe to apply their classroom learning and research in solving real-world challenges.

Retrolley: student-inspired innovation for in-flight waste treatment

Originally created by Brazilian aviation students from Sao Paolo University (and a competition finalist in the 2015 Airbus Fly Your Ideas competition), the Retrolley is a totally re-designed trolley that collects trash and separates it at the same time.

Nicolas Jourdan, an Airbus cabin innovation manager saw the students’ concept from the Fly Your Ideas challenge and thought: “Wow, this is so clear we should do something with this. We can make it fly, especially as it combines innovation and environmental goals together.”

Airbus worked on maturing the students’ idea and transitioning the design into reality together with Iacobucci HF Aerospace, an Italian manufacturer that makes such cabin products as coffee machines, trash compactors and trolleys. The initial student concept has been refined and first test flights were performed in late 2018.

The Retrolley has several different compartments that can be customised according to airlines’ specific needs. They were created with flexibility in mind, and possible configurations have many variations, such as one container for stacked-up cups, another for liquids, one more to hold recyclable paper and plastics, and a fourth slot for trash that cannot be easily recycled.

Lucio Iacobucci, the CEO of Iacobucci HF Aerospace, explained: “As a very simple system, the Retrolley can be used on different flights. Each airline has its own approach and needs, and this trolley is adaptable to various requirements.”

With its straightforward, non-electrical and lightweight design – as well as an ability to be integrated into any galley without modification – the Retrolley fulfils airlines’ key requirements and contributes to a more environmentally-friendly approach to in-flight waste, Iacobucci added.

The Retrolley has several customisable compartments, which can be fitted for carriers’ specific needs

Dealing with increasing amounts of in-flight waste

The amount of inflight waste generated on airline flights is vast – and continues to grow. Contributing factors include the rising consumption of passengers, more elaborately wrapped food and goods, as well as travellers bringing airport-bought food along with them.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 5.2 million tonnes of cabin waste were created in 2016 – and this number is expected to double by 2030.

With the continuous growth in air traffic, the amount of in-flight waste will increase as well. Currently, it is collected, but rarely sorted, by cabin crews and nearly all of it is handed over to airports – which, in turn, send it to landfills or incinerators.

Some airports are raising their charges for handling waste that is not pre-sorted, and some carriers find it more economically advantageous to hold on to their trash for the return flight, then unload it back at their hub where fees may be lower. Overall, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates the cost of handling cabin waste to be approximately $500 million per year – and this figure is expected to double by 2030.

IATA Assistant Director Jon Godson values the Retrolley as a way forward in the campaign against waste because it addresses health inspectors’ concerns about the need to clearly separate recyclable rubbish from other waste. “The Retrolley is a great step forward and should provide assurance to regulators that we can keep recyclables free from any bio-security risks,” he explained.

Airbus also is convinced the Retrolley will be welcomed by airlines and contribute to a more sustainable future for air transport industry.

Iacobucci HF Aerospace will demonstrate the Retrolley at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, taking place in Hamburg on April 2-4.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986728429794312}",neutral,0.9986728429794312,0

Phoenix passengers on American Airlines flight 682 to Orlando on Tuesday morning had the rare opportunity to experience ""new airplane smell"" as they were the first passengers to ride on American Airlines’ newest addition to its fleet: the Airbus A321neo.

American put the new plane into service on the 8:45 a.m. April 2 flight after receiving approval from the FAA. The sticker price is $129.5 million, though airlines typically negotiate discounts when they buy in bulk.

The plane is part of Airbus' A321 line and the ""neo"" stands for ""new engine option."" According to Airbus' website, the aircraft has trademarked fuel-saving wingtips called “Sharklets” and two new engine choices that deliver ""per seat fuel improvements of 20 percent, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km. or 2 tonnes of extra payload.""

More amenities for passengers, crew

Those fuel-savings specs might be lost on most passengers, but people will notice the upgraded amenities such as high-speed WiFi, power outlets at every seat and built-in holders for tablets and phones.

Tyler Herrick, an American Airlines flight attendant responsible for helping train crews on the features of the new aircraft, said the airline took flight attendant feedback into account when designing the interior.

""We gave them bigger galleys. We gave them bigger aisles. We gave them bigger (luggage) bins, too. It’s mutually beneficial for the customer and the flight attendant,"" Herrick said.

A321neo on the Phoenix-Hawaii route?

American has ordered 100 of the A321neo planes and plans eventually to use them on routes including Phoenix to Hawaii. A lot of that depends on when the airline receives additional planes.

""As we get more, we’ll add more routes. Right now we’re staring with Phoenix and Orlando. We’ll be adding routes like Anchorage and Hawaii as more of those planes arrive,"" said Joshua Freed, spokesman for American Airlines.

The airline has been performing required tests to prove to the FAA that it can operate the aircraft over water. It hopes to have the A321neo certified for the Phoenix to Hawaii route in time for the busy winter travel season.

Airbus Reveals New Couch-style Airplane Seats so Travelers Can Kick Back in Flight - Travel + Leisure,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLWNvdWNoLXN0eWxlLXNlYXRpbmctZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No matter how much extra legroom you have, the traditional airplane seat makes it almost impossible to get comfortable. And with long-haul flights only getting longer, the flight industry is working to rethink airplane seating to provide passengers with more versatility and comfort.

That’s the motivation behind Airbus’ new couch-style seating for business class. The company says their new “Settee Corner” chair is versatile enough to keep passengers comfortable as they eat, sleep, work, and relax in the air. The design lets flyers recline lounge-style or sleep just as they would on their couch at home.

The concept is a collaboration between Airbus and the seat manufacturer Geven and is actually based on an economy-class three-seater configuration. The duo transformed the standard three-seat setup into a single, luxurious couch-style seat for business class that still includes all the usual amenities: stowage space, roomy overhead locker, entertainment screen, and tray table. At the end of the seat there’s a safety belt to use during take-off and landing and a second safety belt for passengers in sleep mode.

CNN reports that the chair is also 30 to 50 percent lighter than a traditional business class seat based on their interview with Amalia Martinez Martin, a business line leader for tailored equipment. The mockups for the seat are the same length — 185 centimeters — as the traditional business class seat in Airbus planes, but Martins says there’s potential to increase length to 195 centimeters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997727274894714}",neutral,0.9997727274894714,0
"Doomed EgyptAir Airbus 'should not have taken off', French report says - Phys.org","Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA0LWRvb21lZC1lZ3lwdGFpci1haXJidXMtZnJlbmNoLmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOS0wNC1kb29tZWQtZWd5cHRhaXItYWlyYnVzLWZyZW5jaC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French experts point to 'considerable lack of rigour on the part of crew and the technical services of EgyptAir'

An Airbus jet operated by EgyptAir that crashed over the Mediterranean almost three years ago, killing all 66 people on board, should have been grounded because of a series of technical issues on previous flights, according to a French investigation.

The report, ordered by the French judiciary, stops short of drawing firm conclusions about the precise cause of the disaster but makes clear a serious of previous issues with the plane should not have been ignored.

Flight MS804, which was bound from Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport to Cairo, plunged into the sea between Crete and the northern coast of Egypt after disappearing from radars.

All passengers and crew on board, including 40 Egyptians and 15 French citizens, lost their lives in the crash of the A320.

The Egyptian authorities rapidly suggested that the crash was due to an attack, but French officials have always preferred the theory that it was caused by a technical problem.

Three Paris judges investigating the case ordered two probes to reconstruct the sequence of events that led to the crash, with results from the first handed over to magistrates in June.

In the document of 76 pages, first reported by the Le Parisien newspaper and seen by AFP, the two experts complain of ""the considerable lack of rigour on the part of crew and the technical services of EgyptAir"" in processing the aircraft's technical documents.

'Recurring faults'

The report, by a technical expert and an aeronautic expert, says there were several incidents concerning the operation of the aircraft which were not reported by the pilots and thus not followed up by maintenance teams.

These faults ""were not signalled when the aircraft was at its principal base in Cairo, apparently so that it would not be grounded for repairs"".

""The examination has shown that this aircraft should have been subject to checks during its four previous flights and should not have taken off from Cairo after a sequence of recurring faults which were not signalled by successive crews.""

But they stop short of drawing a conclusion on what caused the crash, saying the ""study of the elements"" at their disposal ""does not allow to determine if the accident resulted from the different technical issues"".

Yet they point to suspicions that one of the faults ""could have been the precursor of a major electrical failure"".

Investigators are not certain what exactly caused the crash

'Warnings ignored'

Antoine Lachenaud, a lawyer for the family of Clement Daeschner-Cormary, a 26-year-old passenger who died, said the report showed that the crash was due to error and not chance.

""When warnings are ignored in a systematic manner this results in a crash and it becomes impossible to maintain that this is due to chance,"" he said.

""Based on this report and the investigations, there should be consequences over the responsibilities of those involved.""

The report says the on-the-ground technician in Paris had no reason to stop the flight from taking off, since no alert of the plane's previous problems had been given.

But it does highlight eventual shortcomings in the competence and accreditation of the technician responsible for checking the plane for the return flight while it was on the ground in Paris.

Cockpit fire?

It also notes that the casing of the oxygen mask for the co-pilot was replaced for unknown reasons three days before the crash.

""The replacement of this equipment requires careful checking, given the danger of oxygen leaks,"" the experts wrote.

A report published last year by France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) said its main hypothesis was that a fire erupted in the cockpit which rapidly got out of control.

A second report requested by the French judges is expected to determine if smartphones and tablets left in the cockpit could have led to the fire.

A source close to the case, who asked not to be identified, said French investigators had started to analyse a copy of one of the ""black box"" voice recordings from the cockpit.

They received the recordings after the Egyptian security authorities ended their investigation.

In December 2016, Cairo officials said traces of explosives had been found on the remains of some victims, but French authorities were sceptical, as no organisation had claimed responsibility for any attack.

Lufthansa's Airbus A350-900 flagship aircraft now flying to Montreal – Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport for the ... - Lufthansa Group,"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWZ0aGFuc2Fncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbWVkaWEtcmVsYXRpb25zLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy1hbmQtcmVsZWFzZXMvbHVmdGhhbnNhcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDAtZmxhZ3NoaXAtYWlyY3JhZnQtbm93LWZseWluZy10by1tb250cmVhbC1waWVycmUtZWxsaW90dC10cnVkZWF1LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Attached images credited to: Enes Comlekci Attached images credited to: Enes Comlekci Previous Next

When Lufthansa’s Flight LH474 arrived at Montreal – Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport on April 1, 2019, it marked the first time a Lufthansa Airbus A350-900, the world’s most state-of-the-art, long-haul aircraft, arrived in the city.

Montreal will join an exclusive roster of North American cities Lufthansa connects to Munich with its new flagship long-haul aircraft that includes Boston, Denver, Chicago O’Hare, Newark, Toronto and Vancouver.

Flight LH474 departs from Munich at 4:40 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Montreal at 6:55 p.m. local time. The return flight, LH475, departs from Montreal at 8:50 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Munich at 9:55 a.m. on the following day. All times are local. This flight between Montreal and Munich will travel daily.

“Anyone who has flown on the A350-900, whether it be in Business Class, Premium Economy or Economy, discovers that the flying experience on this new aircraft is unlike any other,” said Hans DeHaan, Senior Director Canada, Lufthansa Group. “They experience a product that is very well in line with our company’s commitment to innovation, technology and efficiency. With our A350 aircraft, we can offer qualities and features that maximize the in-flight experience of our passengers to and from Canada.”

A350-900

The Airbus A350-900 is the world's most advanced, environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft. It uses 25 percent less kerosene, produces 25 percent fewer emissions and is significantly quieter on take-off. The aircraft has space for 293 passengers with 48 seats in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class. At just under 5.6 meters wide (18.4 feet), the cabin of the new Airbus is more spacious than comparable models of aircraft.

Lufthansa’s A350-900 also offers an exceptionally pleasant cabin environment that makes the journey on board the aircraft even more satisfying. In Business Class, passengers enjoy a self-service area where they can easily help themselves to snacks and drinks throughout the flight.

The Premium Economy Class offers much more than merely a comfortable seat. Passengers can check in two pieces of luggage at no charge, each with an allowable weight of up to 22.7 kilograms (50 lbs). Travelers can conveniently select their favorite food from the menu card, and the food is served on porcelain dishes.

The award-winning Economy Class, furnished in various shades of blue, features special ergonomically-formed seat upholstery and provides travelers with more personal and storage space. The A350 Economy Class was conceived by the design bureau, PearsonLloyd, and was awarded the German Design Award 2018 by the German Design Council.

Throughout the cabin, passengers can use their own mobile device as a second screen, as well as pre-selected programs from the on-board entertainment system up to six weeks prior to flight time.

Due to the aircraft’s particular construction, passengers reach their destination feeling more well-rested. This is achieved through improved cabin pressure during the flight, as well as a novel LED lighting system that adjusts with the day and night-time rhythm of the passengers.

Is Airbus’ sofa-style seat the future of business class travel? - CNN,"Mon, 08 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXNvZmEtYWlycGxhbmUtc2VhdC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hamburg, Germany CNN —

On a long-haul flight, passengers spend the time working, eating, sleeping, relaxing – and all in the same seat.

Even in the swankiest business class situation cabin fever can set in.

That’s where Airbus’ new “Settee Corner” chair comes in, offering couch-style airplane seating, alongside all the usual business class features.

The new airplane seat premiered at the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2019 (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany, attracting buzz from passengers and airlines alike.

On these new seats, fliers can recline, lounge-style, just like on a couch at home. They can be joined by a traveling partner for an aperitif and to enjoy the in-flight entertainment.

And when it’s time to sleep, they just lie down on the seat, no mechanisms needed.

It’s part of a wider trend visible at AIX – aircraft and seat manufacturers looking to make radical changes to the airplane seat.

Transforming the traditional

The “Settee Corner” concept was designed by Airbus in collaboration with seat manufacturer Geven.

The team based the concept on an economy class three-seater configuration – transforming this recognizable, budget option into a lightweight and luxurious business class concept.

“Airbus is promoting the 321 long range – now, the 321 is going to fly seven–to-eight hours, so we need to have the comfort in business class, a lie-flat surface, but with very competitive weight,” Amalia Martinez Martin, business line leader for tailored equipment, tells CNN Travel at AIX.

Martinez Martin says the seat is 30-50% lighter than a traditional business class seat. Plus, because it uses a configuration that’s already familiar to airlines, it could go from concept to reality pretty speedily.

“We’ve got all features that you would find in a business class seat,” she adds.

There’s the TV screen, a spot to stow belongings, a roomy overhead locker and tray table for dining – and, of course, the additional couch-like experience.

On one end of the “settee” there’s a seat equipped with a safety belt to use during take-off and landing. Another safety belt will be installed further down the couch for use in the sleep position.

Testing out the seat

CNN Travel tested out the seat at AIX. It uses the economy-style structure, so there’s not a lot of leg-room in the take-off position.

But the roomy sofa-style space is very inviting. It’s easy to imagine reclining with a book or tucking yourself under a blanket to watch a movie.

It’d also be super sociable if you were traveling with someone else.

As for sleeping, the mock-ups at AIX are the same overall length – 185 centimeters – as Airbus’s traditional business class seat.

Martinez Martin says there’s the potential to make it a bit longer, up to 195 centimeters. They’re going to test drive both lengths.

Because the seat curves, it feels relatively private – but there’s also the option for airlines to add a curtain or screen.

There are other advantages.

“Each passenger has direct access to the aisle, each cabin crew has direct access to the passenger, easily, not like in some of the staggered configurations,” explains Martinez Martin.

Airbus also thinks it’ll be appealing to airlines who fly the same aircraft on both long-haul and short-haul flights:

“It could also be a possibility to certify the two positions for taxi, take-off and landing,” explains Martinez Martin. That means they could use the seat for two people, as well as one person.

Passenger feedback

So what’s the feedback been like at AIX?

“Some of the airlines are crazy about it because, as I said, they are always looking for how to make a better business of their aircraft,” says Martinez Martin.

“If you tell them you are going to carry on less weight, they [work out the] fuel consumption that they can save.”

Meanwhile prospective passengers like the variety the seat offers.

“You feel like being at home in your own lounge,” says Martinez Martin.

Airbus thinks the concept could really take flight.

Big trend

Airbus aren’t the only company exploring mechanism-free, lounge-style business class seating.

French company Safran has also designed a seat that doesn’t use mechanisms. Instead, Safran Essential Business Class uses cushioning in innovative ways.

It’s not quite a sofa, but it’s a similar vibe.

Speaking at AIX, Quentin Munier, strategy and innovation director at Safran, tells CNN Travel that this couch-style trend is the natural next step, after business class seats progressed to full flat designs.

“The sofa principle is something that is interesting to explore,” says Munier.

Munier echoes Martinez Martin’s comments about this kind of seat being more sociable. He also explains that having the ability to move around is important to passengers’ well-being on the flight.

Also on display at AIX is French company Style and Design Group’s innovative approach to business class.

Style and Design’s vice president of design, Romain Chareyre, shows CNN Travel the company’s “Moments” model.

First off, it looks like a swanky armchair, not something you’d expect to see on an airline.

Provocative velvet

Kitted out in on-trend green velvet, with monochrome floral cushioning for the headrest, it’s eye-catching.

It also doesn’t use any complicated mechanisms – it’s got a back rest that folds down and foot rest that folds up, turning into a full bed.

Sitting on the lightweight seat, it’s easy to maneuver into different positions.

Chareyre claims the use of velvet was deliberately provocative. “We want to ask questions,” he says.

It’s worked.

“We have good feedback from airlines, from seat vendors,” says Chareyre. “They like the geometry, the philosophy behind it, the simplicity.”

Passengers, meanwhile, like the idea of space.

“You’re not stuck between units, or constrained,” says Chareyre. “The idea is to be very versatile and open a lot of opportunities for the passenger.”

The Moments chair will also have the so-called “Honeymoon” configuration, where two seats could be positioned next to one another.

So will couch-style seats coexist or replace the traditional business class seat?

Both Safran and Style and Design’s concepts were shortlisted for the Crystal Cabin Awards 2019, so the aviation industry’s clearly taking notice.

“I think it’s replacing it,” says Martinez Martin. “I think it’s more the future of the cabin.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999816417694092}",neutral,0.9999816417694092,0

It flew from Toulouse to northern Greenland and back, in an endurance flight that included a simulated diversion under 180 min ETOPS[1] rules, for which the A320 airliner family is already certified.



The aircraft is due to be delivered to K5 Aviation of Germany in the coming months, after ACJ319neo flight trials are completed.

“We want to fly customers to their destination using the quickest routes, as well as delivering unsurpassed comfort and service, and it’s impressive to see such long-range capability at first hand,” said K5 Aviation CEO and Chief Pilot Erik Scheidt, who participated in the flight.

The ACJ319neo is derived from the A320neo airliner family, which features new engines and wingtip-mounted Sharklets.

“Airbus’ modern aircraft family takes the world in its stride with robust reliability, and corporate jet operators are natural beneficiaries of this airliner heritage, which also brings comparable operating costs to traditional business jets,” said ACJ President Benoit Defforge.

K5 Aviation’s ACJ319neo is fitted with five additional centre tanks (ACTs) in its cargo-hold, and includes improvements such as a lower cabin altitude for greater passenger comfort.

Corporate jet orders and commitments for A320neo Family-derived aircraft now total 14.

Airlines and corporate jet customers have ordered almost 15,000 A320 Family aircraft to date, with more than 700 of the new A320neo version already serving airlines worldwide.

Around 200 Airbus corporate jets are in service worldwide, flying on every continent, including Antarctica.

Four Seasons private Airbus jet to take flight in 2021 - CNN,"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZm91ci1zZWFzb25zLXByaXZhdGUtamV0LWFpcmJ1cy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The Four Seasons Private Jet is getting a very glamorous upgrade.

A fully customized Airbus A321 LR, part of the new Airbus NEO family, is being brought in to replace the current model, the luxury group has announced.

Due to take flight in early 2021, the new aircraft will feature “the widest and tallest cabin in its class” as well as spacious lavatories and an expansive lounge area.

The state-of-the-art plane has room for 48 passengers – with a layout design that ensures guests can socialize easily while in their seats.

Each of the leather handcrafted chairs offers six and a half feet (two meters) of personal space and include an additional ottoman, just in case passengers feel the urge to pull up a seat closer to one of their companions.

“When designing the new Four Seasons Private Jet, we were inspired by the glamor and prestige of air travel in times past, when every flight was a special occasion,” says Dana Kalczak, Vice President of Design at Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.

“With a laser focus on comfort and functionality, our aim is to create an environment that encourages spontaneous social interaction between everyone on board, reinforcing the power of connection.

The new Four Seasons Private Jet also boasts an on-board Four Seasons Executive Chef who’ll prepare meals “inspired by the journey itself,” while interactive workshops hosted by mixology, culinary and wellness experts are to be held in the lounge area.

Renderings of the meticulously designed aircraft, dubbed the “Four Seasons Jet 2.0,” were released this week.

It comes four years after the Toronto-based brand launched its first customized private jet for bespoke group excursions.

Each journey includes air travel and ground transportation, planned excursions, all meals, some drinks and accommodation in Four Seasons properties.

While the current plane, a Boeing 757, has a twin-engine short-to-medium-range jetliner that can fly both long- and short-range routes, Four Seasons apparently opted for the Airbus A321 LR this time round as it accommodated greater customization.

“The Four Seasons Private Jet experience defines modern luxury air travel, encouraging meaningful connections between people and places while delivering a seamless and highly personalized journey,” says Christian Clerc, President of Worldwide Hotel Operations at Four Seasons.

“Building on the tremendous success of our Private Jet program to date, with consistent sell-outs, wait lists, and near-perfect guest satisfaction rates, our drive to continuously innovate and push the conventional limits of travel has led to this new opportunity to experience Four Seasons like never before.”

New itineraries aboard the new Four Seasons Jet are currently in development.

However, deep-pocketed customers can still book trips aboard its current jet, with prices beginning at around $147,000 per person.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0
Airbus Opens Customer Definition Centre for A320 and A330 - APEX Media,"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcmJ1cy1vcGVucy1jdXN0b21lci1kZWZpbml0aW9uLWNlbnRlci1hMzIwLWEzMzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Opens Customer Definition Centre for A320 and A330 Share

Airbus unveiled an extension to its Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg, expanding its offer to A320 and A330 cabins. Airbus invited APEX Media for a tour of the extended facility ahead this week’s Aircraft Interiors Expo.

Going to Hamburg to visit Airbus’ Customer Definition Centre (CDC) – a playground where airlines can see the vision of their dream aircraft cabin come together – used to be a treat for A350 XWB customers only. Now, Airbus has extended the experience to its A320 and A330 customers, with its recently rebranded Airspace Customer Definition Centre, which now encompasses the CDCs for all three aircraft types.

As with the aim of Airspace, which is to develop a common visual language across all of its aircraft interiors, the CDC buildings are connected so airlines with mixed fleets can easily compare what their cabin interiors look like across different programs.

“Four out of five A350 XWB customers are simultaneously A320/A330 operators. This step is a win-win situation for all involved stakeholders to foster and streamline the cabin definition across their fleet,” said SÃ¶ren Scholz, senior vice-president, Cabin and Cargo Program, at Airbus. He also added that other trends such as the increasing number of seating segments (with some airlines having up to five on one aircraft), and some airlines going for a cabin refresh two to three times in an aircraft lifecycle, contributed to the need to extend the facility.

Performance, economics, eco-efficiency and reliability of Airbus’ commercial jets has changed the way airlines operate their aircraft. The A320neo LR, for example, is capable of flying on routes up to eight hours and 4,000 nautical miles. “The passenger and the crew spend more and more time on the aircraft. For us as an aircraft integrator, it’s important that we get to understand market trends as early as possible to anticipate and enable changes in our platform,” said Francois Caudron, Airbus’ senior vice-president and head of Marketing.

New to the A320 and A330 CDC that wasn’t seen before in the A350 XWB CDC is an Airbus-developed system that can project cabin floorplans on a 1:1 scale on the ground that enables airlines to quickly test their seating configurations. There’s also the ability to add physical mock-ups of monuments and banks of seating on top of the projection so the airline can quickly get a sense of the physical space, such as trying to push a trolley within the lines to see if it will make a corner without hitting someone’s knee.

And as with the A350 XWB CDC, the extension for the A320 and A330 programs relies heavily on using virtual reality as a rapid prototyping tool. Airlines can see “real-time” progress on the cabin definition process with every decision made, down to the details of the trims and finishings, in virtual walk-throughs, and physical walk-throughs that require one to strap on a virtual-reality headset. In fact, in one scenario, the ability to quickly produce a digital mockup early on in the process helped Airbus speed up certification tests and sell an additional monument unit, one CDC staffer said.

Thanks to the Airspace CDC, the cabin definition process can be condensed, saving time, cost and money, but the satisfaction of being able to see concepts materialize in virtual reality and physical mock-ups is also a thrill.

But Caudron said airlines ultimately spend a lot of time at the CDC because the aircraft cabin is the place where they make their money. “The airline businesses is about minimizing costs and this is why Airbus is making efficient aircraft, but the responsibility of airlines is also about maximizing revenue and this is place all about optimizing their cabin.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9962416887283325}",neutral,0.9962416887283325,0
Southwest's Airbus visit not related to Boeing 737 MAX crisis - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNC8yOC9zb3V0aHdlc3RzLWFpcmJ1cy12aXNpdC1ub3QtcmVsYXRlZC10by1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC1jcmlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sparking media questioning, Southwest Airlines recently sent some representatives to visit an unknown European Airbus A220 operator to check out some aircraft, however has since explained the trip.

Initially reported by The Air Current, which is run by Jon Ostrower, the news surfaces as airlines are caught in between a rock and a hard place with the Boeing 737 MAX, which remains grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people (JT610 and ET302).

What shocked the industry was the fact that a long-term Boeing 737 customer that’s iconic in the aviation industry for setting up their entire business around the aircraft was reportedly checking out competing aircraft, that, from a passenger and technological standpoint, are far-superior.

Southwest Airlines operates 34 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which, paired with their existing fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, takes their entire fleet up to 754 aircraft.

Since the Federal Aviation Administration followed other worldwide regulators and announced it would also enforce a grounding, Southwest has had to send their 737 MAX aircraft to be temporarily wrapped up and stored.

Southwest Airlines’ Grounded 737 MAX Fleet

Large amounts of flights have been cancelled, adjusted or placed on other aircraft to compensate for the loss of the 737 MAX, which Southwest has planned to be out of service until August.

Reflecting on the headline, Southwest Airlines’ Chief Executive Officer, Gary Kelly, noted the visit was purely coincidental as they had booked the viewing “a long time ago”.

Kelly stresses the airline has no intention to cancel any Boeing 737 MAX orders and he still believes the aircraft is the “best single-aisle airplane in the world”.

Adding to his statement, he mentioned just because the company is an all-Boeing operator, doesn’t mean it will be in the future. Just like all airlines, Southwest Airlines is interested to see what’s available and how it’s performing.

The next step for Southwest and other airlines after reintroducing the 737 MAX is to regain passenger confidence, which the industry is divided about. Will Boeing be able to relight the candle or are they left smoking in the dark?

The Lower Deck Modules Passenger Facility consists in enabling extension of passenger’s space into the cargo hold.

Airbus and Safran have partnered to develop and market lower-deck modules with a variety of flexible passenger solutions in the cargo hold such as beds, stretching-, playground- or business areas. The modules, which would fit inside aircraft cargo compartments, offer new opportunities for additional services to passengers, improving their experience while enabling airlines to differentiate and add value for their commercial operations. The new passenger modules could be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers if required, as aircraft cargo floors and cargo loading systems would not be affected - the passenger module would sit directly on it.

Sören Scholz, Head of Cabin Programme Airbus, said: “We are delighted to have won the Crystal Cabin Award together with Safran for the Lower Deck Modules Passenger Facility. Innovation is our main driver for success and we are continuously striving to offer the latest innovative solutions to airlines and passengers worldwide. I congratulate the team on their great job and well-deserved success.”

“We like to thank the jury of the Crystal Cabin Award for recognizing the opportunities that the Lower Deck Modules will bring to improve the Passenger Experience, and we look forward to further build on our experience in lowerdeck solutions together with Airbus“, said Norman Jordan, CEO of Safran Cabin.

The Crystal Cabin Award is the leading international award for excellence in aircraft interior innovation, sponsored by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. This year, more than 100 concepts, from all over the world, were presented across eight categories.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999490976333618}",positive,0.9999490976333618,1

They have 100 of the ‘new engine option’ planes on order (22 of these deliveries have been deferred). It’s being outfitted in a new ‘dense’ configuration along the lines of the American Airlines 737 MAX, which has the airline’s new standard domestic interior.

In a communication to employees the airline is highlighting five features of the new aircraft.

“[M]ore premium seats than our other A321s, including 20 in first class and 47 in Main Cabin Extra.” Indeed there are more seats overall and they’ve added a fifth row of first class, though both Main Cabin Extra and first class have less space than American’s customers are used to, and in my opinion less comfortable seats. If they had added an additional row of seats to the plane they’d be required to add another flight attendant. That makes me skeptical of American’s claim that “If our customers want the good seats, we have them.”

That makes me skeptical of American’s claim that “If our customers want the good seats, we have them.” Larger “Airbus XL” overhead bins. That means less gate checking of bags, which is good for customers. In fact the airline now flags for gate agents when planes have bigger bins so they don’t demand passengers give up their bags. Bigger bins also means gate checking of bags isn’t delaying departure.

“high-speed Wi-Fi, free live TV, free wireless entertainment, USB power at every seat and A/C power at every seat” but no seat back screens.

“[A]dditional forward oven and galley, with heated floor panels for crew comfort”

“3 extra jump seats for traveling flight attendants.”

Though American is promoting it as crew-friendly the galley actually look cramped to me the way it’s framed, though it’s possible it’s just their photo.

Four more first class seats than existing Airbus A321s, and than on Boeing 737s, is welcome but probably not for crew — it’s more passengers to serve, a heavier workload up front than they’re used to. There won’t be additional crew to be serving more passengers. The neo itself looks like a great aircraft, though.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999387264251709}",neutral,0.9999387264251709,0

A subsidiary of the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), the world’s largest utility company, SGGAC performs aerial construction and maintenance work along China’s network of high and very-high voltage power lines.

The H215 will join the company’s existing fleet of 15 Airbus helicopters, comprised of H125s, an H120 and an H225. This addition will enable SGGAC to perform new missions such as cable repair, cable laying, cargo transportation, and power line pylons constructions in difficult-to-reach areas.

The helicopter comes equipped with a 4.5-ton cargo sling, hoists, weather radar, and a wire-strike protection system. The configuration features 17 comfortable seats equipped with oxygen jackets for high altitude missions.

“Our cooperation with Airbus Helicopters since 2012 has been a true success. Thanks to the H215’s outstanding performance in high and hot conditions coupled with strong support and services from Airbus Helicopters, we are confident that we will continue to develop our capabilities performing new utility missions,” said Wu Jielong, Chairman of SGGAC.

“It’s an honour to see SGGAC becoming the first operator of the H215 in China”, said Marie-Agnes Veve, General Manager of Airbus Helicopters China. “This achievement reinforces the long-term and strategic cooperation we have developed with the company, which also became a certified Airbus Helicopters’ maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) centre in China in 2018.”

The H215 combines advanced avionics and a reliable platform for rugged multi-mission capabilities in the world’s harshest environments. Its baseline configuration offers extremely competitive direct operating and maintenance costs. Standard features include proven Makila 1A1 engines, the latest generation flight management system, and the most modern technologies, which includes a glass cockpit avionics system and the renowned 4-axis autopilot from Airbus Helicopters’ advanced H225.

The introduction of this H215 increases China’s Super Puma fleet to nearly 40 aircraft, performing a wide range of missions from oil & gas to aerial work to VIP transportation. The fleet is supported by Airbus Helicopters’ China technical team, its approved helicopter MRO centre in Shenzhen, and an H225 full flight simulator located in Beijing.

European planemaker Airbus stuck to its full-year financial targets after reporting slightly higher-than-expected core first-quarter profits, overshadowed by a heavy drain on cash as it stocked parts to ease industrial bottlenecks.

Quarterly revenues rose 24 percent from a year ago to 12.55 billion euros ($14 billion), while adjusted operating profit jumped to 549 million euros from 14 million last year, driven by higher commercial jet deliveries.

A Reuters poll had given a mean forecast for revenues of 12.99 billion euros and an adjusted operating profit of 520 million.

Higher deliveries of A320neo jets, which sell at a premium to earlier models, and progress in reducing costs on the larger A350 contributed to the sharp rise in profits. But Airbus still faces snags in producing a longer-range A321 with new cabins.

""Airbus is working to improve execution in its internal industrial systems and monitoring engine performance,"" it said in a statement. Engine delays have also weighed on deliveries.

Excluding adjustments, earnings fell 9 percent partly as a result of a row over Germany's suspension of export licences to Saudi Arabia and costs for the A380 superjumbo, which Airbus has said it plans to shut down in 2021 due to poor sales.

Airbus suffered a cash outflow of 4.3 billion euros in the quarter as it built inventories but the company is expected to see that reverse course later in the year.

It reaffirmed 2019 targets including positive free cashflow of 4 billion euros and a 15 percent rise in operating profit.

Last week, Airbus' rival Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said that lowered production due to the grounding of its 737 MAX jet after two crashes had cost it at least $1 billion so far.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6149726510047913}",negative,0.6149726510047913,-1
Delta A220 First Class Review I - One Mile at a Time,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2RlbHRhLWEyMjAtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta recently became the first US airline to take delivery of the Airbus A220 (the next North American airline to receive the aircraft will be Air Canada, in early 2020). This plane was formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries, but ended up being rebranded as the A220 thanks to a joint venture between Bombardier and Airbus.

The A220 represents an interesting direction for Delta, as these planes will largely be used to replace their MD-80 aircraft, which are quite old. Historically Delta is an airline that keeps planes for a really long time but maintains them well, while here Delta is actually buying new planes.

Walking onto a Delta plane with a new plane smell is sorta surreal!

Anyway, in this post I wanted to share my thoughts about my two hour flight on Delta’s A220 first class from Dallas to Detroit.

The A220 cabin is beautiful

The A220 is known for being a comfortable little plane, and Delta did a fantastic job with their cabin finishes.

There are 12 first class seats, so the ratio of first class to economy seats is pretty good.

Economy is in a 2-3 configuration, so it’s great that there’s only one middle seat per row.

There are personal televisions, power ports, and high speed Wi-Fi at every seat.

I find it hilarious that American thinks people don’t enjoy watching TV on planes, but rather are happy bringing their own entertainment. How many people in the below picture do you see not enjoying the seat back entertainment?

The overhead bins on this plane are definitely bigger than on the MD-80, though still not as big as on most mainline planes.

The bathrooms are spacious

Nowadays I feel like airlines are competing with one another to see how tight they can make bathrooms on planes. In that sense the A220 is a breath of fresh air, as the bathrooms are among the biggest I’ve seen on a narrow body plane.

One of the bathrooms in the back even has a window.

The first class cabin is on the tight side

This doesn’t come as much of a surprise, but the cabin isn’t quite as wide as your typical A320 or 737. As a result, first class seats are on the tight side compared to flying a 737 or A320.

For example, the armrest between first class seats is quite narrow.

This isn’t a big deal at all, but it’s definitely less comfortable than your typical 737 or A320 first class. That’s fair enough, and not a big deal, but is something worth being aware of.

CSeries vs. A220

It’s interesting to me that even though the plane was rebranded as the A220 last year, the inflight entertainment and inflight announcements still refer to the CSeries. Did Delta not get the memo?

The Delta crew had no clue what they were doing

It was the crew’s first time flying the A220, and they were hilariously unfamiliar with the plane. They couldn’t get the PA to work at first. Then they couldn’t get the safety video to work, so they did a manual safety demonstration.

And they were just generally so hilarious about it. The manual safety demonstration started with “believe it or not, there’s over 60 years of seniority in this cabin.”

“This plane is equipped with eight emergency exits. We have two exits at the front, four… wait, no, two window exits, and two exits in the back. That brings our exits down to six.”

How many pilots does it take to close a door?

At departure time the gate agent tried to close the door, and it didn’t latch. Uh oh. She tried again. And again. And again. The same problem persisted.

Then there was a pilot in the jumpseat who tried to help with closing the door from the inside. He couldn’t get it to shut either. Then the captain of the flight tried to shut it. He probably tried it a dozen times before the door finally closed, and in the process some mechanism in the door definitely came loose.

We made it to Detroit safely, so I guess it wasn’t a safety issue at least!

Delta crews (and other small touches) make a big difference

It’s not like the difference between flying American and Delta is that huge, though there are a lot of small touches that add up.

For example, Delta has a bottle of water at your seat upon boarding, and also has a pillow and blanket, while American only offers a blanket.

Similarly, their crews just really care, and it shows. They actually seem like they enjoy being there, and that makes a big difference.

Bottom line

It’s great to see Delta adding A220s to their fleet. These are an improvement over their MD-80 planes. It’s also great to see that these planes feature big bathrooms, personal televisions at every seat, and a reasonably sized first class cabin.

In economy some may even prefer this plane to other mainline planes, given the 2-3 layout, while in first class the seats are noticeably tighter.

The icing on the cake was that it was the crew’s first flight on the plane, and the good humor with which they approached the flight.

If you’ve flown the Delta A220, what was your experience like?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999024868011475}",neutral,0.9999024868011475,0
A critical fight: anti-poaching with the H125 - Airbus,"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA0LWEtY3JpdGljYWwtZmlnaHQtYW50aS1wb2FjaGluZy13aXRoLXRoZS1oMTI10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud; Photos: Airbus Helicopters/Anthony Pecchi. Article adapted from Rotor magazine #115.

The statistics are dire. Less than 4,000 tigers are left in the wild. The western black rhino and northern white rhino are now extinct outside of protected reserves (1). These animals, and hundreds of other species, are victims of poaching – killed for their pelts, horns, tusks, shells, etc. – and sold around the world as trophies, medicine, clothing, jewelry, and exotic meat. Poaching is second only to habitat destruction as a threat to the future of the world’s endangered animal populations, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The “bad guys” are poachers, to be sure, aided by sophisticated trafficking networks. But the guilty also include consumers.

We often fly areas that we usually don’t see from the ground, and we can see when there is a problem happening in that area. The helicopter helps in alerting our team to that problem.

- Carl-Heinz Moeller, chief pilot for the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism

“One advantage of the aircraft is [that] constant aerial surveillance of the area does deter people from the outside from getting in,” says Moeller, who often overflies Etosha National Park.

Stepping up the effort

Heroic efforts are taking place to combat wildlife crime, from educational campaigns like the one in international airports, to Namibia’s increase in resources earmarked for on-the-ground anti-poaching.

And in-the-air. At least two countries have added the H125 helicopter to their arsenal in the anti-poaching fight. The Botswana Police Service employs one of four H125s for anti-poaching missions, in addition to their regular law enforcement duties. And Namibia’s Ministry of Environment and Tourism employs an H125 to perform game capture, aerial surveys and game counts, and for general park management.

“Our aircraft falls under wildlife support services,” says Carl-Heinz Moeller, chief pilot for the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism. “We often fly areas that we usually don’t see from the ground, and we can see when there is a problem happening in that area. The helicopter helps in alerting our team to that problem.”

An aerial deterrent

“One advantage of the aircraft is [that] constant aerial surveillance of the area does deter people from the outside from getting in,” says Moeller, who often overflies Etosha National Park. “And it helps the ground staff when they go out, as an aerial support; it gives them a bit of confidence.”

To monitor whether poaching is on the rise, the ministry does game counts. “We fly transects which are worked out beforehand. They will be about 500 metres apart through the whole length of the area that needs to be counted,” says Moeller. “We count everything on either side of the aircraft at a certain height, usually about 150 feet, depending on the terrain.”

One of the four H125s flying over the reserve, east from Botswana’s capital Gaborone.

The H125 is well-suited to the high and hot environment in Africa. “When you talk about the performance of this aircraft in relation to the climate and conditions in Botswana, we are sitting roughly between 3,200 and in some places 5,000 feet, and the temperatures are a little bit high,” says E.S. Morris, Assistant Commissioner with the Botswana Police Service, and chief pilot of the air support branch. “The H125s have performed well in this situation. There is nowhere in the country where I would say the aircraft wouldn’t perform.”

“I wouldn’t want to fly any other machine for these types of missions,” Moeller adds.

China's first Airbus H215 delivered to SGGAC for utility missions - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2NoaW5hcy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtaDIxNS1kZWxpdmVyZWQtdG8tc2dnYWMtZm9yLXV0aWxpdHktbWlzc2lvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s State Grid General Aviation Company (SGGAC) has taken delivery of one heavy twin-engine Airbus H215 helicopter – a member of the mission-proven Super Puma family — becoming the launch customer for the H215 in China.

A subsidiary of the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), the world’s largest utility company, SGGAC performs aerial construction and maintenance work along China’s network of high and very-high voltage power lines.

The H215 will join the company’s existing fleet of 15 Airbus helicopters, comprised of H125s, an H120 and an H225. This addition will enable SGGAC to perform new missions such as cable repair, cable laying, cargo transportation, and power line pylons constructions in difficult-to-reach areas.

The helicopter comes equipped with a 4.5-ton cargo sling, hoists, weather radar, and a wire-strike protection system. The configuration features 17 comfortable seats equipped with oxygen jackets for high altitude missions.

“Our cooperation with Airbus Helicopters since 2012 has been a true success. Thanks to the H215’s outstanding performance in high and hot conditions coupled with strong support and services from Airbus Helicopters, we are confident that we will continue to develop our capabilities performing new utility missions,” said Wu Jielong, chairman of SGGAC.

“It’s an honor to see SGGAC becoming the first operator of the H215 in China,” said Marie-Agnes Veve, general manager of Airbus Helicopters China. “This achievement reinforces the long-term and strategic cooperation we have developed with the company, which also became a certified Airbus Helicopters’ maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) center in China in 2018.”

The H215 combines advanced avionics and a reliable platform for rugged multi-mission capabilities in the world’s harshest environments. Its baseline configuration offers extremely competitive direct operating and maintenance costs. Standard features include proven Makila 1A1 engines, the latest generation flight management system, and the most modern technologies, which includes a glass cockpit avionics system and the renowned four-axis autopilot from Airbus Helicopters’ advanced H225.

The introduction of this H215 increases China’s Super Puma fleet to nearly 40 aircraft, performing a wide range of missions from oil-and-gas to aerial work to VIP transportation. The fleet is supported by Airbus Helicopters’ China technical team, its approved helicopter MRO center in Shenzhen, and an H225 full-flight simulator located in Beijing.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9852063059806824}",positive,0.9852063059806824,1
"Airbus expands Airspace Customer Definition Centre to A330, A320neo lines - PaxEx.Aero","Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtYWlyc3BhY2UtY3VzdG9tZXItZGVmaW5pdGlvbi1jZW50cmUtdG8tYTMzMC1hMzIwbmVvLWV4cGFuc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2014 Airbus opened the A350 Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg to help its customers better plan interiors for their new aircraft. With the expansion of the Airspace common design elements to the A330neo and A320neo lines the space needed to expand to further those opportunities. This week the company officially inaugurated the expanded and renamed Airspace Customer Definition Centre (ACDC), adding more than 4,500 square meters to the facility and more than doubling the number of airlines that can be accommodated for design sessions.

Virtual reality and augmented reality play a significant role in the Airspace Customer Definition Center’s ability to deliver aircraft interior designs quickly and reliably for airlines

With the ability of the A320-Family aircraft to serve long-range routes and the A330neo evolution, the cabins of these aircraft families have become more specific and are subject to intense customization. Since today four out of five A350 XWB customers are simultaneously A320/A330 operators this step is a win-win-situation for all involved stakeholders to foster and streamline the cabin definition across their fleet. – Sören Scholz, Airbus Senior Vice President Cabin & Cargo Programme

The value of the facility comes on multiple fronts. One element is the ability to quickly and easily bring all the relevant parties together in Hamburg for the necessary meetings. Sören Scholz, SVP Cabin & Cargo Programs for Airbus, described the facility location as “where the center of gravity for the engineering around the cabins sits. This is the place where you find the maximum competencies,” including Airbus resources and external partners.

To that end, the company does not expect to see additional ACDC facilities elsewhere in the world. But it does anticipate growing the aircraft included. Sören noted that Airbus “should not differentiate away from the A220” in that context, though a specific timeline for including it in the Airspace design language is unclear.

Going Digital at the Airbus Airspace Customer Definition Centre

Beyond having the right people all together the ACDC brings significant technology into play. It is a digital-first operation, with heavy reliance on technology to help speed decision making and validate plans before systems are ordered and installation begins. Stefan Römelt, SVP Engineering and Head of the Cabin & Cargo Center of Competence for Airbus, explains that the “application of digital means we are pushing forward not only design but also manufacturing and assembly.” Being faster to market and more responsive to airline customer needs is a big deal when competing for aircraft deals.

Some of that technology manifests in the heavy use of virtual reality and augmented systems at the ACDC. A single user can don a headset to “walk around” in a cabin and get a feel for the position of monuments or the different fabric color options. A group can take advantage of facilities like the Projection Room where a cabin layout is cast onto the floor. Arrangements can be quickly and easily modified to sample layouts. Galley carts can roll through the virtual aisle, helping airlines understand what works and what does not.

Römelt further noted the value in quickly getting to a feasible cabin design, with minor tweaks with each revision, “Instead of doing things only in sequence we can run in parallel. We discover issues earlier in the design process.”

The digital rendering translates to what the company calls a digital mock-up (DMU) process. With the Airspace Customer Definition Centre in play an “early” version of that process (eDMU) now accelerates the involvement of Airbus engineering resources by roughly six months. That means more time to discover potential design conflicts. It brings a half year of additional time to consider aircraft certification challenges and how to meet them with small adjustments to the design. Airlines can simulate the certification process in a 3D rendering to identify red flags that must be fixed before the design is locked and hardware is ordered for final assembly. Airbus executives and engineers cited multiple examples of successes with this work in the first few years the program has been available to airlines, saving time and costly rework.

The ultimate goals for Airbus are twofold. The company wants to easy the process of delivering cabins with a similar design feel across the product line. And it wants to cut the time to produce that experience, as well as the costs. It is not alone on that front, of course. But with the Airspace unified design language running across types and consolidation of the airline customer experience process into a single, highly digital space, it is making huge strides to lead on this front.

Airbus Helicopters awarded Australia's ARH Tiger support contract extension - Airbus,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wNC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYXdhcmRlZC1hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWFyaC10aWdlci1zdXBwb3J0LWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brisbane, Airbus has been awarded an extension of the Australian Army’s Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) Tiger through-life support (TLS) contract by the Australian Department of Defence.

Airbus Australia Pacific Managing Director Andrew Mathewson said that the five-year, TLS contract extension reflected the current standing of the Tiger in Australia.

“Airbus is committed to ensuring the success of the Australian ARH Tiger fleet, and we have worked closely with the Australian Army and our industry partners to improve the fleet‘s performance over many years,” he said.

The TLS extension covering the ARH programme until 2025 includes:

• More extensive aircraft and component deeper maintenance;

• Operational maintenance of aircraft allocated to training;

• Aircrew and technician training including maintenance of training devices;

• Design services including OEM design incorporation;

• Systems and software development and testing;

• Complete parts support including MRO, purchasing, storage and distribution;

• Technical publications; maintenance policy; and fleet management.

“I’m proud that more than 200 full time positions will remain in Australia to carry out this very important work supporting the Army Aviation Australia-wide, including the creation of apprenticeships in Darwin,” he added. “Moreover, our Airbus engineering capabilities continue to expand thanks to this contract, with key software and modifications being developed on Australian soil.”

Mr Mathewson also said that there would be a cycle of continuous improvement as Airbus continues to learn from the extensive operational experience gained by Tiger helicopters in other countries.

“This is an aircraft type that will serve on into the 2040s in the worldwide fleet. “We will endeavour to provide the best armed reconnaissance helicopter capability in Australia over the same timeframe,” he said.

The two-seater ARH Tiger attack helicopter serves as a key asset for the Australian Army. Today, the fleet of 22 ARH Tiger has flown over 30,000 hours, deployed for day-and-night surveillance and fire-support missions. Globally, 181 Tigers have been delivered to Australia, France, Germany and Spain, and have accumulated over 115,000 flight hours to date. First deployed by the French Army in Afghanistan in 2009, the Tiger continues to demonstrate its essential role on theatres of operation as a highly versatile, stealthy, and maneuverable attack helicopter.

Airbus enters a new era as Faury takes the helm - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbnRlcnMtbmV3LWVyYS1mYXVyeS10YWtlcy1oZWxtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Guillaume Faury’s first year at the helm of Airbus will include a couple of welcome milestones as well as well-documented ongoing problems at the European aerospace giant.

The manufacturer’s A350 program expects to break even in 2019 and its successful A320 family aims to reach a production rate of 60 aircraft a month by the middle of the year.

On the downside, there are ongoing investigations into illicit payments made by Airbus agents, problems with the A400M military transport that produced a 400m euro charge in 2018 and the winding down of the A380 program after Emirates reduced its order from 162 to 123 aircraft.

READ: Airbus to upgrade alerting software after Downunder incident.

Airbus now expects to deliver eight A380 superjumbos in 2019, seven in 2020 and the last two in 2021 as it winds down the program.

But Faury inherits from former chief executive Tom Enders a company in good financial shape and with fewer of the internal ructions that hampered it in the past.

This will enable Airbus to pay a gross dividend to shareholders of €1.65 per share, up 10 percent on the previous year.

It has also seen it for the first time achieve a 9 percent return on sales with the figure for commercial aircraft above 10 percent.

The new chief executive was endorsed at the Airbus annual meeting in Amsterdam on Wednesday, marking a generation change in leadership.

Giving the company’s outlook at Wednesday’s annual meeting, Faury said Airbus expected the world economy and air traffic to grow in line with prevailing independent forecasts assuming no major disruptions.

He said the company was targeting 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2019 and this would result in an increase in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of about 15 percent compared to 2018.

He noted 2018 was a year of solid performance in all of the company’s businesses “with guidance achieved or exceeded”.

“The results confirm that we deliver on our commitments and we intend to do so again this year,’’ he said.

“Our commercial aircraft backlog…supports our single-aisle ramp-up plans and a steady rate 10 on the A350.

“We’re on track for the A320 rate 60 by the middle of this year and we are preparing for higher rates in 2021.

“We will reach the break-even on the A350 in ’19 and we will further improve the A350 margins beyond.”

He said Airbus had “re-baselined” the troubled A400M program and expected to deliver in line with its commitments.

He said the company was well positioned to leverage its military business and would continue to focus on program execution, continuous improvement and competitiveness.

It would continue to invest in its industrial system and digital innovations.

“We want to improve the way we design, manufacture and service our aircraft systems and our products for customers,’’ he said.

Enders had earlier told the meeting that Airbus had “significantly de-risked” the A400M program with an upcoming contract amendment and an improvement in operations and capability. The program cost the company 400m euros in charges in 2018.

He also revealed it had significantly reduced the value of its backlog under new accounting standards that to 460 billion euros to reflect “recoverability” and the net transaction price on the airframe and engine.

“The significant reduction in backlog value is mainly due to the net versus list prices,’’ he said. “So we had list prices before and we have net prices now”.

However, there was no change in the number of aircraft in the backlog and this had reached a new industry record of 7577 aircraft at the end of 2018, including almost 500 A220s.

Enders said Airbus had seen “good commercial momentum” on the 220, particularly after the deal was finalized with Bombardier and the Government of Quebec in July.

He said the A220 delivery target for 2019 was 45 aircraft.

The A320 backlog was still more than 6000 aircraft and supported the plan to reach a production rate of 60 aircraft a month by the middle of 2019 and 63 in 2021.

The outgoing CEO said Airbus could go higher but needed to take the whole supply chain with it and had reached the point where it realized “at this point, we should not overdo it”.

He noted that more than 60 percent of A320s delivered in 2018 were neos and said this was one reason profitability soared in 2018.

Airbus was planning to deliver about 50 A330 family deliveries in 2019 with a few open slots from 2020 onwards.

The A350 reached rate 10 in the fourth quarter, as predicted five years ago, and the backlog supported continuing this rate in the future, Enders said.

Faury. who headed Airbus’s commercial aircraft business before becoming CEO, has a long connection with the European manufacturer

He began his career in 1992 as a flight-test engineer for the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter in the French government agency Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA).

He joined Airbus-owned Eurocopter in 1998 and worked in engineering, programs and flight testing before becoming executive vice president for programs and ending up as head of research and development.

In 2009, he became the head of R&D at automotive company PSA before returning to Airbus Helicopters in 2013 as chief executive.

Chairman Denis Ranque predicted Faury would successfully guide Airbus into the next decade.

“Guillaume has exactly the right skill set and experience needed to take Airbus forward,” he said.

The board also announced it had selected Rene Obermann to succeed Ranque as chairman when his term expires at the close of the 2020 AGM.

Obermann has been an independent non-executive board member since April 2018.

A former chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, Obermann has been managing director of private equity house Warburg Pincus since 2015 and is also a board member with Telenor ASA and Allianz Deutschland AG.

“After a thorough review, the Board has selected a very capable successor to take over when I step down as Chairman next year,” Ranque said.

“Through his current role as a Board Member, René Obermann already knows Airbus well, while his entrepreneurial background and executive experience leading senior management teams bring the right competences and mindset.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9268427491188049}",positive,0.9268427491188049,1
Airbus & Facebook’s High Altitude Drone Crashes in Australian Outback - Drone Below,"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmViZWxvdy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNC8xMi9haXJidXMtZmFjZWJvb2tzLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtZHJvbmUtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbi1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW91dGJhY2sv0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9kcm9uZWJlbG93LmNvbS8yMDE5LzA0LzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1mYWNlYm9va3MtaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS1kcm9uZS1jcmFzaGVzLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tb3V0YmFjay8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"0 ( 0 )

The West Australian on Wednesday 10 April 2019 carried reports that Facebook’s drone trial at Kimberley had met with an unexpected setback when it crashed during testing . The drone was part of an initiative dedicated to helping the social media giant become a global internet service provider, and was supposed to demonstrate Facebook’s High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) communications capabilities as a way to deliver internet services to remote communities. This setback comes ahead of a meeting in Egypt scheduled for later this year, where major companies will be vying for control of the wireless spectrum, as 5G mobile networking rolls out.

It was in the middle of 2018 that the aerospace giant Airbus had chosen a remote outback airport in Western Australia as the first location from which to operate its Zephyr HAPS unmanned aerial system.

The solar cell powered Zephyr HAPS is made of lightweight composites can fly above commercial airspace at 65,000 feet (20km) for months at a time and had made a world record for uninterrupted solar flight. The aim was to provide a range of earth observation services and communications connectivity for people in remote areas, including for civil, military or humanitarian purposes.

Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan had said, “Our local economy will benefit from this decision, with up to 20 Airbus staff also earmarked to be based in the local area during operational phases,” adding, “the choice of Wyndham due to the largely unrestricted airspace and reliable weather, together with the strong support provided by the Western Australian Government, provides both a job creation opportunity in the east Kimberley and a technology advancement opportunity for Western Australia, and Australia, more generally.”

Falling in the military-grade surveillance category the Airbus Zephyr drone is understood to be 25m wide and has the capacity to fly in the stratosphere for weeks. The craft was expected to start a secretive, one-month flight mission on April 1, but reportedly crashed at take-off.

Spokespeople for Facebook, Airbus and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau were approached for comment by The Australian but remained unavailable for comment about the crash.

Facebook is facing ire already for the blame that it aided in the spread of hate speech and disseminating propaganda overseas. So its intent to connect the “next billion” internet users is under fire though the social media platform seems to be coping with the backlash.

Airbus A319neo performs maiden flight - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNC8yNi9haXJidXMtYTMxOW5lby1wZXJmb3Jtcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The final variant in the original lineup of re-engined A320 aircraft, the A319neo powered by Pratt and Whitney engines, has performed its maiden flight.

Airbus recently received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency for the A319neo, however it was for the CFM LEAP engine variant.

Airbus A319neo CFM LEAP Engines

With two engine options available for each A320neo Family aircraft, Airbus has to conduct two test campaigns per aircraft. Despite this, commonality has sided well with the company, allowing them to conduct a shortened test campaign for the second engine option as it’s primarily fuel systems, performance and and instrumentation that is monitored.

Registered D-AVWA, the aircraft took off from Airbus’ Hamburg facility on the 25th of April for a 2 hour and 45 minute flight under callsign “AIB04WA”.

Airbus aims to have the aircraft certified by the fourth quarter of this year, with a short, but extensive flight test campaign. This particular aircraft was the same used to certify the CFM option, however has had the appropriate software and hardware conversion to test with Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan engines.

The following table displays some of the key specifications of the aircraft:

Range 6,850km (3,700nm) Typical Seating 140 (2-class) Max Takeoff Weight 75.50 tonnes

As a quick note, the aircraft is the final variant of the original A320neo Family lineup, being the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo, before the A321LR and other sub-options were announced.

Airbus A321LR (Long Range) with Cabin Flex



It’s understood Airbus has begun penciling in orders for a longer range variant dubbed the A321XLR, which like the previous aircraft, will likely have two engine options as well as its rumored weight and fuel modifications.

The A319neo is the smallest member of the A320neo Family, which alone, has raked in over 6500 orders from over 100 customers since its launch in 2010.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998593330383301}",neutral,0.9998593330383301,0

The aircraft are replacing two of the ICG’s three existing Airbus AS332L1 Super Pumas, the first of which entered service in 1995. They are being leased from Norwegian helicopter lessor Knut Axel Ugland Holding AS and will both be in service by the end of April 2019. The ICG plans to purchase permanent replacements for all three aircraft in its fleet by 2022.

Airbus Helicopters is providing pilot and technician training on key features of the H225 and ongoing maintenance and support under an HCare Smart Parts By the Hour contract.

The 11-tonne category, twin-engine H225 is the latest member of Airbus Helicopters’ Super Puma family with more powerful engines providing a smoother ride and enhanced performance compared to the AS332L1.

Equipped with state-of-the-art electronic instruments and a 4-axis autopilot system, the H225 offers outstanding endurance and fast cruise speed, and can be fitted with a wide range of SAR equipment. Operated by two pilots, it can be configured with up to 18 seats or six stretchers.

The H225 and military H225M are benchmarks in SAR and combat SAR and are operated by 20 nations worldwide.

Commander S.G. Sindri Steingrimsson, Director Flight Operations at the ICG said: “The experience with our current fleet of Super Pumas has been excellent through the years. Overall they have done a fantastic job for us here at the Icelandic Coast Guard, in some of the most challenging conditions for aircraft SAR operations in the world. We fully expect that the new Super Pumas will add great value to the safety and security of our operations, increasing capability and reliability while at the same time modernising our technological standards to meet current needs.”

German government to buy three new Airbus A350 for €1.2 billion - AeroTime,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjI1NTItZ2VybWFuLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYnV5cy10aHJlZS1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZm9yLTEtMi1iaWxsaW9u0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMjU1Mi1nZXJtYW4tZ292ZXJubWVudC1idXlzLXRocmVlLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1mb3ItMS0yLWJpbGxpb24vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Budget Committee of the German Bundestag approved the acquisition of three new Airbus A350s on April 11, 2019, to renew the governmental fleet. They should be delivered by 2023.

The total cost is estimated to be around €1.2 billion, making it one of the most expensive governmental fleet on the planet.

The three A350-900s should be acquired from Airbus for €640 million. Refurbishing the cabin to a VIP standard should cost €288 million, while specific defense systems will add another €229 million to the bill. The latter should include the integration of a Large Aircraft Infrared Counter-Measure system (LAIRCM) to protect the planes from incoming missiles. The order will be placed by April 15, 2019, according to the Ministry of Defense.

A transition from two to three aircraft should increase the readiness of the fleet. Due to maintenance work, the government often had to rely on only one of the two A340s. Moreover, the Ministry argues that the “aircraft of the type A350 are [only] produced since 2015, which provides a long availability of spare parts”.

Discussions to acquire new aircraft for the German government attracted the spotlight in November 2018, when Chancellor Angela Merkel was forced to give up on attending the opening of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. The official plane that was supposed to take her to Argentina, the A340 VIP “Konrad Adenauer”, was forced to an emergency landing in Cologne after an electronic distribution box caused several systems, including the communications, to shut down. The chancellor eventually took a commercial flight from Madrid to Argentina.

More recently, on March 1, 2019, the head of German diplomacy, Heiko Maas, was stuck in Mali due to a failure of an Airbus A319, also part of the governmental fleet.

The two Luftwaffe A340s that currently compose the backbone of the German governmental fleet were acquired second-hand in 2011 from Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) , and refitted to governmental standards (secured communication systems, anti-missile systems…) for a total of about €740 million. The German minister of Defense announced its decision to replace them with new governmental aircraft in February 2019.

As the aircraft will not be used solely by the German Armed Forces and the Federal Ministry of Defense but will be available for the transport of all government members, the purchase will be financed using the federal budget. “Of course, the transportation of government members on important dates should not be at the expense of the air force, which needs its budget for helicopters and planes in operation,” said Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen when the procurement was announced.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999309778213501}",neutral,0.9999309778213501,0

Airbus to upgrade A320 alerting software after downunder incident - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy11cGdyYWRlLWEzMjAtYWx0ZXJ0aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlLWRvd251bmRlci1pbmNpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is now updating software on its A320 aircraft to ensure pilots receive alerts at an appropriate level of priority during periods of multiple alerts and high workload after a serious incident at Perth in 2015.

The move by Airbus comes as Boeing works with regulators to have a grounding lifted on its 737 MAX aircraft over problems related to unreliable data triggering software corrections.

According to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the Airbus update follows its investigation into an unreliable airspeed indication and stall warning involving a Virgin Australia Regional Airlines Airbus A320 near Perth Airport on September 12, 2015.

SEE our 737 MAX coverage

The ATSB said that “while passing through 8,500 ft, (and over Dalkeith) the aircraft’s auto-thrust and autopilot disconnected and multiple system alerts were generated. The captain took manual control of the aircraft and continued the climb to 20,000 ft, and leveled off to troubleshoot the issues and plan a return to Perth.”

It found that “the auto-thrust and autopilot disconnect was the result of erroneous airspeed indications during the take-off and climb due to blocked pitot tubes (sensors). The erroneous airspeeds were not detected by the pilots but had been detected by the aircraft’s systems, which had triggered the disconnect and generated multiple alerts including a ‘NAV ADR DISAGREE’ alert.”

The ATSB said that “this alert requires the pilots to cross-check the three airspeed indications and assists them in determining if the source of the alert is an airspeed or angle of attack disagreement.

Critically, however, limited space in the alert message area of the display meant the urgent warning was initially pushed off the screen for engine-related alerts programmed with a higher priority but in this case not requiring immediate action by the crew.

As a result of the crew’s high workload ,the procedures for these alerts initially were not actioned and they were unable to address the ‘NAV ADR DISAGREE’ alert for about eight minutes, by which time the airspeed discrepancies had corrected themselves.

The ATSB found this sequencing of alert priorities and the alerts associated procedure may have led the pilots to incorrectly identify the source of the alert as an angle of attack discrepancy.

Then when returning to Perth, while aligning with the instrument landing system, the stall warning activated but stopped after six seconds and the approach was continued for a successful landing.

Combined with the multiple system alerts, which to the flight crew appeared to be unrelated, the flight crew thought the stall warning that activated during the approach was spurious and as such did not apply the stall recovery procedure.

ATSB Executive Director, Transport Safety, Mr Nat Nagy, said modern aircraft with multiple interacting systems can have many layers between the source information and the pilots.

“The ATSB’s safety message from this investigation is where there is erroneous information from an information source, it is important that alerts and procedures be designed to ensure that the pilots can correctly diagnose the source of the erroneous information,” Mr Nagy said.

“Further, unless it is absolutely clear that it is erroneous, pilots should appropriately respond to stall warning alerts.”

Airbus is in the process of updating the A320’s software so that the NAV ADR DISAGREE alert has a higher priority than the associated engine alerts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9798786640167236}",neutral,0.9798786640167236,0

Airbus Helicopters, the largest global helicopter manufacturer, said it strongly believes in the growth potential of the helicopter market in China, as it put into operation its first H135 helicopter final assembly line outside of Europe in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Wednesday.

The plant serves as the first helicopter final assembly line built by a foreign manufacturer in China. The first helicopter assembled in Qingdao is expected to roll off the production line in the latter half of the year.

Airbus Helicopters, a subdivision of European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE, holds a 51 percent stake, and United General Aviation Co holds a 49 percent stake, according to the manufacturer.

H135, a light twin-engine helicopter, mainly operates in the sectors of emergency medical services, search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting and tourism. Production will start with an annual capacity of 18 helicopters, and it could be doubled in the next few years to accommodate growing demand, Airbus Helicopters said.

Prompted by the rapid growth of emergency medical services, public services and offshore wind industries over the next 20 years, potential demand for 600 light twin-engine helicopters is expected in China, the company predicted.

""The China market is very important for us and it is going to boom very quickly. We strongly believe in this market. Manufacturing H135s in Qingdao marks the start of a new chapter in Sino-European collaboration,"" said Marie-Agnes Veve, general manager of Airbus Helicopters China.

""This achievement is a testament to our continued commitment to the Chinese helicopter industry and the strong spirit of cooperation that exists between us and our Chinese partners,"" she said.

She added that a part of open space at the plant has been reserved for potential suppliers, and the plant may develop into an industrial park in the future to meet significantly growing demand.

The opening of the final assembly line follows a cooperation agreement signed between Airbus Helicopters and Chinese buyers in 2016 for the purchase of 100 H135s for the China market. Five of these 100 helicopters will be assembled in Germany and 95 of them will be assembled in Qingdao.

Components such as the main fuselage, main gearbox kits and the rear fuselage will be shipped to Qingdao from Germany and Spain. The Qingdao plant is composed of four work stations, a paint booth, ground and flight test areas, and a delivery center. The site will employ around 40 people.

Currently, Airbus Helicopters accounts for 37 percent of the civil helicopter market in China, followed by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. Other major players in the sector include Leonardo SpA, Russian Helicopters JSC and Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.

Despite the domestic helicopter sector still being in its infancy and the market scale being much smaller than in Europe and the United States, it has quickly caught up in recent years. The Chinese mainland now stands as the second-largest helicopter market in the Asia-Pacific region, right after Australia. Last year, the Chinese mainland added 82 new helicopters, which is the largest annual increment recorded in the Asia-Pacific region.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9860019683837891}",positive,0.9860019683837891,1
