Enables pilots to “see through” poor visibility conditions for more efficient, sustainable operations

CEDAR RAPIDS (Aug. 10, 2021) – Collins Aerospace’s next-generation Enhanced Vision Sensor has been selected to be integrated into Airbus’ Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS). EFVS will become a selectable option on Airbus commercial aircraft, expanding approach capability and increasing flight situational awareness during reduced visibility conditions. The EFVS option, with the Collins EVS sensor, will be offered first on the A320 aircraft, with the intention to offer this solution on other platforms in the future.

The EFVS will use input from the Collins Aerospace sensor, mounted on the nose of the aircraft, to create an augmented reality view of the outside world. The sensor uses multiple infrared and visible light cameras to “see through” poor visibility conditions better than the human eye. When the pilots view this camera video on head-up displays, it allows them to better identify the runway environment in all weather conditions — helping pilots overcome many flight disruptions often created by fog or precipitation. In addition, because the technology enables pilots to reduce delays on the runway and in the air, it actively reduces the amount of carbon emissions created by the aircraft.

“Thanks to new EFVS regulations, we’re able to leverage this technology for airlines across the globe that want to optimize their operations,” said Dave Nieuwsma, president of Avionics for Collins Aerospace. “Airbus operators who adopt EFVS will enjoy a competitive advantage that directly translates into improved on-time performance, operational cost and fuel savings.”

In addition, EFVS will also ease instrument to visual transition and provide enhanced situational awareness, in particular for “night Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)” conditions, and/or terrain, as well as lateral alignment on the runway, traffic and runway surface identification.

The next-generation EVS sensor will also be available for retrofit on existing in-service Airbus aircraft.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990872144699097}",positive,0.9990872144699097,1
Could Boeing and Airbus have their wings clipped by China’s C919 jet? - South China Morning Post,"Sun, 08 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ0MDk1L2FpcmJ1cy1lZGdlLW92ZXItYm9laW5nLWNoaW5hLXVuZGVyLXRocmVhdC1jb21hY3MtbmV3LWM5MTnSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2dsb2JhbC1lY29ub215L2FydGljbGUvMzE0NDA5NS9haXJidXMtZWRnZS1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1jaGluYS11bmRlci10aHJlYXQtY29tYWNzLW5ldy1jOTE5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China has spent tens of billions of dollars to bring its aviation industry up to international standards in recent years, and has high hopes in particular for its C919, a narrow body medium-haul passenger jet designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. It is expected to be certified to fly in China by the end of this year.

Both Airbus and Boeing assemble jets in China for the domestic market, savvy political moves to help them each carve out a portion of the nation’s vast and rapidly growing aviation market. But they will soon have to share the spotlight with Comac, a company that has a built-in advantage in dealing with Chinese airlines.

Despite investing heavily in aircraft assembly facilities in China, Airbus may soon see its edge over rival Boeing eaten away as the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is expected to enter the narrow-body plane market with its C919 jet next year.

In November 2020, Boeing estimated Chinese airlines would acquire 8,600 new aeroplanes valued at US$1.4 trillion and commercial aviation services valued at $1.7 trillion over the next 20 years. Both Boeing and Airbus have stepped up their presence in China to try to secure a piece of the pie.

Airbus has provided China Eastern Airlines with single aisle A320 family jets from its Tianjin assembly line for years, and last month delivered its first A350 widebody passenger jet.

The Tianjin assembly line, which was established in 2008, is a joint venture between Airbus, the Tianjin Free Trade Zone and the state-owned aerospace and defence company China Aviation Industry Corporation

“Given the expected future strength of the Chinese market and the rise of Comac, it is strategically highly important for Airbus to maintain its strong local presence,” said John Strickland, director of the aviation consultancy JLS Consulting.

While assembly plants are only a small part of the manufacturing process, analysts say having in-country facilities is important to win business in the critical Chinese aviation market.

China is already about 25 per cent of the global market. They both need to be there Andrew Charlton

Airbus has a first mover advantage over Boeing, which only set up its first assembly plant in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, in 2018 in a joint venture with Comac.

Despite the global pandemic, Airbus delivered 99 planes to China last year and 64 more in the first half this year.

“Assembly plants in China are very important to both Airbus and Boeing,” said Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy.

“China is already about 25 per cent of the global market. They both need to be there.”

But he added the C919 will “eat into their narrow-body jet market” and the international aviation giants are likely to place more focus on their widebody planes, for which Comac does not yet have an answer.

While investing in an assembly facility is vital to growing business in China, there is no guarantee it will help navigate political tensions.

Boeing’s sales in the world’s second largest economy have taken a dive amid growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The company’s 737 MAX is also still grounded in China after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2019.

Boeing’s president and chief executive David Calhoun said in an earnings call on July 28 he anticipated the narrow body passenger jet would be recertified in China by the end of this year.

Before China grounded the 737 MAX in March 2019, after the second fatal crash, Boeing was selling a quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers.

As evidence of progress, a Boeing 737 MAX jet departed the United States for China on Wednesday to conduct a flight test as part of efforts to gain approval from Chinese authorities, Reuters reported.

“I’m very encouraged about the constructive nature of [recertifying the 737 MAX in China] … hopefully bigger trade issues don’t get in the way. I don’t believe they will. Both sides are incentivised for this industry to move forward,” Calhoun told analysts on the call.

“I don’t want to imply that anything is risk-free on this front. It’s not, it never will be. Especially as it relates to China relations, which are real. ”

Beijing wants to reduce its reliance on imports and become a world leader in aviation manufacturing, something made clear in – among other policy documents – its “Made in China 2025” industrial modernisation plan.

As a result, Airbus and Boeing are also likely to be careful with their outsourcing strategy, said David Yu, professor of finance at New York University Shanghai and an aviation financing expert.

“The point is not to outsource everything, the point is to have some items completed in these facilities,” he said. “From a manufacturing point of view, it’s about intellectual property protection and the safeguarding of that.

“The point is to develop a long-term perspective on China, to grow relations with stakeholders, the airlines and regulators such as Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) – it’s helping them to get planes here.”

In June, the US and the European Union (EU) agreed to a truce in their near 17-year conflict over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus and to establish a working group to address “non-market practises” in other countries, most notably China.

The truce is unlikely to see Boeing and Airbus cooperate, but could allow them to focus on dealing with new threats like Comac, said Yu.

Airbus and Boeing have so far favoured working with Comac rather than against it because of the huge size of China’s aviation market, Charlton said.

Both companies have also accepted that competition with the state-owned firm is inevitable when the C919 comes into service.

“That Airbus is ahead of Boeing is in no small measure a political thing, not a technology thing,” Charlton said. “For Airbus to start too with the A350, which is a widebody, means there is no direct competition and is politically astute.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.737630307674408}",positive,0.737630307674408,1
Last stop on Earth at Airbus before odyssey to Jupiter for JUICE - Airbus,"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOC1sYXN0LXN0b3Atb24tZWFydGgtYXQtYWlyYnVzLWJlZm9yZS1vZHlzc2V5LXRvLWp1cGl0ZXItZm9yLWp1aWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Final integration and test in Toulouse before 2022 launch to meet tight interplanetary schedule

Almost nine year journey for four year mission around Jupiter moons: could there be new life habitats?

Toulouse, 12 August 2021 – The Airbus-built JUICE spacecraft, (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission) developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) has arrived in Toulouse, where it will stay for its final assembly and test campaign at Airbus’ satellite integration centre, before being shipped to Kourou in French Guiana for launch on Ariane 5.

After three months of intense activities for thermal vacuum testing in the Large Space Simulator (LSS) chamber at the ESA test centre at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands, JUICE is back at Airbus, the prime contractor. Unusually, it was transported by air to Toulouse, to save time so that it remains on track to meet the tight interplanetary schedule to reach the Jovian system.

Cyril Cavel, JUICE project Manager at Airbus said on arrival: “It’s the first time I have seen a satellite arriving in Toulouse by plane, which shows the importance of this mission for ESA and the scientific community. Now we at Airbus have to build on the great work of all of our industrial and scientific partners. I can’t wait for this ambitious mission to launch and to see the tremendous progress to human knowledge it will bring – even though we will have to wait almost 10 years, before it arrives at Jupiter!”

Opening of the pressurized protective container and transfer to the clean room has already been completed. Airbus will now finalise the flight configuration assembly including integration of the last instrument units and the largest satellite solar arrays ever to fly for planetary exploration. Last but not least, the environmental tests, including electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC), mechanical, deployment, and propulsion, will continue through until next year in the run up to launch.

The 6.2 ton JUICE spacecraft will set off in 2022 on its near 600 million-kilometre long journey to Jupiter. The spacecraft will carry 10 state-of-the-art scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, an ice-penetrating radar, an altimeter, a radio-science experiment, and sensors to monitor electric and magnetic fields and the plasma environment in the Jovian system. JUICE will complete a unique tour of the Jupiter system that will include in-depth studies of three potentially ocean-bearing moons: Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.

During its four year-long mission, JUICE will collect data to understand the conditions for giant gaseous planet formation and the emergence of deep life habitats. It will spend nine months orbiting the icy moon Ganymede analysing its nature and evolution, characterising its sub-surface ocean, and investigating its potential habitability.

As prime contractor for ESA, Airbus is leading an industrial consortium of more than 80 companies across Europe.

Airbus building vertical integration supply chain - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Tue, 03 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMTA4LzAzL1dTNjEwODhlMDZhMzEwZWZhMWJkNjY2MjhiLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Employees work on SACI's production line for Airbus A220 in Shenyang, Liaoning province. CHINA DAILY

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it has been rebuilding and diversifying the layout of its global supply chain since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is willing to see more Chinese enterprises become its suppliers as it is forming a ""vertical integration supply chain in China"".

Over the past decade, Airbus has constantly expanded its supply chain network in China, its largest market. So far, it has more than 200 suppliers in China, including 23 tier-one suppliers from whom Airbus purchases parts and components directly.

The tier-one suppliers are located in Tianjin; Xi'an, Shaanxi province; Chengdu, Sichuan province; Harbin, Heilongjiang province; Shenyang, Liaoning province; Hangzhou, Zhejiang province; and Taichung, Taiwan province, Airbus said.

""We are forming a vertical integration supply chain in China, meaning we purchase raw materials and parts, do the parts assembly and deliver the aircraft in China to lower costs of transportation and raise efficiency,"" said Yang Xiaoyu, Airbus' head of flyable procurement in China and East Asia.

""We also hope to develop more local Chinese suppliers that are in line with global standards of Airbus.""

Airbus said it would continuously increase the production rate of the single-aisle A220 aircraft, a model to which 15 Chinese firms supply one-third of the airframe. The 100- to 150-seat A220 is equipped with five seats in a row for its economy class. The model fills the gap between regional aircraft and regular single-aisle aircraft such as the A320.

""The global aviation industry is still casting a cloud on the future due to the pandemic, and international travel is stagnant. The A220 serves as the only Airbus model that has seen a stable production rate since the pandemic. The A220 is expected to become a bright spot in the downturn of the global aviation market,"" said Li Min, senior marketing director of Airbus China.

The plane maker said Chinese suppliers have shown a strong motivation and intention to meet the manufacturing criteria of Airbus. Airbus applies the same standards and methodologies of manufacturing in China, Europe and everywhere else in the world.

For instance, SAC Commercial Aircraft International Ltd, a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corp of China, based in Shenyang, Liaoning province, Northeast China, is a major supplier to the A220 project. SACI has delivered 400 forward fuselages and rear barrel sections, 100 hatch doors, 100 tail cones and 100 mid-fuselage of the A220 to Airbus so far.

To date, the A220 has received about 650 orders from more than 25 carriers globally. The aircraft model, however, is not operated in China yet. Airbus said it is in discussions with a number of Chinese airlines and they have shown interest in purchasing the model. The A220 is also in the process of getting airworthiness certificate in China.

Airbus said its main target market for the A220 in China is western China, a region that boasts top tourism resources but where high-speed trains do not have any distinct competitive advantage, given the vast land.

Last year, Airbus' annual industrial spending on the commercial aircraft business in China reached about $1 billion, up almost 60 percent from the 2016 level, it said.

""Airbus' increasing investment in China shows its recognition of China's manufacturing skills and the capacity of the civil aviation industry chain in China,"" said Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9763219356536865}",neutral,0.9763219356536865,0
Airbus Says New Narrow-Body Planes Could ‘Complement’ Chinese Craft on Regional Routes - Caixin Global,"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYWl4aW5nbG9iYWwuY29tLzIwMjEtMDgtMDkvYWlyYnVzLXNheXMtbmV3LW5hcnJvdy1ib2R5LXBsYW5lcy1jb3VsZC1jb21wbGVtZW50LWNoaW5lc2UtY3JhZnQtb24tcmVnaW9uYWwtcm91dGVzLTEwMTc1MzA2Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has localized some of the A220’s manufacturing in China, where a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corp. of China is responsible for producing the core airframe.

European aircraft-maker Airbus said its new narrow-body planes could complement China’s domestic competitor on less-busy regional routes, as investors try to gauge just how much of a threat the country’s push to use more of its own aircraft might be to foreign plane-makers.

Airbus China Marketing Director Hu Qin told a press conference on Friday that the company was “maintaining active engagement” with potential Chinese customers in the hopes of selling them planes from the A220 series, but did not give specifics.

His comments signal the company’s intention to grow its market share in China’s regional aviation market even as the country ramps up efforts to promote the use of its homegrown ARJ21.

The ARJ21, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC), seats 78 to 90 passengers and is considered a viable alternative for foreign-built craft on short- and medium-haul flights.

As of the end of 2020, COMAC had delivered 46 ARJ21 aircraft to customers including state-owned peers Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, according to the company’s website.

Airbus’s A220 is derived from the C Series single-aisle aircraft launched by Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier in 2016.

The A220 is now available in two variants, able to seat 120 and 150 passengers. That makes them smaller than single-aisle aircraft such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737, which are normally deployed on trunk routes with the ability to offer more than 150 seats.

The A220 series is suitable for connecting inland Chinese cities, where passenger traffic is relatively light compared to routes between major coastal cities, Hu said.

So far, Airbus has received orders for 648 A220 aircraft globally, 164 of which have been delivered, according to Hu.

Airbus has localized some of the A220’s manufacturing in China, where a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corp. of China is responsible for producing the core airframe.

The comments come as U.S.-based rival Boeing Co. tries to win regulatory approval for its 737 Max to return to Chinese skies.

On Saturday, Shanghai-based outlet The Paper reported that a 737 Max 7 had arrived in Shanghai for a flight test required by Chinese regulators.

Chinese aviation officials last month signaled they are open to conducting flight tests on the Max, in a step toward lifting its grounding in Boeing’s largest overseas market, more than two years after a fatal crash in Ethiopia in 2019.

This latest version of the H145 family is their sixth delivery in the company’s fleet renewal plan and the first five-bladed version to join the fleet. All remaining deliveries will consist of the new five-bladed H145 model and STARS has confirmed it will retrofit its initial five aircraft.

“By renewing our fleet with the H145, we deliver on our commitment to continually enhance the emergency care services we provide, as each life we save makes a huge difference in someone’s family, someone’s community,” said Andrea Robertson, CEO of STARS. “We are thrilled to now be introducing the five-bladed variant, and extend a warm thank you to the Airbus teams for their longstanding support of our critical missions here in Canada.”

STARS, a physician driven non-profit helicopter air ambulance organization, operates the H145 helicopters fitted with helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) interiors to provide safe, rapid, highly specialized emergency medical transport to patients in need across Western Canada.

The H145 was chosen after an independent review indicated the necessity for STARS to operate a unified, single-model helicopter fleet. In 2018, STARS published their fleet renewal plan for a total of nine H145 helicopters, the first of which was delivered in 2019. STARS recently increased their total order to 10 H145 helicopters.

“I remember when I first came to know STARS operating their BK117s, the predecessor to the H145, some of which we continue to support today, and it’s very special to me to see them taking delivery of the first five-bladed variant in North America, which will provide them with an even better tool to carry out the incredibly important, time-sensitive work they do saving lives every day,” said Romain Trapp, president of the North America region for Airbus Helicopters. “Airbus is proud to continue our support of their fleet renewal process, and we sincerely thank STARS for the trust they’ve placed in Airbus for more than 35 years, that continues today.”

This latest upgrade of the multi-mission H145 family adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor system, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 330 lbs. (150 kg), simplifying maintenance operations, and improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew. Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and Airbus’s own Helionix digital avionics suite, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload.

Airbus Helicopters is a leading supplier of helicopters in Canada and has been a proud member of the country’s aerospace community since 1984. Airbus Helicopters Canada has a 24/7 coast-to-coast network in place to support an in-service fleet of more than 760 helicopters nationwide. Across all its divisions – Helicopters, Commercial Aircraft, and Defence and Space – Airbus currently employs close to 4,000 people in Canada supporting aerospace throughout the country.

Qatar Airways grounds 13 Airbus A350s citing fuselage degradation - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIxLzgvNS9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWdyb3VuZC0xMy1haXJidXMtYTM1MHMtY2l0aW5nLWZ1c2VsYWdlLWRlZ3JhZGF0aW9u0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDIxLzgvNS9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWdyb3VuZC0xMy1haXJidXMtYTM1MHMtY2l0aW5nLWZ1c2VsYWdlLWRlZ3JhZGF0aW9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways said on Thursday that it grounded 13 Airbus A350s over what it described as fuselages ‘degrading at an accelerated rate’ in the long-range aircraft.

Qatar Airways said on Thursday that it grounded 13 Airbus A350s over what it described as fuselages “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft, further escalating a monthslong dispute with the European planemaker over the issue.

While Airbus declined to specifically discuss the announcement, Qatar Airways’ decision to ground the aircraft raised questions about the A350’s carbon composite fuselage, designed to make the twin-aisle aircraft lighter and cheaper to operate by burning less jet fuel. Qatar Airways is also one of the world’s top operators of the aircraft.

In its statement, Qatar Airways said it had been monitoring the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft for some time. It described the issue as a “significant condition”, without elaborating.

“Following the explicit written instruction of its regulator, 13 aircraft have now been grounded, effectively removing them from service until such time as the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition,” the airline said in its statement.

Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. The airline has another on order with the Toulouse, France-based aeroplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 aircraft — the most of any airline worldwide. In June, Qatar Airways said it wouldn’t take any more A350s unless the problem was fixed.

Airbus declined to specifically discuss Qatar Airways’ grounding.

“As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks / working with our customers,” a statement said. “Those talks we keep confidential. We have no further comment on our customer’s operations.”

Currently, Singapore Airlines is the world’s top operator of the A350, with 56 now in its fleet. The airline did not respond to a request for comment. In America, Delta Air Lines has 15 in its fleet. The Atlanta-based carrier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The A350 has a list price as high as $366.5m, though buyers often get discounts in bulk deals.

Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker is known for his hard-changing, confrontational approach in negotiating with manufacturers and others.

The airline will be the crucial carrier for fans attending the upcoming FIFA 2022 World Cup in this Arabian Peninsula country.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9937578439712524}",neutral,0.9937578439712524,0
Cabin Disinfection | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft,"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDgtY2FiaW4tZGlzaW5mZWN0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A single aircraft in a single day may see hundreds of people - passengers, crew and ground staff - entering its cabin. Each person will probably touch several surfaces - maybe even several times; from the cabin stowage bin to their seat buckle and arm-rest, from their touchscreen and tray to the bathroom facilities. So how can we reduce the risk of exposure to a virus in aircraft cabins?

Disinfecting cabins using existing or future technologies could mitigate the risk. Airbus has already conducted a series of studies, tests, simulations and analysis of new methods to establish their impact on the aircraft environment and materials.

Why review disinfection?

Several scientific studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain viable and infectious on surfaces for up to several days depending on the type of surface and the environmental conditions. Consequently, aircraft operators might be required by authorities to increase the frequency of aircraft cleaning.

Airbus has been working with numerous industry partners and regulatory agencies across the aviation network, and has tested different solutions for the aircraft interior - including the cabin, cockpit and crew rest areas - in regards to cleaning and disinfecting. These solutions are in addition to the methods already described in its Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and the Aircraft Maintenance Publication (AMP) for the A220.

Disinfecting: going beyond cleaning

Cleaning removes visible soil (such as organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and is normally accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilisation because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces can interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

Disinfection eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms on inanimate objects. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs and viruses, but by inactivating germs and viruses on a surface after cleaning, it further reduces the risk of spreading infection.

Exploring disinfection technologies, their benefits and disadvantages

First of all, testing had to take into consideration a number of factors including the efficacy of the solution, or how well it performed during tests; and its effectiveness, or how well it would actually perform in the real world. The process time to apply the solution would affect resources as well as turnaround time. Aircraft material compatibility needed to be studied in terms of discoloration, flammability, tensile strength and corrosion. And of course, it was key to consider the health and safety of staff handling the solution and of passengers and crew.

On top of what is already described in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), and in the Aircraft Maintenance Publication (AMP) for the A220, Airbus investigated several disinfection methods:

Electrostatic fogging and spraying

Gaseous hydrogen peroxide treatment

Ultra Violet (UV-C) light treatment

Thermal treatment and antimicrobial surfaces

Testing in Cabin Zero

Cabin Zero is an Airbus cabin test centre. The tests below were carried out in a cabin section mockup, within an environment close to that of a real aircraft.

Watch our ""A clean cabin for safe flying"" video on Youtube

Electrostatic fogging and spraying

These treatments are based on the generation of liquid droplets which will widely disperse the disinfecting liquid into the cabin. The main advantage of fogging and electrostatic spraying is that it enables large areas to be treated, in a short time frame. However, Airbus identified risks of accumulation of disinfecting agents that could be induced by the usage of these methods, as well as a potential effect on cabin material in the mid or long term.

How it works

Fogging is the indirect application of a disinfectant liquid as a mist or fog to an area. The purpose is to create and disperse a disinfectant aerosol to reduce airborne microorganisms and also to apply disinfectant to surfaces that may be difficult to reach. The term “fogging” means that generally small-size particulate matter (not gaseous) is suspended in the air.

The disinfectant is sprayed through a fogging machine which aerosolizes the liquid so that it is uniformly suspended in the air and can coat all surfaces in the cabin. Fogging is achieved using either a static, purpose-built system with strategically placed nozzles or, more commonly, a mobile unit.

Electrostatic spraying systems deliver charged droplets which are actively attracted to surfaces, including the back sides and crevices of surfaces, regardless of the direction of spray for complete wrap-around disinfection coverage.

Electrostatic spraying may enable a more targeted application using less disinfectant while producing fine particles with controlled shapes/sizes.

Electrostatic fogging and spraying can be done with handheld units, independently from on-ground equipment.

What benefits can be expected?

This quick method of disinfection and its effectiveness is known from other industries. The main interest of chemical fogging is to treat visible surfaces which may be touched by cabin and cockpit occupants, but also to treat non-visible surfaces as the very small particles containing the disinfecting agent are less influenced by gravity, stay in the air, and follow the airflow. Fogging with a smaller droplet size could enable less liquid to be used.

What about potential drawbacks and risks?

Material compatibility: disinfecting agents may adsorb* on, or be absorbed by the cabin and aircraft. (*Adsorb: cause a substance, usually a gas, to form a very thin layer on the surface of another substance)

Possible negative effects in the short term (such as a change of surface appearance or haptics) - or in the long term, mainly due to the accumulation of residual agents over time (such as corrosion, reduction of flame retardancy for soft materials).

Flammability: Fogging or spraying may create a flammable atmosphere when being used with inappropriate agents such as alcohol-based or other potentially flammable liquids.

On-ground staff need to wear appropriate protective equipment during the application process.

Spraying on a surface in an uncontrolled manner can result in health risks for humans (eyes, respiratory system, skin irritation, etc.). Moreover, the disinfectant may accumulate over time on surfaces and in materials, and hence may lead to undesired health effects.

Electrostatic fogging and spraying might damage electronic devices.

Airbus’ assessment

Fogging or large-area spraying may allow disinfectants to accumulate in non-visible aircraft areas. Mid and long-term effects regarding material compatibility in general and corrosion in particular, cannot be excluded when using these methods. Tests on soft materials have shown that the flame retardancy can be reduced depending on the chemical. These methods and associated potential effects would have to be closely assessed and monitored by the operator.

Treatment with gaseous hydrogen peroxide

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is commonly used as a strong bleaching agent and as a disinfecting agent (for example in medicine, waste water and in the food industry) and is highly efficient against bacteria and viruses.

Note that here we only refer to the gaseous form.

Gaseous hydrogen peroxide

Description

The hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) treatment is known as an oxidising agent and can lead to corrosion if a high humidity environment is created – only gas phase application is considered viable (low humidity). In a pure form it is a pale blue liquid, which can be diluted with water.

One method for air and surface disinfection is using hydrogen peroxide in gaseous form instead of directly applying aqueous solutions or spraying aerosols.

Three methods are commonly known to achieve the desired droplet-free generation of hydrogen peroxide gas: An airflow at ambient temperature is continuously blown over a high surface material that has soaked up a preheated aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. An airflow is dehumidified, then preheated above 100 °C; subsequently an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is injected which causes a flash evaporation. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide from natural humidity and oxygen already in the air is applied at ambient temperature.



What benefits can be expected?

The effectiveness of a disinfectant such as hydrogen peroxide is proportional to the disinfectant concentration in the air multiplied by the exposure time (at a given temperature and humidity level). In other words, it depends on the concentration of H₂O₂ reaching the surface and the dwell time.

According to a report from the FAA, 99% of viruses can be inactivated on surfaces when using hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 10 ppm (parts per million) during an exposure time of 2.5 minutes.

Potentially, H₂O₂ can be applied at very low concentration (<1ppm) even with the occupants in the cabin. The application time could therefore be longer without impact on turnaround.

It is an automated process via ground equipment or portable equipment distributed in the cabin.

The gaseous form enables very homogeneous disinfection within the cabin.

H₂O₂ disinfects against any kind of microbe (virus or bacteria).

What about potential drawbacks and risks?

Effective hydrogen peroxide concentration levels and exposure times against SARS-CoV-2 virus are subject to ongoing studies.

Risk of condensation on cold surfaces leading to subsequent corrosion.

Damage to materials (e.g. wool, leather, nylon, natural rubber, polysulfide sealants, etc.) when exposed to hydrogen peroxide at too high concentrations and/or exposure duration.

Potential effects on human health (skin and respiratory system).

Operators must wear protective equipment.

A release concentration of <0.5 ppm is required before people can enter an environment after hydrogen peroxide treatment.

Airbus’ assessment

There are potential risks of mid and long-term effects regarding material compatibility and for corrosion in particular. Turn Around Time (TAT) could be impacted by the waiting period required before people can enter the aircraft after the treatment process.

UltraViolet UVC Germicidal Irradiation

UltraViolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) uses short-wave ultraviolet (UV-C) energy to inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms. The effectiveness of this treatment depends on several variables including the applied UV wavelength, radiation intensity, the dwell time on a given surface, the nature of the germs to inhibit and the complexity of the surface geometry.

UltraViolet Germicidal Irradiation

Description

UVGI uses UV-C energy to inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms so they are unable to replicate and potentially cause disease.

UV-C energy disrupts the nucleic acids (DNA / RNA) in a wide range of microorganisms, rendering them harmless.

Early scientific studies established that the most effective UV wavelength range for inactivation of microorganisms is between 220 and 280 nm, with peak effectiveness near 265 nm.

The standard source of UV-C in commercial systems is low-pressure mercury vapor lamps, which emit mainly near-optimal 253.7 nm UV-C.

Disinfection could be reached by radiating the required UV-C on a given surface for a sufficient amount of time.

Products advertised on the market use tubular UV-C radiating lamps radiating at 254 nm installed either on a specific trolley that is moved manually along the aircraft aisle or with handheld devices (UV-C wands).

The required duration of exposure depends on the lamp performance, the distance and orientation to the surfaces to be treated, and the nature of germs to eradicate.

What benefits can be expected?

This quick method of disinfection and its effectiveness is known from other industries. It is semi- automated and could be a faster disinfection process with no residuals or consumables. It is highly efficient as an antiviral. No flammability impact has been noted.

What about potential drawbacks and risks?

There is a risk that some surfaces, like the angled lower side of the window armrest, receive less UV-C dose while the upper part of the seat headrest receives a higher dose with a risk of quick deterioration.

For efficient disinfection, movable parts of the cabin need an exposure to UV-C on both sides (e.g. tray table, arm rests, overhead bin covers, lavatory doors, etc.).

Although UV-C is known to not intrude beyond the dead skin layer, care is required as generally the high energy content of the radiation can have side effects on humans depending on radiated power, duration, and the body part which is being illuminated. Personal protection means must be considered to avoid any skin or eye irritation.

UV-C lamps contain mercury and therefore equipment must be designed to prevent any breakage of the lamps.

Though UV light has no effect on metals and ceramics, it affects the molecular bonds of polymers, leads to molecule chain scission and to the creation of radicals that may change the polymer properties (e.g. discoloring, disintegration, tensile strength).

Airbus’ assessment

There are potential mid and long-term effects regarding material compatibility (e.g. discoloration, reduction in tensile strength). The broad effectiveness of this method in the cabin environment is questionable due to several reasons, including the shadowing effect and required radiation intensity.

Thermal treatment

Thermal disinfection is a method using temperatures higher than usual ambient temperature. The effectiveness of the treatment lies in three variables: temperature (T), dwell time and relative humidity (RH).

Thermal disinfection - from 37°Celsius (dark purple) to 57°Celsius (light yellow)

Description

As stated in the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance on cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces, the COVID-19 virus survives in ambient temperatures but is susceptible to heat and standard disinfection methods. Thermal disinfection benefits from the sensitivity of viruses to temperature which, when combined with humidity, can render the virus ineffective.

What benefits can be expected?

Thermal disinfection in an aircraft environment (cabin, cockpit, crew rest areas) is an automated process which can be achieved by various means: Using airport ground support equipment such as Pre-Conditioned Air (PCA) to inject hot air in the aircraft through the low pressure ground connector or directly through the aircraft door. Using the aircraft Environment Control System (ECS) or so-called “air conditioning” system. Using remote electrical heaters positioned inside the cabin & cockpit and crew rest areas. Or a combination of the aforementioned.

Equipment installed in the cockpit, crew rest areas and cabin of all Airbus aircraft (except the A220) are qualified for temperatures up to 55°C/131°F when powered.

With heat as the solely effective measure to inhibit viruses, no additional chemicals would be required.

Ground equipment to perform the disinfection is commonly available around the world.

What about potential drawbacks and risks?

Potential risk of ageing effects on materials, due to repetitive warming.

Time required to perform this procedure is not compatible with turnaround time.

Logistics and preparations required to set up the procedure.

Potential impact on aircraft operational availability and on turnaround time.

At least 20% relative humidity is needed, which complexifies the whole process.

Airbus’ assessment

Airbus has conducted tests on its single aisle and widebody aircraft to demonstrate the practicality of any thermal disinfection method (e.g. temperature, duration). This was done in cooperation with medical institutes to evaluate the combination of variables which would allow virus inhibition through this method. Current results have not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion.

Disinfectants

Disinfectants are approved for use on Airbus aircraft if they have no damaging effects on the aircraft in terms of aircraft structure (i.e. corrosion), electronics and avionics (i.e. insulation of cables), sensors (i.e. smoke detection) or the interiors (i.e. installations, seat covers, curtains, monitors, media devices, windows, galleys, countertops, restrooms, etc.).

Due to the delicate nature of instruments, screens and components installed onboard the aircraft, only approved procedures and products must be used in accordance with Airbus guidance (AMM 12-21-12 and AMP 51-26 and AMP 51-31 for A220).*

On the contrary, some disinfecting substances must not be used on aircraft, such as biocidal substances for general disinfection. Operators should refer to the latest AMM (AMP for the A220).

*AMM: Aircraft Maintenance Manual - *AMP: Aircraft Maintenance Procedure

Cabin disinfection involves aviation partners and regulatory bodies throughout the industry, including the aircraft manufacturer, suppliers, authorities, and of course the operators and ground support teams.

In a collective effort to give a clear picture of possible options, Airbus has worked with other industry partners to test several different solutions for efficiency and feasibility.

Electrostatic spraying or fogging, Ultraviolet (UV) light, gaseous H₂O₂, thermal treatment, and antimicrobial polishes: these are some of the solutions which could be used in the future, independently or combined.

Each method presents benefits and drawbacks. Airbus continues to work actively with partners on alternatives which also include antimicrobial coatings, polishes and touchless features. In the meantime, Airbus recommends all operators to continue using the disinfection method referred to in the AMM and the AMP.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992884397506714}",neutral,0.9992884397506714,0
University of Zurich and Airbus grow miniature human tissue on the International Space Station ISS - Airbus,"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wOC11bml2ZXJzaXR5LW9mLXp1cmljaC1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWdyb3ctbWluaWF0dXJlLWh1bWFuLXRpc3N1ZS1vbi10aGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 26 August 2021 - With the next supply flight to the International Space Station (ISS), the Space Hub of the University of Zurich (UZH) and Airbus Defence and Space are bringing an experiment into space, which is intended to further advance the industrial production of human tissue in zero-gravity conditions. With this step, space could become a workshop for producing miniature human tissue for terrestrial use in research and medicine. Initial preparatory tests on the ISS 18 months ago were successful.



The process for the joint ""3D Organoids in Space"" project comes from Zurich scientists Oliver Ullrich and Cora Thiel, pioneers in research on how gravity influences human cells. Together with Airbus, they have developed the process to project maturity. The Airbus Innovations team led by project manager Julian Raatschen is developing the hardware and providing access to the ISS. From the idea to the first production test in space it took the project partners only three years to complete various test phases and highly competitive internal selection procedures. ""We are the first to show that the path to production in space is feasible, not in theory, but in practice,"" says Oliver Ullrich.

Improving drug development and reducing animal testing

Oliver Ullrich, professor of anatomy at UZH, biologist Cora Thiel and Airbus are using microgravity in space to grow three-dimensional organ-like tissues - so-called organoids - from human adult stem cells. ""On Earth, three-dimensional organoids cannot be produced without supporting skeletons because of gravity,"" Thiel explains. Such 3D organoids are of great interest to pharmaceutical companies: Toxicological studies could thus be carried out directly on human tissue without the need for animal models. Organoids grown from patient stem cells could also be used in the future as building blocks for tissue replacement therapy for damaged organs. This is because the number of donated organs is far from sufficient to meet the worldwide demand for thousands of donor organs.

3D organoids grown in space

The research conducted in March 2020, when 250 test tubes containing human stem cells spent a month on the ISS, was very successful: differentiated organ-like liver, bone and cartilage structures had developed as intended from the tissue stem cells in microgravity at an altitude of 400 kilometres. In contrast, the cultures created on Earth, which were grown as controls under normal gravity conditions, showed no or only minimal cell differentiation.

Robustness and viability

In the current mission, tissue stem cells from two women and two men of different ages are being sent into space. In doing so, the researchers are testing how robust the method is when using cells of different biological variability. They expect production to be easier and more reliable in microgravity than using support structures to grow on Earth. ""Currently, the focus is on production engineering issues and quality control."" With regard to the envisaged commercialisation, we now have to find out how long and in what quality we can keep the organoids grown in space in culture after their return to Earth,"" says Ullrich.

""If successful, the technology can be further developed and brought to operational maturity. Airbus and the UZH Space Hub can thus make a further contribution to improving the quality of life on Earth through space-based solutions,"" says Airbus project manager Raatschen.

The sample material will return to Earth at the beginning of October. First results are expected from November.

……

About the “3D Organoids in Space"" project

The joint project started in 2018. The teams from the UZH Space Hub and Airbus Defence and Space submitted their proposal to an Airbus internal innovation and ideas competition to obtain basic funding and start initial research work. There, the project successfully prevailed alongside 500 other ideas.

Today in a statement issued by the airline, Qatar Airways has mentioned that they have, following the explicit written instruction of its regulator, now grounded thirteen Airbus A350 aircraft; effectively removing them from service, until such time as the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition. 2 A350-1000s and 11 A350-900s are involved.

Qatar Airways has already taken action to return their A330 fleet into service, with immediate effect, to offset some of the impact of the grounded A350 aircraft and is presently looking at other solutions too.

In addition to the airline’s focus on protecting their reputation of offering the highest levels of customer experience, Qatar Airways is also cooperating with all the leasing companies affected by this A350 grounding; these leasing companies have also started to inspect their impacted aircraft.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “With this latest development, we sincerely expect that Airbus treats this matter with the proper attention that it requires. Qatar Airways will not accept anything other than aircraft that continue to offer its customers the highest possible standard of safety and the best travel experience that they deserve.""

Boeing to move 737 fan cowl manufacturing from Airbus to Turkish Aerospace and India's Tata - Flightglobal,"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL3Byb2dyYW1tZXMvYm9laW5nLXRvLW1vdmUtNzM3LWZhbi1jb3dsLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctZnJvbS1haXJidXMtdG8tdHVya2lzaC1hZXJvc3BhY2UtYW5kLWluZGlhcy10YXRhLzE0NDk5OS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing is making a supply chain shift that will see Turkish Aerospace and India’s Tata Advanced Systems take over 737 fan cowl production from Airbus in around 2025.

The US airframer confirmed on 9 August that Turkish Aerospace and Tata will share equally manufacturing of the 737 fan cowls.

Boeing declines to name the incumbent supplier, but several Spanish media reports and an industry source indicate the components have been produced by Airbus’s Spanish aerostructures operation.

Boeing says Turkish Aerospace will produce the cowls from 2025, with work to be performed at a facility in Ankara.

“The two companies’ close industrial collaboration supports the 737 programme’s performance and affordability while furthering the longstanding relationship between Boeing and Turkey’s aerospace industry,” Boeing says.

Tata will likewise start supplying 737 fan cowls from 2025, producing the components in Hyderabad, according to several Indian news outlets.

Boeing says it does not share information about incumbent suppliers. But a source familiar with the supply chain, and various media outlets, say Airbus’s aerostructures operation near Cadiz, Spain produces the cowls, having landed that supply agreement in 2013.

Airbus’ Spanish operation also makes fan cowls for Airbus A320neo-family jets, which are offered with CFM International Leap-1A powerplants. All 737 Max aircraft are powered by Leap-1B engines.

In June, Spanish news outlet Diario De Cadiz reported that Boeing had decided not to extend its cowl supply contract with Airbus.

Airbus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The airframer is restructuring its aerostructures division and is examining options for the Cadiz site, including its possible sale.

Boeing, which designs 737 cowls at its South Carolina propulsion site, declines to specify why it made the production shift.

“We are always evaluating our supply chain and needs across the business, and it’s not unusual for us to move work across suppliers based on business needs,” it says.

Boeing already has extensive operations in Turkey and India. Turkish Aerospace produces 737 elevators and various 787 components – elevators, cargo barriers and wing leading edges – in Ankara, Boeing says.

Last decade, Boeing and Tata formed a joint business called Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited to provide fuselages and other aerostructures for AH-64 Apache helicopters. Tata has also produced 787 floor beams, Boeing says.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999958276748657}",neutral,0.9999958276748657,0
Vega rocket set to launch next Airbus Pléiades Neo remote sensing satellite – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMTUvdmVnYS1yb2NrZXQtc2V0LXRvLWxhdW5jaC1uZXh0LWFpcmJ1cy1wbGVpYWRlcy1uZW8tcmVtb3RlLXNlbnNpbmctc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus-owned commercial optical Earth-imaging satellite and four small CubeSat rideshare payloads are set for launch Monday night from French Guiana aboard a European Vega rocket.

The 98-foot-tall (30-meter) Vega launcher is poised for liftoff from the Guiana Space Center, located on the northeastern coast of South America, at 9:47:06 p.m. EDT Monday (0147:06 GMT Tuesday).

The mission, managed by the French launch services company Arianespace, will deploy the second of four planned satellites in a modernized fleet of Airbus-built Earth observatories, joining an identical spacecraft launched on the previous Vega rocket flight in April.

Monday night’s mission will deliver Airbus’s Pléiades Neo 4 Earth observation satellite into a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of around 388 miles (625 kilometers).

The new satellite will take a position in a similar orbit as the Pléiades Neo 3 spacecraft that launched in April, but will fly in a slot 180 degrees from its counterpart to begin enabling repeat coverage of the same location on Earth.

The Pléiades Neo satellites feature improvements over Airbus’s first-generation Pléiades Earth observation satellites launched in 2011 and 2012. The final two Pléiades Neo satellites will launch together on an a Vega C rocket — an upgraded variant of the Vega launcher — in 2022.

Airbus says it entirely funded the development of the Pléiades Neo satellites, with intentions to sell the imagery commercially to private companies and government users. The company announced the Pléiades Neo program in 2016, and Airbus assembles the Pléiades Neo spacecraft at its facility in Toulouse, France.

The four-satellite program is costing Airbus about 600 million euros, or roughly $700 million.

The Pléiades Neo satellites can produce optical imagery of Earth’s surface with a resolution of 11.8 inches, 0r 30 inches, according to Airbus. That’s good enough to resolve features such as vehicles and road markings.

The imaging resolution of Airbus’s four Pléiades Neo satellites is comparable to the resolution provided by Maxar’s six-satellite WorldView Legion surveillance satellites due to begin launching next year. The companies are competitors, providing the highest-resolution Earth observation imagery on the global commercial market.

With the help of laser inter-satellite communications links, the Pléiades Neo satellites will be able to respond rapidly to tasking requests within 30 to 40 minutes, according to Airbus.

A single Pléiades Neo satellite, using a new agile pointing capability enabled by control moment gyroscopes, can turn side-to-side to observe the same location every two days. Once all four satellites are in orbit, the constellation will be able to image any location on Earth twice a day.

Each Pléiades Neo spacecraft is designed to operate for at least 10 years.

One Pléiades Neo satellite can collect images covering an area of nearly 200,000 square miles (500,000 square kilometers) every day, Airbus says.

Airbus released the first images from the Pléiades Neo 3 satellite in May. The company plans make commercial imagery from Pléiades Neo 3 available to customers later this year.

The 2,032-pound (922-kilogram) Pléiades Neo 4 spacecraft is enclosed inside the payload fairing of a European Vega rocket for liftoff Monday night from the Guiana Space Center.

The Vega rocket’s solid-fueled first stage will quickly propel the launcher away from the spaceport in South America, steering the vehicle on a trajectory north from the tropical launch base over the Atlantic Ocean.

Producing around 680,000 pounds of thrust, the rocket’s P80 first stage booster will burn through its 97-ton (88-metric ton) supply of pre-packed solid propellants in less than two minutes.

The Vega rocket’s Zefiro 23 and Zefiro 9 second and third stage motors will fire next. The launcher’s payload shroud will jettison to fall into the Atlantic Ocean around four minutes after liftoff.

A liquid-fueled upper stage, known as the Attitude and Vernier Upper Module, will ignite two times to maneuver the Pléiades Neo 4 spacecraft into its targeted deployment orbit. The satellite is scheduled to separate from the AVUM upper stage about 54-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.

Two more burns by the AVUM upper stage will reduce the rocket’s altitude to around 344 miles (554 kilometers) for separation of four rideshare payloads more than an hour-and-a-half into the mission.

One of the rideshare payloads is a briefcase-sized six-unit CubeSat for a French startup company named Unseenlabs founded in 2015.

The small spacecraft, named BRO-4, is the fourth satellite in the company’s growing constellation designed to provide maritime surveillance services. The three previous satellites launched aboard Rocket Lab missions.

Unseenlabs says its fleet of nanosatellites will be able to locate and identify ships around the world, providing tracking services for maritime operators and helping security forces watch for pirates and smugglers. The company plans to build out a fleet of 20 to 25 nanosatellites by 2025.

Three small CubeSats sponsored by the European Space Agency are also set for launch Monday night.

The RadCube spacecraft is a three-unit CubeSat was developed by a Hungarian company named C3S. Designed as a technology demonstration mission, RadCube carries instruments to measure radiation and magnetic fields in low Earth orbit, collecting important data for space weather forecasting.

ESA’s SunStorm CubeSat, developed by Reaktor Space Lab in Finland, will test a miniature solar X-ray flux monitor measuring X-ray missions from coronal mass ejections, huge eruptions from the sun’s surface that can generate space weather storms affecting satellite operations, and power grids and communications networks on Earth.

The instrument to be tested on the SunStorm nanosatellite is similar to a sensor ESA plans to fly on a future operational space weather monitoring mission.

The third ESA-supported CubeSat on Monday night’s launch is LEDSat, a small spacecraft developed by students at Sapienza University of Rome. The mission is designed to investigate the performance of Light Emitting Diodes as a way of tracking satellites in low Earth orbit, according to ESA.

ESA selected the LEDSat mission for a rideshare launch opportunity through the agency’s “Flight Your Satellite!” educational program.

"C919 launch rings alarm bells for Airbus, Boeing - Asia Times","Sun, 29 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4L2M5MTktbGF1bmNoLXJpbmdzLWFsYXJtLWJlbGxzLWZvci1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s wide-body C919 aircraft will soon be flying above the clouds — safe, inexpensive, comfortable and environmentally friendly — a clear message to powerful western aircraft manufacturers.

In the remaining four months of this year, an aircraft could be approved that could one day pose a threat to Airbus and Boeing.

And that comes as no surprise to Tobias Grosche, a professor at the University of Worms and an expert in flight planning and passenger demand forecasts.

“The fact that the first ‘COMAC’ aircraft is about to receive national approval is only the logical step in the efforts of the Chinese government, also in the aviation sector, towards the wester to unlock countries, ” Grosche told the Business Insider in a special report.

COMAC is the abbreviation for an amalgamation of Chinese companies that is likely to be viewed critically in Hamburg, Toulouse and Seattle.

It stands for Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and brings together design and research centers, universities, and aluminum and steel manufacturers.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers, depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install.

For comparison: the Airbus A320 flies for Lufthansa with space for up to 168 passengers, the Boeing 737 has space for around 150 passengers, i.e. similar sizes. The two types of aircraft are also similar in terms of range, the report said.

Depending on the version, the Airbus A320 can travel up to 5,700 kilometers, the Chinese counterpart C919 promises a range of up to 5,555 kilometers.

This means that the Chinese aircraft could, for example, reach all national destinations from Shanghai in eastern China — and get even further.

The major elements of the C919 such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC. Credit: COMAC.

Beijing has made no secret of its desire to break the western giants’ duopoly, helping smooth the C919’s development with up to US$72 billion in state-related support, according to estimates from US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

According to Simple Flying, the Shanghai Aircraft Airworthiness Certification Center of CAAC (SAACC) signed and issued the first Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) for the C919 program.

This means that the plane has officially entered into “authority certification” flight testing.

However, natural icing trials, which were set to take place in March 2021, have had to be postponed until fall.

While the aircraft is expected to be approved and will start scheduled service with OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of the largest airline in Asia, China Eastern Airlines, it is doubtful that this first-generation C919 will challenge the world’s aircraft manufacturers, Business Insider reported.

Not yet, anyway.

Says Grosche: “A second or third generation could be dangerous for Airbus and Boeing.

“Ultimately, it’s an economic question. If a Chinese model is efficient and safe, I see no reason why western airlines should not also operate these aircraft.”

After all, Lufthansa, for example, not only has Airbus and Boeing aircraft in its fleet, but also models from its subsidiary Cityline the former Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and the Brazilian Embraer.

Furthermore, Grosche is certain that COMAC will one day be able to offer the C919 for sale at comparatively cheap prices.

Even Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, has acknowledged COMAC’s rise, telling an industry event “we will probably go from a duopoly to a triopoly, at least on the single aisle, by the end of the decade.”

Overall, a total of 815 orders have been placed by 28 customers. China Eastern’s Big Three counterparts – China Southern and Air China will also deploy the C919, along with other powerhouses such as Joy Air and Hainan Airlines.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers, depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install. Credit: COMAC.

There has also been some international interest.

The head of the low-cost airline Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, announced ten years ago that he wanted to support alternatives to Boeing and Airbus and signed a non-binding letter of intent with COMAC, the report said.

And while Boeing and Airbus have the advantage of having been on the road around the world for decades, China, which historically plays the long game, is looking much further into the future.

The type CR929 is supposed to compete with long-haul airliners like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787.

And the type CR929-600 could have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers and space for up to 280 passengers.

What are Boeing and and Airbus up against? The C919 will be state-of-the-art, both inside and out, along with some refreshing updates.

While the major elements of the airplane such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC, the company has enlisted Western expertise, notably that of French high-tech industrial group and aero-engine manufacturer Safran, which is producing the aircraft’s cabin and nacelles, CNN Travel reported.

The C919’s LEAP-1C engines are being produced by CFM, a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran. Subsidiary Safran Cabin says it will supply the lavatories, galleys and cockpit doors for the C919.

The company told CNN that “the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft.”

That will be welcome news for passengers forced to do contortions in modern airplane toilet compartments.

More spacious lavatories would mean it would be possible to move around with less contact with surfaces, and it could also make cleaning and maintenance a less onerous task for the crew that scramble on board between flights to disinfect the toilets — a boon in the Covid era.

The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized galley with ample space for the flight crew to work.

Safran says it “recognizes that many of its airline partners based in China will fly these aircraft on short routes within China, which makes meal service a challenge.”

To address the compressed flight times on domestic routes, Safran says its cabin designers have come up with an “ergonomic galley design, with large work surfaces, equipped with easy-to-maneuver “Hybrite S trolleys,” which help the crew get meals, snacks and drinks out to passengers quickly.

Spacious galleys are also likely to be a selling point worldwide as airlines work towards complying with new inflight catering guidelines set out by the Airline Catering Association.

As for environmental concerns, Safran says it “has made advancements in its composite structures which enable interiors to be both lightweight and durable, helping to reduce carbon footprint while withstanding the rigors of short-haul service.”

The aircraft’s engines are also claimed to be more efficient.

The CFM LEAP-1C engine, which was selected by COMAC as the sole Western engine option for the C919, offers “a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines, and up to a 50% margin on NOx emissions,” says Safran.

The engines will also mitigate noise in and around the airports where the C919 operates.

The C919’s cockpit is being developed by the Chinese Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute (CARERI), and will feature integrated 15.4-inch avionic Display Head Assembly units coming from Barco Display Systems of Atlanta, Ga.

Why a Big 767 Air Cargo Operator Now Likes the Airbus A330 - FLYING,"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyLWNhcmdvLW9wZXJhdG9yLWxpa2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared on FreightWaves.com.

The Boeing 767 is Air Transport Services Group’s flagship freighter for its aircraft leasing and cargo airline businesses. Out of 110 aircraft currently in service, 91 are 767s. The medium widebodies are just the right size for express delivery linehaul routes — not too big, not too small — which require fast turn times and high load factors to make them economical.

So why is Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG betting big on the Airbus A330? The primary reason is fleet modernization using an aircraft that has recently become much more affordable and can carry even more cargo by volume than the 767.

Last week, the company announced plans to purchase 20 used A330s, convert them to freighters and lease them to express delivery operators and other customers. It has also placed deposits with a German maintenance and overhaul outfit to secure production slots two years from now.

ATSG is essentially a leasing company that offers many services around the leases — aircraft maintenance, outsourced cargo and passenger flight operations, charter brokerage, training, and warehouse and logistics services – to diversify its revenue stream.

Officials gave a detailed rundown on Friday of the A330′s merits and why the plane is a good fit for its business strategy.

CEO Rich Corrado said the A330-300 will be an excellent plug-and-play replacement for the 767s, which Boeing began building in the early 1980s. A330s began entering service more than a dozen years later and the -300 has about a 20% greater cubic space advantage over the 767. It can also carry about 8% to 10% more in weight.

The A330-200 is equivalent in size to the 767, is slightly more expensive to purchase in the secondary market and costs more to operate because it’s a heavier plane. It has long-range capabilities that aren’t necessary in an express environment but would be of value on other assignments.

Chief Financial Officer Quint Turner told American Shipper the company will consider both variants, depending on factors such as availability.

Officials have previously forecast about 200 767s still operating as passenger aircraft would make good conversion candidates based on their age. As the number of 767s dwindles over the next decade, the A330 will become the next-generation platform, Corrado said.

“The A330-300 looks to be a real solid solution for the same customers that the 767 is providing service for today. It’s a newer-generation aircraft,” he said.

There are about 200 A330s in prime conversion range of 13 to 25 years of age, according to company officials.

Three ATSG customers, including DHL Express, already use the A330 all-cargo aircraft. The in-house airline of Deutsche Post DHL Group has 12 A330s in service, according to Planespotters.net. Several of those are passenger-to-freighter A330-300s, which were converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke, a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore Technologies Aerospace that will also retrofit the ATSG planes. It has also purchased a few used A330 production freighters.

Corrado expressed optimism that DHL will lease the Airbus freighters and said talks are underway with other airlines.

Cheaper prices are one reason the A330 has recently become so attractive to ATSG. During the pandemic, many airlines were forced to cull their fleets to survive the implosion in passenger travel. Values for the A330 have dropped about 25%, putting the total cost of ownership on par now with the 767, according to the ATSG CEO.

“The economics make sense. … We think it’s going to be a long-term solution in the medium-wide body segment,” he said.

Chief Commercial Officer Mike Berger said the A330 also is a plane that its charter passenger subsidiary Omni Air International could use for its Defense Department contracts and provides interoperability with the Airbus A321 narrowbody freighter that ATSG is beginning to market.

ATSG is a joint venture partner in 321 Precision Conversions, which has designed and obtained regulatory approvals for a conversion package. The company is outsourcing the work to engineering outfits, including ATSG’s own conversion house, PEMCO. Two conversions are underway for outside parties and ATSG will begin receiving some converted A321s early next year.

Berger said the A330 and A321 have a common cockpit, which means pilots only require supplementary flight training rather than a full, new rating for a different aircraft type, making it easy to switch them between aircraft.

“There’s significant crew savings,” he said.

In the Driver’s Seat

Management reiterated that leasing aircraft offers long-term, consistent cash flow compared to providing cargo transportation, which is more volatile because of its exposure to supply-demand fluctuations.

“We just think long-term it’s a better use of that asset … versus putting it in a charter environment where we’ll get maybe a year-and-a-half of robust usage, but then we’d be back in a situation where we’d be getting into an intermittent usage on both the crew deployment and the asset,” Corrado said.

Airlines and logistics companies are booking leases up to two years in advance to ensure capacity because of the ongoing shortage of air cargo capacity and growth in e-commerce.

The strong market has put ATSG in a stronger negotiating position with new customers, as well as existing ones seeking lease extensions, Corrado said.

Companies with lease terms set to expire in the second half of the year are already asking for extensions. Under normal conditions, lease rates decline with each extension, but ATSG is now able to maintain rates, he added.

Between the A330 conversions and 47 more planned for 767s and A321s, ATSG could have more than 180 aircraft in its portfolio by 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8792061805725098}",neutral,0.8792061805725098,0

As first A220 operator in the CIS Air Manas will also become the first Airbus customer for components Flight Hour Services in the region.

The maintenance-by-the-hour service contract includes A220 material services with access to Airbus’ pool of parts and repair services. Bishkek-based privately-owned carrier will also benefit from Airbus’ engineering expertise to enhance the aircraft’s reliability and ease the fulfillment of lease return conditions.

“We are pleased to welcome Air Manas as our first FHS customer in Central Asia. We are building on our strong A220 component warehouses set-up to provide our new customer with the highest level of support. We are looking forward to contributing to Air Manas’ successful operation of its A220 fleet,” said Julien Franiatte, Head of Airbus Russia&CIS.

“It is a historical moment and honor for the new updated Air Manas after a long quarantine to be part of the big aviation world with the Airbus A220. We truly believe the Airbus Flight Hour Services will bring the highest level of service of flights with the A220”, Alexandr Belovol, shareholder of Air Manas, said.

The prospects and challenges facing Russia’s and CIS’ MRO industry will be discussed and thoroughly explored at the MRO Russia & CIS 2021 conference and exhibition (September 15-16), the 16th iteration of the largest annual event in Eastern Europe and Central Asia that is focused solely on covering the crucial issues of the MRO services for the region’s fast recovering air transport industry.

Air Manas entered service with its first Airbus A220-300 in May, 2021 on lease from Russia’s GTLK. The aircraft has a single-class layout with 145 passenger seats. The airline plans to add another aircraft of the type later this year (also via GTLK), and a further three by the end of 2023.

However, on July 28 Air Manas said it suspend its flight operations till autumn, citing «mastering of the new type of the aircraft, transition to a new strategy for the development of aviation in Kyrgyzstan and preparation for the opening of new destinations.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999552309513092}",positive,0.999552309513092,1
"Airbus announces A350 freighter, and conversion orders mount up - theloadstar.com","Fri, 20 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbG9hZHN0YXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hbm5vdW5jZXMtYTM1MC1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItYW5kLWNvbnZlcnNpb24tb3JkZXJzLW1vdW50LXVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Ian Putzger in Toronto 20/08/2021

Airbus has firmly signalled plans for a freighter version of its A350, with interest from the likes of DHL and UPS.

But the action has been much livelier on the conversion side: Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), the plane-maker’s joint-venture with ST Aerospace, is garnering orders to turn passenger planes into an all-cargo configuration.

EFW’s narrowbody conversion programme got a huge boost from US lessor BBAM, which has committed to taking 20 A320/321P2F aircraft over the coming three years, including two A321 freighters ordered last month to be leased by Lufthansa Cargo.

According to EFW, the order is equivalent to a full conversion line with a minimum of five slots a year.

The freighters are scheduled for delivery through to 2025, and the agreement includes an option for BBAM to add new conversion slots every year from 2026.

Steve Zissis, president & CEO of BBAM, views the A320/321 as the up-and-coming narrowbody freighter.

“We have committed to the A320/A321P2F programme well into the future – beyond 2026 – because we see it as a greener and highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and as an excellent way to drive value for our investors,” he said.

The first converted A321 freighter entered service in January, about two months before EFW inducted an A320 to kick off the conversion programme for the smaller type.

An A320 freighter can carry ten AAA pallets plus one PAG ULD on its upper deck and another seven on the lower deck – one fewer main deck pallet position than the rival B737-800 all-cargo plane.

The A321 will likely play some role in the segment contested by the A320 and B737NG freighters, but primarily it is seen as the successor to the slightly larger B757-200F. The A321P2F can take 14 pallets on its main deck and another 10 in the belly, for a payload of 28 tonnes and a range of 3,500 km.

The parcel carriers are expected to constitute the main clientele for the type, but Lufthansa also sees merit in it and intends to mount an intra-European operation with two A321P2Fs next year, based at its Frankfurt hub.

CEO Dorothea von Boxberg said: “Lufthansa Cargo wants to offer customers in the e-commerce segment fast intra-European connections. With the converted A321s, we are meeting our customers’ growing demand for same-day solutions and further strengthening our dense network of global connections and product offering.” And she added, when the decision was announced in July: “In addition to forwarders, integrators and postal operators, e-commerce providers will be customers for this offering.”

The clamour for freighters has stretched order cycles. Zach Young, director of sales & marketing at conversion specialist 321 Precision Conversions, reports that the company has sold all its A321 conversion slots until mid-2023 and B757-200 conversion slots are sold out until August of next year.

EFW has also seen an uptick in demand for converted A330 freighters. This month, ACMI provider ATSG, which has so far focused on Boeings, secured 20 conversion slots for A330s with EFW, to be carried out in the US, Singapore and China, and expected to run from mid-2023 until late 2025.

The conversion outfit is ramping up capacity. It intends to deliver five converted A330s before the end of this year and next year wants to finish 15 A330 conversions. A recruitment drive to attract 300 new employees is under way.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9371097087860107}",positive,0.9371097087860107,1
Cathay Pacific flexes its wings with new hi-tech Airbus plane - South China Morning Post,"Tue, 03 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvaG9uZy1rb25nL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDM2ODkvY2F0aGF5LXBhY2lmaWMtZmxleGVzLWl0cy13aW5ncy1uZXctaGktdGVjaC1haXJidXMtcGxhbmXSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvbmcta29uZy90cmFuc3BvcnQvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQzNjg5L2NhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLWZsZXhlcy1pdHMtd2luZ3MtbmV3LWhpLXRlY2gtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5l?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GBA will start a series of test flights from August 15 overseen by the city’s aviation regulator, a key stage in securing permits to start flying. The upstart’s first branded Boeing 737 was seen emerging from a maintenance hangar in Guangzhou in Guangdong province last week.

“There will always be competition, but with the introduction of our product, we believe it is a big testimony to our continued investment in the customer experience. I believe it will be the most enjoyable experience in regional flying,” Vivian Lo Wing-yee, Cathay’s general manager for customer experience and design, said at the aircraft’s unveiling at Hong Kong International Airport.

Hong Kong’s largest airline, which will launch its first commercial flight with the new plane on Wednesday, is flexing its wings as GBA inches closer to securing regulatory approval to launch later this year.

With the A321neo, Cathay has secured bragging rights to a world first – an aircraft with in-flight entertainment screens packing 4K resolution. The plane also offers more reliable high-speed Wi-fi, and will use the same economy class seats as the ones available on its long-haul flights.

The aircraft can seat 202 passengers, 30 more than the previous iteration of the A321, after gaining extra room by repositioning aircraft doors and toilets, as well as shrinking the space for business class. Legroom in economy extends 30 inches, two inches less than on long-haul flights.

But some travellers have bemoaned a missed opportunity of introducing fully reclining business class seats in line with regional competitor Singapore Airlines.

With the border between Hong Kong and mainland China still largely shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of Cathay’s national routes operate once a week.

Cathay has chosen Shanghai’s Pudong Airport for the A321neo’s maiden flight, but with the airline’s flights less than 20 per cent full all year, only a handful of travellers are expected to be on board.

Lo insisted that when passengers eventually returned, they would see a variety of improvements but she remained coy about the changes.

“This is only the beginning, and with the progressive reopening, we do see continuous improvement in customer experience to be launched, so we are quite confident in our future,” she said.

The aircraft displayed by the airline was previously painted in the colours of the now-defunct Cathay Dragon, but it never served a paying passenger as the regional carrier was shut down last October amid cost-cutting measures by its parent company.

Cathay Pacific is banking on winning back the vast majority of its lucrative China routes that were held by Dragon – 326 flights across 21 routes to an array of mainland cities.

The airline will unveil its financial performance next week for the first six months of 2021. It delivered an upbeat assessment in June on its financial health for the next six months, saying aggressive cost-cutting had slowed its monthly cash burn rate. While it still expected a “very substantial loss” in the first half of 2021, the amount would be somewhat lower than the HK$9.87 billion (US$1.27 billion) lost in the first half of last year, and the HK$11.78 billion in the second half of 2020, the company told analysts.

Yang Xiaoyu, the company’s Head of Flyable Procurement in China and East Asia, says Airbus is building a “vertical integration supply chain” to source parts and materials, assemble, and deliver aircraft locally.

Yang Xiaoyu says the strategy will “lower costs of transportation and raise efficiency”, adding that Airbus will also work collaboratively with local Chinese suppliers to bring them “in line with global standards of Airbus”, strengthening its ties and capabilities across the territory.

China on Track to World’s Largest Aviation Market

Further expansion into China is unsurprising given the nation’s continuing emergence as the world’s economic superpower. It is steadily becoming the world’s biggest aviation market, and is a strategic territory to Airbus for deliveries and global production.

China already accounts for around a quarter of Airbus’s global commercial aircraft production, with more than 1,700 Airbus commercial jetliners in service in China as of the end of 2018. Even under the pandemic Airbus delivered 99 plane to China in 2020 and 64 in the first half of 2021, despite on-going disruption and widespread downturn in aviation.

China Central to Airbus Supply Chain Expansion

The country is also a strategic hotspot in Airbus’ global supply chain. The European aerospace giant established a final assembly line (FAL) in Tianjin, a port city in northeastern China, in 2008. It was the first to be built outside the borders of its four founding European countries - France, Germany, Spain and the UK.

It expanded the site to include a wide-body completion and delivery centre in 2017. In July 2021, the production site delivered the first Airbus A350 to China Eastern Airlines. George Xu, Airbus Executive Vice President and Airbus China CEO, said: “This is a new milestone in the long-term cooperation between China and Airbus, which further demonstrates Airbus’ commitment to the country.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8875520825386047}",positive,0.8875520825386047,1

Company’s boss added that the German carrier was “in line with their previous announcements”, saying that they will “use this crisis to have major modernization”.

“If you would confine that to long-range only, the A380 will obviously not come back.

The carrier will benefit from integrated material services including spare pool access, on-site-stock at the main base and components engineering and repairs. Through the FHS contract, Airbus will guarantee spare parts availability, contributing to securing aircraft technical performance.

Mikail Houari, President of Airbus Africa & Middle East, said: “Signing this agreement with flyadeal is an important milestone; it is the 1st FHS contract in Saudi Arabia and the biggest Airbus aircraft fleet to be covered by FHS”.

“We are proud of our partnership with flyadeal and look forward to continuing working together. This agreement reaffirms our commitment to supporting Saudi Arabia’s aviation sector”, Houari added.

Airbus has finalised 11 Flight Hour Services contracts with operators worldwide over the last six months. The latest contract agreements demonstrate the continued interest in Airbus’s integrated maintenance service, proving more relevant than ever in post-crisis times when airlines need to carefully monitor their costs and contain investments.

What's Going On With The Doors Of The Airbus A321? - Mentour Pilot,"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS93aGF0cy1nb2luZy1vbi13aXRoLXRoZS1kb29ycy1vZi10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | August 29, 2021

Its length is the same, so why has Airbus changed the layout of the doors in some newer A321 aircraft? For a good reason, as it turns out!

The devil is in the details, they say. When we see new versions of aircraft we tend to notice the big stuff. These can be more powerful engines, maybe a new winglet design, or a tailcone (in the MAX!). Or maybe we’ll mull over new seats, seat-back entertainment and the all-important (…) WiFi. But what about the doors we walked through, to get in the plane in the first place?

OK the changes in the doors of the A321 we will look at here, don’t really affect the doors we’re likely to use. But they are still quite important, for us AND the airline. However, other than a quick glance at the safety card in our seat pocked, most of us don’t really think of these things. But perhaps we should.

The A321 is the largest (for now?) member of Airbus’ A320 single-aisle family. In its original guise, the plane would typically seat around 200 people. This number could vary considerably, depending on the airline and the number and type of available seat classes. The exit configuration of the A321 was quite straight-forward: it had four doors on either side.

Doors And Some A321 Ideas And Innovations

For planespotters and aviation geeks (like yours truly), this made the A321 very easy to spot. Not sure if you’re looking at an A320 or A321? Just look at the doors – if it has overwing exits, it’s an A320, not an A321. Well, this was then. Nowadays, this little rule of thumb doesn’t work. As you can see in the pictures, now some A321s look decidedly different. But why?

The manufacturer calls it the “Airbus Cabin-Flex”, or ACF. The frontmost and rearmost doors on either side are the same. Gone is the door just in front of the wing. Then we have two overwing exits over each wing. And the doors just behind each wing of the new A321, have moved back slightly (four frames). That’s it – on the outside, anyway.

It’s a different layout, but not exactly alien; many other aircraft have the same arrangement. But re-engineering an existing design is not something companies jump into just randomly. So, why did Airbus go to the trouble of re-arranging the doors on its A321? Airbus calls it “Flexibility”, others might call it “Capacity”.

The exit limit of the original A321 was 220 seats (later 230, with more conditions, beyond doors). The ACF layout allows newer A321neos to have as many as 244 seats! But the new layout isn’t just about satisfying aviation authorities. With their new doors, these A321 airliners actually have more room for seats. The floor-to-ceiling doors can’t have seats next to them. Overwing exits can, and do!

A321 – Doors With Seats Next To Them

That, in a nutshell, is why the doors in the new A321 aircraft look the way they do. Originally, Airbus intended to make the ACF arrangement optional. We recently revisited the A321LR and XLR. Airbus initially called the A321LR the “A321neo ACF (LR)”. This jet brought along an increase in maximum take-off weight (MTOW). So offering the extra seat capacity, gave airlines more options.

But Airbus soon realized that many other airlines could use an A321 with these updated doors. Low-cost carriers LOVED the idea. With 240 passengers, per-seat efficiency goes up by another 6%! Airbus claims that with the ACF layout, plus the ‘neo’ engines (P&W GTF or LEAP-1A) plus the winglets, an A321neo is 20% more efficient (per seat) than an early A321ceo.

Moving the rear (waist) doors four frames back is a bit easier than having them closer to the wing. And while the A320 already had overwing exits, the ones on the A321 are a different design, because of a regulation change (thank you to Jürgen Heuwetter for pointing this out; check the comments section). So introducing this change wasn’t straightforward. And there are other downsides, e.g. that the layout with the overwing exits is around 100kg/220lbs heavier. The ACF door layout is more expensive to make, too.

But it doesn’t matter. Being able to put ten (or more) people on board per flight, quickly covers the extra cost. Same for the extra weight. The new doors were an A321 option, when the A321LR was launched in 2018. From 2020 onwards, they are standard for all A321neos. The MTOW increase (97 metric tons, or 214,000lbs) remains an option.

What If You Don’t Want Many Seats In Your A321neo?

You’d think that these doors wouldn’t matter to airlines that don’t use LCC-style, single-class layouts in their A321 fleets. But as it turns out, airlines like the ACF layout. Having two doors in front of the wing allows boarding of business and economy passengers separately, on different jetways. But few (if any) airlines would care to do this with an A321.

As before, airlines putting fewer seats in their A321 fleets, can ‘plug’ the doors behind the wing. This is a semi-permanent modification; it is reversible, but only during maintenance. Still, it allows airlines to put seats where those doors would have been. And if they later decide to sell these planes, the new customer can activate these doors.

There is more emphasis now on bigger single-aisle aircraft. Airbus is seeing this quite dramatically. The original A321ceo accounted for around 22% of orders for the whole A320 family. The A321neo variants today make up 50% of ALL A320neo family orders! Nobody expected this, including Airbus. So they’re scrambling to increase the number of assembly lines that can handle the longer A321neos.

So Airbus likes to give options to A321 customers, and these doors and layouts are big factors in them. And this matter brings us to something else, too. Have you seen discussions on-line, where people complain about seat space and comfort?

Many people rush to accuse aircraft manufacturers or the airlines, about cramming more people in the same planes. Well – factually, they do. But it doesn’t mean that they do so by robbing us of available space. As this article shows, sometimes they create more space! And our seats today are much thinner (and lighter), too.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",neutral,0.9999938011169434,0
Jet2 Switches to Airbus! Is Boeing Getting Nervous? - Mentour Pilot,"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9qZXQyLXN3aXRjaGVzLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1pcy1ib2VpbmctZ2V0dGluZy1uZXJ2b3VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | August 31, 2021

Jet2 ended weeks of speculation, by announcing an order for Airbus A321neo aircraft. This is a dramatic switch, for an all-Boeing operator, possibly with far-reaching effects.

Rumors of a possible Jet2 switch away from Boeing, first came about a month ago. The UK-based operator and Airbus confirmed this news today. Their order is for a possible 60 Airbus A321neos. Of these, 36 are firm orders, the remaining 24 being options.

We just called Jet2 an all-Boeing operator, but over the years several Airbus aircraft have featured in their fleet. However, all of them were wet-leases, typically covering spikes in demand for the summer months. The only exception appears to be an A330, that Jet2 kept between April 2019 and March 2020. Also, in February of 2020, they leased a sole A321 from Avolon. They still have it.

Jet2 Evaluating Airbus Jets?

In previous years, Jet2 wet-leased just 1-2 jets (usually A321s) per season, always for a few months at a time. But 2019 was rather unusual. The airline wet-leased no less than four A321s, one A320 and two A330s! It now seems that these wet-leases, plus that sole A321, could have been part of an evaluation process.

Making a not-too-subtle dig at the 737 aircraft family, Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International, said:

“We very much welcome Jet2.com’s decision. Traditionally having been operating non fly-by-wire aircraft, we note with great satisfaction that after having tested a couple of leased A321s and run a comprehensive evaluation, Jet2.com is forward-looking and investing in modern and future proof Airbus fly-by-wire technology. This is a testimony to Jet2.com’s vision of efficiency, quality, performance and environmentally friendly flying.”

Airbus A321neo: Jet2 Refleeting AND Upsizing

Jet2’s bread-and-butter jet is the Boeing 737-800, with 75 of the type in their current fleet. They also have 8 757-200s, of which 5 are in storage. The Airbus A321neo would be a good replacement for the 757s in the Jet2 fleet. But with the numbers involved here, the airline seems to be upsizing its fleet. Their 737-800s have 189 seats; the upcoming A321neos will have 232. There is no mention of any other, smaller Airbus aircraft in the Jet2 order.

The only aircraft in Boeing’s inventory that would match the A321neo in size, would be the upcoming 737-10. And while it is not ready yet, it will be in 2023, when Jet2 will receive its first Airbus A321neos. Deliveries will take until 2028 to complete. Still, Airbus’ gain is Boeing’s loss. And it comes at a time when other airlines are coming forward with wide-ranging re-fleeting plans.

We already mentioned Air-France/KLM, who are looking to replace 160 737-800s with KLM and Transavia. They are also aiming to homogenize the all-Airbus Air-France and all-Boeing KLM and Transavia single-aisle fleets. This promises to be a major battle between the two airframers. But it’s certainly not the only one.

A Buyer’s Market?

Ryanair just reiterated their interest in the 737-10. But they are saying that a deal within 2021 is unlikely, because Boeing’s pricing isn’t favorable. So the Jet2 switch to Airbus could be a factor here, especially if Boeing has no upcoming sales to announce. Ryanair could order up to 250 737-10s. However, some could come from switching current firm 737-8200 orders, of which they have 210.

The A321neo that Jet2 is getting is 20% more efficient (per-seat) compared to early A321ceos, according to Airbus. But this assumes a capacity of 240-244 seats, with the appropriate interior and doors, as we saw recently. With 232 seats, Jet2’s can either claim a more generous seat pitch, or offer options for seat upgrades.

Jet2 will decide what engines its new Airbus fleet will have, at a later date. In all, the news is good for Airbus, who now claim that the A320neo family has secured 7,400 firm orders. But interestingly, Jet2’s shares fell 1.7% with the news, as pandemic restrictions still make the UK market nervous.

Leasing Firm to Convert 18 Airbus A321 Passenger Jets to Freighters - FLYING,"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYmJhbS1jb252ZXJ0aW5nLWEzMjEtamV0cy10by1mcmVpZ2h0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared on FreightWaves.com.

Aircraft leasing company BBAM Limited Partnership on Monday placed the largest order to date for the new Airbus A321 converted freighter, which is attracting growing attention from express delivery companies and airlines supporting parcel networks that are experiencing rapid growth in e-commerce business.

The San Francisco-based leasing services provider said it signed a contract with Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between original equipment manufacturer Airbus and Singapore’s ST Engineering, to convert 18 of the narrow-body passenger jets into full freighters. The deal essentially locks up a full production line for BBAM through 2025 and comes with the option to add new conversion slots every year starting in 2026.

BBAM, which manages leases for investors that own aircraft, has already converted and redelivered two A321 converted freighters to Titan Airways, a U.K. charter airline, for a total of 20 orders so far.

BBAM spokesman Matt Dallas said two of the reconfigured freighters will be leased to Lufthansa Cargo. The Lufthansa cargo subsidiary last month said it plans to add two A321s to its all-cargo fleet and outsource the flying to regional passenger carrier Lufthansa Cityline, a sister company, but did not disclose where it was acquiring the aircraft. Lufthansa expects the freighters to enter service in early 2022.

The feedstock for conversions will come from BBAM’s portfolio, which totals more than 500 aircraft.

Demand for all-cargo aircraft has never been more intense, with global cargo capacity down more than 12 percent from pre-pandemic levels and shipping volumes at near-record levels. Nearly every airworthy freighter has been put to use in the past 18 months, and more airlift will be slow to materialize because modifying aircraft takes several months each and conversion shops are booked up. Last week, Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) said it placed deposits with engineering outfits to secure 67 conversion slots over the next 3 1/2 years for three different aircraft types.

BBAM is taking a diversified approach to investment in converted narrow-body freighters, with 31 orders and commitments so far with Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) for converted 737-800 freighters. In July, the leasing company added a dozen aircraft to its original order.

“Our commitment to the P2F programme demonstrates our confidence in the ability of EFW and ST Engineering to deliver long-term value enhancement for the A320s and A321s in our fleet,” said BBAM President and CEO Steve Zissis in a statement. “We have committed to the A320/A321P2F programme well into the future—beyond 2026—because we see it as a greener and highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and an excellent way to drive value for our investors.”

EFW said many of the conversions for BBAM will be carried out at ST Engineering’s airframe facility in the U.S. The company previously said that ST Engineering will be adding an A321 conversion line at its VT Mobile Aerospace facility in Mobile, Alabama.

EFW was first out of the blocks to introduce a design for modifying the A321 to carry cargo containers and pallets on the main deck. The first plane was delivered last October to Qantas to support Australia Post. Prior to the new BBAM order, EFW had logged about 17 orders from leasing companies for the A321 passenger-to-freighter conversion.

321 Precision Conversions, a U.S. joint venture between Portland, Oregon-based Precision Aircraft Solutions and ATSG, earlier this year delivered its first A321 converted freighter to a European customer and recently began retrofitting aircraft based on recent design approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Another competitor, Nanchang, China-based Sine Draco Aviation Development Ltd., is also preparing its first prototype of the A321 in all-cargo configuration.

Turning used passenger airplanes into freighters is a complex undertaking that requires specialized repair shops to make structural changes, to include cutting a large opening in the fuselage for a cargo door, stripping out seats, reinforcing the floor to support heavy loads, installing a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit from shifting freight and covering windows.

Although Boeing has a three- to four-year head start in the midsize freighter category for conversions, aviation experts say the A321 is likely to prove a worthy competitor because of a design that allows containers—not just breakbulk cargo—to be carried in the lower deck. The large payload, plus fuel efficiency and long range, provide operators a high degree of operational flexibility. The A321 freighter has a payload of about 61,800 pounds and a range of more than 2,300 nautical miles.

It also is considered an excellent replacement candidate for aging Boeing 757 converted freighters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996711015701294}",neutral,0.9996711015701294,0
A measure of the wind - Airbus,"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA4LWEtbWVhc3VyZS1vZi10aGUtd2luZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"T

hree years ago saw the launch of Europe’s Aeolus wind measuring test satellite to trial the first ever Doppler Wind lidar – a laser radar – in space. It has proven so effective that its measurements are now used in daily forecasting – no mean feat given this was never part of the mission plan.

So what was the plan? To test the use of satellite-borne lidar technology – enabling permanent measurement from much higher altitudes than balloon-borne instruments – for global wind-profiling around the globe. This data is vital for meteorologists and climatologists to improve weather forecasts and better understand the dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere and climate variations. Accurate wind forecasts are also crucial for activities such as farming, fishing, construction and air transport.



A rocky start

However, breaking new ground in space technology is never easy and Aeolus was no exception. Development of the highly complex lidar instrument for this European Space Agency (ESA) mission was particularly challenging – an example being the strength of the laser within the lidar which, when a prototype was first tested, proved so strong that it was destroying the laser’s optics at a rate of 50% in under six hours. At the time this was a huge set-back for the team but ultimately solving the problem created new technology that will support a number of future missions.

Aeolus infographic – forecasting our daily weather

The moment of truth

On 22 August 2018, ESA’s Aeolus satellite was launched and within a week came the moment our engineers had all been waiting for: switching on of the lidar instrument and its first emission of ultraviolet pulses. It is these pulses which enable Aeolus to take a 0km-25km slice of the atmosphere and, using a laser and Doppler Effect, make an accurate wind-map at all latitudes with a 250m resolution. The first results didn’t disappoint.

From super-powered to sub-powered

In the first several months of operations, Aeolus continued to demonstrate its lidar was up to the job, but then signs of energy loss were observed on the laser transmitter, threatening to compromise data quality. But, being a test satellite, a back-up laser had been built in to the design and the Airbus and ESA teams worked together to make a successful switch over to the second laser. Far from being seen as a failure, the first laser nevertheless notched up almost one billion shots and provided a vital first dataset of its kind.

From strength to strength

Since then, Aeolus has consistently delivered high quality data and has gone above and beyond its original mission. From stepping in to provide missing wind measurements that used to be taken by planes before covid, to its data being deemed so valuable that it has been adopted for daily weather forecasting. Indeed, the volume of data also clearly sets it apart, since this one satellite is delivering more wind data than all existing ground-based measuring systems. And after three years in orbit Aeolus has now exceeded its design lifetime and is still going strong.

Philippe Pham, Airbus’ Head of Earth Observation & Science concludes: “That Aeolus data is now being used as part of the operational weather forecasting flow demonstrates its quality and reliability. Built as a one-off research mission, Aeolus is truly exceeding all expectations – testament to our engineers’ skill and determination in developing this new technology. Its success also paves the way for a possible future fleet of Doppler wind Lidar satellites in space.”

Not bad for a test satellite.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6335432529449463}",neutral,0.6335432529449463,0
Airbus KC-30A Works Singapore DSTA on Automated Air Refueling - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Sun, 08 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC9haXJidXMta2MtMzBhLXdvcmtzLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1kc3RhLW9uLWF1dG9tYXRlZC1haXItcmVmdWVsaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By the Australian Defence Business Review

Airbus has announced it has completed the development phase of its A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT)-based automated refuelling system during trials with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

Completed in early 2021, the trials involved 88 fully-automated dry and wet contacts and transfers of nearly 30 tonnes of fuel to RSAF F-15SG and F-16D/D+ fighters. The trials follow an earlier series of tests which comprised seven automated hook-ups between an RAAF KC-30A and Airbus’s A310 MRTT testbed in 2018.

Dubbed SMART MRTT or A3R, the automated aerial refuelling capability is designed to reduce air refuelling operator (ARO) workload, improve safety, and to optimise the rate of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) transfer in operational conditions.

“We had the opportunity to test our system with different receiver types ensuring the right fit of our systems, while gathering extensive data key to completing the A3R development,” Airbus SMART MRTT Manager, Luis Miguel Hernández said in a May 20 release. “The team were able to test the limits of the system successfully, verifying its robustness and ability to automatically track receivers with varying configurations.

“We have built an extraordinary relationship based on mutual trust,” Hernández added. “Teams from all sides worked as a single unit during the test campaign and it is always a pleasure to fly with such a professional crew. They are the first partner nation involved in the development of the SMART MRTT, and we are honoured to have them on board.”

Nest step for the automated system is military certification by operators once the results of the trials have been examined. Current MRTT/KC-30A operators include Australia, the UK, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France, and NATO, while India has indicated its intention to order the aircraft. The UK does not operate with booms, so won’t use the automated system.

Delta continues fleet renewal with 30 additional Airbus A321neos - Future Travel Experience,"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:18:50 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1dHVyZXRyYXZlbGV4cGVyaWVuY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvZGVsdGEtY29udGludWVzLWZsZWV0LXJlbmV3YWwtd2l0aC0zMC1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share on LinkedIn LinkedIn Share on Twitter Twitter Share on Facebook Facebook Share on Reddit Reddit Share on Flipboard Flipboard Share on Tumblr Tumblr Share via Email Gmail Share on WhatsApp WhatsApp

Delta Air Lines has reached an agreement with Airbus to add 30 A321neo aircraft to its order book. The airline has stated that this transaction reinforces its strategic fleet objectives to boost operational simplification, achieve economies of scale and drive productivity.

“Adding these aircraft strengthens Delta’s commitment to replacing older fleets with more sustainable, fuel-efficient jets, and offers the best customer experience in the industry,” said Mahendra Nair, Delta’s S.V.P. – Fleet and TechOps Supply Chain. “Delta appreciates the extensive partnership with the Airbus team in support of our strategic growth plans, and we look forward to continuing to work together throughout the recovery and in the years ahead.”

The A321neo is Delta’s most fuel-efficient large gauge narrow-body aircraft and is well-suited to complement Delta’s domestic network.

Delta is converting purchase rights for the aircraft into firm orders under its existing A321neo purchase agreement with Airbus. It follows a similar transaction in April, when Delta and Airbus converted 25 A321neo purchase rights into firm orders and added 25 incremental A321neo options.

The airline currently operates 121 of the larger gauge A321ceo family, and with the incremental A321neos announced has purchase commitments of 155 firm A321neo, in addition to six remaining A321ceo deliveries. Delta also has purchase rights for an additional 70 A321neos. These purchase commitments look ahead to Delta’s future needs, supporting replacement of older, less fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft. In total, Delta now has 288 aircraft purchase commitments, including both wide-body and narrow-body jets.

Delta expects to take delivery of its first A321neo in the first half of 2022, with deliveries of these aircraft continuing through 2027.

“Our partners at Delta are underscoring the strategic role the A321neo will play as the highly efficient platform for Delta’s renowned customer service and reliability for many years into the future,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.

The A321neo is powered by next-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines, which achieve 12% better fuel efficiency on a per-seat basis than the A321ceo aircraft. The engines will be maintained by Delta TechOps technicians at its advanced maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities in Atlanta.

Delta’s A321neos will be equipped with total seating for 194 customers with 20 in First Class, 42 in Delta Comfort+ and 132 in Main Cabin. The new aircraft will be deployed across Delta’s extensive domestic network, complementing Delta’s existing Airbus A321ceo fleet of 121 aircraft.

"Airbus freighter plans gather pace as UPS, DHL eye new planes - American Journal of Transportation","Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqb3QuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWZyZWlnaHRlci1wbGFucy1nYXRoZXItcGFjZS1hcy11cHMtZGhsLWV5ZS1uZXctcGxhbmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: Charlotte Ryan, Siddharth Philip and Thomas Black | Aug 12 2021 at 11:00 PM | Air Cargo

Airbus SE’s dedicated freighter is drawing interest from major cargo firms, after the European planemaker got board approval to launch the jet late last month.

Airbus confirmed in late July its directors had signed off on a plan to produce a freighter version of the A350 jet by 2025, enabling it to counter rival Boeing Co.’s dominance of the market. The company is now authorized to make formal sales pitches to potential customers, with United Parcel Service Inc., DHL Worldwide Express and Qatar Airways gearing up for purchase decisions.

UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman said July 27 that while the company’s existing order book is sufficient to meet requirements for the next three years, it is working on a review of longer-term needs. A spokesman for DHL said two days later the company is interested in both the A350F and Boeing’s 777X freighter, while Air France-KLM is looking at how to take advantage of a strong cargo market, potentially with an additional plane.

Demand for freighters has boomed during the pandemic, as stuck-at-home shoppers turned to e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. to buy goods. This exposed Airbus’s relatively weak market position when compared with Boeing, forcing a rethink from Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury.

While Boeing has freighter versions of its 777, 767 and outgoing 747 models, Airbus’s only foray into the market has been the failed cargo version of the smaller A330. The dedicated freighter market only accounts for about 80 plane sales a year, but would still be a good target for the European company, according to Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa.

“If Airbus can get 10 A350 freighters a year at the moment, they’d be laughing,” he said. “Assuming they can develop the A350 at an acceptable price, that would be well worth doing.”

Old Planes

Airbus plans to keep widebody jet production rates low for the foreseeable future, currently building just five A350s a month as the airline industry struggles to recover from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Scooping up a share of the freighter market would help bolster the commercial jet program, with further cargo growth expected.

Israel Aerospace Industries, one of the world’s biggest conversion specialists, said this week that it had begun making modifications on its first passenger Boeing 777-300 jetliner, a process that will take about 130 days to repurpose it for freight.

Tusa said rules on emissions standards coming into force in 2028 will create further demand for new planes.

“There are a lot of freighters that were kept in service for longer than expected because of the pandemic but which are objectively old, tired and not very fuel efficient,” he said.

Strong Platform

According to Airbus’ Faury, the company’s new cargo jet will have 40% less fuel burn than four-engine freighters such as the Boeing 747 model. That should make it an attractive choice for customers, he said.

“It’s a very good case for us,” Faury said on a July 29 conference call. “We have a very strong A350 platform and bringing a freighter version makes a lot of sense.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9814239144325256}",neutral,0.9814239144325256,0
Airbus Aircraft to Integrate Collins' Next-Gen Sensor for Enhanced Visibility - autoevolution,"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLWludGVncmF0ZS1jb2xsaW5zLW5leHQtZ2VuLXNlbnNvci1mb3ItZW5oYW5jZWQtdmlzaWJpbGl0eS0xNjcxNDkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Highly-advanced sensors that drastically improve pilot visibility are not just limited to military use. Commercial airplanes are also starting to integrate the latest tech when it comes to visibility, making commercial flight not only safer, but (indirectly) more fuel-efficient.

Collins Aerospace recently showcased some of its latest military aviation technology, at the U.S. Navy League’s Global Maritime Exposition, including an air-combat training system and the MS-110 and MS-177 family of systems (FoS) that provides cutting-edge image resolution and an extended coverage area. Now, Collins announced that Airbus has selected its next-generation sensor, to be integrated into the Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS).Located on the nose of the aircraft, this sensor will enable an augmented reality view of the outside environment. In poor visibility conditions, when the human eye can only detect so much, the sensor’s multiple infrared and visible light cameras allow the pilot to get an accurate view of what’s going on outside. Especially in the case of fog of rain, which are often responsible for flight disruptions, the pilot can get a better image of the runway, by viewing the camera video on head-up displays.And there’s a secondary benefit. Since better visibility means fewer delays on the runway or in-flight, it’s also a way of reducing carbon emissions and cutting costs. By integrating the sensor into the Airbus EFVS, airlines all over the world will be able to benefit from this technology. For now, the sensor will be implemented on the A320 aircraft, with plans of adding other platforms as well, in the future.The Airbus A320, an aircraft that’s available in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), was introduced as the “longest-range single-aisle aircraft. This meant new travel opportunities around the world, with these aircraft capable of flying almost anywhere, and taking off from urban runways to remote airports, located at high-altitudes.The EFVS, which will now incorporate the Collins next-gen sensor, is designed to provide exceptional situational awareness.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9995101690292358}",positive,0.9995101690292358,1

""Following Board approval, we are enhancing our product line with an A350 freighter derivative, responding to customer feedback for increased competition and efficiency in this market segment,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in the European manufacturer's 1H21 financial report.

He clarified that the freighter would be largely based on existing A350 passenger variants, the A350-1000 in particular. The aircraft will be assembled at Airbus's existing facilities at Toulouse Blagnac airport without the need for any significant investment in new assembly lines. The manufacturer hopes to benefit from the recent experience in developing the A330-700ST BelugaXL, an A330 subtype which it uses for in-house outsized cargo transportation.

""The beauty of the programme is that it will be embedded in the A350 production system, so we don't have to plan for an individual production rate [for the freighter],"" Faury said.

Faury said that the A350 freighter would have a capacity north of 90 tonnes, although he did not go into any details concerning its projected performance data.

The A350(F) will pit Airbus against rival Boeing in a market segment that has thus far been dominated by the American company. The European manufacturer currently produces a single purpose-built freighter type, the A330-200F, but in practice, the programme appears to have run its course as Airbus has no more unfilled orders for it. The ch-aviation fleets module shows that only thirty-eight A330-200Fs were produced. Airlines also operate three A330-200(P2F)s and seven A330-300(P2F)s, as they see the P2F conversions of A330-200s and A330-300s as a more viable option.

""There’s a strong utilisation of cargo capacity but still a lot of old [aircraft], and we see a wave of replacements for the second half of the decade. [We’ve] been quite absent from the widebody freighter market so far. It’s time for airlines to see some competition,"" Faury said.

Airbus ended the production of its previous A330-based freighters over a decade ago, with the last A300-600R(F) delivered to FedEx Express in July 2007. The vaunted A380-800(F) was dropped never having made it off the drawing board. In contrast, Boeing currently offers two new-build freighter types, the B767-300F (199 built and a further 51 on firm order) and the B777-200F (208 built and 46 on firm orders). The American manufacturer also proffers converted freighters based on the B767-200, the B767-300, and soon the B777-300(ER) passenger types.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8868353366851807}",positive,0.8868353366851807,1

The new orders by BBAM bring the total number of its A320/A321P2F to around 20, with the conversions to be carried out by EFW through 2025. The agreement comes with the option to add new conversion slots every year starting in 2026.

“With this latest order, BBAM is now the largest aircraft lessor for the A320/A321P2F programme and one of the top P2F customers of EFW,” said Andreas Sperl, chief executive officer of EFW. “The order volume by BBAM translates into a full conversion line with a minimum of five slots per year, with many of the conversions to be carried out at the airframe facility of our parent company, ST Engineering, in the U.S. When combined with top-notch conversion standards, our A321P2F solution offers unique benefits for air freight activities, including best-in-class economics, reduced noise, lower carbon footprint, real-time health monitoring and the highest level in reliability.”

“Our commitment to the P2F programme demonstrates our confidence in the ability of EFW and ST Engineering to deliver long-term value enhancement for the A320s and A321s in our fleet,” said Steve Zissis, president and chief executive officer of BBAM. “We have committed to the A320/A321P2F programme well into the future – beyond 2026 – because we see it as a greener and highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and an excellent way to drive value for our investors.”

In January this year, BBAM announced the delivery of the world’s first Airbus A321P2F on lease to Titan Airways.

Airbus Gets a Much-Needed A330neo Order - The Motley Fool,"Sun, 01 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzAxL2FpcmJ1cy1nZXRzLWEtbXVjaC1uZWVkZWQtYTMzMG5lby1vcmRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Condor will add 16 A330neos to its fleet over the next three years.

Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) has navigated the COVID-19 pandemic with much greater ease than top rival Boeing (BA -1.90%). The European plane maker has consistently delivered dramatically more commercial aircraft than its American counterpart, and its backlog advantage over Boeing has grown.

That said, Airbus' wide-body lineup has remained a weak spot: particularly the A330neo. Fortunately, the company landed a new A330neo order last week, which will buy it much-needed time to shore up its backlog.

A strategic weak point

Last year, Airbus delivered 566 commercial jets. Meanwhile, Boeing handed over just 157, as the 737 MAX wasn't recertified for commercial service in any markets until near the end of the year. While the 737 MAX has now been approved to return to service in 175 countries -- with China and Russia being the notable holdouts -- it hasn't helped the U.S. aerospace giant much so far. Airbus delivered nearly twice as many commercial jets as Boeing in the first half of 2021.

Airbus also has a dramatically larger order backlog. As of June 30, it had 6,925 firm orders in its backlog, compared to 4,155 for Boeing.

However, Boeing remains the wide-body market leader, although its advantage has shrunk over time. In the first half of 2021, it delivered 43 wide-bodies, despite a series of production miscues impacting its best-selling 787 Dreamliner family. Airbus delivered 39 wide-body jets during that period. Furthermore, Boeing has 821 wide-body orders in its firm backlog, compared to 775 for Airbus.

The A330neo -- which competes directly with Boeing's 787 -- is in particularly bad shape. Airbus ended June with 268 firm orders for the A330neo. That may seem like a sizable number, but many of these orders are likely to be cancelled in the future.

Indeed, top customer AirAsia X -- which has ordered 78 A330neos -- is teetering on the brink of insolvency and plans to slash its order book. Garuda Indonesia, with 13 outstanding A330neo orders, faces a similar situation. Additionally, Iran Air ordered 28 A330neos but won't be able to take any of them unless the U.S. lifts its current sanctions. Aircraft leasing firms account for many of the remaining disclosed A330neo orders, but they need to line up customers to take delivery of those aircraft.

A desperately needed order

Last week, Airbus announced that German airline Condor had committed to add 16 A330neos to its fleet, replacing the aging Boeing 767-300ERs it currently uses for long-haul flights. Deliveries will begin in late 2022 and run through 2024.

Condor will buy seven aircraft directly from Airbus. These appear to be ""white tails"" that were originally built for AirAsia X and Garuda Indonesia. It will lease the other nine. While that won't directly lead to new orders for Airbus, it ensures that leasing companies will take delivery of some of the aircraft they have already ordered in the near term.

Staying afloat

Last year, Airbus slashed production of the A330 family to just two per month. So far, it has no plans to increase output beyond that level.

At this production rate, Airbus will struggle to make much (if any) money on A330s. But there's no guarantee that Airbus can sustain even a two-per-month production rate. In the first half of 2021, the aircraft manufacturer delivered just seven A330s: barely more than one per month. Finding enough near-term customers to keep production at a minimum of two per month could be crucial for protecting the A330neo's long-term viability.

In this context, the Condor orders and relatively quick delivery schedule will help in a big way. Between U.S. airline giant Delta Air Lines and Condor, Airbus has now filled at least half of its A330 delivery slots for the next three years (based on current production rates).

This gives Airbus a little bit of extra breathing room while the long-haul travel market recovers. However, the Condor order is just a start. Airbus needs existing A330neo customers to start taking delivery of the planes they have ordered -- and, ideally, to keep finding new customers -- in order to make its upgraded A330 successful.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8121931552886963}",negative,0.8121931552886963,-1
DJI drone use for outdoor Airbus A330 inspection creates European history - DroneDJ,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmVkai5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNS9kamktZHJvbmUtYWlycGxhbmUtaW5zcGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While it’s important to check out recently flown airplanes for any signs of damages or defects, aircraft inspection is a process riddled with many challenges. The aviation industry wants to modernize this system with smart, automatic drones. And in Europe, one company has achieved a major milestone by completing a fully automated outdoor airport drone inspection of a commercial aircraft at an active airfield.

Based in the Netherlands, Mainblades is a drone service provider that specializes in automated aircraft inspections. Earlier this week, they created European aviation history by using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone to autonomously inspect an Airbus A330 plane outside a hangar.

Typically, airports allow airplane drone inspections to be conducted only inside the hangar. Though pilot projects in front of hangars have been conducted in the United States, in Europe, this has never been allowed at an active airport.

Now, hangar space is expensive to rent and not always available for aircraft operators. This is especially true when unscheduled maintenance is required due to lightning strikes or other incidents. As Dejan Borota, cofounder and director of Mainblades, explains:

If an aircraft lands and it is damaged on the way, for example by lightning or birds, it must now first go to a closed location such as a hangar. That way you lose a lot of time. Besides this, hangar space is expensive to rent and not always available. And all that while a drone inspection can also take place in the open air.

So, to prove that outdoor inspections with drones could be conducted safely and efficiently, the Mainblades team landed at an active military airport in Woensdrecht on Tuesday. There, aircraft owner Truenoord made an Airbus A330 available for visual inspection by the DJI M300 RTK drone.

The drone took off for the job, looking for damages on the aircraft surface and taking high-res pictures that would show a lot more detail than that can be seen with the naked eye.

Why airplane drone inspection makes sense

Barota says using drones for aircraft inspections is beneficial not just for the aircraft owner but also for a lot of different parties in the aviation industry.

The first is the airline that has its operational fleet. They want to inspect the aircraft in the minimum possible time to optimize fleet availability. Next, you have the independent maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) organization that has tied up with the airline. They want to make sure the reporting interface and outputs are as consistent as possible. And then, there are aircraft lessors. Says Barota:

Approximately half of the world’s fleet of aircraft is actually not owned by the airlines themselves, but owned by leasing companies. And these leasing companies are involved when an aircraft has to go from an airline to an MRO, back to the lessor. At all moments they want to have an optimal picture of the status of the aircraft. So, they’re interested in ultimate inspection and having a complete report of these inspections.

Why a big 767 freighter operator now likes the Airbus A330 - FreightWaves,"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktYS1iaWctNzY3LWZyZWlnaHRlci1vcGVyYXRvci1ub3ctbGlrZXMtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMw0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3doeS1hLWJpZy03NjctZnJlaWdodGVyLW9wZXJhdG9yLW5vdy1saWtlcy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing 767 is Air Transport Services Group’s flagship freighter for its aircraft leasing and cargo airline businesses. Out of 110 aircraft currently in service, 91 are 767s. The medium widebodies are just the right size for express delivery linehaul routes — not too big, not too small — which require fast turn times and high load factors to make them economical.

So why is Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG (NASDAQ: ATSG) betting big on the Airbus A330? The primary reason is fleet modernization using an aircraft that has recently become much more affordable and can carry even more cargo by volume than the 767.

Last week, the company announced plans to purchase 20 used A330s, convert them to freighters and lease them to express delivery operators and other customers. It has also placed deposits with a German maintenance and overhaul outfit to secure production slots two years from now.

ATSG is essentially a leasing company that offers many services around the leases — aircraft maintenance, outsourced cargo and passenger flight operations, charter brokerage, training, and warehouse and logistics services – to diversify its revenue stream.

Officials gave a detailed rundown on Friday of the A330’s merits and why the plane is a good fit for its business strategy.

CEO Rich Corrado said the A330-300 will be an excellent plug-and-play replacement for the 767s, which Boeing began building in the early 1980s. A330s began entering service more than a dozen years later and the -300 has about a 20% greater cubic space advantage over the 767. It can also carry about 8% to 10% more in weight.

The A330-200 is equivalent in size to the 767, is slightly more expensive to purchase in the secondary market and costs more to operate because it’s a heavier plane. It has long-range capabilities that aren’t necessary in an express environment but would be of value on other assignments.

Chief Financial Officer Quint Turner told American Shipper the company will consider both variants, depending on factors such as availability.





Officials have previously forecast about 200 767s still operating as passenger aircraft would make good conversion candidates based on their age. As the number of 767s dwindles over the next decade, the A330 will become the next-generation platform, Corrado said.

“The A330-300 looks to be a real solid solution for the same customers that the 767 is providing service for today. It’s a newer-generation aircraft,” he said.

There are about 200 A330s in prime conversion range of 13 to 25 years of age, according to company officials.

Three ATSG customers, including DHL Express, already use the A330 all-cargo aircraft. The in-house airline of Deutsche Post DHL Group has 12 A330s in service, according to Planespotters.net. Several of those are passenger-to-freighter A330-300s, which were converted by Elbe Flugzeugwerke, a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore Technologies Aerospace that will also retrofit the ATSG planes. It has also purchased a few used A330 production freighters.

Corrado expressed optimism that DHL will lease the Airbus freighters and said talks are underway with other airlines.

Cheaper prices are one reason the A330 has recently become so attractive to ATSG. During the pandemic, many airlines were forced to cull their fleets to survive the implosion in passenger travel. Values for the A330 have dropped about 25%, putting the total cost of ownership on par now with the 767, according to the ATSG CEO.

“The economics make sense. … We think it’s going to be a long-term solution in the medium-wide body segment,” he said.

Chief Commercial Officer Mike Berger said the A330 also is a plane that its charter passenger subsidiary Omni Air International could use for its Defense Department contracts and provides interoperability with the Airbus A321 narrowbody freighter that ATSG is beginning to market.





ATSG is a joint venture partner in 321 Precision Conversions, which has designed and obtained regulatory approvals for a conversion package. The company is outsourcing the work to engineering outfits, including ATSG’s own conversion house, PEMCO. Two conversions are underway for outside parties and ATSG will begin receiving some converted A321s early next year.

Berger said the A330 and A321 have a common cockpit, which means pilots only require supplementary flight training rather than a full, new rating for a different aircraft type, making it easy to switch them between aircraft.

“There’s significant crew savings,” he said.

In the driver’s seat

Management reiterated that leasing aircraft offers long-term, consistent cash flow compared to providing cargo transportation, which is more volatile because of its exposure to supply-demand fluctuations.

“We just think long-term it’s a better use of that asset … versus putting it in a charter environment where we’ll get maybe a year-and-a-half of robust usage, but then we’d be back in a situation where we’d be getting into an intermittent usage on both the crew deployment and the asset,” Corrado said.

Airlines and logistics companies are booking leases up to two years in advance to ensure capacity because of the ongoing shortage of air cargo capacity and growth in e-commerce.

The strong market has put ATSG in a stronger negotiating position with new customers, as well as existing ones seeking lease extensions, Corrado said.

Companies with lease terms set to expire in the second half of the year are already asking for extensions. Under normal conditions, lease rates decline with each extension, but ATSG is now able to maintain rates, he added.

Between the A330 conversions and 47 more planned for 767s and A321s, ATSG could have more than 180 aircraft in its portfolio by 2025.

Korean Air to oust all Airbus A380s within five years - AeroTime,"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjg2Mjcta29yZWFuLWFpci10by1yZXRpcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtd2l0aGluLWZpdmUteWVhcnPSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI4NjI3LWtvcmVhbi1haXItdG8tcmV0aXJlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXdpdGhpbi1maXZlLXllYXJzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the COVID-19 keeps taking its toll on international air travel, airlines are reviewing the future of their widebody aircraft. On August 19, 2021, Korean Air chief executive Cho Won-tae reportedly confirmed that the airline would retire all of its Airbus A380 aircraft by 2026.

“The A380s will be leaving Korean Air’s fleet within five years, and the Boeing 747-8I fleet will also follow suit within ten years,” Cho confirmed in an interview with FlightGlobal.

South Korea’s flag-carrier Korean Air currently has a fleet of 10 Airbus A380s, an average of 9.2 years, as per Planespotter.net data. At the moment, only one out of the 10 Super Jumbos is in service.

After a planned merger with Asiana Airlines, which is set to officially begin in 2022, Korean Air would be the world’s second biggest Airbus A380 operator, inheriting six Asiana’s Airbus A380 aircraft.

AeroTime News reached out to Korean Air for a comment but did not receive an answer at the time of publication.

Korean Air to be the eight operator to drop the Airbus A380?

In total, only 15 airlines in the world operated Airbus A380 aircraft. Korean Air happened to become the sixth airline to operate the Super Jumbo and might become the eighth to oust it.

Korean Air took its first delivery of its widebody aircraft on May 24, 2011. Powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 engines, the A380 featured a three class layout, with capabilities to seat up to 407 passengers. Features included a duty free showcase area, bar, and lounge on the upper deck for premium class.

“Korean Air was the first airline to purchase an Airbus aircraft outside Europe and they have now become an essential part of our fleet,” former CEO of Korean Air Yang Ho Cho was quoted in a statement written in 2011. “The exceptional, fuel efficient and environmentally friendly A380 that is being delivered today is perfect to assist Korean Air in advancing our goal of becoming a respected leading global carrier.”

The international air travel demand collapse brought by the COVID-19 pandemic has been cruel for the quadjet Airbus A380. Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA), Thai Airways, Air France, Hi Fly, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Malaysia Airlines have already discontinued flying Super Jumbos largely due to operational inefficiency and costly maintenance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999775886535645}",neutral,0.9999775886535645,0

The company said it has secured twenty A330 conversion slots with Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW). The announcement was made during the company's second-quarter earnings report.

ATSG has secured rights for 67 freighter conversion slots starting in 2022 through the end of 2025. These slots include Boeing 767-300s, Airbus A321s, besides the Airbus A330 aircraft.

Twenty A330 slots, acquired by CAM, will run from around mid-2023 through the end of 2025, with the majority likely to be at EFW’s facility in Dresden (DRS). CAM will continue to acquire aircraft to fulfil those slots and may even consider more beyond that, depending on the market, the company said.

“The A330 converted freighter, like our 767-300s will be a popular mid-sized option for our leasing customers,” Rich Corrado, president and chief executive officer of ATSG said. “The addition of an A330 option will provide our leasing business with a third platform for growth, and complements the A321 freighter we will also introduce next year.

Delta Orders Even More Airbus A321neos - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzI2L2RlbHRhLW9yZGVycy1ldmVuLW1vcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFuZW9zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The airline giant is aggressively modernizing its fleet, and Airbus has won the bulk of its orders.

In late 2019, Delta Air Lines (DAL 0.66%) revealed plans to gradually simplify its fleet while shifting toward larger aircraft over the course of a decade or so. The COVID-19 pandemic encouraged the airline to dramatically accelerate its fleet simplification and upgauging plans by retiring hundreds of aircraft ahead of schedule.

U.S. air-travel demand has recovered strongly this year. As a result, Delta has needed to retool its order book to replace all of the aircraft it has retired (or intends to retire in the near future). As part of that effort, the full-service airline recently firmed up orders for 30 more Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) A321neos.

Delta accelerates fleet retirements

Entering 2020, Delta Air Lines' fleet included 47 MD-88s averaging nearly 28 years of age, along with 30 MD-90s that were nearly 23 years old, on average. It planned to retire all of the MD-88s during 2020 and the MD-90s by the end of 2022.

Soon after the pandemic struck, Delta decided to accelerate the MD-88 and MD-90 fleet retirements to early June of 2020. Later in the year, the airline retired its 18 Boeing 777s and its 10 737-700s. Delta also announced that its 91 717s and 56 767-300ERs would all exit the fleet by the end of 2025. Lastly, it retired a handful of aging Airbus A320s and set plans to phase out all of its remaining 50-seat jets by the end of 2023.

Together, these retirements will eliminate seven mainline subfleets and three aircraft types (for pilot scheduling purposes) by the end of 2025. That will unlock substantial productivity gains and maintenance cost savings, on top of the usual fuel-efficiency gains and other cost benefits of next-generation aircraft.

More aircraft needed

These fleet simplification moves caused Delta Air Lines to end 2020 with 750 mainline jets in its fleet -- including temporarily parked aircraft -- down from 898 a year earlier. That figure included 84 717s and 767-300ERs that remain on track for retirement by 2025.

Meanwhile, air-travel demand snapped back faster in 2021 than many industry figures had expected. To be fair, demand has sagged a bit lately, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations associated with the Delta variant. Nevertheless, the strong rebound earlier this year suggests that demand will come roaring back as soon as case numbers start to decline again. That means Delta Air Lines needs to get its fleet back to full strength sooner rather than later.

After deferring many deliveries last year, Delta Air Lines ended 2020 with 33 mainline aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021, followed by 39 deliveries each in 2022 and 2023. Even with no additional aircraft retirements, this delivery schedule would not have returned Delta's mainline fleet to its pre-pandemic size until at least 2024.

A multipronged strategy

Delta Air Lines has implemented several strategies to address this issue. First, it has returned a handful of 717s, 767s, and A320s it retired in 2020 to active service.

Second, last month, Delta announced agreements to buy 29 used 737-900ERs and lease seven used A350-900s, capitalizing on the favorable prices available for used jets. All 36 planes will enter its fleet by the summer of 2023.

Third, the carrier has expanded its order book for the Airbus A321neo. In April, Delta firmed up 25 A321neo orders to replace some of the aircraft it retired recently. This week, it exercised another 30 purchase options, bringing its A321neo firm order tally to 155. Airbus plans to hand over Delta's first A321neo in the first half of 2022, with deliveries now stretching to 2027.

Together, these three initiatives should enable Delta Air Lines to get its fleet back to full strength by 2023, while cutting costs by reducing the number of aircraft types it operates and shifting the fleet toward larger, more modern aircraft.

Plenty more where this came from

Delta Air Lines now has 288 aircraft purchase commitments, up from 223 at the beginning of 2021. But it would need to acquire over 200 planes through 2025 just to maintain its mainline fleet at pre-pandemic levels.

Furthermore, Delta's 100 Boeing 757-200s are 24 years old, on average, while its 55 A320s are over 25 years old, on average. Most of these planes will need to be replaced by the mid-late 2020s.

Including replacements for other older aircraft in the fleet, additional small narrow-bodies to replace the 50-seat regional jets Delta is phasing out, and overall fleet growth, the company will likely need to buy 400 to 600 mainline jets over the next decade. As a result, investors should expect Delta to continue placing incremental aircraft orders in the years ahead.

After this week's order, the airline still has 120 options with Airbus for 50 A220s and 70 A321neos. That puts Airbus in great position to keep winning additional business from Delta.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9988399147987366}",positive,0.9988399147987366,1

Leasing Firm To Convert 18 Airbus A321 Passenger Jets To Freighters - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sZWFzaW5nLWZpcm0tY29udmVydC0xOC1haXJidXMtMjA1NjE0MjIyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft leasing company BBAM Limited Partnership on Monday placed the largest order to date for the new Airbus A321 converted freighter, which is attracting growing attention from express delivery companies and airlines supporting parcel networks that are experiencing rapid growth in e-commerce business.

The San Francisco-based leasing services provider said it signed a contract with Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between original equipment manufacturer Airbus and Singapore's ST Engineering, to convert 18 of the narrowbody passenger jets into full freighters. The deal essentially locks up a full production line for BBAM through 2025 and comes with the option to add new conversion slots every year starting in 2026.

BBAM, which manages leases for investors that own aircraft, has already converted and redelivered two A321 converted freighters to Titan Airways, a U.K. charter airline, for a total of 20 orders so far.

BBAM spokesman Matt Dallas said two of the reconfigured freighters will be leased to Lufthansa Cargo. The Lufthansa cargo subsidiary last month said it plans to add two A321s to its all-cargo fleet and outsource the flying to regional passenger carrier Lufthansa Cityline, a sister company, but did not disclose where it was acquiring the aircraft. Lufthansa expects the freighters to enter service in early 2022.

The feedstock for conversions will come from BBAM's portfolio, which totals more than 500 aircraft.

Demand for all-cargo aircraft has never been more intense, with global cargo capacity down more than 12% from pre-pandemic levels and shipping volumes at near-record levels. Nearly every airworthy freighter has been put to use in the past 18 months, and more airlift will be slow to materialize because modifying aircraft takes several months each and conversion shops are booked up. Last week, Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) said it placed deposits with engineering outfits to secure 67 conversion slots over the next 3 1/2 years for three different aircraft types.

Story continues

BBAM is taking a diversified approach to investment in converted narrowbody freighters, with 31 orders and commitments so far with Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) for converted 737-800 freighters. In July, the leasing company added a dozen aircraft to its original order.

""Our commitment to the P2F program demonstrates our confidence in the ability of EFW and ST Engineering to deliver long-term value enhancement for the A320s and A321s in our fleet,"" said BBAM President and CEO Steve Zissis in a statement. ""We have committed to the A320/A321P2F program well into the future — beyond 2026 — because we see it as a greener and highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and an excellent way to drive value for our investors.""

EFW said many of the conversions for BBAM will be carried out at ST Engineering's airframe facility in the U.S. The company previously said that ST Engineering will be adding an A321 conversion line at its VT Mobile Aerospace facility in Mobile, Alabama.

EFW was the first out of the blocks to introduce a design for modifying the A321 to carry cargo containers and pallets on the main deck. The first plane was delivered last October to Qantas to support Australia Post. Prior to the new BBAM order, EFW had logged about 17 orders from leasing companies for the A321 passenger-to-freighter conversion.

321 Precision Conversions, a U.S. joint venture between Portland, Oregon-based Precision Aircraft Solutions and ATSG, earlier this year delivered its first A321 converted freighter to a European customer and recently began retrofitting aircraft based on recent design approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Another competitor, Nanchang, China-based Sine Draco Aviation Development Ltd., is also preparing its first prototype of the A321 in all-cargo configuration.

Turning used planes into freighters is a complex undertaking that requires specialized repair shops to make structural changes, including cutting a large opening in the fuselage for a cargo door, stripping out seats, reinforcing the floor to support heavy loads, installing a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit from shifting freight and covering windows.

Although Boeing has a three- to four-year head start in the midsize freighter category for conversions, aviation experts say the A321 is likely to prove a worthy competitor because of a design that allows containers — not just breakbulk cargo — to be carried in the lower deck. The large payload, plus fuel efficiency and long-range, provide operators a high degree of operational flexibility. The A321 freighter has a payload of about 61,800 pounds and a range of more than 2,300 nautical miles.

It also is considered an excellent replacement candidate for aging Boeing 757 converted freighters.

Uh Oh: Qatar Airways Grounds 13 Airbus A350s - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1ncm91bmRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways will be grounding around one-quarter of its Airbus A350 fleet, and it looks like this could last for quite a while.

Qatar Airways’ A350 fuselage issues

For several months now, Qatar Airways has been having issues with its A350 fleet. The airline has been noticing a “significant condition” across the A350 fleet, whereby “the fuselage surface below the paint is degrading at an accelerated rate.” A couple of months back, Qatar Airways revealed that it would stop taking delivery of A350s from Airbus until the underlying problem was identified and fixed. As I’ll explain below, the airline is now taking this a step further.

As Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker describes this issue:

“With this latest development, we sincerely expect that Airbus treats this matter with the proper attention that it requires. Qatar Airways will not accept anything other than aircraft that continue to offer its customers the highest possible standard of safety and the best travel experience that they deserve. Qatar Airways expects Airbus to have established the root cause and permanently corrected the underlying condition to the satisfaction of Qatar Airways and our regulator before we take delivery of any further A350 aircraft.”

Qatar Airways was the launch customer for both the Airbus A350-900 and A350-1000, and has the second largest A350 fleet in the world (Singapore Airlines is the largest operator of the A350). The airline currently has 53 of these planes in its fleet, and has a further 23 on order.

Qatar Airways was the launch customer of the A350

Qatar Airways now grounding some A350s

While Qatar Airways had already stopped accepting delivery of new A350s, the airline is now taking its response to the next level. Qatar Airways will be grounding 13 of its Airbus A350 aircraft due to these issues.

It’s stated that this development follows “explicit written instructions” of Qatar Airways’ regulator requiring that these planes be grounded to ensure the continued safety of all passengers.

These planes have been grounded effective immediately, and will only return to service once the root cause has been established, and a satisfactory solution has been made available to permanently correct the underlying issue. This doesn’t sound to me like an overnight fix, so I would expect these planes to be parked for a while.

Qatar Airways A350-1000 Qsuites business class cabin

Throughout the pandemic, Qatar Airways has used its fuel efficient A350 fleet as the backbone of long haul operations, flying nearly all of these planes around the globe. As you might expect, grounding about one-quarter of these planes will have major operational impacts.

Qatar Airways is returning its A330 fleet into service with immediate effect (the fleet was in the process of being phased out), to offset some of the impact of the grounded A350 fleet. The airline is also currently looking for other solutions (could we maybe see the A380 fleet reactivated soon?!).

A330s likely won’t be operating any ultra long haul flights. So chances are that Qatar Airways will prioritize ultra long haul routes for A350s and 777s, and then you’re more likely to see A330s operating regional routes. So if you are flying Qatar Airways in the coming days and weeks, keep an eye on possible aircraft swaps.

Qatar Airways is reactivating more A330s

Bottom line

Qatar Airways has been experiencing issues with the fuselage surface below the paint degrading at an accelerated rate on A350 aircraft. The airline initially started by not accepting any new deliveries from Airbus anymore, and the airline is now grounding about one-quarter of its A350 fleet, allegedly at the instruction of regulators.

I’m curious to see how this plays out — it doesn’t sound like this problem will be solved anytime soon. Interestingly Qatar Airways seems to be the only airline so far reporting these issues.

Airbus has stiff sales target for A350 freighter as it aims for MD-11F replacement: analyst - Flightglobal,"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FpcmZyYW1lcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1zdGlmZi1zYWxlcy10YXJnZXQtZm9yLWEzNTAtZnJlaWdodGVyLWFzLWl0LWFpbXMtZm9yLW1kLTExZi1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1hbmFseXN0LzE0NTE2Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will need to sell at least 150 examples of its A350 freighter for the programme to be considered a success, according to a leading analyst.

Jonathan McDonald, head analyst at consultancy IBA Group, says that sales of 150-200 units would mark a good return for the proposed freighter derivative.

Airbus last month announced that it had obtained board approval to launch the A350F, which will be substantially based on the -1000 variant and have a payload of around 90t.

McDonald says the airframer is “clearly targeting the heavy widebody sector” which is “pretty Boeing dominated” at present, thanks to its 777F and 747-8F programmes.

Launch of the A350F is effectively an admission by Airbus that it is “a little bit under-represented in the heavy freighter market”, he adds.

A payload of 90t would put it “slap-dab in MD-11F territory”, says McDonald. There are 104 examples of the legacy McDonnell Douglas type still in service, with a further six examples parked, according to IBA InsightIQ data; the majority are operated by FedEx and UPS.

Securing orders from the two logistics giants will be key for the new programme, he says. However, Airbus will need to do more than replace MD-11Fs to hit the 150-sales mark and could also target operators of ageing 747-400 freighters. IBA InsightIQ data shows there are 194 examples, both factory built and conversions, still in operation, plus another 13 parked aircraft.

While the maximum payload of the -400F is higher, at 113t, with the termination of the 747-8F programme next year, Airbus could still take advantage of a replacement need.

And should Airbus deliver the A350F by 2025 as planned, then it will at least have first-mover advantage over Boeing, which has yet to decide whether to offer a freighter variant of its developmental 777X.

In McDonald’s view a 777-8F is unlikely to arrive much before 2028, giving its rival a three-year head-start.

“Airbus has seen a little bit of a gap there and it believes it can leapfrog Boeing with a new technology aircraft,” he says.

Boeing still holds 52 orders for the current -200LR-based 777F, according to the airframer’s data, and is likely to continue production in parallel with the first passenger 777-9s.

To date, it has handed over 209 examples of the widebody freighter since first delivery in 2009, its data shows.

In contrast, Airbus earlier this year cancelled the three outstanding orders for its only factory-built freighter programme, the A330-200F. It has delivered just 38 examples of the widebody cargo variant.

Airbus is also banking on the fuel efficiency of the A350F to see off any potential competition from the 777-300ERSF conversion programme being developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and lessor GECAS.

While McDonald considers the IAI/GECAS conversion will deliver a “hell of an aircraft” he notes that “you have got to remember that when those aircraft [re-enter service] some of those earliest aircraft will be 19-20 years old”.

And although the 777’s GE90-115BL is a “great engine” it is now “technically superseded by the Trent XWB” on the A350, he says. Therefore “Airbus is counting on the better fuel efficiency” of its new-build freighter to be a key differentiator for certain operators.

For others, however, a list price likely to be three times higher than that of a converted 777 could be too steep.

That view is supported by IAI Aviation Group general manager Yossi Melamed, who shrugs off threat from the A350F. “In our eyes, conversion eyes, we don’t see a [new-build] freighter as a competitor,” he says, adding that such aircraft tend to be acquired by companies “which have a philosophy” of using new-build aircraft. “I’m not in this game.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6807386875152588}",neutral,0.6807386875152588,0
Airbus wins another 30-aircraft order from Delta Air Lines - Aerospace Manufacturing,"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm8tbWFnLmNvbS9haXJidXMtZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLTI1MDgyMDIx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines has ordered 30 Airbus A321neo aircraft to help meet its future fleet requirements.

The newly-ordered aircraft are in addition to the airline’s existing orders for 125 of the type, bringing the outstanding orders from Delta to a total of 155 A321neos.

“Adding these aircraft strengthens Delta’s commitment to replacing older fleets with more sustainable, efficient jets, and offering the best customer experience in the industry,” said Mahendra Nair, Delta’s senior vice president – fleet and techops supply chain. “Delta appreciates the extensive partnership with the Airbus team in support of our strategic growth plans, and we look forward to continuing to work together throughout the recovery and beyond.”

“As the industry looks to emerge from the pandemic, Delta is showing responsible leadership and casting a strong vote of confidence now in the A321neo,” added Christian Scherer, chief commercial officer and head of Airbus International. “With orders for 30 more of an aircraft that is in very high demand around the globe, our partners at Delta are underscoring the strategic role they see for the A321neo with its outstanding environmental performance for the airline’s renowned customer service and reliability for years into the future.”

Delta’s A321neos will be powered by next-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines that bring significant efficiency gains over Delta’s current, already-efficient A321 aircraft.

The airline is slated to receive the first of its 155 A321neo aircraft early next year.

Many of Delta’s A321neos will be delivered from the Airbus US manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama. The airline has taken delivery of 87 US-made Airbus aircraft since 2016.

As of the end of July, Delta’s fleet of Airbus aircraft numbered 358, including 50 A220 aircraft, 240 A320 Family members, 53 A330 widebodies, and 15 A350 XWB aircraft.

Airbus sent this PR:

Delta Air Lines has ordered 30 additional Airbus A321neo aircraft to help meet the airline’s future fleet requirements. The newly-ordered aircraft are in addition to the airline’s existing orders for 125 of the type, bringing the outstanding orders from Delta to a total of 155 A321neos.

“Adding these aircraft strengthens Delta’s commitment to replacing older fleets with more sustainable, efficient jets, and offering the best customer experience in the industry,” said Mahendra Nair, Delta’s Senior Vice President – Fleet and TechOps Supply Chain. “Delta appreciates the extensive partnership with the Airbus team in support of our strategic growth plans, and we look forward to continuing to work together throughout the recovery and beyond.”

Delta’s A321neos will be powered by next-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines that bring significant efficiency gains over Delta’s current, already-efficient A321 aircraft. Equipped with total seating for 194 customers with 20 in First Class, 42 in Delta Comfort+ and 132 in the Main Cabin, Delta’s A321neos will be deployed primarily across the airline’s extensive domestic network, complementing Delta’s current A321 fleet of more than 120 aircraft. The airline is slated to receive the first of its 155 A321neo aircraft early next year.

Many of Delta’s A321neos will be delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. The airline has taken delivery of 87 U.S.-manufactured Airbus aircraft since 2016.

Our take:

This isn’t a big order yet is more significant than it appears. The decision shows Delta building its middle-of-market (MoM) fleet and the focus is on the A321. Keep in mind that Delta already ordered 25 A321neo’s in April and backfilled its options with another 25.

This suggests that the MoM is growing in importance – even Boeing loyalist United has ordered the A321. The gap Boeing left in the market is being closed by Airbus. As US airlines upsize Airbus is winning and, since this is not a zero-sum game, Boeing is losing.

The Delta move means American and United will also adjust their fleets – game theory makes that necessary. Any advantage must be minimized. Do you think Delta’s selection makes the MAX 10 more attractive?

Airbus moves further down the long-term cost curve; economies of scale are like physics. What does Boeing have to do to its MAX pricing to compete? What is the cost to Boeing?

Another winner here is Pratt & Whitney. Who doesn’t want Delta as a customer? Note that Delta is not doing an IndiGo move on engines.

As we emerge from the pandemic, smaller aircraft with long-range like the A321neo is becoming the tool of choice. Witness JetBlue’s new London service. Delta has ensured it will stay near the front of the delivery line of the aircraft airlines want.

This isn’t just another 30 A321neo we are talking about here.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999998927116394}",positive,0.999998927116394,1
