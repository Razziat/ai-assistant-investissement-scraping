Airbus Alabama production launch to boost aerospace sector | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTUvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWFsYWJhbWEtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1sYXVuY2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“This a great day for Mobile and a great day for our great state of Alabama,” Governor Robert Bentley said at the ceremony.

‘NEW DIMENSION’

“I can’t wait to see the next chapter of the Mobile Airbus story.”

Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said the long-range impact of the Airbus manufacturing facility in Mobile will be significant on several levels. (He made his comments before departing for a Commerce-led trade mission to South Africa .)

“With Airbus’ production launch, Mobile now enjoys an elite status as one of only three locations in the nation where large passenger jets are assembled, and that positions its aerospace cluster for additional investment and jobs.” Secretary Canfield said. “In addition, having Airbus’ only U.S. manufacturing facility in Alabama provides a boost for the state’s overall economic development efforts.

“It’s also worth noting that the Airbus facility brings a major new dimension to Alabama’s aerospace sector — aircraft assembly,” he added. “We’re already involved in component manufacturing, research and design, advanced materials, training, and rocket and missile production. Aircraft assembly will elevate Alabama’s prominence in the growing global aerospace sector.”

Tom Enders, CEO of the Airbus Group, said the European company has long-standing ties to Mobile and Alabama. Airbus opened an engineering center at the Aeroplex nearly a decade ago. In addition, the company partnered with Alabama to launch an ultimately unsuccessful bid to build U.S. Air Force refueling tankers in Mobile.

“I can’t wait to see the next chapter of the Mobile Airbus story,” Enders said at the ceremony.

The U.S. is the largest market for single-aisle passenger jets, which includes the Boeing 737 along with the A320 Family. Airbus has delivered 6,700 A320 Family aircraft since the plane debuted in 1988. The company has a backlog of A320 Family orders numbering almost 5,500.

The first Alabama-made Airbus aircraft – an A321ceo – will be delivered to JetBlue Airways next year at the Aeroplex. Assembly of a second A321 is also under way at the Alabama plant.

Airbus also assembles A320 aircraft in Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; and Tianjin, China.

“Today is a moment of pride for all Airbus people everywhere,” Brégier said.

WELCOMING AIRBUS

Alabama officials gave Airbus a warm welcome. U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions told guests at the grand opening ceremony that the facility at the Aeroplex will become a center of international aircraft manufacturing. U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne lauded the Airbus Alabama production launch.

“This ribbon cutting is a milestone event that is particularly significant to the Mobile community,” said Bill Sisson, president of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce. “Although Airbus has been a part of the business community for almost a decade, the manufacturing facility is a monumental accomplishment. It will have impact for generations to come.”

Lt. Governor Kay Ivey said the Airbus facility fits in nicely with Alabama’s rich history of aviation and aerospace, which dates back more than a century to when the Wright Brothers opened the nation’s first civilian flight school in Montgomery.

“Airbus is a valued partner and friend to Alabama,” she said. “As lieutenant governor and chair of the Aerospace States Association, I am thrilled to mark this special occasion and continuation of our development and advancement in the aerospace industry.”"

How China is playing Boeing against Airbus to build its own airplane industry - Vox.com,"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNS85LzI0LzkzODk3NjcvYm9laW5nLWNoaW5hLWRlYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the first time ever, Boeing is locating an aircraft production facility abroad — in China — as part of a bundled deal to sell 300 new planes to Chinese airlines and leasing companies. Companies moving production to China is an old story, of course, but Boeing isn't just new to the Chinese market — this is the first time it's ever built a factory abroad. That makes it a huge deal in the deeply politicized aviation industry, and many smell a link to the demise of the Export-Import Bank, since Boeing was the biggest beneficiary of its largesse.

But this is also a story about Chinese public policy, and it highlights at least one respect in which the country's state-dominated economic growth model (whatever its other flaws) works better than freer markets — the country can coherently pursue multi-pronged efforts to develop new domestic industries by leveraging the scale of its domestic consumer market. The Chinese want to develop a domestic airplane manufacturing industry. But building large airplanes is difficult. So they've been playing Boeing and its major competitor off each other to get both companies to help teach a Chinese company how to do it. Lenin famously said that ""the capitalists will sell us the rope we use to hang them,"" and while neither company really wants to help create a new rival, neither is willing to cede control over the Chinese market to the other.

Boeing scored a huge sale to the Chinese government

In total, the planes Boeing has agreed to sell are worth about $38 billion — an enormous sum of money. That's spread across three separate airlines and an aircraft leasing company, but all three airlines are state-owned enterprises, and the leasing company is a subsidiary of a bank that's also state-owned.

The deal, in other words, is entirely controlled by the Chinese government, which, of course, wants a good deal on quality airplanes but also has a larger set of policy objectives.

Boeing is opening a Chinese factory to catch up to Airbus

In the United States, privately owned airlines choose to buy large aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus, Boeing's European rival, based on a relatively narrow set of business considerations. But while the Chinese government isn't indifferent to the quality of a plane purchasing deal qua deal, it also looks at other political factors.

In recent years the bulk of Chinese aircraft purchases have come from Airbus. Not coincidentally, Airbus has a production facility in Tianjin and is opening a second Chinese factory. Boeing is now opening its own Chinese factory in part to play catch-up — and the announcement is deliberately paired with the announcement of the new sales. The message from the Chinese government to both companies is clear: Your ability to make sales in China is going to be based in part on your willingness to locate factories in China.

China is trying to learn how to make airplanes

Labor unions representing Boeing's workforce are, naturally, concerned about the impact of the new facility on jobs for their members. But China's leaders are really after something much bigger than a factory full of jobs. They are trying to develop a domestic aviation industry. And to do that, they need workers and managers who know how to build airplanes.

That's why the Chinese government's state-owned aerospace company has launched a subsidiary called the Commercial Aviation Company of China (Comec) with a mandate to build first the C919, a narrow-body aircraft intended to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus's 320, and then with a longer-term ambition to build wide-body airplanes.

The plant Boeing is going to build in China will be used to put the finishing touches on 737s and will handle the delivery and servicing of the aircraft. It's also going to be a joint venture between Boeing and Comec. In other words, Boeing is going to be training Comec personnel in the skills they need to complete the C919 — an airplane that is designed to put Boeing out of business.

China is playing Airbus and Boeing off each other

How could Boeing be so careless about its own long-term business interests? Well, in part it's because Boeing's executives need to care about the company's short-term revenue and profits, and the quarterly earnings reports don't care about Comec's long-term vision.

But in part it's because Boeing believes that Comec is going to master this craft one way or the other. After all, remember that Airbus plant in Tianjin? It's also a joint venture with Comec. So from Boeing's perspective the die has already been cast, and it would be foolish to let Airbus gobble up the entire Chinese market for itself.

Meanwhile, Airbus is probably telling itself that helping the Chinese learn how to do final assembly for the A320 probably isn't that big of a deal because there are a lot of other steps in the aircraft value chain and a lot of bigger, more complicated planes out there. But that's why getting Boeing into the China game is important. Boeing's new Chinese plant is going to be doing basically the same things as Airbus's existing one. So if Airbus wants to regain the upper hand in competition for sales to the giant Chinese market, it will likely have to step up its future Chinese production.

Loss of Export-Import Bank subsidies plays an indirect role

Lurking in the background of this story is the Export-Import Bank, a longstanding scheme to provide discounted loans to American manufacturers that vanished early this summer after sustained attacks from Tea Party Republicans. As the American economy has shifted away from manufacturing over the decades, airplanes have become a very large share of American manufacturing exports, and Boeing became the single biggest recipient of Export-Import Bank loans. On an elite level, the main source of lobbying against the bank was Delta, an airline that didn't like the idea of the US government subsidizing airline purchases for its foreign competitors.*

The bank's disappearance will somewhat disadvantage Boeing in competition with Airbus for future contracts, because Europe retains its export financing subsidies. It also moderately reduces financial incentives for Boeing to keep its production in the United States.

But the main relevance is political. The aerospace industry is highly politicized, due to both the heavy government role in regulating the airline industry and the linkages between commercial aircraft production and military aircraft production. Boeing's main competitor, Airbus, is partly owned by European governments, and its Chinese frenemy Comec is owned by the Chinese government. Government ownership isn't really done in America, but the Export-Import Bank — along with defense contracts — was one of the US government's main tools for supporting and influencing Boeing. With it gone, Boeing is more cut loose and more inclined to cut deals that advance China's long-term industrial aspirations rather than America's.

* Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Delta mostly flies Airbus planes. Delta does have a fleet of Airbus equipment inherited from its takeover of the former Northwest Airlines but a majority of its planes are made by Boeing."
Airbus Perlan Mission II - Airbus,"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNS0wOS1haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLW1pc3Npb24taWnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 23 September 2015 – The Perlan 2 glider, the world’s first engineless aircraft designed to reach the edge of space, achieved its successful first flight today in a historic moment about 5,000 feet above Roberts Field, the Redmond Municipal Airport in Oregon.

This was the first test flight of the aircraft, which next year will attempt to set a new world altitude record for any airplane. The goal of this project is to open up a world of new discoveries related to high-altitude flight, climate change and space exploration.

“Airbus Perlan Mission II is a historic endeavour in the truest spirit of aviation’s earliest pioneers,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Airbus Group. “The knowledge gained from this project will impact how the world understands and addresses climate change. But it will also help Airbus continue to innovate ways to fly higher, faster and cleaner, on Earth and possibly beyond.”

The Perlan 2 glider was developed by The Perlan Project, a volunteer-run, non-profit endeavour headed by leaders in aerospace and engineering. It is supported by Airbus Group and a group of other sponsors that includes Weather Extreme Ltd., United Technologies and

BRS Aerospace.

Airbus Perlan Mission II is a historic endeavour in the truest spirit of aviation’s earliest pioneers

We’re extremely excited about the successful first flight of the Perlan 2 glider,”said Ed Warnock, CEO of the Perlan Projet. “This marks a major breakthrough in aviation innovation, one that will allow winged exploration of the atmosphere at the edge of space and lead to new discoveries to unravel some of the continuing mysteries of weather, climate change and ozone depletion.”

Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock piloted today’s flight, which was the first of many for the Airbus Perlan Mission II team as it prepares to soar the aircraft to the edge of space in Argentina in 2016. The Perlan 2 is a pressurized sailplane designed to ride air currents that, in certain mountainous regions near the north and south poles, can reach into the stratosphere. Next year’s flights are expected to reach 90,000 feet, exceeding even the altitudes achieved by the U-2 and the SR-71.

Despite having no engine, the glider’s true flight speed at that altitude will be more than 400 mph and the air density will be less than two percent of what it is at sea level. The crew will breathe pure oxygen provided by a rebreather system, similar to what astronauts use in space.

In addition to its two-person crew, the aircraft carries scientific instruments to provide new insight into climate change and our upper atmosphere. Because it lacks an engine, Perlan 2 can explore the edge of space without polluting the atmosphere it will study, opening up human knowledge on several fronts:

Understanding Weather – What happens at the highest levels of the stratosphere impacts weather around the globe, and Perlan 2 will be able to directly observe important atmospheric phenomena that previously have only been speculated about.

– What happens at the highest levels of the stratosphere impacts weather around the globe, and Perlan 2 will be able to directly observe important atmospheric phenomena that previously have only been speculated about. Predicting Climate Change – Perlan 2 will collect and share data with atmospheric scientists worldwide, to improve climate models and more accurately predict climate change and its potential solutions.

– Perlan 2 will collect and share data with atmospheric scientists worldwide, to improve climate models and more accurately predict climate change and its potential solutions. Diagnosing the Ozone Layer – Perlan 2 can take untainted air samples from the stratosphere to measure the levels of ozone-damaging chemicals and assess whether the ozone layer is replenishing or still depleting.

Airbus places focus on people at first production site in America - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDkvYWlyYnVzLXBsYWNlcy1mb2N1cy1vbi1wZW9wbGUtYXQtZmlyc3QtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1zaXRlLWluLWFtZXJpY2Ev0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE: “If we are just looking at [the cost] of people we should probably locate the assembly line in Mexico.” That is the story Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier offered up in front of the media as part of a ceremony inaugurating the airframer’s first US final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

In short, there might be cheaper places to get the work done, but there is something about being in Mobile which makes it the smart place for Airbus to do business.

Airbus needs a steady supply of employees with experience and training in manufacturing, and Mobile offers that, along with a deep water port less than five miles from the facility.

Mobile’s mayor, Sandy Stimpson, spoke to the quality of the workforce his city and the region is able to provide to Airbus. “They knew that we have a workforce here that has a history of being very productive, of being very quality-conscious,” he said.

Much of that workforce comes with a military background, including many with specific aviation experience, an advantage when it comes to integrating into the Airbus environment. Some of the approximately 200 new hires for Airbus have already been to facilities in Europe for training and their experience was well received as they were brought in to doing things the Airbus way.

The workforce integration extends well beyond the existing group already hired. Stimpson is excited by the prospects of growth for the facility and the employment prospects in his city.

Airbus could hire up to 1,000 direct employees if it expands the manufacturing to eight frames per month (four/month is planned by late 2017).

Every airplane we build this year [at #AirbusInAlabama ] will be an A321 because that's where the US market is going. -Eccleston #AvGeek — Seth Miller (@WandrMe) September 13, 2015

There is also optimism that additional aerospace-related companies will arrive and grow the Alabama aviation area. To that end Mayor Stimpson noted that Airbus and the local vocational groups are working together to ensure that a capable and competent workforce is ready to fill those jobs.

“The Alabama Industrial Development Training group is VERY engaged… They are transforming the community college to make sure to really helps to focus and train the workforce for Airbus,” he said."
Coach ‘sleeping boxes’ possible on Airbus - CNN,"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNvYWNoLXNsZWVwaW5nLWJveGVzLWZlYXQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus applies for a patent for ""sleeping boxes"" Proposed coach sleeping pods may never become a reality Airlines would need to make money with them, an expert says

CNN —

Tired of trying to sleep while stuffed into your tiny coach seat on a long-haul flight?

Coach passengers flying long distances may eventually get to rest in “sleeping boxes” proposed last week by Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturer.

The sleeping boxes would be stacked in the rear of the aircraft, according to a patent application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, first reported by the Daily Mail.

Passengers would still receive meals and would still have to buckle up during takeoff and landing.

Airline squeeze: It’s not you, “it’s the seat”

Airbus declined to comment directly on the patent application.

“Airbus applies for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property,” Airbus Americas spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn wrote in an email.

“These patents are often based on R&D concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualization, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realized technology or product.”

Aviation expert Benet J. Wilson isn’t sure the plan will fly.

“You always see aircraft manufacturers studying passenger experience amenities like a sleeping box,” said Wilson, About.com’s air travel expert. “But getting from concept to reality is a long road and most times never gets past the paper stage.

“And there are these two questions: Will airline passengers actually pay for something like this, and could the airlines make money with it? If Airbus can answer these two questions, then we are much more likely to see it someday.”

Whether the patent proposal ever becomes a reality is anyone’s guess, but Airbus did confirm one interesting detail in its application: It admitted that its coach seats “can be found by the passengers to be uncomfortable, particularly on long-haul flights.”"
Elbit Systems and Airbus Helicopters Inc. to provide H125 and H145 helicopters to Israel Police - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 09 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2VsYml0c3lzdGVtc2FuZGFpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzaW5jdG9wcm92aWRlaDEyNWFuZGgxNDVoZWxpYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Israel Police’s new H145s and H125s will replace a fleet of aging single-engine helicopters. Airbus Helicopters Inc. Image

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is pleased to announce that Elbit Systems, Ltd. has ordered six new helicopters that will be placed into service with the Israel Police. The order is for four Airbus Helicopters H125 AStars and two H145s to support Elbit’s contract to supply helicopters for the Israel Police. The new aircraft will replace Israel Police’s aging fleet of single-engine helicopters.

Israel Police is the civilian police force for Israel and conducts law enforcement, counter-terrorism, border security, search and rescue, and planning in the future to support firefighting missions throughout the country. In its requirements for replacing the current fleet of single-engine aircraft, the Israel Police specified advanced aircraft and avionics systems to have the most modern and capable replacement fleet available. Requirements included glass panel cockpit displays, engine FADEC, and modern safety features. The Airbus Helicopters aircraft will be equipped with numerous options, including thermal imagers, searchlights, moving map systems, and cargo swings for firefighting.

The Israel Police have contracted with Elbit Systems to provide financing of the six aircraft, along with full maintenance and spare parts support, to ensure high levels of availability for their demanding mission requirements. Airbus Helicopters Inc. will provide the helicopters, helicopter completion services, flight and maintenance training, and spare parts support throughout the contract term with Elbit. Delivery of the new helicopters to Elbit will begin by the end of 2016.

“Airbus Helicopters Inc. is excited to have won this contract to replace the Israel Police helicopter fleet,” said Sebastien Delmaire, vice president of strategy and business development. “The delivery of these aircraft will mark the introduction of the H125 and H145 to Israel. The H125s will be the first built for a foreign customer on the Airbus Helicopters Inc. final assembly line in Columbus, Miss.”

“Airbus Helicopters Inc. looks forward to working with Elbit Systems and the Israel Police on this project, and for many years to come,” said Ed Van Winkle, sales manager for airborne law enforcement. “In addition to providing the highest performing aircraft, Airbus Helicopters has strong expertise and a solid reputation worldwide for supporting law enforcement agencies and their missions. The H125 is the Airborne Law Enforcement market leader in the United States while the H145 is among the leading models in Europe.”

The H125 is the latest version of the AStar family, which has become the most popular single-engine helicopter in the law enforcement community. The AStar is a high performance and highly reliable helicopter with multi-mission flexibility, and the H125 brings next-generation performance to the family. The aircraft is powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine that delivers a higher cruise speed and is equipped with a dual-channel FADEC and Engine Data Recorder, which enhance safety and systems management.

The H145 is the next-generation version of the proven BK117 family. The H145 is equipped with new dual channel FADEC engines and an upgraded main gearbox, providing an unprecedented level of one-engine inoperative (OEI) performance, along with superior hover and hot and high performance. The H145’s new Helionix cockpit displays reduce pilot workload and enhance situational awareness, which increase safety margins during challenging missions. The Fenestron tail rotor system ensures safety on the ground and lower noise levels in-flight. The large cabin provides flexibility for surveillance missions, tactical team deployments, and search-and-rescue operations."
Airbus offers sneak-peek inside Alabama A320 factory - Flightglobal,"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9mZmVycy1zbmVhay1wZWVrLWluc2lkZS1hbGFiYW1hLWEzMjAtZmFjdG9yeS8xMTgxNjkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus opened the $600 million final assembly and delivery center for the A320 aircraft family in Mobile, Alabama, to the international press for the first time on 13 September.

Although videos and photos are forbidden to be released until a public grand opening scheduled early on 14 September, a 90-minute tour revealed an almost exact copy of the company’s 'Hangar 9' final assembly hall in Hamburg, Germany, with still plenty of room to grow well beyond the plan to reach four aircraft deliveries per month from Mobile by the end of 2017.

“It signifies that Airbus is already a US manufacturer,” says Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier, speaking in a downtown Mobile hotel on a panel of company executives to reporters after the tour.

Two shipsets of A320 assemblies have already arrived in Mobile since June, filling two of the four stations in the final assembly. The first aircraft in assembly, a JetBlue A321, is approaching the Station 40 wing-to-body join within two weeks. The fuselage for an American Airlines A321 is sitting behind in Station 41. Both aircraft could fly in the first quarter of 2016, followed by deliveries beginning in the second quarter of next year.

Airbus

The production system is identical to the process used at the other three A320 assembly sites with one key change. Airbus is qualifying an automated drilling machine at wing-to-body join position, replacing a manual process to drill about 2,400 holes where the sections meet. If the automated system works, Airbus plans to retrofit the other A320 assembly lines with the same technology.

By the end of 2017, Airbus expects to reach the planned production rate of four aircraft per month, supplying hungry demand from US carriers for the twin-engined narrowbody and contributing a critical piece of a plan to achieve a monthly production rate of 50 aircraft.

Whether the Mobile site continues to grow beyond that point is still open to question, as a debate forms between Airbus executives in Europe and the USA.

There is no question that the Mobile site has the capacity to continue growing. With relatively minimal capital investment, such as adding shifts and building a new paint hangar, Airbus could double the capacity of the existing facility. Even the Honeywell-built power plant for the Mobile site is sized to support a monthly production rate of eight aircraft per month.

In Europe, however, Airbus executives are considering increasing the overall production rate of A320s to up to 60 aircraft per month after 2017. If such a ramp-up is needed to be achieved rapidly, Bregier says the quickest option is to create a new assembly line in Hamburg, negating the need to expand capacity in Mobile.

But Alan McArtor, chief executive of the US-based Airbus Inc., said in a separate interview that he disagrees that Hamburg would be the preferred option if a rapid ramp-up is necessary.

“I don’t know that that’s necessarily true,” McArtor says.

In theory, it would also be possible to increase A320 capacity beyond four aircraft deliveries a month in Mobile by decreasing capacity elsewhere.

Asked if such an option would be considered, however, Bregier was clearly uninterested. “Why would we do that?” he asked. The Mobile site was created to contribute to the production ramp-up, not offset capacity already in the system, he adds.

The grand opening of the Mobile line completes a 13-year saga with many twists and turns for Airbus. The south Alabama port was originally selected to house a completion centre for Airbus A330 aerial tankers, if the aircraft was selected by the US Air Force for the KC-X contract. Airbus also proposed to build commercial A330 freighters at the site, but those plans ended when Boeing the KC-X contract in 2011.

But then Airbus’ needs suddenly changed. The launch of the A320neo in 2010 and a five-year wave of commercial narrowbody orders drove Airbus to consider alternate production sites, with Tianjin and Mobile selected to supplement capacity in Hamburg and Toulouse, France.

Adjacent to a deepwater port and a seldom-used, 10,000ft (3,048m) runway, Mobile’s sparsely occupied Brookley Aeroplex always appeared attractive to Airbus. In addition to the current facility sprawling over 160 acres, Airbus also leases another equally-sized plot of undeveloped land on the size to accommodate future growth.

“Mobile is our industrial home,” McArtor says. “We have enough real estate under lease with the Mobile airport authority to expand. We have no direct plans. It certainly is a capability we can do in the future. It is not likely at all that we would try to find some other state to go to. This is our home right here.”

""I have filmed lots of crosswind landings within the past four years but this was the first time I was able to film an A380 crosswind Landing,"" Cargospotter says in the YouTube post. ""All crosswind Landings are amazing but seeing an A380 fighting against the wind was something special. In addition to that the runway was very wet and the A380 touched down a little late.""

While the video may look dramatic, commercial aircraft are capable of making such landings. Similarly, pilots are trained to land in all types of conditions – including in strong crosswinds.

While landing in these conditions may feel a bit ""bumpy"" to those onboard, it's a relatively common occurrence that happens daily at airports across the globe. YouTube alone boasts more than 200,000 uploads showing planes of all sizes making wobbly-looking landings amid crosswinds.

In some cases, pilots opt to go around for another landing. And extreme crosswinds can pose a safety risk, though pilots are trained to recognize those situations. Typically, though, most crosswind landings end up as nearly routine events -- a testament to safety advances of commercial aircraft and the training required of commercial pilots.

""Landing in a strong, gusty crosswind is challenging. This skill is one that all professional pilots must master early in their careers,"" USA TODAY Ask the Captain columnist John Cox says. ""Every airplane has a crosswind limit that pilots respect. Judgment is essential to determine when the conditions are too severe to safely land. It can be difficult, but good judgment keeps it from being dangerous.""

Airbus is Fighting Boeing on Home Soil with New U.S. Factory - Fortune,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS8xNC9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWZhY3RvcnktdXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French plane manufacturer Airbus (EADSY) will unveil a $600 million factory in Alabama, setting itself up for a dogfight with Boeing (BA) on its home soil.

Its new plant in Mobile for single-aisle airplanes is part of a strategy to increase Airbus’ share of the U.S. market from 20% to 50%. The facility is just the second one built outside of Europe, and deliveries to carriers like American Airlines – operator of the largest Airbus fleet in the world – could knock market share up to 40% in no time.

“Our first U.S. facility has been years in the making,” Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier said, as reported by Bloomberg. “It is the most significant, game-changing incident in U.S. aerospace in years.”

The first two single-aisle jets, bound for JetBlue and American, will be made in Mobile, and the factory will serve as a manufacturing hub for North American customers, Airbus said.

It’s a big move in a market traditionally favoring the Chicago-based Boeing, and a big reason is the competitive backlog of orders for narrowbody jets, the backbone of many carriers. Backlogged orders currently number at 5,181 for Airbus to 4,253 for Boeing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Both planemakers are engaged in a fierce race for jetliner orders, resulting in a near-record pace of orders in an industry that has seen delivery delays. Last year, according to the Wall Street Journal, Airbus beat Boeing in new orders for 2014, although it delivered fewer aircraft than its rival. The chart below shows the competitive history between both companies:"
Airbus milestone: China Eastern takes delivery of its 50th A330 - USA TODAY,"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE1LzA5LzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1taWxlc3RvbmUtY2hpbmEtZWFzdGVybi10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1pdHMtNTB0aC1hMzMwLzcyNzI2NzE2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus milestone: China Eastern takes delivery of its 50th A330

China Eastern Airlines took delivery of its 50th Airbus A330 jet last week in a ceremony in Toulouse, France.

""We are very happy to take delivery of this 50th A330. It symbolically represents our 30 years of partnership with Airbus,"" Ma Xulun, China Eastern's General Manager, said in a statement about the Friday event. ""With high efficiency, high economic performance and unrivaled comfort, the A330 gives our passengers an unrivaled flying experience.""

The Shanghai-based carrier operates one of the world's largest fleets of the popular wide-body jet. China Eastern took delivery of its first A330 in 2006.

The airline serves four destinations in North America plus Hawaii. Thanks to a recent tie-up with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, that number is expected to rise in the next few years.

Airbus' milestone number for the A330 with China Eastern mirrors the rising success that the European airplane maker has had with its A330 in recent years. Once considered to have had its best days in the past, the type has seen a resurgence in sales in the past decade.

Over 1,200 A330s have been delivered to date, according to Airbus, with another 1,500 on order.

The A330's improved prospects prompted Airbus to launch a revamped version of the jet in 2014. The update features new wings and other components. Dubbed the A330neo, the jet is aimed at competing with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777 programs. It is slated to take its first flight in 2017."
Airbus Mobile FAL a victory for CEO Enders - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS8xNC9haXJidXMtbW9iaWxlLWZhbC1hLXZpY3RvcnktZm9yLWNlby1lbmRlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sept. 14, 2015, © Leeham Co., Mobile (AL): The opening of the Airbus Mobile (AL) A320 Final Assembly Line (FAL) is viewed by some close associates as a personal victory for Tom Enders, the chief executive officer of Airbus Group.

Enders began the quest of a US FAL 10 years ago, when EADS (then the name of Airbus’ parent, now Air Group) joined with Northrop Grumman to bid on the US Air Force Refueling Tanker, the KC-X. The Boeing Co. was the competition, and supplied tankers to the USAF since the end of World War II.

But Boeing’s last KC-135 was delivered in 1966. The KC-767 International program, for Japan and Italy, was an industrial fiasco. Airbus was new to the game with its KC-330, then an untested program. EADS promised to build the tanker in Mobile, so it could claim it was US-assembled and created US jobs.

The idea that Airbus could supply the USAF with tankers instead of Boeing was heretical. The competition was bitter and prolonged. Everyone was stunned when the Air Force selected the KC-330, including EADS and Northrop.

But the USAF mucked up the process. The contract was rebid and this time, Boeing won. Enders’ dream of a US facility seemed dead.

But it wasn’t. Within a year, Alabama officials and Airbus regrouped and announced the plant would be recast as an FAL for the A320 Family.

By this time, Enders had become CEO of EADS and Fabrice Bregier CEO of Airbus. Together they pursued the dream. Some believed there was peril in this pursuit for Enders, and to a lesser degree, Bregier. The political meddling of the French and German governments in Airbus strategy, driven by employment and work-share, was well known. So was the influence of unions, ever-concerned about job loss. (Some of the more militant unions objected to the idea of the tanker being assembled in Mobile, ignoring the long-term implications of landing an important defense contract with the US military.)

Enders, in an interview yesterday with Leeham News and Comment, shrugged off the political and labor concerns.

“Actually, when we first took the decision and communicated with the politicians and labor unions, I don’t think it was as difficult as you seem to imply. We have China as an example. The China example shows we were able to significantly increase our market share of China through this investment. At the same time we created additional jobs in Europe,” Enders said.

“This is a growth industry, a growing industry, and we have kind of a thumb rule that one employee here trickles something like three additional employees in Europe. That’s a win-win for both sides. This was not difficult politically. This was a real strategic decision in the sense it cannot be wrong to be industrially stronger to be present in the world’s largest aerospace market. This was driving us, plus the fact that the US is the world’s largest single aisle market.”

When the decision was made to create an FAL in Mobile, Airbus had a single-aisle market share in the US of 19%. “We thought we should bring that up.”

Enders conceded that a US FAL in and of itself won’t drive a purchase decision, but all other things being equal, the ability of Airbus now offering an aircraft assembled in America by American workers provides a “psychological” factor.

“There can be some advantage of having aircraft delivered out of Mobile rather than Hamburg, Germany, or Toulouse, France,” he said.

Enders sees the A320 FAL as a key to potential future defense business with the US, noting the Mobile facility was intended to start with the tanker and then expand with a commercial site. Now, Enders sees the reverse: commercial first, followed by a military facility.

“We were always struggling with our credibility with the US military because we had no plant yet. Our credibility [now] is far bigger because we have a solid production going in the United States.”

Airbus Enlarges A400M Facilities in Spain - Defense News,"Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNS8wOS8wMi9haXJidXMtZW5sYXJnZXMtYTQwMG0tZmFjaWxpdGllcy1pbi1zcGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID — Airbus Defence and Space has increased its facilities for the A400M military transport plane in Seville after renting a new hangar to update and maintain aircraft in service. A French Air Force A400M is already being modernized there.

The new hangar, owned by Greenmark S.L., is located next to the A400M final assembly line in Seville and has 6,000 square meters of working area. Airbus DS will have an extra 11,000 square meters handed over by the Spanish Air Force. The agreement is valid until 2022, the European manufacturer reported.

This announcement comes four months after the crash of an Airbus A400M during a test flight in Seville, killing four of the six people on board and seriously injuring the other two.

The production plan for this year is under review following that accident. However, Airbus DS is still targeting at least 13 aircraft in 2015. The UK Royal Air Force will be the next client to receive an A400M.

Five national air forces include the aircraft in their fleets: France (6), United Kingdom (2), Turkey (2), Germany (1) and Malaysia (1).

The first A400M was delivered in 2013. A total of 174 have been ordered, but the company has been having difficulties meeting its delivery schedule, prompting Airbus to shake up its management program in January.

Airbus DS is moving the headquarters of the A400M program from Toulouse, France, to Seville, a change that will involve the arrival of 100 extra engineers in Seville.

"Airbus, UK MoD Deny Deal To Purchase Zephyr UAV - Defense News","Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNS8wOS8xMC9haXJidXMtdWstbW9kLWRlbnktZGVhbC10by1wdXJjaGFzZS16ZXBoeXItdWF2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Less than 24 hours after an Airbus Defence and Space executive briefed reporters here that the company had a deal with the British Ministry of Defence to supply three solar-powered surveillance UAVs capable of flying at the edge of space, both sides were denying any such agreement existed.

Veteran executive Steve Whitby, the lead business development executive on the Zephyr solar-powered UAV program, said Wednesday that the Defence Ministry was purchasing the first three of a new variant of the machine, known as the Zephyr 8. He said final negotiations were underway and later said a memorandum of understanding was in place.

Defense News reported Wednesday that a sale was in place subject to final negotiations. Now, however, both sides are saying Whitby got ahead of himself, and no deal exists at this time for what Airbus calls a high-altitude pseudo satellite.

""The situation is that no decisions have been taken as to whether the MoD is intending to investigate the military utility of High-Altitude Pseudo Satellites,"" a spokesman for the MoD said.

The spokesman said there was no memorandum of understanding in place.

The Defence Ministry was asked for a statement ahead of the story being published but was unable to respond in time.

""We would like to clarify our position following the recent media briefing: We have ambitions, and are expecting to secure contracts for Zephyr in the near future. But no contracts are in place with the UK MoD, or Singapore or Germany.""

Whitby said at the briefing that contracts were in place with Germany and Singapore for Zephyr-related work but that was later corrected by Airbus

It's possible a deal for the Zephyr 8's could emerge following the publication of the strategic defense and security review later this year. Government thinking on future air ISTAR capabilities are expected to figure significantly in the review.

Defence Procurement Minister Philip Dunne pointed up the possibilities for platforms like Zephyr in a recent interview with Defense News.

""As you go closer to space there are innovative opportunities that are being considered as part of SDSR ranging from things not yet into production to things that are,"" he said

The Zephyr 8 machines will be capable of flying at around 70,000 feet for up to three months, giving military and civil customers the ability to conduct persistent surveillance or establish communications relays at a fraction of the cost of satellites or manned aircraft and significantly longer than other unmanned platforms.

The British will use the three UAVs for operational capability demonstrations, including flying two of the machines at the same time, Whitby told reporters.

Deliveries of the machines for the British are expected to take place over the next 15 to 18 months and the first test flight is scheduled for 2017, he said. The British have conducted flight tests on an earlier, smaller version of the Zephyr they acquired from Airbus.

The UAV holds the world record for flight duration of 14 days, and Whitby said the vehicle comfortably outperforms solar-powered rivals. The Zephyr's batteries are fueled by the sun during the day and the energy is used during the night to power the machine's two propellers.

The new Zephyr 8 with its 28-meter wingspan covered in solar panels is expected to fly for the first time next summer and is capable of carrying up to 5 kilograms of surveillance or communications payload.

An even larger and better performing variant is on the drawing board. Known for now as Zephyr, the vehicle could be ready to fly in about two-and-a-half years, said Airbus executives.

The Zyphyr high-altitude, long-endurance vehicle is likely to figure in the work the MoD is doing to update its aging ISTAR asset base as part of the strategic defense and security review expected to be published by the end of the year.

Whitby said the British were one of several nations looking at the capabilities offered in the defense and security sectors.

Airbus is in discussions with Singapore over studying various launch and landing options for Zephyr, including the use of an ""enormous barge."" The two sides are also looking at possible joint development of a Zephyr-specific maritime radar.

The company is also involved with the German military and police in studying the communications capabilities of Zephyr and is also engaged with the US Department of Defense and other agencies in investigating possible use of the vehicle.

Zephyr was originally developed by British company QinetiQ before Airbus purchased the program.

"A320 FAL ""good for US aerospace,"" says Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 16 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS8xNi9hMzIwLWZhbC1nb29kLWZvci11cy1hZXJvc3BhY2Utc2F5cy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sept. 16, 2015, © Leeham Co., Mobile (AL): The opening of the Airbus A320 Final Assembly Line here achieves a major set of goals set by the company 10 years ago for its own strategic purposes, but officials are also mindful of the larger impact on US aerospace.

Top executives point out that the Mobile plant reestablished a second commercial aviation assembly site in the US since the last MD-11s and MD-95s rolled out of the former McDonnell Douglas plant in Long Beach (CA) after its acquisition by The Boeing Co in 1997. Boeing continued production of the MD-11 until the end of 2000 (with deliveries occurring in 1Q2001). The last MD-95, renamed the Boeing 717, was produced in 2006. There were 200 MD-11s and 156 717s produced.

With nearly 10 years elapsing between that last 717 and the first A321ceo coming out of Mobile, Airbus officials say the creation of the FAL is not only good for Airbus and Alabama, it’s good for US aerospace.

As Leeham News and Comment previously reported, it will take years for the supply chain to develop a full aerospace cluster around Mobile, but David L. Williams, VP Procurement for Airbus Americas, sees an immediate benefit for the US supply chain—including from Washington State, where rival Boeing has most of its assembly operations.

Washington is already the second-ranked supply state for Airbus in the US (behind California), and it has been for many years. It now ranks No. 4 in dollars spent in the US, up from No. 5 a few years ago.

Ohio and Connecticut remain Nos. 1 and 2 because the CFM56/LEAP engines and Pratt & Whitney V2500/GTF engines call these states home.

Williams plans to be in Washington State in February at the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance, a supplier trade group, looking for more business from the state.

“Over time we more and more opportunities for US suppliers” at the Mobile facility, Williams told LNC Monday at the opening of the FAL. “It will take years” for them to locate here. Williams predicted it will be three to five years before a number of suppliers locate physical facilities here.

He also said “it is difficult to quantify” how much this facility increases the dollar footprint in the US today, a broader strategic goal of Airbus for many years.

Five years ago Airbus spent $10bn in the US; today it is $16bn, with suppliers in 38 states.

A321s in Airbus Mobile FAL - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS8xMy9hMzIxcy1pbi1haXJidXMtbW9iaWxlLWZhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sept, 13, 2015, (c) Leeham Co., Mobile (AL): The first two A321ceos are on the Final Assembly Line (FAL) at the new Airbus plant here in Mobile (AL).

JetBlue is scheduled to take the first delivery in the second quarter next year, followed by an A321ceo for American Airlines by the end of next year.

The slow pace reflects the need to certify every step of the assembly process, which begins nest week with an audit by Europe’s EASA, through the learning curve necessary for a new facility and training the hundreds of employees initially hired.

By the end of next year, Airbus plans to be assembling A320ceos at the rate of four per month, the initial target for this first manufacturing facility on US soil. The plant has the capacity to produce eight a month.

In the first of several briefings over two days, Airbus provided an international group of journalists the first

look at the completed facilities.

Airbus currently has 116 acres, with 56 acres developed with the “trans-shipment” building, the assembly plant, paint hangar, testing facilities and the delivery center. Airbus has another 116 acres for expansion.

For Airbus, this new facility is the culmination of nearly a decade-long effort to established a footprint on US soil that started with the controversial, and ultimately, ill-fated bid to win a contract to sell 179 aerial refueling tankers to the US Air Force. Boeing eventually won the contract, and for a time, it appeared Airbus’ plans for the Mobile plant were dead.

But from this, the effort to assemble the A320 family here evolved, said Troy Wayman, vice president of economic development for the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce.

Timo Zaremba, manager of Product Quality for the A320 Mobile plant, said EASA, the European regulatory agency, will be responsible for certifying the Mobile plant, its operations and flight testing even though this is on US soil where the US Federal Aviation Administration has jursidiction.

Because of the reciprocal agreement between EASA and the FAA, and because Airbus (as a European airplane company) is regulated by EASA, the European agency will be the authority.

The audit begins next week and will last for two weeks, a major milestone in certifying the plant and its operations.

Airbus said there are currently 260 employees at the plant, including 40 ex-pats. When the plant goes to rate eight, about 1,000 people will be employed here. US employees were trained for 6-9 months at Airbus facilities in Europe.

Airbus didn’t have an estimate of the indirect job numbers currently benefiting from the direct employment. In Washington State, home of Boeing, the ratio is about 2.5 to one.

Wayman, the Chamber of Commerce official, said that so far there hasn’t been an influx of supplier jobs, nor does he expect a significant number any time soon, noting it takes years for the supply chain to follow the manufacturing site. There is plenty of room around the Airbus plant at the former Brookley Air Force Base, which closed in 1969, now in civilian use. FedEx has a facility here. Honeywell of the US and MAAS Aviation from Dublin opened facilities here. Honeywell provides all power plant electric, gas and water facilities. MAAS paints the airplanes in 6-8 days, depending on the complexity of the livery.

The A320 fuselage, wings and components continue to be manufactured overseas and are shipped via ocean freight to Mobile, where there is a deep water port. The components are trucked to the plant four miles away and received in the trans-shipment building before being moved to the assembly plant. The assembly lines are “flow” lines vs moving lines.

Airbus Defence and Space to build Tetra terminal repair centre in Beirut - Airbus,"Mon, 07 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNS0wOS1haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2UtdG8tYnVpbGQtdGV0cmEtdGVybWluYWwtcmVwYWlyLWNlbnRyZS1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Encouraged by the growing Tetra (terrestrial trunked radio) market in Lebanon, Airbus Defence and Space and its local value-added reseller Serta Channels SAL have decided to build a certified Tetra terminal repair centre in Beirut.

This step is in line with the Ministry of Interior of Lebanon’s decision to award Airbus Defence and Space and its partner Serta Channels a contract for a digital Tetra radio communication system for the country’s security forces (General Directorate of General Security – GDGS) early this year. The proximity of the repair centre will provide the GDGS’s Tetra terminal users with instant maintenance and repair services.

As part of the country’s ongoing modernisation measures, the new Tetra system is replacing the existing analogue networks. It will be used by more than 3,000 subscribers of the government intelligence services, which ensure national security and public order throughout Lebanon. The new Tetra network will enable security forces to carry out mission-critical communication across sensitive locations in Lebanon, such as airports, seaports and borders. This is essential given the security challenges resulting from the country’s geographical location.

Airbus Defence and Space’s network will be the most advanced Tetra system in Lebanon and offer full coverage across the country. The company also cooperates with Serta Channels in the field of cyber security.

Serta, an information and communication technology solutions provider, was founded in 2009. The company partners with leading vendors to offer a comprehensive portfolio of voice, data and secure communications as well as cybersecurity solutions and professional services for fixed and wireless carriers, government agencies and public sectors. Its main markets include the Middle East, Africa and Turkey."

ORLANDO -- Emirates airline has commenced its newest U.S. route, connecting one of America's top tourist destinations to one of the world's fastest-growing aviation hubs.

Just after 11:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Emirates touched down at Orlando International Airport. Its inaugural daily non-stop flight -- Emirates Flight 219 -- arrived nearly 16 hours after taking off from Dubai International Airport. The return flight -- Emirates Flight 220 is set to depart from Orlando on Wednesday afternoon, fully inaugurating daily round-trip service between the cities.

ARCHIVES: USA welcomes first A380 flight on Emirates (August 2008)

The partnership between Emirates and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority has been five years in the making, linking two of the world's busiest airports. Dubai International Airport is expected to serve 82 million passengers this year, and the Orlando area welcomed 62 million visitors last year.

""I am pleased we are able to make this announcement today,"" Emirates CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said Tuesday in Orlando. . ""Emirates is proud to be a connector of people, places and economies.""

""We are honored to call your city our new home,"" he continued.

The estimated economic impact of the new daily flight from Dubai to Orlando is upwards of $100 million annually, according to Frank Kruppenbacher, chairman of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.

""This is such an economic engine for the community – very exciting,"" said U.S. Representative Corrine Brown from the 5th District of Florida.

Among the biggest upsides for Orlando, the Emirates route will provide one of the quickest one-stop routings between Orlando and burgeoning markets like India and Southeast Asia.

""Emirates is a premier airline and this is a significant new air service route for Orlando International as it opens the gateway to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and even Australia and the Great Barrier Reef,"" Kruppenbacher added in a statement.

Emirates' debut arrival marked another first for Orlando International Airport. It was the first time that an airline has flown an A380 to Orlando on a regularly scheduled passenger flight. A380s have visited Orlando before -- either on a promotional visit or as a diversion -- but Tuesday's flight was the first to arrive with paying airline passengers on a regularly scheduled Orlando-bound flight.

As for Emirates, it has partnerships in place with three U.S. airlines – JetBlue, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines. Of particular note in Orlando would be Emirates' partnership with JetBlue, which has a busy operation there.

However, while Emirates' inaugural Orlando flight was on an A380, the carrier's regular service on the route will be on Boeing 777-200LR aircraft. The planes offer eight first-class ""suites,"" 42 lie-flat business-class seats and 216 seats in coach.

Amenities in all classes include multi-course meals and complimentary drinks; personal digital widescreen TVs with up to 100 channels, 600 audio channels and up to 100 video games; noise-cancelling headphones; auto-adjusting lighting designed to reduce jet-lag and in-seat power supply.

Emirates' arrival into Orlando marks its 10th gateway in the USA and fourth on the Eastern Seaboard. Emirates began flying to the USA in 2004. It's other U.S. destinations are Boston, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston Bush Intercontinental, Los Angeles, New York JFK, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington Dulles."

European planemaker Airbus has gone head-to-head with its arch-rival Boeing by establishing a $600 million final assembly plant in the US.

The facility, in Mobile, Alabama, is its first US-based production plant. It will be used to make four A320 single-aisle aircraft a month by 2018.

Toulouse-based Airbus has recorded several multi-million pound sales successes with North American airlines in recent years. The A320 family has been outselling its direct competitor, the Boeing 737, and Airbus has been struggling to meet demand from its existing final assembly plants in Hamburg. Germany, and Tianjin, China.

Fabrice Bregier said that the opening of the Mobile plant represented a historic moment that was “years in the making”.

He said: “It marks the most significant game-changing event in the US aerospace market for decades.”

Airbus has a growing presence in the US, with A320 customers including United Airlines, Delta, American Airlines, JetBlue and Frontier Airlines. Bregier said that sales would continue to grow.

He said: “The output from the Mobile plant will be swallowed by the American market.”

Bregier predicted that US airlines would buy a total of 4,700 single aisle aircraft over the next 20 years.

The physical layout of the Mobile plant is based on the company's existing A320 family assembly lines. Overall, the supply stream for systems and components will remain mostly the same.

Fully-equipped sections of aircraft, including the wings from the UK, will be shipped by sea and road to the plant in Mobile. Meanwhile, other major components will be packaged at Airbus' main logistics centre in Hamburg, Germany, before being sent by ship or air to the US.

Some US-origin parts will be delivered directly to the facility by road or rail.

The first fully-assembled plane will leave the Mobile plant next year. Production will then be ramped up to four aircraft per month by 2018. That figure could be boosted to eight planes a month with a “modest amount of additional capital expenditure”, said Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas.

Airbus has leased additional land adjacent to the Mobile site, which could be used to expand the A320 plant.

Airbus now employs a total of 1,400 workers in the US. In addition to the new Mobile plant, it also has a design and engineering centre in Witchita, Kansas, which employs around 340 engineers carrying out design and stress work on its wings. It also a major sales and marketing office Herndon, Virginia, and a 24-hour spares centre in Ashburn, Virginia."
Airbus officially opens A320 final assembly line in Alabama - Flightglobal,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9mZmljaWFsbHktb3BlbnMtYTMyMC1maW5hbC1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lLWluLWFsYWJhbWEvMTE4MTgwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today staged an official grand opening for the A320 family final assembly line and delivery centre in Mobile, Alabama, with executives touting the company’s growing stature as a US manufacturer.

“Airbus is now truly an American manufacturer,” says Airbus president and chief executive Fabrice Bregier, addressing an audience of local and state dignitiaries, employees and press gathered inside the “Hangar 9” final assembly hall.

Though the grand opening was staged on 14 September, the site has been operational for several months, with the first A321 scheduled for delivery to JetBlue Airways in the second quarter sitting at the wing-to-body join position.

Airbus first confirmed plans to build the complex in Mobile in July 2012. The new site’s initial capacity to build four A320 family aircraft per month contributes to Airbus’ planned ramp-up to 50 monthly aircraft deliveries systemwide by the end of 2017. It also allows Airbus to deliver A320 family aircraft directly to customers in North America, which represents along with China the company’s largest narrowbody market over the next 20 years.

Perhaps more importantly, the Mobile site dramatically enlarges Airbus’ corporate presence in the USA, a key part of the company’s global growth strategy. The company already has a significant industrial presence here, with its helicopter division assembling commercial and military aircraft in Columbus, Mississippi, a steadily growing defence and space operation.

But delivering four aircraft per month from a US factory, even if the more labour-intensive major component assemblies are shipped in from Europe, is a highly visible reminder of the company’s growing presence in North American airline fleets.

Signifying the company’s emerging political clout, the grand opening was attended by Alabama’s governor, a senator and at least two local congressman, along with a host of local political and economic development officials.

The company has so far hired about 260 employees to staff the site, with dozens more jobs likely as deliveries ramp up to four per month.

Airbus supplier reveals expansion details for Mobile Aeroplex facility - Yellowhammer News,"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8veWVsbG93aGFtbWVybmV3cy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXN1cHBsaWVyLXJldmVhbHMtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWRldGFpbHMtZm9yLW1vYmlsZS1hZXJvcGxleC1mYWNpbGl0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Kelli M. Dugan

In a move one official called “classic economic development,” MAAS Aviation received tax abatements totaling nearly $2.2 million Wednesday for construction of a proposed $13 million second paint facility at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley.

News of Dublin, Ireland-based MAAS’ plans to expand its footprint in Mobile broke during the second day of the 2015 Paris Air Show in June, but a company representative said the $39 million investment figure disclosed at that time embodied several long-term investment proposals intended to strengthen its position as an integral supplier to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The proposals would expand MAAS’ U.S. capabilities to target third-party original equipment manufacturers; maintenance, repair and overhaul providers; and potential military clients.

“We are a very specialized niche business … We bring world-class standards … and we complement what already exists,” Tim Macdougald, chief financial officer and commercial director of MAAS Aviation Brookley Inc., told members of the Mobile Industrial Development Board.

MAAS is nearing completion on a paint facility dedicated to servicing the A320 aircraft assembled at the recently inaugurated Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility at Brookley.

That paint facility, Macdougald said, will employ 52 within three years and pay average annual salaries of $41,000. That equates to MAAS pumping an estimated $4.4 million into the Mobile economy each year, including nearly $2.2 million in payroll, he said.

Those jobs are in addition to the 26 MAAS will have dedicated to the Airbus paint shop.

The new twin-bay painting facility – featuring a state-of-the-art vertical airflow system – will be capable of handling aircraft as large as the Boeing 757 but will also target maintenance, repair and operations painting of third-party aircraft with focus on U.S operators of single-aisle aircraft.

“Clearly, Airbus gives us an opportunity to expand our footprint here … but Airbus won’t commit to a second shop until the first is at capacity; therefore, we need an external shop,” Macdougald said, noting the byproduct is MAAS’ increased “relevance to third-party work.”

MAAS operates two paint shops in Hamburg, Germany (with a third under construction) as well as a facility the Netherlands and has a long-term contract as the exclusive paint service provider to Airbus Americas Inc.

Macdougald characterized the 30-year-old company as the “Neiman Marcus of aircraft painting” because of its focus on low-volume, high-quality craftsmanship.

Per recently passed “Made in Alabama” jobs incentives legislation, MAAS is qualified to request 20-year abatements for the expansion. Although the Mobile Industrial Development Board is authorized to approve municipal, county and state abatements through an initial 10-year period, its authority to extend the abatements an additional 10 years applies only to the city’s portion of the request. MAAS must secure separate approval for the second 10-years from both Mobile County and the state of Alabama

In recommending the project’s approval, Troy Wayman, the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce vice president of economic development, told the board the MAAS project will generate nearly $16.3 million in collectable tax revenue during the course of the abatement. “When we recruit companies like Airbus, that’s not the end of the process,” Wayman said, calling MAAS a perfect example of the ancillary development the area is beginning to see.

“This will only make us more attractive to others companies outside Airbus,” he said.

Following the vote, Industrial Development Board Chairman Mike Saxon, vice president of Alabama Power’s Mobile Division, said the ripple effect already being felt from the $600 million Airbus project is exhilarating.

“That is classic economic development,” Saxon said.

Macdougald said the implications run deeper for MAAS.

“We have no financial history in the United States,” he said, noting the board’s abatement approval “levels the playing pitch” and will allow MAAS to co-locate at Brookley alongside Airbus and VT Mobile Aerospace Engineering, the largest MRO provider in the world.

“We’re hoping this is the beginning of something, the beginning of a journey,” Macdougald said, noting MAAS’ discussions to date with the Singapore-based VT MAE have focused on ways to “directly complement existing infrastructure.”

“This project is clearly a high-end extension of the Airbus project,” he said, calling MAAS’ Mobile venture a “prime example” of the Airbus investment paying off.

“What you have here in Airbus is only the beginning,” Macdougald said."

Customers with N-registered aircraft who place orders before Nov. 4, 2015, are eligible for the free kits for modification 07.4622. The modification provides a visual indication when the collective-mounted hydraulic switch is in the “OFF” position through a flashing “HYD2” light on the caution and warning panel (CWP).

According to a letter distributed to customers by Airbus Helicopters Inc., the kits required to retrofit an aircraft will depend on its configuration and can be determined through Service Bulletin AS 350-67.00.64. When placing their orders, customers must provide the serial numbers of the aircraft for which they are ordering the kits.

The modification is intended to help prevent pilots of dual-hydraulic AS350 helicopters from inadvertently taking off with their yaw servo isolation switches in the “OFF” position — an error has been implicated in at least one recent accident . The modification has been incorporated on new-build AS350 B3e (now called H125) helicopters for the past year, but must be retrofitted on existing dual-hydraulic aircraft.

Originally, the expense of the modification was borne by operators, with the kit costing approximately US$2,250, and a new CWP to accommodate the modification available at the list price of $4,597.74. Relatively few operators undertook the retrofit promptly. According to Airbus Helicopters Inc., 204 aircraft in the U.S. fleet are eligible for the modification, but only 54 kits had been ordered by July 28, with just 10 additional orders placed by Sept. 14.

Customers who have previously ordered or have already taken delivery of kits for mod 07.4622 are eligible for a credit, provided they notify their customer support managers by Oct. 16, 2015. Airbus Helicopters has not yet announced plans to make the kits available free of charge for customers outside of the U.S."

In a much-anticipated ceremony Monday in Mobile, Airbus inaugurated operations at its first ever U.S. Manufacturing Facility. The plant – which assembles the industry-leading family of A319s, A320s and A321s – is officially open for business, with a skilled team of more than 250 Airbus manufacturing employees now at work on the first U.S.-made Airbus aircraft.

“Our commercial aircraft production in Mobile signifies two things: that Airbus has become the first truly global aircraft manufacturer, and that Airbus is now also a truly American manufacturer,” said Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier. “With the addition of our U.S. facility to our production network in Europe and Asia, we have strategically expanded our worldwide industrial base.”

“The Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility is an important step forward in Airbus’ strategy, strengthening our position as a leader and competitor in all of our key markets,” Fabrice Brégier continued. “It enables us to grow our already significant presence in America – the largest single-aisle aircraft market in the world – and to be closer to our U.S. customers and key supplier partners. At the same time, the expanded industrial capacity gives us more flexibility to increase production across Airbus to meet global demand. The U.S. facility is good news for the overall Airbus enterprise, as this greater production capacity creates global growth opportunities across the company and throughout our supply chain.”

Airbus announced plans for the $600 million U.S. Manufacturing Facility in 2012, and construction began at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley the following year. The first U.S.-made Airbus commercial aircraft – an A321 – is scheduled for delivery next spring. By 2018, the facility will produce between 40 and 50 single-aisle aircraft per year. Airbus’ market forecast indicates a demand over the next 20 years (from all manufacturers) for some 4,700 single-aisle aircraft in North America alone.

Fabrice Brégier and members of the new Airbus workforce in Mobile were joined at the inaugural ceremony today by Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, Senator Jeff Sessions, Congressman Bradley Byrne, and scores of other dignitaries, airline and aerospace executives, and local leaders. The industry- and community-wide event convened under the theme, “Let’s Get to Work – Together!” and culminated in the ceremonial placement of a placard on a component of the first aircraft to be produced in Mobile. The placard reads, “This aircraft proudly made in the U.S.A. by the worldwide team from Airbus.”

The establishment of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility doubles the number of manufacturers of large commercial aircraft in the United States, creating jobs, expanding skills, and establishing a new aerospace centre of competence on the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to the new Alabama manufacturing site, Airbus assembles commercial aircraft at modern facilities in Hamburg (Germany), Tianjin (China) and Toulouse (France)."

“All over the world, incidents with universally available small drones have revealed a security gap with regards to critical installations such as military barracks, airports or nuclear plants”, says Thomas Müller, head of the Electronics business line at Airbus Defence and Space. “As a specialist in defence electronics, we have all the technologies in our portfolio and the integration knowledge which are needed to set up a quick-response protection system with extremely low false alarm rates”.

The system offers very high effectiveness by combining sensor data from different sources with latest data fusion, signal analysis and jamming technologies. It uses operational radars, infrared cameras and direction finders from Airbus Defence and Space’s portfolio to identify the drone and assess its threat potential at ranges between 5 and 10 Kilometers. Based on an extensive threat library and realtime analysis of control signals a jammer then interrupts the link between drone and pilot and/or its navigation.

Furthermore, the direction finder tracks the position of the pilot who subsequently can be arrested. Due to the Smart Responsive Jamming Technology developed by Airbus Defence and Space, the jamming signals are blocking only the relevant frequencies used to operate the drone while other frequencies in the vicinity remain operational. Since the jamming technology contains versatile receiving and transmitting capabilities, more sophisticated measures like remote control classification and GPS spoofing can be utilized as well. This allows effective and specific jamming and also a controlled takeover of the UAV.

The Counter-UAV System has been tested extensively at Airbus Defence and Space’s own premises and during customer presentations in Germany and France. Depending on the required configuration, an operational system would be available from mid-2016.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has made history with the opening of its new facility in Mobile, Alabama, at the former Brookley Air Force Base. The company should see its first aircraft delivered early in 2016 and thousands of jobs created in the production chain.

Traditionally, the production of Airbus aircraft has taken place in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany, with individual components produced in various countries for assembly in the two cities. However, in 2011 a production line for A320 aircraft was opened in Tianjin, China, and this additional line at the Mobile Aeroplex will help Airbus raise its production rate, reach new customers and increase its global reach.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony took place Sept. 14, with a red, white and blue theme and the slogan ""Let's get to work ... together,"" emphasizing its global connectivity between the various sites around the world.

The Mobile plant is a final assembly line for the A320 family aircraft and the first parts started arriving in July. The main 200,000-square-foot assembly hall will be completed soon, but is already operational, and the new team had been hard at work to be able to present the first two aircraft on the line to the media at the ceremony. The aircraft — both A321 variants for JetBlue and American Airlines respectively — will begin testing and see delivery early in 2016.

It is hoped that the rate of production in Mobile will reach 40 or 50 aircraft per year, primarily of A321s in the first year. Around 260 staff will be employed at the site, with more than 3,500 indirect jobs supported by the plant.

All aircraft produced will be the ceo (current engine option) until 2017, when the plant will transition along with its fellow factories to the neo (new engine option) aircraft in the family, which are currently in development.

Whereas most components are flown between factories within Europe, the Mobile plant receives most of its parts via sea at the nearby deep-water port. This partially accounts for the slower production rate (as a comparison, Toulouse is aiming to see 60 A320 aircraft per month in the next few years).

However, Airbus' $600 million cost for developing the facility is seen as an investment as it is hoped that having a presence in the United States will help drive more sales from North American carriers. Airbus even added a special slogan to the tail of the first aircraft reading, ""This aircraft proudly made in the U.S.A. by the worldwide team from Airbus,"" as a means of driving home their commitment to this market and all that their presence brings.

""Airbus and Alabama share the same values and the same vision: hard work, optimism, excitement about the future, we are dedicated to quality, and we take pride in what we can accomplish,"" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said.

The new plant occupies a significant portion of what was Brookley Air Force Base until its closure in 1969. The Mobile Airport Authority, which also manages Mobile Regional Airport, took control in 1972 and is to be credited for creating a combined transportation hub that also sees maintenance carried out by various airlines and now has a significant tenant in the form of Airbus to bolster jobs and commerce for the city."

Progresses to detailed design phase

In early 2017, the first of Airbus’ five new Beluga XL airlifters will begin taking shape. These transporter aircraft are based on the Freighter version of Airbus’ A330-200 jetliner

The new Beluga programme, christened Beluga XL, has successfully passed the latest maturity gate milestone – marking the end of the ‘concept phase’ or design freeze ‘at aircraft level’ which is a key step in any development programme.The maturity gate review demonstrated that the Beluga XL programme is robust and mature enough to move to the next phase of development, the detailed design phase.“We are proud of how much we have accomplished, in less than a year after the launch of the programme, with the new and innovative way of working with our suppliers. By working together as a fully integrated team in a single location, we have maximised our efficiency. This milestone paves the way for a successful final assembly start in 2017” said Bertrand George, Head of Beluga XL programme.The Beluga XL was launched in November 2014 to address the transport capacity requirement to support the A350 XWB ramp-up and other aircraft production rate increases. Based on the A330-200 Freighter with a large re-use of existing components and equipment, the Beluga XL will be powered with Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines. The fleet of five Beluga XL aircraft will provide Airbus with an additional 30 percent extra transport capacity. The first of five Beluga XLs will enter into service in 2019.Featuring one of the most voluminous cargo holds of any aircraft today, be it civil or military, the current fleet of five A300-600ST Super Transporteraircraft named Beluga, carries complete sections of AIRBUS aircraft, produced at various sites around Europe, to the final assembly lines in Toulouse, Hamburg and Seville.The fleet of Beluga is operated by Airbus Transport International (ATI), an Airbus subsidiary airline.Beluga XL specificationsOverall length 63.1 mHeight 18.9 mFuselage diameter 8.8 mWingspan (geometric) 60.3 mWing area (reference) 361.6 m2Engines Rolls Royce Trent 700 enginesRange 2200nm at max payload (53 tonnes)Maximum take-off weight 227 tonnesMaximum landing weight 187 tonnesMaximum zero fuel weight 178 tonnes"

With top level delegations from Airbus and the State of Alabama, Airbus Group today threw open the doors to its first U.S. Final Assembly Line in Mobile, Alabama at the Brookley Aeroplex ’“ The first time a foreign manufacturer has built jets on U.S. soil.

This new production facility, specifically constructed to build Airbus A320 family aircraft destined for delivery to United States and Canadian customers, joins sister factories in Toulouse, Hamburg, and the northeastern Chinese city of Tianjin, where the company recently announced A330s would be constructed beginning in 2018.

The Mobile final assembly line opens with ambitious goals, befitting the A320 family program. First aircraft assembly began in July with the first U.S.-produced airframe, a JetBlue A321ceo (MSN6512), which is expected to roll out in the first quarter of 2016, with delivery set in the second quarter. The second aircraft, also an A321ceo for American Airlines, is set to be delivered by the third quarter of the next year.

Plans call for an initial production rate of four A320 family ceos per month by the end of 2017, following an initial start of two aircraft per month. With the A321 being ’œthe heart of the U.S. market’, the initial deliveries on the horizon are for the stretched variant. A320neo family deliveries are scheduled to begin in late 2017 / early 2018 with no drop in production rate.

Eventually, the plant has the capability to increase its production rate to eight aircraft per month by adding additional shifts (up from the 1 shift at the onset) and Cap-X expenditures. Airbus anticipates the single-line facility will produce 40 to 50 aircraft each year by 2018. This coincides with the company’s plan to raise the current monthly production rates of the A320 family from 42 to 50 by the first quarter of 2017 to fulfill a backlog of 5,439 single-aisle orders out of a total of 12,139 deliveries. The production rate could escalate to as high as 60 A320 family aircraft per month by the end of the current decade.

These lofty production goals rely on the Mobile plant as a crucial player for the A320 family aircraft program. The property has a total footprint of 116 acres (47 Hectares). Of these, 53 acres (21 Hectares) have been developed with buildings and tarmacs.

AIRBUS IN ALABAMA NEARLY GOES SOUTH

The plant, first announced in July 2012, broke ground in April 2013 with construction on the complex happening at a breakneck pace and at the cost of $600 million. This isn’t Airbus first relationship in Alabama’“two other Airbus facilities preceded the new factory. Adjacent to the new Brookley complex is the Airbus Engineering Center where more than 200 engineers are responsible for various interior elements of aircraft, including design and engineering of the cabin, crew rest, lavatories, and galleys. This center, which first opened in 2007, was particularly instrumental in the A350 program.

The Airbus Military Service Center at Mobile Regional Airport is a long-running operation supports the U.S. military’s C212 transport aircraft. The site offers MRO services, component repair, extensive material services, engineering, and technical support for US operators of the C212 and larger CN235 tactical transports.

The location of the new A320 factory in Mobile is not without precedence, nor has it been an easy journey. The site was originally selected to assemble the Airbus A330 MRTT, a replacement for the U.S. Air Force’s KC-135E Stratotankers, and A330 freighters as well. The contract was originally awarded to the joint venture between EADS and Northrop Grumman as the KC-30. The KC-30 originally won the contract against the Boeing KC-767 in 2008. Boeing protested, and by February 2011 the $35 billion contract was awarded to Boeing.

Shortly after the disappointing turn in events, an unbowed contingent led by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley secretly met with Tom Enders, then the CEO of AirbusGroup, at the Paris Air Show in 2011. With a flagging economy back home, but a strong aerospace workforce, an attractive deep water port, and a history of attracting European company manufacturing such as Mercedes-Benz to the state, the governor was determined to bring Airbus investment and jobs to Alabama. In the face of significant competition from other states, the negotiations dragged on for a year. At the end of the day, the Republican Alabama governor was able to deliver incentives totaling $158 million.

The agreement allows the state to withhold cash if Airbus doesn’t meet the investment and jobs targets. Local incentives to the tune of $33.6 million were also part of the package. City and county entities and the Mobile Airport Authority also made contributions, including lease payments, money for new construction, site preparation, land lease assistance, and roadway improvements.

According to the Alabama Department of Commerce, the $158 million incentive includes: $82 million in funds for capital investments in the plant and other expenses, $51.9 million for a 40,000-square-foot on-site training center, plus state corporate income tax credit tax breaks on manufacturing equipment.

BUILDING THE ’˜BAMA BUS

Despite the expenses and potential delays that transportation logistics method may cause, Airbus points on the low manufacturing costs and the non-unionized workforce, as well as manufacturing in the ’œDollar-Zone’ in Alabama to outweigh such expenses. Additional U.S. built aircraft components actually incur lower logistics cost by delivering straight to the Airbus In Alabama plant. Airbus has established additional FAL’s outside the Hamburg-Toulouse Axis to considerable success . The Final Assembly Line located in Tianjin, China, produces three-four aircraft per month on a similar line there. Best practices from Airbus plants are being adopted to Mobile. Boeing, on the other hand, has achieved economies of scale by centralizing all 737 production at a single factory in Renton, Washington.

THE TRANSHIPMENT BUILDING

Although the major components transported to the United States are shipped from Hamburg, these come from different countries in Europe. The front fuselage is built in France while the aft fuselage section and vertical tail plane are built in Germany. Wings are constructed in the United Kingdom and the horizontal tail plane is made in Spain. From this Building, the Major Component Assemblies (MCAs) are sent to the massive new FAL, which is divided into five work stations.

Once up to full speed, the A320 final assembly will take 25 days at an initial production rate of two aircraft per month building to four aircraft within a year. The first station, known as Station 41, is where the forward and aft sections of the fuselage are joined, and is where internal elements such as monuments the galleys are also installed. The pictures show the second A321ceo in production, to be delivered to American Airlines.

Station 40 is the second work station at the FAL and is where the wings and the fuselage are joined. The first wing / fuselage join is scheduled just 2 weeks from now. Landing gear is also installed at this station. In the pictures we can see the progress in the assembly of MSN6512 for jetBlue. This station utilizes new automatic drilling units for riveting 2,400 rivets, an Airbus first.

The third work station, named as Station 35, is where airplane powers on its own. Vertical and horizontal tail planes are assembled here and the wings are completed. Auxiliary Power Units (APU’s) are also installed in this station and the installation of the cabin furnishing begins. The nose-cone and radome are added here as well. Power up of the aircraft is first initialized here. The final station is called the Dock. Final cabin install occurs here. The landing gear functions are checked. Lighting, IFE, and cabin pressurization systems are installed and tested here. The nearly complete aircraft leaves the FAL hangar from here.

A separate building accommodating up to 2 aircraft at the same time is referred to as the Final Phase / Flight Line. Engines are hung here along with final testing before the aircraft returns outside and is sent to the paint shop.

MAAS Aviation will be in charge of painting all Airbus aircraft in Mobile. The paint hangar has an area of 27,700 sq feet (2,574m2) and will be capable of painting all A320 family aircraft’“A318, A319, A320 and A321 equipped with Sharklets and NEO options.

Airbus has also opened a delivery center ’“ its fourth – with U.S. based flight crews for Airbus and customer test flights. Deliveries from Airbus In Alabama, as with final assembly will be limited to North American customers ’“ primarily to those in America. With the enormous order backlog, many A320 family airframes will still be assembled in Toulouse and Hamburg, even if the production rate ends up ramping up.

ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT U.S. AEROSPACE MILESTONE IN DECADES

At a press conference held after the tour, Fabrice Brgier, Airbus President and CEO opened the event when he commented ’œTomorrow (September 14) will mark one of the most significant events in American aerospace in decades. Overnight, the number of manufacturers of jetliners in the U.S. will be doubled.’

Brgier explains ’œWhat counted was to be present in the United States. There are other less expensive places to build, but we feel at home here.’ Allan McCartor, Chairman and CEO of Airbus Group, Inc., boasted ’œthere are efficiencies being in the US such as being in the dollar zone and to be in key industrial areas of Europe, US, and China is part of our global strategy.’

McCartor is clear that the organization considers itself essentially a U.S. company. As proof, they cite the economic impact of the Airbus presence in the United States: 3,800 employees, presence in 16 different states and supporting 245,000 jobs in the United States with spending of $16.5 billion. In Alabama alone, ’œThis has contributed over 1,000 direct jobs. Annual economic impact to state is over $409 million in additional GDP.’

THE SINGLE-AISLE MARKET SEGMENT: A BURGEONING DEMAND

The single-aisle mainline jetliner segment is certainly burgeoning. Airbus forecasts a worldwide demand for more than 20,000 single-aisle aircraft over the next 20 years. According to Airbus Americas President Barry Eccleston, the perspectives are bullish. ’œWe have over 12,000 firm orders and have delivered 6,700 A320 family aircraft,’ he said.

Boeing, for its part assembles the 737 at 42 per month at a single factory in Renton, but plans to raise 737 production to 47 per month by 2017 and 52 per month by the following year in 2018. The company says it could easily ramp up to 60 ’“ all this while the 737 Max prototype has begun production with deliveries first scheduled in 2017. As of the end of August, the competing 737 had 4,269 aircraft on back-order and deliveries of 8,674 airframes.

According to Airbus, the A320 has the 54% of the market share versus the Boeing 737 family aircraft. The forthcoming new engine option (neo) variant has helped to drive this market share. ’œThe neo has secured 4,193 orders from 74 customers,’ Eccleston stated.

“Airbus already reports 1,340 airplanes in operation with North American operators. The United States continues to be the world’s largest market with a demand for 4,730 single aircraft in North America over the next 20 years. The market forecast extends to 1,000 twin aisle aircraft and 150 VLAs,’ Eccleston forecasted.

In success, Airbus Mobile could be a candidate for additional work. Allan McCartor says in a ’œtie-breaking situation’, the ’œMade In America’ promise could make the difference in winning an order. Further, Airbus doesn’t rule out one day assembling and delivering aircraft here to non North American customers ’“ which would allow it to tap Ex-Im Bank financing. With these eye popping forecasts and optimism, Airbus Mobile has planted a historic flag on U.S. soil that has the potential to become even more significant.

American accidentally sends uncertified plane to Hawaii - CNN,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS8xMy9wb2xpdGljcy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1oYXdhaWktYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Washington CNN —

American Airlines confirms to CNN that it accidentally put an Airbus A321S aircraft – that was not certified to fly over the Pacific – on a long-haul flight from Los Angeles to Hawaii.

American spokesman Casey Norton said “someone on the ground” realized the mix-up sometime after AA Flight 31 had departed LAX on August 31st, filled with passengers and crew. American Airlines declined to identify who first noticed the mistake.

Norton said American immediately notified the flight crew and the Federal Aviation Administration and the decision was made to allow the crew to complete the flight, and the plane landed safely in Honolulu.

Hawaii-bound aircraft are required by the FAA to have extra fire suppression equipment in the cargo hold and extra medical equipment on board, including oxygen – since there are no points in between for an aircraft to divert to if there is an on board emergency. American Airlines said the correct aircraft, the A321-H, was just put into service on August 18th.

Norton said the new plane was part of the airline’s long-term strategy to upgrade service, and it replaced a Boeing 757 that flew that route up until last month.

“Somebody screwed up big-time, somewhere,” an American Airlines pilot, who is not authorized to speak on the record, told CNN.

The pilot explained that maintenance crews have to sign off on all extended operation certified equipment on any long-range aicrcraft and have a checklist of items that they have to go through and approve before a plane is certified to fly.

“All (extended operation) related equipment must be certified and be operational before a plane is cleared to fly. That means everything from oil quantities, to crew oxygen quantities, to retardants – they all have to be looked at,” he said. “All I can say is, thank God they didn’t have an emergency on that flight.”

For its part, American Airlines said once the mistake was identified they acted quickly.

“When we realized what happened, we immediately notified the FAA and began a thorough review of our procedures,” Norton said. “Already, we have revised our software to properly identify the correct aircraft are operating the correct routes.”

The return flight on that aircraft was canceled, and the plane was flown back to LAX with just a minimal crew on board.

“The A321-S flies over water regularly for many missions, but is not (extended operation certified), which is required by the FAA for American’s Hawaiian flights,” Norton said, adding that both planes are very similar otherwise, with the same engines and same range.

CNN has reached out to the FAA for comment, but has not heard back."

The airframer is intending the performance-enhancement package to be an option on the re-engined type, which is due to enter service this year.

Airbus embarked on the short-airfield scheme – which it has designated ‘SHARP’ – to assist with operations into airports including Rio de Janeiro’s Santos Dumont.

Santos Dumont has a runway which is only 1,320m (4,330ft) in length. The airframer says it has identified a number of A320neo customers which “would like to fly” into the airport.

“[This package] will allow them to do so,” it adds.

Airbus says the upgrade, developed by its UK and German engineering personnel, includes a composite panel modification to the wing-root fairing which will “optimise” airflow, and enable slower approach speeds.

Airbus

The manufacturer used additive-layer manufacturing techniques to help produce the prototype parts.

Airbus says flight-testing of the modified section – which could be offered as a retrofit – has been “successful” and that the design is being finalised ahead of the cutover to A320neo production.

Production of the 2.6t helicopter – which is also known as the Twin Squirrel or Twin Star in the USA – is, however, likely to continue through next year, as the airframer runs through its remaining order backlog.

The manufacturer says the decision was driven by a need to trim its product range and focus on stronger-selling models to better answer the needs of the market and its customers.

Production of the two other rotorcraft in the Squirrel family – the H125 and H130 – will continue, however.

Airbus Helicopters

“Airbus Helicopters remains committed to continuous improvement of the H125 and H130 for higher competitiveness and increased customer satisfaction,” it says, while adding that it “will continue to support the more than 600 AS355s currently in service worldwide.”

Although in production since 1979, the AS355 has since 2007 been offered as the NP variant, which is fitted with FADEC-equipped Turbomeca Arrius 1A1 engines and boasts a fast cruise speed of 120kt (222km/h) with a maximum range of 395nm (731km).

Counter-UAV System from Airbus Defence and Space protects against illicit intrusion - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2NvdW50ZXJ1YXZzeXN0ZW1mcm9tYWlyYnVzZGVmZW5jZWFuZHNwYWNlcHJvdGVjdHNhZ2FpbnN0aWxsaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space’s Counter-UAV System is able to signal a jammer which interrupts the link between an intrusive drone and its pilot. Airbus Defence and Space Photo

Airbus Defence and Space has developed a Counter-UAV System which detects illicit intrusions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over critical areas at long ranges and offers electronic countermeasures minimizing the risk of collateral damage.

“All over the world, incidents with universally available small drones have revealed a security gap with regards to critical installations such as military barracks, airports or nuclear plants,” says Thomas Müller, head of the electronics business line at Airbus Defence and Space. “As a specialist in defence electronics, we have all the technologies in our portfolio and the integration knowledge which are needed to set up a quick-response protection system with extremely low false alarm rates.”

The system offers very high effectiveness by combining sensor data from different sources with latest data fusion, signal analysis and jamming technologies. It uses operational radars, infrared cameras and direction finders from Airbus Defence and Space’s portfolio to identify the drone and assess its threat potential at ranges between five and 10 kilometres. Based on an extensive threat library and realtime analysis of control signals a jammer then interrupts the link between drone and pilot and/or its navigation.

Furthermore, the direction finder tracks the position of the pilot who subsequently can be arrested. Due to the Smart Responsive Jamming Technology developed by Airbus Defence and Space, the jamming signals are blocking only the relevant frequencies used to operate the drone while other frequencies in the vicinity remain operational. Since the jamming technology contains versatile receiving and transmitting capabilities, more sophisticated measures like remote control classification and GPS spoofing can be utilized as well. This allows effective and specific jamming and also a controlled takeover of the UAV.

The Counter-UAV System has been tested extensively at Airbus Defence and Space’s own premises and during customer presentations in Germany and France. Depending on the required configuration, an operational system would be available from mid-2016."

Airbus has officially opened its first assembly plant on American soil, in a clear challenge to its US rival Boeing.

The site at Mobile, Alabama is the result of a $600 million, (530 million euros), investment by Europe’s leading aircraft manufacturer.

Airbus intends to assemble its A320 medium-sized airliners from parts built elsewhere in the Gulf Coast city, as it sets its sights on expanding its share of the North American market.

“Today is a moment of pride, not only for my teammates behind me but for all Airbus people, everywhere.Today Airbus is becoming a truly global manufacturer and a truly American manufacturer,” said Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier.

New figures show that Airbus beat Boeing on orders in the first half of this year but that it remained behind on deliveries.

Airbus said it had won orders for 382 aircraft over that period, compared to 325 for Boeing.

However Boeing maintained a lead in terms of deliveries, the main indicator for short-term revenue. The US planemaker delivered 381 aircraft in the first six months, while Airbus said it had delivered 304 planes to customers.

The European planemaker still lags behind Boeing in the US, the world’s biggest market for airliner sales, though new orders for single-aisle planes should help Airbus make inroads.

Some analysts believe higher production rates at the American manufacturer should help Boeing sustain its global market share."

[Photo/Agencies] Aircraft maker expects to sell 60 more by the end of the year

Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, is expecting to sell 60 aircraft to buyers on the Chinese mainland by the end of the year in a market which is ""emerging and booming"", according to its president in the country.

""We expect a 100 percent increase in orders each year, and estimate that around 50 to 60 helicopters made by us will have been sold here within the year,"" said Norbert Ducrot, on the sidelines of the Third China Helicopter Expo that concluded in Tianjin over the weekend.

Last year the European aircraft maker, previously Eurocopter Group before being renamed in January 2014, had 32 Chinese mainland orders.

Ducrot claims to have more than 40 percent of the mainland's civil-helicopter market, with around 150 civil helicopters made by the company being used by government departments and enterprises on the mainland.

Airbus Helicopters has supplied 12,000 aircraft globally to more than 3,000 customers.

Ducrot said he expects China to soon surpass the United States as the biggest civil market in terms of annual bookings, and says his company is poised to take advantage of its lucrative potential.

""If China's helicopter demand in the emergency medical services, for example, is to be fully satiated, then there could be a market for up to 3,000 aircraft,"" he said.

China is targeting more than 150 helicopters deliveries per year by 2020.

Ducrot said the individuals' market for helicopters on the mainland is still largely under-developed due to a host of factors, but ""we are planning to set up more maintenance centers, train more pilots and expand our capacity to pave the way for those potential buyers to place more orders too"".

Statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China show that the number of civil helicopters on the mainland increased from 387 in 2013 to 524 in 2014, a 37.5 percent rise.

Airbus Helicopters' most notable corporate order so far has been with China Minsheng International Financial Leasing Corp Ltd, a subsidiary of China Minsheng Investment, which has ordered 100 of its Ecureuil-series helicopters over the next five years. The first batch of 10 will be delivered next year."
American mistakenly used wrong plane for overwater flight to Hawaii - USA TODAY,"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE1LzA5LzE0L2FtZXJpY2FuLW1pc3Rha2VubHktdXNlcy11bmNlcnRpZmllZC0tb3ZlcndhdGVyLWZsaWdodC0taGF3YWlpLzcyMjQ0MTYyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American mistakenly used wrong plane for overwater flight to Hawaii

Show Caption Hide Caption American Airlines accidentally sends the wrong plane to Hawaii American Airlines admits it accidentally used a plane that wasn't certified to fly over the Pacific for a recent flight from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Jen Markham (@jenmarkham) has the story. Buzz60

American Airlines mistakenly operated a Hawaii flight with an aircraft that was not certified for long over-water flights, the company has acknowledged.

The flight occurred Aug. 31 on a route from Los Angeles to Honolulu. The airline is now revising its internal procedures after the incident, according to aviation blogger Brian Sumers, who first reported the story.

American's mistake centered not on whether the Airbus A321 had the range to fly from California to Hawaii – it is able to do so – but rather on whether it was properly certified.

Planes that fly long over-water routes must receive special certification for such flights. That certification is known as ""ETOPS,"" which stands for ""Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards.""

The Washington Post notes the certification ""is primarily an administrative requirement, but it also calls for the planes to be equipped with extra oxygen and a fire suppression canister.""

American says it notified the Federal Aviation Administration as soon as it realized the mistake had been made.

When we realized what happened, we immediately notified the FAA and began a thorough review of our procedures,"" American spokesman Casey Norton says to Today in the Sky. ""Already, we have revised our software to properly identify the correct aircraft are operating the correct routes.""

American spokesman Casey Norton explains to AFP that – except for the ETOPS certification – the A321S that mistakenly flew the Hawaii trip is the same as the A321H that was supposed to fly the route.

""American's A321S flies over water regularly for many missions, but is not ETOPS-certified, which is required by the FAA for American's Hawaiian flights,"" American adds to ABC. ""The A321S is equipped with four slide-rafts (one at each corner of the aircraft) and one portable raft in addition to life vests and seat cushions that can serve as flotation devices.""

""It has the same engine, same fuel tanks, same range,"" Norton says to AFP.

Speaking to The Associated Press, FAA spokesman Les Dorr said agency officials cannot recall any past incidents quite like this one.

The Aug. 31 incident came about two weeks after American switched from Boeing 757s to Airbus A321s for its L.A.-Honolulu route.

China’s flag carrier Air China has taken delivery of its 50th A330 in Toulouse, France. The aircraft, an A330-300 is the first 242 tonnes maximum take-off-weight (MTOW) version to be operated by a Chinese airline. The increased MTOW allows airlines to operate longer range at improved operating costs.

Displaying a special livery to celebrate the “50th A330 for Air China”, the aircraft is configured with a three class cabin layout (30 business, 16 premium economy and 255 economy)

“We congratulate Air China on the milestone of receiving its 50th A330 and we express our gratitude for the confidence shown in the A330,” said Eric Chen, President Airbus China. “With one of the world’s largest A330 fleets, Air China is already benefiting from the aircraft’s lower operating costs, proven reliability and great passenger appeal. As always, we will provide strong customer support to Air China.”

Based in Beijing, Air China serves today’s most important routes. Air China’s started operating the A330 in 2006 and has become the airline’s benchmark wide-body aircraft.

Air China has one of the world’s largest A330 fleets providing the airline with maximum versatility and support for its rapid growth on domestic and international routes. The A330s including Air China’s A320 fleet are deployed on the airlines’ most demanding routes requiring superior performance aircraft to serve high altitude airports in the south west of the country.

The 242 tonnes A330 is the platform for the future A330neo, and is a concrete example of Airbus’ incremental innovation strategy. Thanks to the latest engine improvements, and an aerodynamics, the A330 with 242 tonnes MTOW offers an extended range of up to 500 nautical miles and up to two percent reduced fuel consumption.

The A330 is one of the most popular wide-body aircraft and has won over 1,500 orders, with over 1,200 delivered to some 110 operators worldwide. Offering the lowest operating costs in its category, and thanks to the continuous investment and introduction of innovations, the A330 is the most profitable and best performing aircraft in its class, with an average operational reliability of 99.4 percent.

"Airbus patents economy-class sleep pods, incites dreams of a more comfortable future - USA TODAY","Mon, 28 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTUvMDkvMjgvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudHMtZWNvbm9teS1jbGFzcy1zbGVlcC1wb2RzLWluY2l0ZXMtZHJlYW1zLW9mLWEtbW9yZS1jb21mb3J0YWJsZS1mdXR1cmUvODMwNzE2NDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus patents economy-class sleep pods, incites dreams of a more comfortable future

For many of us, the biggest challenge on a flight is trying to find a position that allows even a brief moment of sleep. If you're in economy and over six feet tall, this often involves contorting your knees and neck to tortuous angles probably prohibited by the Geneva Convention.

But if the patent filed by Airbus last week gives any indication, relief might be on the way. Rather than ponying up thousands of dollars for plush flat-bed seats or even full-blown beds in business and first class, passengers may get the chance to slip into stacked sleep pods at economy prices.

Referred to as a “sleeping box” in the patent application (let's hope the name gets changed later), the chambers are designed for economy class, whose seats, Airbus admits in the patent, are “only movable to a limited extent and therefore can be found by passengers to be uncomfortable, particularly on long haul flights.""

It looks as though passengers will be able to purchase spots in the pods instead of—not in addition to—regular seats, as the boxes are designed to be safe enough for take off and landing. The sleep pods are equipped with safety straps and airbags, and their orientation, perpendicular to the cabin, provides additional protection in the event of an emergency.

As for comfort, the pods are equipped with a “reclining cushion” which can be elevated so that occupants can view the television suspended from the ceiling.

If done right, the pods may represent a significant step forward for comfort in economy, especially on overnight flights. Certainly questions remain, particularly how passengers will get in and out of these, especially if they're arranged in stacks of three, as the patent describes—economy boarding is usually a patience-trying game of Tetris as it is.

But while trying to eat your in-flight pasta meal might prove difficult while pod-bound, the incidental sound barrier between you and that one screaming baby should make it all worth it."
"Taking aim at Boeing, Airbus opens first US plant - Yahoo Singapore News","Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9haXJidXMtb3Blbi11cy1qZXQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1wbGFudC1maXJzdC0wODUxMDI2OTUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European jetmaker Airbus inaugurated its first US plant Monday in a move to wrest away a chunk of rival Boeing's domination of the domestic aircraft market, including lucrative Pentagon contracts. Airbus plans to assemble 40-50 of its single-aisle A320 family every year beginning in 2018 from the plant, built on the site of a World War II bomber support base in Mobile, Alabama. Decking out the location with US flags, the European industrial giant hopes the ""Made In America"" stamp on its aircraft will help carve a larger chunk from Boeing's dominance of the North American market for passenger aircraft. ""The message is simply, we like this market, we like to be in America. We are here and we are here to stay. We are an American company now,"" said Thomas Enders, chief executive of parent Airbus Group. With loudspeakers blasting out the 1974 rock anthem ""Sweet Home Alabama"" at Monday's ceremony, Governor Robert Bentley called it ""a great day for Mobile and all the state of Alabama."" Three years ago, Airbus had a 20 percent share of the US market, against 80 percent for Boeing. Since announcing the Mobile plant, its market share has doubled to 40 percent. The company, based just outside Toulouse, France, is focused on the estimated 5,000 new passenger planes expected to be ordered in North America over the next 20 years. But another important aim of the new facility is greater access to the huge US defense budget. Airbus's identity as a foreign maker helped undermine its fight in 2011 against Boeing for a $30 billion Pentagon contract for aerial refueling tankers. The $600 million production line is only Airbus's second one outside Europe -- the first is in Tianjin, China. Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier called the inauguration ""a historic day."" ""While Airbus has deep European roots, we have always seen ourselves as citizens of the world,"" he said. ""Thanks to Mobile, the sun will never set on Airbus."" - Lower labor costs - The company expects the new plant, which will employ 1,000 workers in the final assembly of the aircraft, to help reduce production costs and make them more competitive price-wise. Alabama has one of the lowest minimum wages in the United States -- $7.25 per hour -- and employment benefits are about 30 percent less expensive than in Europe. In addition, by producing in the United States, Airbus will reduce risks tied to the shifting US-euro exchange rate. The Mobile plant will assemble single-aisle A319, A320 and A321 jets, its best-selling aircraft first launched in 1988. Starting in 2017, it will also assemble the A320 Neo, a new version with a more fuel-efficient engine. The first aircraft are scheduled to roll off the assembly line in early 2016, destined for US carriers JetBlue and American Airlines. Airbus hopes to produce four planes per month starting in 2018, but will have the capacity for eight a month. Besides the currency protections, the new plant helps Airbus competitively in two other ways, said Richard Aboulafia of aerospace industry consultant Teal Group. ""It gives them a larger industrial presence, which could be useful in pursuing defense contracts. It puts pressure on trade unions back in Europe, because labor in Alabama costs less,"" he said. Hans Weber, president of aviation consultant Tecop International, said the defense angle is particularly important, especially since European governments have cut back their military procurement. The United States accounts for about 35 percent of global defense spending. But Airbus ranks just 84th on the Pentagon's list of top contractors, according to BGA-Aeroweb. ""Competing in the US defense sector has a very strong public component to it. It really means that you would have to look as much as you can like an American company,"" Weber said. ""There were some competitions they did not even participate in because they realized they did not have the political strength here to be successful,"" he noted."
On-Demand Cabins: The New In-Flight Entertainment - Avionics Magazine,"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUuYXZpYXRpb250b2RheS5jb20vb24tZGVtYW5kLWNhYmlucy10aGUtbmV3LWluLWZsaWdodC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We examine how airframe manufacturers are providing the infrastructure that operators then build upon with innovative content deals and third party partnerships to facilitate today's airborne on-demand cabin.

When JetBlue first equipped its Airbus A320s with antennas broadcasting satellite television service from DirecTV onto high-resolution backseat television screens, it revolutionized the concept of In-flight Entertainment (IFE). But in 2015, IFE has been transformed to focus more on what passengers want to see on demand versus what's installed and readily available to them. Commercial and business aviation operators are embracing a new cabin environment where passengers upload, download and wirelessly sync to content and new forms of media by just swiping a touchscreen.

""Operators are responding to consumer desires to bring their own devices … by creating IFE portals that allow cabin passengers to download either applications that allow them to run the content, or simply sync to the content from their own devices to a server embedded in the aircraft,"" says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

Airlines, charter operators and fractional jet providers are all experiencing a shift in their customers' demand for unique, customized cabin entertainment based on their own desires. Avionics Magazine spoke with Airbus and Boeing, and five of the world’s largest airlines with combined fleets of 1,008 total aircraft across three different countries to unveil what the evolving on-demand cabin environment looks like.

The Airbus A350XWB recently rolled out of the factory in Toulouse and, upon entering service, it is the first Airbus airframe to feature a fourth generation IFE architecture. Under the fourth generation architecture, Airbus has made the baseline IFE infrastructure scalable and easier to upgrade. Among the features are a fiber-optic backbone, hardwired for high bandwidth and Ultra High Definition (Ultra-HD) with 3-D capable screens cabin wide.

“The ‘future-proof’ IFE of the A350 XWB delivers high-definition content to all passengers, featuring for the first time 12 inch screens in Economy class and touch screen control. Its simpler architecture results in a leaner physical integration. For example, the A350 XWB is the only aircraft which maintains the cabin floor flat even with IFE installed,” says Patrick Candelier, cabin services product marketing manager at Airbus.

Under the fourth generation architecture, Airbus introduced a fiber optic backbone, which provides five times the throughput per passenger of the previous generation. Traditional area distribution boxes, which were a constant source of zonal failure in previous IFE generations, have also been eliminated, and the wall mounted overhead monitors are now fed from the seat to a set cable network.

“The integration of the latest generation IFE platforms into the seat preserves passengers’ legroom and also gives them the ability to connect their own personal electronic devices, such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop to their screen,” says Candelier. “Not only can they recharge their devices, but can complement the airline’s entertainment offer with their own content, whilst benefiting from the viewing comfort of the high definition larger screens available on-board.”

Finally, on the A350 XWB and all of its current in production aircraft, Airbus provides a major component of IFE, with its Airline Network Architecture and standard SwiftBroadband (SBB) satellite communications connectivity.

Airbus also wanted to keep costs down for airlines, along with a flexible architecture that can be customized with aftermarket products.

“Each seat column (nine in total) provides redundancy by design, at no additional cost, thanks to the unique star/ring architecture,” says Candilier. “In short, the A350 XWB IFEC system confers a quantum leap in IFE both for the passenger experience as well as the airline economics.”

Across its various airframe types, Boeing works to implement a standard digital architecture that allows for a simplified interface to the aircraft systems. For example, across its 777 and 747 models, Boeing's interface kit establishes a protocol for electrical requirements and timing, built in test equipment and maintenance and control logic standards. This provides a standard interface for third party suppliers to install ARINC 628 Part 3 compliant IFE technology for audio, passenger services, video and gaming.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes Cabin Systems Manager John Craig says today's on-demand cabin is primarily driven by the growing availability of airborne Wi-Fi networks, as well as ease of in-cabin content syncing between passengers' personal devices and onboard file servers and wireless access points. ""The growing trend in IFE today is with passenger connectivity and wireless streaming of content to personal devices,"" he says. ""The installation of Wi-Fi networks that allow for streaming of onboard content to personal devices is growing and seen, by some, as a direct competitor to traditional embedded IFE systems. The Wi-Fi network can then be paired with an off-board broadband satellite communication system to enable Internet connectivity to the passenger.""

Future proofing to allow for rapid incorporation of new cabin on-demand concepts, such as the partnerships JetBlue recently developed with several different third party media providers, is another focus for Boeing. Growing on-the ground consumer on-demand content distribution and subscription services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and others has conditioned consumers to expect to be able to watch whatever they want, when they want.

“The IFE and Connectivity suppliers continue to drive forward taking full advantage of the latest consumer electronic technology and leveraging that technology for in-flight solutions,” says Craig. “Boeing is focused on providing the most advanced and flexible airplane network and infrastructure to accommodate this new technology in the most efficient and timely manner possible.”

Etihad Airways

Etihad Airways is one of the largest growing Middle Eastern carriers, with a current fleet of 105 Airbus and Boeing passenger airplanes, and another 200 aircraft on firm order. Every aircraft in the fleet features a mixture of onboard Wi-Fi, mobile connectivity, and seven channels of live TV. Aside from connectivity, Etihad's evolving on-demand cabin features Audio Video On Demand (AVOD) services with on-demand movies, television shows, radio channels, and a CD library.

""Our E-BOX IFE system, features a personal TV screen in each seat and hundreds of hours of on-demand entertainment that includes over 100 movies, 250 TV shows, 16 radio channels, a 350 CD library, and up to 60 games,"" says Calum Laming, vice president of guest experience at Etihad Airways. ""Guests can also make use of seat-to-seat calls and seat-to-seat chat features that allow them to communicate with friends and family, seated in other parts of the aircraft.""

The E-Box system, featured on long haul A380s and Boeing 787s, features video touch screen handsets, capacitive-touch monitors, 3-D moving maps displays, and Android games. Etihad has also stepped up their on-demand, in-seat features by implementing an audio and video filtering functionality that allows passengers rearrange the movie and CD listings on their screens per their preference. So, for example, during a large sporting event such as last year's FIFA World Cup, which was broadcast live on Etihad aircraft, passengers could watch the game visually while listening to music from the carrier's content library.

""On the retail side, we have added an onboard shopping section which is comparable to up-market online stores and which allows guests to shop from the comfort of their seats. Premium guests can also order beverages from their seats with a choice of mixers using our [Food and Beverage] F&B application,"" adds Laming.

In the near future, Laming says the airline will continue to evolve its on-demand cabin entrainment, by evaluating new content streaming technologies, digital headsets and more integration of mobile smart phone and tablet applications into their IFE ecosystem.

Virgin Atlantic

All Virgin Atlantic aircraft feature a system that allows passengers connect their own devices to the seat-back monitor to play their stored content in high definition. But lately the London-based carrier has been highly focused on improving the on-demand cabin experience across its fleet of Boeing 787s, which include the new Vera Touch 2 IFE system with more than 400 hours of curated on-demand content.

They have also incorporated some unique social media and other unique digital Wi-Fi-based elements to their cabin experience, says Ruben Arnold, director of brand and customer engagement at Virgin Atlantic.

""As part of the 787 Dreamliner experience, customers have the opportunity to take a #SkyHighSelfie,"" says Arnold. ""Developed in conjunction with Wavealot, this bespoke application allows customers to check in on Facebook and share their location with their friends and followers mid-flight. The app will allow one check-in per person and customers can purchase the Wi-Fi to continue the conversation. The app will also act as a mile-high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air.""

Virgin has also added new on-demand features to the upper class cabin of the Boeing 787's bar area. ""New to the Upper Class cabin is a 24 touchscreen monitor over the bar showing looped animations that complement the cabin environment, as well as the option to view the innovative map on a larger screen, watch a sport program or popular event with friends, or display a business presentation for a colleague over a shared meal at the bar."" Passengers that have devices capable of syncing with it can also use that screen wirelessly to view their favorite programming.

On Virgin Atlantic flights, cabin systems also feature on-demand viewing of unreleased films, such as the children's film ""Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure"" which premiered onboard prior to being released in theaters.

""We also include content on our IFE that compliments other elements of the in-flight experience. We have guided in-flight wine tasting tutorials to help customers get the most out of selecting which wine they’d like to have with their meal,"" says Arnold.

Going forward, Virgin will look to continue to evolve the on-demand Dreamliner cabin experience.

""We’ve already added several more Dreamliners to our fleet, and our plan is to have at least 17 by 2018. As we launch the Dreamliner on more routes, there will be more opportunities to use its technology to engage with our customers to come,"" says Arnold.

United in-flight entertainment enabled for personal devices. United Airlines

United Airlines

United Airlines' principal IFE focus has been on investing in on-board technology that allows the delivery of a wide breadth of content and to make that available to customers free of charge across its fleet of 715 aircraft.

""We’re after a wide library of movies, television shows, full seasons of television shows, and tailoring more of the content experience toward what you and others are tending to these days. The days of turning on a TV and looking at linear program deciding what’s on are over,"" says Tarek Abdel Halim, managing director of passenger systems at United Airlines. ""It’s all about on-demand, and being able to watch what you want, when you want to watch it. Our mindset is we need to deliver a similar experience to that on our aircraft.""

To deliver that type of experience, United has implemented seat back embedded AVOD systems, as well as onboard servers that can stream content directly to passenger devices without a live Internet connection. But Halim admits that it is difficult to provide a cabin that truly addresses the individual on-demand viewing and entertainment preferences of each passenger.

""With millions of passengers throughout the year, we cannot expect to have an on-demand service that meets everyone’s tailored experience. But I think what is interesting is being able to address those user preferences, over time. Can we start to create a more tailored library for the passengers boarding? Can you pre-select content you’re interested in? Those will be areas we start to investigate,"" he says.

The Chicago-based carrier, as all of its competitors, is also laser-focused on constantly updating the IFE experience for its passengers.

""We talk to the airframe manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus; we talk to suppliers about this idea that we need to get more modular with more clear upgrade paths with greater frequency than traditional IFE has offered. I think they’re hearing that message. You’re starting to see it as you look at how they individually are approaching it. We’re from an airline point of view demanding that of our suppliers as we make IFE decisions,"" says Halim.

Halim said United's in-house experts are also constantly monitoring changes in consumer technologies, and are looking at future innovations around ""3-D, 360-degree viewing, and virtual reality."" To achieve a true on-demand cabin in the future though, where passengers are able to view content in the cabin on demand as they do on the ground with IP-based applications such as HBO Go and Xfinity, the answer might be in the digital storage cloud.

""Over time, the real answer to this question is through connectivity. Can the cost to deliver high speed bandwidth to every passenger that allows them to access their own cloud-based content be achievable in the near future?"" says Halim.

""I think airlines are in the content-curating space for the reason that we can’t just give you access to our own library. Its clear we’re heading toward a cloud-based content world on the ground where, through our own content deals, through our own cable, satellite and other subscriptions, we’re tailoring our own content needs for our own tastes. The ideal scenario is we facilitate that through connectivity over time. That requires more advancement in the technology and the infrastructure.""

JetBlue

JetBlue has a fleet of more than 100 aircraft with on-demand cabins that feature high-speed Ka-band satellite-based Internet connectivity, and a Ku-band signal for DirecTV as well. The airline plans to have its entire fleet connected by the end of next year, but the third party media distribution deals JetBlue continues to form drive the internal on-demand environment. In July, JetBlue entered a partnership with Major League Baseball's (MLB) interactive media and Internet company MLBAM, which allows airborne passengers to stream MLB.TV on-demand. JetBlue cabins also feature on-demand breaking news from The Wall Street Journal, and visual content from PBS, NatGeo, Vice, Harper Collins, and Time, Inc., among others. Soon, Amazon Prime members will also get the ability to start streaming content for free, while non-members will have the option to purchase that content for viewing. This is possible because JetBlue's Fly-Fi service offers in-flight connection speeds of up to 20 mbps per device.

""We launched Fly-Fi two years ago and it was really about just having Internet access,"" says Jaime Perry, vice president of brand and product development at JetBlue. ""But now, we see more demand from customers who have come to expect to have the capability to watch whatever they want, when they want, whether they're at home or flying at 40,000 fleet over the Atlantic Ocean. So we’ve launched partnerships with The Wall Street Journal and Major League Baseball and a bunch of other partners. It allows us to keep refreshing the offering and giving better value to our customers without actually making physical changes to the aircraft, which is the hard part. I expect you’ll see others start to go down that path as well. Put as much hardware on as you can at one go and then leverage software and content in upgrades to customers.""

Long term, Perry wants his airline to continue to invest in onboard hardware and software that facilitates an on-demand cabin experience.

""We’ve made all these enhancements to allow them to watch what they want to watch,” he says, adding that JetBlue is finding some unintended consequences of this offer. “We’re moving toward a world where we have to install in-seat power because everybody using their own devices, which need to be charged,"" says Perry.

""The long term plan is to continue to give customers the ability and the tools to access whatever content they want whenever they want. That’s clearly what people are used to now, and it’s increasingly what they’re coming to expect.""

Hawaiian front cabin in-flight entertainment interface. Hawaiian Airlines

Hawaiian Airlines

Hawaiian is an example of a carrier that has taken strides to incorporate aspects of the region it flies within into its onboard IFE experience. ""We understand why our guests choose us,"" says Reena Awana, senior director for product development at Hawaiian Airlines. ""They choose us to start their Hawaii vacation the moment they get on board. So, working harder to ensure we utilize our IFE systems to the fullest to help accomplish that experience is something we are passionate about doing now and into the future.""

Among the content offered on the AVOD systems are destination videos highlighting places to visit in Hawaii, as well as foreign language movies curated for each country that the airline flies to.

The island carrier's A330s feature their most advanced IFE tech, with embedded touch screens and USB charging ports at every seat. On the 767 fleet, to augment the older style traditional overhead systems, Hawaiian now offers passengers the option to rent Apple iPad minis, which feature on-demand movies, shows and games.

Awana says the airline is also focused on continuing to upgrade its IFE experience with a focus on reducing the number of embedded servers and boxes required to deliver on-demand content.

""The prospect of reducing weight and lowering operating costs while staying at the forefront of innovation is always of interest to us, and streaming solutions can provide those benefits,"" says Awana. ""Another consideration, however, is that the adoption of that technology among our guests is still ongoing, and If a guest is not prepared to use that technology (not aware of the offer or doesn’t have a working device) their in-flight experience is impacted. Properly communicating with guests and preparing them for streaming cabin environments is critical to ensuring consistent and fulfilling IFE offers as a part of the guest experience.""

As the on-demand cabin concept continues to evolve, one of the primary focuses of the suppliers of the hardware and software that powers these capabilities is a move toward a truly wireless cabin environment. Michael Planey, a former American Airlines product manager and U.S. Air Force systems engineer, says that despite the seemingly wireless cabin experience passengers are currently enjoying, the hidden myriad of cabling, wiring and electronic components is the key to providing this new on-demand level of cabin entertainment.

“In a traditional seat-embedded system, there is usually a bank of servers (usually two to six units depending on architecture and redundancy) located in the electronics bay with a content loading portal in a galley or other cabin location. The servers control both the hosting and delivery of content, sent via coaxial, fiber-optic or wireless networks,” says Planey.

Bill Rowell, senior manager of technical sales at Honeywell Aerospace agrees.

“We see the request for a true wireless system,” says Rowell. “Where we have today the ability to wirelessly stream content to your device and wirelessly control the system from your device, what the installers would like to see is they would like the source to send its content to the bulkhead or embedded seat display, where the Blu-ray would be the transmitter and the monitor would be a receiver; because the installers would like to get away from having to run cabling between all the components onboard the airplane.”"
Airbus steps up efforts to recruit talent in China - Global Times,"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL2NvbnRlbnQvOTQxNzg1LnNodG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philippe Pezet, Airbus Group China Vice President Human Resources.

China is poised to become the world's leading country for passenger air traffic, and the market has already become an important region for global aircraft manufacturers.Consequently, recruiting talent in China has become crucial for them to make their businesses more sustainable.Airbus Group, the France-based aircraft manufacturer, and Tsinghua University will launch the 2015 China Summer University event on Monday, as part of Airbus Group's University Partnership Program.The event is the first organized in China since the program's launch in 2014.""Closely cooperating with top-tier universities and building up a good partnership will ensure absorbing more and more talent for our industry in the future,"" Philippe Pezet, Airbus Group China Vice President Human Resources, told the Global Times in an interview earlier in September.Pezet made the remark ahead of the Beijing Air Show, which will open on Wednesday.In July, Airbus signed a framework agreement to set up an A330 Completion and Delivery Center in Tianjin with its Chinese partners. The center will cover aircraft completion activities including reception, cabin installation, aircraft painting, engine runs and flight tests.The plant is expected to create 250 to 300 jobs over the long term.The jobs are part of the company's expansion in China as Airbus said it has about 1,550 employees in the country, including those in Tianjin, Beijing and Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.""We have high standards. We want people who can speak English. We would like to have people with leadership capabilities, and we would like to have people with the potential to grow and to evolve,"" Pezet said.A few of the positions will be occupied by expatriates because a certain number of expatriates will be needed to train the new Chinese employees, Pezet said. Still, expatriates will make up less than 10 percent of the workers at the facility.The average turnover rate at Airbus China was 6-7 percent in 2014, or about half the national average.But Pezet remains unsatisfied with the figure, which is still far higher than Europe's average turnover rate of 2.5 percent. He said a turnover rate of 5 percent ""would be better.""""We are not recruiting people to hold one position for only a few years. We invest in somebody. We will do our best to develop people, to train, to grow. In terms of selection, we are very cautious and very demanding,"" Pezet said.In the next two decades, the average annual growth rate for the domestic Chinese market will be 7.1 percent, though it will grow even faster over the next decade at 8.3 percent on average per year, according to a report released by Airbus in December.The report also said domestic air traffic in China will become the world's highest within a decade.Working for a multinational company means more opportunities to advance, and it is an important measure to keep the talent in the company.Airbus usually first offers these opportunities to employees who have worked at the company for at least five years.The overall goal is for 10 percent of the staff to change jobs every year. That could mean simply changing positions within a division or changing divisions within the group, or even changing the country where they work.""We started at 1 percent, and last year, we did 6 percent. Our objective for 2015 in China is 8 percent,"" Pezet said.However, he said there are lots of obstacles to mobility in China, and accepting geographical mobility is a challenge here. Hukou can be one of constraints on mobility, which is something very specific to China. Europe doesn't have the same constraints.Several years ago, multinationals were seen as desirable places for employees. Nowadays, things are different, as State-owned companies are getting more competitive, and those companies are also in the process of instituting a global management style and offering more and more international positions, which pose a challenge for multinationals in terms of recruitment.""We face some departures, resignations from people who are willing to move to State-owned companies, so it's complicated and more challenging for us,"" Pezet said, though he remains confident the company can attract more people.Still, Pezet worries that very experienced talent is still in short supply in China, as the country's aerospace industry employment market is less mature than that in Europe.""It's kind of a war for getting experienced people due to the pressure and tension on the job market,"" Pezet told the Global Times."
UK MoD To Acquire High-Flying Zephyr 8 UAVs - Defense News,"Wed, 09 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNS8wOS8wOS91ay1tb2QtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS1oaWdoLWZseWluZy16ZXBoeXItOC11YXZzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain's Ministry of Defense will acquire three Airbus-built, solar-powered UAVs that fly on the edge of space , the company said Wednesday.

The Zephyr 8 machines being supplied by Airbus Defence and Space will be capable of flying at a height of about 70,000 feet for up to three months, giving military customers the ability to conduct persistent surveillance or provide communications relays at a fraction of the cost of satellites or manned aircraft and for significantly longer than other unmanned platforms, company executives said.

The British will use the potentially game-changing UAV’s for operational capability demonstrations, including flying two of the machines at the same time, Zephyr business development leader Steve Whitby told reporters during a briefing.

The two sides have inked a memorandum of understanding and are in final negotiations to complete the deal, Whitby said.

Deliveries of the machines, which Airbus call High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites, are expected to take place over the next 15 months to 18 months. The British have already conducted flight tests on an earlier, smaller version of the Zephyr they acquired from Airbus.

The Zepyhr holds the world record for flight duration of 14 days and Whitby said the vehicle comfortably outperforms solar-powered rivals

The Zephyr's batteries are fueled by the sun during the day and stored energy is used during the night to power the machine's two propellers.

The new Zephyr 8 with its 28-meter wingspan covered in solar panels is expected to fly for the first time next summer and is capable of carrying a 5-kilogram surveillance or communications payload. A larger and better performing variant is already on the drawing board. Known for the moment as Zepyhr 9, the vehicle could be ready for flight in about two-and-a-half years, said Airbus executives.

The Zephyr is likely to figure in the work the MoD is doing to update its aging ISTAR asset base as part of the strategic defense and security review expected to be published by the end of the year. Whitby said the British were one of several nations looking at the capabilities offered in the defense and security sectors.

Airbus is discussing with Singapore various launch and landing options for Zephyr including the use of an ""enormous barge."" The two sides are also looking at possible joint development of a Zephyr-specific maritime radar.

The company is also in discussions with the German military and police about studying the communications capabilities of Zephyr and is engaged with the US Department of Defense and other agencies investigating possible use of the vehicle.

Zephyr was originally developed by British company QinetiQ before Airbus purchased the program.

National carrier Air India has got the go-ahead from European aircraft maker Airbus to use three of its ageing A320s for a longer duration, even as the state- run airline is in the process of replacing the entire fleet of these planes with new fuel-efficient aircraft.

The move, which is subjected to DGCA approval, would allow Air India to fly these planes by another one-and half year than mandated operational life, aviation ministry sources said.

Significantly, one of Air India's pilots body, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) had in March this year asked the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ground these more than a two decades old classic A320s, citing safety issues.

""Air India had invited a team from Airbus to inspect these three A320 aircraft and evaluate whether scheduled maintenance period of these planes can be extended. After aircraft stress and structural analysis, Airbus approved aircraft's operational life beyond the scheduled period,"" a source said.

The government-owned airline, however, can fly these planes beyond their operational life once the DGCA approves the same, they said.

The current operational life of an Airbus A320 stands at 48,000 flight cycles and 60,000 flight hours.

Of the 20 A320s in Air India's fleet of 103 planes, six are 26 years old, while seven planes are in service since 21 years. Besides, seven of these planes were manufactured in 1993 while one A320 belongs to 1990, according to the DGCA website.

The A320 plane (VT-ESI), which was involved in an incident at the Delhi Airport early this week was also of 1994 make.

Air India is already in the process of replacing about a third of its narrow-body (A320) planes which are more than 20 years old with new fuel efficient planes.

As part of the plan, the airline has already inducted three sharklets-equipped A320 ceo (current engine option) aircraft in the fleet, of the five such planes, for which it has tied up with the Chinese lessor China Aircraft Leasing Company.

The rest two planes are expected to be delivered by October.

Besides, Air India would dry-lease 14 Airbus A320 planes from a Kuwaiti lessor, which are scheduled to be delivered to Air India between April 2017 and March 2018."

The agreement also includes long-term TotalCare engine service support for the cargo jets.

Airbus senior vice-president, Beluga XL programmes head Bertrand George said: ""We look forward to the Trent 700 powering this important development in our air transport strategy.

""The engine has an excellent record on the A330 and is suited to our requirements for this aircraft.""

Launched in November 2014, the Beluga XL is based on the A330 design. It will serve the A350 XWB ramp-up and transport capacity requirements of other programmes.



""The engine has an excellent record on the A330 and is suited to our requirements for this aircraft.""

The aircraft will feature increased dimensions of 1m-wide and 6m-long, compared with the existing Belugas in operation. It will expand Airbus’ industrial air transport capability by 30%.

The new Beluga fleet will replace the existing aircraft, which will gradually retire by 2025.

Rolls-Royce strategy and future programmes – civil large engines executive vice-president Simon Carlisle said: ""We welcome this decision to select an engine that is the clear market leader on the A330 and offers outstanding performance in terms of fuel burn, reliability, emissions and noise.""

So far, the company’s Trent 700 has logged more than 60% of new orders over the last three years, and more than 1,500 engines are in service or on firm order.

The latest contract comes after Airbus selected Ascent Aerospace for Beluga XL’s final assembly system.

Stelia Aerospace, Aernnova, Deharde, P3 Voith Aerospace, and Aciturri were also awarded contracts to supply aero-structures for the transport aircraft, including fuselage, main cargo door, dorsal fin, and fuselage of the cargo bay.

Monacair has signed an order for six H130s to set up an improved service of regular scheduled flights linking Monaco Heliport to Nice International Airport. The first commercial flight is planned for January 2016 with a flight every 15 minutes.

Specializing in private helicopter management, Monacair has valuable experience in terms of VIP transport and serves customers seeking both personalized and high-quality services. Based in Monaco, the operator manages a fleet of 20 helicopters, half of which are Airbus Helicopters. Thanks to the purchase of these six H130 light helicopters, Monacair will now operate its own helicopter fleet.

“We are really excited with this new challenge and I am sure our customers will appreciate the aircraft’s comfort and high visibility” said Gilbert Schweitzer, managing director of Monacair. “As in all other services proposed by Monacair, we want to offer the best to our clients and the H130 provides a unique travelling experience.”

The H130 comes from the Ecureuil family of light helicopters, renowned for its performance, reliability, safety and multi-mission capability. The helicopter accommodates one pilot and up to six passengers.

“I want to thank Monacair for selecting the H130, which has the largest cabin of any single-engine rotorcraft in the world” said Dominique Maudet, Airbus Helicopters executive vice president for global business and services. “This contract is another step forward in our long-lasting relationship and I am confident that the H130 will provide a superior service and contribute to the success of our customer’s new venture.”"
American Airlines accidentally used the wrong plane to fly to Hawaii - The Verge,"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE1LzkvMTMvOTMyMDA2MS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktdXNlZC10aGUtd3JvbmctcGxhbmUtdG8tZmx5LXRvLWhhd2FpadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This goes without saying, but planes aren't like socks. You can't mix and match them. Each is uniquely identified and has a precise schedule with the airlines. That's why it's pretty shocking to hear that American Airlines used the wrong plane on August 31st to fly over a hundred passengers from LA to Honolulu on flight 31.

Passengers in Los Angeles boarded and took off in an Airbus A321. That's the right model of plane, but it wasn't exactly the right plane. Not only did this A321 have a different tail number from the plane that should have flown the route, but it wasn't certified to fly a long over-water route.

It was an Airbus, but not the right Airbus

Specifically, the A321 variant used by American Airlines lacked ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) from the FAA, according to Brian Sumers, an aviation expert who first reported on the incident. The certification is required for planes with two engines to fly long-range routes far from emergency landing sites — like that from the West Coast to Hawaii. With certain levels of certification, the planes are approved to fly for up to three hours with only a single jet engine in operation. The FAA strictly forbids the use of non-certified planes on such routes.

Although the mixup is an odd one, it may not have been a particularly dangerous one. According to comments from an American Airlines spokesperson, both A321 variants are equipped with similar safety gear, including life rafts. While the equipment on board is similar, Sumers reports that airlines only seek certification for planes that fly extended operation routes since the verification can be time-consuming and costly.

In a statement, airline spokesperson Casey Norton said, ""When we noticed it, we immediately undertook an internal investigation, and we alerted the FAA."" Norton added, ""We are checking our internal procedures, everything that led up to the departure. ... We have gone back and made some changes to software systems.""

It appears American noticed the mixup too late, however: the plane completed its flight to Hawaii instead of rerouting to LA. The plane was then immediately flown back to LA, empty, and the scheduled return flight was canceled."

The mistake, first reported by aviation blogger Brian Sumers, occurred on Aug. 31 — just days after the airline began flying Airbus A321 planes on the L.A. to Hawaii route (other planes in American Airlines' fleet have long flown this route).

A spokesman for the airline confirmed to The Washington Post that a version of the A321 plane that was not certified to make long flights over water — as on the route between Los Angeles and Hawaii — was accidentally flown that day.

The mistake was caught midway through the flight, Sumers reported, but a decision was made to continue to Hawaii. The airline canceled the return flight and the empty plane was flown back to Los Angeles.

“Immediately when we realize what happened, we notified the FAA and we are working and fully cooperating with them,” spokesman Casey Norton said. “We also have an ongoing, thorough review of our policies and procedures.”

Planes that fly routes with no suitable landing areas are required to have a certification called ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) which is primarily an administrative requirement, but it also calls for the planes to be equipped with extra oxygen and a fire suppression cannister.

The A321 planes can be either ETOPS certified or non-ETOPS certified. Both planes have the same number of life vests, rafts, and engine range, Norton said.

According to Sumers, airlines don’t certify all planes, just the ones that are used to fly the long-range routes over water:

Obtaining ETOPs certification is not difficult but it is a complicated process, and so there’s no reason to certify aircraft that won’t fly on long routes over water. As a result, American has two types of A321s in its standard first class and coach configuration — the A321H, which can fly to Hawaii, and the A321S, which cannot.

Yet flying a non-ETOPS certified plane, as American did on Aug. 31, is a big mistake and it is extremely rare, Norton acknowledged.

Sumers, who writes about aviation issues, said that he first learned about the mistake from pilots chatting online anonymously.

“It’s really rare,” Sumers said. “Something like this, when you talk to airline people, they say ‘How does this happen? This can’t happen.’”

American Airlines would not say what caused the mistake. But Norton said that immediately after it occurred, the airline upgraded the software on the plane so that “the correct aircraft is identified to fly the correct route.”"
"Flight Review: British Airways ""Club Europe"" Airbus A320 Paris Orly to London Heathrow. - God Save The Points","Thu, 03 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2NsdWJldXJvcGVyZXZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently tabulated that we’ve earned over a million miles in the last four years. You’ve certainly tabulated that British Airways program has gone through major changes in the last year. While going anywhere far and meaningful in first or business class has all but gone out the window, flying short distances, especially on “off peak” avios mileage deals is a better value than ever. The purpose of reviews like this one are to educate, curb enthusiasm and give the tools necessary to make a decision on whether or not it’s right for you. I redeemed 7,750 “Avios” for a peak at British Airways Club Europe from Paris Orly, the far closer, smaller and better airport to access Paris to London Heathrow. It was simple, it was great and given the value for such few miles I found it tremendous. Just don’t expect a bed or even a great big seat. Oh and since I just got 5,000 miles for my flight from New York it was a very even trade!

Check In

Going carry on, only thanks to Luggage Forwarding, I decided to check in online and skip the priority “Club Europe” line using my mobile boarding pass to head straight for security. If you have bags, the check in can be found by walking further into Terminal Ouest (West) around area C on the left side of the area if facing the gates. Fortunately, Club Europe does involve a fast track and it really came in handy here. There was a terrible line for economy yet it took me only mere seconds to get through. That’s worth more than a little to me.

The Lounge

After a breeze through security I made my way downstairs. They say you build from the ground up and I guess the french builders took it literally. Regardless, I made my way to the British Airways/Open Skies joint lounge. Ok so the entrance probably won’t win any design awards, but the brand new “212” at Orly is a great experience.

The design is inspired by Manhattan loft living with exposed beams, windows that remind me of British Airways first class and nice seating areas.

This particular area reminded me less of New York loft living and more like old style train and rail service with facing seats, large windows and great art. As you’ll see in the next picture, for a loser like me it also provided a great view….

Much to my delight, the lounge was on the ground floor below the main gate area allowing for stunning views of this Air France 777-300 pushing back from the gate. I even got the gate in mid push! Loved it.

Of course, in a lounge most of you are much more concerned with the food and drink offerings than the taxiing planes outside. I was in the lounge during breakfast time and though there were no hot food offerings there were nice pastries, fresh fruit and a great cappuccino maker. I had two cups! Fortunately, my mom and dad were close on my tail and sent me these photos from their time in the lounge on the later afternoon flight. It appears there were nice hot and cold options including pasta as well as high end wine.

Ah the French, they do pastry so well yet manage to be so thin… Bastards.

Thanks Mom for the picture below, looks good to me! Nice to know there is warm food offerings for the lunch/evening time.

The Seat + MEal + Booze

As you may have guessed, business is basically just an economy seat in the front of the cabin with the middle seat blocked out. You can use the middle seat and attachment to store items or get some work done which is handy for some. For a flight of this magnitude I found the seat more than adequate though nothing to smile about like some of these. Because of the brevity of options (none) and flight I chose to lump the review of the seat, food and drink into one section.

I must say I was thoroughly impressed by the amount of service given the one hour or less duration of the flight. For those of you who think British Airways meals are crap, come ride around in the states, dogs eat better! I really enjoyed my cold antipasto breakfast.

And of course the only thing better than breakfast is a champagne breakfast. I just loved the mini bottles!

And the only thing better than reaching your final destination with champagne and coffee is all the above with a fast track ticket through customs.

Celebrities do a terrible job at blending in. Even though I got through immigration very quickly it was my first time entering the UK since applying for Registered Traveller and thus I needed to wait to receive my special card. Fortunately this gave Laura time to spot Chinese mega chef Ken Hom. Who clearly looks like an extra from Men in Black and The Matrix….

The Experience…

I guess the primary question is would I pay cash for this. Unless I was on a very tight schedule or in a major hurry for time I would probably say no. The ability to redeem just 7,750 Avios one way, which carry a cash equivalent of $77 if used towards the price of a paid ticket represents excellent value. For my flights the return price for Club Europe was over $400 meaning I got more than $200 worth of flying for a pittance in miles. If you are mileage rich the upgraded experience from check in through immigration is worth a few extra miles to me, maybe just not a few more dollars.

Flying to the edge of space without an engine is an idea so crazy it might just work - The Washington Post,"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbm5vdmF0aW9ucy93cC8yMDE1LzA5LzI0L2ZseWluZy10by10aGUtZWRnZS1vZi1zcGFjZS13aXRob3V0LWFuLWVuZ2luZS1pcy1hbi1pZGVhLXNvLWNyYXp5LWl0LW1pZ2h0LWp1c3Qtd29yay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Only when you see an image of the Perlan II Glider nestled up alongside a commercial jet airliner is it possible to grasp fully the audacity of what the Perlan II Glider team is attempting to accomplish in 2016. With an 84-foot wingspan, the Perlan Glider fits snugly under a single engine of a commercial airliner. In other words, it’s so tiny that you would never think that it might be able to make it to the edge of space. And, even if it could, would you trust any aircraft that doesn’t come with an engine just in case, you know, something happens? There’s room for a crew of two pilots, some scientific instruments and not much else, so it’s obvious that the Perlan Glider is not the future of commercial aviation as we traditionally think of it. Given the fact that the glider depends on strong air currents to carry it along, it’s subject to weather limitations as well. For example, an earlier launch scheduled for Sept. 16 was scratched due to weather conditions and the Sept. 23 test launch came with the requisite “weather permitting” caveat. However, the Perlan Glider is aiming higher than just setting extreme altitude records. According to the leaders of the Perlan Project, the goal is to contribute to our understanding of modern climate science by looking down on the earth from an unheard-of altitude. At 90,000 feet above the earth, the Perlan Glider would have unique access to scientific research on global climate change and changes to the earth’s ozone layer, which is located at 80,000 to 100,000 feet above the earth. “We’re extremely excited about the successful first flight of the Perlan 2 glider,” said Ed Warnock, chief executive of the Perlan Project. “This marks a major breakthrough in aviation innovation, one that will allow winged exploration of the atmosphere at the edge of space and lead to new discoveries to unravel some of the continuing mysteries of weather, climate change and ozone depletion.” And there are potential applications for the Perlan Glider in developing the future of space exploration. That’s because the conditions in the earth’s stratosphere approximate those on Mars, according to Perlan. The air in the stratosphere is approximately 2 percent as dense as the air found at sea level and comes with temperatures of minus-70 degrees Celsius, comparable to atmospheric conditions on Mars. So, it’s possible to imagine a futuristic scenario in which a similar type of space glider soars across Mars before settling down on the Martian surface to keep future Mars rovers company. Over the next year, the Perlan team (a volunteer-run nonprofit organization supported by Airbus Group) plans a number of other flights and further coordination with climate researchers before the big flight in 2016 at 90,000 feet over Patagonia. In May 2019, the plan is to push the envelope even further, flying at 100,000 feet above the earth’s surface at even higher flight speeds to explore the Polar Vortex. The fact that the Perlan 2 Glider has the backing of Airbus Group should tell you plenty about the high-profile nature of the project. “Airbus Perlan Mission II is a historic endeavor in the truest spirit of aviation’s earliest pioneers,” said Tom Enders, chairman and chief executive of Airbus Group. “The knowledge gained from this project will impact how the world understands and addresses climate change. But it will also help Airbus continue to innovate ways to fly higher, faster and cleaner, on Earth and possibly beyond.”"

"United Unveils New Domestic First Class Seat: Wider, With an iPad Holder - View from the Wing","Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS91bml0ZWQtdW52ZWlscy1uZXctZG9tZXN0aWMtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mtc2VhdC13aWRlci13aXRoLWFuLWlwYWQtaG9sZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United debuted their new narrowbody premium (first class) seat which week starts flying on a single Airbus A319 next week, continuing rolling out across the Airbus fleet in the fall (although the retrofit won’t be completed until 2017), and work will begin on ‘many’ 737s and 757s throughout 2016. It appears that while over 200 planes in United’s fleet will get the new seats not every narrowbody will have it. I assume that has to do with projected retirements from the fleet.

The seat appears to add half an inch of width compared to the current Airbus first class seat, at least that’s my read although United claims the cushion width represents a greater increase than that.

The seat’s tray table has a built-in tablet holder to let you keep working while you eat (hopefully therefore not getting frustrated when flight attendants don’t collect your tray in a timely manner, a reason I sort of got used to bad food on American from September through April since it meant I was more productive).

What I really would like to see is a tray table that pushes out as well as pulls in, and that swivels out so that you can get up from the seat even with a meal still on it.

One change is that when you recline the seat, the cushion moves forward which means it doesn’t take up as much legroom from the passenger in the row behind. That’s how American’s first class seats work on many 737s. The Airbus planes that don’t have a/c seat power get reconfigured first (thank goodness!).

Chris McGinnis says,

The most noticeable feature of the new seat is a granite-topped cocktail ledge on the center console. Designers said that the marble is more like a wafer than a block to keep weight down, but is mounted on a sturdy honeycomb-type material for durability.

There’s storage beneath the arm rest, something I’m also used to on several domestic American planes.

There are no video screens, United is moving to streaming video you can access on your own device. I’m fine with that, it saves the airline money and weight (and therefore fuel). I don’t miss using a seatback screen. My laptop’s battery will last over 8 hours even playing video and without darkening the screen. Not everyone chooses a technology solution meant to power themselves through multiple flights. So it’s good they’ll have a/c power for passengers. (There’s no USB power, however.)"
