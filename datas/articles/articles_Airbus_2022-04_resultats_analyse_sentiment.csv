Airbus and ITA Airways partner to develop urban air mobility in Italy - Airbus,"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNC1haXJidXMtYW5kLWl0YS1haXJ3YXlzLXBhcnRuZXItdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC11cmJhbi1haXItbW9iaWxpdHktaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rome, Airbus and ITA Airways have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on urban air mobility (UAM) in Italy. The two companies will explore the creation of tailored UAM services, by identifying strategic use cases for emission-free mobility solutions.



The agreement foresees a joint approach toward local mobility stakeholders in order to onboard additional partners for the safe and sustainable launch of operations with the CityAirbus NextGen electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, currently in development. The parties also agree to identify pilot cases with the goal of securing public acceptance of UAM by demonstrating the added value that it can bring to communities.



“The partnership between ITA Airways and Airbus started with the evolution toward more modern, more comfortable and environmentally-friendly commercial aircraft, equipped with cutting-edge technologies”, said Alfredo Altavilla, Chairman of ITA Airways. “With this agreement, our partnership expands to the segment of urban air mobility for a wider, customer-centric, innovative and sustainable offer for our customers.” CityAirbus NextGen is a fully electric vehicle equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its uniquely designed distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers - including a pilot - in zero-emission flights for multiple applications. CityAirbus NextGen is being developed to fly with a 80 km operational range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for a variety of missions.



Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, said: “This agreement is testimony to the strong relationship between Airbus and ITA Airways. It is an opportunity to leverage our shared ambition – pioneering sustainable aerospace – and advance new air mobility solutions for zero-emission vertical flight in support of our cities and communities later this decade.”



ITA Airways is the Italian flag carrier airline. It was created in 2021, with sustainability as one of the fundamental pillars of its business plan. The company has shown a keen interest in innovative projects to decarbonise aviation, such as the development of urban air mobility through eVTOLs. ITA Airways recently directly purchased 28 aircraft from the manufacturer, including seven A220s, 11 A320neos and 10 A330neos. The A350 will also join the company’s fleet this summer.



Since 2014, Airbus has been exploring how electric propulsion can help drive the development of new kinds of aerial vehicles. In September 2021, the Company unveiled its fully electric eVTOL prototype, CityAirbus NextGen. Airbus is developing a UAM solution with eVTOLs not only to offer a new mobility service but also as an important step in its quest to reduce emissions in aviation across its product range.

The double-decker airplane took off from Blagnac Airport in Toulouse on March 25.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

According to Airbus, the test flight lasted about three hours and used one Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine that was running on 100% SAF.

The SAF was produced in Normandy and was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids. The fuel was free from aromatics and sulfur and primarily consisted of used cooking oil and other waste fats.

The airline company said a second test flight using the same aircraft took off from Toulouse on March 29 and headed to Nice, where the SAF was tested during the takeoff and landing.

LIGHTNING STRIKES ON AIRPLANES CAN BE SCARY – JUST ASK MILEY CYRUS

""Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry's ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The company claims that using SAF could contribute between 53%-71% of required carbon reductions to meet that goal.

This marks the third successful test flight of an Airbus aircraft flying on 100% SAF over the past year.

The first was an A350 last March, followed by an A319neo single-aisle airplane in October.

The company said all Airbus airplanes are certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene with a goal of achieving certification for 100% SAF by the end of the decade.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9117818474769592}",neutral,0.9117818474769592,0
Airbus Can Meet Production Targets Despite Russian Titanium Constraints - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Tue, 05 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9haXJidXMtY2FuLW1lZXQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi10YXJnZXRzLWRlc3BpdGUtcnVzc2lhbi10aXRhbml1bS1jb25zdHJhaW50cy_SAXZodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWNhbi1tZWV0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdGFyZ2V0cy1kZXNwaXRlLXJ1c3NpYW4tdGl0YW5pdW0tY29uc3RyYWludHMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ plans to aggressively ramp up aircraft production are on track, despite new constraints on the global supply of Russian titanium, a critical metal for aerospace manufacturing.

The European airframer quashed rumors that its A320 and A350 production increases will be delayed by titanium-supply issues. “We continue to assess the impact of the current situation in detail, but we do not see any issue in the short to medium term,” an Airbus spokesperson said. “Regardless, we are accelerating our efforts to secure alternative sources of supply.”

Airbus previously indicated that it sourced as much as half of its titanium needs from Russia. It continues to buy the metal from the country. “Airbus is directly sourcing titanium from Russia as well as from other countries, and indirectly sourcing it from Tier 1 suppliers,” the spokesperson said. “This is done in accordance with all sanctions and applicable export control regulations in place.”

Airbus plans to increase production of its A320 family to 65 aircraft per month by the middle of next year, an aggressive target that analysts and even Air Lease Corp. Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy have questioned. Last year, analysts pointed to other supply chain problems, not least of which were staffing issues at the airframer’s suppliers.

But CEO Guillaume Faury stood by the company’s targets and said Airbus can deliver 20 percent more aircraft this year compared with last year. “We are ready,” he said in February before the conflict began.

Before the war in Ukraine, Russia provided up to 20 percent of the world’s raw titanium, and VSMPO-AVISMA is the world’s largest producer of the metal for the aerospace industry. Before the conflict, Boeing and VSMPO-AVISMA were in a joint venture to provide part of the U.S. airframer’s titanium requirements. But European, Japanese, and U.S. sanctions have prompted aerospace firms to avoid Russian supplies of the metal in order to comply with broader sanctions. China, Japan, Kazakstan, and the U.S. produce the balance of the world’s supply of titanium.

Earlier this year, Boeing CEO David Calhoun assured investors that the company’s supply of the metal was secure. “As long as the geopolitical situation stays tame, no problem,” he said on January 26. “If it doesn’t, we’re protected for quite a while, but not forever.”

But the company started diversifying its supply in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Boeing accelerated the process after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, and has since suspended all titanium purchases from the country.

“Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for airplane production and we will continue to take the right steps to ensure long-term continuity,” a Boeing spokesperson said. “As aerospace is a longer cycle business, we largely have longer-term agreements that bridge short-term supply issues, which give us priority and protection from the fluctuations in the market.”

Embraer sourced much of its titanium from Russia before the war broke out, raising questions about its ability to meet its delivery targets this year. But in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the Brazilian airframer said it had enough supplies for the near term.

“Embraer informs that there is no immediate concern over the availability of titanium in its supply chain, considering its strong current inventory position and the existing contracts for the provision of this material with companies in other countries,” the company said. “Embraer will continue to monitor its supply chain and to seek alternative sources.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9952267408370972}",neutral,0.9952267408370972,0

The scope will include different aspects of the hydrogen supply chain, from the production of hydrogen to its delivery to airports and transfer on-board aircraft.

The MoU was signed at a ceremony in Tokyo, attended by Stéphane Ginoux, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan, and Motohiko Nishimura, Executive Officer and Deputy General Manager of Hydrogen Strategy Division, Kawasaki.

Through this initiative, Airbus and Kawasaki will jointly prepare a roadmap to address challenges and define an advocacy plan on hydrogen aviation needs. Both parties will also pioneer the deployment of a hydrogen infrastructure for aviation with a particular focus on the development of Airport Hydrogen Hubs.

“We are very pleased to work with Japan's leading hydrogen supplier Kawasaki. This partnership will obviously accelerate and promote efforts by the Japanese government to achieve a carbon-neutral, decarbonised society from overall aircraft operations in 2050,” said Stéphane Ginoux. “We strongly believe that the use of hydrogen - both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft - has the potential to significantly reduce aviation's climate impact.”

“Hydrogen is a clean energy that emits no CO2 when used and is suitable as sustainable fuel,” said Motohiko Nishikura. “We have specialised in the development of infrastructure for liquefaction, transportation, storage and transport to receiving terminals, contributing to the construction and expansion of supply chains for the hydrogen market. We are confident that our technology will connect the hydrogen production and consumption areas, creating a new road called Hydrogen Road.”

Each partner will leverage their complementary expertise to help define the potential opportunities that hydrogen offers, and support the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Airbus will provide aircraft characteristics, fleet energy usage, and insight on hydrogen-powered aircraft for ground operations. Kawasaki will provide technology drivers on the various elements of the supply chain while building infrastructure deployment scenarios for the supply of targeted airports.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9859743714332581}",neutral,0.9859743714332581,0

It will bring much emotion to enthusiasts as well as giving them the opportunity to acquire emblematic elements of the jumbo sized Airbus aircraft.

It's a safe bet that amateurs will be thrilled when Maître Marc Labarbe, the auctioneer chosen by Airbus to lead the sale, will auction off an unique item. An element which, without belonging to the aircraft, is an integral part of the A380 legend.

The auctioneer reported: “Someone will have the chance to acquire one of the famous orange suits worn by Claude Lelaie, one of the two pilots who flew with Jacques Rosay during the flight test campaign of the first A380”.

This iconic outfit recalls the extraordinary human adventure of the aircraft's flight test campaign. “From the very first flight, we were able to see that the plane was well conceived and that it had tremendous potential,” said Claude Lelaie.

Although the test programme was carried out smoothly and efficiently, it still reserved a few surprises which were not always very pleasant for the crew. ""It's the very nature of testing!"" said one pilot. “Sometimes things don't go as planned, even on the A380. During the first flight, the landing gear failed to lock. We had to adapt and switch to plan B. During another flight, the temperature dropped to zero degrees in the cabin, enough to cool the engineers who had forgotten their little woollen jackets,” the pilot recalls, good humouredly.

Claude Lelaie agreed to donate his jumpsuit for two reasons.

Firstly, I wanted to make this gesture for the Airbus Foundation, which works in the humanitarian field for the benefit of communities and for the young. This resonates with the educational approach that I carry out with schools, with my books on flight testing in the aeronautical profession.

Secondly, it is my way of paying tribute to all the women and men who have made this fantastic program possible, and in particular the Airbus Flight Test team, which I had the honour of directing and who do a remarkable job.





Claude Lelaie's suit will be offered with nearly 500 A380 parts, the vast majority from the cabin of the A380 MSN013*. The items have been selected for their technological and aesthetic interest and include lamps, a bar, vanes, a mini stick, a staircase, a ramp, trolleys, seats, and even the cockpit's emergency rope.

Cockpit SATCOM - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjItMDQtY29ja3BpdC1zYXRjb23SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pilots and ground staff rely on the cockpit SATCOM as an essential means to communicate. Evolving user requirements and technology have led Airbus to review and update the system.

Today, satellite constellation technology enables more throughput, taking into account regulation requirements and the growing number of customers. However, whilst airlines need and expect more connected IP-based applications, it is fundamental to ensure aircraft systems remain protected.

The Light Cockpit SATCOM (LCS) provides a solution, using IP technology as well as stringent data security barriers in accordance with regulations.

Since the early stages of commercial aviation, and in order to enhance safety, regulations have required long-range communication means for flying over oceanic and remote areas. Initially performed exclusively with HF voice communication, the cockpit SATCOM which operates in the L-band radio frequency is now recognized as an alternative means of communication with the ATC (Air Traffic Control) or AOC (Airline Operation Centre). For continental areas such as Europe, VHF is mainly used thanks to a widely deployed, but increasingly congested, VHF ground network.

Note: cabin SATCOM operates in Ku/Ka band radio frequency.

Typically, thanks to the EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) live weather forecast application, the crew on a transatlantic flight can detect an unexpected approaching storm cell with potential turbulence as a complement to the onboard weather radar. They can then call the ATC using the satellite communication system to get clearance to change the flight plan.

The crew can also use the SATCOM to contact the AOC regarding, for example, an HF system fault message alert during the flight which could impact the next flight dispatch. This enables maintenance teams to be ready to check the fault on arrival and minimise delay.

LEGACY: VHF antenna on left and SATCOM on right

NEW: VHF antenna on left and new Light Cockpit SATCOM (LCS) on right

Ten ways to increase performance and efficiency



Operators equipped with the new Inmarsat LCS - in place of the previous-generation one - will gain:

more protection against cyber attacks

thanks to state-of-the-art data security mechanisms associated to IP technology introduction; faster cockpit connectivity

with up to 200 kbps (compared to 30 kbps provided by previous generation); EFB internet (IP) connectivity for flight crew

enabling uploading of live weather updates and in-flight briefing updates (requires FOMAX communication router option).

As an example, NAVBLUE proposes an Electronic Flight Assistant Mission+ that will take advantage of the full LCS capabilities. On previous generations, ACARS network was used (capable of 30 kpbs). optimised communication costs

by rerouting part of the ACARS traffic over the LCS IP communication channel (FOMAX required).

And the new design means operators will benefit from:

lighter weight - with up to 50kg of weight reduction compared to previous generations; limited drag , thanks to the low profile antenna; lower power consumption - 5 to 6 times less than current SATCOMs; lower maintenance costs , with less equipment as the ELGA antenna integrates a DLNA (Diplexer & Low Noise Amplifier) and a Power Amplifier; an easier, data-loadable system as the unit does not need removing from the aircraft FLS (Field Loadable Software). FLS is retrievable from the AirbusWorld customer portal thanks to the dematerialisation initiative (no more physical media); a common linefit and retrofit solution for the A320, A330 and A350 families. There are also provisions on A320 to allow a later retrofit installation - to address lessors’ configuration needs, for example.

Airbus Customer Support will become the primary interface for operators, instead of going via the supplier, resulting in quicker outage resolution. Airbus will coordinate with all other parties (including the supplier) as required.

LCS simplified system

The new cockpit SATCOM is lighter and brings increased performance, but with a much simpler system composed of:

A computer (SDU), located in the avionic bay, managing all SATCOM functions (operational and maintenance) and ensuring interface with avionics.

A configuration module (SCM / SDU Configuration Module) embedding SIM card, certificates for secured communication with the ground, configuration of the system and the phone directory.

A new generation compact / low profile antenna ensuring communication with satellites integrating also power amplifier, filters and splitters (ELGA).

A single coaxial cable between SDU and Antenna handling power supply, radiofrequency signals, antenna monitoring data and antenna software loading.

How to operate LCS



Flight crew can operate and control LCS with the new radio control means RMP (Radio Management Panel, cf FAST article Cockpit communication - new-generation audio system) or with the legacy MCDU (Multipurpose Control and Display Unit) and ACP (Audio Control Panel), according to aircraft configuration.

LCS flight crew training remains the same as legacy SATCOM implementations.

To operate LCS, airlines need to subscribe to a new service contract with usual Communication Service Providers (CSP), the same actors as for current cockpit SATCOMs.

Data security protection

As LCS is introducing IP connectivity, security architecture functions & mechanisms are embedded in order to protect the aircraft against cyber attacks:

Physical and logical segregation between each aircraft domain ACD (Aircraft Control Domain / safety cockpit communication), AISD (Aircraft Information Services Domain / non-safety cockpit communication);

Guaranteed Integrity of safety communication (ACD);

A shared security barrier (on aircraft and on ground gateway), based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) mutual authentication and VPN (Virtual Private Network) tunnel, is implemented to complement the ground security barrier managed by the satellite service provider;

Filtering communication coming from the ground via Firewall.

The LCS flight test campaign

During the development phase of the LCS, flight tests were conducted on several Airbus aircraft types. More than 70 hours of dedicated flight were performed. The objective was mainly to check the correct behaviour of the SATCOM interconnected to the avionics, ensure there was no interference with other Communication/Navigation/Surveillance systems, evaluate the end-to-end connectivity performance through satellite space and also the ground segment during all phases of flight and all flight envelope of the aircraft. Flight crew workload and Human Machine interface were also evaluated.

Jim FAWCETT, Lead Flight Test Engineer and specialist in communications systems describes the experience: “We operated our flight test aircraft throughout the whole of the flight domain to ensure good SATCOM coverage even in case of manoeuvring. To ensure good geographical coverage and correct voice and data service behaviour at satellite handover boundaries, we even operated our A350 on a 12-hour flight from Toulouse in France to Gander in Canada and back, without landing! Our crews found the HMI (Human Machine Interface) intuitive and easy to use. The system behaved well and should provide a secure solution for our customers in the years ahead.

LCS and regulations

This new system is compliant with the following regulations:

CAAC AOC voice communications connection within 4 mn requirement

RCP240 and RSP180 for North Atlantic, South Pacific and Y1, Y2, Y3, & L888 routes in China

FANS 1/A

AC 20-150B - Airworthiness Approval of Satellite Voice (SATVOICE) Equipment supporting Air Traffic Service Communication

Aircraft normal tracking ICAO recommendation through AOC

LCS Inmarsat has been designed to be compliant with up-to-date EUROCAE and ARINC standards

Understanding end-to-end satellite communication

SATCOM enables aircraft to exchange information with ground end users, typically ATC and AOC. Communication can be done either by voice or datalink means using IP network layer communication protocol.

Exchanges with ATC are essential to prevent collisions, ensure and optimize the traffic in controlled airspace. Aircraft automatically report their position (ADS-C) and also exchange data via pre-formatted messages (CPDLC) to allow controllers to safely guide aircraft to their destination (routine operations). Both functions are part of FANS application (FANS 1/A in oceanic and remote areas). Flight crew can contact or be contacted by ground control by voice means (SATVOICE function) in distress, emergency or flight safety situations (non-routine operation). Such communication exchanges supporting safe operation of aircraft are part of the “Aircraft Control Domain”(ACD). These critical communications must demonstrate minimum end-to-end performance known as PBCS (Performance-Based Communication and Surveillance). PBCS defines a minimum performance to allow an aircraft to use optimized routes (therefore allowing fuel savings).

Exchanges with AOC allow airlines to support aircraft operational efficiency. It is part of Airline Information Services Domain (AISD). Aircraft can receive and send preformatted automatic maintenance reports via the ACARS network. To support flight operations, crews can request weather data updates during flight to optimize flight path while ensuring passenger comfort (cf FAST article EFB - the new standard). Aircraft also send maintenance reports to the ground automatically, in order to anticipate dispatch and maintenance activities after landing. Voice calls offer also the possibility for pilots to exchange operational information complementary to ACARS with their airline control centers.

Passenger Information and Entertainment Services Domain (PIESD) encompasses all passenger services, mostly known as IFE (In-Flight Entertainment) and includes video streaming, passenger internet and intranet browsing, access to social media... This domain is today handled by cabin SATCOM (average throughput 20/30 Mbps) but cockpit SATCOM with cabin capability can fulfil it (throughput <1 Mbps) for basic need and/or as a backup for cabin SATCOM means.

All cockpit communications to/from aircraft are routed through Satellite Service Providers (SSP) infrastructures (Satellite, Gateway/GES). Today two SSP are recognised to be used by commercial aviation to exchange aircraft cockpit data with ground users: Inmarsat and Iridium.



Then depending on the communication domain they are routed from SSP gateways to ground end users in the following way:

via Communication Service Providers (CSP) to end users Air Traffic Control (ACD) or Airline Operation Centers (AISD) that relay communications in a secure way while ensuring performance. Two CSP are today recognised to be used by Commercial aviation to exchange Aircraft Cockpit data with ground users ATC/AOC : Collins Aerospace (formerly ARINC) and SITA



directly to the Internet network for PIESD.

The LCS relies on the Inmarsat L-Band satellite constellation (today ensured by four I-4 satellites, to be complemented and superseded tomorrow by I-6 ELERA satellites network operating in geostationary orbit) using SB-Safety 2.0 services.

Inmarsat site https://www.inmarsat.com/en/solutions-services/aviation/services/sb-s.html

Next steps

The next Inmarsat LCS evolution under development is FANS C over SATCOM (FAST article FANS C - on page 34). This future capability will enable the use of SATCOM for ATC datalink communications over ATN (Aeronautical Telecommunication Network). It will provide an alternate means to alleviate the European VHF datalink network, expected to be saturated in the near future, especially in high density areas, mitigating the risks of quality degradation of datalink services for ATC and AOC. FANS C over SATCOM will enter into service on A320 and A330 aircraft families and will be capable of 4D Trajectory Based Operations(new mandate from 2028).

The LCS proposes a light and efficient SATCOM solution. Beyond standard SATCOM voice and datalink usage, the LCS will unlock the use of new connected applications such as Mission+ from NAVBLUE (an Airbus subsidiary). Airlines will have new means to optimize their operations.

It provides a high data security level, with reduced maintenance costs and power consumption. It is designed for easy upgrades.

Operators started flying with the LCS at the end of 2021 on both A330 and A320 Family aircraft. It is now offerable to airlines for the A350, with entry into service planned in 2023.

The freighters are destined to increase Air France’s cargo capacity with the most efficient and sustainable cargo aircraft available in the market.

The A350F is based on the world's most modern long range leader, the A350. The aircraft will feature a large main deck cargo door and a fuselage length optimised for cargo operations. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials resulting in a 30 tonnes lighter take-off weight, which together with efficient Rolls-Royce engines generate an advantage of at least 20% lower fuel burn and CO2 over its current closest competitor. With a 109 tonnes payload capability (+3t payload / 11% more volume than its competition), the A350F serves all cargo markets (Express, general cargo, special cargo…) and is in the large freighter category the only new generation freighter aircraft ready for the enhanced ICAO CO₂ emissions standards.

“Airlines now have a choice, and we salute Air France joining those going for the A350F’s step change in efficiency and sustainability for the cargo operations of the future. We are gratified by the wave of early adopters who, like Air France, see the economics and environmental signature of the A350s as standing out versus alternatives, past, existing and future. Merci Air France.” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

Launched in 2021, the A350F recorded 29 orders and commitments from five customers.

Compiling and analysing data on the incidents and accidents which occur contribute to continuously improving the safety of our products, by identifying trends and bringing out links between causes and consequences.

The latest edition of the Statistical Analysis of Commercial Aviation Accidents published annually,provides a rich source of information in this area. Focusing on Western built jets over 40 seats, it firstly highlights that with around 22 million flight departures in 2021, the number of flights remained 40% lower than in 2019 before the pandemic, when almost 36 million flights were registered.

The analysis also points out that 2021 was a year that reported one of the lowest number of accidents. Five of these were registered, one less than in 2020. “This is a slight improvement when compared to the previous years, which indicates the industry's resilience to maintain a level of safety despite the challenges of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. However, with the number of flights still lower than pre-pandemic levels, it is not possible to say if it shows a sustained improvement of the overall safety performance”, the document reads.

Increase the resilience of the entire air transport system

The statistics also show that the majority of flights in service are operating the latest and safest fourth generation aircraft. Comparing accident rates by generation of aircraft clearly illustrates the value of the investments made through technology to improve safety.

The document also underlines that the industry has evolved significantly since the earliest days of commercial aviation, continuously improving the level of safety, especially over the past 20 years. This is reflected in how the industry manages security risks and the health on board for everyone flying today. Ensuring all safety, security, quality and sanitary threats are managed with a prevention mindset, applying lessons learnt, which will increase the resilience of the entire air transport system when facing any future crisis or challenges across the air transport system.

“This encouraging evolution of accident statistics illustrates that individual and collective efforts are paying off. It is all about making sure we permanently reinforce our safety culture”, says Yannick Malinge, Chief Product Safety Officer for Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Roger Béteille: from Pilot to Airbus Founding Father - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vcm9nZXItYmV0ZWlsbGUtcGlsb3QtYWlyYnVzLWZvdW5kZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Roger Béteille: from Pilot to Airbus Founding Father

DALLAS – Roger Béteille is considered the mastermind behind the major developments that made Airbus the world’s largest commercial airframer.

Béteille was born in Aveyron, France in 1921 and studied at Supáero in Toulouse before joining SNCASE in 1943, known as Sud-Aviation. By 1945, he had received his pilot’s license, before becoming a flight test engineer for Sud in 1952, being on the test team for the Caravelle’s first flight.

The Airbus A300B was launched in 1969. In July 1967, an idea to develop a 300-seater all-new widebody jet came to fruition: Mr. Béteille was appointed as the chief engineer for the A300 program at Sud-Aviation. However, launch customers Lufthansa (LH) and Air France (AF) opted for a smaller plane. So, in 1968, Béteille started working in secret on what would become the A300B.

The A300B then came along, a 250 seater with a hold large enough to accommodate two standard containers side by side. The innovative fuselage cross-section he designed is still in use today on the A330. But more was to come from Béteille.

The Creation of Airbus Industrie

At the turn of the decade, Béteille and the first production director of Airbus, Felix Kracht, drew up the workshare, which is what we see today as the Airbus European Production System that is still used by the company. At the time, Béteille said, “I wanted to use all the available talents and capacities to their utmost without worrying about the color of the flag or what language was spoken.”

Through this workshare and the grouping of economic interests, Airbus Industrie was created in 1970, with Béteille becoming the new senior vice president of engineering. Béteille pushed for the headquarters of Airbus to be close to the Toulouse Final Assembly Line so then customers could see the aircraft in production.

1972 saw the first flight of the A300B take place. Even during the OPEC Oil Crisis in the 1970s, Béteille’s understanding of global customers enabled the securing of its first U.S. customer, Eastern Airlines, in 1977.

To the understanding of customers, Béteille was never the one for optimism or confidence. “I was convinced that Airbus would never take off with a single aircraft. Potential customers would wonder if we’d still be around in ten or 20 years’ time.”

In 1984, Béteille achieved his lifelong dream of managing the formal launch of the A320.

A Visionary at Airbus

The reason why Béteille was a visionary at Airbus was because of his instrumental input into the famous Fly-By-Wire (FBW) controls that we see today.

Fly-By-Wire increased flight safety and also began the process of cockpit commonality and cross-crew qualification for pilots, which is something that Airbus continues to boast about today.

In 1985, Béteille’s career at Airbus came to an end by retiring as the company’s president. In line with the A350XWB launch in 2012, the final assembly line in Toulouse was named in his honor as the aircraft still uses the systems he introduced over 30 years ago.

Legacy

Béteille’s success with the use of Fly-By-Wire has enabled Airbus to secure a significant backlog of 7,023 jets (March 2022), of which 6,357, or 91%, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family, all of which use FBW. In February, the company said it expected to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2022, up from 611 in 2021, after announcing a record net profit for 2021.

Without this system and the benefits that came with it, Airbus may not have thrived as well as it has done in the last two decades.

As we celebrate World Pilots’ Day, Airways remembers Béteille not only as the visionary that he was, but as the person that spearheaded the success that Airbus currently enjoys.

Airbus Helicopters: Safety is an unwavering priority - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1zYWZldHktaXMtb3VyLXVud2F2ZXJpbmctcHJpb3JpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helicopters perform essential missions daily, and we at Airbus Helicopters are constantly innovating the technologies of tomorrow — to reduce the carbon footprint of our products, to make them safer and easier to maintain, and to expand our customers’ mission capabilities.

At this year’s Heli-Expo 2022 in Dallas, Texas, attendees saw first-hand our latest products and services and learned about how we are pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world. Showgoers were able to visit the H160, alongside the emergency medical services market leader H135, the versatile H125, and the best-selling ACH145.

A major milestone for the H160 was achieved in December 2021 when the world’s first H160 was delivered to Japanese operator All Nippon Helicopter. In addition, this next-generation multi-role helicopter recently saw its first law enforcement customer, the French Gendarmerie Nationale, with an order of 10 helicopters — the first of which will be delivered in 2024 prior to the Olympic Games in Paris.

The H160 will become a versatile workhorse for operators, and is also a flagship aircraft for Airbus Helicopters’ decarbonization roadmap, as its Safran Arrano engines provide a 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption.

Another important part of our decarbonization strategy is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that is derived from waste material. The majority of Airbus helicopters are certified to fly with a 50 percent blend of SAF, which represents a 40 percent reduction of emissions.

We launched a flight campaign in November 2021 with 100 percent SAF powering one of the H225’s two engines, an important step toward certifying the use of SAF blends that exceed today’s 50 percent limit. In order to accelerate the use of biofuels, we launched a SAF user group for those in the rotary-wing industry who are interested in developing the use of SAF to join forces in accelerating its implementation in the industry.

On the innovation front, we also began in-flight tests on our Flightlab, the platform-agnostic flying laboratory aimed at testing and maturing techno-bricks, such as the engine back-up system (EBS), that will equip future fleets. The EBS can provide electrical power for 30 seconds in the event of engine failure and is a key first step toward a future hybrid propulsion system, as well as a safety enhancer by allowing a smoother autorotation maneuver to the ground.

Another safety feature that Flightlab is testing is health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS). HUMS can provide advanced detection of any technical issues on the helicopter, easing aircraft maintenance and enhancing flight safety.

Among the disruptive technologies tested on Flightlab, multiple solutions are designed to be applicable to eVTOLs. CityAirbus NextGen, Airbus’ fully electric prototype, is currently in a detailed design phase, in order to provide communities and citizens with an urban air transport service this decade. With a maiden flight planned in 2023, Airbus has started to partner with a selection of suppliers to develop the aircraft’s components, such as Thales and Diehl who will provide CityAirbus NextGen’s flight control computers.

On the support and services side, we continue to adapt and improve our offerings to better meet the unique demands of our customers and their missions, wherever they operate. The former HCare Easy, HCare Smart, and HCare Infinite have been replaced by a new structure.

This restructuring simplifies the customer’s choice of support and services with a new flexible, customer-centric approach. Each pillar is aligned with a stage of the customer journey, and packages together the optimal group of support and services for each stage, which could be upon aircraft acquisition, or several years after a fleet enters service.

The HCare First package will still be available for specific fleets of Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) aircraft, and HCare Classics for the serialized legacy fleet (H120, Dauphin, Puma, and Gazelle). Retrofits and upgrades continue to add value — not only can they extend the service life of legacy aircraft, but they can also give the current range a boost. A case in point: the H125 power upgrade increases the single-engine bestseller’s power by up to 10 percent, making full use of the engine’s available power.

In the private and business sectors, ACH continues to meet the needs and tastes of the most discerning customers. It’s where world-class aeronautical engineering expertise meets design values centered on comfort, aesthetics, and a concentration on satisfying individual customer requirements.

ACH proposes tailored and refined interiors and innovative solutions. The concept is crystallized particularly clearly with in-house designs, such as ACH Line and ACH Exclusive, and through partnerships with luxury automobile manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz and Aston Martin. The eight-passenger ACH145 Mercedes-Benz style interior offers extraordinary comfort with an underlying energy. The partner companies have just signed a renewal of their relationship, and a facelift of the helicopter is already underway to further reflect contemporary design values.

The ACH130 Aston Martin edition — a product of a cooperation between ACH and Aston Martin Lagonda — is lean, elegant, and at the sportier end of the Airbus range. It has proven a remarkable success and encapsulates the sheer pleasure and freedom that helicopter flying can bring.

Look out this year for the entry into service of the ACH160, bringing to the corporate marketplace the comfort and enhanced safety features of the most technologically advanced helicopter in service today.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9994199275970459}",positive,0.9994199275970459,1

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd is set to announce a landmark order for Airbus SE A350-1000 jets capable of nonstop flights from Sydney to London as part of a wider deal with the European planemaker, industry sources told Reuters.

The multibillion-dollar order, to be unveiled in a Sydney airport hangar on Monday, brings the Australian carrier a step closer to launching record-breaking direct flights of nearly 20 hours on the lucrative ""Kangaroo route"" by mid-2025.

Qantas has touted plans for the world's longest commercial flights for more than five years, but delayed its ""Project Sunrise"" due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The deal is a breakthrough for veteran Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce who has described nonstop Sydney-London flights as the Holy Grail for the 101-year-old carrier.

The Australian airline launched the route in 1947 with Lockheed Constellations, when it took several stops and 58 hours of flying. Today's one-stop flights take almost 24 hours.

The expansion comes days after Boeing Co further delayed development of its 777X jetliner, which had at one stage been in contention to allow direct flights from Australia's east coast to London and New York.

An Airbus-owned A350-1000 was flying on Sunday from Toulouse to Perth, tracking service FlightRadar24 showed.

Qantas, which has said it would make a significant announcement on Monday about the future of its network, declined to comment. Airbus also declined to comment.

On Sunday, the West Australian newspaper said, without citing sources, that the Qantas order would include 12 A350s, 20 A321XLRs and 20 A220s as well as purchase rights for 106 more airplanes spread among the different types.

Qantas in December selected Airbus as the preferred supplier for a major order to renew its ageing narrowbody fleet, in a blow to its incumbent supplier Boeing.

An airBaltic A220 was parked in Sydney on Sunday, FlightRadar24 showed. That destination is not on a normal route for the European carrier. Australia has no A220 operators at present.

Air France-KLM, has an option for four additional aircraft, said the A350 freighters are needed to meet growing demand for cargo lift. They will be based at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, where Air France-KLM has a 150,000-square-foot global cargo hub. The airline currently operates two Boeing 777 freighters and utilizes the belly capacity of more than 100 widebody passenger aircraft for cargo.

Air France-KLM’s familiarity with the A350 played a big role in its decision. The order comes with full substitution rights to Airbus A350 passenger aircraft, which constitute the new flagship of Air France’s long-haul fleet. The airline currently operates 15 A350s and has another 23 on order.

“This order embodies Air France-KLM’s determination to strengthen its position on the buoyant cargo business,” said CEO Benjamin Smith. “The Airbus A350 passenger version has been instrumental to the improvement of our economic and environmental performance, while proving to be a passenger’s favorite. We are thrilled to be among the launch customers of its freighter version, which will significantly increase our capacity and give us the means to continue to provide the best service to our customers around the world.”

To kick off our return journey to the United States, we flew SWISS business class from Geneva to Frankfurt on the Airbus A220 (one of my favorite planes). Let’s take a look at what that experience was like.

How I booked our SWISS business class tickets

I booked our flight from Geneva to Frankfurt as a separate ticket from our Singapore Airlines flight from Frankfurt to New York the following day. Specifically, I booked the following in business class for 15,000 Aeroplan points plus $64.30 per person in taxes & fees:

04/06 LX1086 Geneva to Frankfurt departing 6:45PM arriving 7:55PM

Admittedly this is a short flight, so some might not find it worthwhile to redeem for business class (I booked business class largely because I wanted to review it). In this case, Aeroplan would have charged 7,500 points for economy class, so the price was double.

Aeroplan points are easy to come by, as the program partners with American Express Membership Rewards, Capital One, and Chase Ultimate Rewards. On top of that, in the United States, there’s the new Aeroplan® Credit Card (review), which is pretty lucrative.

SWISS business class boarding

In the last installment I reviewed the SWISS Senator Lounge Geneva. Our flight was departing from gate D25, which is about as far from the security checkpoint as you can get.

Terminal at Geneva Airport (GVA)

This is a unique setup, as it’s essentially a circular terminal without jet bridges. Rather planes are parked outside with stairs, and you can walk right up to them. It’s kind of a cool view with the floor-to-ceiling windows, if you ask me.

Terminal at Geneva Airport (GVA)

Boarding for our 6:45PM flight started at 6:20PM, with business class passengers being invited to board first. It was just a short walk from the terminal to the aircraft’s stairs.

The A220 is such a gorgeous plane, and I loved the opportunity to walk right up to it.

SWISS A220 business class cabin & seats

We were flying on a SWISS Airbus A220-100, which is the smaller of the two A220 variants. The SWISS A220 features 125 seats, spread across 25 rows in a 2-3 configuration. Not only does the A220 cabin feel incredibly modern and spacious, but you’ve gotta love the 2-3 layout from a passenger comfort standpoint, since there’s only one middle seat per row.

As is standard on intra-Europe flights, economy and business class seats are identical, so the difference just comes down to seat blocking. On this particular flight, the first eight rows of the plane were business class.

I assigned us seats behind one another on the left side. Since intra-Europe business class ordinarily has a blocked middle seat, this works out particularly well on the A220, as you get the set of two seats to yourself. So I had seats 7A & 7C, while Ford had seats 6A & 6C.

SWISS A220 business class seats

On the right side of the plane there are three seats, so in business class the center seat is blocked.

The A220 just feels so sleek across the board, including the seat backs.

While the A220 is somewhere between your typical regional jet and your typical mainline jet, the overhead bins are a good size, big enough for a standard carry-on.

SWISS A220 overhead bins

The seatback had a literature pocket and two pouches, which could be used for a water bottle, a pair of glasses, a smartphone, etc. (though on my seat, one of the pouches was missing). Then there’s the tray table, which folds out from the seatback.

Another nice feature of the Airbus A220 is the windows, which are quite large, bigger than you’d find on a standard jet.

I also love the overhead consoles on the A220, which have reading lights, individual air nozzles, and even small screens that show the safety video and a flight map.

Now, while SWISS’ Airbus A220 cabins are modern, there are two major downsides:

SWISS doesn’t have power ports on Airbus A220s

SWISS doesn’t have Wi-Fi on Airbus A220s

Both of these are standard amenities on newly delivered jets nowadays. In fairness, this isn’t an issue on a 55 minute flight from Geneva to Frankfurt. I’d consider this more of an issue on a longer flight, though.

This flight was mostly full in both business class and economy class. Of the 24 business class seats, only three were empty.

SWISS A220 business class cabin

Waiting at each seat upon boarding was a bottle of water plus a refreshing towel.

There was also a lavatory at the front of the cabin, which was spacious and nicely appointed (and so much nicer than the new lavatories you’ll find on many 737s).

SWISS departure from Geneva

At 6:35PM boarding was complete, and at that point, the captain made his welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 55 minutes. A couple observations:

All announcements were made in French, then English, and then German

Why do PAs on the A220 consistently sound like someone is talking in your ear? They’re so clear and crisp yet loud

At 6:40PM the main cabin door was closed, and at that point the cabin manager made her welcome aboard announcement. At 6:45PM we started our engines and began our taxi (A220 engines are so loud and whiny when starting up). Due to how the stands at this part of the terminal are positioned, there’s no need to push back, but rather you can just taxi straight ahead.

We taxied fast, but nonetheless it took quite some time to get to the runway.

About 10 minutes later (at 6:55PM), we were short of runway 22, where we were cleared for takeoff.

We had beautiful views of Geneva on our climb out…

We hit some pretty serious chop after departure, given the thick clouds combined with the mountains. In particular, we hit one pretty big air pocket that made some passengers gasp.

Fortunately it was a totally different story above the clouds, and about 10 minutes after takeoff the ride smoothed out, at which point the seatbelt sign was turned off.

Once the sign was off, the crew first closed the curtains between cabins, and a few moments later, service began.

SWISS business class snack service

About 20 minutes after takeoff a light snack was served. There were no choices, but rather each passenger was offered a tray with two finger sandwiches (one had pork and cheese, while the other had beets… I think?), plus a dessert with a berry compote and crumble. It wasn’t much of a snack, especially since I don’t eat pork.

A separate cart was then brought out with drinks. I had a coffee and a sparkling water.

After that, chocolates were distributed, as is standard on SWISS.

The crew was friendly and efficient, and was quick to clear service items as people finished up.

SWISS arrival in Frankfurt

20 minutes before landing, the first officer informed us that we were starting our descent to Frankfurt and should be landing at 7:50PM. It was a beautiful evening above the clouds, and it was nice to still see some sunshine.

Just as on departure, it was a different story under a layer of clouds, though. Not only was the sun setting, but it wasn’t particularly clear evening either.

We ended up touching down in Frankfurt at 7:50PM.

Landing at Frankfurt Airport (FRA)

From there we had a literally one minute taxi to our remote stand, which might be a new record for me.

Taxiing at Frankfurt Airport (FRA)

While I usually am not a fan of remote stands, I was impressed that there was a separate bus for business class passengers, so there was no long wait for the bus to fill up, and for that matter people weren’t crammed in the bus either.

A few minutes later we found ourselves in the terminal. We just had to wait for our checked bag, which showed up within about 20 minutes.

Bottom line

The Airbus A220 is a joy to fly, as it’s such a comfortable and spacious jet. In particular, you’ve gotta love the 2-3 layout, since in intra-Europe business class it means you can have both an aisle and window seat to yourself.

This flight was punctual, and the crew was friendly. My only real criticism is that SWISS hasn’t really invested in the passenger experience of these planes beyond the features of the A220 as such. There are no power ports and no Wi-Fi. That’s not at all an issue for such a short flight, but on a longer flight it would be a different story.

DALLAS – Latvia’s national carrier, airBaltic (BT), has received its 34th A220-300. BT is currently the world’s largest operator of the type.

YL-ABH is the second of eight A220-300 planes scheduled for delivery to BT in 2022. The airline anticipates having 50 A220s by 2024. Furthermore, the carrier has the option to purchase an additional 30 A220 jets.

Currently, the Airbus A220 is the greenest commercial aircraft in the world, as it is the first aircraft to have a transparent declaration of the life-cycle environmental impact, helping to reduce CO 2 and NOX emissions by 20% and 50% respectively.

Wet-leasing Part of Its A220 Fleet

After being forced to halt operations in Ukraine and Russia due to the ongoing war, BT announced on April 14 that it would wet-lease 11 of its A220s to other airlines for the summer of 2022.

The Latvian airline has already inked contracts for nine A220s to be leased to Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) and Eurowings on an ACMI basis. BT is also in the midst of signing wet-lease agreements for two other aircraft that have been released from Ukrainian and Russian destinations.

Qatar suffers setback in plane dispute with Airbus - Al Jazeera English,"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzQvMjYvcWF0YXItc3VmZmVycy1zZXRiYWNrLWluLWFpcnBsYW5lLWRpc3B1dGUtd2l0aC1haXJidXPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvNC8yNi9xYXRhci1zdWZmZXJzLXNldGJhY2staW4tYWlycGxhbmUtZGlzcHV0ZS13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Judge rejects Qatar’s argument that it could not obtain similar aircraft to make up the shortfall in A321neo supply.

A British judge denied a request by Qatar Airways to force Airbus to keep building A321neo jets for the Gulf airline, in a setback to the carrier amid a wider aeroplane dispute that has triggered a major falling out in United Kingdom courts.

Tuesday’s decision means the world’s largest planemaker is free to market the in-demand jets to other airlines while the two sides pursue a separate dispute over the safety of larger A350 jets.

Airbus revoked the A321neo deal in January in retaliation for Qatar’s refusal to take A350s in their core dispute over damage to the painted protective layer of the larger jets.

The judge rejected Qatar’s argument that it could not obtain similar aircraft to make up the shortfall in A321neo supply, for example by turning to the leasing market or by deploying 737 MAX jets that it has provisionally ordered from Boeing.

The decision does not rule out Qatar reinstating the contract at a fuller trial, but means the cost of filling any gap between now and then can only be addressed by financial damages rather than forcing Airbus to build its customised jets.

A hearing in London’s High Court was expected to turn later on Tuesday to the timing of what amounts to a widely watched corporate divorce trial, despite what some sources described as a glimmer of hope of an eventual settlement.

The knock-on decision to cancel the A321neo deal alarmed some airlines, with the head of the International Air Transport Association describing it as a “worrying” development in a corner of the market where Airbus enjoys the bulk of new orders.

The head of Dubai’s Emirates airline has said he is “not unsympathetic” to its main Gulf rival over the A321neo fallout.

Grounded A350s

Airbus says the two contracts are connected by a “cross-default” clause that allows it to pull the plug on one deal when an airline refuses to honour the other.

It has accused Qatar Airways, the A350’s biggest customer, of airing invalid safety concerns to avoid taking jets at a time of weak demand, and to activate a $1bn compensation claim.

Qatar says it was right to stop taking A350 deliveries over what it describes as genuine safety concerns by Doha’s regulator over gaps or corrosion in a sublayer of lightning protection left exposed by cratered paint on more than 20 grounded A350s. It says the cross-default clause does not in any case apply.

Airline officials worry the A321neo case may set a precedent allowing disputes to ricochet from one contract to another, tightening the grip of plane giants Airbus and Boeing.

“People will look at this and take extra care to resist such cross-default clauses,” the head of a large airline fleet said.

Backed by European regulators, Airbus denies any A350 safety flaws, though it has acknowledged that paint peeling is a feature of modern carbon jets, requiring repainting more often.

Qatar Airways says the problem of decaying paint, and the resulting exposure of anti-lightning mesh surrounding the carbon fuselage, results from a defect in the plane’s design.

A Reuters investigation in November revealed the problem affected other carriers though apart from Qatar none has taken planes out of service, except for surface repairs.

The court battle has punctured the secrecy surrounding more than a decade of aircraft negotiations and taken the lid off closely guarded planning methods inside the global jet industry.

Multiple industry sources say it is in neither side’s interest to spark a full-scale trial, producing a flood of further disclosures and testing relations between France and Qatar at a time when Europe urgently seeks new gas supplies.

While neither side has closed the door to a negotiated settlement, Tuesday’s lawyer-packed hearing reflected the gloves-off nature of the row, as one of aviation’s pivotal business relationships unravels in London’s High Court.

The airline was ordered to pay most of Airbus’s costs on the A321neo part of the case.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8953308463096619}",neutral,0.8953308463096619,0

The entity — Airbus’s dedicated private and business aviation (PBA) helicopter brand — revealed the figures as it prepares to mark its fifth anniversary at EBACE, having been established at the event in 2017.

Its launch mirrored that of sister fixed-wing brand Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) in 2012.

“What we decided to do five years ago, based on the experience also of ACJ, was to say ‘OK, we want to approach these specific clients of Airbus in a different way,’ ” said Frederic Lemos, head of ACH, at a pre-EBACE briefing.

“Eighty percent of the PBA clients are private individuals, so they don’t have the same expectations [as business customers],” he continued. “They don’t have the same understanding, sometimes, of aviation; they are very demanding; they want to customize. They are not just buying an aircraft, they are buying an asset for their lifestyle, an extension of their lifestyle. What is the helicopter is going to bring me? How easy is it to deal with Airbus? . . . . It is everything that we are bringing behind the scenes to make the experience a very nice experience for our customers and delivering to the promise. And I think, at the end, yes, it’s paying off — it’s paying off in the numbers.”

In its first year, ACH received orders for 53 aircraft, with the following years bringing 68, 66, and 62 orders, respectively.

Lemos said the growth in sales in 2021 was part of an overall market rebound, but also a result of “planting seeds” and “delivering on our commitments.” He then highlighted the importance of the brand’s success in the intermediate single market segment. There, it recorded 68 orders in 2021: 30 ACH125s and 38 ACH130s.

“In this specific market segment, we are very strong, because not only do we have two products, but we have two very strong products,” he said. “We have a lot of owner-pilots in that category of segment, who find themselves more happy flying a 125/130 with all their friends looking in the same direction [with theater-style seating]. The aircraft is very friendly; it’s very fun to operate. The ecosystem [to support and operate it] is everywhere in the world, more or less.”

In January 2020, ACH launched the “Aston Martin Edition” for the ACH130 — a special edition of the type, equipped with a range of four interior and exterior designs created by Aston Martin. ACH has already sold 14 of these, and delivered six. An ACH130 Aston Martin Edition will be the centerpiece of ACH’s display at EBACE, where it will be joined by an Aston Martin car.

The 2021 sales also included nine ACH135s and 13 ACH145s. Lemos highlighted the successful entry into service of the five-bladed version of the ACH145, which will be available for a demonstration flight for prospective customers at EBACE.

Like the ACH130, the ACH145 is available in two versions: the standard “ACH Line” (a fully customizeable catalog offering); and the ACH145 Mercedes Benz Edition. Lemos said the latter will be receiving a “facelift” that will be available to market in 2023.

Finally, ACH sold 11 of its new medium twin ACH160s, and two ACH175s. Lemos said “several” ACH160s will be delivered this year in different countries around the world. While the type has been certified by the European regulator since July 2020, it is still awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It hopes to have this in hand and deliver the first U.S. H160 this year.

In terms of geographical spread, ACH’s market remains successful in its traditionally strong areas: Europe, Brazil and the U.S. The three regions provide 80 percent of ACH’s orders.

“What you can see is when the ecosystem is favoring helicopters, then helicopters are flourishing; and where there is the wealth, but the ecosystem is not favoring helicopters, then the market is not [growing] as much as the potential shows,” said Lemos.

A prime example of the latter is China, which remains a slow-growing market for the VIP brand.

“The wealth is there, there’s numbers of prospects and clients, the country is large, interconnections will be much easier with a helicopter, but . . . helicopters are not flourishing,” said Lemos. “Aerospace is not free, and showing wealth is not something that you can easily do.”

Despite the positivity from 2021’s figures, Lemos said a couple of factors were likely to impact this year’s numbers. Firstly, the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia have cut a portion of ACH’s business for the foreseeable future.

“Even if it is only a little portion of our market in Europe, still this little portion will not be there,” he said. “I’m confident that this portion overall will grow, so it compensates for the fact that there is no more Russian market out there and no more Russian clients, either.”

Finally, lead times have increased on several platforms, potentially cooling the market a little.

“When you have slots immediately available, the market goes quite fast,” said Lemos, “so it could be a limiting factor to globally have lead times that are slightly longer than what we had in 2020.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9992427825927734}",positive,0.9992427825927734,1

Delta (DAL) to Introduce Its Airbus A321neo Next Month - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWx0YS1kYWwtaW50cm9kdWNlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLTE0NTYwMjA2Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To modernize its fleet, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL announced that it will start operating its first of 155 new Airbus A321neo aircraft from May 20, 2022. The debut flight using a new aircraft will take off from Delta's Boston hub and head for San Fransisco. In the coming months, Delta will further expand flight services on the Airbus A321neo plane to include destinations like Denver, San Diego and Seattle. While flights to Seattle will begin operating on Aug 11, services to San Diego and Denver will commence from Aug 20.

The Airbus A321neo being the latest addition to Delta is a fuel-efficient new-generation aircraft to help reinforce the airline’s position as an industry leader in executing environmentally-sustainable endeavors. Further, it enhances and elevates the passenger experience through the carrier's many investments in cabin configurations and products. Equipped with a total seating capacity of 194 (20 customers in First Class, 42 in Delta Comfort+ and 132 in the Main Cabin), the new jets will be deployed primarily across Delta’s extensive domestic network.

Delta will operate up to 155 daily nonstop flights to 53 locations this summer (more than 20% increase in capacity since its pre-pandemic peak in October 2019). By mid-August, Delta will serve each of Boston’s 20 most popular markets nonstop, including a nonstop service to five additional sites, namely Tel Aviv, Athens, Baltimore, Denver and San Diego.

Currently, DAL has purchase commitments for a total of 155 A321neos and will take delivery of these aircraft through 2027, mainly from the Airbus US Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, AL. Delta now has 235 new aircraft purchase commitments, including both widebody and narrowbody jets. This strengthens its strategic fleet objectives to streamline operations and drive productivity in a much sustainable fashion.

Such customer-friendly fleet-modernization exercises are expected to attract more and more traffic, thereby aiding top-line growth.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation sector are Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ODFL and Triton International Limited TRTN.

Expeditors delivers a surprise of 34.2%, on average, with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters. The uptick is contributing to the carrier’s airfreight revenues. We are optimistic about EXPD’s buyout of the Fleet Logistics’ Digital Platform. The acquisition boosted its online LTL shipping platform Koho. The move is in line with its focus on Digital Solutions.

EXPD currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The long-term expected earnings per share (EPS) (three-to-five years) growth rate for Old Dominion is pegged at 16%. ODFL is benefiting from the strong performance of its LTL segment owing to improved freight conditions. In 2021, revenues from the LTL services segment increased 30.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Driven by the tailwinds, the stock has risen 13.1% in the past year. ODFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The long-term expected EPS (three-to-five years) growth rate for Triton is pegged at 10%. Gradual increases in trade volumes and container demand bode well for TRTN. With easing coronavirus-led restrictions in the United States and Europe, the company saw a strong rebound in its business in the third and the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as in each of the four quarters of 2021.

Driven by these positives, the stock has rallied 25.1% in the past year. TRTN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

Sutton Place, Surrey. daves_archive_1/Wikimedia Commons.

The UK government said that Usmanov owned Sutton Place, a 16th-century estate located in Surrey, in the south of England.

The property is estimated to be valued at $40.5 million and is listed as a Grade I historic building, according to the OCCRP's asset tracker.

The mansion was owned by a series of wealthy men in the 20th century, per OCCRP, including the oil magnate J. Paul Getty.

The estate is not listed as belonging to an individual but instead to two companies in Cyprus, according to the tracker. A recent investigation by the Financial Times found a number of business links connecting Usmanov to the property, but could not trace it directly back to him.

A spokesperson for Usmanov told Insider that Sutton Place is not ""owned or used by Mr. Usmanov.""

""It is the property of the trusts whose beneficiary is his sister, and who has a family of her own. We have already stated that long ago, Mr. Usmanov transferred his real estate and other property into irrevocable family trusts. We have also emphasised that this had nothing to do with sanctions or an attempt to hide anything, but was driven by the wish to care for his relatives,"" the statement added.

The spokesperson said that Usmanov started to establish trusts 15 years ago, renouncing any rights he held to the assets he transferred into them.

It is not clear when the assets related to Sutton Place Estate were transferred into the trust.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999980926513672}",neutral,0.9999980926513672,0
Second ocean-monitoring satellite completes environmental tests - Airbus,"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA0LXNlY29uZC1vY2Vhbi1tb25pdG9yaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC10ZXN0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Friedrichshafen, 07 April 2022 - The ""Copernicus Sentinel-6"" mission is already delivering high-precision measurements of the topography of ocean surfaces through the first of two satellites, named “Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich”, launched in November 2020 and Airbus has just completed the environmental test campaign for the second satellite, Sentinel-6B. It will now be returned to its home base at Airbus’ satellite integration centre in Friedrichshafen (Germany) to make the final touches to the spacecraft.

The mission’s two satellites are built to measure the distance to the sea surface to an accuracy of a few centimetres and map it in a 10-day rhythm over a mission duration of up to seven years. Their purpose is to record changes in the height of the sea surfaces, variations in sea levels and analyse and observe ocean currents. Accurate observation of sea surface height changes provides information about global sea levels, the speed and direction of ocean currents and the heat stored in the oceans. The measurements – obtained from 1336 km above the Earth – are crucial for ocean modelling and predicting sea level rise.

This information helps governments and institutions establish effective protection for coastal regions. The data is also valuable for disaster management organisations, and for authorities carrying out urban planning, flood protection schemes, or dyke construction.

As a result of global warming, global sea levels are currently rising by an average of 3.3 millimetres per year - with potentially dramatic consequences for countries with densely populated coasts. On 22 March 2022 “Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich”, became the official reference satellite for global sea level measurements. This means that sea surface height data collected by other satellites will be compared to the information produced by “Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich” to ensure their accuracy.

Part of Europe’s Copernicus, Sentinel-6 is an international collaboration between ESA (European Space Agency), NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and Eumetsat (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites).

Airbus-led Digital Alliance Lands SAS As Launch Customer - Aviation Week,"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93cy1ldmVudHMvbXJvLWFtZXJpY2FzL2FpcmJ1cy1sZWQtZGlnaXRhbC1hbGxpYW5jZS1sYW5kcy1zYXMtbGF1bmNoLWN1c3RvbWVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS—SAS Scandinavian Airlines will be the launch customer of a product developed by the Airbus-led Digital Alliance venture that targets predictive maintenance and other data-driven operational efficiency drivers, signing up for the partnership’s Skywise Predictive Maintenance Alliance (SPMA) offering.

The deal, announced at Aviation Week’s MRO Americas, will see SAS use the product to track parameters from various components on its Airbus A320-family fleet.

“Thanks to SPM Alliance, we will be able to pre-empt operational disruptions and accelerate maintenance decisions by predicting potential in-service issues across our large A320-family fleet,” said SAS Head of Technical Operations Marko Rudic. “This is the proactive approach to fleet technical management that SAS wants to take.”

The airline’s primary goals include providing its operations center team more visibility into each aircraft’s maintenance status. Aircraft that may need certain parts or services can be kept close to stations that can support them, for example, or off “high value” routes that the airline wants to protect from even slight disruptions, Rudic said. More broadly, knowing when components are approaching failure will help cut down on schedule disruptions.

The SAS deal gives the partnership its first customer for its debut product less than a year after the current, three-member alliance was rounded out.

Airbus and Delta Tech Ops launched it in 2019, with the manufacturer providing its Skywise data analytics platform and visibility into thousands of customer aircraft—including many non-Airbus models.

“Forty percent of the data coming into Skywise comes from non-Airbus aircraft,” said Airbus SVP Digital Solutions Lionel Rouby, adding that access to the data of its 125 customers is strictly controlled. “All of the data from our partners and customers is fully protected,” he said.

As an operator and a maintenance provider, Delta validates reliability and repair algorithms that are key to ensuring predictive maintenance works as advertised, said Mahendra Nair, Delta SVP fleet and tech ops supply chain.

In 2021, GE Digital joined the alliance, bringing with it data from about 50% of the commercial fleet via its array of products, including flight data monitoring and fuel management, said Andrew Coleman, president of GE Digital’s Aviation Software business.

Each company was diligently working on its own data-driven maintenance projects before the alliance. Delta in 2015 launched Airbus’ Prognostics and Risks Management service, while both GE Digital and Airbus have customer-facing products. Improvements in technology, including how to create effective algorithms for major data-analysis projects, and demand for a broad, product-agnostic suite of products, drove the group to team up.

“As airlines are on the path to recovery, it is more important than ever to support them in saving costs and optimizing their fleets’ availability,” Rouby said. “This is precisely what SPM Alliance does: covering a wide scope of equipment, our new solution brings another dimension to predictive maintenance that will considerably reduce unplanned maintenance.”

The joint effort will likely expand, as companies from both within aviation and the tech world are taking notice of the alliance’s work, Coleman said.

“It’s not a closed ecosystem just between the three of us,” he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9170509576797485}",neutral,0.9170509576797485,0

New air routes, aircraft deliveries to Russia halted, and pressure on Russian titanium supplies are among the consequences of the war in Ukraine on the aeronautics sector.

New Air Routes

Perhaps the most visible effects so far have been reciprocal airspace overflight restrictions, where Russian aircraft have been banned from the skies of more than three dozen countries, and vice versa.

Air routes and supply chains between Europe and eastern Asia, in particular, have been affected, leading most passenger airlines to cancel flights and air cargo carriers to route either over Anchorage or the Middle East.

According to Ian Petchenik from flight tracking service FlightRadar24,

“The impact of the ongoing flight bans for Russian aircraft severely limit the destinations to which Russian airlines can fly. Nearly all of Europe is cut off to Russian travelers and Russian cargo airlines are shut out of most of the world’s busiest hubs. For flights prohibited from entering Russian airspace the result is greater fuel burn and more time spent in the air. The cost is mostly monetary and environmental, but the flights can still operate with creative routings.”

Aircraft Deliveries to Russia Halted

The effect of the sanctions decided by the European Union and the United States is the suspension by aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing of deliveries and support services to Russian customers, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country.

Airbus was expected to deliver thirteen A350s to the Russian company Aeroflot before the war started. Those deliveries will never happen.

Equally high profile, meanwhile, was the seizure by Russia of around 500 Airbus and Boeing jets leased to Russian airlines after sanctions drove the termination of those leases. Owing to requirements around continuing airworthiness certification, it is unlikely that these aircraft will ever fly outside Russia again — partly because they will be seized by their original owners, and partly for safety regulator oversight reasons.

Titanium Supplies at Risk

Another key area of concern continues to be aviation’s reliance on Russian titanium, mainly from the world’s largest producer. VSMPO-AVISMA, itself part of state-owned arms conglomerate Rostec, holds 25-30% of the global market.

Russia supplies nearly half of the world’s titanium and is a direct provider for companies such as Boeing, Airbus and Safran.

VSMPO-Avisma is not directly affected by the sanctions so it can continue its exports. European companies including Airbus and Safran are therefore still buying titanium from VSMPO-Avisma. Boeing, however, announced last month it is breaking its deal with the Russian group and won’t be using any Russian titanium in the future. Unlike the European manufacturers, the American manufacturer has large inventories and significant domestic production of titanium.

Why is Titanium so Important for Aviation?

Titanium is increasingly used in modern aircraft because it is a light, hyper-resistant and low-corrosive material.

Titanium also has non-expansion properties, which are vital in new composite aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 in particular, which do not expand and contract in the same way as older aluminum aircraft.

These modern aircraft are approximately 15% titanium in total empty weight terms, with key titanium components including landing gear, pylons, door frames and other high load areas.

Another key area of concern continues to be aviation’s reliance on Russian titanium, mainly from the world’s largest producer. (iStock)

Titanium can for example be found in the fuselage and structural parts of civil and military aircraft and in engines for compressors and turbine blades. Helicopter manufacturers also use titanium for the main rotor. The space industry also needs titanium. The engine and tanks of the Ariane rocket contain titanium.

While larger aerospace companies have some stockpiled titanium, the complications of the supply chain may well mean that smaller suppliers encounter difficulties — especially in the longer term.

Delivery slowdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the ongoing delivery stoppage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and delays to the program of the Boeing 777X, mean that there will be some leeway.

But if the conflict continues, and especially if sanctions on Russia are maintained, this supply crunch will bite harder. While diversification of supply — here and elsewhere in the industry — was already a priority, it will be instructive to observe the effects of these externalities on the industry, especially around new technologies and innovation. If a multiple-supplier, jurisdictional or non-Russian supplier threshold must be met for the inclusion of certain materials or technologies, future innovation within the aerospace industry could well be stifled.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9888767600059509}",negative,0.9888767600059509,-1

“With the addition of the UH-72B Lakota to our fleet, the U.S. Army increases our capability to save lives, protect communities, and provide disaster relief when it’s needed most,” said Col. Calvin Lane, U.S. Army Project Manager for Utility Helicopters. “The Lakota helicopter has been a staple of the Army for more than 15 years now, and we look forward to benefitting from the latest technologies and performances that the newest 72B variant will provide, at no additional research & development costs for the Army.”

The UH-72B is the latest iteration of the proven commercial, off-the-shelf aircraft that has been the Army’s Light Utility Helicopter since the first Lakota contract award in 2006. The Army is leveraging the benefits of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) program by receiving product improvements and enhancements through the evolution of the aircraft, without investing any government money into the development of those capabilities.

Based on the widely successful H145, the UH-72B incorporates technologies that increase both safety and flight performance, including the five-bladed main rotor, the Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, Safran Arriel 2E engines, and the Airbus-designed Helionix avionics suite. The Helionix suite includes an advanced dual-duplex, four-axis autopilot to provide flight envelope and over-limit protection, automated takeoff, and fully-coupled approaches to hover.

“Our teams in Mississippi, many of whom are U.S. Army and National Guard veterans themselves, are proud to build and deliver the first of this newest Lakota variant in support of the Army’s essential missions protecting and serving our country,” said Scott Tumpak, vice president responsible for Airbus military helicopter programs in the U.S. “We thank the Army for the trust they’ve placed in Airbus for more than 15 years and counting, as we continue to build on the Lakota legacy for the women and men in uniform that depend on it.”

With nearly 10 different configurations available, the Lakota delivers proven performance, outstanding operational reliability, and unmatched versatility for a broad spectrum of military missions. Airbus Helicopters, Inc. builds the Lakota at its production facility in Columbus, Mississippi, which employs a workforce of nearly 250 employees that is made up of 40% U.S. veterans.

MetOp-SG-B weather satellite: Scatterometer flies through tests - Airbus,"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNC1tZXRvcC1zZy1iLXdlYXRoZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXNjYXR0ZXJvbWV0ZXItZmxpZXMtdGhyb3VnaC10ZXN0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Scatterometers play a central role in monitoring climate change

Next generation weather satellite set to improve regional & global forecasting

Madrid, 6 April, 2022 – The flight model of the Scatterometer Antenna Subsystem (SAS) of the MetOp Second Generation meteorological satellites has been officially delivered after four months of extensive testing at the Airbus facility in Madrid. It will now be transferred to Airbus in Friedrichshafen (Germany) where it will be integrated into the satellite along with the other instruments.

The SAS protoflight model underwent a lengthy test campaign where it was subjected to the extreme conditions that it will encounter during launch and in-orbit operation. These tests included: antenna deployment, thermal cycling, mechanical vibrations and acoustic environment.

""It is for us a very important milestone as it is a three-antenna system with a very complex in-orbit deployment,"" said Luis Guerra, Head of Airbus Space Systems Spain. ""The MetOp-SG SAT-B meteorological satellites will rely on two key instruments with major contribution from Airbus in Spain to carry out their mission: the Scatterometer (SCA) with the Antenna Subsystem (SAS) and the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI).""

The SCA with its major subsystem SAS is one of five instruments on board MetOp-SG SAT-B and will provide double the resolution of the first generation MetOp satellites. It will measure wind speed and direction over the ocean surface, to help monitor scale phenomena such as ocean winds and continental ice sheets, and check land surface soil moisture – a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere. It is expected to cover 99% of the Earth's surface within a period of 2 days and with a resolution of 25 kilometres.

Data provided by scatterometers has been used for over 30 years, since ERS-1 and 2, for weather and wave forecasting. More recently, with MetOp satellites, it has been used to study unusual weather phenomena such as El Niño, the long-term effects of deforestation and changes in sea-ice masses around the poles. All of which play a central role in monitoring climate change.

The MetOp-SG SAT-B series of satellites focus on the use of microwave sensors that will provide: enhanced infrared, microwave and radio occultation temperature and humidity soundings; polar atmospheric motion vectors extracted from optical images; new precipitation and cloud measurements from images in the optical, submillimetre and microwave spectra; and high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind vector and soil moisture extracted from scatterometer observations. These data will help improve numerical weather prediction - the backbone of our daily weather forecasts - regionally and globally.

The first launch of the MetOp-SG mission is scheduled for 2024 after completion of integration and satellite level testing. The nominal operational lifetime of each of the three MetOp-SG satellites is 7.5 years, ensuring full operational coverage over a 21-year period.

Here's How Airbus Will Beat Boeing - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzI4L2hlcmVzLWhvdy1haXJidXMtd2lsbC1iZWF0LWJvZWluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing's been skimping on R&D, while Airbus has invested in its future.

I don't think I'll be bursting any bubbles or spoiling any surprises when I say the pandemic was not a good time to be in the airplane business.

Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) deliveries plunged 35% between 2019 and 2020, just one year after the European plane maker had stolen Boeing's (BA -1.90%) crown as the world's biggest seller of airplanes. Boeing's deliveries fell by more than half, hurt by the twin disasters of both the pandemic and Boeing's 787 MAX fiasco.

Now the good news is that, in 2021, both companies' delivery numbers recovered somewhat (and Boeing recovered more substantially than Airbus). Also, orders (not deliveries) for airplanes more than tripled off their 2020 lows. But as Boeing and Airbus fly into 2022, these two airplane-building giants are hardly flying side by side.

Globally, according to Reuters estimates, Airbus now holds about a 78% market share in commercial airplane deliveries so far in 2022. And as the chart below shows, Airbus' dramatically expanding lead in research and development (R&D) spending sets up Airbus to continue outperforming its rival in the years to come.

Sacrificing dollars tomorrow to save pennies today

As you can see, in the three years prior to the pandemic, Airbus was growing its R&D spending, while Boeing's R&D spending was generally holding steady. Once the pandemic hit, both companies cut spending on R&D, but Airbus cut its spending by only about 17% through 2021, while Boeing cut nearly twice as much -- 30%.

That matches historical patterns for the two companies. Although they bring in roughly similar levels of annual revenue -- $76.5 billion for Boeing and $79 billion for Airbus in 2019; $62.3 billion for Boeing and $59.3 billion for Airbus in 2021 -- how the companies invest those revenues in improving their products differs markedly.

Simply put: With the sole exception of in 2016, Airbus has heavily outspent Boeing in terms of R&D over the past decade.

You can see the companies' respective emphases on R&D, too, in how much they spend on R&D relative to spending on ""overhead"" -- selling, general, and administrative expenses (SGA).

Here, 2019 was the outlier year for Airbus, in which R&D spending was abbreviated. But every other year for the past 10 years, Airbus emphasized R&D far more than Boeing did. During the pandemic, the difference became especially stark, with Airbus spending roughly $1.34 on R&D for every $1 spent on SGA -- while Boeing spent closer to $0.59 on R&D for every $1 of SGA!

Now, is it possible that Boeing is just so good at science and engineering that it can vastly underspend Airbus in this crucial area of development, yet still churn out competitive products? I suppose that's possible, but I wouldn't bet on it. To the contrary, the more I look at these numbers, the more I'm convinced that Airbus airplanes and Airbus stock are going to outperform Boeing for a long time to come.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.4668631851673126}",neutral,0.4668631851673126,0

However, the comments are yet to be confirmed by the manufacturer.

A company spokesperson was cited by Reuters on April 4, 2022, as saying: “We have always said that the recovery of the market is foreseen between 2023 and 2025 and will be led by single-aisle followed by wide-body. […] We continue to expect to increase the A350 production rate from around 5 per month to around 6 in early 2023.”

However, on the same day Bloomberg published a report citing people who asked not to be named alleging that the initial goal of building six A350s a month by early 2023 could be delayed until the end of that year amid international sanctions enforced on Russian flag carrier Aeroflot and Airbus’s ongoing legal dispute with Qatar Airways.

The manufacturer was involved in a dispute with Qatar Airways, one of the largest customers of the A350 jet. In late 2021, Qatar Airways sued Airbus over fuselage surface deterioration on its A350s, seeking more than $600 million in compensation. Qatar Airways, which has 53 A350s in its fleet, claims it had to remove a total of 22 aircraft from the flight roster.

In the latest chapter of its dispute with Airbus, in February 2022, Qatar Airways also claimed that defects in the airline’s several Airbus A350s could cause fuel tanks to ignite. The Doha-based carrier has raised concerns that flaws on the surface of the A350 fuselage could attract pollutants, such as salt or hydraulic fluids, and damage the aircraft’s lightning protection.

The sources also suggest disruptions have weakened the outlook for A350 deliveries. However, Airbus currently produces up to five A350 family aircraft per month.

According to Airbus, as of February 2022, the company had seven A350 family jets on order.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9460120797157288}",negative,0.9460120797157288,-1

Up to 4.5% fuel savings on longest routes and a major step in the sustainable development of China's civil aviation.

Airbus has signed an agreement with China Southern Airlines to upgrade 48 of its A320 and A321 aircraft with Sharklets.

The modification of the first aircraft will start in May 2022 and will be completed in batches before the end of 2022. The target embodiment time is 21 hours per aircraft and once installed the Sharklets will reduce carbon emissions by approximately 30,000 tonnes per year and save nearly 10,000 tonnes of fuel.

This is an important step taken by Airbus and China Southern to reduce the environmental impact of the in-service aircraft and another tangible contribution to the environmental targets of China Southern and the country's civil aviation industry.

Sharklets are the most visible design change to the A320 Family. The new wing tips were first introduced in 2012 as an option and are now standard on all A320 Family NEO aircraft.

Any A319, A320 or A321 beyond serial number MSN5514 can be easily retrofitted with the same NEO Sharklets and take benefit from the associated fuel savings and performance enhancements.

In addition to the Sharklet modification, Airbus has a number of other modifications to help make in-service aircraft more fuel efficient and reduce their emissions.

Operators of in-service A320 Family aircraft can easily benefit from SETWA (Single Engine Taxi Without APU) and DPO (Descent Profile Optimisation) solutions. These modifications have a payback of less than 6 months in most cases and can bring an additional fuel saving of more than 220 tonnes of fuel and a CO2 reduction of more than 700 tonnes per year during typical operations.

By combining sharklets with DPO and SETWA an operator can expect to achieve a 6% reduction in fuel burn per year.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997910857200623}",positive,0.9997910857200623,1

The Chilean Navy carries out maritime search and rescue missions, as well as caring for the aquatic environment, safeguarding national assets and upholding maritime safety.

Around 26 million square kilometres of Chilean maritime territory are kept under the watchful eye of the Navy. When it comes to safeguarding human life at sea and supporting the rescue of its citizens, the Chilean Navy knows it can count on an efficient, fast, safe and state-of-the-art fleet.

December 2020 saw the delivery of the first of five H125 helicopters that the Navy acquired under the ""Gaviota"" project. This project aims to modernise the HU-1 squadron’s aircraft, which counts among its various missions the training of pilots, crews and maintenance personnel of the naval units that will work with these aircraft. Last year they received their second and third helicopter, making their first missions in the 2021/2022 summer season, a milestone for Chilean Naval Aviation.

""Specifically, we had 18 rescues during this period, mainly on the beaches of La Serena, San Antonio and Valparaiso. We also carried out preventive patrols, which were fundamental for the protection of human life,"" said the Commander of the HU-1 Squadron, Commander Ignacio Gamboa Muñoz.

""The H-125 has a great power capacity, which facilitates our work on the coast, allowing us to make stationary flights to supervise bathers who put themselves at risk, facing southeast winds of 15 to 20 knots and, in addition, the aircraft offers us stability thanks to the tail rotor,"" highlights Commander Gamboa.

""In all the rescues we had the advantage of having a faster helicopter, compared to what we had before. In addition, we had the advantage of flying with open doors, which allowed us to go up to 130 knots, compared to the previous 90 knots, so we could go at a speed 30% faster to reach an emergency"".

In terms of aircraft availability, the Navy has been very satisfied with the possibility of not having to pause between missions, which has improved its speed of response to emergencies.

H125M NAVAL

New missions

The H125s have been operating in the Coquimbo and Valparaiso regions for the past few months, but their missions have gone beyond rescue, thanks to the carrying capacity of the H125: ""Today we can carry out medical evacuation missions that were not possible before. In the past we used to lift 200kg, today we are lifting 600-800kg, which facilitates and greatly optimises the time required for this type of manoeuvre"", says the Commander of the HU-1 Squadron, Frigate Captain Ignacio Gamboa Muñoz.

For the remainder of the year, the Navy team will be conducting training courses on the H-125 and will begin its island support missions for the communities for Juan Fernandez Island, San Felix Island and Easter Island, among other missions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9934773445129395}",neutral,0.9934773445129395,0
An Airbus Jumbo Jet Just Completed Two Flights Powered by Cooking Oil - Good News Network,"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2RuZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvYW4tYWlyYnVzLWp1bWJvLWpldC1qdXN0LWNvbXBsZXRlZC10d28tZmxpZ2h0cy1wb3dlcmVkLWJ5LWNvb2tpbmctb2lsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having recently had time called on its 15 years of service, an Airbus A380 just completed some trial flights powered by cooking oil.

The largest passenger jet in the world, a double-decker behemoth just flew a three-hour intra-French test flight on Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF for short.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)—SAF’s key ingredient—are definitely not what your doctor would label as a healthy cooking oil, but for powering the Rolls Royce Trent 900 engine on board, it proved successful on March 25th on a French flight from Toulouse to Toulouse, and in a second on March 29th from Toulouse to Nice.

Far from being an introductory step, Airbus craft are already certified under both the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to fly commercially with a blend of 50-50 SAF and kerosene. Nevertheless, the company hopes to achieve 100% SAF authorization by the end of the decade.

“Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry’s ambition of netzero carbon emissions by 2050,” said Airbus in a statement.

First getting paint jobs in 2006, the A380 wasn’t as successful as the company had imagined, and the €25 billion total investment was never recouped over the 251 unit sales Airbus managed. However the 853-seater aircraft completed 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses.

They’re also using the discontinued craft to test out three new experimental green hydrogen propulsion systems. SAF is more or less finished as a technology, and requires little adaptation aboard existing passenger jets. Hydrogen, however, would provide a much greater reduction in flight emissions, something the Airbus brass are very interested in investigating.

“I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen—both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft—has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact,” Guillaume Faury, chief executive for Airbus, said in February.

Making its way through a regional demonstration tour to stop at FIDAE, Latin America’s biggest commercial and military aircraft airshow, the A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market, bringing together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines. The A220 brings customers a 50 percent reduced noise footprint and up to 25 percent lower fuel burn per seat and CO2 emissions - compared to previous generation aircraft - as well as around 50 percent lower NOx emissions than industry standards.

In addition, the A220 offers extended range capability of up to 3,450 nautical miles (6,390 km), making it the ideal aircraft for domestic and intraregional traffic in Latin America. The A220 cabin is the largest in its size category, with wider economy class seats and 20 percent more overhead storage space per passenger.

With around 15 airlines operating close to 200 A220s on four continents, the A220 has secured 740 orders from more than 25 customers around the world, confirming that it is the optimal aircraft for regional as well as long-distance routes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998831748962402}",neutral,0.9998831748962402,0
Airbus hits the wind tunnel to pursue bird-inspired active wing control - New Atlas,"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy13aW5kLXR1bm5lbC1hY3RpdmUtd2luZy1jb250cm9sL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is moving ahead with its vision of aircraft with active wing control, following successful wind tunnel tests at its facility near Bristol, England. The company is working to mimic the behavior of bird flight with wings that adapt their shape on the fly to optimize aerodynamics, making for more efficient aircraft with lower carbon footprints.

The eXtra Performance Wing project was borne out of a similar Airbus project called AlbatrossOne, which in 2019 saw engineers fly a scale-model airplane with flapping wing tips. Inspired by the albatross wing, the wings featured semi-aeroelastic hinges that responded to turbulence and gusts of wind to lessen the load on the airframe, reducing the need for reinforcing structures and saving considerable weight as a result.

Launched last September, the eXtra Performance Wing demonstrator is a continuation of this thinking, consisting of a scaled-down Cessna jet that can be fitted with gust sensors, pop-up spoilers and multifunctional trailing edges. The platform will be used to rapidly test and develop these types of technologies, with a view to improving aerodynamics for future aircraft.

“The scaled demonstrator will integrate and fly breakthrough wing technologies using a remote-controlled Cessna Citation VII business jet platform in representative flight conditions,” explained Oliver Family, Head of eXtra Performance Wing UK. “The partly 3D-printed wind-tunnel model – expertly built by the aerodynamics team at Airbus’ low-speed, wind-tunnel facility in Bristol – is a scaled-down version of the Cessna jet, incorporating the lightweight, long-span design of the eXtra Performance Wing that will provide the emissions benefits we are striving for.”

Aerospace engineers regularly turn to bird flight in an effort to improve aircraft performance. We've seen research projects show how shape-shifting wings can make aircraft more efficient, and others that demonstrate how owls could inspire planes that fly more quietly and handle strong winds. Airbus hopes that by exploring the possibilities of biomimicry at its Filton wind tunnel near Bristol, it can soon get some of these technologies off the ground.

“Airbus’ state-of-the-art low-speed wind-tunnel is a fantastic way to validate our concepts before flight tests,” added Oliver Family. “Our computational aerodynamic analysis capability is world class, and the wind tunnel provides another valuable way to measure the performance and capabilities of the aircraft before flight testing. The technologies we have tested in the Filton wind tunnel – many inspired by biomimicry – will now be rapidly integrated for flight testing.”

Air France-KLM confirms order for four A350F - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLTA0LWFpci1mcmFuY2Uta2xtLWNvbmZpcm1zLW9yZGVyLWZvci1mb3VyLWEzNTBm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 12 april 2022 - Air France-KLM has finalised its order with Airbus for four new generation A350F freighters, following the earlier commitment announced in December 2021. The freighters are destined to increase Air France’s cargo capacity with the most efficient and sustainable cargo aircraft available in the market.

The A350F is based on the world's most modern long range leader, the A350. The aircraft will feature a large main deck cargo door and a fuselage length optimised for cargo operations. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials resulting in a 30 tonnes lighter take-off weight, which together with efficient Rolls-Royce engines generate an advantage of at least 20% lower fuel burn and CO2 over its current closest competitor. With a 109 tonnes payload capability (+3t payload / 11% more volume than its competition), the A350F serves all cargo markets (Express, general cargo, special cargo…) and is in the large freighter category the only new generation freighter aircraft ready for the enhanced ICAO CO₂ emissions standards.

“Airlines now have a choice, and we salute Air France joining those going for the A350F’s step change in efficiency and sustainability for the cargo operations of the future. We are gratified by the wave of early adopters who, like Air France, see the economics and environmental signature of the A350s as standing out versus alternatives, past, existing and future. Merci Air France.” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

Launched in 2021, the A350F recorded 29 orders and commitments from five customers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7841120362281799}",positive,0.7841120362281799,1
Cooking Oil Could Be the New Jet Fuel - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 04 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvZW5lcmd5L2EzOTYxMjg1MS9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mbGllcy1vbi1jb29raW5nLW9pbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest airliner has flown on 100 percent renewable fuel for the first time.

A380, Airbus’s designated “flying testbed,” will also fly on hydrogen by 2026.

Sustainable aviation fuel is made by treating waste oil and biomass into diesel.

Your hippie cousin’s biodiesel Volvo has new competition from an unexpected place: the world’s largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380. On March 25 and March 29, two of the aircraft made pilot flights out of France on 100 percent recycled cooking oil and other waste fats. No word yet on whether the flight also smelled like fried chicken or egg rolls.

The A380, which has been in production since 2007, is the largest-ever commercial passenger aircraft, holding up to 525 people in a wide-body airliner. Just over 250 of these planes were sold, and the model is considered a mixed success at best because Airbus didn’t earn back its sizable investment in the aircraft. The A380 is the third Airbus aircraft to be able to fly on 100 percent sustainable fuel, preceded by the smaller Airbus A350 last March and the A319neo in October.

✈️ You love badass planes. So do we. Fly with us—join Pop Mech Pro.

Airbus says the first took off from Toulouse, France, and lasted three hours before landing in the same place. (Airbus has a major office located in Toulouse.) The second flight was from Toulouse to Nice and also used 100 percent sustainable fuel.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a huge benchmark goal for the aviation industry. In the fight against climate change, airplanes stick out for their major reliance on fossil fuels; they also present an especially challenging use case in replacing jet fuel with more sustainable sources. The heavy batteries that weigh down the average Tesla automobile aren’t yet realistic for aircraft, which must cut back on as much weight as possible.

This is where recycled cooking oil stepped in to help. Since oils are fundamentally hydrocarbons, used cooking oil is an ideal source to chemically shift into SAF. France’s own TotalEnergies, one of the world’s largest petrochemical companies, provided the oil.

“The SAF produced in Normandy, close to Le Havre, France, was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), free of aromatics and sulphur, and primarily consisting of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats,” Airbus reports in a prepared statement. Hydroprocessing is a way to turn waste fat, or even biomass like wood or corn waste, into usable diesel-type fuel.

Airbus planes can currently fly with up to half SAF and half kerosene, making a blend similar to the fuel in consumer cars that’s made up of some percentage of ethanol. But Airbus wants to get certified to fly 100 percent SAF across its entire aircraft line by 2030. It also wants to have hydrogen engines in the testing phase for A380s by 2026.

The A380 may not have recouped its estimated $25 billion research and development and production cost, but it’s still an icon of Airbus’s lineup. That may be why the company has chosen an A380 as its official experimental aircraft for future technologies. This A380 is now known as the ZEROe Demonstrator, what Airbus calls “a flying testbed for future technologies” that will help develop a zero-emission commercial aircraft for use by 2035.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999074935913086}",neutral,0.9999074935913086,0
