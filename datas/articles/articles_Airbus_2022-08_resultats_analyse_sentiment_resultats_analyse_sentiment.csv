Fly me to the Moon! NASA's Orion spacecraft with the Airbus-built European Service Module is ready for launch - Airbus,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wOC1mbHktbWUtdG8tdGhlLW1vb24tbmFzYXMtb3Jpb24tc3BhY2VjcmFmdC13aXRoLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYnVpbHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe supplies the ‘heart and lungs’ for astronaut lunar missions

Airbus is leading the European team on behalf of ESA

Bremen/Cape Canaveral, 23 August 2022 - NASA's Orion spacecraft will be launched in a few days from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA, on its mission to the Moon. The Airbus-built European Service Module (ESM) will power Orion to and from its lunar orbit as part of NASA’s Artemis missions. Airbus has developed the ESM as prime contractor for the European Space Agency ESA and is designing and manufacturing a further five ESMs.

The ESM is a key element of Orion, the next-generation spacecraft that will carry astronauts beyond low Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo programme ended in the 1970s. The module provides propulsion, power and thermal regulation and will supply astronauts with water and oxygen on future missions. The ESM is installed below the crew module. Together, the two make up the Orion spacecraft.

""The launch of NASA's Orion spacecraft with the European Service Module has historic significance 50 years after the last astronaut lunar mission and is another major step toward returning astronauts to the Moon. The programme is now moving forward and we are ready for a return to the lunar surface in 2025 together with our customers ESA and NASA and our industrial partner Lockheed Martin Space,"" said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Space Systems at Airbus.

The launch of the first Orion spacecraft using NASA's new ‘Space-Launch System’ rocket will be crewless and will take Orion more than 70,000 kilometres beyond the Moon to demonstrate its capabilities. Artemis II, planned for around 2024 and powered by the ESM-2, will carry four astronauts to space and return them safely to Earth. Then, a year later, the ESM-3 will ensure that another Orion capsule safely carries the first woman to the Moon. The technologies developed and experience collected during the Artemis Missions will be fundamental for possible future long-term missions to Mars, for example.

The ESM consists of more than 20,000 parts and components, from electrical equipment to thrusters, solar arrays, propellant tanks, life support materials and several kilometres of cables and hoses.

The ESM is a cylinder about four metres high and wide. It is similar to the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV 2008 - 2015), also built by Airbus, and features the signature four-bladed solar array (19 metres in diameter when deployed), which generates enough power for two households. The service module's 8.6 tons of propellant power the main engine, eight auxiliary engines and 24 smaller thrusters ensure navigation and attitude control.

At launch, the ESM weighs a total of just over 13 tons. In addition to serving as the main propulsion system for the Orion spacecraft, the ESM will enable orbital manoeuvring and attitude control. It will provide the crew with key life support elements such as water and oxygen and regulate thermal control while docked to the crew module. Also the unpressurized service module can be used to carry additional payloads.

For the first landing on the Moon, the Orion spacecraft will dock with the international Lunar Gateway - a lunar-orbiting platform that will enable sustained space exploration and expand humanity's presence in space.

The A380’s biggest supporter is asking Airbus to build a new super jumbo - CNN,"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZW1pcmF0ZXMtYm9zcy10aW0tY2xhcmstb24tdGhlLWEzODAtYW5kLXdoeS13ZS1uZWVkLWEtbmV3LXN1cGVyLWp1bWJvL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWxodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9lbWlyYXRlcy1ib3NzLXRpbS1jbGFyay1vbi10aGUtYTM4MC1hbmQtd2h5LXdlLW5lZWQtYS1uZXctc3VwZXItanVtYm8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The A380 super jumbo has many supporters around the world, but none quite as vocal and powerful as Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, by far the largest operator of the aircraft.

The Dubai-based airline purchased nearly half of all A380s ever produced and now has 118 in its fleet, about 80 of which are currently flying.

The entire fleet will be back in the air by spring of next year, as part of a resurgence that has seen the super jumbo reintroduced into service with many of its operators, after the pandemic led many to believe it was ready for retirement.

“The notion that the A380 was a spent force was always a little bit of a difficult one for us to swallow,” Clark told CNN Travel in an exclusive interview.

“I was chuckling to myself, thinking ‘Wait and see.’ We started flying the A380 into Heathrow six times a day in October of last year, and we haven’t had a [free] seat on any of them since.”

The airline will start refreshing the interiors of almost 70 of its A380s later this year, adding a new premium economy class that will slightly reduce passenger capacity from 519 to 484.

Shower spa experience

The Emirates A380 is equipped with a shower spa for first class passengers. Emirates

The most distinctive feature of Emirates’ super jumbo, however, will remain the legendary shower spa, which offers first class passengers the luxury of a full-fledged shower at 35,000 feet.

There are two such suites, at the front of the upper deck, and Emirates is the only airline to offer them, after Clark explicitly requested them during the final design phase of the plane, in the early 2000s.

“Airbus had come up with a fairly sad possibility of putting benches and having little lounges there, but the notion that you would have bathrooms with showers and all the other bits and pieces was an interesting one,” he says.

“It was a bit of a risk for us, but these were dead spaces which we couldn’t generate income from. I realized that actually they would be hugely popular.”

Convincing Airbus to install them, however, wasn’t easy.

“We designed the showers and then went to Airbus, who were very much arms folded at that time,” Clark adds.

“But prior to the A380’s launch, the marketing program showed double page spreads with avenues of shops, lounges and cafes, so naturally I said, ‘that shouldn’t be a problem for you.’

“Clearly it was, but because we were such a big buyer, they complied. And it’s no mean feat trying to get water up two decks, keep the pressure up, the heating and all that.

“But we succeeded, they worked with us, and the rest is history. People talked about these showers for years and they still do.”

A new A380?

Emirates' entire A380 fleet will be back in air by the spring of 2023. Emirates

Clark has long lamented the fact that neither Airbus or Boeing plan to build a new plane the size of the A380.

Currently, the largest planes offered by the two leading manufacturers are the Airbus A350-1000 and the upcoming 777-9, which both seat just over 400 people in a standard configuration.

However, deliveries of these planes have been delayed and Clark believes they are too small to replace the A380 in Emirates’ fleet.

“The math tells you that you need a big unit, much bigger than we’re getting at the moment,” he says.

“The biggest one will be the 777-9, whenever that comes to market, which in our configuration [will seat] 364 people against 484 on the A380s with our new premium economy. And it was 519 before, so you get where I’m coming from.”

The “math” Clark refers to comes from demand for air travel, which he says was growing by about 4.5% per year before the pandemic.

Assuming that curve is recaptured, it would take just 10 to 15 years to see demand increase by half.

“Even with multiple 787s and A350s all busy flying around the world, I still don’t get how you will pick up that growth curve,” says Clark.

“Supply will be suppressed, demand will continue to grow, and when that happens prices rise, it’s inevitable.

“If you take the A380s out of the frame by the mid-2030s, how are you going to make it work? Do we see massive upgrades of airfields or new airfields?

“At Heathrow, they can’t even agree on the third runway. [Amsterdam’s] Schiphol has just reduced the number of landings and takeoffs that they will allow. So, one wonders, how would this demand be accommodated?”

‘Open fan’ engine

Clark’s answer is a new plane as big as the A380, if not bigger, with modern features such as lightweight composite materials and more efficient engines.

“Is it possible to redesign a new A380? Yes. Is it possible to lighten the aircraft? Yes. When they brought this aircraft to market, composites weren’t really [widespread],” says Clark.

“Imagine a composite wing and a predominantly composite fuselage. Imagine engines that are giving you a 20 to 25% improvement compared to what you get today.

“So you get a lighter aircraft, far more fuel-efficient, which ticks all the boxes as far as the environmentalists are concerned.”

One of the A380’s biggest drawbacks are its four engines, which are inefficient to today’s standards and fuel prices. A new version would require an entirely new engine technology.

Clark says there are “very interesting studies” going on in this field, but he adds that most of the research over the last 20 years has been focused on narrow-body aircraft.

An “open fan” engine, which appears to be a propeller but is actually a larger, unducted version of the fan found inside every modern jet engine, is one of the most promising new types of engines, and could cut fuel consumption and emissions by as much as 20%.

It will be trialed on an A380 test plane.

However, it’s not meant for the aircraft: Brand new planes will need to be designed to fit these engines, and at least in the beginning, they will most likely be single aisle aircraft, similar to the 737 and A320.

“We’re trying to get everybody working on the big fans for the bigger aircraft as well,” he says.

“If you can get them to do what I think they could do in terms of fuel efficiency and power, then you have the makings of an airplane that would match or beat the economics of the [twin-engine aircraft] that we see today, by quite a long way.”

The problem with this plan is that just like the A380 wasn’t popular with airlines, a similarly sized successor likely wouldn’t be.

“Do I think that airlines will step up and sign up to this project? Doubtful at this stage,” says Clark.

“On the one hand I’m very keen to take a good hard look at this, on the other I’m not optimistic that the stakeholders in the ecosystem are up for it.

Looking to the future

“The airline industry is, rightly so, populated with people who are conservative in nature, because they’ve lost their shirts – this has been a seriously bad time for air travel.

“But now, things are starting to look a lot better, demand is back. So they have the ability to think hard about the future.

“Whether they’ve got the appetite for it, I don’t know. I know we have it.”

Geoff Van Klaveren, an aviation analyst and managing director of advisory at independent aviation consultancy IBA, agrees with Clark that there’s a need for a larger plane, but also that it won’t be easy to get one.

“There’s definitely room for a Boeing 747 replacement, but I don’t believe there’s enough demand to start a program for an aircraft larger than the A380.

“A very large plane is key to Emirates’ business model, because 70% of their passengers connect to other flights, but I don’t think Airbus or Boeing will build one just for them,” he says, adding that the most likely outcome is that even larger, higher capacity variants of the A350 and the 777 will be made instead.

However, Clark will not be moved.

“I’ve spoken to Airbus more than once,” he says. “I think they’re beginning to take it a little bit more seriously, but at the moment they are concentrating on their single aisle planes and the A350 line.

“I suspect people like [Airbus CEO] Guillaume Faury really would like to see something like this and recognizes what I could call the commercial imperative for it.

“But he is very much a technologist and will only do what his engineers and the technology will allow him to do.”

Looking at the post-pandemic travel chaos that is causing canceled flights, endless security lines and heaps of lost luggage, Clark isn’t very optimistic.

“I think you’ll see a continuation of this until the summer of next year,” he says.

“We are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. And as more markets like China, Japan and Korea open up, they will exacerbate the problem, unless the likes of Heathrow, Frankfurt and Amsterdam get their act together and start getting people into place.”

The Emirates boss says he’s amazed at the resilience of the traveling public for putting up with all of this, but they’ll have to be patient for a while longer.

“I see strong demand for the next year,” he adds. “It’s a patchy one, but my instinct is telling me the airline industry will be okay in a year’s time and things will gradually become good when we get back into equilibrium – middle of next year, or end of next year.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999830961227417}",neutral,0.999830961227417,0
"Pontifications: Airbus nears 800 sales for A220, but major challenges continue - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8xNS9haXJidXMtbmVhcnMtODAwLXNhbGVzLWZvci1hMjIwLWJ1dC1tYWpvci1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLWNvbnRpbnVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aug. 15, 2022, © Leeham News: Airbus now has nearly 800 orders for the A220, but the program is years from profitability and production faces supplier challenges like those facing the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX.

Passenger experience easily exceeds the older design A320 and 737. The A220’s 2×3 seating, 18.5 inch window/aisle seats, 19-inch wide middle seat and wide aisle draw kudos. The windows are larger than the older airplanes. Economics are better than promised by Bombardier, which designed the airplane as the C Series.

Exiting Commercial Aviation

Development costs, neglect of the Bombardier Q400 and CRJ programs and concurrent development of two new corporate jets nearly bankrupted Bombardier. To save itself, Bombardier exited commercial aviation and killed one of the two corporate jet developments. The Q400 program was sold to Longview Aviation, which rebranded the turboprop its original name, the Dash 8-400, and adopted the legacy company name, De Havilland Canada.

The CRJ program was sold to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. MHI had little interest in the CRJ regional jet. Interest was in acquiring the CRJ global product support and MRO system as a groundwork for the M100 SpaceJet it was developing. (MHI later changed CEOs in its policy of rotating the leadership. The new leaders killed the SpaceJet program, the reason for buying the CRJ in the first place.) MHI last year seriously considered restarting production of the CRJ. This idea was abandoned only last month.

The C Series was sold to Airbus in 2017, the first of Bombardier’s commercial programs to go. The impetus was a complaint filed by Boeing with the US Department of Commerce in 2017. While Commerce was assessing the complaint, Bombardier agreed to sell 50.1% of the program to Airbus. BBD was committed to fund construction of an assembly plant at Airbus’ Mobile (AL) complex and cover up to $700m in losses. (Commerce eventually upheld Boeing’s complaint and levied a 292% tariff. But the required review by the Court of International Trade found Boeing suffered no harm in a deal with Delta Air Lines that triggered the complaint. The CIT’s finding killed the tariff.)

Bombardier was unable to fulfill its commitments to Airbus, which eventually bought out Bombardier’s remaining share of the program. (A Quebec, Canada, pension fund still retains about 25% ownership of the program.)

Cutting costs

Airbus recognized that Bombardier’s cost to produce the C Series was a challenge. LNA in 2016 estimated Bombardier’s cost, including General and Administration (G&A) and other overhead, was about $33m. Airbus at the time concluded the cost of only the airplane was about $24m.

In its complaint alleging Bombardier price dumping with the Delta deal, Boeing calculated that before credits, the price to Delta was $24m and $19.6 after credits. Bombardier, which took a $500m “onerous contract charge” for the Delta and Air Canada sales, claimed the Boeing figure was millions of dollars too low. (Remember, G&A and other overhead costs are not included in the $24m cost.)

Market intelligence indicates that Airbus is having difficulty cutting costs. Raytheon Technologies units Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace are said to be especially difficult. So, other intelligence indicates, Airbus is raising the sales price of the A220 to around $40m. This figure boosts the Direct Operating Costs to challenging levels for some operators.

Delays

Headlines and stories about delays encountered by Airbus and Boeing focus on the A320neo, 737 MAX and widebody lines. Supply chain problems also affect the A220. Recent deliveries were around six weeks late. Traveled work, due to missing supplier parts, are partly to blame.

Quality control issues are cited by at least one customer taking A220s from the new Mobile (AL) assembly plant, which opened in 2020. The Final Assembly Line is still young in the complex aerospace learning curve process. The first A220 in Mobile was assembled on a line shared with the A320/321neo line.

Achieving profits

Airbus publicly stated that it needs to get the production rate up to 14/mo between the Montreal and Mobile plants as part of the efficiency and cost-cutting drive to reach profitability. How the $40m sales price may accelerate break even has not been calculated outside Airbus. However, when Bombardier still owned the C Series, an insider said it would take 1,200 sales to break even, given the $2bn in cost overruns at the time. A normal airplane program (of which there have been few in recent years) targets 400 sales for break even.

Bombardier designed a CS500 when it developed the C Series. The CS500 would be a direct competitor to the A320neo and 737-8. Under the Airbus brand, the airplane is known as the A220-500. Officials have been clear this model won’t be launched until after 2025, when profitability is achieved.

Canada unveils planned deadline to buy four Airbus tanker aircraft - Defense News,"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAyMi8wOC8xMC9jYW5hZGEtdW52ZWlscy1wbGFubmVkLWRlYWRsaW5lLXRvLWJ1eS1mb3VyLWFpcmJ1cy10YW5rZXItYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VICTORIA, British Columbia — The Canadian government expects to award a contract next year to Airbus for four new strategic tanker transport aircraft, according to the country’s National Defence Department.

The cost of the contract is yet to be determined, but the government has allocated up to CA$5 billion (U.S. $4 billion) to purchase the planes.

Airbus was designated as the only supplier qualified to provide the tankers to the Royal Canadian Air Force. As a result, a formal request for its proposal for the planes was issued to the firm on May 13, 2022.

National Defence Department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande said the government has not yet received the proposal.

“Once Airbus’ response is received, an assessment and negotiation will occur,” Lamirande said, noting that a contract is expected to be awarded by April 2023.

The Canadian Armed Forces found the Airbus A330 MRTT, a refueling and transport plane, is the only aircraft qualified for the job. The Air Force wants the first of the A330s operational by 2028.

The new aircraft are part of Canada’s Strategic Tanker Transport Capability project, meant to replace the existing CC-150 Polaris aircraft flown by the Royal Canadian Air Force. Those refueling and transport planes have been in operation since 1992.

Originally six new aircraft were to be purchased as part of the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability project. But on July 14, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand announced the military would acquire two used Airbus A330s and eventually upgrade those to become part of the Air Force’s tanker and transport fleet.

Canada acquired those used aircraft, built in 2015, from International Airfinance Corp., a global aircraft leasing company, in a deal worth about $102 million.

Lamirande said the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the commercial aviation industry created favorable market conditions to procure the used A330-200 aircraft at the best value for Canada. The government is scheduled to receive the aircraft in December 2022 and April 2023, and then ferry them to the country shortly after, she added.

“There are a number of predelivery and acceptance activities that need to be completed before any used aircraft will arrive in Canada” Lamirande said. Those include scheduled preventive maintenance, limited retrofit to prepare for service within the Air Force, painting of the aircraft, final delivery inspection and acceptance checks.

The used aircraft are currently configured for long-haul commercial use. They will initially be used for an interim period to perform cargo and troop airlift operations, said Lamirande. The planes could also be used to transport civilian passengers during humanitarian relief operations, as well as fly VIPs, such as Canada’s prime minister.

These used aircraft will, after an interim period of operations, be turned over to Airbus for conversion to the MRTT configuration as the other four new aircraft expected to be purchased.

Astra to sell electric thrusters to Airbus OneWeb Satellites - SpaceNews,"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hc3RyYS10by1zZWxsLWVsZWN0cmljLXRocnVzdGVycy10by1haXJidXMtb25ld2ViLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TITUSVILLE, Fla. — Astra Space announced Aug. 29 it won a contract from Airbus OneWeb Satellites to provide electric propulsion systems for the Arrow line of small satellites.

Astra said that Airbus OneWeb Satellites will acquire an unspecified number of its Astra Spacecraft Engines, an electric propulsion system, for Arrow satellites. Astra did not disclose or answer questions about the number of thrusters ordered or the value or duration of the deal.

The Astra Spacecraft Engine is an electric thruster that uses xenon or krypton as propellants. Astra offers two versions of the thruster, one that requires 400 watts of power and produces up to 300 kilonewton-seconds of total impulse, and another that uses 1,450 watts of power and produces up to 1.5 meganewton-seconds of total impulse.

The thruster was originally developed by a startup, Apollo Fusion. Astra, which started as a launch vehicle developer, acquired Apollo Fusion in 2021 as part of an effort to obtain technologies it needed for its vision of a vertically integrated company that could produce spacecraft as well as rockets.

Astra, in a quarterly earnings call Aug. 4, said it had received more than 100 “committed” orders for the Astra Spacecraft Engine through the end of the second quarter, and announced it was leasing a new 5,575-square-meter facility that will be devoted to production of the engine. Engine production will ramp up by the middle of 2023, although the company didn’t give an estimate of how many it expects to produce.

Chris Kemp, chief executive of Astra, said in the earnings call that customers of the Astra Spacecraft Engine are attracted by features such as a higher specific impulse, a measure of engine efficiency, as well as experience of having operated “hundreds of times” in space to date. “It’s very cost competitive, and as we work with our customers, we’re trying to strike that balance of offering a product that is high performance and lower cost,” he said.

In that same earnings call, Astra announced it was discontinuing its existing launch vehicle, the Rocket 3.3, after its most recent launch failure in June. The company is now focusing on a larger vehicle, Rocket 4, but test flights of that vehicle won’t begin until some time in 2023, and executives cautioned the new vehicle might not be ready for commercial, revenue-generating launches before the end of 2023.

In the near term, Astra expects its revenue to be dominated by sales of its Astra Spacecraft Engine. “If you look at 2023, what we’re looking at in terms of revenue forecasts will largely be spacecraft engines,” Kemp said.

Airbus OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture of satellite constellation company OneWeb and Airbus Defence and Space, did not disclose how the company plans to use the thrusters. The company is best known for producing the first generation of OneWeb satellites at its facility near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida but is also signing up commercial and government customers for its Arrow smallsat bus.

Airbus OneWeb Satellites had previously used electric propulsion systems from Fakel, a Russian company, for the OneWeb satellites it produced.

Zephyr drone lands just hours before setting flight-duration record - Space.com,"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLWRyb25lLWxvbmctbGFuZHMtYmVmb3JlLXJlY29yZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An experimental high-altitude drone being tested in conjunction with the United States Army has ended its epic flight just hours before breaking the world record for longest flight duration.

The Airbus Zephyr S came down on Friday (Aug. 19) after remaining in the air for over 64 days and setting a number of records, including longest continuous flight of an uncrewed aircraft at 64 days, 18 hours, 26 minutes.

The flight was just hours short, however, of the world record for longest continuous flight of any kind, set between Dec. 4, 1958 and Feb. 7, 1959 when two men flew in a Cessna 172 Skyhawk above Las Vegas, Nevada for 64 days, 22 hours, and 19 minutes .

The end of the Zephyr's flight was noticed by aircraft spotters using the free, online tracking software ADSB Exchange. On the day the flight ended, the UAV (using the callsign ZULU82) was seen circling above the Yuma Test Range in Arizona when it suddenly began displaying a vertical descent rate of 4,544 feet (1,385 meters) per minute. It's unknown what became of the drone when it reached ground level, but it presumably crashed.

Neither Airbus, which manufactures the Zephyr, nor the U.S. Army has issued an official statement about the abrupt end of the UAV's flight. However, an unnamed representative for Airbus told SimpleFlying.com that, despite completing numerous mission objectives throughout its months-long mission, Zephyr ""experienced circumstances that ended its current flight,"" and that no injuries occurred as a result of the unexpected hard landing.

""Our teams are currently analyzing more than 1,500 hours of stratospheric mission data. The valuable experience from this prototype's ultra-long endurance flight has proved to be a positive step toward the Army’s high-altitude platform goals,"" the statement continues.

The Zephyr S belongs to a class of aircraft known as a ""High Altitude Platform Station,"" sometimes referred to as a ""pseudo-satellite."" These aircraft are designed to stay aloft for extended periods, flying at altitudes of up to 70,000 feet (21,336 m). The Zephyr is made from lightweight carbon fiber composites and weighs just 165 pounds (75 kilograms). It's powered entirely by batteries charged by sunlight.

Those unique capabilities allow the skeletal-looking Zephyr to remain over a designated area for long periods of time, making it well suited for surveillance and security roles. Its high flight ceiling allows it to observe an area on the ground measuring 12 miles by 18 miles (20 by 30 kilometers).

In addition to surveillance, the Zephyr could be used as a communications relay, connecting ground stations that do not have a line of sight with one another, or extending the reach of existing networks much as a satellite in orbit could.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999984622001648}",neutral,0.999984622001648,0

Humanitarian response missions - Airbus,"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA4LWh1bWFuaXRhcmlhbi1yZXNwb25zZS1taXNzaW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Foundation supports charitable initiatives worldwide, leveraging an international network of organisations, associations and Airbus employees. One of its core pillars of activity is humanitarian emergency response, as explained by Sophie Pignol, the Airbus Foundation’sDisaster Response & Operations Coordinator.



Q. What has the Airbus Foundation accomplished in its goal to support humanitarian response?



As of today, the Foundation has facilitated more than 28 relief and 58 goodwill flights to numerous destinations around the globe, transporting over 1,138 tonnes of aid. Airbus-owned flight test aircraft and customer aircraft (operated on delivery flights to the customers) have been used, along with the charter of Airbus-built aircraft. Recent examples are a charter flight to Madagascar after Cyclone Batsirai and an airlift to the Republic of Moldova related to the Ukraine crisis.

More than 1,250 helicopter flight hours have been performed involving a total of 44 operations in 24 countries for disaster rescue, evacuation and support missions, as well as for training.

The Airbus Foundation also provides satellite imagery to our partners on a regular basis, with 177 requests since 2017 to help in the assessment of major natural disasters and crises by the humanitarian sector worldwide.

I also want to mention that today is World Humanitarian Day. It is a day to honour all humanitarian workers who dedicate – and sometimes lose – their lives to providelife-saving support and protection to people most in need. I would like to thank the Foundation's partners for the incredible work that their teams do every day around the world. We are proud to support and collaborate with all of them in missions to help affected people in times of crisis.

Q. What organisations and agencies are supported by the Airbus Foundation today?



We work with some of the world’s top non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide humanitarian relief where needed, and the Airbus Foundation has become an established, respected and recognised partner in emergency response for the humanitarian community.

Today, partnerships have been established with: the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); the World Food Programme Global Logistics Cluster (WFP-GLC); the French government’s Centre de Crise et de Soutien (Crisis and Support Centre); the Kenyan Red Cross Society (KRCS), Action Contre la Faim (ACF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Fondation de l’Académie de Médecine (FAM), Aviation Sans Frontières (ASF) and the Spanish government’s Agency of International Cooperation for Development (AECID).



Q. How does the Airbus Foundation launch a humanitarian support mission?



The Foundation is not an emergency responder. Our role is to coordinate with the various stakeholders involved, and to provide support by providing access to Airbus products, services and people to help when our partners need us.

For missions where we provide airlift capacity, the Airbus flight test team is contacted to determine whether they have flight test aircraft available, and we have well-developed operating procedures to ensure missions are conducted safely and as rapidly as possible. We also can charter Airbus aircraft through an Airbus logistics provider when Airbus flight test aircraft are not available.

In the case of helicopter support, we look for Airbus operators who can respond to the missions’ needs. The coordination is performed via our Airbus Helicopters Customer Centre, which identifies operators who are well located to provide their support and have the appropriate rotorcraft to perform the mission.



Q. How long does it take for the Foundation to provide a humanitarian emergency response?



When requests are submitted by our NGO partners, the Foundation team replies as quickly as possible. Our humanitarian response team is always on call, even during weekends and holidays.

Preparing a humanitarian operation is complex, with multiple stakeholders involved. From receiving the initial NGO request, it usually takes a minimum of three days to gather the relevant information to make the initial go/no-go decision. No-go can be decided due to countries at risk or with limited access due to quarantine, embargo, export control restrictions, etc…

The timing depends on factors that include the partner’s preparedness, the request’s complexity, how many actors are involved, whether all the necessary information is provided and due diligence needed for any of the stakeholders involved. The Foundation maintains the highest standards of compliance and all work adheres to Airbus Ethics & Compliance directives and policies.

Another important aspect of the process is checking the availability of an Airbus test aircraft, an Airbus charter aircraft or helicopter, when support is requested. Following this, the planning, organisation and implementation of a solution is undertaken.



Q. Is Airbus Foundation able to adapt the type of support it provides the NGO partners?



Definitely! We’re always working to expand our portfolio of support to respond to our humanitarian partners’ needs. One example is the increasing amount of satellite imagery and related services that we supply, using information gathered by Airbus-built satellites – including the latest Pléiades high-resolution optical Earth-imaging constellation – to assess needs before our partners start their mission. In 2021, satellite imagery covering more than 43,000 square kilometres was delivered, with the Foundation responding to 93 requests to assist its partners in disaster relief, drought impact, medical activities, the displacement of persons, conflict resolution and poaching.

Another example is a pilot program that we are about to launch, using Airbus-operated ships which regularly transport large components of our aircraft within the Airbus industrial network. These vessels can be utilised to support our humanitarian partners by pre-positioning supplies to hub-type warehouses at Las Palmas in Spain and Panama.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999563992023468}",neutral,0.999563992023468,0

The freighters will upgrade Etihad’s freight capacity by deploying the most efficient cargo aircraft available in the market.

This order of the A350F sees the national carrier of the UAE expanding its relationship with Airbus, and adding to its existing order of the largest passenger version of A350-1000s, five of which have been delivered.

Tony Douglas, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said: “In building one of the world’s youngest and most sustainable fleets, we are delighted to extend our long-term partnership with Airbus to add the A350 Freighter to our fleet. This additional cargo capacity will support the unprecedented growth we are experiencing in the Etihad Cargo division. Airbus has developed a remarkable fuel-efficient aircraft that, in tandem with the A350-1000 in our passenger fleet, supports our commitment to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

“Airbus is delighted to extend its long standing partnership with Etihad Airways, who recently introduced the A350 passenger services and is continuing to build on the Family with the game-changing freighter version, the A350F,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “This new generation large freighter brings unprecedented and unmatched benefits in terms of range, fuel efficiency and CO₂ savings, that support customers by enhancing operational efficiencies at the same time as reducing environmental impact.”

Etihad has also firmed up a long term agreement for Airbus’ Flight Hour Services (FHS) to support its entire A350 fleet, to maintain aircraft performance and optimise reliability. This marks the first agreement for an Airbus FHS contract for an A350-fleet in the Middle East. Separately, Etihad has also opted for Airbus' Skywise Health Monitoring, allowing the airline to access real-time management of aircraft events and troubleshooting, saving time and decreasing the cost of unscheduled maintenance.

As part of the world’s most modern long-range family, the A350F provides a high level of commonality with the A350 passenger versions. With a 109 tonne payload capability, the A350F can serve all cargo markets. The aircraft features a large main deck cargo door, with its fuselage length and capacity optimised around the industry’s standard pallets and containers.

More than 70% of the airframe of the A350F is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 30 tonne lighter take-off weight and generating at least 20% lower fuel consumption and emissions over its current closest competitor. The A350F fully meets ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards coming into effect in 2027. Including today’s commitment the A350F has won 31 firm orders by six customers.

The A350F meets the imminent wave of large freighter replacements and the evolving environmental requirements, shaping the future of air freight. The A350F will be powered by the latest technology, fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The Airbus Model - The Maritime Executive,"Sun, 07 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZS90aGUtYWlyYnVzLW1vZGVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Article originally published in May/June 2022 edition.)

European manufacturers know this plot: A once proud industry under cost pressure from foreign – chiefly Asian – competitors, jettisons its mass market segment and survives by serving a luxury niche.

During the quartz watch revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese brands like Seiko and Casio ate Swiss watchmakers’ lunch, forcing them to shift upmarket. Apart from Swatch, which salvaged the scattered remnants of “everyday” Swiss brands under a fast-fashion label, when we think “Swiss timepiece” we call to mind Rolex, Audemars Piguet or Vacheron Constantin – brands that sell watches for prices that are, if not unattainable, then at least aspirational for the average shopper.

The shipwrights of the Old World have undergone a similar metamorphosis. In the aughts, before the “shipping crisis,” European shipyards’ orderbooks were filled with a colorful mix of different work. In 2007, for example, container ships, passenger ships, offshore vessels, tankers and even general cargo ships made up significant percentages of the 16.8 million compensated gross tons (CGT) of vessel to be delivered that year. (Note: CGTs are a standardized measurement of the work that goes into building one ton of ship, developed in 1977 and last revised in 2007 by the OECD.)

Even some bulkers were still “Made in Europe”! Indeed, no single category of ship made up more than 35 percent of the overall orderbook, and many shipyards served a diversity of buyers.

Shrinking Orderbook

Today, European shipyards report only 11.5 million CGT on their orderbooks. More than 9.95 million CGT of that is from yachts and cruise ships. The rest consists of offshore and general cargo vessels. In other words, 86 percent of the orderbook is made up of luxury and pleasure craft.

SEA Europe, an industry association representing virtually all of Europe’s shipyards, admitted as much in an April 2021 press release: “Europe has lost nearly its entire merchant shipbuilding and part of its offshore shipbuilding to Asia. Europe’s market share declined from 45 percent in the '80s to five percent today.” The European-built coastal motor vessel, the symbol of Europe’s robust short sea shipping trade, is practically extinct.

In the 1990s and 2000s, as other kinds of shipbuilding went to Asia, the German Association for Shipbuilding Industry & Marine Technology launched a rescue program targeted at leveraging technology to cater to customers wanting to launch private passenger ships and yachts. Government loan guarantee programs followed to help shipyards secure more orders.

Yachts and cruise ships are high value but only narrowly relevant. What both share is that building them requires a high level of skilled craftsmanship, technological finesse and beautiful design, which sounds like the glossy ads I’ve seen touting Swiss horology.

Bankruptcies

However, the decision to keep the lights on with cruise ships and yachts is high-risk. COVID-19 severely wounded the cruise industry. At Seatrade in Miami Beach, Florida, the CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, Jason Liberty, suggested that cruising would recover its pre-COVID-19 level in 2023 but that 2022 would be “a year of transition,” following two years of bleeding.

Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs own 10 percent of the world’s biggest yachts – which was fine until President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian soldiers to invade Ukraine. That triggered sanctions including yacht seizures. Auctions will inevitably follow as those seizures are put through due process. Both load-bearing columns that support contemporary European shipbuilding have been undermined recently.

Following the outbreak of COVID and the Diamond Princess fiasco, major cruise lines like Carnival, MSC and Royal Caribbean cancelled sailings. Shipbuilding stopped; orders dried up. A 2021 study conducted at the University of Szczecin in Poland concluded grimly that “Shipyards in Europe would not be able to operate without state financial aid.”

Without money coming in for production milestones and without down payments being made for the placement of new orders, shipyards turned to government for support.

MV Shipyards, now part of Malaysia’s Genting Group, was one of the recipients: 300 million euros flowed into the company from the German “Covid Rescue Shield.” As waves of money from Berlin rolled in, the local leader of the powerful metalworking union IG Metall, Daniel Friederich, blithely remarked: “Thanks to federal loans and the associated union tariff agreement, the three sites in Rostock, Stralsund and Wismar are now secure and will continue on as functioning yards.”

However, on January 10, 2022, MV Shipyards filed for bankruptcy. The site and equipment in Stralsund found a buyer in the form of the municipal government, which kicked in 16.5 million (more) euros. In April 2022, family-owned Fassmer and the Meyer shipyards split the purchase of Neptun Ship Design, which was previously part of MV Shipyards – saving 100 employees from a walk to the benefits office.

The other two sites, Wismar and Rostock, have not attracted buyers and remain idle. MV Shipyard’s last project was a 342-meter-long cruise ship called Global Dream. Destined for the Asian market, it remained incomplete when it was put up for auction in early 2022.

Lloyd Shipyard in Bremerhaven, also owned by Genting, filed for bankruptcy on the same day as MV Shipyards – but was soon acquired by family-owned Rönner Group and Gustav Zech Trust. While the Global Dream continues to languish in Wismar, Lloyd docked the Aida Aura for repairs. Carsten Sippel, the General Manager at Lloyd, noted that the “Market for ship repair in Northern Europe is very good. The demand for docking capacity is high.” There was no mention of newbuilds.

Genting’s German adventure is a common one in recent history. It entered the market with high hopes, sinking 100 million euros into beefing up the two shipyards. Genting wanted to capitalize on strong Asian demand. Tagesschau, the German government-funded news agency, ran a 2017 report titled: “MV Shipyards: Will the ‘Sick Man’ Turn into a ‘Global Player’?” It was true, the report admitted, that previous investors in shipbuilding had failed miserably, costing taxpayers and employees dearly. But surely Genting was made of sterner stuff. It had, after all, “paid the purchase price promptly.”

But fast payment is perhaps not the true shibboleth. Tagesschau’s analysis was incomplete: It takes more than a fistful of dollars and big aspirations to make a “Global Player.”

Recurring Nightmare

With MV Shipyards insolvent and Lloyd sold off to yet another German Mittelstand company, it looks like the dream of ships built in Europe for the Asian market is more of a recurring nightmare. Asian yards long ago cracked the code and have been the first port of call for cost-conscious European shipowners, but MV Shipyards and Lloyd show how hard it is to turn a profit in the other direction.

And Asian shipyards have proven themselves adept at turning out lovely cruise ships and yachts, too: Note the Shanghai-built, 135,000 gross ton Vista-class for Carnival Cruise Lines, which floated out last year.

The combination of high costs – for labor, regulatory and environmental compliance – and generous, top-down subsidies have created a structural environment wherein European shipyards can remain operational but not profitable. And there’s plenty of demand for cruise ships and yachts, especially ones with the German seal of quality for which one does not even need to pay the full market price.

Germany is not alone in supporting its shipyards. With an 84 percent share, France’s government is the main owner of Chantiers de l’Atlantique. Italy’s Cassa Depositi, part of the country’s Ministry of Finance, is the biggest shareholder of Fincantieri. In other words, both are effectively state-owned enterprises.

Together, Fincantieri and Chantiers de l’Atlantique employ 13,000 workers. Both cater heavily to the cruise industry with Fincantieri in talks with Norwegian Cruise Lines for $4 billion in orders this year and Chantiers de l’Atlantique building for Royal Caribbean, among others.

In this European round-robin tournament where national governments fight each other via their subsidized or directly owned shipyard proxies, the biggest losers are the taxpayers. An alternative would be to allow these companies to consolidate or disappear from the market entirely.

In that scenario, it would at least mean that the winners and losers would be the companies, as the market dictates, and not the taxpayers. But cleaning out a supply glut is never enjoyable, and no European government wants to pull the plug first.

The way out of this morass may have an historical parallel in Airbus Industrie. Likewise a heavily subsidized, government-steered company, Airbus has become the world’s biggest airplane manufacturer.

It was formed by merging various smaller national champions. British Aerospace, German DASA, French Aerospatiale and Spanish Construcciones Aeronauticas were among the companies that came together under a complex agreement about where factories would be sited, which countries would be responsible for which stages of work and how development would be organized. The result has been a cumbersome but effective behemoth that at least arguably spends its public money more smartly.

After all, Airbus caters to military demand with, for example, the Eurofighter Typhoon, a multirole fighter, various helicopters and the A-400M Atlas, a four-turboprop military transport aircraft. An argument for Airbus is and was that Europe wanted to retain strategic capability for its own security. The same reasoning would apply to European shipyards, which supply warships to Europe’s navies.

Time to Let Go?

Transitioning Europe’s struggling shipyards into a single entity could benefit everybody so long as enough countries buy in and decide to realign their defense procurement along similar trajectories.

The current beneficiaries of this system are tourists and Russian billionaires, who can contract with loss-making shipyards for the cruise ships and yachts they desire. Isn’t it time to let that go?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999508857727051}",neutral,0.9999508857727051,0
Airbus Zephyr crashes short of endurance record - AOPA,"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVndXN0LzI5L2FpcmJ1cy16ZXBoeXItY3Jhc2hlcy1zaG9ydC1vZi1lbmR1cmFuY2UtcmVjb3Jk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The solar-powered drone was designed to fly continuously for months at a time at altitudes of up to 70,000 feet. The Zephyr 8 boasts an 82-foot wingspan and weighs just over 165 pounds. The Zephyr’s flight time is carbon neutral and uses rechargeable secondary batteries that charge in daylight to power overnight flights.

The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space (APNT/Space) Cross-Functional Team (CFT) launched the Airbus Zephyr on June 15 from the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in Arizona. After launch the Zephyr climbed to over 60,000 feet and flew over the southern portion of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America.

The record stands The current flight endurance world record was set in 1959 by two aviators in Las Vegas in a modified Cessna 172 sponsored by the Hacienda Hotel. The mission was planned and piloted by slot machine mechanic and former World War II bomber pilot Bob Timm to set a flight endurance record and advertise for the Hacienda Hotel. After three unsuccessful flight attempts, Timm partnered with a new co-pilot, aircraft mechanic and pilot John Cook. The two took off on December 4, 1958, and flew for 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and five seconds, over 150,000 miles. The Cessna 172 refueled its 92-gallon belly tank while flying just above a specially modified fueling truck on a long, straight stretch of road. Travelers passing through Harry Reid International Airport (formerly McCarran International Airport) can see the famous Skyhawk hanging from the ceiling.

The U.S. Army reported that after 64 days in flight, “On August 18 around 2100 hours PDT, the prototype aircraft’s flight campaign ended when the Zephyr 8 UAS encountered events that led to its unexpected termination over YPG. These events are under investigation. No injuries or risk to personnel or other aircraft resulted from this incident. Further information will be released following the investigation.”

Michael Monteleone, director of the APNT/Space CFT, said, ""Our team is working hard to gather and analyze important data following the unexpected termination of this flight. Despite this event, the Army and its partners have gleaned invaluable data and increased knowledge on the endurance, efficiency, and station keeping abilities of high-altitude UAS platforms. That knowledge will allow us to continue to advance requirements for reliable, modernized stratospheric capabilities to our Soldiers.”

A representative from Airbus Defense told Simple Flying, “Following 64 days of stratospheric flight and the completion of numerous mission objectives, Zephyr experienced circumstances that ended its current flight. No personal injury occurred. Our teams are currently analyzing more than 1,500 hours of stratospheric mission data. The valuable experience from this prototype’s ultra-long endurance flight has proved to be a positive step toward the Army’s high-altitude platform goals.""

The Zephyr achieved many firsts during its mission including more than doubling the previous UAS endurance record of just under 26 days and flew more than 30,000 nautical miles. Other firsts reported by the Army include “its departure from U.S. Airspace, flight over water, flight in international airspace, data collection and direct downlink while outside of U.S. airspace, the longest continuous duration (7 days) utilizing satellite communications, and the demonstration of resilient satellite command and control from three different locations—Huntsville, AL; Yuma, AZ; and Farnborough, UK.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999663829803467}",neutral,0.9999663829803467,0
Can Emirates Convince Airbus to Build a New A380? - Airways Magazine,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLW5ldy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Can Emirates Convince Airbus to Build a New A380?

DALLAS – 118 Airbus A380s, 80 actively flying, with the rest to join by the coming spring, and still, mega carrier Emirates (EK) says they’re just not enough. It’s hard to say that many of the world’s largest jets wouldn’t be enough, but upon hearing EK’s CEO, maybe it’ll convince you.

Emirates is the true master of the hub and spoke, and does so with the largest available fleet of jets in the market. The A380 has been their best buy and hasn’t failed to disappoint but has done so for nearly all other carriers. Given the A380 production is no more, EK seems to have hit a roadblock for the future. Demand speculation is surging and only a really large aircraft can help Emirates get the job done.

The Airbus A350-1000 is the largest jet Airbus has in store today and for Boeing, the 777-9 is yet to hit the market. Both these carriers seat approximatley100 less than the A380.

“The notion that the A380 was a spent force was always a little bit of a difficult one for us to swallow,” Emirates CEO Tim Clark told CNN Travel.

“I was chuckling to myself, thinking ‘Wait and see.’ We started flying the A380 into Heathrow six times a day in October of last year, and we haven’t had a [free] seat on any of them since.”

“The math tells you that you need a big unit, much bigger than we’re getting at the moment,” he says.

“The biggest one will be the 777-9, whenever that comes to market, which in our configuration [will seat] 364 people against 484 on the A380s with our new premium economy. And it was 519 before, so you get where I’m coming from.”

Listen to this article:

Emirates’ Dire Need for a Large Aircraft

Emirates expects that pre covid demand would increase another half in the coming decade and questions how it can commute such numbers if there isn’t a jet in proportion.

“Even with multiple 787s and A350s all busy flying around the world, I still don’t get how you will pick up that growth curve,” says Clark.

“Supply will be suppressed, demand will continue to grow, and when that happens prices rise, it’s inevitable.

“If you take the A380s out of the frame by the mid-2030s, how are you going to make it work? Do we see massive upgrades of airfields or new airfields?

While the current fleet of superjumbos will remain flying until the mid-2030s, EK has to look for a replacement and has done so by ordering a bunch of A350 and the 777X, of course, it’s sure to disappoint EK but its the only option unless Airbus or for that matter of fact Boeing, come up with a giant.

“I’ve spoken to Airbus more than once,” he says. “I think they’re beginning to take it a little bit more seriously, but at the moment they are concentrating on their single-aisle planes and the A350 line.”I see strong demand for the next year,” he adds.

Emirates A380 to Bangalore

Until now, EK flew to India’s fastest growing airport Bangalore with the Boeing 777s but come 30 October, one of the three daily flights will be flown by the superjumbo.

This will also be the first A380 to commence scheduled operation to BLR.

Airbus' Zephyr drone test unexpectedly halted after two months aloft - C4ISRNET,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLzA4LzIzL2FpcmJ1cy16ZXBoeXItZHJvbmUtdGVzdC11bmV4cGVjdGVkbHktaGFsdGVkLWFmdGVyLXR3by1tb250aHMtYWxvZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Testing of Airbus’ Zephyr drone unexpectedly concluded after completing a record 64 days aloft following an incident at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, according to U.S. Army Futures Command.

Further flight demonstrations of the solar-powered, uncrewed aircraft have been postponed until 2023.

“Our team is working hard to gather and analyze important data following the unexpected termination of this flight,” Michael Monteleone, the director of the command’s Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space Cross-Functional Team, said in a statement.

The team launched the aircraft June 15 and it remained flying until Aug. 18 when it “encountered events that led to its unexpected termination,” according to the command. The Zephyr drone shattered its own longevity record for time spent aloft as an uncrewed aircraft system in the process.

The events are under investigation, and further information will be released once the review is complete. No injuries or risk to personnel or other aircraft resulted from the incident.

“Despite this event, the Army and its partners have gleaned invaluable data and increased knowledge on the endurance, efficiency, and station keeping abilities of high-altitude UAS platforms,” Monteleone said. “That knowledge will allow us to continue to advance requirements for reliable, modernized stratospheric capabilities to our soldiers.”

During its time airborne, the Zephyr more than doubled the previous unmanned aerial system endurance record, just less than 26 days, and beat all known UAS endurance records.

The Zephyr has a wingspan of just over 82 feet but weighs less than 166 pounds. Testing sought to assess the aircraft’s durability and energy storage capacity.

Postponement of future testing is needed given the amount of data generated during the flight and the time required to analyze it, as well as the need to investigate the event, Army Futures Command said.

The command previously said it would launch a second Zephyr flight this summer that would travel over the Pacific Ocean in order to study its ability to carry a payload designed by the Army over multiple combatant commands.

James Darcy, a spokesperson for Airbus, did not immediately return a request for comment.

"Occidental Sells 400,000 Tons Of Carbon Credits To Airbus In Landmark Deal - Carbon Herald","Thu, 18 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9vY2NpZGVudGFsLXNlbGxzLWNhcmJvbi1jcmVkaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Occidental Petroleum’s subsidiary 1PointFive announced on March 17th a new deal with Airbus for the purchase of 400,000 tons of direct air capture (DAC) carbon credits. The carbon credits come from its planned major project – a large-scale facility using Carbon Engineering’s direct air capture technology with the expected capacity of permanently sucking and storing 1 million tons of CO2 per year.

The agreement involves a pre-purchase of the capture and permanent sequestration of 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year in the course of four years. The Occidental carbon credits deal allows for more volume to be secured in the future. The investment value was not disclosed.

“We’re proud to partner with Airbus on an enormous opportunity to help the aviation industry and other hard-to-abate sectors decarbonize… Direct Air Capture will be a scalable, practical solution that aerospace pioneers like Airbus can integrate into their decarbonization roadmaps to contribute to climate action,” said 1PointFive CEO Michael Avery.

Such an investment influx would allow Occidental to move ahead with its project that would be the world’s largest plant designed to capture CO2 out of ambient air via direct air capture technology. Last year, Climeworks launched the world’s largest so far direct air capture plus storage plant named “Orca” in Iceland. However, its capacity is far lower than Occidental’s planned project – 4,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually.

The construction of 1PointFive’s DAC facility is expected to begin in the second half of 2022 in the Permian Basin. The exact location is still not known and neither is the potential cost of the project. According to the IEA, its expected annual removal capacity would make it 100 times bigger than the combined capacity of the 19 DAC plants currently operating worldwide.

The investment coming from a major client like Airbus signals the growing demand for high-quality carbon removal from the industry. Hard to decarbonize sectors like aviation are in a need to offset their emissions and find the most feasible pathway towards decarbonization. Direct air capture is a carbon negative technology that provides permanent removal of CO2 and is considered one of the most viable solutions to the climate change crisis known today.

DALLAS – Malaysia Airlines (MH) has announced an order for 20 Airbus A330-900 aircraft as part of its widebody fleet renewal program.

The new aircraft are set to replace the airline’s aging fleet of 21 A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft, which are deployed on short to medium haul routes to cities in Asia, the Pacific, and the Middle East.

According to a press release detailing the order, the new aircraft will be fitted with a two-class layout with 300 seats, compared to the 290 offered by the airline’s A330-300 aircraft.

As part of the deal, 10 of the aircraft will be directly purchased from Airbus, while the remaining 10 will be leased from Avolon.

The Airbus A330neo has become a popular option among airlines in Asia. MH will be joining A330neo operators Starlux Airlines (JX), Lion Air (JT), Garuda Indonesia (GA), Cebu Pacific (5J), and Thai AirAsia X (XJ).

Boeing to Airbus

As MH has continued to evolve, the airline has moved away from operating Boeing widebody aircraft to Airbus.

Although the airline had previously operated large fleets of Boeing 747 and 777 aircraft, the airline has moved to Airbus A330 and A350 aircraft for their medium to long-haul flights.

Now, the A330-900s will complement the airline’s small fleet of A350-900s that operate MH’s flagship routes. While the A350-900 aircraft are fitted with three-class seating, the A330-900s will not include a first-class product.

RunwaySense supports airports during monsoon - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9ydW53YXlzZW5zZS1zdXBwb3J0cy1haXJwb3J0cy1kdXJpbmctbW9uc29vbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"1,600+ aircraft committed to install BACF and more than 1,200 aircraft already flying with BACF 35,000+ BACF-ACARS messages 35,000 BACF-ACARS messages received globally per month 20+ airports have already subscribed to the RunwaySense Service

BACF provides 2 types of measurements

1. Friction limited measurements are generated when the braking force is friction limited mainly in case slippery conditions are encountered on the runway and this whatever the cause of the slipperiness (e.g. ice, snow, water, rubber, sand among others). This type of measurement is made available to the flight crew in the cockpit a few seconds after the landings so that it can be used for the Pilot Report of Braking Action. 2. Non-friction limited measurements are issued when the braking force that is reached is in line with the commanded level of braking. In these cases, BACF identifies the braking action on the runway is equal or better than a given braking action level.

2021 South-South East Asia monsoon highlights

In 2021, 6 different airlines issued BACF reports in South-South East Asia. Today we count more than 200 BACF-equipped aircraft being operated by these airlines that subscribed to the RunwaySense Service.

On 30th October 2021, the Government of India Ministry of Earth Sciences India Meteorological Department (IMD) published a press release "" Salient Features of Monsoon 2021 "" which explains the following: ""Considering month to month rainfall variation over India as a whole, the season is very uniquely placed in the historical record for its distinct and contrasting month to month variation. The rainfall over the country as a whole was 110%, 93%, 76% and 135% of Long Period Average “LPA” during June, July, August and September respectively. The IMD defines the LPA of rainfall as being the ""rainfall recorded over a particular region for a given interval (like month or season) averaged over a long period like 30 years, 50 years etc"".

It is interesting to note that there is a direct correlation between the monsoon season and the rainfall figures reported by the IMD on one side and the rate of BACF friction limited measurements on the other side:

In June 2021

The usual starting month for the monsoon season, the IMD reported that the rainfall over the country was 110% of the LPA whereas we observed an increase of 60%

In July 2021

the IMD reported that the rainfall over the country was 93% of the LPA whereas we observed a slight decrease of 7% of the rate of BACF friction limited measurements from June to July 2021.

In August 2021

The IMD reported that the rainfall over the country was 76% of the LPA whereas we observed a decrease of 60% of the rate of BACF friction limited measurements from July to August 2021.

In September 2021

The IMD reported that the rainfall over the country was 135% of the LPA whereas we observed an increase of 60% of the rate of BACF friction limited measurements from August to September 2021.

The highest rates of BACF friction limited measurements were observed in June and in September, the same months where the IMD reported the highest percentage of rainfall. This observation tends to show the effectiveness of BACF in detecting slippery conditions in case of heavy rainfall.

Practical example of correlation between the weather conditions evolution and the reports collected from BACF

At a given airport and on a given day during the monsoon season of 2021, the METAR data were correlated with the BACF reports. At this airport, during the whole day, the reported temperature was oscillating between 26°C and 28°C. METAR - From 0:00 UTC to 4:30 UTC, light intensity rain and haze were reported.

- From 0:00 UTC to 4:30 UTC, light intensity rain and haze were reported. BACF - At 3:02 UTC, a “non-friction limited” BACF report was generated further to the landing of a BACF equipped aircraft. BACF reported that the braking action was “at least GOOD TO MEDIUM” on a 200 meters length portion of the runway.

- At 3:02 UTC, a “non-friction limited” BACF report was generated further to the landing of a BACF equipped aircraft. reported that the braking action was “at least GOOD TO MEDIUM” on a 200 meters length portion of the runway. METAR - From 4:30 UTC, thunderstorms with heavy rain were reported. The degradation of the weather conditions consequently led to the degradation of the braking action level measured by BACF. 2 consecutive “friction limited” reports were collected. BACF - At 4:29 UTC, BACF reported that the braking action was “GOOD TO MEDIUM” over a portion of about 200 meters length.

- At 4:29 UTC, BACF reported that the braking action was “GOOD TO MEDIUM” over a portion of about 200 meters length. BACF - At 4:35 UTC, BACF reported that the braking action was “MEDIUM TO POOR” over a portion of about 100 meters length. As per the ICAO RCAM (Runway Condition Assessment Matrix), a “MEDIUM TO POOR” braking action corresponds to the following criteria in terms of runway surface description: “More than 3mm depth of water: standing water”. METAR - At 5:00 UTC, the METAR showed thunderstorms and rain instead of heavy rain (as previously reported).

​​​​​​​ BACF - At 5:18 UTC, BACF reported a braking action “At least GOOD TO MEDIUM” over a distance of about 300 meters.

- At 5:18 UTC, BACF reported a braking action “At least GOOD TO MEDIUM” over a distance of about 300 meters. METAR - At 5:30 UTC and 6:00 UTC, thunderstorms and heavy rain were reported again associated with gusting wind up to 16 knots. At 6:12 UTC a BACF equipped aircraft landed without generating any BACF report. The absence of report might be due to a low commanded braking force or might be linked to the improvement of the weather conditions as reported in the subsequent METARs. METAR - From 6:30 UTC and until 9:00 UTC thunderstorms were still present but associated with light rain.

- From 6:30 UTC and until 9:00 UTC thunderstorms were still present but associated with light rain. BACF - The next BACF report that was generated reported a braking action “GOOD TO MEDIUM” at 8:54 UTC.

- The next BACF report that was generated reported a braking action “GOOD TO MEDIUM” at 8:54 UTC. METAR - From 9:30 UTC onward, rain and light rain were reported without any further weather event to be highlighted.

- From 9:30 UTC onward, rain and light rain were reported without any further weather event to be highlighted. BACF - All BACF reports that were received during the rest of the day highlighted a braking action “at least GOOD TO MEDIUM”.

What are the benefits of RunwaySense while facing the monsoon season?

During the monsoon preparation phase

The BACF data can contribute to gaining a more robust and accurate understanding of the actual runway condition with regards to its effect on the aircraft braking performance. The granularity of the BACF measurements (down to 100 meters length) can help identify some specific sub-portions of the runway that might be more specifically subject to slippery conditions under certain conditions. This might help focusing the maintenance work on some specific areas of the runway.

During the monsoon period

BACF provides real time information about the runway condition without interfering with the airport traffic. The more aircraft equipped with BACF, the more frequent the BACF reports are and ultimately, the more accurate the picture about the runway condition evolution is at any point in time. In case of sudden degradation of the weather conditions, the airport awareness of slippery conditions caused by standing water will be enhanced. And on the contrary, the airport will also gain visibility in case the runway condition is improving which will contribute to increase runways availability as well as reduce potential delays and diversions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999858140945435}",neutral,0.9999858140945435,0

This is a significant milestone as MAG moves towards the successful execution of our Long-Term Business Plan 2.0 to position itself as a leading aviation services Group within the region.”

In addition to the renewal of the widebody fleet, Airbus and MAG also signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to study a wider collaboration in the areas of sustainability, training, maintenance and airspace management.

Christian Scherer said: ""Malaysia Airlines is one of the great Asian carriers and we are proud and humbled to be its preferred supplier of widebody aircraft. The decision is a clear endorsement of the A330neo as the most efficient option in this size category for premium operations. It's also the clear winner in terms of in-flight comfort and we are looking forward to working with Malaysia Airlines to define an exceptional cabin experience.""

The A330neo is the new generation version of the popular A330 widebody. Incorporating the latest generation engines, a new wing and a range of aerodynamic innovations, the aircraft offers 25% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2-emissions. The A330-900 is capable of flying 7,200nm / 13,300km non-stop.

The A330neo features the award-winning Airspace cabin, providing passengers with a new level of comfort, ambience and design. This includes offering more personal space, larger overhead bins, a new lighting system and the ability to offer the latest in-flight entertainment systems and full connectivity. As with all Airbus aircraft, the A330neo also features a state-of-the-art cabin air system ensuring a clean and safe environment during the flight.

As at the end of July 2022, the A330neo has received more than 270 firm orders from over 20 customers worldwide","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9704580307006836}",neutral,0.9704580307006836,0
"Rob Dewar, ‘Father of the Airbus A220,’ inducted as a Living Legend of Aviation - Skies Magazine","Mon, 29 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9iLWRld2FyLWZhdGhlci1haXJidXMtYTIyMC1pbmR1Y3RlZC1saXZpbmctbGVnZW5kLWF2aWF0aW9uL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9iLWRld2FyLWZhdGhlci1haXJidXMtYTIyMC1pbmR1Y3RlZC1saXZpbmctbGVnZW5kLWF2aWF0aW9uLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Frederick K.

Estimated reading time 4 minutes, 43 seconds.

Another respected Canadian aerospace leader has been inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation. Rob Dewar of Airbus Canada became a member of that elite group at an awards ceremony near Salzburg, Austria, on Aug. 27. He joins more than 100 aviation-related engineers, pilots, entrepreneurs, managers, and celebrities including Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Tom Cruise, James Lovell, Elon Musk, and Frederick Smith. The other Canadians are Laurent Beaudoin and Marc Parent.

Equipped with bachelor of engineering and master of engineering degrees from McGill University, Dewar joined Canadair in May 1986. When Bombardier acquired Canadair in December that year, he continued to work on aircraft projects. A significant opportunity was presented to him in March 2004, when Bombardier created the New Commercial Aircraft Program (NCAP) to determine the potential viability of a new family of narrow-body jetliners. As one of NCAP’s first three employees, Dewar witnessed the creation of what would become the CSeries program. It was later renamed Airbus A220.

As vice president of CSeries Integrated Product Development, he was responsible for determining the market demand for 100- to 150-seat jet aircraft over the following two decades. His duties also included establishing the manufacturing process and the selection of key suppliers. Dewar was eventually named VP and general manager of the CSeries program. In that role, he oversaw the product’s development, manufacturing operations, supply chain, customer support, and international marketing efforts.

With 223 A220s delivered and 551 firm orders outstanding, the A220 program has confirmed the optimism expressed by its supporters when the prototype first flew on Sept. 16, 2013.

Since December 2019, Dewar has been Airbus Canada’s senior VP of A220 customer services, customer satisfaction and product policy. When asked recently by Skies what A220 issues are his priorities, he responded, “Increasing production, reducing costs, and supporting customers.”

The 100- to 150-seat market targeted by the A220 family appears to have significant growth potential. In its most recent forecast released in July, Airbus estimates that there will be global demand for at least 7,000 aircraft in that category over the next 20 years. Increasing passenger traffic and the replacement of aging aircraft are expected to be the key drivers.

If Airbus is to obtain a healthy share of that market, there will have to be an increased level of output at the two A220 facilities. The goal is to attain a monthly production rate of 10 units at Mirabel, Quebec, and four units at the Mobile, Alabama, plant by the end of 2025. That would represent an annual run rate of 168 units, up from the current 72 units per year. Furthermore, it is expected that the A220 program would be profitable at that point, thanks to the higher volumes and the implementation of cost-control programs.

Dewar, known as “The Father of the A220,” told Skies that he has been passionate about aircraft since he was a teenager, when he became “intrigued about how they could fly.” Appropriately, he soon learned to fly.

Canada’s latest “Living Legend of Aviation” has already been suitably honored by a customer. The first A220 of JetBlue Airways (N3008J/serial number 55099) wears his name. Like the A220, Dewar is a Canadian aerospace icon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999837875366211}",neutral,0.9999837875366211,0

Six More Airbus A321 Freighter Conversions for Qantas - Airways Magazine,"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vc2l4LW1vcmUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtcDJmLXFhbnRhcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Six More Airbus A321 Freighter Conversions for Qantas

DALLAS – To address rising e-commerce demand from its clients, Qantas Freight (QF) will expand its domestic fleet with six Airbus A321 passenger to freighter (P2F) aircraft.

The A321s, which are scheduled to gradually arrive between 2024 and mid-2026, will be purchased on the open market and converted to freighters, according to the Australian airfreight airline.The removal of seats and installation of a freight handling system are part of this modification project.

Qantas’ five Boeing 737 freighters in the long-term fleet, which are nearing the end of their useful lives, will be replaced by the A321. According to QF, each A321 freighter has a cargo capacity of 23 tonnes, nine tonnes more than the earlier 737s, and uses 30% less fuel per tonne of freight carried.

The remaining Boeing 737 freighters will be replaced by the three A321P2Fs, which the airline claims will result in increased training and maintenance efficiency.

Two widebody A330s are also being converted by QF into freighters, one of which will operate on the domestic network. Additionally, the cargo operation will keep adding wet-leased aircraft to its fleet as a supplement.

What Goes into Converting a Passenger Aircraft?

The standard modifications that Airbus performs for the A321P2F include the door cut-out and installation of the new reinforced door-surround structure, the revised hydraulic system and the simplified air distribution and water & waste system, the window plugs and deactivated doors & emergency exits, cockpit upgrades and other systems.

Depending on the Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN), the original passenger floor structure may be replaced by stronger cross beams and/or be partially reinforced.

Whereas the A330P2F uses a 9g net in the forward fuselage, the A321P2F is equipped with a Rigid Cargo Barrier (RCB) which incorporates a sliding door to allow access to the main deck cargo compartment.

Airbus explains, “To maximize the available main deck space the RCB is located at the most forward position possible, between the foremost left and right-hand doors (“Doors 1 L/R”). In turn, this necessitates the original door-surround structures to be removed and re-skinned, while the doors themselves are replaced by a simplified Crew Entry Door (CED), and the lavatory is replaced by a new one re-located to the right-hand side.”

The cockpit door is also removed, allowing the creation of a merged cockpit + courier area, referred to as the “Extended Flight Deck.” In addition, the A321’s “Doors 4” L/R are removed and reskinned, which is necessary to accommodate a 14th full-size container position without limitation.

According to Airbus, this setup thus provides the A321P2F with enough space to accommodate 14 cargo containers measuring 88-inches x 125-inches (or pallets) on the main deck.

Comments from Qantas Group CEO

Qantas Group chief executive Alan Joyce said, “Qantas Freight plays a vital role in Australia’s supply chain and this investment will grow our operations so they can support increased demand for next-day delivery.”

“Qantas Freight has been one of the standout performers for the Group during the pandemic as Australians rapidly shifted to online shopping. While some of that shift is temporary, demand remains well-above pre-pandemic levels even with the lifting of almost all Covid-related restrictions.”

“This is one of the largest ever investments in our domestic freight fleet, that will enable Qantas Freight to capture more of that demand and will provide the opportunity to help Freight further grow revenue and earnings.”

Qantas and Atlas Air recently announced an extension of their agreement under which the latter will provide long-haul, widebody main-deck capacity using two Boeing 747-400Fs to support supply chains in Australia, Asia, and the US. Additionally, a 747-400F contract has been expanded to cover a route connecting the US, Australia, and Hong Kong.

The initial agreements cover the acquisition of 20 A330-900 aircraft, with 10 to be purchased from Airbus and 10 to be leased from Dublin-based Avolon.

The announcement was made at an event in Kuala Lumpur, attended by MAG CEO Izham Ismail and Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International Christian Scherer, who signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the aircraft to be ordered from Airbus. The agreements with engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce and Avolon were also signed at the ceremony.

Powered by the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the A330neo will join the carrier’s fleet of six long range A350-900s and gradually replace its 21 A330ceo aircraft. The carrier will operate the A330neo on its network covering Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East. Malaysia Airlines will configure its A330neo fleet with a premium layout seating 300 passengers in two classes.

Izham Ismail said: “The acquisition of the A330neo is a natural transition from our current A330ceo fleet. The A330neo will not only provide fleet modernisation and enhanced operational efficiency, but will also meet environmental targets through reduced fuel-burn per seat, while keeping passenger safety and comfort at its core.

While it will take a bit of time for investigators to determine what caused this failure, most of these types of failures can be attributed to mechanical issues in the engine, such as turbine or oil leaks and related mechanical breakdowns, as well as external conditions such as contamination, bird strikes or unusual weather conditions (such as heavy precipitation). While none of the aforementioned conditions can be confirmed as of this writing, investigators will look at all possible causes.

Since this appears to be a contained engine failure, there was no additional damage to the aircraft, other than the damage that occurred to the engine which ultimately caused the failure.

Thankfully, no injuries to passengers or crew were reported at the time. The investigation continues.

Airbus Corporate Jets says global business aircraft departures in June up 17.2% than June 2019

On average business aircraft were used for 25 hours in January 2022, increased to 27 hours in June 2022.

Analysis of industry data by Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) shows a strong recovery in the global business aviation market. The latest data shows the number of global business aircraft departures in June was 17.2% higher than in the same month in 2019. January, February, March, April and May 2022 saw increases of 11%, 15%, 17.9%,15.7% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019.

On a regional basis, the U.S., which is the world’s biggest business aviation market, saw increases of 9.3%, 13.7%, 17.7%, 15.1%, 11.7% and 14.4% in departures in January, February, March, April, May and June this year, when compared to the corresponding months in 2019. In Europe, the corresponding increases are 11.8%, 16.4%, 14.8%, 15.2%, 20.6% and 20.5% for the same months.

The use of business aircraft is also increasing. On average, business aircraft were used for 25 hours in January, which increased to 27 hours in June. The corresponding figures for Europe were 20 hours and 26 hours; in the U.S., they were 24 hours and 25 hours.

The top 10 airports for business aircraft departures in both Europe and the U.S. have significantly increased the number of departures compared to 2019. The three busiest airports in Europe for business aircraft departures are Paris-Le Bourget, Nice-Côte d’Azur and Geneva Cointrin, and they saw increases in the first six months of this year (January to June 2022) of 20%, 20% and 19% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019.

The 10 busiest airports in the U.S. for business aircraft departures have also seen a traffic increase. In June, for example, Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles saw the number of large business aircraft departures rise by 35.6% compared to the same period in 2019.

“The global business aviation sector is enjoying a strong recovery from the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, and this is evident in the two biggest markets – the U.S. and Europe,” said Sean McGeough, VP Commercial, ACJ North America. He added, “Departures are up, and the use of business aircraft is increasing. Growth is also being driven by innovation and a growing focus on sustainability. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth in the ultra-long-range business jet market, especially with our new addition – the ACJ TwoTwenty. This aircraft has created a new market segment – the Xtra Large Bizjet – which includes a unique flexible cabin catalog, addressing the requirements of the heavy and long-range business jet categories. Put simply, it offers a unique value proposition: ultimate comfort at market-leading economics.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999902248382568}",positive,0.9999902248382568,1
United Eyes Airbus and Boeing Jets for First Widebody Order in 4 Years - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC91bml0ZWQtZXllcy1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1qZXRzLWZvci1maXJzdC13aWRlYm9keS1vcmRlci1pbi00LXllYXJzL9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC91bml0ZWQtZXllcy1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1qZXRzLWZvci1maXJzdC13aWRlYm9keS1vcmRlci1pbi00LXllYXJzLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United Airlines is in the market for new Airbus or Boeing widebody aircraft to update its large and aging fleet of twin-aisle planes, Airline Weekly has learned.

While the size and timing of a potential order are unknown, United executives told pilots in a town hall earlier in August that they are “looking at widebody requirements and opportunities now and may have recommendations later this year.” A deal could include replacements for United’s Boeing 767 and older 777 fleets, they noted.

The Chicago-based carrier is considering both the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 for a potential order, Airline Weekly understands. United has firm orders for 45 A350-900s with deliveries from 2027, and eight 787-10s due this year and next.

A spokesperson for United declined to comment on the potential widebody order.

Any deal would come on the heels of Boeing resuming 787 deliveries earlier in August after a more than year-long hiatus due to production quality issues. And a year-and-a-half after United placed a massive 270 aircraft order for Airbus A321neo and Boeing 737 Max planes.

Widebody aircraft, the mainstay of long, intercontinental routes, were largely grounded during the pandemic when countries imposed strict Covid-19 border restrictions. As travel resumed, airlines brought back narrowbody planes first and, in a rush to capture the expected rebound in demand and to replace aging jets, have ordered hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing models. The race to add more narrowbodies appears to be easing with executives at both Airbus and Boeing saying in July that they are seeing increased interest from airlines in new widebody aircraft.

In the U.S., United is arguably the most in need of new twin-aisle jets. The airline did not retire any older models during the pandemic as American Airlines and Delta Air Lines did, and — with only eight widebodies due between now and 2027 — lacks the near-term orderbook of its competitors. American had 43 787s on order at the end of June, and Delta 41 A330neos and A350s; both airlines expect many of these planes in the next five years.

The average age of United’s twin-aisle fleet is 15.8 years, compared to 12.7 years at American and 16.4 years at Delta, according to Cirium’s Fleets Analyzer database.

United’s oldest widebodies are its 38 767-300ERs with an average age of 25.9 years, and its 19 777-200s with 24.5 years at the end of December, according to its latest fleet plan. The carrier’s 16 767-400ERs and 55 777-200ERs are also on average more than 20 years old.

The industry generally views the useful life of an aircraft to be 20 or 25 years, after which it is a good candidate for replacement and retirement. However, many airlines, including Delta and United, fly planes for as much as 30 years to save on the cost of buying new aircraft.

For the 767, United executives referred to it during the town hall as a “difficult airplane to replace,” in what appears to be a reference to its lack of a direct replacement. Both Airbus’ A330-800 and Boeing’s 787-8 have more range and capabilities than most airlines need to replace 767-300ERs, a mainstay of thinner transatlantic routes. Delta has yet to select a 767 replacement, while American opted for fleet commonality in its 2018 selection of the 787-8 as a replacement.

For the 777s, one factor that could influence United’s decision-making process is a promised performance upgrade to the 787-10. In the works since at least 2019, Boeing is planning to raise the maximum takeoff weight of the aircraft to as much as 572,000lb from the current 560,000lb, according to The Air Current. The additional takeoff weight would give the -10, the largest member of the 787 family that slots in size between the 777-200 and 777-300ER, a “major boost in endurance and productivity,” including either additional range or payload.

Additional range could make the 787-10 attractive to United for transpacific routes where many of its older 777s fly today. The aircraft, while good for shorter flights to Europe with high demand, can fly some routes to Asia today but could require weight restrictions to do so. United operates 13 -10s and expects deliveries of the remaining eight it has on order to resume in September with five due this year, and three in 2023.

“We are developing an increased maximum takeoff weight plan for the 787-9 and 787-10 that will add additional value for our customers with even greater efficiency, flexibility and capability,” a Boeing spokesperson said. “We are currently working to incorporate this offering into production and are communicating with our customers on timing.”

Airbus’ A350 already has the capability to fly routes to both Asia and Europe nonstop from the U.S. The planemaker made a performance upgrade to the A350-900 for Delta that allows the aircraft to fly nonstop to both Australia and South Africa without restrictions.

Listen to this article:

DALLAS — The Airbus A319ceo took to the skies for the first time today, in 1995. The flight departed the manufacturer’s Hamburg-Finkenwerder (XFW) facility and lasted three hours and 50 minutes.

In command was Airbus Test Pilot Udo Günzel, joined by Claude Lelaie, Vice President Flight Division, Flight Test Engineers Fernando Alonso and Manfred Birnfield, and Flight Engineer Gérard Desbois.

“Behaved Perfectly”

Following the flight, Captain Günzel said: “The A319 behaved perfectly on its first flight and confirmed the high standard of Airbus Industrie technology. We all felt very familiar and comfortable flying it, due to its extensive commonality and similarity with the other members of the family.”

The A319 is part of the European planemaker’s A320 family. Launched at the 1993 Paris Air Show, the shortened version of the A320 was developed as a direct competitor to the Boeing 737-300 and 700. It carries between 124 and 156 passengers in a two-class configuration or 156 in a high-density layout popular with low-cost airlines.

Service Entry

French domestic carrier Air Inter (IT) was the first to commit to the type when it placed an order for six in February 1994. It entered service with Swissair (SR) in April 1996.

Airbus announced the A319neo (new engine option) in December 2010. The variant took to the skies for the first time on March 31, 2017. In February 2022, Airbus delivered the maiden example to launch customer China Southern (CZ)

Etihad Airways scales up its cargo operations with Airbus' new generation A350F freighter - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLTA4LWV0aWhhZC1haXJ3YXlzLXNjYWxlcy11cC1pdHMtY2FyZ28tb3BlcmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1uZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@Airbus @Etihad #A350F #A350-1000

UAE, Abu Dhabi 3 August 2022 – Etihad Airways has firmed up its order with Airbus for seven new generationA350F freighters, following its earlier commitment announced at the Singapore Airshow. The freighters will upgrade Etihad’s freight capacity by deploying the most efficient cargo aircraft available in the market.

This order of the A350F sees the national carrier of the UAE expanding its relationship with Airbus, and adding to its existing order of the largest passenger version of A350-1000s, five of which have been delivered.

Tony Douglas, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said:

In building one of the world’s youngest and most sustainable fleets, we are delighted to extend our long-term partnership with Airbus to add the A350 Freighter to our fleet. This additional cargo capacity will support the unprecedented growth we are experiencing in the Etihad Cargo division. Airbus has developed a remarkable fuel-efficient aircraft that, in tandem with the A350-1000 in our passenger fleet, supports our commitment to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“Airbus is delighted to extend its long standing partnership with Etihad Airways, who recently introduced the A350 passenger services and is continuing to build on the Family with the game-changing freighter version, the A350F,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “This new generation large freighter brings unprecedented and unmatched benefits in terms of range, fuel efficiency and CO₂ savings, that support customers by enhancing operational efficiencies at the same time as reducing environmental impact.”

Etihad has also firmed up a long term agreement for Airbus’ Flight Hour Services (FHS) to support its entire A350 fleet, to maintain aircraft performance and optimise reliability. This marks the first agreement for an Airbus FHS contract for an A350-fleet in the Middle East. Separately, Etihad has also opted for Airbus'Skywise Health Monitoring, allowing the airline to access real-time management of aircraft events and troubleshooting, saving time and decreasing the cost of unscheduled maintenance.

As part of the world’s most modern long-range family, the A350F provides a high level of commonality with the A350 passenger versions. With a 109 tonne payload capability, the A350F can serve all cargo markets. The aircraft features a large main deck cargo door, with its fuselage length and capacity optimised around the industry’s standard pallets and containers.

More than 70% of the airframe of the A350F is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 30 tonne lighter take-off weight and generating at least 20% lower fuel consumption and emissions over its current closest competitor. The A350F fully meets ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards coming into effect in 2027. Including today’s commitment the A350F has won 31 firm orders by six customers.

The A350F meets the imminent wave of large freighter replacements and the evolving environmental requirements, shaping the future of air freight. The A350F will be powered by the latest technology, fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998396635055542}",positive,0.9998396635055542,1
Airbus Cancels A350 Aircraft Contract With Qatar Airways: Reuters - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 04 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtY2FuY2Vscy1hMzUwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNvbnRyYWN0LTEyMTcyNjUzOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a stunning turn in a dispute threatening World Cup preparations, Airbus SE (OTC: EADSY) has canceled all of Qatar Airways' outstanding orders for A350 aircraft, cutting off all future jetliner business with the Gulf carrier, reported Reuters, citing industry sources.

Six months ago, Airbus also terminated the entire deal for 50 A321neo aircraft in retribution for Qatar's refusal to accept A350 deliveries.

After having nearly half of its A350 aircraft grounded due to premature surface damage, Qatar Airways filed a lawsuit against Airbus for at least $1.4 billion.

The scarred condition of more than 20 long-haul jets, which the airline claims could pose a risk to passengers but which Airbus believes are fully safe, has been the subject of a rare public spat between the two aviation giants for months.

Airbus has admitted quality issues with the aircraft, supported by European regulators, but has refuted any safety danger from holes in the protective sub-layer, claiming there is a sufficient backup.

The report added that Airbus told the airline it is striking the rest of the A350 deal from its books.

Price Action: EADSY shares closed higher by 1.94% at $26.48 on Wednesday.

Overview: Data for Flight Forecasting

AirSense, an advanced analytics solution enabled by the defense and space division of Airbus, aims to increase the accuracy of their estimated flight times and time of arrivals leveraging historical flight path data.

Challenge: Annotating Data with Accuracy

To reach a high level of accuracy, Airbus needed to annotate thousands of flight paths based on historical GPS data. Each flight path consists of a sequence of coordinates called a ‘cluster,’ and those coordinates needed to be labeled in the correct order to ensure accuracy and reduce the margin of error. A cluster also has several variations due to the various flight paths; short-haul, long-haul, diverted routes, etc. The project required speed, scale and quality to deliver success.

Solution: Quality Data Annotation with Speed

Our Appen Data Annotation Platform provided Airbus with the quality and speed needed to scale their computer vision project. Airbus trained our onsite team of annotators through video and constant feedback to ensure high-accuracy of image annotations. The tasks required annotators to map the beginning, middle, and end of the flight path. They also needed to coordinate a position on the image with a GPS coordinate. The platform’s quality assurance tools allowed the Airbus team to review the data quickly and accurately.

Result: Successful Pilot Launch

Using Appen’s data annotation with our onsite annotation services, Airbus was able to securely and accurately annotate thousands of images. due to the collaboration with Airbus and Appen teams, the pilot project successfully launched with 98% accuracy.

"China's C919 poised to challenge Boeing, Airbus - Asia Times","Wed, 03 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4L2NoaW5hcy1jOTE5LXBvaXNlZC10by1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s C919 narrowbody passenger jet has completed all test flights, bringing the plane a step closer to receiving an airworthiness certificate for commercial operations in China.

Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac), founded in 2008 and headquartered in Shanghai, has spent almost seven years testing its self-developed C919 airliner, which ultimately aims to compete with France’s Airbus A320 and America’s Boeing 737.

The company has submitted the C919 test results to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the country’s aviation regulator, and will then wait for official certification to fly. The C919’s official launch may take place in the next two years while mass production is expected to commence between 2027 and 2029.

Chinese state media trumpeted the successful test flights as a big milestone for China’s civil aviation industry, meaning that China now has the ability to assemble its own passenger flights.

The Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times quoted unnamed market observers as saying C919 had two key advantages, namely price and after-sale services, against foreign competitors for the local market.

Global Times said the aircraft’s price tag will be lower than that of comparable Boeing and Airbus aircraft, as it will be exempt from import duties, and that production and service teams will be based in China, which will provide convenience to Chinese airlines.

However, other Chinese media said the passenger jet could face obstacles if Comac is eventually banned from using US engines and parts.

Aero Engine Corporation of China, a state-owned enterprise, started developing China’s first turbofan engine known as CJ-1000A a decade ago. With parts and technologies supplied by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy, the company targeted to make breakthroughs on the project within five years.

Comac launched the C919 program in 2008 and planned to have the self-developed aircraft ready for commercial lift-off by 2016. But the launch was delayed and assembly of the first C919 prototype was only completed in late 2016.

The aircraft, which has 158-168 seats and a flight range of 4,075-5,555 kilometers, had its first trial flight in May 2017, marking the beginning of a five-year-long testing period.

Comac announced on Monday (August 1) that the C919 had completed all required trial flights and would be able to start its commercial operations after getting an airworthiness certificate from the CAAC.

Media reports said after Comac obtains an airworthiness certificate, it would have to spend another six to 12 months conducting demonstration flights on commercial routes and providing technical training for pilots and other relevant personnel. That means the C919’s official launch will likely be held between 2023 and 2024.

However, whether Comac would be able to start the mass production of C919 on schedule in 2027 was another matter altogether, analysts said.

Of the C919’s 82 primary suppliers, 48 are American companies while 26 are European firms, according to a report published by the Center For Strategic International Studies, a US-based think tank. That means 90% of the C919’s suppliers are Western companies.

The C919 airliner uses a high-bypass turbofan engine known as the leading edge aviation propulsion (LEAP), which is produced by CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture between American GE Aviation and French Safran Aircraft Engines.

It also uses an auxiliary power system, wheels and brakes, flight control package and navigation package supplied by Honeywell Technologies, a US company.

In late 2020, the Trump administration banned Comac from buying US aircraft parts because the firm allegedly had ties with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force.

A Chinese article titled “What if the US stops supplying engines for C919?” was widely circulated by Chinese websites last year.

The article said some people were doubtful whether C919 could be called “self-developed by China” as most of its parts were made by foreign companies. Others said such criticism was groundless as the most difficult part of making a plane was the assembly. It noted that even Boeing and Airbus used foreign-made parts.

The same article said Comac had to prepare for the possibility that the US could ban it from using CFM International’s LEAP engine. It said Comac had already started developing the CJ1000 engine several years ago and would probably be able to make breakthroughs within the next five years.

The CFM-made LEAP engine. Image: Twitter

It said by that time, C919 would enter its mass production phase and could use the CJ1000.

MTU Aero Engines, a German aircraft engine manufacturer, and Avio S.p.A., an Italian aerospace firm, had contributed to the development of the CJ1000 engine, according to previous reports.

GKN, a British automotive and aerospace component supplier, provided ACAE with the low-pressure turbine shafts for the CJ1000 project.

Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China, said it would take some time for C919 to accumulate a flying record before it could apply for airworthiness certificates overseas. Zou said it was too early to say when the C919 could be shipped globally.

Zou predicted annual demand for C919s in China would be about 300 units per year over the next 20 years. He predicted the C919’s market share would depend on the pace of its production and delivery.

Comac claims it has already received 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers worldwide.

Over 50% of all commercial jets operating in China are Boeing aircraft, and more than 10,000 Boeing aircraft currently fly around the world using Chinese-made components and assemblies, according to the official website of Boeing, the Global Times reported.

Airbus told the Global Times earlier that China is the largest single-country market for Airbus’ commercial aircraft and deliveries to the Chinese market last year represented over 20% of Airbus’ total deliveries worldwide, the same state media report said.

DALLAS – As part of the Biden administration’s sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Commerce Department has added 25 Airbus jets flown by Russian airlines to its list of suspected export violators on Tuesday, the agency said in a statement to Reuters.

More than 150 Boeing aircraft and one Gulfstream aircraft that have entered Russia from outside since March 2 or entered Belarus since April 8 have previously been identified by the department.

As per the Reuters report, the regulations apply to both domestically and internationally produced aircraft with at least a 25% U.S. origin content.

The Airbus planes in question are the first foreign aircraft to be included in the export control list.

Russian Airlines, Airbus Aircraft

Ural Airlines (U6), S7 Airlines (S7), Red Wings (WZ), Yamal Airlines (YC), Nordwind Airlines (N4), and I-Fly (F7) are among the airlines that fly the 25 Airbus A320, A321, and A330 aircraft. The orders are designed to prevent the airlines from receiving maintenance, replacement components, and refueling.

The department has issued warnings to businesses and other organizations all across the world, stating that any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services are in violation of U.S. export laws and are subject to enforcement by the government.

Major Russian airlines, including Aeroflot (SU), Aviastar (4B), Azur Air (ZF), N4, Pobeda (PD), Rossiya (FV), S7, and Utair (UT), as well as the flag carrier of Belarus, Belavia (B2), were previously denied export licenses by orders issued by the department.

Additionally, Businessman Roman Abramovich’s two aircraft, including a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, were previously named by the Commerce Department as having likely breached export regulations.

Emirates Wants Airbus To Design A New Kind Of A380 - One Mile at a Time,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWRlc2lnbi1uZXctYTM4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates President Tim Clark is one of the brightest and most reasonable guys in the airline industry. When he talks, it’s worth listening. Along those lines, he has just made some interesting comments about the future of “superjumbo” air travel.

Why the Airbus A380 was such a failure

Back in the 2000s, many believed that the Airbus A380 represented the future of air travel. As the demand for global air travel continues to increase, and as airports are increasingly capacity constrained, higher capacity jets are needed. Unfortunately that’s not how things have played out.

A380 production has already ended due to lack of demand — just over 250 of the planes were ever produced, and Emirates purchased around half of those. Emirates executives think the A380 is a brilliant aircraft, while most other A380 customers regret having purchased the jet.

The challenge for the A380 has been that we’ve seen Airbus and Boeing introduce smaller, long range, and fuel efficient jets, including the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. These airplanes are great, as they allow airlines to efficiently operate point-to-point long haul routes that may not have previously been economical.

So why has Emirates had such success with the A380, while virtually all other airlines haven’t?

Economies of scale are required to make the A380 work; you need a massive hub & spoke network to fill A380s, and having just a dozen A380s doesn’t really accomplish that

You need access to a lot of capital, and being owned by an oil rich country certainly helps with that

CEOs of publicly traded airlines are just conservative by nature; they generally won’t get blamed for things they don’t spend money on, while they will get blamed for things that they do spend money on

All too many A380s have already been scrapped

Tim Clark’s argument for a new A380 variant

Emirates took delivery of its last Airbus A380 in September 2021. Before A380 production stopped, Emirates President Tim Clark was vocal about asking Airbus to keep the A380 alive. We haven’t heard much from him about the jet since then… until now.

CNN Travel has an interview with Clark, where he’s once again talking about the long term need for an A380 equivalent, and how the plane could be even more efficient. The basis of his argument is that the demand for global air travel grew by around 4.5% per year pre-pandemic, and we’ll probably continue to see that level of growth in the future.

Here’s what Clark views as the problem with there not being any superjumbo planes in the pipeline:

“The notion that the A380 was a spent force was always a little bit of a difficult one for us to swallow.”

“I was chuckling to myself, thinking ‘wait and see.’ We started flying the A380 into Heathrow six times a day in October of last year, and we haven’t had a [free] seat on any of them since.”

“The math tells you that you need a big unit, much bigger than we’re getting at the moment. The biggest one will be the 777-9, whenever that comes to market, which in our configuration [will seat] 364 people against 484 on the A380s with our new premium economy. And it was 519 before, so you get where I’m coming from.”

“Even with multiple 787s and A350s all busy flying around the world, I still don’t get how you will pick up that growth curve. Supply will be suppressed, demand will continue to grow, and when that happens prices rise, it’s inevitable.

“If you take the A380s out of the frame by the mid-2030s, how are you going to make it work? Do we see massive upgrades of airfields or new airfields? At Heathrow, they can’t even agree on the third runway. Schiphol has just reduced the number of landings and takeoffs that they will allow. So, one wonders, how would this demand be accommodated?”

So, what’s the solution, according to Clark?

“Is it possible to redesign a new A380? Yes. Is it possible to lighten the aircraft? Yes. When they brought this aircraft to market, composites weren’t really [widespread]. Imagine a composite wing and a predominantly composite fuselage. Imagine engines that are giving you a 20 to 25% improvement compared to what you get today.”

“We’re trying to get everybody working on the big fans for the bigger aircraft as well. If you can get them to do what I think they could do in terms of fuel efficiency and power, then you have the makings of an airplane that would match or beat the economics of the [twin-engine aircraft] that we see today, by quite a long way.”

Clark is a realist, however, and acknowledges that this likely won’t be happening anytime soon:

“Do I think that airlines will step up and sign up to this project? Doubtful at this stage.”

“On the one hand I’m very keen to take a good hard look at this, on the other I’m not optimistic that the stakeholders in the ecosystem are up for it.”

“The airline industry is, rightly so, populated with people who are conservative in nature, because they’ve lost their shirts — this has been a seriously bad time for air travel. But now, things are starting to look a lot better, demand is back. So they have the ability to think hard about the future. Whether they’ve got the appetite for it, I don’t know. I know we have it.”

What does the future of flying shower suites look like?!

Bottom line

Emirates President Tim Clark is once again campaigning for the A380, in this case asking for a more efficient version of the jet. We’ve seen so much advancement with technology on other planes, between composite fuselages and wings, and more efficient engines. He feels that if a superjumbo would have the same investment in technology, it would make a lot of sense again, especially with demand for air travel continuing to grow.

In many ways new aircraft technology is also a race against the clock, with so many airlines promising virtually no net emissions within a couple of decades. While we’re seeing lots of new technology for smaller jets, this hasn’t extended to planes like the A380.

I’m definitely on #TeamClark here, but unfortunately I don’t see this gaining much traction.

What do you make of Clark’s comments about the need for the A380 in the future?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9781631827354431}",neutral,0.9781631827354431,0

Airbus Zephyr: 64 Days Non-Stop Flights Before Crashing in Arizona

(Photo : Airbus)

Simple Flying reported that Airbus' Zephyr aircraft that draws power from the Sun and has sustained a massive 64 days of non-stop flight already crashed in Arizona last August 19. The plane is a company project famous for manufacturing commercial aircraft that most airlines use for overseas and domestic transport.

Zephyr is an ""Unmanned Aerial Service"" (UAS) that the company designed to gather energy from the Sun and use it for sustaining its needs to power on flights it would take. The company launched it to test its systems more than two months ago, but it saw a systems failure that caused it to crash in the Arizona desert after its S-shaped maneuver for its testing.

Airbus Zephyr Did Not Break the Longest Flight Record

The Airbus Zephyr failed to beat the record of the longest flight in the world, focusing on the Cessna 172 Skyhawk that flew for 64 days and 22 hours before eventually landing. To date, it remains the longest flight in the world, but it had a crew inside the aircraft, unlike the Zephyr, which remains and acts like a drone.

Nevertheless, the Zephyr is a promising aircraft that can fly to great heights and gain power from an alternative, natural resource.

Drone Technology in the World Now

Drones are a massive focus in different industries now, as it aims to help in providing a chance for logistics companies to deliver in short distances like the one from Walmart. The future will see uncrewed systems and services in place for them, and drones are one to bring the feature for all, among other automated systems available.

However, its purpose and features do not stop there as it would also be applicable for surveillance like what the police are planning for it, focusing on a fleet to arrive soon. It aims to substitute the need for on-foot reconnaissance activities and gather intelligence for investigation needs, which would help avoid any risks and dangers for officers.

From its initial purpose of helping cinematography and videographers get aerial shots cheaper than going in helicopters or planes, drones evolved with more purpose and were used for their technology.

Now, there is a drone that aims to sustain its flight using only solar power from the natural resource that shines daily for the world. The Airbus Zephyr's story is not yet done here, as it will continue to develop and bring a sustainable uncrewed aircraft that may be used for different ventures without drawing much carbon emissions.

Airbus Helicopters eliminates tail rotor on future rotorcraft concepts - Flightglobal,"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWVsaW1pbmF0ZXMtdGFpbC1yb3Rvci1vbi1mdXR1cmUtcm90b3JjcmFmdC1jb25jZXB0cy8xNDk5NzUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters continues to eye novel architectures for future rotorcraft designs, including new compound and tail rotor-free configurations, patent applications reveal.

A pair of filings – published in recent weeks but applied for over the last two years – show the manufacturer attempting to address the drawbacks of current anti-torque systems.

Both outline concepts for an “improved anti-torque device that exhibits a comparatively low overall system complexity and a reduced overall weight” against existing solutions, it says.

Airbus Helicopters has traditionally opted for standard tail rotor designs on the majority of its rotorcraft, with the only excpetion its Fenestron ducted fan design that is used on certain models, including its newest helicopter, the H160 medium-twin.

For conventional rotorcraft, Airbus Helicopters proposes a passive anti-torque design that features an asymmetrical rear fuselage, a separate vertical support wing, and a box-shaped rear stabiliser arrangement.

These features would be configured to use the downwash from the main rotor in order to generate “sideward thrust”, says the application.

It suggests the rear fuselage could have a profile similar to a high-lift aerofoil, so that “comparatively high sideward thrust may already be generated at comparatively low downwash air speed”.

“This passive anti-torque device does not require any complex actuating mechanisms, thereby avoiding the weight and the need for redundancy of an active system,” it says, and would also reduce the “required maintenance effort”.

Additionally, the design does not incur the power loss associated with the operation of a conventional tail rotor while hovering – Airbus Helicopters says this is around 13% of the overall consumption – cutting fuel burn and increasing the power available.

Rudders could also be added to the vertical portion of the rear stabiliser arrangement, allowing control, potentially through the pedals, of the sideward thrust in forward flight, the patent filing says.

The horizontal part of the stabiliser would be at a height similar to that of a conventional T-tail, but with additional stiffness thanks to the box shape of the overall design. A vertical “support wing” – again with an aerofoil profile – would also connect the stabiliser to the engine deck of the helicopter.

Such a structure would be required “as there is no centre part of the rear section of the fuselage, compared to a tail boom of a conventional helicopter”.

By eliminating the need for a tail rotor and associated driveshaft, the design cuts weight and complexity and enables a radical reconfiguration of the helicopter’s aft section, opening up previously unusable space.

Airbus Helicopters also contemplates the addition of moveable canard-type wings on the forward fuselage to generate additional sideward thrust.

These would be vertically orientated during the hover to limit the impact of main rotor downwash, and then tilted through 90° to enable the generation of lift in forward flight; the canards could variously be independently adjusted or have different profiles to generate higher levels of lift as required.

Another application, filed in July 2021, outlines the manufacturer’s anti-torque solution for a compound rotorcraft.

Here a “shrouded duct” is positioned at the rear of the fuselage. This would be shaped to generate sideward thrust and also contain a propeller for use in forward flight.

The profile of the duct – its length, symmetry, angle-of-attack and position relative to the propeller disc – would be optimised for the generation of sidewards thrust and to minimise drag caused by the main rotor downwash, particularly during the transition from hover to forward flight.

An asymmetrical main fuselage could generate additional anti-torque performance from the main rotor downwash, the application states.

Indeed, similar to the design for the conventional rotorcraft, Airbus Helicopters proposes that the rear fuselage is shaped like a high-lift aerofoil in order to further increase generation of sideward thrust; a support wing is also envisaged.

While the manufacturer sees the potential to generate some anti-torque movement from the spinning propeller driveshaft, it also outlines a means of eliminating the part, suggesting that the propeller could instead be powered by a second engine situated at the rear of the helicopter.

This, it says, would enable “engine hybridisation” and increase redundancy.

Although the manufacturer has gone so far as to file patent applications for its designs, there is no guarantee they will make it into production.

To date, Airbus Helicopters’ interest in compound rotorcraft design has been confined to the Racer – a high-speed demonstrator aircraft being developed as part of the EU’s Clean Sky 2 programme.

In addition to the conventional main rotor, the Racer features twin pusher propellers mounted on V-wings for high-speed flight; it is due to perform a maiden sortie later this year.

That design is also the subject of a separate patent application, filed in December 2020, relating to the implementation of a floatation system for “a compound helicopter with braced wings in a joined-wing configuration”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999449253082275}",neutral,0.9999449253082275,0

Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), the parent company of the airline, will purchase 10 A330-900 aircraft from Airbus and lease a further 10 from Avolon, Airbus said in a press release on August 15, 2022.

The A330neo aircraft, which will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, will join the carrier’s fleet of six long range A350-900s and gradually replace its 21 A330ceo aircraft.

Avolon, which currently has four aircraft on lease to MAG, said the A330neo aircraft will be delivered from 2024 onwards. The transaction means Avolon has only two unplaced A330neos in its orderbook.

“As the Asian aviation market continues to emerge from the pandemic, this A330neo transaction will help MAG renew its fleet and position them to capitalise on market recovery,” Andy Cronin, Avolon CEO Designate, commented.

“The acquisition of the A330neo is a natural transition from our current A330ceo fleet,” MAG CEO Izham Ismail said. “The A330neo will not only provide fleet modernisation and enhanced operational efficiency, but will also meet environmental targets through reduced fuel-burn per seat, while keeping passenger safety and comfort at its core.”

Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International Christian Scherer commented: “Malaysia Airlines is one of the great Asian carriers and we are proud and humbled to be its preferred supplier of widebody aircraft. The decision is a clear endorsement of the A330neo as the most efficient option in this size category for premium operations.”

In addition to the order, Airbus and MAG also signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to study collaboration in the areas of sustainability, training, maintenance and airspace management.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999669790267944}",neutral,0.9999669790267944,0

The manufacturer revoked the remainder of the undelivered order, which consisted of 19 A350-1000 jets dedicated to joining Qatar Airways’ fleet, two unidentified sources confirmed to Reuters on August 3, 2022.

The recent is the latest development in the dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways over fuselage surface deterioration on A350 aircraft.

The disagreement began in late 2021. At the time, the airline sued the manufacturer with the aim of receiving up to $600 million in compensation. In response, Airbus attempted to terminate a separate delivery agreement, which involved 50 A321neo jets due to be delivered to the Doha-based carrier.

However, in April 2022, the court ruled in favor of Airbus, authorizing the planemaker to not fulfill its contractual obligation to deliver a separate order of A321neo jets to the airline.

As Qatar Airways had refused to take delivery of some of the A350s, the court also allowed the planemaker to sell the aircraft to other Airbus customers, arguing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ensured they are safe to be operated.

In mid-June 2022, the EU regulator announced it had not found any evidence that suggested paint or surface erosion on Qatar Airways’ order of A350s posed a safety concern.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9961147308349609}",negative,0.9961147308349609,-1

As part of the contract, the four-year course provided by GMR will include a fully integrated aircraft maintenance engineering (AME) licensing program at the GMR School of Aviation in Hyderabad.

The course will include two years' worth of classroom training and a two-year MRO training at GMR's facility followed by aircraft type training. Students fresh out of high school with physics and math as their majors can apply for the course.

This course-work is typically structured to fulfill the anticipated demand for over 45,000 new aircraft technicians in India over the next couple of decades as predicted by Airbus.

“India is rapidly evolving to become the largest aviation market by 2030 and to cater to this rising demand there will be a need for skilled professionals,” said Ashok Gopinath, CEO of GMR Aero Technic. “The GMR School of Aviation will help create a talent pool for engineering and maintenance solutions.""

India has an abundance of workforce, but not all technicians and engineers passing out of AME schools are qualified or trained as per industry standards. The basic idea behind this school is to establish an internationally recognized center of excellence.

Commenting on the partnership, Remi Maillard, president and managing director of Airbus India and South Asia said, “The partnership with GMR represents a significant deepening of MRO capabilities in India that are required to match the tremendous future demand for such services from the domestic aviation industry.”

The companies say that with Airbus as the knowledge partner, the operations and learning capacity of the school will be on par with international standards, which will give its graduates an edge in the MRO industry.

Airbus will provide the necessary software and courseware in the form of trainee handbooks, an examination database, online access to Airbus customized basic training modules and Airbus Competence Training. Airbus will also provide training to GMR instructors along with an assessment of the training center.

“Airbus will continue to contribute to the development of India’s wider aerospace ecosystem, including enhancing its manufacturing and services capabilities through its industrial footprint,” says Maillard.

Initially, there will be 100 students per batch, gradually expanding to the full capacity of 280 students. The school is expected to be operational by October or November this year.

Last year, Airbus and GMR signed a memorandum of understanding to explore collaboration opportunities across several strategic areas of aviation services, such as maintenance, components, training, and digital and airport services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9956815242767334}",neutral,0.9956815242767334,0

PARIS/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Malaysia Airlines is poised to announce a deal next Monday to acquire 20 Airbus A330neo wide-body jets, industry sources said on Wednesday.

Chief Executive Izham Ismail said in June the airline was nearing a decision on replacing its earlier-model A330 fleet, and Reuters last month reported that the upgraded A330neo had been selected as the preferred model.

The deal to replace 15 A330-300s and six A330-200s is likely to involve leasing around half of the upgraded A330neo planes and purchasing the rest directly from Airbus, said two of the sources, who were not authorised to speak publicly.

Malaysia Airlines and Airbus declined to comment.

Malaysia Airlines has Airbus A330s and A350s in its long-range fleet and had placed a provisional order for competing Boeing 787s in 2017, but let the deal lapse.

The fleet upgrade comes amid signs of a pick-up in demand for wide-body jets after a lengthy downturn.

AFC completed a live-flight demonstration of the aircraft that lasted 64 days; the longest recorded drone flight and nearly the longest recorded flight ever.

The Zephyr takes flight at Yuma Proving Ground (U.S. Army)

On June 15, 2022, the Zephyr was launched from U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. On August 19, the demonstration aircraft was lost somewhere over Arizona. The flight was just hours shy of becoming the longest flight in history. Still, Airbus and the Army collected valuable data from the flight which will help the service as it pursues future high-altitude long-endurance flights. ""Our teams are currently analyzing more than 1500 hours of stratospheric mission data,"" an Airbus Defense representative told Simple Flying. ""The valuable experience from this prototype’s ultra-long endurance flight has proved to be a positive step toward the Army’s high-altitude platform goals.""

During its record-setting flight, the Zephyr traversed airspace over the Southern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and even South America. The solar panels on the top of the aircraft absorb sunlight which is stored in its 53 pounds of lithium-ion batteries and powers its propellors both night and day. While the Zephyr's wingspan is an enormous 82 feet, it weighs just 165 pounds. With a payload capacity of 11 pounds, the Zephyr could be fitted with ISR or communications equipment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.989090621471405}",neutral,0.989090621471405,0

In nearly a decade of operation, it has become a staple in air force fleets across Europe.

1. The origins of the Atlas A400M date back to 1982 when a joint venture between leading aerospace designers Lockheed, BAe and Aérospatiale and Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm was formed with the goal of developing a replacement for the ageing C-130 and C-160 military transport aircraft.

Lockheed would eventually drop out in favor of developing the C-130J Super Hercules which is widely in service across the globe today. However, the European nations continued with their own development and, in 1999, Airbus Military delivered the Atlas C.1 A400M proposals.

2. Although now widespread within air force fleets including the RAF and the German Air Force, the Airbus Defence A400M program was nearly scrapped. Not only was the program years behind schedule and over budget, but reports suggested the aircraft was underdelivering on its performance and capabilities.

Nevertheless, the partner countries persevered and lent Airbus an additional €1.5 billion in funding to save the project. On December 11, 2009, the type took to the skies on its maiden flight before receiving its Certificate of Airworthiness from EASA in March 2013.

3. The A400M sits between the C130J Hercules and the larger Globemaster C-17 in terms of payload but is still as agile as the Hercules with takeoff and landing performance. It has a maximum range of 8,900 km, but with a higher payload of 30,000 kg it can fly up to 4,500 km.

The Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) is 141,000 kg compared to 70,000 kg for the C130J Super Hercules and 265,352 kg for the C-17. With a payload of 37,000 kg, the A400M is capable of carrying 116 fully equipped troops or paratroopers.

4. While already capable of air-to-air refueling for fixed wing aircraft including fast jets, Airbus is hoping to gain certification for refueling of rotary wing helicopters in the near future following successful trial flights. This would be a significant selling point for Airbus.

5. Uncommonly for aircraft, the propellers are counter-rotating – the two propellers on each wing spin in opposite directions. The benefits, along with increased lift and fuel efficiency, is reduced torque, which in the event of an engine failure allows greater directional control as the asymmetric yaw tendency is eliminated.

As a result, the Airbus is more fuel efficient at low altitude than the C-17 but faster than the Hercules at higher altitudes and is capable of flying up to Mach 0.72.

6. The Royal Air Force routinely conducts takeoff and landings using the A400M on a beach in South Wales on essential training exercises. Incredibly for its size, the A440M’s tactical takeoff and landing distances are 980 meters and 770 meters respectively.

7. The A400M has Automatic Low Level Flight capability. Initially approved for VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions), the type achieved a new milestone in May 2021, completing certification flights for IMC (Instrumental Meteorological Conditions).

The A400M uses navigation and terrain databases to navigate terrain with the autopilot and auto throttle engaged down to an altitude of 500 feet, all without the pilots needing external visual references, a first for military transport aircraft.

8. In May 2020, in a show of the A400Ms capabilities, the French Air Force deployed two of its fleet from France to Tahiti, French Polynesia during the Covid-19 pandemic, carrying essential supplies and cash to the island nations.

The A400M also made its first appearance in New Zealand, picking up French Polynesian nationals who were stranded in the country following strict lockdown measures.

9. The A400M is currently in service with Germany, France, Spain, UK, Turkey, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malaysia. France and Germany with 50 and 53 orders respectively will have the largest fleets.

The role of the Atlas A400M varies from logistical to MEDEVAC and repatriation. The hold can be transformed into a hospital ward with up to 66 stretchers and 25 medical personnel. The aircraft is also fitted with chaff and flare to counter missile attacks adding to its survivability on vulnerable missions.

10. To date, the A400M has amassed 178 orders, of which 105 have been delivered. In late 2021 and in a boost to the Airbus Defence Program, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Indonesian military each ordered two A400m, with the latter having options for a further four aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999654293060303}",neutral,0.9999654293060303,0
Airbus solar airplane crashes after 64 days of flying - pv magazine International,"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI5L2FpcmJ1cy1zb2xhci1haXJwbGFuZS1jcmFzaGVzLWFmdGVyLTY0LWRheXMtb2YtZmx5aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From pv magazine France

After 64 days of continuous flight, a solar-powered drone-satellite developed by Airbus Defense and Space crashed in the desert in the US state of Arizona on Aug. 18. The incident did not cause any injuries.

“The prototype aircraft's flight ended when the Zephyr 8 UAS encountered events that led to its unexpected shutdown,” said the US Army Command in a statement.

The drone was launched from the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) test site in Arizona on June 15. The unmanned aircraft soared more than 60,000 feet (about 18 km) over the southern United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America, before returning to its starting point. Prior to the crash, air traffic control data showed the drone flying at an unusually low altitude.

“The military and its partners have collected invaluable data and increased knowledge about the endurance, battery efficiency, and station-keeping capabilities of the aircraft at high altitudes,” said said Michael Monteleone, director of the military program overseeing the flight. “This knowledge will allow us to continue to advance the requirements for reliable and modernized stratospheric capabilities for our soldiers.”

The drone, which is remotely controlled by satellite, weighs 75 kg. It has a wingspan of 25 meters and is entirely covered with PV modules with multi-junction cells. The system enabled the aircraft to travel more than 55,000 km, or more than one trip around the Earth.

The Zephyr 8 drone managed to double the previous endurance record for an unmanned aircraft, which was just under 26 days. Within a few hours, it would have been able to break the record for the longest flight in history, held by two American airmen, at 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and five seconds in the sky.

Unmanned aircraft are drawing interest from the military and telecoms sectors. They can be used for high-resolution observation, surveillance, and high-speed communication services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999224066734314}",neutral,0.999224066734314,0
Solar-powered Airbus endurance UAV meets its end after 64 days of nonstop flight - Flightglobal,"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5LXVhdnMvc29sYXItcG93ZXJlZC1haXJidXMtZW5kdXJhbmNlLXVhdi1tZWV0cy1pdHMtZW5kLWFmdGVyLTY0LWRheXMtb2Ytbm9uc3RvcC1mbGlnaHQvMTQ5OTM1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Zephyr, a solar-powered, long-endurance unmanned air vehicle (UAV) developed by Airbus Defence & Space and the US Army, came down unexpectedly on 19 August after 64 days of continuous stratospheric flight.

Airbus confirms that the aircraft’s flight ended, saying it still completed numerous mission objectives. Few details are known, but flight data suggests a rapid descent.

“The teams are currently analysing the stratospheric flight that this mission provided. The valuable experience from this flight is part of the process of reaching our ultimate flight-endurance goals,” Airbus says.

Zephyr had been airborne since taking off on 15 June, according to Army Futures Command (AFC), which managed Zephy’s in-flight activities. The office did not respond to a FlightGlobal request for comment.

Known as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS), the Airbus platform had recently being flying over the Yuma Proving Ground military test site in Arizona. The army is seeking to develop what it describes as an “ultra-long-endurance stratospheric [unmanned air system] capabilities”.

Airbus sees many military and commercial applications for Zephyr, including for performing persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, convoy protection, signal interception, crop monitoring and wildfire management.

The AFC notes that Zephyr achieved a number of firsts before its untimely return to Earth. It completed the “longest continuous flight utilising satellite communication controls, and the farthest demonstration from its launch point, while carrying a commercial, off-the-shelf payload”.

The ultralight aircraft’s wings spanned 25m (82ft) and held an array of solar panels, used to power Zephyr’s two wing-mounted propellers. The aircraft weighed less than 75kg (165lb), according to Airbus.

Zephyr’s systems stored enough solar power during daytime to power the aircraft at night.

Flight data then shows a sudden descent, with Zephyr losing altitude at a rate as high as 4,544ft per minute.

Neither Airbus nor the AFC have confirmed that a crash occurred. Airbus says only that the aircraft “experienced circumstances that ended its current flight”.

Zephyr narrowly missed breaking the long-standing record for endurance flight, which was also set in the American Southwest. In 1958, two pilots of a Cessna 172 spent just under 65 days flying continuously near Las Vegas, Nevada, refuelling via a hose connected to a moving truck on the ground.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99989914894104}",neutral,0.99989914894104,0
Malaysia Airlines Inks Tentative Agreement For 20 Airbus A330neo Aircraft - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS1haXJsaW5lcy1pbmtzLXRlbnRhdGl2ZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtMTE1ODQ2NTQzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a transaction that also involves the aircraft leasing firm Avolon, Malaysia Airlines has inked a tentative agreement to buy 20 Airbus SE (OTC: EADSY) A330neos to replace its A330ceo fleet.

The carrier will purchase 10 of the aircraft from Airbus and then enter into a sale-and-leaseback agreement with Avolon, leasing the remaining 10 aircraft directly from the latter.

The planes are scheduled to be delivered from 3Q24 through 2028.

""The acquisition of the A330neos is a natural transition from our current A330ceos fleet, but the A330neo will not only provide modernisation to our fleet and enhanced operational efficiency, but also meet environmental targets through reduced fuel-burn per seat while keeping passenger safety and comfort at its core,"" said Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Izham Ismail.

In addition, the airline stated it was collaborating more broadly with Airbus in Malaysia in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, training, maintenance, and airspace management.

Price Action: EADSY shares closed higher by 0.90% at $27.94 on Friday.
