JetBlue receives A321 from Airbus team in Mobile, Alabama

U.S.-based JetBlue received the first aircraft – an A321 – to be delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama

The first ever delivery of an aircraft from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility took place today, April 25th, in Mobile, Alabama. The entire team of employees from the American assembly line gathered to present their very first completed product, an Airbus A321, to JetBlue. On hand for the occasion were executives from Airbus, JetBlue senior management, including President and CEO Robin Hayes, and a broad collection of dignitaries from the Gulf Coast region.“I am immensely proud to be here to participate in this first delivery from Mobile,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “Going from breaking ground on this facility three years ago to handing over the first Alabama-produced A321 today is an amazing accomplishment. It’s a testament to how well executed this project was and how strong the teamwork has been here in Mobile and throughout Airbus. The Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility has brought together all the best aspects of our other assembly lines around the world, and it shows how Airbus people work hand in hand with our partners to deliver great aircraft to our customers.”Airbus announced its commitment to build a single-aisle assembly line in Mobile, Alabama in 2012, and less than one year later, broke ground on the $600 million (U.S.) facility. The ceremonial inauguration of the plant came in September 2015. The aircraft delivered today, a JetBlue A321, successfully had its first flight on March 21st, 2016.In addition to the JetBlue A321 delivered today, there are currently nine other A320 Family aircraft in production at the facility. Airbus anticipates delivering four aircraft per month from the Mobile plant by the end of 2017. The initial deliveries will all be A320 Family aircraft with the Current Engine Option (CEO), but will begin transitioning to New Engine Option (NEO) derivatives in late 2017.In addition to hundreds of new Airbus jobs the project has brought to the local community, the Mobile area has seen many Airbus suppliers open new facilities in the region, providing even more employment and a parallel boost to the local economy. Airbus is proud to boast that 87 percent of its new employees are from the Gulf Coast region, with nearly one third being U.S. military veterans.Demonstrating the adage “The Sun Never Sets on Airbus” – Airbus aircraft are now produced around the clock, 24 hours a day, at facilities in: Mobile, Alabama; Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; and Tianjin, China."
Airbus Is Opening a New Pilot School in Singapore - Fortune,"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC8xOC9haXJidXMtYXNpYS1waWxvdC1zaG9ydGFnZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The shortage of airline pilots is a persistent problem. In the U.S., it’s been exacerbated by an increase in the flying hours required for licenses and miserably low pay.

In Asia, a boom in the travel market is what’s spiking pilot demand. Economic growth in the region has prompted the emergence of new airlines that want to serve the continent’s ballooning middle class.

Indeed, Boeing (BA) and Airbus have both predicted that Asia will become the world’s largest travel market in two decades. Airbus says Asia’s in-service fleet will grow from around 5,600 aircraft today to 14,000 over the next 20 years. As a result, the active flight crew population will skyrocket from over 65,000 to almost 170,000, and Airbus on Monday said it has an answer to that increased demand.

The airplane maker is opening a new flight crew training school in Singapore through a joint venture with Singapore Airlines. It will be the fourth and largest Airbus facility, joining centers that are already in operation in Miami, Beijing, and Toulouse, France. The school will have eight full-flight simulators and six fixed cockpit training devices, giving it the capacity to offer courses to more than 10,000 trainees per year.

Airbus’ new center is intended to provide training and advice specific to its aircrafts; the school is for pilots who are already employed by airlines, not for student pilots. The company says 17 airlines from Asia and the Pacific have already signed up to use the services of the facility."

Airbus A380 order canceled - Business Insider,"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtb3JkZXItY2FuY2VsbGVkLWFpci1hdXN0cmFsLTIwMTYtNNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtb3JkZXItY2FuY2VsbGVkLWFpci1hdXN0cmFsLTIwMTYtND9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380.

Air Austral has axed its order for two Airbus A380 superjumbos.

Airbus confirmed the cancellation of the deal that had a market value of more than $865 million — although it's likely that Air Austral negotiated significant discounts.

""The agreement has been reached between Air Austral and Airbus following a change of strategy decided by the airline,"" the European airplane maker told Business Insider. ""We continue to work closely with our customer for future requirements.""

Had Air Austral taken delivery of its double-deckers, it would have seen the airline outfit the planes with 840 seats each in an all-economy configuration.

That's right: 840 seats!

That's more than double the 400 or so seats found on A380s operated by Korean Air and Singapore Airlines. But most superjumbos fly with between 480 and 560 seats featuring economy, business, and first-class suites.

Sure, flying on the A380 is generally regarded as a pleasant experience, but being crammed into a plane with 839 other people seems less than ideal for most fliers.

In that regard, count this as a win for passengers.

Air Austral's 840-seater would have beaten the current passenger-volume champion from Emirates, which manages to cram in 615 passengers in business and economy classes. With that said, the majority of Emirates' A380s feature three classes and carry about 500 passengers.

Air Austral planned to operated the all-economy A380 on its route from the airline's home base on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion to Paris. The airline flies that route using a fleet of Boeing 777-300ERs with 442 seats in a three-class configuration.

Even with the cancellation of the Air Austral order, the Airbus A380 has, so far, had a solid year. The superjumbo has earned orders from All Nippon Airways and Iran Air.

Airbus has taken 319 total orders for the A380, with 184 in operation around the world. The superjumbo's largest customer is Dubai-based Emirates, with 140 A380s ordered and a fleet of 75 in operation."

Airbus Group is making huge strides in the expansion of its research capacities at the Group's site in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen to the south of Munich. On Thursday, the Group inaugurated its new material research laboratory and celebrated a ground-breaking ceremony for the E-Aircraft System House. Guests included leadership and experts from government, industry and the scientific community. Airbus Group also sealed a partnership with Siemens in the field of electric flight. In addition, the on-site Ludwig Bolköw Campus signed an agreement to establish a new 3D printing centre, dubbed the ‘Aerospace Factory.’

Tom Enders, Airbus Group CEO, and Siemens CEO, Joe Kaeser, signed the agreement in the presence of Ilse Aigner, Deputy Minister President of Bavaria, and Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Economics, Brigitte Zypries. The Project partners plan to jointly develop electric and hybrid aircraft propulsion systems.

About The Airbus Group

Airbus Group is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2015, the Group – comprising Airbus, Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters – generated revenues of € 64.5 billion and employed a workforce of around 136,600.

Government leadership also attended the formal opening of the material research laboratory and raised a hammer for the symbolic groundbreaking for the E-Aircraft System House.

With the E-Aircraft System House, Airbus Group plans to develop technologies for electric and hybrid aircraft propulsion. The Group's internal research and development facility will be jointly operated by Airbus Group and its three Divisions. Construction work is expected to start in early 2017; the opening is scheduled for end 2018. The use of electric and hybrid aircraft engines significantly reduces both CO2 emissions and noise levels in flight and enables new and efficient aircraft concepts. For several years now, Airbus Group has been exploring the technologies necessary to realise hybrid electric aircraft.

The newly opened materials research laboratory belongs to Airbus Group Innovations, the Group’s central global research network. Lab researchers will focus on developing materials for aircraft construction which are lightweight, robust and environmentally friendly. At around 4,500 square metres, the lab will house a team of 65 experts who will explore a diverse range of technologies ranging from 3D printing and surface technology to innovative welding methods.

The Aerospace Factory, envisioned as a centre for 3D printing, will research innovative production methods for the aerospace industry and develop them to maturity. Additive Layer Manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, can be used to manufacture components with highly complex geometries that are built up layer by layer from metallic powder heated with a laser. Time-consuming processing steps can be omitted from the traditional manufacturing process. Component shapes and designs can be calculated so that the printed parts are both light and extremely stable. The Aerospace Factory will be based on the Ludwig Bölkow Campus, an interdisciplinary venture between industry and universities at the Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen site. The signatories of the declaration of intent are made up of aerospace company Airbus Safran Launchers; engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines; EOS GmbH, the world’s leading company for technology and quality in the field of high-end AM solutions and a pioneer in the field of direct metal laser sintering; Airbus Group Innovations; the Technical University of Munich with its Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb); the Fraunhofer Development Center for X-ray Technology (EZRT), a division of the Fraunhofer IIS; Airbus subsidiary APWorks; Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG); the Airbus Endowed Chair for Integrative Simulation and Engineering of Materials and Processes (ISEMP) of the University of Bremen; and the ESI Group, a pioneer and the world’s leading provider of virtual prototyping solutions.

At the end of 2015, the Ludwig Bölkow Campus and the TU Munich opened the world’s first-ever technical centre for growing algae for the production of environmentally friendly kerosene at the Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen site.

Qatar Airways Airbus A350 Long-Haul Review: Inaugural Service to Boston - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWxvbmctaGF1bC1yZXZpZXctaW5hdWd1cmFsLXNlcnZpY2UtYm9zdG9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways has been growing rapidly, both in terms of their fleet and their route network. I recently got to experience an example of both when I joined Qatar for their inaugural flight to Boston Logan Airport (BOS), utilizing the new Airbus A350-900 XWB. It was a pretty special trip.

After a rather disappointing first experience on Qatar when flying in from Los Angeles, I was really hoping to see Qatar’s best when departing from their home hub of Doha. Sometimes, operating from outstations with once-daily service can be very challenging.

This would be my first time flying the Airbus A350 as well – just a few days before our Editor-in-Chief David Parker Brown. I wanted to make sure to take the chance to remind him of that (thanks Blaine ^David).

Overall, my flight was great. The service was up to snuff and the food tasty. But the star of the show was the A350. Wow, what a ride. Read on!

Qatar Airways has been expanding quite a bit over the last few years into new US markets. The new service to Boston, New England’s economic hub, comes on the heels of new service to Los Angeles, and an upcoming new route into Atlanta. New York has also been upgraded to twice-daily flights. Just like the other members of the “ME3” (Emirates and Etihad), Qatar Airways has found geography on its side, making for one-stop connections around the world, particularly to places like India.

All of that growth requires a fleet to support it. Qatar has invested heavily in the Boeing 787 and also the Airbus A350, of which they were the inaugural customer. While I’ve flown the Dreamliner a number of times, I had yet to try the A350.

BONUS: Hitching a Ride on a Qatar Airways Boeing 787-8 Delivery Flight

We arrived at Doha’s beautiful Hamad International Airport. It mirrored the rest of the modern city of Doha that I saw. It was constructed recently just next to the old international airport, and is something that Qatar Airways should be proud to call home. Unfortunately, there were some miscommunications within my travel group, and we were unable to visit the (from what I’ve heard, excellent) Al Mourjan Business Lounge. That’s ok, though, as it gave me more time to drool over the amazing A350 sitting at our gate.

It’s important to remember that the A350-900 is much larger than the smallest version of the 787 family. I had to keep reminding myself that this isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison. While the 787 roughly competes (in size, not range) with the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330, the A350-900 fights in a different weight class – it is almost exactly the same size as the Boeing 777-200.

Boarding was chaotic. There was no special mention of the inaugural Boston flight or any kind of gate celebration, but they did give away items to commemorate the flight. Each passenger got a special certificate for the occasion, along with a Qatar Airways polo shirt and a Qatar-branded battery power pack (while a nice touch, I’m not sure if adding 300+ cheap lithium ion batteries to a flight is such a solid idea). While business class was trying to board, I saw grandmas with their elbows out and heads down, pushing as hard as they could to the front of the line. Alright, alright, but we’re all going the same place, right?

Once in my seat, my excitement really ramped up. Wow, was this plane gorgeous or what? I had a great view out of my window of the massive-looking Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, as well as the artful curled-up winglet that sported Qatar’s Oryx logo. The business class cabin feels extremely airy, as they have foregone the center overhead bins in favor of a wide, flat ceiling. Between the front business cabin and rear section (where I sat) was a wide-open space, with a small bar but no visual obstructions. Combined with artful LED mood lighting and that “new plane smell”, this felt like plane heaven.

%CODE1%

The plane also had optional in-window electric mini blinds, at least in business class, that offered an opaque shade to allow some natural light, but also a blackout shade for sleeping time. While I loved the look and function of it (but can’t imagine the poor mechanic that has to fix it), I actually prefer the Boeing 787’s electrochromic dimming system. I prefer that system’s ability to let me look out the window without brightening the entire cabin. To each their own, however.

We pushed from our gate right on time with a mostly full flight. A handful of folks, like myself, were on board to celebrate the inaugural – you could spot them as the ones walking around with cameras and big grins on their faces. Other folks were just regular passengers, unaware that they were on any type of special flight. The passenger in front of me was a two-million-mile American Airlines elite, and for him this was just another flight.

%CODE2%

I got immense joy from watching the A350’s tail camera on my in-flight entertainment display. This is the first plane I’ve been on with it, and the skies had cleared from the earlier rain, allowing for a great view. Watching the takeoff roll was impressive!

Once we were in flight, the service kicked in to high gear. We were offered our choice of a hot or cold towel, and the crew set up the modest mid-cabin business class bar, which offered champagne and some fresh fruit. While it looked nice, I didn’t actually see anyone use it during the flight.

I changed in to my provided pajamas, and then decided to order some food. Given that we didn’t visit the lounge as I had expected, I was pretty hungry. Just like on my inbound flight from Los Angeles, the menu is a la carte – you can order whatever food you’d like at any time during the flight. I started with something from the “Lighter Options” menu, a very tasty Thai marinated beef and glass noodle salad, served cold. I moved on to the roasted tomato soup with basil; it was good, but nowhere near as good a the roasted corn soup on my flight to Doha.

Adhering to the “when in Rome” mentality, I then had the Arabic mezze. When I was growing up, an Armenian friend’s mom would send tabbouleh with his lunch, which I remember fondly. This definitely wasn’t as good as that, but the platter was tasty.

For my main course, I selected the seared red snapper with saffron cream sauce and asparagus. It was a great dish, and the fish was cooked perfectly (it always amazes me when a carrier can manage that on an airplane!) Throughout my meal, I tried a number of wines from the extensive list. It was a great meal.

After stuffing myself, I decided to get some sleep. I wasn’t really tired, but knew I had a long day ahead of me; we would arrive to Boston at around 3:00 PM local time, and then I had a four-hour layover and a four-hour (economy) flight back to Denver. Sleep was going to be important. I made up my bed with the provided duvet, and managed to get about five hours of sound sleep – the smooth and quiet A350 had a lot to do with that.

The in-flight entertainment (IFE) system had an extensive selection of movies and shows. I watched The Martian for the what has to have been the fifth time, and then enjoyed a few episodes of Mythbusters – I’m really going to miss that show. Unlike Qatar’s Boeing 777 fleet, the new A350 features satellite-based WiFi service, so I was able to keep up with work while flying. That can both be a good and bad thing.

Soon, we were getting close to Boston. I guess after my 16-hour flight from Los Angeles, the relatively-short 12-hour flight had flown by (pun intended). It was a beautiful day, so once again the tail camera on the IFE system was put to good use. This was my first inaugural, so I was hoping we’d have a warm welcome waiting for us on the ground.

I wasn’t disappointed. As we landed, I could see a few airport fire trucks lined up on the taxiway, waiting to greet us with a water cannon salute. That was a pretty cool experience, and those non-AvGeeks seemed to finally realize there was something special about this flight. As we taxied up to the gate, there were tons of folks standing all around the apron, phones and cameras lifted high in the air. While I’m sure they were excited to welcome new service to Doha on Qatar Airways, I honestly think most of them were there to see the beautiful Airbus A350. It was fun to wave back at the excited crowds from my big windows.

Qatar Airways’ expansion to Boston makes a lot of sense. Boston is a hub for Qatar partner JetBlue, which can provide a domestic feed for Qatar. Emirates already serves the city, so Qatar is able to offer some competition on flights to the Middle East. Boston is a world-class, diverse city, and should be able to support both business and leisure traffic. The economical Airbus A350 helps make the business case better as well.

While the A350 is still a rare sight in North America, I hope it becomes more common as production ramps up. Trust me – you’re going to like flying it.

Note: I was a guest of Qatar Airways for this flight review. All opinions are my own, however.

Emirates already flies 75 A380s with another 65 on order. The double-decker A380 is the world’s largest passenger aircraft. Emirates' models have layouts ranging from 489 seats to 615. Emirates also is the world’s largest operator of Boeing’s popular Boeing 777 widebody.

Those two planes have helped fuel a rapid global expansion for Emirates, now one of the biggest airlines on the planet. Today, Emirates flies more international passengers than any other carrier.

As for its two new A380s, they’re set to be delivered to the carrier in the fourth quarter of 2017, The Associated Press reports. The planes would be worth $865 million at list prices, though big airlines typically receive significant discounts on such orders.

An inside look at the Emirates A380 Emirates showed off its swanky first-class seats at Washington Dulles. Here's an all-access inside look at the plane.

Emirates has been Airbus’ top customer for the A380 by a wide margin, accounting for 45% of all orders for the jet, according to The Wall Street Journal.

A number of other airlines bought A380s in smaller numbers when the jet first came on the market. Other customers now flying the jet include Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Air France and British Airways, among others.

But orders have been few since the early days of the A380. The Journal notes “airlines have shied away from the large plane, concerned they can’t find a financially viable way to fill the aircraft, which seats more than 500 passengers.”

And several carriers have backed out of prior commitments for the jet, including Skymark Airlines.

Reuters writes “Airbus, which had been left holding onto the two mammoth planes after clashing with failed Japanese carrier Skymark Airlines over unpaid debts, announced the sale of two planes to an undisclosed customer earlier this week.” Emirates acknowledged Wednesday that it was the buyer.

Reuters adds “the sale resolves the problem of what to do with two aircraft that have been sitting outside its plant in blue tails and green primer paint for months, diverting cash.” The planes now must be reconfigured for Emirates, which plans to fly them in its “high-density” two-class layout.

“We’ve always been open about how the A380 has been a big success for Emirates. It’s a boon for our operations to slot constrained airports and we get a lot of positive feedback from our customers,"" Emirates president Tim Clark says in a statement to The National of Dubai.

Airspace by Airbus at Aircraft Interiors Expo - APEX Media,"Tue, 05 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcnNwYWNlLWFpcmJ1cy1haXJjcmFmdC1pbnRlcmlvcnMtZXhwby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft Interiors Airspace by Airbus at Aircraft Interiors Expo Share

APEX Insight: After recently announcing its new “Airspace by Airbus” design philosophy in London, Airbus displayed a mock-up of an “Airspace” A330neo cabin at Aircraft Interiors Expo. The mock-up featured the core elements of the design concept, all bathed in the mauve glow of programmable LED lighting.

Airbus has come a long way in cabin design since it placed folding chairs inside a painted outline that represented its first A300 aircraft on the ramp in Toulouse, more than 40 years ago. “But already here, we had 18 inch as the standard comfort seating for economy,” says Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus’ vice president, Cabin Marketing. “When you look at cabins today, they look a lot different.”

At the Aircraft Interiors Expo today, Airbus presented the cabin mock-up of the new re-engined wide-body A330neo, showcasing its new Airspace by Airbus interior design concept, which was launched two weeks ago in London. Wuggetzer says, “We started the brand because we wanted to underline comfort and innovation leadership, and provide a tool for airlines to promote our Airbus cabin advantages to their passengers.”

The A330neo cabin mock-up featured Airspace design options that include reconfigured overhead bins and lavatories with touchless fixtures and anti-bacterial surfaces. Examples of business-class, premium economy, and economy-class seating were installed in the mock-up, along with programmable LED lighting. “We want to ensure, when you first enter the aircraft, that we create love at first sight. A moment that you will never forget and can’t wait to repeat,” says Wuggetzer.

Features and technology introduced on Airbus’ A350 XWB will migrate to the rest of the company’s product line, including the A330neo, A380 and A320 series. And Airbus’ A350 XWB’s cabin interior recently won the 2016 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award for Product Design.

Airbus also announced a contract to upgrade the business-class cabins of Malaysia Airlines’ A330 fleet, that Delta Air Lines recently took delivery of the first A321 equipped with new pivoting overhead bins, and the Space-Flex v2 rear cabin configuration.

Tomorrow, Airbus will announce the first operator of an A330neo equipped with an Airspace by Airbus interior."

ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines said Friday that it will buy 37 more Airbus A321 aircraft, the carrier’s second major aircraft order in as many days.

Delta says the A321 order is part of an ongoing effort to “renew its narrowbody fleet.” The 37 aircraft in the order will be delivered concurrently with Delta’s existing A321 orders, which will give the airline 82 A321s by the end of the decade. Delta already has 126 other aircraft from Airbus’ A320 family of jets in its fleet.

Delta’s first A321 arrived to the carrier in March, and is scheduled to begin regular passenger service May 2 on a flight from Atlanta to Orlando.

“The Airbus A320 family of aircraft continues to be a cost-efficient, reliable and customer-pleasing mainstay of our narrowbody fleet,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s incoming CEO, says in a statement. “The order for the A321s is an opportunistic fleet move that enables us to produce strong returns and cost-effectively accelerate the retirement of Delta’s 116 MD-88s in a capital efficient manner.”

Delta noted its latest order for 37 current-generation A321s comes ""near the end of the model’s production cycle,’ indicating it negotiated a significant discount for the planes.”

The A321 order comes just 24 hours after Delta said it would purchase at least 75 of Bombardier’s new C Series jets. Delta will be the U.S. launch customer for that new line of aircraft from Bombardier. The first of those CS100s are expected to begin flying Delta passengers in 2018.

Pilot training at Airbus Helicopters Training Centre Manching to start in May

Donauwörth, With today´s successful technical acceptance, Airbus Helicopters has handed over the first two of five lightweight military multi-role H145M helicopters to the Royal Thai Navy. This marks an important milestone in the H145M programme on its way to the final acceptance and entry into service in Thailand at the end of 2016. A delegation from the Royal Thai Navy and Airbus Helicopters Germany CEO Wolfgang Schoder participated in the ceremony at Airbus Helicopters´ Donauwörth site.“After the H145M made its market entry with the German Air Force at the end of last year, we are very proud that the Royal Thai Navy has become another operator of the new H145M”, said Wolfgang Schoder. “The helicopter is the most advanced solution for the increasingly challenging demands of our military customers in modern-day missions. It combines state-of-the-art technologies, outstanding performance and true multi-role capabilities while maintaining very high versatility and low operating costs.”The H145M is the military version of the civil H145 that entered service in mid-2014 and has recently reached the milestone of 15,000 flying hours in customer operations. With a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tons, the H145M can be used for a wide range of military operations including naval, utility, reconnaissance, search and rescue, medical evacuation and armed scout. The Royal Thai Navy H145M is equipped with Multi-Purpose Pylons incl. aerodynamic fairings, cargo hooks, hoists, HF system for SAR operations, weather radar, internal long range fuel tank system and fixed provisions for future special operations upgrade.These two H145M helicopters will stay in Germany for pilot training at Airbus Helicopters’ Training Academy. All helicopters are scheduled for delivery in Thailand by September 2016.Designed as a true military multi-role helicopter, the H145M offers a single platform, which is able to perform day and night missions in harsh weather conditions and difficult terrain. Its large mission equipment range, depending on the customer configuration, increases mission flexibility for military operators. The helicopter’s Helionix® digital avionics suite – incorporating the in-house developed 4-axis autopilot – is designed to reduce crew workload while providing high levels of safety and improved situational awareness. The H145M is powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 2E equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC). Its low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.The H145 helicopter family has proven its value for military customers for many years. For instance, the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), the launch customer for the H145M, has ordered 15 of these helicopters in a Special Forces configuration. The third helicopter will be delivered in the coming days.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries. Airbus Helicopters employs more than 22,000 people worldwide and in 2015 generated revenues of 6.8 billion Euros."
Florida factory to mass-produce satellites at record pace – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTYvMDQvMTkvZmxvcmlkYS1mYWN0b3J5LXRvLW1hc3MtcHJvZHVjZS1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWF0LXJlY29yZC1wYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OneWeb officials Tuesday unveiled plans for a factory just outside the gates of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida that will churn out up to 15 satellites per week to populate low Earth orbit and beam broadband Internet signals worldwide.

Repurposing aircraft assembly line methods to satellite manufacturing, OneWeb and Airbus Defense and Space are partnering to produce 900 refrigerator-sized spacecraft for launches beginning in 2018.

The first 10 satellites will be assembled at Airbus’s existing satellite factory in Toulouse, France, with series production of 890 more Airbus-designed platforms to follow at a new $85 million facility to be built at Exploration Park near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, officials said Tuesday.

The Florida factory is due to open by the end of 2017.

Each OneWeb spacecraft will weigh about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) and use electrical propulsion to enter formation in 20 orbital planes 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) above Earth to broadcast high-speed Internet connectivity to customers across the globe.

The network will provide more than 10 terabits per second of new capacity to underserved areas around the world and extend the reach of mobile phone networks and Internet service providers.

Founded by Greg Wyler, a satellite and telecom entrepreneur, OneWeb plans to launch 648 satellites in the first phase of the constellation. The rest of the spacecraft will be spares pre-positioned in orbit or on the ground.

“This new facility is another step in the dream of enabling affordable Internet access for the entire globe,” Wyler said in a statement. “These satellites are truly state of the art as we have really pushed, but not exceeded, the limits of technology. With this new facility we will be able to iterate, update and continuously improve the satellites design and performance, and being right at the space center using Virgin Galactic we will be able to launch new satellites within hours of completion.”

The bulk of the initial constellation — totaling up to 700 satellites — will be launched by Russian Soyuz rockets under a contract signed last year between OneWeb and Arianespace.

OneWeb ordered 21 Soyuz launches from up to four spaceports — the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Vostochny and Plesetsk in Russia, and the European-run Guiana Space Center in South America — to send up between 32 and 36 satellites at a time.

Arianespace also secured optional orders from OneWeb for five more Soyuz launches and three flights of the next-generation Ariane 6 rocket.

Virgin Galactic’s air-launched LauncherOne vehicle, which is still in development and could fly by the end of 2017, was also awarded 39 launches by OneWeb to replenish the company’s satellite fleet as old satellites stop working. LauncherOne will haul up one satellite at a time after dropping from a modified Boeing 747 carrier jet.

Virgin Galactic’s satellite launches could be based at multiple locations. Initial test launches could take off from Mojave, California, and operational flights could stage from Spaceport America in New Mexico and the former shuttle landing trip at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

OneWeb selected Florida’s Space Coast for the satellite factory after surveying other contending locales across North America.

“As we traveled around and looked at other states, and in some cases other countries, of where to put this, we could never recreate the pioneering spirit that you feel here on this site so close to Kennedy (Space Center), and we hope to tap that and bring that into our business,” said Brian Holz, CEO of OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture between OneWeb and Airbus that will manage spacecraft production. “We’re attempting to really revolutionize and transform how satellites are going to be built, and that pioneering spirit is going to be key to our employees. Hiring from the history here, and the experience that’s here, is going to be real important in helping us achieve that.”

Space Florida, a state agency charged with luring commercial aerospace business to the Sunshine State, helped arrange $20 million in government incentives to bring the OneWeb factory to the Space Coast.

“This is not only an advanced manufacturing facility for the company, but there are plans clearly to support a number of major sub-tier suppliers in this facility, and we look forward to welcoming them as well,” said Frank DiBello, president and CEO of Space Florida.

The OneWeb installation will be located next to a rocket manufacturing plant being developed by Blue Origin, and is a few miles from cavernous NASA-owned hangars used for final assembly of the Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule for deep space expeditions, Boeing’s commercial CST-100 Starliner astronaut transport, and Sierra Nevada’s Dream Chaser space plane for cargo runs to the International Space Station.

The U.S. Air Force’s reusable X-37B space plane is also refurbished between missions at Kennedy Space Center.

The storied Florida spaceport was the departure point for the Apollo missions to the moon and all space shuttle flights, but it was never a center for spacecraft and rocket manufacturing until recent years.

“We have the location, the facilities and the talented workforce to make space operations successful,” said Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle commander and director of Kennedy Space Center. “We truly are America’s premier spaceport, and it’s a real pleasure for me to welcome OneWeb to the team.”

OneWeb says it will hire 250 engineers for the 100,000-square-foot (9,000-square-meter) Florida satellite plant.

“Satellites today are really manufactured in an artisan way,” said Holz, a satellite industry veteran with previous stints at Orbital Sciences, Ball Aerospace and O3b. “It’s very labor-intensive, very hands-on, and it takes a long time. A typical satellite of the complexity built for Intelsat will take four to five months to integrate, and we’re going to build one in an eight-hour shift. That’s pretty amazing.

“You will see state of the art automation in this factory,” Holz said. “We’re going to be using robotics to move the satellites around the assembly floor — the different pieces — (and) bring them together where they’ll be assembled. We’ll have robotics to attach parts of the equipment on the satellites. All of this is to take the human error out of the process. We will have humans using specialized tools to mount the hardware on the equipment, and those specialized tools will send data into a data acquisition center that we can use to improve the process.”

Holz said OneWeb will borrow mass-production techniques from aircraft assembly processes mastered by Airbus.

“There will be a lot of new elements brought into satellite manufacturing that only this facility will have in the world, and that will allow us to be very cost-effective, so we can help Greg and OneWeb achieve their dream of pushing affordable Internet access into the developing world and connecting schools.”

OneWeb and Airbus hope to sell similar small, relatively-inexpensive satellites to other customers after demonstrating the production capabilities in Florida.

“In June 2015, we started from scratch to create a new satellite design and manufacturing company,” said François Auque, head of space systems at Airbus. “In both Florida and Europe, we are now embarking on the next stage of an unprecedented venture in the space industry: a site that can mass-produce dozens of satellites every month. All this, of course, without affecting the levels of quality and technology that are essential when it comes to spacecraft – complex machines that need to operate for several years in space.”

Based in Britain’s Channel Islands, OneWeb counts Richard Branson’s Virgin Group as one of its chief financial backers. Other investors include Intelsat, one of the world’s largest conventional telecom satellite operators.

David McGlade, Intelsat’s executive chairman, attended the announcement Tuesday in Florida. He said Intelsat hopes to augment its own satellite coverage with OneWeb to serve clients like the U.S. government in hard-to-reach parts of the world, such as polar regions not visible to conventional geostationary satellites over the equator.

Intelsat will operate the satellite fleet in orbit for OneWeb.

Airbus, Qualcomm, New Delhi-based Bharti Enterprises, Hughes Network Systems — a subsidiary of EchoStar Corp. — Coca-Cola and Totalplay, a company owned by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, are also behind OneWeb.

OneWeb is Wyler’s second major venture after he established O3b Networks, which operates a fleet of 12 satellites to supply low-latency broadband Internet services to remote equatorial customers, such as islands in the Pacific Ocean, sub-Saharan Africa and luxury cruise liners.

Google, HSBC and satellite operator SES, a rival of Intelsat, were the big investors in O3b.

OneWeb aims to beam wifi and mobile data service around the world by 2019, reaching homes, businesses, hospitals, schools, oil rigs, ships, airplanes and trains. It works by broadcasting a signal to a hotspot that customers can install on their roofs.

"As Airbus delivers 'BluesMobile' to JetBlue, high spirits fly (and so do a few jabs at Boeing) - al.com - AL.com","Mon, 25 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDE2LzA0L2FzX2FpcmJ1c19kZWxpdmVyc19ibHVlc21vYmlsZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two things guaranteed to play well in Mobile are football metaphors and jokes at Boeing's expense, and Airbus officials made sure to hit both as they delivered their first U.S.-built jetliner to its owner, JetBlue.

The occasion was jovial and celebratory, starting with a fanfare from the University of South Alabama marching band and some cheers from the USA pep squad: ""Go Airbus!"" ""We are ... Airbus!"" ""Here we go, JetBlue, here we go!""

Airbus Group Chairman and CEO Allan McArtor said the day was all about teamwork. ""Here in the state of Alabama, more so than anywhere, team successes are best symbolized by the traditions associated with college football,"" he said. ""We all know you can't have a great day of teamwork like that without a marching band and cheerleaders.""

A few moments later, John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer -- customers, took the podium before an audience of dignitaries and media packed shoulder-to-shoulder in rows of folding chairs. ""You're sitting in the Boeing seats right now,"" Leahy said, to laughter and applause. ""The airbus seat on JetBlue is substantially wider.""

The gag is a legacy of a hard-fought competition several years back over a contract to build Air Force tankers; Boeing's eventual win was a setback to Airbus plans to open a factory in Mobile, and Boeing supporters had some less-than-kind things to say about Alabama.

Leahy went on to speak more seriously about Airbus' history in the United States. He joined the company in 1985, he said, when Airbus was struggling to sell its planes to American carriers. The answer to that challenge, he said, was to build a better plane. As for the wild notion that Airbus might someday actually build those planes in the United States, he said, ""Most of us thought it was just a dream we'd never see in our lifetime.""

Leahy talked a bit about Airbus' growth over the years - the company now spends $16 billion a year with American suppliers, he said, a number projected to grow to $20 billion in a few years. He described a longtime relationship with JetBlue. And he sang the praises of Alabama's port city.

""There is no better place in the United States to build airplanes than Mobile, Alabama,"" he said, a remark that drew wide applause and prompted some members of the crowd to come to their feet - notably Mobile City Council members Fred Richardson, Gina Gregory, Bess Rich and Joel Daves. ""We are very proud of Mobile, Alabama,"" Leahy continued. ""This is our hometown, our American hometown.""

As the USA band played the introduction to ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra,"" the local Airbus workforce filed out of a nearby production building and escorted the brand-new Airbus 321A as it was pulled across the tarmac in a move symbolizing its delivery.

""What you see here is not just an aircraft, it's a symbol,"" said Daryl Taylor, general manager of Airbus's U.S. manufacturing facility at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. ""It's a symbol of what can happen when a team works together to create something special.""

Taylor also was the first to draw notice to the name painted near the cockpit of the jet: ""BluesMobile.""

""With that name, there'll be no mistake where this aircraft came from,"" he said.

It was point JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes was glad to echo. ""We couldn't be happier,"" about the name, he said, because it'll serve as a reminder not only of where the plane came from, but the special partnership between Airbus and JetBlue.

(Neither man referred to the plane as ""The Bluesmobile,"" which might have been a less auspicious moniker, given that it's the name of a surplus police cruiser that leads one of the great cinematic car chases of all time, in ""The Blues Brothers,"" and then spontaneously disintegrates after giving its all. Asked about the distinction between ""The Bluesmobile"" and ""BluesMobile,"" Taylor said, ""JetBlue picked the name. We like what they picked."")

Hayes said that in the late '90s, when JetBlue was just getting started, Airbus took the fledgling company seriously enough to accept orders for planes. ""Airbus were there for us in the early days, and have been great partners ever since,"" he said.

Hayes commented that BluesMobile would soon be in service, flying to destinations in the United States and the Caribbean region, and ""maybe even to Cuba one day.""

Hayes jovially thanked Leahy for making the joke about Boeing seats, so he wouldn't have to, and said he had a present for the people who built JetBlue's newest aircraft. ""We do have a gift,"" he said. ""We're a low-cost airline so it's a modest gift.""

He then informed the audience that a plaque will be installed in BluesMobile, dedicating the aircraft ""to the Airbus team for proudly bringing manufacturing excellence to the U.S., Mobile, Alabama, April 25, 2016.""

In return, the Airbus team presented JetBlue leaders with a painting showing BluesMobile flying over its namesake city.

Afterward, some of those on hand expressed a mix of pride about the milestone reached by Airbus, and anticipation about developments to come as the Mobile factory ramps up production and more subsidiary businesses move into the area to supply its needs.

""This is something that hundreds of people have worked on for 12 years,"" said former Alabama Gov. Bob Riley. He went on to describe Airbus' impact on the Mobile region as ""transformational.""

""I don't think they left a stone unturned,"" said former Mobile City Council member Reggie Copeland, who was particularly pleased at the nod to USA Jaguar pride.

Chip Schramm, president of Mobile-based Turner Supply, said he was present partly because his company had sold Airbus tool storage and manufacturing equipment for its Brookley facility. But he was also there, he said, because he anticipates how the impact of the plant will continue to develop. He foresees it driving Mobile to a role as a world-class manufacturing corridor.

""We're a fourth-generation family-owned business, so we take a long-term view of things anyway,"" Schramm said.

It was a mindset shared by Roger Wehner, executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority. People shouldn't look at ceremonial occasions such as Monday's delivery and get the impression that Mobile can rest on its laurels, he said. The next challenge is to continue developing Mobile's infrastructure so that as Airbus grows, it continues to find fertile ground on the shore of Mobile Bay.

""People think it's a sprint, but it's a marathon,"" he said."

How did Mobile win the Airbus heart?

How did Airbus meet your mother? It's been a long, twisted road from where we started in a tanker contract war with Boeing to where we are with a lucrative jobs-rich relationship with the French plane builder. Here's a quick twisted toon history ...

""Don't draw anybody nekkid"" 6-19-05

The courtship of Alabama and Airbus began in 2005 when the plane builder formerly known as EADS was sniffing around for an American soul mate. Gov. Bob riley and a posse of Mobile leaders were aggressive and charming suitors. This was my first cartoon on the subject. I was given specific instructions: ""Don't draw anybody nekkid.""

Boeing is a jealous, defensive, bullying competitor. One of their people implied Mobile workers would have trouble building tricycles on Christmas morning. Meanwhile, Boeing's own workers were missing delivery deadlines because of assembly malfunctions. Mobile remembers that tricycle reference.

""Size Does Matter"" 3-01-08

Three years later, after much politicking and drama from competitor Boeing, Airbus (EADS-Northrop Grumman) wins the contract to build refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force. The Airbus tanker was much larger and had more long-range capabilities than the Boeing model.

Introduction

April 4, 2016, © Leeham Co.: Boeing should forget about competing with Airbus for market share.

Airbus already has won the neo/MAX battle. This is a battleground Boeing will not retake for the lives of these airplanes.

Airbus has led Boeing in wide-body, passenger airplane sales for most of the past several years. (Boeing smashes Airbus in wide-body cargo aircraft sales.) This sector will remain competitive.

Instead, Boeing should concentrate on profit margin and roll the dice on a clean-sheet, new single-aisle airplane as its best hope of recovering the dominance it long held over Airbus.

Future flagship of airline’s long haul fleet for services to US and Europe

Philippine Airlines (PAL) will use the A350 XWB as the flagship of its future long-haul fleet, operating the highly efficient widebody aircraft on non-stop flights to the U.S. and new destinations in Europe

Philippine Airlines (PAL) has finalised a purchase agreement with Airbus covering the firm order of six A350-900s, plus six options. The contract firms up a Memorandum of Understanding announced earlier this year during the Singapore Airshow.The A350 XWB will become the flagship of PAL’s future long haul fleet and will be configured with a premium three class layout. The airline will operate the aircraft on non-stop flights to the US, as well as on services to new destinations in Europe.“We are pleased to finalise this important order and are now defining the final layout for the aircraft,” said Jaime J. Bautista, President & COO of Philippine Airlines. “With the A350 we will introduce a whole new level of comfort for long haul flights, with more personal space in all classes, a quieter cabin and the very latest on-board amenities. At the same time we will benefit from the A350’s enhanced efficiency and ability to fly non-stop on even our longest sector from New York to Manila, all year round.”“The order from Philippine Airlines underscores A350 XWB’s position as the aircraft of choice in the larger twin aisle category,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “The A350 XWB has set new standards, combining extra-long range capability with the lowest operating costs of any aircraft in its class. It will be the perfect aircraft for Philippine Airlines to reinforce its position as one of Asia’s leading premium carriers, especially on its longest intercontinental routes.”The A350 XWB is the newest member of the Airbus widebody family. Featuring the most modern aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, the A350 XWB brings a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs. For passengers the extra-wide cabin offers more personal space, including 18-inch wide seats as standard in economy class.To date, Airbus has recorded 783 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 42 customers worldwide, already making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever."
Asia travel lacks pilots to cope with travel boom: Airbus CEO - CNBC,"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDQvMTgvYXNpYS10cmF2ZWwtbGFja3MtcGlsb3RzLXRvLWNvcGUtd2l0aC10cmF2ZWwtYm9vbS1haXJidXMtY2VvLWJyZWdpZXItc2F5cy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTYvMDQvMTgvYXNpYS10cmF2ZWwtbGFja3MtcGlsb3RzLXRvLWNvcGUtd2l0aC10cmF2ZWwtYm9vbS1haXJidXMtY2VvLWJyZWdpZXItc2F5cy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"watch now

Asia faces a severe shortage of well-trained pilots as the region's demand for air travel skyrockets, Airbus's chief executive told CNBC. ""We believe that we will require close to 200,000 pilots for the region, whereas there are only 65,000 right now, in the next 20 years,"" Fabrice Bregier, president and CEO of the European planemaker, said on Tuesday. To meet that need, Airbus and Singapore Airlines launched a training center in Singapore this week, equipped with eight full-flight simulators and six cockpit training devices, and with the capacity to teach more than 10,000 trainees a year. ""There is a shortage of good, trained pilots and this is due to the growth of the region. Instead of sending the pilots to France or America, it is much better and efficient for everybody to have a center in Asia,"" Bregier said of the center, in which his company holds a 55 percent stake. The Airbus Asia Training Centre (AATC) in Singapore will be Airbus' largest one yet; the company has similar facilities in Toulouse, Miami and Beijing.

Twenty years of rapid economic development across Asia Pacific has bolstered income levels, creating a new wave of travel demand from middle-income households, while market liberalizations have enabled regional low-cost carriers (LCCS) to thrive. Even as China, the world's second-largest economy and a key catalyst for global tourism, experienced slower growth, aviation remained unaffected, Bregier said. Beijing reported a 1.1 percent increase in gross domestic product for the first three months of 2016 from the previous period, the lowest quarterly expansion on record since 2010. Mainland air traffic will grow by more than 10 percent a year for the next five years, according to Bregier, which will help many Asian countries achieve double-digit growth in their respective aviation markets. ""The start of the year was slow, but we confirm that we have a book-to-bill above one [a metric indicating that demand is outpacing supply] this year again. So the market is doing well, the traffic is growing,"" he said, adding that China's economic slowdown hadn't yet hit a pace that would be damaging to Airbus."

Marking a technological first for Airbus, the company has implemented a new industrial process that uses laser stripping to improve the return current from an aircraft’s electrical systems. This solution was applied by the A350 XWB project teams at Airbus’ Saint-Nazaire plant in France.On the A350 XWB’s centre fuselage section, all electrical systems are assembled outside of the aircraft, then integrated as a single unit throughout. In addition to this assembly, electrical tracks called “raceways” – which carry the return current – are installed, with all connection points stripped to ensure strong conductivity.The stripping of connection points previously was performed using a manual screwdriver and a countersink cutter with micrometric stops – however the results were not uniform, and it was difficult to ensure that measurements met Airbus standards. Moreover, this technique caused musculoskeletal disorders among operators’ aircraft.""Due to these observations, a project was launched in 2015, and after testing an initial alternative, we selected a laser machine manufactured by Meliad,” said Project Manager Romuald Sibileau. “This consists of a laser generator, a PC and a dust extraction system. The laser operates within a closed booth, and a red light comes on near the door to warn those outside when the laser is in operation.”Having completed special training, the operator – who wears safety glasses and a mask – simply selects the stripping diameter, positions the raceway below the laser with the help of stops and a centering pin, presses on a pedal to start the operation, and then checks the result at the end.Testing of the machine has been underway since February 2016, and the conclusions so far have been extremely positive – in terms of the conductivity measurements, as well as the visual appearance and ease of use for operators."

Delta Air Lines is reportedly close to another multi-billion dollar airplane order.

According to Reuters, three sources familiar with the matter say Delta is close to a deal for 37 Airbus A321ceo or ""current engine option"" jets.

This comes just days after news broke that the airline is also close to a 75-aircraft order for Bombardier's C-Series.

At list prices, the 37 jets have a total value of $4.25 billion.

However, with Airbus looking to fill out its production slots before the next generation A321neo arrives, Delta is likely to have negotiated a very substantial discount.

The rumored deal would be the third substantial order Delta has placed with Airbus in recent years, and the second for the A321ceo.

""No decision has been made on an aircraft order,"" a Delta spokesperson told Business Insider.

Related stories

Representatives from Airbus were not immediately available for comment.

The A321s from this order will likely be deployed as a more fuel-efficient alternative to Delta's fleet of almost 120 aging Boeing 757-200 jets.

The Atlanta-based airline currently boasts a fleet of 809 mainline jets from Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas with an average age of 17.1 years.

Delta looks to be keen to bring its fleet age in-line with its fellow legacy carriers American — which is at 11.2 years of age — and United — at 13.6 years.

In 2013, Delta ordered 30 A321s along with 10 A330-300 wide-body jets from Airbus. The first A321s from that order is expected to debut next week in Atlanta.

In late 2014, Delta returned to Airbus for a batch of 50 wide-body A350-900XWB and A330-900neos with a list value of more than $14 billion.

In recent years, Delta is earned a reputation for being highly effective at searching out and taking advantage of undervalued assets. In the mid-2000s, as others dumped their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 jets in favor of newer, more fuel efficient models, Delta picked them up second-hand for pennies on the dollar.

With the A321ceo nearing the end of its production life, it may have been the bargain Delta is looking for."

Third Delta A321ceo order in three years

U.S.-based Delta Air Lines’ order for 37 A321ceo aircraft was announced 29 April 2016, with each of these single-aisle jetliners to be powered by CFM56 engines from CFM International

Atlanta, Georgia (U.S.) – based Delta Air Lines has placed an order for 37 A321ceo aircraft. This order follows previous Delta orders for the Current Engine Option version of the largest Airbus A320 Family member in 2013 and 2014. Delta took delivery of its first A321 in March 2016. Including that aircraft and today’s announcement, Delta has ordered a total of 82 A321s. Each will be powered by CFM56 engines from CFM International.""The Airbus A320 family of aircraft continues to be a cost-efficient, reliable and customer-pleasing mainstay of our narrowbody fleet,"" said Ed Bastian, Delta's incoming chief executive. ""The order for the A321s is an opportunistic fleet move that enables us to produce strong returns and cost-effectively accelerate the retirement of Delta's 116 MD-88s in a capital efficient manner.""“Delta is an industry leader in many ways, not the least of which is contributing to the trend toward larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft for their single-aisle fleet,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “The A320 Family continues to be the backbone of every airline in the world that is paying attention to what their passengers want and their investors need. In 2015, nearly 40 percent of our A320 Family deliveries were A321s, up some 10 percent from the previous year. Our customers, like Delta, know where to find the best comfort, economy and reliability.”All of Delta’s A321s will feature fuel-saving Sharklets – lightweight composite wingtip devices that offer up to 4 percent fuel-burn savings. This environmental benefit gives airlines the option of extending their range up to 100 nautical miles/185 kilometres or increasing payload capacity by some 1000 pounds/450 kilograms.Many of Delta’s A321s will be delivered from the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. Aircraft assembly there began in July 2015, with the first aircraft, an A321ceo, being delivered April 25, 2016. By the end of 2017, the Mobile facility is expected to produce four aircraft per month, most going to Airbus’ U.S. customers.As of the end of March 2016, Delta was flying a fleet of 165 Airbus aircraft, including 127 A320 Family members and 38 A330 widebodies.

Can Boeing Push Out the Airbus A320 at United Airlines? - Fox Business,"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2Nhbi1ib2VpbmctcHVzaC1vdXQtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWF0LXVuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lc9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2Nhbi1ib2VpbmctcHVzaC1vdXQtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWF0LXVuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the first three months of 2016, United Continental has ordered 65 737-700 jets from Boeing to replace 50-seat regional jets that will be retired in the next few years. According to numerous analyst reports, Boeing may have given United Continental a discount of more than 70% on these purchases.

United has ordered 65 Boeing 737-700s this year -- at a steep discount. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Discounts from list price are normal for aircraft purchases, but they are typically closer to 50%. At the estimated sale price of $22 million to $24 million per aircraft, Boeing is probably losing money.

Boeing has stated that it offered such aggressive pricing to ""block"" Bombardier from gaining a foothold at a major airline for its new CSeries jet. Most analysts have assumed this was the rationale, as well. However, Boeing may have an even bigger aim: dislodging the Airbus A320 from United's narrowbody fleet.

The Boeing-Airbus battle at UnitedIn the early 1990s, United Airlines was Boeing's biggest customer -- and an extremely loyal one at that. The cozy relationship had deep historical roots. During the early 1930s, Boeing and United Airlines were part of the same company (United Aircraft and Transport Corporation), before federal regulators forced the conglomerate to split into three parts.

That made it all the more shocking when United Airlines made a deal with Airbus in 1992 to lease 50 A320s. United and Airbus executed a follow-up deal for the smaller A319 a few years later.

United Airlines now operates more than 150 A320-family aircraft. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Today, United Continental remains primarily a Boeing operator. However, it has 152 A319s and A320s in its fleet and plans to add another 14 used A319s over the next two years.

The Airbus fleet is agingWhile United has a substantial Airbus fleet today, the A319s and A320s are about 17 years old, on average. In fact, United's youngest Airbus planes were built in 2002. (The used A319s it will be leasing beginning this year are somewhat newer.)

Up until 2013, United Continental had planned to replace the bulk of its Airbus fleet between 2016 and 2020. By upgrading its A319s and A320s with larger overhead bins, slimline seats, satellite Wi-Fi, and streaming video, United has been able to keep these planes in service longer.

The drop in fuel prices over the past two years also makes it more economical to keep older planes flying. Nevertheless, United will need to replace all of its Airbus planes within the next 10 to 12 years or so.

Will United stick with the 737?Including its A320-series fleet, its 757 fleet, and its older 737s, United Airlines will probably need to replace at least 300 narrowbodies between now and the late 2020s. Aside from its order for 100 737 MAX 9 planes, United doesn't have any planes coming that are earmarked for this purpose.

As United Continental adds more and more Boeing 737s, it will become increasingly tempting for the company to simplify its fleet by standardizing on the 737 family for all of its narrowbody aircraft needs. That would put Boeing in line for hundreds more 737 MAX orders over the next decade.

Boeing has a shot at convincing United not to order any A320neo family planes. Image source: Airbus.

This seems like a more sensible explanation for why Boeing was willing to be so aggressive in selling 737-700s to United. Sure, Bombardier's CSeries is a small threat to the 737, but Airbus' A320 family is the key competitor in that segment.

With every 737 it sells to United today, Boeing gets a little bit closer to moving one of its biggest customers back to a single narrowbody fleet type. If United ever moves to an all-737 narrowbody fleet, there is little chance that it would later reverse course, as it would then lose the productivity benefits of simplifying its fleet.

As a result, Boeing has a realistic shot at turning United into an ""annuity-like"" customer that will need 20 to 30 new 737s every year. That's the kind of opportunity that can justify selling a few dozen airplanes below cost today.

Joint venture between Airbus and SIA to become Airbus’ largest flight crew training facility

The new Airbus Asia Training Centre (AATC), a joint venture owned 55% by Airbus and 45% by Singapore Airlines (SIA), was officially opened in Singapore today. The opening ceremony was hosted by Fabrice Brégier, President and Chief Executive Officer, Airbus and Goh Choon Phong, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Airlines, in the presence of S Iswaran, Minister of Trade and Industry (Industry) for the Republic of Singapore.

The 9,250 square metre facility in Singapore becomes the fourth Airbus flight crew training centre worldwide, alongside Toulouse, Miami and Beijing. The new centre offers type rating and recurrent training courses for all in-production Airbus types and when fully operational will be Airbus’ largest flight crew training facility, with eight full-flight simulators, comprising three A350 XWBs, one A380, two A330s and two A320s. The centre will also have six fixed cockpit training devices and extensive classroom facilities, with the capacity to offer courses for more than 10,000 trainees per year.

“We are extremely pleased to inaugurate, in partnership with Singapore Airlines, the latest addition to our global training network,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer. “The new centre combines the expertise of our two companies to offer the highest standards of training for the growing flight crew population in the Asia-Pacific region. Our investment in this joint venture is another example of our commitment at Airbus to bring our support services closer to our customers around the world, and especially in the key growth markets.”

Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong added: “The new facility provides exceptional training on state-of-the-art equipment, ensuring that AATC is a true centre of excellence in the Asia-Pacific region. With hundreds more new Airbus aircraft on firm order by the region’s airlines, we are confident that AATC will go from strength to strength.”

AATC began operations in April 2015 and prior to the opening of the new centre has been offering courses out of temporary facilities at the SIA Training Centre near Changi Airport. All operations are gradually being transferred to the new centre, located at Seletar Aerospace Park. Instructors have initially been drawn from Airbus and Singapore Airlines, with additional recruitment ongoing.

Seventeen airlines from Asia and the Pacific have already signed up to use the services of AATC, where the courses offered are identical to those at the existing Airbus flight crew training centres.

Airbus predicts that the Asia-Pacific region will lead demand for new aircraft in the coming years, with the in-service fleet growing from around 5,600 aircraft today to 14,000 over the next two decades. This will see the active flight crew population employed by airlines in the region increase from over 65,000 to almost 170,000, generating significant demand for flight crew training services.

In addition to its flight crew training centres in Toulouse, Miami, Beijing and Singapore, Airbus currently has engineering and maintenance training centres in Hamburg and Bangalore. Airbus also has agreements with third party service providers to offer Airbus training courses at their facilities.

Take a Tour of Airbus' Brand New A330neo Airspace Cabin - The Points Guy,"Wed, 06 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzA0L2luc2lkZS1haXJidXMtYTMzMG5lby1haXJzcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, TPG Editor-in-Chief Zach Honig is exploring the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany, where he had a chance to check out a mock-up of Airbus' Airspace cabin on the brand new A330neo.

Airbus has been working on its next-generation A330neo for quite some time now, with the program first announced at the Farnborough Air Show in 2014. Like with the latest A320, neo stands for New Engine Option, and the A330neo represents a huge step up in fuel efficiency, with a reported 14% improvement in fuel burn per seat. While fuel cost isn't nearly as much of a concern for airlines as it once was, the neo will still offer significant savings, reducing emissions at the same time.

The A330neo will also ship with Airbus' new Airspace cabin, an even more high-tech version of what you'll find in the A350 (the new Airspace will be an option for future A350 orders as well). Passengers can expect to find perks like quieter in-flight conditions (Airbus says it's 50% quieter than the Dreamliner), germ-fighting lavatories, much more storage for bags, LED accent lighting and, of course, the latest in-flight entertainment options.

While the planes are now in production, we're still more than a year away from the first airline flight with launch partner TAP Portugal, which currently operates a fleet of aging A330s on long-haul routes. In the meantime, Airbus has more or less finalized its cabin design, showing off Airspace to airline customers at AIX. And we got to stop by for a tour:

The mock-up cabin on display was broken up into three cabins: Business class, premium economy and coach. Airbus designed the cabin to create a ""love at first sight"" impression with entering passengers — it's definitely striking.

One design highlight is the interchangeable light panels, such as this one up above.

Airlines can create their own design, which can easily be swapped into the ceiling.

These custom panels can either be laser-cut or 3D-printed — both options are relatively inexpensive, making it easy for airlines to add custom design elements without a significant investment.

Airbus designed the cabin to create a feeling of space (hence the name). It does feel roomy, thanks to the lighting effects and higher ceilings throughout. Speaking of lighting, airlines can choose from any of 16 million colors — they're not stuck with the blue and purple configuration you see in these photos.

The A330neo has an entirely new bin design, making it possible to accommodate 66% more carry-on bags.

The bin doors are curved while the handles follow a straight line. Apparently Airbus has received feedback that straight lines convey quality, so the manufacturer has done away with its curved handles here.

The lavatories have also been completely overhauled, with mood lighting, anti-bacterial surfaces, an ""aroma dispenser"" and touchless controls on the toilet, sink and garbage bin.

Business Class

While the ""real"" economy seats likely won't be much different from what we saw in the mock-up (from a functionality perspective), the business-class seats are an entirely different story.

Airbus had sample business seats arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, which is likely the layout carriers will select. However, the seats themselves are strictly for illustrative purposes.

Launch partner TAP, for example, has announced that it plans to use a seat from Recaro called the CL6710, which actually made its first appearance at this same trade show back in 2014. It's a staggered lie-flat seat, similar to what you'll find on many airlines, such as my recent Garuda Indonesia flight from Bali to Tokyo — though the CL6710 appears to be an improvement over that seat.

The A330neo will be a huge step up from TAP's existing A330 in both cabins. For example, the airline's current business class is angle-flat (on most aircraft), so the Recaro seat will be a very welcome change. TAP operates its A330s on flights between Lisbon and Porto and the United States, so I imagine the A330neo will replace those planes on key routes.

Premium Economy

Just behind the A330neo's entrance is a small premium economy cabin.

Premium economy is optional, of course. For example, TAP has opted to install regular economy seats plus a section of extra-legroom seats, rather than offering an additional cabin between business and coach.

If airlines choose to install premium economy seats, they'll probably be quite a bit wider than coach — think domestic first class on flights within the US.

The demo seats reminded me a bit of what Norwegian has installed on its Dreamliners. Airlines will likely opt for leather seats instead of the cloth Airbus used here, which can be tricky to clean. Airbus had premium economy seats arranged in a 2-3-2 configuration, making them a bit wider than what you'll find in coach.

Economy Seats

Located just behind premium economy were two rows of regular coach seats.

The cabin mock-up was quite a bit shorter than what you'll find on a real plane — the extra seats up above are simply painted onto the wall.

Airbus is firmly advising airlines to install seats that are a minimum of 18 inches wide, allowing passengers enough shoulder space to sit comfortably.

Airbus believes that seat width is far more important than pitch — if given a choice between having a wide seat or one with extra legroom, passengers would prefer width, apparently.

An 18-inch width matches what many carriers currently have installed on this aircraft type, including Delta, which operates a fleet of A330s on international flights. These demo seats still had a fair amount of legroom, but certainly nothing to write home about.

Of course, airlines will likely opt to install the latest IFE in their A330neo aircraft, but it's up to them to make that pick. Either way, Airbus said that it's important for in-flight entertainment to be built entirely into the seat back (as many recent devices are) to avoid taking up precious floor space.

Bottom Line

Airbus Airspace is definitely the most high-end commercial cabin offering to date. It's going to be a pleasure to fly when it launches next year — while passengers are unlikely to go out of their way to fly the A330 now, Airbus hopes that'll change with the introduction of the A330neo.

Delta orders 37 Airbus A321 to replace MD88 - Business Insider,"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVsdGEtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtb3JkZXItYmlsbGlvbi0yMDE2LTTSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2RlbHRhLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLW9yZGVyLWJpbGxpb24tMjAxNi00P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Delta Airbus A321ceo. Airbus

Delta Air Lines has placed an order for 37 Airbus A321ceo airliners.

This comes a day after the Atlanta-based company announced the purchase of 75 Bombardier CS100 airliners.

At list prices the 37 jets have a total value of $4.25 billion.

But with Airbus looking to fill out its production slots before the next-generation A321neo arrives, Delta is likely to have negotiated a substantial discount to the tune more than 50% off list price.

This is the third substantial order Delta has placed with Airbus in recent years, and the second for the A321ceo.

""The order for the A321s is an opportunistic fleet move that enables us to produce strong returns and cost-effectively accelerate the retirement of Delta’s 116 MD-88s in a capital-efficient manner,"" Delta's incoming CEO, Ed Bastian, said in a statement.

The A321s from this order will also likely be deployed as a more fuel-efficient alternative to Delta's fleet of almost 120 aging Boeing 757-200 jets.

Related stories

The Atlanta-based airline has a fleet of 809 mainline jets from Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas with an average age of 17.1 years.

Delta looks to be keen to bring its fleet age in-line with its fellow legacy carriers American, which is at 11.2 years of age, and United, at 13.6 years.

In 2013, Delta ordered 30 A321s along with 10 A330-300 wide-body jets from Airbus. The first A321 from that order is expected to enter service next week.

In late 2014, Delta returned to Airbus for a batch of 50 wide-body A350-900XWB and A330-900neo's with a list value of more than $14 billion.

In recent years, Delta has earned a reputation for being highly effective at searching out and taking advantage of undervalued assets. In the mid-2000s, as others dumped their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 jets in favor of newer, more fuel-efficient models, Delta picked them up secondhand for pennies on the dollar.

Delta's deal to become the Bombardier C-Series' US launch customer came with a substantial discount. Although the deal has a list price of $5.6 billion, a source told Business Insider that Delta received a 65% to 70% discount.

The 37 A321s in the order is expected to be delivered by 2019."

Bjorn’s Corner: C Series flight controls - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC8yOS9iam9ybnMtY29ybmVyLWMtc2VyaWVzLWZsaWdodC1jb250cm9scy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"29April 2016, ©. Leeham Co: With the order by Delta Air Lines, the Bombardier C Series has taken the step up to be a viable alternative to Airbus’ and Boeing’s single aisle 130-150 seat aircraft.

In my description of airliners’ flight control and Flight Management Systems (FMS), I have focused on the established mainline single aisle players. Time to change that; C Series has arrived and will stay in the mainline segment.

Why 130 seats as a limit? Because below 130 seats there are a number of additional players (Embraer, Sukhoi, Mitsubishi…) and we can’t describe them all right now.

Now to how Bombardier has implemented the flight controls, autopilot and FMS for the C Series. In fact, we will look at how they have made the C Series cockpit, Figure 1.

I haven’t flown the C Series yet (working on it!) but I have been able to glean quite a bit over time and spent quite some time in the cockpit with the Bombardier test pilots at the Paris Air Show.

So here is a shot at describing the C Series control philosophies and capabilities and how they mimic/differ from Airbus and Boeing.

Flight control

C Series is a Fly By Wire (FBW) aircraft with a passive side stick controller, very much like an Airbus. As discovered during my A350 flight, this is OK. Active feedback sidesticks would have been better, but they were not available to the C Series project.

The throttles are like Boeing throttles; they are back-driven, i.e., one can see and feel when the auto throttle is working, which is good. This is typical of the C Series. It takes the best ideas from Airbus and Boeing and puts them together. In some instances, the C Series team had own ideas where they beat both the mainline legacies. One is the radio control panel. It is up at the glare shield (shared control panel with the display and navigation controls), where it should be, taken from their Biz jets.

The FBW flight laws are Boeing’s, as I understand it, i.e., the aircraft is speed-stable like a classical aircraft. I haven’t flown the Boeing laws, but had no problem with the C* laws for the Airbus. Look at my previous corners to get the lowdown on flight laws, here, here and here.

The FBW envelope protection is mostly Airbus. Angle-of-attack and load-factor have hard limits (Boeing also has hard limits for angle of attack for 787 when slats/flaps are deployed, I’ve been told), and this works well. High speed protection is a bit nicer done than Airbus. It reduces the throttles, but then it doesn’t raise the nose like the Airbus; it deploys the airbrakes. There is no change in the aircraft’s trajectory, a nice touch.

Avionics and FMS

The avionics suite is the same as for the Bombardier high end business jets, Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion, Figure 2. It has some really good features.

All display and control functions are made to keep the pilot’s eyes looking up and/or out. The only important items on the central console are the throttles and the roller-ball/keyboard FMS input devices. Pro Line Fusion has total flexibility how the five large screens are used.

They can combine Primary Flight Display (PFD) with approach plates or Navigation Display (ND). Virtually any partitioning of the screens is possible. Note that the ND has both lateral and vertical displays, like the A350 and A380. A real important safety feature is the availability of synthetic 3D terrain superimposed on the artificial horizon for the Primary Flight Display. Instrument flying, which is hard work for the human brain, becomes a breeze with synthetic vision. Head Up Displays (HUDs) are optional for the cockpit and they show exactly the PFD picture, including synthetic vision.

The FMS is mouse-oriented with a tabbed interface, just like the A350 FMS. It seems to have a stricter flight phase structure than the more classical FMS on the Airbus jets.

The autopilot control panel (in the middle of the glare shield, in Figure 3 to the right) looks very much like that on the Boeing aircraft, which is good. I expect it to have the same logical division into Lateral and Vertical navigation modes. Airbus has a more mixed setup which has to do with their special throttle handling.

What I like about the C Series that neither Airbus nor Boeing have is the glare shield-based radio controls. For the duopoly aircraft, this is a heads-down exercise, much better to have your eyes close to where the action is, your outside and the PFD/HUD. Overall, the heads up and out cockpit philosophy is commendable.

Summary

C Series is an aircraft project that has got a lot of tricky technical decisions right. It’s hard to find where they should have taken another path.

This hitting the right path at the junctures seems to have continued on the cockpit/pilot interaction side as well. Can’t wait to fly the thing.

First order of the A320neo in Africa

Ivory Coast flag carrier Air Côte D’Ivoire’s firm order announced 28 April 2016 includes two A320ceo (current engine option) aircraft, along with two A320neo (new engine option) versions

Air Côte D’Ivoire, the national airline of Ivory Coast based in Abidjan, has signed a firm order for two A320neo and two A320 aircraft. The agreement makes Air Côte D’Ivoire the first African airline to order the A320neo. The airline’s first purchase agreement directly with Airbus also makes Air Côte D’Ivoire a new customer.Air Côte D’Ivoire selected the A320 Family for its wider cabin, low operating costs and excellent fuel efficiency.

Airbus executives write staff letter warning of Brexit dangers - The Guardian,"Mon, 04 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2Fwci8wNC9haXJidXMtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1icmV4aXQtd2FybmluZy1sZXR0ZXItdWstZXXSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNi9hcHIvMDQvYWlyYnVzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtYnJleGl0LXdhcm5pbmctbGV0dGVyLXVrLWV1?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has told its staff that a vote to leave the EU could choke off future investment in the UK.

Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in the UK to design and manufacture aircraft wings, said it was committed to its British operations regardless of the referendum result. But it said a vote to leave could make it rethink future decisions about where to invest the group’s money. In a letter signed by six senior Airbus executives, the company said: “We simply don’t know what ‘out’ looks like.”

The aerospace giant’s letter came as a survey of Lloyd’s insurance workers found an overwhelming majority believe a British exit would be bad for the country’s £60bn insurance industry, and the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange gave vocal support for the EU.

The Airbus letter, whose signatories include the firm’s UK president, Paul Kahn, said senior staff “firmly believe that it makes good economic sense to stay inside the EU”.

The letter said: “Should the British electorate have a different view then clearly we wouldn’t cease our activities in the UK, which are highly important and very prominent. However, our business model is entirely based on our ability to move products, people and ideas around Europe without any restriction and we do not believe leaving will increase the competitiveness of our British-based operations. We all need to keep in the back of our minds that future investments depend very much on the economic environment in which the company operates.”

Airbus UK designs and engineers wings for aircraft, including the giant A380 “superjumbo”, at a facility in Filton, south Gloucestershire. The wings are made on the Welsh side of the border with England, at Broughton, near Chester.

Airbus estimates that its wing operations support about 100,000 jobs through the supply chain.

About 70% of insurance professionals said leaving the EU would either hurt or severely damage 300-year-old Lloyd’s of London, the world’s biggest insurance market. But 6.2% said that leaving the EU would benefit the industry, according to a survey by City of London consultancy Haggie Partners.

The campaign to remain in Europe also won vociferous support from Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of London Stock Exchange, which is in the midst of a merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse. Rolet said a Brexit would not only do damage the UK economy but could also cause economic problems around the world.

“I think this would be a geopolitical event that would reverberate way beyond the European Union,” he said. “I think it would be devastating to the economy of the United Kingdom, and would not be good for anyone with their headquarters in the European Union. The gaze of the United States would have to move back towards Europe, with a view to putting Humpty Dumpty back together again,” he told The Daily Telegraph.

Chief executives of 36 British major companies including easyJet, BAE Systems and Shell signed a letter in February, in support of the UK’s continued membership of the EU. But advocates of the UK leaving the EU point to support from around 250 business figures, including former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan and Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross."

Airbus stocks closed 4.8 percent lower at the Paris stock exchange on Thursday after the European aeronautics company unveiled a first-quarter net profit of 399 million euros ($453 million) - down 50 percent from 792 million euros in the same period last year. Sales were up slightly to 12.2 billion euros, from 12.1 billion euros in 2015.

Airbus blamed troubles with its A400M military transport plane and the suspension of export credit financing for the fall. In addition, the group said it was suffering temporary supply chain problems with the narrow-bodied A320neo plane and its A350 XWB long-range, twin-engine jet as it tried to reduce outstanding work and control costs while increasing production.

Airbus group chief executive Tom Enders, therefore, called 2016 ""the challenging year we anticipated,"" but added that the planemaker would maintain its full-year profit forecast.

""Despite these challenges we maintain our 2016 guidance and also our earnings and cash growth story for the coming years,"" he said in a statement, stressing that Airbus still had strong orders for commercial planes and expected to ramp up aircraft production.

Technical problems

Enders admitted Airbus was facing a ""serious challenge"" for production and customer deliveries of the A400M military transport plane because of a problem discovered in the propeller gearbox. ""It's very frustrating but we'll have to work through this with our engine partners,"" he said.

Chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm said the gearbox would have to be modified, and insisted ""we're working hard"" with engine-maker General Electric to fix the problems.

The final cost of the A400M engine woes, including the technical, commercial and industrial implications, are hard to judge, but according to Wilhelm they ""could be significant.""

Regarding its A320neo plane, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney had promised to deliver engines for aircraft delivery from mid-2016, meaning production could accelerate in the second half of the year.

Threat from Qatar Airways

In comments likely to step up pressure on the aircraft maker, the head of Qatar Airways on Thursday threatened to cancel an order for Airbus A320neo planes if the European manufacturer failed to address engine issues.

""When we buy an aeroplane, we expect all the terms and conditions and performance guarantees that are in the agreement to be followed by the manufacturer,"" Akbar al-Baker said in an interview with Dubai-based satellite channel Al-Arabiya. This was not the case with regard to the A320neo because the engine was underperforming.

""There are other issues with the aeroplane. So unless these issues are fully resolved as per the contract that we have signed, we will not take the delivery,"" he said.

Qatar Airways was due to take the first delivery of 50 such planes in December, but rejected the aircraft, citing problems with the engine.

The head of the government-owned airline threatened to walk away from the order and seek an alternative supplier. ""We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B and we will implement plan B if this problem with the aeroplane is not resolved as soon as possible.""

Baker also said Airbus was behind schedule in delivering six planes this year, which was unacceptable because it was impeding Qatar Airways' expansion plans.

Despite the problems, Airbus has maintained its overall forecast for 650 aircraft deliveries in 2016. It may feel encouraged by news from the Ivory Coast where the country's national airline, Air Côte D'Ivoire, has ordered two A320neo and two A320 aircraft - the first African airline to order the A320neo and its first purchase agreement directly with Airbus.

Airbus Reports A400M Engine Gearbox Problems Will Cause Delays - Defense News,"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wNC8yOC9haXJidXMtcmVwb3J0cy1hNDAwbS1lbmdpbmUtZ2VhcmJveC1wcm9ibGVtcy13aWxsLWNhdXNlLWRlbGF5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was originally published on April 28. It has been updated to correct a sales figure in the penultimate paragraph.



PARIS — Airbus faces a potentially heavy financial hit due to problems on the engine gearbox of the A400M military transport plane, the European aircraft company said in a ​statement Thursday.



""On the military side, we are now facing a serious challenge for production and customer deliveries of the A400M due to new, unexpected issues on the engine propeller gearbox,"" Tom Enders, Airbus group chief executive, said in the statement with first-quarter financial results.



""It’s very frustrating but we’ll have to work through this with our engine partners,"" he said.



Airbus warned there could be a ""significant"" cost in repairing the gearbox.





""Overall, the cost at completion assessment will need to be adapted accordingly, but at this stage there is not a sufficiently mature view of the technical, commercial and industrial consequences and their potential impact on the financial statements, which could be significant,"" the company said.

That statement leaves open the possibility of further financial charges on top of the €5 billion (US $5.7 billion) incurred on problems on the four-engine airlifter.

A deep industrial and technical study is underway to find short- and long-term solutions, the company said. Negotiations with clients are continuing on a revised schedule for installing mission capabilities and delivery of the aircraft.

The four turboprop engines on the A400M are built by a European consortium comprising ITP of Spain, MTU of Germany, Rolls-Royce and Safran. Avio Aero, an Italian subsidiary of General Electric, builds the gearbox.

Airbus group reported a drop in operating profit to €501 million from €651 million a year ago, on stable sales of €12.2 billion after €12.1 billion. The financial outlook for the full year was stable, with deliveries of the civil airliners, cash and earnings expected to be toward the end of the year, the company said.

Launch customers of the A400M are Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain and Turkey, with Malaysia also buying the plane. The negotiations on a new delivery schedule are being held through OCCAR, the European procurement agency."

- Airbus Defence and Space will supply its highest-precision Fiber Optic Gyro Unit for the NASA JPL/CNES/Canadian Space Agency/UK Space Agency Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission - U.S. missions will carry all versions of the Fiber Optic Gyro Astrix® family

Airbus Defence and Space, the world’s second largest space company, will supply its highest-precision Fiber Optic Gyro Unit (FOG) for a mission led by the American, French, Canadian, and United Kingdom Space agencies, NASA, CNES, CSA, and UKSA, that will launch in 2020 to study Earth’s surface water.

Through a contract signed recently between Airbus Defence and Space and NASA‘s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the gyro will be integrated at the heart of the KaRIn (Ka-band Radar Interferometer) instrument.

""This is a new milestone in the Astrix® family success story. Future US missions will deploy versions of the Astrix® Series products - Astrix®120, Astrix®200 and Astrix®1090,” said Jean-Pierre Domenget, Head of Space Equipment. “The Astrix®200 design uses the Fiber Optic Gyro technology that can be integrated into the heart of the Instrument without creating thermal or mechanical distortions. The high-precision Astrix®200 gyro will measure the roll parameters which will enhance the performance of the instrument that measures water surface height,” Domenget added.

Airbus Defence and Space’s Astrix® family of Fiber Optic Gyros supplies very high accuracy rotation rate data with extremely low noise, crucial for space systems stabilization, pointing, and attitude control. Developed in cooperation with iXSea, the state-of-the-art Astrix® products provide the highest performances on the market. Together with high-reliability, more than 15 years of continuous operation, low power consumption, low mass, quick start and versatile interfaces, they are ideally suited to any space application, from Earth observation to telecommunications satellites. The Astrix® products have already accumulated flight heritage of one million hour in orbit (as of end 2015) and have been selected by 10 customers worldwide. Airbus Defence and Space continues to develop innovative guidance, navigation and control solutions including the new Astrix®1090 NEO that will provide telecommunications level performance while significantly reducing a satellite’s equipment cost.

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission aims to provide a better understanding of the world's oceans and terrestrial surface waters. U.S., French and Canadian oceanographers and hydrologists, together with international partners, have joined forces to develop this new space mission to carry out the first global survey of Earth's surface water, observe ocean surfaces in fine detail, and measure how bodies of water change over time.

More trouble for Airbus A400M military plane - DW (English),"Fri, 01 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tbWlsaXRhcnktdHJhbnNwb3J0LXBsYW5lLWhpdHMtbW9yZS10cm91YmxlL2EtMTkxNTg5MTfSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vYWlyYnVzLWE0MDBtLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXRyYW5zcG9ydC1wbGFuZS1oaXRzLW1vcmUtdHJvdWJsZS9hLTE5MTU4OTE3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The torturous development process of the A400M transport plane has been extended yet again after Germany's Defense Ministry admitted that it had been hit more technical problems. Its latest delivery date is now in doubt.

Germany's list of military equipment calamities was extended once again on Friday, when the country's biggest newspaper reported that the new European transporter plane, the Airbus A400M Atlas, had faulty engines.

The ""Bild"" newspaper reported that parts of the propeller engines could not cope with extreme temperatures and that individual parts of the engine were found to have ""material flaws."" The newspaper also claimed that one engine on a British A400M had cut out during a flight, though this had not yet happened to the three planes already owned by Germany's air force.

The Defense Ministry confirmed the report on Friday. ""Yes, it's true that the airplane manufacturer has found problems with the propeller engine,"" a spokeswoman for the ministry told the Reuters news agency before adding that the Italian company that manufactures the engines for Airbus was analyzing the problems and that Airbus had offered to repair the engines free of charge.

The ministry added that the nine new A400Ms that Germany has already ordered - which are currently being manufactured - were also being checked, though it remained unclear when they would be delivered. ""We don't yet have a current delivery plan for this year,"" the spokeswoman said.

Extra costs for the taxpayer

The development of the four-engine Airbus plane has become a saga of faults and misfires. Initially, its main problem was being overweight, and thus unable to carry the military vehicles it needed to.

But after its budget began to balloon - currently to over 20 billion euros ($23 billion), according to the ""Defense Industry Daily"" - it soon became clear that the project would be unable to break even without sales to countries outside NATO. The only trouble: The constant delays meant that many potential customers, such as South Africa, began looking elsewhere for alternatives - or even suing Airbus for compensation.

The A400M finally had its maiden flight in 2009, but the first aircraft was only delivered to France's air force in August 2013. The Germans did not get their first aircraft until a year later.

In May 2015, one A400M intended for Turkey's air force crashed during a test flight in Spain as a result of engine failure caused by a software glitch. In response, Germany was one of several countries to ground all their A400Ms.

In December, Germany's Defense Ministry secured the promise of a compensation payment from Airbus because of the delays. But members of the parliament's defense committee criticized the figure - 13 million euros - as too low, on the grounds that the costs to the German taxpayer would be ""several times higher,"" as Rainer Arnold, defense policy spokesman for the Social Democrats, put it.

Future problems

A few weeks ago, parliamentary and military sources were quoted in the press saying that the German air force was considering planes from other manufacturers to ""complement"" the A400M - not because of the late delivery, but because it did not have all the capabilities that the air force required.

But, despite nominal plans to complete construction of the new planes this year, Germany's Defense Ministry admitted on Friday that it did not know whether Airbus would actually be able deliver new planes in 2016.

Tobias Lindner, the defense spokesman for the Greens, described hopes that the new plane could be finished this year as ""extremely unrealistic,"" because the new engine problems would cause more delays.

The fate of the A400M is doubly unfortunate because it was poised to take a significant market share from the US Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules. If the plane is ever successful, industry experts believe that it could also pose a serious threat to Russian transport planes such as the AN-70, the IL-76 and the AN-124.

In 2014, the A400M became one of several overspending defense projects (including the Eurofighter and the Tiger helicopter) to be assessed by the international consultancy KPMG at the behest of the German government.

It concluded that one major problem was that Germany's military procurement authority, the BAAINBw, was severely understaffed. Not only that, KPMG also noticed that the delays to projects created waves of inefficiency that rippled throughout the military. As the weekly ""Die Zeit"" pointed out in 2015, if the air force only has three A400Ms, it makes no sense to train pilots to fly them, but when the planes are finally rolled out, the air force will suddenly lack trained pilots."

Airbus is providing immersive experiences with the company’s passenger cabins of tomorrow – leveraging “smart glasses” that integrate state-of-the-art 3D data technology for virtual, interactive tours of future aircraft interiors and their advanced functionalities.“Visits” with smart glasses – developed by Airbus virtual reality experts together with the company’s cabin marketing team – already are proving to be a major success with customers during trips to Airbus facilities, as well as with trade show attendees.At the heart of the smart glasses is a high-resolution smartphone, which features a special Airbus app. The smartphone is clipped to a headset and once the app is launched, the virtual reality experience can begin. By focusing on a specific point, the user decides where to go – choosing from different aircraft, first or business class, galley concepts and more.Inside the virtual cabin, visitors can pull out galley units, take a closer look at the lavatory or zoom in on details. Additional apps offer the possibility to compare seat colours, mood lighting designs and other options. Move your head up, down, or to the side and your view moves along the virtual cabin wall accordingly.While the customer is exploring the cabin, an Airbus representative can follow his or her path on a tablet. “This way, we can answer questions directly and point out differences between module versions, for example,” said Airbus’ Dieter Kasch, who last year – along with his virtual reality team – brought the smart glasses to maturity during a period of only three months.The demonstrator was first used at the Aircraft Interiors Expo held April 2015 in Hamburg, Germany and generated significant attention – leading to further development. By the following September, when Airbus attended the APEX EXPO cabin event in Portland, Oregon, USA, the glasses already offered a much wider range of information.“We couldn’t take the large physical mock-ups, but we were able to present all Airbus aircraft types complete with a cabin and all innovations,” explained Denise Kühl of Airbus’ aircraft interiors marketing team. “Our stand was more successful than ever at this important cabin event. The glasses were a big hit.”Soon, 15 sets of smart glasses will be in operation worldwide with Airbus’ local customer support and airline marketing teams in Dubai and Washington, D.C. – to be followed by Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong."
Airbus Wants Your Delivery Drone Designs - Popular Science,"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWlzLXNwb25zb3JpbmctZGVsaXZlcnktZHJvbmUtZGVzaWduLWNvbnRlc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Drones today are inadequate. While the basics of simple unmanned flying machines are simple enough, if drones are going to revolutionize how people do anything, they’ll need to do much more, within the basic confines of their design. So Local Motors, a Phoenix-based open-source manufacturing company, is partnering with Airbus Group to design a cargo drone for the future.

They’re holding a contest, with submissions open until May 22nd. Voting on the entrees will begin on June 5th. Here are some of the requirements for the design:

Vertical takeoff and landing

At least one fixed wing, for flying like a plane

Must use between 4 and 10 rotors/propellers for lift and thrust

Weigh no more than 55 pounds when fully loaded

Maximum wingspan of 16 feet

Maximum length of 13 feet

No single part can be longer than 6 feet 6 inches, so that the parts can be broken up for transport

Must be able to carry an 11-pound cargo over 37 miles and a 6.5-pound cargo over 62 miles

Must have a payload bay with exact dimensions that can be reached from the bottom of the aircraft

Cruising speed must be at least 50 mph

Maximum speed can’t be greater than 120 mph

Has to be powered by rechargeable batteries

Must be able to fly in sustained winds of 22 mph.

That’s a lot of requirements, and there are more details at the contest page.

Here are my favorite of the designs submitted so far:

SkyPac I particularly like the tube at the center, which reminds me of pneumatic tube systems from banks. The idea that this drone could dock, disgorge its contents into a tube system, take on a new package, and fly away is pretty neat.

DAR-X4 I like the engines hidden in the wings for vertical takeoff, with the rear thruster providing forward momentum in flight. I also like that it seems to be a body draped over a cargo compartment in the back. Feels slightly alien, which isn’t a bad thing.

M-PROP concept In the 1950s and the 1960s, the USAF experimented with a lot of tail-sitting planes, that launched from small pads oriented like rockets and flew in the air like planes. The designs failed for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the strain on the human pilots. I like M-PROP, which is explicitly inspired by one of these tail-sitting planes, because it does the same thing but without a human inside to worry about. Local Motors asked us to specify that the design is not up to the contest specifications."

Airbus Helicopters has handed over the first two of five lightweight military multi-role H145M helicopters to the Royal Thai Navy. This marks an important milestone in the H145M program on its way to the final acceptance and entry into service in Thailand at the end of 2016.

A delegation from the Royal Thai Navy and Airbus Helicopters Germany CEO Wolfgang Schoder participated in the ceremony at Airbus Helicopters´ Donauwörth site.

“After the H145M made its market entry with the German Air Force at the end of last year, we are very proud that the Royal Thai Navy has become another operator of the new H145M,” said Schoder. “The helicopter is the most advanced solution for the increasingly challenging demands of our military customers in modern-day missions. It combines state-of-the-art technologies, outstanding performance and true multi-role capabilities while maintaining very high versatility and low operating costs.”

The H145M is the military version of the civil H145 that entered service in mid-2014 and has recently reached the milestone of 15,000 flying hours in customer operations. With a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tons, the H145M can be used for a wide range of military operations including naval, utility, reconnaissance, search-and-rescue (SAR), medical evacuation and armed scout.

The Royal Thai Navy H145M is equipped with multi-purpose pylons including aerodynamic fairings, cargo hooks, hoists, HF system for SAR operations, weather radar, internal long range fuel tank system and fixed provisions for future special operations upgrade.

These two H145M helicopters will stay in Germany for pilot training at Airbus Helicopters’ Training Academy. All helicopters are scheduled for delivery in Thailand by September 2016.

Designed as a true military multi-role helicopter, the H145M offers a single platform, which is able to perform day and night missions in harsh weather conditions and difficult terrain. Its large mission equipment range, depending on the customer configuration, increases mission flexibility for military operators.

The helicopter’s Helionix digital avionics suite — incorporating the in-house developed four-axis autopilot — is designed to reduce crew workload while providing high levels of safety and improved situational awareness. The H145M is powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 2E equipped with full authority digital engine control. Its low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

The H145 helicopter family has proven its value for military customers for many years. For instance, the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), the launch customer for the H145M, has ordered 15 of these helicopters in a Special Forces configuration. The third helicopter will be delivered in the coming days."
Airbus vs Boeing Space bin - who wins? - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Thu, 07 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC8wNy9haXJidXMtdnMtYm9laW5nLXNwYWNlLWJpbi13aG8td2lucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The correct answer is as passengers – we all do.

Good morning from the floor area Aircraft Interiors Expo 2016 where I’ve been playing with overhead bins.

Yes again.

Why? Well apart from the satisfying sound of a lock clunking, it’s good news the both major airframers are developing deeper bins.

As airlines continue to pile on fees, or unbundle their posits, there are a lot of airline customers who are carrying the world and their kitchen sink when they board their planes.

The net result is what we see today – the mass push to board the plane to get overhead bin space (and speaking from experience – getting on the plane early was sometimes the only reason to hang onto elite status)

Here’s the new overhead bins for those who have forgotten what they look like.

First up – Airbus:

Airbus Pivot-Bin mocked up against an A320 fuselage – images, Economy Class and Beyond.

Boeing Space Bin mocked up against a 737 fuselage – Images, Economy Class and Beyond

The Airbus pivot bin is flying aboard Delta Airlines, whilst the Boeing space bin is being launched by Alaska Airline.

And hopefully – more airlines will choose these overhead bins.

There are good reasons to – it will cut the request for gate checking of luggage (costing time and resources on the ground), and hopefully speed up passenger throughput as they board the plane.

For passengers there will be one important different – and that’s how they stow their cases – which will now need to be placed in sideways.

However, whilst these bins are one hell of the step in the right direction, there is a downside.

So far, all the overhead bins have been shown with the same sized luggage, and it being within dimensions.

If like you all to name a time that happens – and you’re correct – it doesn’t happen

But still – with larger overhead bins coming from both major airframers – maybe, just maybe a plane will take off once without someone who really needs their bag (for example – leaving medicine behind)… and it’s trapped in the hold.

Bombardier's New Plane Gets a Lift From Delta Order (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDQvMjkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbC13aXRoLWRlbHRhLWdpdmVzLWEtbGlmdC10by1ib21iYXJkaWVycy1uZXctcGxhbmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OTTAWA — The Canadian plane maker Bombardier said on Thursday that Delta Air Lines had agreed to buy 75 of its new CSeries airliners, a deal that could bring stability to Bombardier’s attempts to challenge Boeing and Airbus directly.

Based on list price, Bombardier said the Delta order, for the CS100 aircraft, was worth about $5.6 billion. Like automobile buyers, however, airlines generally do not pay the posted price, and Delta is known as a canny negotiator. Delta has taken options for an additional 50 aircraft beyond the 75.

Stumbles within Bombardier, combined with particularly aggressive competition from its larger rivals, had led many analysts to question Bombardier’s decision to try leveraging its success in the market for small regional jets by building an airplane that could compete directly with the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.

The support from a major airline, after a recent letter of intent from Air Canada to buy 45 of the CSeries planes, may begin to dispel speculation that Bombardier may have to abandon the project. The development of the CSeries has created a financial drain for the company, which struggled to find buyers."
"A winner for all: The A380 helps airports, passengers and airlines stay ahead at busy hubs - Airbus","Fri, 08 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA0LWEtd2lubmVyLWZvci1hbGwtdGhlLWEzODAtaGVscHMtYWlycG9ydHMtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1hbmQtYWlybGluZXMtc3RheS1haGVhZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350 XWB and A380 DETAILS<br /> FARNBOROUGH AIRSHOW 2014<br /> Airbus’ 21st century flagship A380, which is the world’s largest aircraft, is a star of the Farnborough International Airshow<br />

Airbus’ A380 is making its mark on the world’s busiest hubs – opening up new opportunities for these airports, as well as their passengers and airlines – with the aircraft’s unmatched spaciousness, efficiency and comfort.Currently operating at some 50 destinations, the double-deck, 544-seat-capacity A380 is helping airports across the globe boost capacity, attract more passengers, increase revenue, free up slots at their gates, and reduce landing fees – benefits for both airlines and travellers.Capacity-constrained major international travel hubs such as London’s Heathrow and Hong Kong International Airport operate many scheduled A380 flights daily, and have seen the enormous benefits of Airbus’ 21st century flagship jetliner.“The A380 has helped us to grow the number of passengers using Heathrow to around 75 million people last year,” said John Holland-Kaye, Chief Executive Officer of Heathrow Airport. “It’s the largest plane in the world, it helps us serve more passengers on very busy routes out of Heathrow and it also frees up slots to serve new routes in North America, South America and Asia that we would not otherwise be able to serve.”Another example of the A380’s success is at Hong Kong International Airport – Asia’s busiest hub, which has had more than 5,000 A380 services to date. Fred Lam, Hong Kong International Airport’s CEO, said Airbus’ double-deck aircraft is a true passenger magnet and Hong Kong International Airport is incentivizing airlines to operate bigger aircraft.“We are almost reaching capacity,” Lam said. “One of the ways we feel we can continue to have passenger growth is to use our charging mechanism to encourage the airlines to switch to bigger aircraft so that with a similar number of slots they would be able to bring more passengers to our airport in the future, and make it cheaper per passenger.”In addition to the world’s busiest airports, fast-developing air transportation markets are also positioned to benefit from the A380. Airbus’ Executive Vice President of Marketing and Strategy Kiran Rao cites the example of India, with an emerging middle class that is expected to exceed 400 million people in the coming years. “The only way to move all those passengers around is on a large aircraft and you have to do so with economic efficiency and with comfort, and the A380 is the solution.”"
Alcoa to Supply 3D-Printed Metal Parts for Airbus Aircraft - Business Wire,"Thu, 07 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMTYwNDA3MDA1NzU1L2VuL0FsY29hLXRvLVN1cHBseS0zRC1QcmludGVkLU1ldGFsLVBhcnRzLWZvci1BaXJidXMtQWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lightweight metals leader Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has entered into an agreement with Airbus to supply 3D-printed titanium fuselage and engine pylon components for Airbus commercial aircraft. Alcoa expects to deliver the first additive manufactured parts to Airbus in mid-2016.

“We are proud to partner with Airbus to help pave the way to the future of aerospace development and manufacturing,” said Alcoa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld. “The unique combination of our multi-material alloy development expertise, powder production capabilities, aerospace manufacturing strength and product qualification know-how position us to lead in this exciting, emerging space.”

Airbus chose to work with Alcoa because of its comprehensive capabilities, from materials science leadership to additive manufacturing and aerospace parts qualification. The agreement will draw on Alcoa’s decades of aerospace experience and new technologies gained through the recent acquisition of RTI and organic expansion in Whitehall, Michigan. Alcoa also recently invested in 3D-printing and metallic powder production capabilities at its technical center outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Last year, Alcoa acquired RTI International Metals (RTI)—now known as Alcoa Titanium & Engineered Products (ATEP)—which grew Alcoa’s additive manufacturing capabilities to include 3D-printed titanium and specialty metals parts produced at ATEP’s Austin, Texas facility. The Airbus agreement will draw on these capabilities as well as ATEP’s titanium ingot melting and billetizing, machining, finishing and inspection technologies.

Alcoa will employ advanced CT scan and Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) capabilities at its advanced aerospace facility in Whitehall, Michigan. HIP is a technology that strengthens the metallic structures of traditional and additive manufactured parts made of titanium and nickel based superalloys. Through a $22 million investment in the technology in Whitehall, Michigan, Alcoa today owns and operates one of the largest aerospace HIP technology complexes in the world.

Additionally, Alcoa is bolstering its additive manufacturing capabilities through a $60 million expansion in advanced 3D-printing materials and processes, including metallic powders. The expansion is located at the Alcoa Technical Center near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the world’s largest light metals research center.

Details of this agreement with Airbus were not disclosed.

Emirates orders two additional Airbus A380 aircraft - Aviation24.be,"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlybGluZS9lbWlyYXRlcy1vcmRlcnMtdHdvLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXZpYXRpb24yNC5iZS9haXJsaW5lcy9lbWlyYXRlcy1haXJsaW5lL2VtaXJhdGVzLW9yZGVycy10d28tYWRkaXRpb25hbC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1haXJjcmFmdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates today announced it has placed an order with manufacturer Airbus for an additional two new A380 aircraft, to be delivered in the 4th quarter of 2017.

Emirates already operates the world’s largest fleet of Airbus A380s, with 75 in service and a further 65 on firm order. The additional two aircraft, to be powered by Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines will take Emirates’ total A380 order book to 142.

Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said: “From now until the end of 2017, Emirates will retire 30 older aircraft from our fleet. At the same time, to meet our growth expectations, we will receive delivery of 24 new Boeing 777, and 33 new A380 aircraft including these two additional A380 aircraft just ordered. This is in line with our strategy to operate a modern and efficient fleet and offer the best possible experience for our customers.”

He added: “We’ve always been open about how the A380 has been a big success for Emirates. It’s a boon for our operations to slot constrained airports and we get a lot of positive feedback from our customers. In fact, demand from customers for our A380 product is growing, as we expand our A380 network and more travellers have had the opportunity to experience it first-hand.”

The two new aircraft will be in two-class configuration and feature Emirates’ industry-leading products including, the iconic Onboard Lounge where Business Class passengers can socialise at 40,000 feet, Emirates’ award-winning inflight entertainment ice with over 2,500 channels and free Wi-Fi.

Prague, Taipei and Vienna will soon become destinations on the Emirates route network served by Emirates A380s, after which the airline will have 42 destinations across the globe served by its flagship A380 aircraft.

Airbus estimates that Emirates’ A380 orders support the employment of 41,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs in Europe. About 70% of these jobs are split equally between France and Germany, with the UK having 17% and the remaining 5,000 jobs in Spain. These are high-skilled jobs and impact a high-value supply chain, creating a significant multiplier effect in the countries where Airbus has aircraft production facilities.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany have joined Britain in suspending export credit facilities for Airbus jet deliveries, expanding the fallout from a potential corruption probe in Britain, several people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The move follows Britain's decision last week to suspend financing and alert the Serious Fraud Office after Airbus Group said it had found anomalies over the declaration of overseas agents and that it had itself notified the UK authorities.

Unusually, it leaves the world's two largest planemakers, Airbus and Boeing , both facing paralysis over government export financing as Congressional delays leave U.S. Export Import bank unable to support Airbus's U.S. rival.

In Europe, Airbus draws on financing support for some sales from Britain, France and Germany where its main factories are.

The nations typically act in concert, offering guarantees in proportion to the industrial work in each country, but declining to take up the slack whenever one of them refuses to take part.

A German economy ministry spokesman confirmed that the financing, provided on its behalf by Allianz unit Euler-Hermes, was no longer available.

Berlin is also examining whether the UK episode could have consequences for export credits already awarded, he added.

In France, three sources said export guarantees were being withheld for the time being.

""Audits are being carried out in the UK and we are waiting for the conclusions for those,"" a French government official said.

Related stories

Airbus Group declined to add to a previous statement that it was co-operating with export credit agencies and that it expected financing to be resumed in the near future.

For now, the market impact is seen as limited as the use of export credits has dwindled to around 6 percent of deliveries from 40 percent at the height of the 2008-10 financial crisis.

But the unprecedented halt raises doubt over the financing for some upcoming deliveries, pushing up demand for commercial loans and placing pressure on Airbus to offer bridge financing.

""The problem is that deals financed with export credit are usually the tough-to-finance ones, so finding a commercial alternative is not always that simple,"" a market source said.

AGENT FEES AND NAMES

The agency which underwrites aircraft exports in Britain has said it will not support Airbus deliveries until it gets assurances about Airbus's current practices on overseas agents.

The UK case involves discrepancies over the amount of agents' fees disclosed in applications for export support, or missing names of third parties, in some cases dating back several years, two people familiar with the matter said.

A person responsible for overseeing some of the information supplied in export credit applications is no longer with the group, people familiar with the matter said. Airbus Group declined comment.

The decision by Airbus to report itself reflects efforts by many aerospace companies to toughen compliance and review their records for past failings after a series of industry scandals.

In its just-published annual report, Airbus said a newly centralized compliance team was revising the procedures on hiring consultants and warned investors this may ""lead to additional commercial disputes or other consequences"".

Europe's largest aerospace group says it is co-operating with four existing criminal probes into suspected irregularities in defense or security markets, including a British investigation into a $3.3 billion communications deal with Saudi Arabia and a German probe into the sale of fighter jets to Austria.

With all of this 3D printing, the defense giant is going to need more 3D printing facilities, which is why they’ve just opened a 3D printing center in Germany with the Ludwig Bolköw Campus.

The center is an extension of Airbus Group’s R&D facilities in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen. The Aerospace Factory, as the new 3D printing center at the facility is being called, will be based out of the Ludwig Bolköw Campus, an industry and university collaborative venture located on-site. The location will be used to research the 3D printing of endparts for use in aerospace through work performed by a number of important players including: Airbus Safran Launchers; metal 3D printer manufacturer EOS; engine maker MTU Aero Engines; the Technical University of Munich and its Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management; Airbus Group Innovations; the Fraunhofer Development Center for X-ray Technology (EZRT); Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG); Airbus subsidiary APWorks; virtual prototyping firm the ESI Group; and the Airbus Endowed Chair for Integrative Simulation and Engineering of Materials and Processes (ISEMP) of the University of Bremen.

The news came yesterday as Aerospace Group inaugurated a new material research lab and broke ground for their E-Aircraft System House, which sees Airbus partnering with Siemens to explore electric flight. The materials lab is focused on creating lightweight, environmentally friendly materials. Staffed by 65 experts, the lab will explore such technologies as 3D printing and welding. The E-Aircraft System House will, when opened in 2018, will see the defense manufacturer work to create electric and hybrid aircraft engines to help reduce CO2 emissions in aerospace.

As exciting as the new 3D printing center is, I’m more interested in the E-Aircraft System House. Worldwide government agreements to cut CO2 emissions seem to be at least driving large manufacturers like Airbus to make the needed shift to clean fuel. I hope that they’re able to do so before it’s too late!"

BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Airbus Group and Local Motors have launched a global co-creation challenge to identify the next generation of commercial drone technology. The two companies are inviting amateurs and professionals alike into a joint project that includes a series of co-creation activities, online competitions, open-source projects and hackathons all focused on designing a next-generation commercial drone solution.

The first part of the Airbus Cargo Drone Challenge, which launched today, seeks specifically to identify designs for drone aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and efficient forward flight. The challenge is taking place on Local Motors’ innovative co-creation platform, and the full details and technical specifications of the challenge can be found here.

Part of the inspiration behind this challenge is to identify better ways to transport medical supplies when time is of the essence and a life could be hanging in the balance. Imagine a doctor deep in the jungle having the ability to order urgently needed drugs from a hospital 100km away.

“As Local Motors and Airbus Group progress in this challenge, we expect our co-creation community to deliver the kind of amazing ideas that helped us build the world’s first co-created vehicle and 3D-printed car,” said Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers. “As we harness the power of the crowd, Airbus will have the ability to iterate on commercial drones faster than ever before. This will be a much-needed shot in the arm for civil drone development.”

This initial co-creation challenge will run through June 5 and offer $117,500 in total prize money. The evaluation of each entry will be conducted through a jury of experts in the field before potentially becoming part of an industrial program from Airbus.

“The Challenge initiative is really exciting and we are eager to see how the power of co-creation can accelerate new, innovative thinking around commercial drones,” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems within Airbus Group.

Assisting Local Motors and Airbus Group on this challenge is Praxis Aerospace Concepts International Inc. (PACI), which will bring its deep, technological experience in commercialization of robotics and unmanned systems to the project.

"TAP Portugal to launch A330neo, Airspace and new Recaro biz seat - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 06 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDQvdGFwLXBvcnR1Z2FsLWxhdW5jaC1hMzMwbmVvLWFpcnNwYWNlLWFpcmJ1cy1uZXctcmVjYXJvLWJ1c2luZXNzLXNlYXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG — TAP Portugal’s new management has wasted no time in ordering new hard product to turn the oft-derided former state-owned airline around.

TAP is to be the launch partner for not only the Airbus A330neo, of which it will take fourteen A330-900neo examples, but also for the Airspace by Airbus cabin system on display at the Aircraft Interiors Expo this week. Indeed, it was hard to choose whether Airbus SVP of Marketing François Caudron or TAP CCO Trey Urbahn was more excited about in the announcement.

“We are extremely proud to be the first airline to fly the Airspace by Airbus cabin in the new A330neo,” Urbahn said. “Our passengers and flight crews eagerly look forward to experiencing this innovative new cabin design. Furthermore, the Airspace cabin represents an exciting and flexible canvas onto which we can project the TAP brand.”

Airspace innovations that Airbus is promising for TAP include a new welcome zone, full mood lighting with 16.7 million colour variations, larger overhead bins, new lavatories, and latest inflight entertainment and connectivity options.

On board its aircraft, which will be delivered from July 2017, TAP will offer a 2.5 class layout, and every passenger seat on the aircraft will be from Recaro, an order which comprises over four thousand business and economy class seats as the seatmaker pushes into the business class market.

“We are delighted with TAP’s decision to equip its entire cabin with our new CL3710 and CL6710 seats. It clearly reflects the strength of a successful collaboration between two powerful brands in the industry,” Recaro CEO Mark Hiller said in Hamburg.

Regular economy class seats down the back, an extra-legroom economy section in the middle, and a fully flat bed with direct aisle access for every passenger in business class.

For that seat — Recaro’s CL6710 — TAP will also be the Airbus launch customer. The CL6710 is Recaro’s first foray into longhaul business class, and the seatmaker is demonstrating an enhanced, more immersive seat experience at AIX this week.

Having an established seatmaker offering additional options in business class is a significant boost to the industry’s product diversity, particularly given certification and production delays from both B/E Aerospace and Zodiac.

In responses to RGN at its press event at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, TAP Chief Commercial Officer Trey Urbahn also outlined its plans for both refitting its existing Airbus A330-200 aircraft, but also noted that with fuel prices as low as they are it is intending to extend the life of its venerable Airbus A340-300 jets, which are over twenty years old.

Urbahn explained that TAP will refit its A330-200 with Thompson Vantage seats in a staggered layout, but that it will not be using the wider Vantage XL seat seen on Qantas. This means that two out of the nine seats in each pair of rows will either need to climb over the aisle seat passenger or be climbed over.

RGN also understands that TAP intends to leave the existing Sogerma (now Stelia) Solstys staggered seats (which do have direct aisle access for every passenger) on incoming ex-Azul Airbus A330 aircraft.

In addition to a densification of its economy class cabins on the shorthaul Airbus A320 family — to have a knee-crunchingly tight 28” pitch down back and a 33” up front in Eurobusiness and “premium” economy seating — TAP is also promising flat bed seats on the Airbus A321neoLR aircraft it has on order. These aircraft, Urbahn suggested, will open up numerous transatlantic options for Western Europe’s most westerly hubbed airline.

TAP has contracted with Airbus to carry out its fleet renovations for both the seven A330 and forty-one A320 family aircraft. TAP will perform the modifications in its maintenance and engineering facilities, while Airbus will be in charge of the engineering and certification processes. “The fleet cabin renewal program is planned to start in the 3rd quarter of 2016 for the A320 Family fleet and in the 1st quarter 2017 for the A330ceo fleet,” Airbus said today.

From the sounds of things, we are looking at an airline hoping to replicate the success of Aer Lingus (and, to an extent, Icelandair) in developing a geographical gift into a strategic position in the west of Europe.

Overall, the balance of decisions announced today (and recently, like the hourly shuttle on ATR72 aircraft between Lisbon and second city Porto) suggest that the team running TAP has a firm plan to improve matters at the airline. The rather battered brand needs it, with its reputation for problematic #PaxEx responses to operational changes (particularly during irregularities).

RGN looks forward to discussing the plans from TAP’s new management to turn the airline’s operations around equally as laudably."
Looking at the Airspace by Airbus A330neo cabin.... - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Tue, 05 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNi8wNC8wNS9sb29raW5nLWF0LXRoZS1haXJzcGFjZS1ieS1haXJidXMtY2FiaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus revealed the mockup of its A330neo cabin today – branded as “Airspace by Airbus”.

Airbus it seems are continuing to innovate in the cabin space by making it a lot more friendly than cabin have been in the past – and to create a signature brand for the cabins that are upcoming for the A330neo series aircraft.

So what doers the cabin look like? I’m at Aircraft Interiors Expo to find out!

We’re looking at a the cabin from a forward view. Here we can see the Business class cabin – with overhead bins to the site of the plane and not in the middle – creating a very airy atmosphere.

In the business class cabin, we have a layout of 1-2-1. It’s amazing how much space is opened up with the removal of the overhead bins.

Transitioning in Premium Economy zone, you can see lighting design and effort gone in… as well as the appearance of overhead bins.

So what’s next – a Premium economy section. This is shown off in a 2-3-2 layout

Again, these are picture to about 40″ pitch, and a larger seatpan.

Going through the plane, Pivot bins don’t feature – rather current shelf style bins are more the order of the day.

Even the toilet modules are being re–designed with redesigned with more touch free elements and antibacterial coatings being used. Discussing it with colleages – its a rather small unit and could be used in an economy/premium economy cabin.

Finally, we move onto the Economy Cabin. In the mock-up, it’s the usual Airbus 2-4-2 configuration that flies aboard the A330 at the moment. In this mockup, seats are pitched at 32″, with a seat-width of 18″ – making it a rather comfortable place to be.

And maybe more importantly, the seats in economy aren’t pushed against the wall (unlike the A380 11 across concept shown last year).

First impressions count – its clear Airbus thinks the same thing with this rollout.

But who will launch the A330neo Airspace by Airbus cabin? We’ll find out tomorrow!

Airbus A350 Update: Which Airlines Are Flying Which Routes - The Points Guy,"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzA0L3doaWNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFyZS1mbHlpbmctd2hpY2gtcm91dGVzLW9uLXRoZS1uZXctYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since Qatar Airways became the launch customer of Airbus's next-generation A350 at the end of 2014, several other airlines have taken delivery of the jet. Today, TPG Special Contributor Eric Rosen gives us a status update on orders and deliveries of the new aircraft — and how you can get aboard.

Meant to compete with Boeing's next-generation 787 Dreamliner, the A350 is Airbus's successor to its long-haul A330 and A340 aircraft — as Airbus delivers more of these to its airline customers, travelers around the world are going to get more chances to experience them. Here's a look at which airlines already have the new jets and where they are flying them.

Just a few notes before we get started: I found current route information on AirportSpotting and RoutesOnline, and corroborated them with news releases directly from the individual airlines and by searching the airlines' websites for available flights. While the information below is current as of this writing, airline routes and schedules change all the time, so if you do book any of these, check and double-check the aircraft to make sure you'll actually fly an A350 on your dates.

The Plane and Specifications

There are actually three versions of the A350 — the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000 — however, the main version with the most orders by far is the A350-900. Depending on the model and configuration, the aircraft can seat between 250-440 passengers (Airbus is touting standard economy seating with 18 inches of width per seat).

Airbus claims that the jet is up to 25% more fuel efficient compared to its aluminum long-range competitors and can perform flights up to 19 hours. Among the interior-design elements flyers should appreciate are straighter side walls, smoother curves and larger windows and mood lighting, all designed to lessen the impact of flight on the body.

The A350-800 is the smallest of the three at just 60.54 meters long, with a wingspan of 64.75 meters and a range of up to 8,200 nautical miles. It can seat up to 280 passengers in a typical three-class configuration.

The A350-900 seats up to 325 passengers in a typical three-class configuration and can fly up to 8,100 nautical miles. It is 66.89 meters long with the same wingspan. There's also an Ultra Long Range (ULR) variant, which Singapore plans to use on its US nonstops.

The largest of the three, the A350-1000, can seat up to 366 flyers in a typical three-class configuration. It's 73.88 meters long and has the same wingspan of 64.75 meters, with a range of up to 7,900 nautical miles.

Orders and Customers

According to Airbus, the company has received the following order numbers:

A350-800: 16

16 A350-900: 580

580 A350-1000: 181

Total: 777 orders (oddly enough) by 41 customers.

Just for a quick contrast, Boeing says it has a total of 1,143 orders for the Dreamliner. Here's a table with the current A350 order (not delivery) totals:

Current Airlines and Routes

Though we're sure to see many more of these aircraft in the skies in the coming years — especially since many of the deliveries are slated for 2017-2018 — according to the latest figures from Airbus, just 16 A350s have been delivered so far, including five to private leasing companies and one to an undisclosed party. Just one has begun in 2016 so far, though more are coming off the line soon. Here's who's flying the new aircraft (or will be soon), and where you can take it in the next few months.

CATHAY PACIFIC

Cathay Pacific should be getting its first A350 next month. Image courtesy of Airbus.

The Hong Kong-based carrier was supposed to receive its first A350-900s earlier this year, but delivery has been delayed until May. Cathay's A350-900s will have 38 business-class seats in what has become the airline's signature reverse-herringbone 1-2-1 configuration with premium economy in a 2-4-2 configuration.

The business-class seats on Cathay's A350s will be a refreshed version of its current business-class seats, pictured here.

Cathay Pacific plans to use the new A350s on routes within Asia first, including one-month stints from Hong Kong to Manila and Taipei in June and regularly to Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore starting in July.

The carrier will use the new aircraft on long-haul routes from Hong Kong to Düsseldorf starting September 1 (CX 379 on the outbound and CX 376 on the return) and to London-Gatwick starting September 2 (CX 349 on the outbound and CX 344 on the return) — I am finding award availability on those routes starting in October, though. Cathay Pacific has also indicated it would put an A350 into service on its route from Hong Kong to Auckland closer to the end of the year — I'm still not seeing it in the schedule through December/January, so I wouldn't try to book it just yet.

You can already find availability on the HKG-LGW route using BritishAirways.com.

If you want to use miles to fly the new jet, American Airlines would require 35,000 AAdvantage miles each way in economy or 75,000 each way in business class from Asia 2 to Europe on one of those routes to London or Düsseldorf.

FINNAIR

Finnair was the first European carrier to get the new jet. Image courtesy of Airbus.

So far, this Nordic Oneworld member has taken delivery of three of its total order of 19 A350s. Finnair currently flies it from its hub in Helsinki to Beijing (though this looks like it's being serviced by another aircraft until May 9), Hong Kong, London and Shanghai. It also plans to use the aircraft on a route to Singapore beginning in October and Ho Chi Minh starting in November.

The interior of Finnair's new A350 business-class cabin.

Finnair's A350s have 297 seats in three classes. The business-class cabin has 46 seats in a 1-2-1 reverse-herringbone layout with fully lie-flat beds. Premium economy has just 43 seats while economy has 208 seats — both are in a 3-3-3 configuration.

If you want to book that Helsinki-Beijing route using your American AAdvantage miles, each way in economy will cost you 35,000 miles plus $17 in taxes and fees, while business class would require 75,000 miles each way and the same amount of taxes and fees. What's interesting is that British Airways would charge you just 20,000 Avios and $159 from Helsinki-Beijing in economy or 60,000 Avios in business class with about the same taxes and fees.

Finnair's premium economy seats.

Just a note: While searching for awards on AA.com to verify these flights, I noticed that there seems to be a lot of business-class availability in the award calendar, but when you actually select the Finnair flight you want, the page refreshes with just British Airways flights displayed. When I called to check on a few of the dates where this had happened, the American AAdvantage reps could not see the Finnair award space that I had initially found, so I am guessing that there's a glitch with the AAdvantage award search and it's displaying phantom space.

LATAM

TAM will be putting its A350s into service from Sao Paulo to Miami and Madrid. Image courtesy of Airbus.

South America's largest carrier took delivery of the first of 27 A350s it has on order back in December 2015. The A350s are actually for the TAM part of LATAM, so you'll find them mostly on the carrier's Brazil routes.

TAM's A350s will have the same business-class seats as its Boeing 787s (pictured here). Image courtesy of LATAM.

TAM's A350s have a total of 348 seats — 30 in the airline's Premium Business class and 318 in economy — and the cabins look much like LAN's 787s, with the front-facing lie-flat business-class seats in a 2-2-2 configuration, and economy seats in a 3-3-3 layout.

After flying it domestically within Brazil, the airline put the new jet into service on its routes from São Paulo to Miami (as of March 17) and will add it to its São Paulo-Madrid route starting May 2.

LATAM's A350 economy cabin. Image courtesy of LATAM.

If you want to fly the São Paulo-Miami route, your best bet is using American AAdvantage miles: 30,000 each way in economy or 57,500 in business. That São Paulo-Madrid flight will cost you 50,000 miles each way in economy or 87,500 in business.

QATAR AIRWAYS

Qatar flies its A350s to New York (JFK) and Philadelphia. Image courtesy of Qatar Airways.

This A350 launch customer has a total of 80 A350s on order and has taken delivery of seven of them so far, making it the largest operator of the new aircraft at the moment. TPG Editor-in-Chief Zach Honig had the chance to fly it (despite a mishap) back in December, and was pretty impressed.

The business-class cabin has 36 seats configured in a reverse-herringbone 1-2-1 layout, while the economy cabin has 247 seats in a 3-3-3 layout.

Looking over the business-class cabin of Qatar's A350.

Flyers looking to experience Qatar's new planes are spoiled for choice, since the carrier operates them on a variety of long- and short-haul routes from its hub in Doha to Adelaide (beginning in May), Boston, Dubai, Frankfurt (this was the original route), Munich, New York (JFK), Philadelphia and Singapore.

Another shot of Qatar's A350 business-class cabin.

Qatar is part of Oneworld, so you'll probably want to redeem American AAdvantage miles. Flights from the US to Doha will run you 40,000 AAdvantage miles each way in economy or 70,000 each way in business class. One-way flights from Doha to Europe are a bit more reasonable at 20,000 miles in economy or 42,500 miles in business, while flying one-way from Doha to Singapore will cost you 25,000 miles in economy or 40,000 miles in business class — a relative bargain.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES

Singapore just got its first A350 last month. Image courtesy of Singapore Airlines.

This Southeast Asian carrier and Star Alliance member has ordered a total of 67 A350-900s, making it the largest customer for that particular model — it just took delivery of the first of them at the beginning of March.

Singapore's A350 has 253 seats total, with 42 in business class, 24 in premium economy and 187 in economy. The plane has the airline's newest business-class product, configured in a 1-2-1 layout, while premium economy is 2-4-2 and economy is 3-3-3.

The new A350s will feature Singapore Airlines' new business-class seats. Image courtesy of Singapore Airlines.

The carrier plans to fly its new jets on routes around Asia for the first few months, with its first long-haul flight scheduled to be from Singapore-Amsterdam on May 9, after which point it will take over the airline's daily service on this route. The airline also plans to launch a nonstop flight from Singapore-Düsseldorf three times weekly starting July 21, which will also be serviced by the new aircraft.

Singapore's A350s will have its new premium economy seats.

Singapore Airlines appears to be operating one of these aircraft on certain flights (not every day) between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (SQ 118 and SQ 119) through the beginning of May. It looks like the carrier will be moving that aircraft to its Singapore-Jakarta flight as of May 10.

Availability on the Amsterdam route is limited to waitlisted awards for the first few weeks, but I did find one available in economy on May 17:

It'll cost you 29,750 Singapore KrisFlyer miles and SG$245.60 ($182 USD) for an economy award. To be honest, I searched through several months of dates and I still couldn't find a saver-level business-class award for this route. But if Singapore Airlines starts loading them into the award inventory, it should cost you about 51,000 miles and the same amount in taxes and fees.

By contrast, United would charge you 55,000 MileagePlus miles each way in economy and 85,00 each way for business class. If you have Aeroplan miles, you'll need 40,000 each way for economy or 75,000 each way for business class.

Remember that Singapore KrisFlyer is also a 1:1 transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, so you have lots of options to top up your KrisFlyer account.

THAI AIRWAYS

THAI Airways will be getting four A350s. Image courtesy of Airbus.

Thailand's flagship carrier has a total order of 12 A350s (four are direct from Airbus and 8 will be leased), and should be taking delivery of the first of them in the next few months. Interestingly, the airline seems to have deferred delivery of the leased ones until 2018, so we might not see them flying anytime soon.

The planes the airline still plans to take will carry just 321 passengers, with 289 in economy and 32 in business class. There are no images yet of the interior, but chances are it will look something like the airline's 787s — that means flyers can expect a configuration of 2-2-2 lie-flat seats in business class, and a 3-3-3 layout in economy.

The airline plans to start flying one of its three daily frequencies from Bangkok to Melbourne with the new aircraft starting July 1 (it's the overnight flight on the outbound, returning in the afternoon, if you're interested), with a second daily flight on this route by the new aircraft scheduled to begin August 1.

For now, it looks like the new A350 services (both the first one in July and the second one in August) are loaded into the schedule and I was even able to find lots of award availability both in economy and business class on United.com. Awards between Southeast Asia and Australia were one of the silver linings to United's massive award-chart devaluation back in 2014, with redemption levels actually going down between these two regions.

Plenty of award availability on THAI's A350 route from Bangkok to Melbourne.

As you can see from the screenshot above, it'll cost you 17,500 United MileagePlus miles each way in economy or just 30,000 in business class to fly the new aircraft on this route, plus about $36 in taxes and fees.

VIETNAM AIRLINES

Vietnam Airlines flies the jet from Hanoi to Paris and Incheon.

Vietnam Airlines, a member of SkyTeam, has ordered 10 A350s directly from Airbus and also plans to lease four more — its first A350 was leased from AerCap and went into service back in July 2015. TPG actually got a chance to fly it from Paris-Hanoi late last year.

TPG flew Vietnam's A350 from Paris to Hanoi back in December.

Vietnam Airlines' aircraft has 29 business-class seats in a staggered 1-2-1 configuration, 45 seats in premium economy in a 3-3-3 layout, and 231 economy seats in a 3-3-3 pattern.

The airline uses its A350s on routes from Hanoi to Paris and Seoul-Incheon (ICN).

The premium economy cabin on Vietnam Airlines' A350.

If you wanted to fly the Paris-Hanoi route, you could use either Delta miles or Flying Blue (Air France/KLM) miles since both programs are 1:1 transfer partners of both American Express Membership Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, while Flying Blue is also a 1:1 transfer partner of Citi ThankYou Rewards. Flying Blue would charge you 40,000 miles each way in economy or 100,000 miles each way in business class, while Delta would require 50,000 miles each way in economy or 80,000 each way in business class.

You can use Delta miles to book an award on Vietnam Airlines' A350 flights.

If you wanted to fly the Hanoi-Incheon route, you would need 22,500 Delta miles each way in economy or 40,000 miles each way in business class. Flying Blue would charge you 20,000 miles each way in economy or 50,000 each way in business class.

Drone may have hit plane landing at Heathrow Airport - USA TODAY,"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMDQvMTgvYnJpdGlzaC1haXJ3YXlzLXBsYW5lLWRyb25lLWhlYXRocm93LWFpcnBvcnQvODMxNzkyMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Drone may have hit plane landing at Heathrow Airport

There have been sightings and near-misses, but on Sunday the pilot of a British Airways plane reported that a drone may have struck an Airbus A320 as it was landing at London’s Heathrow airport.

The incident is under investigation by Metropolitan Police based at Heathrow Airport, but if confirmed, this may be the first official case of a plane of a major airline getting hit by a drone.

The British Airways flight was arriving in London from Geneva at 12:50 p.m. local time on Sunday with 132 passengers and five crew on board and, after landing the plane safely, the pilot reported that an object — apparently a unmanned drone — had struck the front of the plane, the BCC reported.

British Airways is assisting the police with an investigation of the incident.

""Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight,” a British Airways spokesman said.

The British Airline Pilots Association is alarmed, but not surprised, by this incident.

""Frankly it was only a matter of time before we had a drone strike given the huge numbers being flown around by amateurs who don't understand the risks and the rules,” Steve Landells, flight safety specialist for the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), said in a statement to the Telegraph and others. He added that while most drones are flown safely and sensibly, “much more education of drone users and enforcement of the rules is needed to ensure our skies remain safe from this threat.”

The apparent drone hit comes amid quadrupling of near-misses involving drones and aircraft in the United Kingdom in recent months, the Telegraph reports, and in drone incidents around the world.

In February 2016, Tony Tyler, director general of the International Air Transport Association, called for drone regulations to be put in place worldwide.

""I am as excited as you are about the prospect of having pizza delivered by a drone,"" he told a conference in Singapore, ""but we cannot allow [drones] to be a hindrance or safety threat to commercial aviation,"" the BBC reported.

Prior to this weekend’s event, there were a handful of incidents involving drones at Heathrow Airport, including an incident in early January 2016 when a flight was delayed for a short while on a Saturday afternoon when a drone officials suspected to be a Christmas present was flown over one of the airport’s runways.

TAP Portugal to Launch the Airbus A330neo with Airspace Interior - AirlineGeeks.com,"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA0LzEwL3RhcC1wb3J0dWdhbC10by1sYXVuY2gtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwbmVvLXdpdGgtYWlyc3BhY2UtaW50ZXJpb3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Airlines ] By AirlineGeeks.com Staff

By signing an agreement with Airbus to be the first operator of the new A330neo, TAP Portugal has also become the launch carrier to fly the Airspace cabin brand by Airbus. In 2015, the airline placed a large fleet renewal contract with Airbus which included an order for 14 A330-900neo’s. Passengers will soon be able to experience the Airspace cabin interiors for the first time when these aircraft enter service around the end of 2017.

Trey Urbahn, Chief Commercial Officer at TAP Portugal said, “We are extremely proud to be the first airline to fly the Airspace by Airbus cabin in the new A330neo. Our passengers and flight-crews eagerly look forward to experiencing this innovative new cabin design. Furthermore, the Airspace cabin represents an exciting and flexible canvas onto which we can project the TAP brand.”

François Caudron, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Airbus said, “We are delighted to confirm that TAP will become the first airline to introduce the Airspace by Airbus cabin in the A330neo. Developed with passengers at heart and airlines in mind, Airspace encompasses four pillars: Comfort, Ambience, Services and Design and will ensure that Airbus cabins continue to be the benchmark in passenger experience and airline value.”

The Airspace cabin interior, launched by Airbus earlier this year, connects the wellbeing for passengers with the operational performance for its airline customers. Representing the best of Airbus’ cabin innovation and design, Airspace will offer a sophisticated, flexible canvas as a back-drop to enhance the airlines’ own brands.

Dr. Kiran Rao, Airbus’ Executive Vice President of Strategy and Marketing commented: “Airbus’ history of success is down to innovation – which has always included the cabin as a key driver. With the great passenger feedback on the A350 XWB, and our application of A350 cabin technology and features to the A330neo, we are proud to embrace our cabin design principles through our new brand – Airspace by Airbus.”

Highlights of TAP’s Airspace cabin will include a new welcome area, the latest mood LED-based lighting system with 16.7 million possible colour variations, larger overhead bins, new contemporary lavatories, and the latest-generation in-flight entertainment (IFE) and connectivity. The Airspace cabin ambience ensures passengers’ wellbeing, while the signature details and iconic elements will be recognizable throughout the cabin.

OneWeb Satellites Completes Its Industrial Organisation - Space Ref,"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2Uvb25ld2ViLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtY29tcGxldGVzLWl0cy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLW9yZ2FuaXNhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture between Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb, has chosen Florida in the United States as the site for its final assembly line, completing the last step in its industrial organisation. This facility, located at Florida’s Exploration Park, near the Kennedy Space Center, will carry out the series production of nearly 900 satellites for the OneWeb constellation.

“In June 2015, we started from scratch to create a new satellite design and manufacturing company,” stated François Auque, Head of Space Systems. “In both Florida and Europe, we are now embarking on the next stage of an unprecedented venture in the space industry: a site that can mass-produce dozens of satellites every month. All this, of course, without affecting the levels of quality and technology that are essential when it comes to spacecraft – complex machines that need to operate for several years in space.”

The choice of Florida for the final assembly line follows the announcement of the creation of OneWeb Satellites in January 2016. The production site will cover an area of 100,000+ square feet and will create nearly 250 direct jobs.

A prototype production line at Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse (France) will assemble and test the first 10 satellites, and check and validate industrial solutions for the series production. The design of the satellites is currently under way in the company’s design offices in Toulouse.

The space segment of OneWeb will comprise initially a constellation of 648 operational satellites and replacement satellites, all of which will be identical. Each satellite will weigh approximately 150 kg and will operate in low Earth orbit. Arianespace and Virgin Galactic will begin launching the spacecraft in 2018 and the satellites will be placed in orbit using electrical propulsion.

This joint venture, equally owned by Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb, has been set up following the selection in June 2015 of Airbus Defence and Space as the industrial partner of OneWeb to design and build its satellites. The constellation to be operated by OneWeb will provide high-speed internet services with global coverage. OneWeb Satellites will also be able to produce satellites, platforms or equipment to be marketed by Airbus Defence and Space for the benefit of other operators of future constellations.

High-tech lifter: Will the H215 bring utility helicopter operations into the 21st century? - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2hpZ2gtdGVjaC1saWZ0ZXItbmV3LWgyMTUtaW50cm9kdWNlZC1pbi11dGlsaXR5LW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H215 combines the advanced avionics and digital autopilot of the H225 with the proven AS332 airframe, providing a unique combination of capabilities for the utility market. Photos by Skip Robinson

Broadly speaking, there are two things that utility helicopter operators care about in an aircraft: performance and cost. In an industry built on lifting things, what matters most is how much you can lift, and how economically. Sure, modern technology is nice, but it’s usually expensive, and not strictly necessary for visual flight rules (VFR) pursuits like setting air conditioners or dropping water on fires. That’s why the medium- and heavy-lift construction and firefighting industries are dominated by helicopter models that have been flying since the 1960s — including, in North America, the Bell 205 and 212, the Sikorsky S-61 and S-64, and the Boeing-Vertol Model 107 and 234. Now, Airbus Helicopters is promoting a new aircraft for this utility market, the H215. Well, a relatively new aircraft, anyway. Despite the unfamiliar name — the result of Airbus Helicopters’ wholesale rebranding of its product line in 2015 — the H215 is simply the latest incarnation of the Aérospatiale AS332 Super Puma, itself a derivation of the ’60s-era SA330 Puma. And, from the outside and the cabin, the H215 is recognizably an AS332, with the same tall, sturdy airframe; four-bladed main rotor system; and two Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines as the AS332 C1 or L1. The cockpit is where the H215 is “new,” and in a big way. Here, the AS332’s traditional steam gauges have been replaced by gleaming glass panels, including four LCD multi-function displays, and two color vehicle management system displays. Even more significantly, the automatic flight control system (AFCS) has been upgraded to a four-axis dual duplex digital autopilot, fully integrated with the avionics. It’s the same AFCS found in Airbus Helicopters’ offshore workhorse, the H225 (formerly EC225). As such, it’s capable of the most sophisticated instrument flight rules (IFR) procedures and search-and-rescue patterns you can throw at it. Previously known as the AS332 C1e/L1e, the H215 made its debut at HAI Heli-Expo 2014 in Anaheim, Calif., in the form of the short-frame AS332 C1e. At this year’s Heli-Expo in Louisville, Kentucky, that short-frame “aerial work” version was back, and it embarked on a North American demonstration tour immediately following the show. Along with some prospective customers, I had the chance to take it for a test flight before it left Louisville. The experience was the highlight of my Heli-Expo week.

Airbus showed off the H215 to a range of private and government customers during the aircraft’s latest U.S. demo tour.

My 40 minutes of stick time convinced me that the H215 is a phenomenally capable aircraft, with new-generation technologies that genuinely enhance safety and situational awareness. But in a sector of the helicopter industry where technological progress has traditionally been a low priority, will utility operators and their customers decide that the H215’s capabilities are worth the cost? That’s the $16 million question.Running the numbers First, some facts and figures. Both versions of the H215 — the short-frame aerial work version, and the long-frame “multi-role” version — have the same maximum gross weight of 18,960 pounds (8,600 kilograms), or 20,615 lb. (9,350 kg) in an external load configuration. The respective basic empty weights of the aerial work and multi-role aircraft are 10,060 lb. (4,563 kg) and 10,373 lb. (4,705 kg), so both versions offer a substantial useful load. And the H215 is clearly a serious lifter, with a maximum cargo hook weight of 9,920 lb. (4,500 kg). That gives it an edge over the similarly sized Sikorsky S-61N, which is one of the models that Airbus Helicopters thinks it can replace. Of course, this performance degrades with altitude, but according to the limited performance charts I obtained from Airbus, at 5,000 feet pressure altitude and 25 C (77 F), the aerial work version of the H215 should still have a useful load in hover out of ground effect (HOGE) of around 8,150 lb. (3,700 kg). So, the short answer to “How much can the H215 lift?” is, “A good amount.”

Even for pilots unfamiliar with the aircraft, the H215’s glass cockpit displays are clear and easy to interpret.

Although the H215 requires two pilots for IFR operations, it is certified for VFR operations with a minimum crew of one pilot. In addition to the crew, the short- and long-frame versions can carry, respectively, up to 17 and 19 passengers in certified seats (or a few more than that if the aircraft is used for troop transport). For the aerial work version, Airbus calculates a maximum range of 366 nautical miles, and a maximum endurance of three hours and 48 minutes, with standard fuel tanks carrying 411 US gallons. Those figures are slightly higher for the multi-role version, which carries 540 US gallons in its standard fuel tanks. Central auxiliary fuel tanks are available for the aerial work H215, while both external and central aux fuel tanks can be added to the multi-role version. At sea level, estimated fuel consumption at recommended cruise speed is around 1,070 to 1,100 lb. per hour (475 to 505 kg/hr). If you have experience with older models of the AS332 L1 or C1, these numbers should sound familiar to you. As far as the basic aircraft goes, there’s not much new to report (the Makila 1A1 engines, for example, still lack full authority digital engine control). But Airbus sees this tried-and-true airframe as a selling point for utility operators, who, as previously noted, aren’t exactly lining up for the newest helicopter models on the market. According to Airbus, more than 945 units of the Super Puma/Cougar family have collectively flown more than 5.2 million flight hours, so they’ve had some time to work out the bugs.

As revolutionary as the H215’s glass cockpit appears in context, it, too, is proven technology, as the same Advanced Helicopter Cockpit Avionics System (AHCAS) is used on the H225. That puts it one generation behind Airbus Helicopters’ latest avionics package, Helionix (which appears on the company’s newest models, the H175 and H145). Nevertheless, the AHCAS package is vastly more sophisticated than the systems that most utility helicopter pilots are used to, and it was the primary focus of my own demonstration flight out of Louisville’s Bowman Field.

The H215 used for the U.S. demo tour was a short-frame “aerial work” version, which can carry up to 17 passengers in a certified seating configuration.



Behind the controlsMy guide for the flight was Airbus Helicopters, Inc. retired vice president of flight operations Del Livingston, who had already given nine or 10 other demo flights by the time I climbed into the right seat. He must have been tired, but he didn’t show it — and that may have had something to do with the beaming enthusiasm of most of his co-pilots. There’s no question that the H215 is a joy to fly, and I didn’t speak with any other pilot that day who failed to have a great time.I hot-seated with another pilot, so we were ready to go as soon as I settled in. I started with ground-taxiing to the runway and picking up into a hover, both of which were so easy as to be relative non-events. After giving me a moment to get the feel for the aircraft, Livingston started to demonstrate the auto-hover capabilities of the H215’s four-axis autopilot, but approaching traffic didn’t give us time to linger. So, we beeped up to about 50 feet above the runway, then I pressed a “go-around” button on the cyclic to initiate a takeoff to the north over a grass field. With no intervention from me, the aircraft smoothly accelerated and began to climb. At Livingston’s advice, I directed the AFCS to level off at an altitude of 1,500 feet, which was about 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL).Suddenly, our airspace got very busy (with another pilot even reporting a drone at our altitude, which was a first for me). The autopilot came in handy as we spent the next few minutes listening to the radio and looking for traffic. Once things calmed down, Livingston demonstrated some of the niftier features of the AFCS, including airspeed protection. First, he had me increase the cruise speed as high as it would go, which, as we were lightly loaded and close to sea level, was close to the aircraft’s never-exceed speed of 164 knots. Then, he went into the helicopter’s flight management system to input a higher payload than actual. With this new information, the AFCS calculated a new, lower maximum speed, and automatically decelerated to meet it. That automatic airspeed protection is certainly something I would appreciate on long ferry flights at high altitudes.

With this new information, the AFCS calculated a new, lower maximum speed, and automatically decelerated to meet it. That automatic airspeed protection is certainly something I would appreciate on long ferry flights at high altitudes. With less than an hour to spend in the air, I didn’t have a chance to fully explore the logic of the AFCS, or pick up on its nuances. But from my brief exposure to it, its operation struck me as very intuitive. The multi-function displays were also very clear and easy to interpret, while the vehicle management system displays should look familiar to anyone with experience in Airbus Helicopters products.

The H215 uses the same Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines found on the AS332 C1 and L1.

Next, Livingston gave me a chance to hand-fly the aircraft, and its wonderful control feel was probably the biggest surprise of my flight. Most of my experience in medium- and heavy-lift helicopters has been in those clunky older models that dominate the utility industry in North America. They’re fun to fly because, well, they’re helicopters, but there’s not much that can be said in objective praise of their handling qualities. The H215, on the other hand, was remarkably smooth and nimble for a utility aircraft of its size. After I had drilled a few holes in the sky, I made an approach to a wooded island in the Ohio River, where I practiced some vertical reference hovering over the trees at 100 feet AGL. Although winds were admittedly light on the day of my flight, the H215 was incredibly stable and easy to hover — it felt like cheating. After a minute or two, Livingston engaged the auto-hover function, which really felt like cheating. It struck me that the aircraft would do a lot to alleviate pilot fatigue in either regime. On the return to Bowman Field, Livingston demonstrated another protection of the AFCS: altitude protection. As we made our approach to the runway with the autopilot engaged, Livingston dialed in a target altitude below field elevation. Rather than fly us into the ground, the aircraft leveled off at a radar altitude of 150 feet (this protected altitude drops to 70 feet when the aircraft is flying an ILS approach). That would be a great feature to have while working in snowy environments in flat light. After I hover-taxied back to the ramp, Livingston once again engaged the auto-hover function. He then had me beep the helicopter down to a perfectly controlled landing, demonstrating its ability to land safely in whiteout or brownout conditions. Before my flight in the H215, I was skeptical of the relevance of a glass cockpit and four-axis autopilot for utility operations. By the end of it, I was sold, both on their safety benefits and their practicality.

The H215’s advanced cockpit technologies genuinely enhance safety and capability. It remains to be seen, however, whether operators will decide the upgrades are worth the associated expense.

The $16 million question So are the H215’s upgrades worth the associated expense? The answer to that question will depend on each operator, its customers, and their missions. Airbus Helicopters is keenly aware of the need to keep the H215 affordable for the utility market. It recently commenced construction on a new factory for the H215 in Brasov, Romania, where the helicopter will be assembled at a lower cost than on the current production line in Marignane, France. The first Romanian-built aircraft is expected to roll off the assembly line in 2017. As previously reported by Vertical, the company is aiming to keep the H215 competitive with a new Mi-171, with an acquisition cost of €14 to 15 million (around US$16 million) in a standard configuration. That cost may be readily justifiable for operators who work in harsh and expeditionary environments; who need IFR and passenger-carrying capability in addition to a solid lifting machine. Since its 2014 launch, the H215 has been marketed for passenger and cargo transport, humanitarian missions, medical evacuations, and search-and-rescue, all of which are logical fits for the aircraft and its sophisticated avionics. On its latest North American demo tour, Airbus touted the H215 for aerial firefighting, but it had one primary customer in mind — Cal Fire, which is looking to replace its fleet of modified H-model Hueys. The H215 would certainly represent a leap in capability for Cal Fire, and the agency could well decide that the aircraft’s safety-enhancing technologies and standard-category certification are worth the considerable investment.

Airbus offers an electronic flight bag solution for the H215 called Helitab. Housed in a Panasonic Toughpad, it allows pilots to record, access, and manage data in a fully integrated digital format."
