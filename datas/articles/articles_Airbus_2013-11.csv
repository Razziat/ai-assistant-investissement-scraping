The latest air warfare: Seat sizes - CNBC,"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTMvMTEvMTcvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1haXItd2FyZmFyZS1iZXR3ZWVuLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXNlYXQtc2l6ZXMuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDEzLzExLzE3L3RoZS1sYXRlc3QtYWlyLXdhcmZhcmUtYmV0d2Vlbi1ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1zZWF0LXNpemVzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the seemingly never-ending rivalry between Boeing and Airbus , no stone is left unturned - and that includes the upholstery.

Not content with the battle between their respective aircraft, most notably the Dreamliner versus A350, the American and European manufacturers have argued over the size of economy seats on their aircraft ahead of this fall's Dubai Air Show.

Airbus is arguing that the air transport sector needs to adopt a standard seat width size of 18 inches (45.72 cm) for long-haul aircraft. Boeing said that such a seat size request was ""arbitrary.""

This is not a mere sideshow in the Airbus-Boeing battle, but a real fight for customers.



Lots of airlines request that Boeing use 17 inch (43.18 cm) seats in its 777-300ER aircraft, as this means the economy section can seat 10 chairs across, and more paying customers per plane is a definite plus for airlines. Airbus uses nine-abreast on the A350 and eight-abreast on the A330.

The U.K.'s London Sleep Center, in conjunction with Airbus, recorded the sleep measurements of six healthy adults in both 17- and 18-inch seats. This involved monitoring brainwaves, eye, abdominal, chest and hip leg movement. The conclusion was that ""a minimum seat width of 18 inches improved passenger sleep quality by 53 percent when compared to the 1950s 17 inch standard.

Kevin Keniston, Airbus' Head of Passenger Comfort, said following the research, ""Not only does seat width make a dramatic impact on passenger comfort but there is now a growing cohort of discerning economy passengers who are not prepared to accept long haul 17 inch crusher seats and instead will choose airlines that offer better seat comfort, often turning to social media or specialist websites to determine true seat value.""

Seat width is an increasingly hot topic when it comes to long-haul air travel given the changing shape of the average flyer.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than one-third of U.S. adults (35.7 percent) are obese, and there has been a dramatic increase in obesity across the world in the last 30 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that ""the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008. According to country estimates for 2008, over 50 percent of both men and women in the WHO European Region were overweight, and roughly 23 percent of women and 20 percent of men were obese.

The AFP reported this week that a Frenchman weighing 500 pounds was told he was too fat to fly on a plane so was forced to travel by ship to return home from the U.S. The New York Daily News and other outlets also reported the case of Les Price, a 519-pound man from Wales, who was told to buy two separate seats for a return-flight and was accidentally given seats in two separate places on both journeys.

Seat structure

While the argument between Boeing and Airbus revolves around seat width, many commentators argue that seat pitch (legroom) is a more important determining factor when it comes to passenger comfort.

The AP reported that U.S. airlines such as Southwest, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines had all introduced new seas that place the magazine pocket above the tray table, away from the passenger's knees, and they use lighter-weight frames and padding that allow for more seats across the width of the plane.

This development began in 2010 when Lufthansa began using Recaro seats on its aircraft, notably the Basic Line 3520 seat, which used lighter material to reduce the weight of each seat to less than eleven kilograms, which was around 30 percent lighter than previous chair models. Thus, the BL3520's minimal weight allows airlines to lower costs by reducing fuel consumption. It also allows for more passengers on the plane, not width-wise, but length-wise.

Dr. Mark Hiller, the chief executive officer of Recaro Aircraft Seating, spoke to CNBC via email, and explained how the Recaro seat, which the company has received over 170,000 orders for since 2010, allows for more passengers as well as more legroom.

""The BL3520 offers passengers more legroom than comparable seats,"" he said. ""This is possible due to a leaner, space-saving backrest combined with patented Recaro solutions, such as the literature pocket being positioned above the tray table, rather than at knee level. This leads to more space for passengers' legs, while enabling airlines to install additional rows of seats.""

As Hiller stressed, these Recaro seats are not smaller in size, simply slimmer. What about the whole Boeing versus Airbus seat width debate? ""The width of the seat has not decreased compared to previous seat models,"" Hiller replied. ""On the contrary:the seat width is greater now due to the fact that the armrests are slimmer."""
"Lufthansa does not support Airbus campaign for 18"" seat width standard - Runway Girl Network","Sun, 10 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3J1bndheWdpcmxuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS8yMDEzLzExL3VwZGF0ZS1sdWZ0aGFuc2EtZG9lcy1ub3Qtc3VwcG9ydC1haXJidXMtY2FtcGFpZ24tdG8tbWFrZS0xOC1pbmNoZXMtdGhlLXN0YW5kYXJkLWZvci1zZWF0LXdpZHRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lufthansa is not throwing its support behind Airbus’ campaign to make 18 inches the standard for seat width on long-haul aircraft.

With respect to “a focus of 18 inches or so, we cannot see that”, Nico Buchholz, executive VP Lufthansa Group fleet management, said today at a media briefing in New York.

Buchholz says the carrier has studied a number of cabin seat scenarios, including looking at seat width. “Yes, we all know there is a certain limit on long-haul where [people] feel uncomfortable. But if you take, for example, the [Boeing] 747, and you sit in economy, is the seat width acceptable providing you have sufficient pitch? So it’s not only [about] the width. So maybe on a night flight you want to stretch your feet in front of you, so maybe [this matters to you more than width].”

The Lufthansa executive acknowledges that people have gotten “bigger”, even as seat width in economy class has trended smaller, but he notes in reference to Airbus’ campaign for an 18-inch standard, “We all heard about Airbus’ idea to improve the A380, 11-abreast, [which would be] much narrower of any of the Boeing seats.”

Indeed, many industry observers believe Airbus’ reason for pushing for an 18-inch standard is primarily driven by the competitive pressure it feels from Boeing’s highly successful 777-300ER – which airlines are increasingly ordering in a 10-abreast configuration in economy class – as well as the threat of the forthcoming 777X to the A350, the latter of which can offer 18-inch wide economy class seats in 9-abreast configuration.

It is perhaps somewhat ironic that Airbus continues to advertise the option for airlines to order a “high-efficiency” A330 in 9-abreast configuration with a 16.7-inch seat width, as evidenced here, and a high-density 10-abreast A350, despite its call for comfort on long-haul aircraft.

Meanwhile, having the flexibility to configure its aircraft as it chooses is crucial to Lufthansa. For instance, notes Buchholz, the low-cost model for short- to medium-haul flying has spread throughout Europe. ”We have been able to increase the seating without needing the floor strengthening,” he says. This means that flexibility is “built into our specification” for airframers.

Buchholz adds, “We know the product will probably change over the life of the aircraft at least three times so the aircraft needs to be flexible. Lavatories, galleys, seat arrangements, entertainment systems, overhead bins, all of these elements need to be handled [as] flexible.”

Lufthansa recently committed to orders for 34 Boeing 777-9Xs and 25 Airbus A350-900s, which will primarily serve to replace existing aircraft at the carrier. Buchholz reveals that Lufthansa refused to be limited to the Airbus A350 catalogue for seats. “We don’t like the catalogue and we won’t take the catalogue.”

He says the company’s Lufthansa Technik unit helps to serve as a “pressure point” in negotiations with airframers, as the carrier is able to tell them, “We could take aircraft bare and not use their seats.”

Adds Buchholz, “I think we like standardization on the technical points, [but] we don’t like standardization on the cabin. The differentiating factor of product is service, network, pricing and the cabin so we want to keep certain control of the cabin. So what we’d like manufacturers to do is [take a] hybrid approach. There are some smaller airlines that are happy to use the catalogues, and there are bigger airlines who don’t like the catalogue because there are airlines that are ahead.”"
Earnings Call Shows Why Astrium Is Being Merged into Airbus Defence & Space - SpaceNews,"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zODE1N2Vhcm5pbmdzLWNhbGwtc2hvd3Mtd2h5LWFzdHJpdW0taXMtYmVpbmctbWVyZ2VkLWludG8tYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Europe’s Astrium space hardware and services provider on Nov. 14 reported a slight increase in sales and higher profitability for the nine months ending Sept. 30, a period that nonetheless illustrated why Astrium is being merged by its corporate parent, EADS, with EADS’s defense and security business, EADS Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said.

Total Astrium revenue for the period was 4.01 billion euros ($5.4 billion), up 2 percent from the first nine months of 2012. Its backlog, at 12.9 billion euros, was down 6.6 percent from a year ago, but its pretax profit margin was 5.1 percent, up from 4.8 percent last year. The company trimmed its research and development spending during the period, from 2.2 percent of revenue to 1.9 percent.

EADS, which in January will change its name and the name of its divisions to adopt the better-known Airbus brand, has set as a goal an average 10 percent pretax profit margin for its businesses by 2015, and has said this will not be possible for Astrium without a merger with EADS’s Cassidian division in January. The combined company will be called Airbus Defence & Space.

In a conference call with investors, Wilhelm said the Astrium Services division has been underperforming of late because of increased competition and a difficult environment for government orders, but that the satellites and space-transportation businesses have been doing well.

Astrium’s space transportation division includes French ballistic missiles as well as the Ariane 5 rocket and space station work. It reported a 4.2 percent increase in revenue for the period, to 1.72 billion euros. Wilhelm said the satellite business, “believe it or not,” whose profit-margin outlook remains far from the 10 percent goal, has also been growing. For the nine months ending Sept. 30, Astrium satellite hardware revenue increased by 8 percent, to 1.32 billion euros.

These two divisions’ increases were partly offset by Astrium Services, whose revenue was down 9 percent, to 962.4 million euros, as a result of increased competition and slackening government orders.

Astrium Services’ product lines include optical and radar Earth observation imagery sales and the provision of X-band communications to allied governments.

Wilhelm said merging Astrium with Cassidian into the new Airbus Defence & Space unit will enable the two entities to share overhead and other costs and bring them closer to the overall company’s profit target.

In the satellite manufacturing business, Wilhelm said, “it is more difficult to bring the top line up and the bottom line as well.” Astrium Satellites alone, he said, “won’t get to the 10 percent level, which is the justification for bundling defense and space under one roof to trim costs and overhead. That will compensate for the headroom we are lacking on the satellite side” in terms of profitability.

Airbus Military delivers additional P-3AM patrol aircraft to FAB - Airforce Technology - Airforce Technology,"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2FpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS1kZWxpdmVycy1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLXAtM2FtLXBhdHJvbC1haXJjcmFmdC10by1mYWIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has handed over an additional P-3AM Orion patrol aircraft to the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) at its facility in Seville, Spain.



The aircraft represents the seventh P-3AM Orion delivered to date by the company as part of the FAB patrol aircraft fleet modernisation contract awarded by the Air Force Command (COMAER), through the Coordinating Committee of Combat Aircraft Program (COPAC).



Carrying a registration number of FAB7208, the newly delivered aircraft is fitted with one of the most modern radar systems available for identification, and a forward looking infra-red (FLIR) optical system that offers additional information on maritime traffic while providing clear imagery even at night.



The systems are designed to enable location, identification and recording of the whole shipping scenario of vessels for the Brazilian Navy, and also direct its policing activities to the most critical areas.

""The aircraft represents the seventh P-3AM Orion delivered to date by the company as part of the FAB patrol aircraft fleet modernisation contract.""

In addition to this, the upgraded P-3AM aircraft uses Airbus Military’s fully integrated tactical system (FITS) and can carry a range of weapons, including the Boeing-built AGM-84 Harpoon Block II anti-ship missile, FlightGlobal reports.



Primarily designed for use in monitoring and protection of marine areas and natural resources of the Amazon, especially of the ‘pre-sal’ region of the continental shelf, the P-3AM Orion also supports search-and-rescue (SAR) activities in the South Atlantic region, which falls under the responsibility of Brazil.



Powered by four Allison T56-A-14 turboprop engines, the P-3 Orion is currently used for maritime patrol, reconnaissance, anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare missions by multiple navies and air forces across the globe.

At least one of the deals could be announced at next week's Dubai Airshow, marking the first time the Abu Dhabi carrier has played a significant role at the showcase event hosted by its closest rival, Emirates airline, the people said. The number of plane orders being discussed and the possible value was not immediately clear. Etihad's potential interest includes the Airbus A320neo, a fuel-saving version of the European planemaker's best-selling medium-haul jet, as well as a modified or expanded order for its long-haul A350 aircraft, one source said. Etihad and Airbus both declined to comment. Reuters reported last month Etihad was close to ordering Boeing jets including 25 to 30 777X mini-jumbos, the new 777 version which is expected to be launched at next week's air show, and a repeat order for about 30 787 Dreamliners. ""I have made no comment on that at all; that is Reuters speculating ... I think you should wait until we make an announcement,"" Etihad's chief executive James Hogan told Dubai-based Arabian Business magazine last week. People tracking the twin-track negotiations said Etihad's potential combined deals with Airbus and Boeing may cover the aircraft needs of all of its equity partners, which include Air Berlin , Virgin Australia and Aer Lingus . An announcement of Etihad's 777X order could pre-empt a widely expected blockbuster deal for 100 or more 777X jets from Emirates airline , which has said it may announce a large Boeing order when it hosts the November 17-21 air show. Word of parallel talks between Etihad and Airbus came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the airline's first commercial flight linking Abu Dhabi and Beirut on Nov 12, 2003. Boeing and Airbus officials have set up camp in the Gulf as they look to solidify plane orders with Etihad and other fast-growing carriers including Emirates and Qatar Airways that are buying more planes to expand their global reach. Taking advantage of deep pockets and a geographically strategic position between East and West, Gulf airlines are expanding rapidly and diverting long-haul traffic from airlines in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia.

Gulf airlines, led by Dubai's Emirates and Abu Dhabi's Etihad, struck plane deals worth almost $150 billion — or more, including options — on the first day of the Dubai Airshow on Sunday.

The buying spree underscored a shift in power in the aviation industry, as oil-rich, fast-growing economies of the Gulf take advantage of their strategic position between East and West to draw more travellers from hubs in Europe and Asia.

While the orders are a big boost to Airbus and Boeing, the world's dominant civil aircraft manufacturers, suppliers in Europe and the United States are worried they will suffer from the growing globalization of the aircraft supply chain, in which Gulf firms are playing a part.

Airbus agreed a new deal on Monday with Abu Dhabi's state investment fund Mubadala to expand their partnership ""for further composite and metallic aerostructure production in the United Arab Emirates, in addition to procurement of composite raw materials, worth $2.5 billion,"" Mubadala said.

Reuters reported on Sunday the two parties were close to an agreement.

Separately, Boeing said it had also signed a new deal with Mubadala for Abu Dhabi to supply as much as $2.5 billion in advanced composites and machine metals to the U.S. planemaker.

In addition, Boeing said it had reached an agreement with Abu Dhabi's Tawazun Precision Industries, a state-owned manufacturing company, to set up a facility in the United Arab Emirates for producing aerospace parts.

The facility will be up and running by 2016 and will produce parts for other aircraft manufacturers as well as Boeing, the two parties said, without disclosing financial details."

Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, has ordered 50 Airbus A380 jets, it announced Sunday at the Dubai Air Show.

The $20.2 billion deal is a reversal of fortune for Airbus, which had not sold a single A380 in 2013.

Just a few weeks ago, Reuters reported, the plane maker was considering cutting A380 production to avoid building planes it could not sell.

The double-decker A380 has been in service since 2007 and is flown by ten airlines. The world's largest passenger jet, it can cover 8,500 nautical miles on a full tank. It usually seats about 500 passengers, though it can fit more than 800.

Emirates, recently dubbed the world's best airline, is the biggest A380 customer, with 39 currently in service. Unlike most airlines, which are drawn to leaner, more efficient jets, it has expressed interest in an even larger plane — perhaps even one with three levels.

While the sale is good news for Airbus, the European plane maker has been roundly beaten by its arch rival Boeing at the Dubai show. Emirates placed the A380 order just minutes after ordering 150 jets from Boeing."

Airbus A400M - Military Power - MotorTrend,"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvMTMxMi1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tbWlsaXRhcnktcG93ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Still in its testing phase, the Airbus A400M is poised to take the military world by storm. Built to meet the transportation needs of modern armed forces, this all-new cargo plane can perform missions that previously required two or more different aircraft to complete. The A400M has the ability to transport a CH-47 Chinook helicopter, two heavy-armored vehicles, rescue boats, or mobile cranes for disaster relief inside of its cargo hold—all while remaining agile enough to fly through hostile air.

Advertisement

Technology

One of the key elements of the A400M’s versatility is its all-new turboprop engine. Fitting the aircraft with four 11,000hp Europrop TP400-DX engines allows for a wide range of speeds and flight levels and offers extremely efficient fuel consumption. The cockpit features two head-up-display units, which provide the pilots with all primary flight information, along with flight director orders and guidance during critical mission phases, such as landing at unequipped airfields, refueling, or low-level flight. In addition, the cockpit utilizes eight LCD screens: three for each pilot and two for systems monitoring. The A400M also makes use of fly-by-wire controls, giving much greater precision to flight commands, allowing for optimum performance during critical or extreme escape maneuvers.

Survivability is key for any military aircraft, and the A400M was designed with this specifically in mind. The aircraft is built for low detectability and low vulnerability, with damage-tolerant flight controls, an armored cockpit, and bullet-resistant windscreens. With its minimal infrared signature, highly responsive flight control system, steep descent and climb performance, and comprehensive defensive aids, the A400M is hard to find, hard to hit, and hard to kill.

Operational Flexibility

The A400M is designed to be a true jack-of-all-trades. In addition to hauling cargo and supplies, the aircraft can be outfitted to provide air-to-air refueling for any type of aircraft or helicopter. This is due in part to its ability to fly at low speeds and low altitude, and higher speeds at high altitude, providing support for the entire range of probe-equipped military aircraft, at their preferred speed and altitude. In addition, the A400M itself can be equipped to accept in-flight refueling, greatly increasing its range.

Airbus Military is setting new standards in paratrooper operations. The A400M can accommodate up to 116 fully equipped paratroopers, carrying them to drop zones as high as 40,000 feet for Special Forces operations. Delivering supplies to forward troop outfits, the aircraft has the ability to fly as low as 15 feet for low-level load deliveries and can airdrop up to 55 100-pound containers or pallets via its automated release system.

Serving in a humanitarian role, the A400M can be equipped for medical evacuations. Along with the eight stretchers that are permanently stored onboard, it can accommodate as many as 66 additional NATO stretchers and 25 medical personnel, seated on troop seats.

Tactical Performance

Thanks to the aircraft’s short landing ability, the A400M is able to transport critical equipment and personnel directly to where they are needed most—near the site of the action. The ability to take off and land on unmaintained runways is credited in part to the use of turboprop engines, which are less sensitive to debris ingestion than typical jet engines. To further minimize the risk of damage from foreign objects, the A400M is fitted with a 12-wheel main landing gear and an airframe that is designed to efficiently absorb shock loads, allowing for safe operations on stone, gravel, and even sand runways. In addition to supporting military operations, these characteristics ensure swift humanitarian aid can be directly deployed to disaster regions, should the need arise.

An 11-abreast Emirates A380 may ride on new interior - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTMvMTEvYW4tMTEtYWJyZWFzdC1lbWlyYXRlcy1hMzgwLW1heS1yaWRlLW9uLW5ldy1pbnRlcmlvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Inch by inch, row by row, Airbus and Boeing are making their cash coffers grow by squeezing more economy class seats into their widebody aircraft. But is Airbus pushing its luck in proffering an 11-abreast, high-density configuration on the A380?

The answer to that question will likely ride on whether Airbus cabin engineers can suitably reshape the A380 interior to Emirates’ liking.

The prospect of being seated in the center of a 3-5-3 layout in economy class is quite harrowing for some passengers, who fear they’ll suffer from claustrophobia even if Airbus somehow ensures that each seat has a width of 18 inches (which is the airframer’s newly proposed “standard” for comfort on long-haul flights). A 3-4-3 configuration on Boeing 777-300ER aircraft “is already bad”, notes frequent flyer Stefan Paetow. Being seated in the center of five seats on an A380 configured in 3-5-3 “would be hell”, he says.

Paetow and other travelers will be happy to learn that Emirates shares their concerns. After announcing a fresh order for 50 A380s yesterday at the Dubai Air Show, Emirates president Tim Clark was asked about the carrier’s interest level in offering an 11-abreast layout, which would increase the number of economy seats on the double decker aircraft by about 40. “Our president responded that Airbus [is] proposing it, with a minimum 18-inch seat, but we have not been persuaded yet,” confirms Emirates VP, product, publishing, digital and events Patrick Brannelly.

At present, Emirates offers 19-inch wide seats in 10-abreast formation on its A380s. It’s not immediately clear how Airbus could offer an 18-inch width minimum in 11-abreast, though some space could potentially be reclaimed between the outer seat and the sidewall. “Here’s something that’s always puzzled me: in most aircraft, the window armrest does not raise. It’s difficult to see a need for that window armrest not to raise, particularly on widebody aircraft where the fuselage curves outwards rather than inwards at window level. It seems to be a clear opportunity for airlines to really offer additional space for every window passenger,” says John Walton, director of data at RouteHappy.

But for Emirates, the physical 3-5-3 layout represents much more of a barrier to offering an 11-abreast A380 than the width of the seats. To wit, Emirates’ 777-300ERs are configured 10-abreast with 17-inch wide seats (the same width as on a 737 narrowbody). And Emirates yesterday further endorsed the 777 when the carrier announced a whopping 150-jet order for the twinjet’s successor, the newly launched 777X, which can carry up to 406 seats if configured 10-abreast with economy class seats that are just wider than 17 inches.

Indeed, Tim Clark “said the real issue [with an 11-abreast A380] is the middle seat of 5 in the 3-5-3 configuration. Emirates is focused on comfort and I don’t think we’d ever compromise on that,” says Brannelly. This begs the question of whether Emirates would consider a 4-3-4 configuration.

What now seems apparent, however, is that Emirates is edging ever closer to offering 11-abreast on the A380. Aviation Week quotes Clark as saying, “I’m sure Airbus is going to persuade us to do it”.

But how can Airbus offer more seats and meet it’s own proposed 18-inch standard for seat comfort?

Walton reiterates that allowing the window seat armrest to swivel is a solid first step. “If you look, for example, at the Bombardier Q400, the cabin floor is lower than the diameter, much lower than it would be on a comparable 3-3 narrowbody. If you’re in a window seat on a Q400, the vertical structure of the seat supports in front of you come out roughly a third of the way across that seat, so it’s already possible to have a seating area wider than the cabin floor on the 2-2 turboprops. So why shouldn’t passengers have seats that go all the way up to the window?”

Meanwhile, after finding a sweet spot with the 10-abreast 777-300ER, Boeing is now focused on carving out a little more space for passengers on the 777X. While it has dismissed Airbus’ call for an 18-inch standard, the US airframer is fully aware that passengers regularly voice their discontent about super-snug 10-abreast configurations on social media and travel forums.

Walton says, “I’d be surprised if Boeing isn’t factoring this [traditional armrest removal] into its 777-9X considerations, given the level of passenger dissatisfaction with 3-4-3 on a 777-300ER. And certainly with new distribution opportunities – such as the distribution opportunities that we’re looking at with Routehappy, that IATA is looking at with NDC, and that airlines are looking at of their own volition – there is no reason why this can’t be solved in some way. I can’t believe this wasted space has gone unaddressed for so long.”

The plane will enter service early next year, part of American’s fleet renewal plan that includes $38 billion worth of new aircraft designed to give the company a more fuel efficient and comfortable set of planes.

Of course the addition of Airbus planes, as well as the new Boeing 777 aircraft, has caused some concern at the Tulsa American Airlines maintenance and overhaul base, where American does the major repairs and overhaul on Boeing 737, MD-80s and other aircraft.

The A321T, for transcontinental, will go into service next year and serve the New York-LA and New York-San Francisco routes.

The biggest feature are the lay-flat seats in first and business class. Like other newer jets, all the planes have in-seat entertainment systems with movies, games and tv programs.

“As the only airline to offer a three-class transcontinental service, we’re delivering on what our customers flying between New York and the West Coast Value, said Virasb Vahidi, American’s Chief Commercial Officer in a statement. “With fully-lie flat seats in the premium cabins, new menu options and enhanced amenities, the A321T aircraft allows us to provide our customers with amenities that, until now, have traditionally been reserved for those traveling internationally.”

American Airlines plans to take a total of 260 new Airbus aircraft, all in the A320 and A320 neo families in the coming years.

The company plans to retire its 190 remaining MD-80 aircraft by 2018.

American hasn’t committed yet to where the new aircraft will be maintained, but it will be years before the new aircraft need major overhaul anyways."
Boeing Is Cranking Up 737 Production - Business Insider,"Fri, 01 Nov 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9laW5nLWluY3JlYXNlcy03MzctcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRlLTIwMTMtMTHSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2JvZWluZy1pbmNyZWFzZXMtNzM3LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcmF0ZS0yMDEzLTExP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing's 737 assembly line in Renton, Washington. Boeing

(Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> said it would increase production of its workhorse 737 aircraft to 47 planes per month by 2017 from 38 now, a surprise move that analysts said boded well for the company, its suppliers and airlines.

Advertisement

Boeing had already announced plans to increase production to 42 per month in the first half of 2014, matching current output by rival Airbus SA <EAD.PA> of its competing A320 jet family.

With the new target, Boeing would enter territory that Airbus isn't attempting. The output, from the same footprint at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, will not only boost Boeing's cash pile, it will give the company more delivery slots to sell to airlines who want new, fuel-efficient planes sooner.

""This is a big, bold, but very strategic move by Boeing,"" that follows recent competitive wins by Airbus that likely have been ""more heavily price-driven than in the past,"" said Russell Solomon, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.

He said Boeing can also be aggressive on price and now can talk with customers about new orders ""with the very pointed message that they won't have to wait as long to get their greatly desired new equipment if they buy Boeing vs. the other guy.""

Because of the high volume and relatively low production costs, the 737 and A320 are often seen as cash cows, and play a big role in funding development of larger and technically more challenging aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or the Airbus A350.

Boeing's rate increase was more ambitious than some forecasts. Carter Copeland, analyst at Barclays in New York, said he had penciled in Boeing building 46 737s a month around 2018. ""I definitely didn't expect an announcement on it so soon,"" he said.

Just last week, Boeing said it would lift production of its 787 wide-body jet to 12 per month by 2016 and 14 per month by 2020 , up from a target of 10 a month by the end of 2013.

While Copeland said he didn't have major concerns about the 737 supply chain keeping up with higher rates, he said producing so many of the current 737s and the 737 MAX ""would seem somewhat challenging on the surface.""

He added, ""I'm sure the supply chain is quite pleased as the 737 is a profit leader for essentially everyone who's on it.""

Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice President Beverly Wyse said in a statement that the higher rate would ""lay a solid foundation as we bridge into production on the 737 MAX."" [ID:nPn780Z50]

Related stories

The company has 3,400 orders for 737 aircraft, including about 1,500 next-generation MAX models.

The 737 MAX will have new engines and other changes to make it about 14 percent more fuel efficient than current models.

Boeing said the first delivery of the 737 MAX is on track for the third quarter of 2017.

In contrast to the Boeing target, the chief executive of Airbus this week reiterated plans to hold its production rate of competing A320-family aircraft steady at 42 per month, saying the European company had some concerns about the fragility of the supply chain [ID:nL5N0IJ3S4].

Rob Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Boeing's move ""might give Airbus reason to accelerate"" its production beyond the 42 a month.

Airbus' output for narrow-body jets is based on an 11.5-month production calendar, implying average capacity for 483 aircraft like the single-aisle A320 a year.

Advertisement

Boeing is based on a 12 month production schedule, though the company traditionally closes for the week between Christmas and New Year.

Stallard said the new Boeing target was ""incrementally positive"" because speculation about rate increases in the latter half of the decade may had have ""fully baked in the ramp, and suggests that the current up-cycle continues to have legs.""

He added that any rate ramp carries risk.

Airbus and Boeing both see demand for over $2 trillion worth of such aircraft over the next 20 years.

Singapore 21: a farewell trip on the world's longest flight - Engadget,"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS8yMDEzLTExLTIzLWZseWluZy1zaW5nYXBvcmUtMjEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As of tomorrow, the longest flight in the world will shuttle passengers on a 747-400 from Sydney, Australia to Dallas, Texas. That 15-hour, 25-minute hop on board Qantas 7 may not be the lengthiest in duration, but at 8,578 miles gate to gate, it'll lead the industry in miles flown. For a few more hours, however, Singapore Airlines' decade-long run from Newark, N.J., to Singapore remains the record holder for both time (more than 18 hours) and distance (9,534 miles). It's a journey that's been on the bucket lists of the world's most ambitious aviation enthusiasts since the city-state's namesake airline first launched the service in 2004, and following tonight's final jaunt, this record-setting A340-500 will touch down at Changi Airport for the very last time.

Despite this cheerless loss, it's a spectacular time in the world of aviation. Sure, we don't have our supersonic Concorde replacement just yet, and the Dreamliner rollout was not without significant heartbreak, but the past few years have represented a tremendous period, with banner launches from both Airbus and Boeing that will change the way we fly forever. But as with any category, aircraft manufacturing and design advances also serve to highlight the shortcomings of previous-generation products.

The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 make massive efficiency boosts a reality, leading gas-guzzling greats like the aging A340-500 to a premature retirement. In this case, the A345's departure from Singapore's fleet represents not only better things to come, but also the loss of a landmark route -- it's an unavoidable compromise, and with the end in sight, I drained my frequent flier account in order to score a ticket, and set out to discover the significance of Singapore Flight 21's retirement.

With just 100 seats on board, the all-business-class flight primarily serves deep-pocketed globetrotting executives -- many work in the banking industry, often splitting their time between Singapore and New York. (Singapore Airlines retired a similar-length flight from Los Angeles last month.) The nonstop route saves travelers three hours or more over connecting options, including Singapore 25, which has a two-hour layover in Frankfurt. Those three hours, at least for the airline, weren't enough to justify keeping the A345 in the air, due in no small part to the enormous expense of carrying the additional gas necessary to ferry passengers without a requisite refueling stop.

After boarding through Newark's aging Terminal B, our flight departed around 11PM on November 14th, landing two days later at 6:20AM local time in Singapore. All 100 seats on the A340-500, less those in the last two rows, are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, affording each passenger direct access to the aisle and an incredibly generous seat width of two and a half feet. By comparison, Emirates, which also operates the -500 variant, squeezes an extra two business seats into each row, and carries coach passengers in a 2-4-2 configuration. I snagged a window seat in the third row -- 14A -- so as to avoid light from the galley and noise from the aircraft's four engines, humming away some 100 feet behind. It ended up being a perfect fit, but despite the comfort of a large, 15.4-inch in-flight-entertainment system, tons of legroom and a flatbed seat, I was eager to deplane with nearly 15 hours left to go.

But back to the beginning. Despite our flight originating in the US, Singapore Airlines doesn't yet allow gate-to-gate personal electronic device use, so I rushed to fire off a few final emails and Instagram photos as the remaining passengers made their way to their seats. A few hours after takeoff, I pulled out my laptop somewhere over Newfoundland and connected to the OnAir satellite WiFi service. After paying $29 for 30MB of internet usage, I caught up with email using the low-bandwidth Gmail mobile site. I spent the next six hours sleeping, tweeting and checking email, and I decided to lift the window shade when the in-flight map showed that we were positioned 35,000 feet above Warsaw.

Daylight filled my seat halfway through the flight, so I went to the galley to chat with the crew, asking flight attendants about their experiences with the A345, and whether or not they'd miss working on the plane. The staff seemed to be trained to avoid such questions, as politely as possible, and each attendant I spoke to provided a brief response before changing the subject, always insisting that I have more to eat and drink, instead. Oddly, Singapore caters this flight (and only this flight) with a few boxes of Dunkin' Donuts, and since no SQ21 experience would be complete without one, I made my request.

Some hours later, I returned with a few more questions, this time turning down offers for more food. Sadly, the crew only offered up a few minor details. Not surprisingly, they loved the plane, and really enjoyed flying that route. One of the attendants on my flight said he works the A340 once every six weeks, and this was that crew's final trip. I had plenty more blanks to fill in, but it seemed inappropriate to ask, for example, whether the on-board ""corpse locker,"" which was installed to avoid diverting should there be a fatality mid-flight, had ever been used. I figured questions about passenger loads would also be rebuffed, though a quick tour of the plane confirmed my suspicions that this particular flight was sold out. Ultimately, I felt awkward querying the crew about the end of their beloved flight, so I returned to my seat for some in-flight movies, TV shows on my laptop, another meal and a bit more sleep before our arrival in Singapore many hours later.

There are a variety of reasons for Singapore's decision to retire the world's longest flights -- rising fuel costs, limited passenger loads, competition from other airlines with just one connection -- but a company spokesperson told me the carrier's official position is that Airbus offered a repurchase deal for the A340s that was too good to refuse. In exchange for returning the five planes to Airbus, the airline is able to grow its fleet of flagship A380 superjumbos, which are used primarily on flights to Europe and the US (via Tokyo and Frankfurt), at a significant discount.

Is a nonstop from Newark to SIN technically possible without the A340? Yes; Boeing's 777-200LR can travel that distance, but Singapore doesn't have that aircraft in its fleet. There's always a chance that the airline may add the extended-range Dreamliner, the 787-9, at some point, making the Newark route possible once again. But even so, I'd probably opt for a one-stop routing instead; 18 hours is simply too long to spend in one seat, and I'm no more eager to travel with an inflated carbon footprint than Singapore Air is to pay for the extra fuel. In fact, I had the option of returning to New York on nonstop Flight 22, but I instead opted for a routing through Delhi and Frankfurt on Singapore and Lufthansa, giving me a chance to stretch my legs every eight hours or so. And I'll do the same on future trips to Southeast Asia, without hesitation.

Flight 21's retirement is an unquestionable loss for commercial aviation, but with this sacrifice comes immense potential. Thanks to its smaller size and significant efficiency boost, the 787 enables reduced-load routes, like Denver to Tokyo or Houston to Lagos, Nigeria. And like the Dreamliner, the A350 will bring even more new direct flights, too, when that aircraft takes off in 2014. As for this nonstop to Singapore, if you're eager to spend upwards of 18 hours on the same plane and you have $5,000 burning a hole in your pocket, there's still time to snag one of the very last seats. The final flight departs tonight, so head over to the airline's site, pack your bags and become a part of history."

EADS said net profit for the July-September quarter rose to €436m (£366m), up from €301m (£252m) a year earlier.

The profit boost comes as EADS revised upward its estimate of Airbus orders for the year.

Net profit for the first nine months of 2013 rose by 36% to €1.2bn (£1bn).

The company now expects gross commercial aircraft orders for 2013 to reach more than 1,200 aircraft.

""We achieved a good improvement in revenues and profitability over the first nine months thanks largely to our civil aircraft business,"" EADS chief executive Tom Enders said.

But he warned that ""significant challenges"" lie ahead with respect to cash generation and the A350 XWB wide-body jet.

The A350 is being developed as a competitor to American rival Boeing and its troubled 787 Dreamliner.

Chief financial officer Harold Wilhelm said ""there's still a long way to go"" on the A350, with some higher costs, but that the programme remains on track for entry into service late next year.

The European jet maker said that its free cash flow, a measure of cash generated by a business, would be negative this year.

EADS estimated the negative figure for 2013 at €1.5bn (£1.25bn) because of investment into lifting production and development of programmes such as the A350 long-range wide body.

Previously, the company had said its free cash flow would break even this year, compared to positive €1.5bn last year."

Sale-and-lease back of the aircraft and using finance from the European Credit Agency are among the options, Chief Financial Officer Masakazu Arimori said in Tokyo Friday. Skymark aims to decide on financing by early next year and take delivery of its first Airbus plane in August or September, he said. The carrier will start flights to New York as early as December next year.

Keeping the A380 orders by Skymark is critical for Airbus as the plane-maker wants to make inroads in Japan, a market its rival, Boeing Co., has dominated as near monopoly for decades. Toulouse, France-based Airbus hasn't won a single firm order for the superjumbo this year, while lessor Doric Lease Corp. said Sunday that it will target Asian carriers for the double-decker plane because of a surge in travel.

""We don't want to put too much pressure on our cash flow,"" Arimori said. ""Almost all our profits are going to pay for the A380s.""

Skymark will need to invest ¥40 billion for the A380s next fiscal year, Arimori said. The Tokyo-based airline had ¥18 billion in cash at the end of September, according to a company statement Sunday. Skymark has already paid ¥12 billion for its first two of the six A380s it has ordered, Arimori said."
Flight Review: Flying Economy on an Hawaiian Airlines’ A330 to Auckland - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 06 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9mbGlnaHQtcmV2aWV3LWZseWluZy1lY29ub215LW9uLWFuLWhhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWEzMzAtdG8tYXVja2xhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getting to New Zealand from the United States is a very limited affair. The only way to get there directly is with Air New Zealand and at some times of the year (around Christmas, especially) capacity becomes limited due to operating only three daily flights (two from LAX, one from SFO).

More recently a new choice was offered to New Zealand; Hawaiian Airlines flying from Honolulu (HNL) to Auckland (AKL). The new flights started in March and they fly three times a week between the two cities.

Using their new Airbus A330-200 aircraft, Hawaiian’s service to the south Pacific allows one-stop service from a number of west coast cities (although all cities, apart from Seattle, require an overnight stay in Honolulu when southbound). After I had flown down to Hawaii from Seattle and spent a brief two hours in the warmth that permeates Honolulu airport, it was time to board another Hawaiian aircraft for my journey to New Zealand.

The average age of Hawaiian’s A330s is less than 2 years old and the interior reflects it. They operate with a two-class configuration with a total of 294 (18 first & 276 economy) seats. The 2-4-2 layout in economy is much more passenger-friendly compared to the 3-4-3 of the Boeing 777s that you may fly with many other airlines. The seats onboard are a slim-line design with 31/32″ of pitch and are actually quite comfortable for an eight-and-a-half-hour flight.

Seat-back AVOD and USB power ports (no normal power points for other devices, though) allows you to charge your phone or tablet so that when you touch down in New Zealand you’re not looking for the first bit of power you can find.

Normally a flight from Los Angeles to New Zealand can be around 12-13 hours (depending on winds) and usually they all depart very late in the evening. Essentially a red eye service as you try to sleep and you end up losing a day due to the International Date Line. Hawaiian’s option is a little bit different.

Our flight left HNL at around 1:30 pm and as we climbed off the famous ’œReef Runway’ at HNL we turned south, and headed towards the vast openness that is the world’s largest ocean, the Pacific. The first nice part of the departure timing is being able to see the amazing view outside the aircraft. The second is arriving to AKL in the late evening, only losing one day. This flight seems to reduce my jetlag quite a bit versus some other options.

As we climbed to cruising altitude, the crew went about the aircraft setting it up for our medium-haul flight. Being in economy isn’t so bad with Hawaiian Airlines as you get some little touches that other airlines don’t offer.

The first thing the crew handed out was a small amenity kit with earplugs, headphones, and an eye mask. They also passed out a menu for economy, yes you read that right’¦a menu in economy. Although the menu doubled as a postcard, it explained what was on offer for today’s meals and drinks. It may have been a small gesture, but that can go a long way for the passenger experience.

The first service was a drink of choice and a small bag of ’œPau Hana’ snack mix. ’œPau Hana’ means ’œwhen work is finished’ in Hawaiian and is not only the name of the snack mix, but also the entertainment system and the in-flight snack bar. It seems to be an all-encompassing term that Hawaiians use to describe relaxation.

Then it was time to check out the entertainment system. As I browsed through the options (the system was a little slow to respond at times) the selections were quite extensive, but one thing you have to be mindful of is that it is not all free.

The airline offers limited complimentary in-flight options, so you’re not going to go without entertainment if you do not want to shell out additional money. Of course, the USB charger means that you can watch things via your own device.

Your three choices include an on-demand movie at $8 each, unlimited TV, music and games for $7, and a kids package at $6. By far the best value to me would be the TV package. There is a very extensive selection of TV shows; I counted over 31 episodes of one series alone (Hawaii 5-0, funnily enough) so during your eight-to-nine hour flight you should not run out of things to watch. Like many other airlines, only credit cards are accepted.

After I got my entertainment set up, had my choice of drink, and the small snack mix, I settled in to my seat and we hit our cruise altitude of 38,000ft. Once leveled-off the crew began the first meal service. The lunch was small, fresh, and quite flavorful, which is something not often associated with a seat in economy. Although it was not the amazing seven-course extravaganza like the last time I crossed the Pacific, it was ample enough to keep me satisfied.

Our flight cruised on during the night and I avoided doing any work, choosing to use this as a rest (no sleeping though) flight and that way when we touched down in Auckland late in the evening, I would be tired enough to sleep overnight, refreshed and ready to hit the ground.

The Pau Hana snack bar staffed during the night allowed me to keep hunger at bay, and the constant crew passes through the cabin with water was a great touch as well. I did purchase some snacks while watching a movie and the range is distinctly Hawaiian in flavor, with plenty of local treats. I bought some Macadamia nut treats that were priced reasonably at $7.

Seeing the sunset finally catch up to us after we passed both the Equator and the International Date Line, we were two hours out from Auckland and people started waking up from their naps and were milling about the cabin.

The final meal service was described as ’œHigh Tea, Hawaiian Style’ and since that was the only description, it felt like a mystery. We had a smattering of turbulence around this point in the flight, so I have a feeling the final service was delayed a little due to the seat belt sign being on, but around 75 minutes out from Auckland the crew came around to serve the ’œHigh Tea’.

I was pleasantly surprised to be handed a small treat box and was again offered my beverage of choice. Since this was the final part of my Hawaiian flights I chose that uniquely Hawaiian drink, POG! Passion, Orange and Guava juice, or “POG” as it is known by frequent visitors and is served on all of their flights. This slightly-sweet, yet refreshing drink was an appropriate choice to finish off my Hawaiian experience; it was joined by a few treats from the islands (macadamia short bread and a macadamia chocolate).

As we descended into a rainy Auckland, we were informed that once we landed, the cabin would be sprayed by New Zealand Customs before we could touch any of our bags or even leave our seats, as New Zealand has strict entry requirements for pests and plant life. After enduring a long wait and a spraying that had a very different smell, we were allowed to disembark. Wishing the crew a quick Mahalo, I headed for immigration and my bed at a nearby airport hotel.

When heading to the south Pacific, one of the biggest things you have to combat is jet-lag. The best way to fight it is to reset your body to the local time zone – if that means you touch down at 6am and stay awake till 8pm, then you’re in for a hell of a long day. Hawaiian is a great to help with jetlag, as the daylight flight meant that after we touched down at around 10pm, by the time I made it to the hotel I was ready for a good night’s sleep.

This allowed me to wake up the next morning and actually be rested to explore New Zealand. A flight that has good service, good entertainment options, and gets you to your destination, safely, easily and without much hassle is always a good thing, Hawaiian ticked all those boxes, and then some.

Airbus A380 is the future of air travel: Emirates - Sydney Morning Herald,"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWlzLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtYWlyLXRyYXZlbC1lbWlyYXRlcy0yMDEzMTEyMC0yeHV0dS5odG1s0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS90cmF2ZWxsZXIvaW5zcGlyYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaXMtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1haXItdHJhdmVsLWVtaXJhdGVzLTIwMTMxMTIwLTJ4dXR1Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It also ended a dearth of orders for Europe's iconic double-decker jet. The apparent shortage of demand had fuelled internal discussion over whether to cut production and review A380 strategy, as reported last month. ""We were aware of it. But that was not the reason why we did this deal,"" Clark added. ""We wouldn't place orders of this size if we were concerned about it."" MAGIC NUMBER The new agreement was sealed in less than a week. ""They (Airbus) knew nothing about it until Monday last week. We gave them a call and said we want these airplanes and this is how we want to do it,"" Clark said.

""At the time, they were having issues with regard to what to actually do, slow production rate maybe."" Clark said he had always considered Emirates would need at least another 25 or 30 A380s for its fleet. ""So what we then did was to re-examine the real estate at the Dubai International Airport and see how we could use every trick in the book"" to fit in more planes. ""When we did that study, the magic number came up. So we said, let's have them in,"" he said, adding, ""we could have done another 10 if we found another bit of space somewhere in the (air)field."" Airbus officials said there had been preparatory talks for a few months, but confirmed that last week had seen a step-up in the pace of negotiations. Industry sources said the carrier had at first looked at something closer to 20-25 jets.

The sale does not immediately resolve a problem of what to do with an estimated five A380 aircraft remaining to be sold in 2015, for which the first parts must soon be ordered. The unallocated planes are worth some $US2 billion at current list prices, most of which is usually paid on delivery. Emirates is unlikely to take delivery of those planes since they do not fit its schedule for introducing a complex new in-flight entertainment system, which must be planned well ahead. Airbus has said it needs to deliver 30 aircraft in 2015 to meet its target of breaking even on the jet that year, but that any shortfall would not have a significant impact on profits. However, it could have a stronger impact on EADS' cashflow. Emirates and Airbus both expect traffic to grow fast enough in coming years to prove the A380's worth, but increasingly share an interest in ensuring the project succeeds. Boeing says airlines prefer twin-engined planes like its new type of 777."

How about a 16 foot long scale remote control model of a Airbus A380? That's more like it?

Sadly, it's a one off and isn't for sale. Built by Peter Michel, the model took “eight month, 5,000 working hours and a whole lot of Styrofoam and lightweight balsa wood” to get it into the air.

A video of it has gathered more than 2.7 million hits at the time of writing. You can view it below.

According to the video, the plane is 15.8 foot (481 cm) long and has a wing span of 17.4 foot (530 cm).

Unfortunately, as it is a one off, it isn't for sale. And even if it was for sale, it wouldn't be cheap. Each engine alone costs $3,300 (£2,025), and that is an uncustomised engine.

And that is without even considering running costs. The model has a 2.6 gallon fuel tank that burns through 0.3 gallons a minute. That's £18 to fill the tank. And even then, you'll only be able to run it for just over eight minutes. But that engine roar is totally worth it.

Creator Michel has not said how much it cost him to build the plane, but knowing the price of those four engines alone is enough to make us shudder.

Together, the Boeing and Airbus orders, excluding purchase rights, are worth an estimated US$99 billion at list prices. This is the largest ever aircraft order in civil aviation and also Emirates’ largest order announced at any event to date.

The agreement was signed at the Dubai Air Show by His Highness (H.H.) Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group, with Jim McNerney, Boeing Chairman, President and CEO, and Fabrice Brégier, Airbus’ President and CEO. The signing was witnessed by H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.

Emirates’ Boeing 777X order is the single largest aircraft order by value in the history of U.S. commercial aviation, and the additional A380 order cements Emirates, already the largest operator of this aircraft type, as the principal customer for the A380 worldwide.

Boeing said more than $95bn (£58.9bn) of its orders were for the 777X long-haul aircraft, making it the ""largest product launch in commercial jetliner history by value"".

Airbus totted up orders worth $44bn (£27.2bn), with Emirates placing the biggest by value, spending $20bn (£12.4bn) on 50 A380 super jumbos.

The total takings of about $145bn (£89.8bn) by the two rivals at Dubai were about twice those recorded at the Paris Air Show in June, when Airbus announced $39.3bn (£24.3bn) in orders and Boeing unveiled $38bn (£23.5bn).

Image: Boeing had a tough start to 2013 when its Dreamliners were grounded

Boeing's performance in Dubai was underpinned by demand for its new 777X, which was snapped up by Middle Eastern airlines.

Dubai's flagship Emirates placed an order worth $55.6bn (£34.4bn) for 115 777-9X aircraft, which is designed to carry more than 400 passengers.

It also ordered 35 777-8Xs, which have a capacity of 350 passengers.

Etihad Airways ordered 17 of the bigger model and eight of the 777-8Xs, while Qatar Airways bought 50 777-9Xs.

Boeing claims the aircraft, which is due to enter service around 2020, will be 12% more fuel efficient than the Airbus A350.

The brisk business the company enjoyed in Dubai followed a tough period for the firm in 2013.

Its 787 Dreamliner was beset by technical issues and was grounded worldwide for a time while battery modifications were completed to prevent over-heating.

In July, a fire aboard an Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner at Heathrow was linked to the plane's emergency beacon rather than the batteries at the centre of the previous probe."

New-generation Airbus incorporates key components made in South Africa - Creamer Media's Engineering News,"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lbmdpbmVlcmluZ25ld3MuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXctZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1haXJidXMtaW5jb3Jwb3JhdGVzLWtleS1jb21wb25lbnRzLW1hZGUtaW4tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLTIwMTMtMTEtMjnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On June 14, the first example of European manufacturer Airbus’ latest airliner family, the twin-engined wide body A350 XWB, made its maiden flight from Toulouse Blagnac Airport, in south-west France. (Throughout this story, the name Airbus means the airliner manufacturer and not the European aerospace group previously known as EADS, of which the airliner company is a subsidiary.) Designated MSN1 (for Manufacturer’s Serial Number One), it carries the registration F-WXWB and had a takeoff weight of about 221 t.

The flight lasted four hours and five minutes and the plane carried a flight test crew of six. They were Airbus chief test pilot Peter Chandler, A350 XWB project pilot Guy Magrin, A350 XWB project test flight engineer Pascal Verneau (who was in the cockpit with the pilots) and, at monitoring stations in the cabin, Airbus Flight and Integration Test Centre head Fernando Alonso, Development Flight Tests head Patrick du Ché and Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine lead flight test engineer Emanuele Costanzo.

“I congratulate the whole A350 XWB development team for having completed the first flight preparation in a record time,” said Airbus president and CEO Fabrice Bregier on the occasion of that first flight. “I also wish to thank the first flight crew today for taking this aircraft where it wants to be – in the sky. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all our teams in the design offices, at programme and manufacturing level, the ground crews, as well as our colleagues in airlines and suppliers and many others who helped define this all-new aircraft. The A350 XWB which has flown today, integrating the latest available technologies, is now entering the final stage of its development. And it is ready. Ready to head towards certification and entry-into- service in the second half of next year.”

SOUTH AFRICAN CONNECTION

Among those suppliers and manufacturers thanked by Bregier is a South African company, Aerosud. “That first flight was a morale booster,” reports Aerosud group MD Dr Paul Potgieter. The local company had a live TV feed from Toulouse for the flight, and nearly all the employees were able to watch. “Our people got to see what they’re contributing to. That was the nice thing – they felt part of it.”

Aerosud supplies critically important parts for the A350 XWB – the frame clips for the centre fuselage of the aircraft and the track cans for the wings. The frame clips are Class 1 structural composite parts and secure the fuselage skin panels to the fuselage structural framework. The track cans – there are several on each wing – house the drive mechanisms for the leading edge slats, which are a movable part of the wing.

“The A350 programme is very important for Aerosud,” he affirms. “The A350 contracts weren’t achieved or obtained on the back of offset agreements or country-level partnership agreements. Fundamentally, the roots of this were not developed through industrial participation. We’re moving beyond that. Industrial participation can be a lever, a means to fast-track, but not a necessity for us, to participate in the global aerospace market.”

“We got the track cans contract on the back of our previous experience,” he explains. “We do all the track cans for the Airbus A320.” The frame clips contract is the result of Aerosud’s concentration, over the last six years, on developing expertise in composites and, in particular, the manufacturing of parts from continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP), which are lighter than other composites. In this endeavour, Aerosud received support and some funding from the Department of Science and Technology, under the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Strategy. “We now have intellectual property (IP) on composites. Airbus has recognised our uniqueness in this.” (Aerosud imports its raw CFRTP material from Germany and the Netherlands.)

Aerosud designed and set up its first CFRTP parts production press in 2010 (a prototype press was developed in 2007) and the company is currently one of only a handful in the world that can supply CFRTP com- ponents. On the A350 programme, Aerosud is classified as a Tier 2 supplier. That is, it does not supply its products directly to Airbus but to US group Spirit AeroSystems, which is a Tier 1 supplier to Airbus.

Frame clips are not simple products. Those placed in different locations have different shapes and sizes, but all have the same curvature – the curvature of the fuselage diameter. Aerosud produces more than 470 types of frame clips for the A350. Each aircraft contains just over 1 000 Aerosud frame clips. The company is currently making some 1 800 frame clips a month, a figure that will increase to 9 000 a month by 2016, as pro- duction of the new airliner ramps up to steady state.

Aerosud continues to develop its CFRTP capabilities, with an eye to the future development of the A350 XWB programme, the Airbus Military A400M airlifter programme (in which the South African com- pany is a partner and Tier 1 supplier) and future projects. Earlier this year, it commissioned its new CFRTP press. Designed by Aerosud (with the heavy steel castings manufactured in China by HZM Heavy Engineering), this is the world’s biggest industrialised CFRTP press. It weighs some 70 t and will be able to produce CFRTP parts as big as 2.5 m × 1.5 m. And the IP belongs to Aerosud. This new ability to make much bigger CFRTP components “is an important capability”, points out Potgieter and could result in the local company getting additional work on the future variants of the new airliner family.

ALL NEW FAMILY

The A350 XWB is described by Airbus as a “midsize long-range product line” and is planned as a family of three versions, with the A350-900 being the baseline model, followed by the shorter A350-800 and the longer A359-1000. Between them, they will be able to convey between 276 and 369 passengers in comfortable two-class cabin layouts. As the baseline model, the A350-900 will execute the initial flight test programme and be the first version into revenue service next year. Currently, the A350-800 is due to enter service in late 2016 and the A350-1000 in 2017.

The second of five A350-900 flight test aircraft, MSN3, made its maiden flight on October 14. Up to November 12, MSN1 and MSN3 had jointly undertaken almost 120 test flights, accumulating close to 600 flight test hours. The remaining three test aircraft are all under assembly on the Final Assembly Line (FAL) at the Airbus complex at Toulouse Blagnac. The last of these, MSN5, is due to fly for the first time in the northern spring of next year. This will be the biggest fleet of flight test aircraft for one aeroplane type in the history of Airbus. This is to ensure that the programme is carried out as rapidly as possible.

The five test aircraft are programmed to execute a test programme totalling 2 500 flying hours. MSN1 will focus on developing the aircraft’s flight envelope and testing its systems and powerplant, in a series of flights that should total 800 hours. MSN3 is scheduled to accumulate 600 flying hours testing aircraft performance and, again, systems and powerplant. MSN2 will follow MSN3 into the air because MSN2 will be the first flight test aircraft fitted with a passenger cabin. It will fly 400 hours on cabin testing, development and certification missions. MSN4 is also scheduled for 400 hours of flight testing, focused on avionics development and certification.

Finally, MSN5, which will also be fitted with a full passenger cabin, will again be used for cabin testing but also for oper- ability evaluations, training, extended range twin engine operations testing and route proving.

As a new generation airliner family, the A350 XWB is manufactured mainly from com-posites. These account for 53% (by weight) of the aircraft and their big advantages are their combination of lightness and strength, their immunity to corrosion, and their effective immunity from fatigue (their fatigue life greatly exceeds the life of the other materials used in the aircraft). They are used to make the fuselage (except the cockpit area) – namely the frames, stringers and skin panels that, when put together, form the fuselage barrel sections – the tail cone, the wing centre box and keel frame, the wings, the tailplane and vertical fin, rudder, elevators, ailerons, flaps, and passenger and cargo doors. Aluminium and aluminium/lithium alloy make up 19% of the aeroplane (including the cockpit area), titanium, which is also virtually immune to corrosion, comprises 14% (in the landing gear, wing/engine pylons, door surrounds and high load frames), steel is 6% (mainly in the landing gear) and “miscellaneous” comes to 8%.

Designed from scratch, the aircraft enjoys highly refined aerodynamics, which reduces fuel consumption and increases range. It has a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 (that is, 85% of the speed of sound; the speed of sound varies with altitude, but the Mach number stays constant). It is fitted with advanced high lift devices (flaps and slats). Its systems are designed to be simple and efficient. Following Airbus’ long-established family concept, a single type rating will allow pilots to fly all three versions and there will likewise be a single qualification procedure for both the cabin and ground crews.

As the case of Aerosud shows, the supply chain for the A350 XWB encompasses the world. Major components, including some fuselage panels, are made outside Europe, but the major and final assembly work takes place within that continent. The forward and centre fuselage sections are assembled in Saint Nazaire and Nantes, France, the rear fuselage and vertical tail plane in Hamburg and nearby Stade, Germany, the horizontal tail plane in Getafe and Illescas (both in Spain), the wings in Broughton, UK, while the ailerons, flaps and slats are fitted to the wings in Bremen, Germany. The pylons are made in Toulouse, France.

Each of these major assemblies is fully integrated before they are despatched to the FAL. All of them are designed to be accommodated in Airbus’ own fleet of five Beluga outsize cargo aircraft, which fly across Europe collecting and delivering these parts, and major parts for other Airbus aircraft programmes. (The Beluga is a major redevelopment of the A300-600 airliner.)

Final assembly of the aircraft is in Toulouse. The A350 XWB FAL is in a new building, which has 22 000 m2 of photovoltaic panels on its roof. The power generated by these panels is equivalent to the amount of energy needed to light 83 000 m2 of offices. It is estimated that this building can produce 55% of its own energy and therefore avoid pro- duction of 150 t of CO2. Airbus is currently building a second FAL building for the A350 XWB. This new facility will be operational next year and will double the capacity of the FAL. This is part of the ramp-up to full production of the new aircraft. It has already been decided to build a dedicated extension for the A350-1000.

The company forecasts that the A350 XWB will have 25% lower operating costs and 40% lower maintenance costs than a current generation long haul wide body airliner. Both flight crew and cabin crew rest areas on the A350 XWB are so located (above the passenger deck) that they will have no impact on the revenue-generating volume. The flight crew rest area will have secure access from the flight deck and contain two bunks and a workstation. The cabin crew rest area, at the rear of the aircraft, will be secluded, have a dedicated changing area and up to eight bunks.

The aircraft is powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine. The famed powerplant manufacturer describes this as the most efficient aero engine flying in the world today. The latest version of the Trent engine family, the Trent XWB uses the most modern technology to reduce operating costs and will have the lowest carbon emissions of any engine used on wide body aircraft. Because it is derived from the preceding Trent 900 and Trent 1000 engines, its development was low risk.

Airbus forecasts a market demand over the next 20 years for 4 694 aircraft in the twin-aisle market, such as the A350-900 and A350-800 and for 2 085 aeroplanes in the A350-1000 category. As of the end of October, 764 A350 XWBs had been ordered by 39 customers. The manufacture of major parts for the first eleven production aircraft for commercial customers (MSN9 to MSN16) has already begun. The launch customer is Qatar Airways, which currently has 80 on order. Airbus has proposed the A350 XWB to South African Airways to modernise the local flag carrier’s long range fleet."

The air intelligence unit (AIU) of the customs department at Mumbai airport seized and sealed two aircraft — a Falcon 900 Ex and an Airbus 319

MUMBAI: The air intelligence unit (AIU) of the customs department at Mumbai airport seized and sealed two aircraft — a Falcon 900 Ex and an Airbus 319 — belonging to Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) for non-payment of duty.



Mukesh Ambani had gifted the A-319 luxury jet to wife Nita on her 44th birthday less than a year ago.



The two aircraft, together valued at Rs400 crore, belong to Reliance Commercial Developers Pvt Ltd (RCDPL).



Though both aircraft remain with RCDPL for safety and maintenance, they have been sealed and cannot be used till the duty and fine, totally amounting to Rs98 crore, are paid.



The customs says the two aircraft were imported via New Delhi to be rented out for charter flights. But they were only used privately.



Aircraft meant for private use attract duty at the rate of 18% and require an import licence. The rate for commercial use aircraft is 10%.

“An examination of the log book maintained by Reliance Commercial Developers Pvt Ltd, an RIL Group company, shows that the planes were used only privately and not hired out to any third party since arriving in India,” said a senior customs officer. “Hence we seized them.”



Both aircraft were seized and sealed by the AIU at their Mumbai hangars on Thursday night. They were later handed over to RCDPL for safety and maintenance. “We have issued them a show-cause notice,” said the officer. “They cannot use the planes till they pay the duty and fine.”



In a press statement, Reliance Industries said: “The authorities as a matter of routine procedure have sent out notices to several non-scheduled operators. As part of this routine, two Reliance Commercial Developers Pvt Limited aircraft were detained and handed back to the company thereafter. Reliance is fully complying with all procedures as notified by the concerned authorities.”



The aircraft were imported in November and December. The A-319 has a capacity of 180 passengers and is valued at Rs230 crore. The Falcon 900 can fly 14 passengers.

Mukesh’s gift had made headlines for its features like a bedroom, Jacuzzi, sky bar, and lounge. The Airbus was converted into a duplex residential facility with a large bedroom and living room."
"Airbus, Boeing sign Gulf supply deals - Times of Malta","Mon, 18 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L0FpcmJ1cy1Cb2Vpbmctc2lnbi1HdWxmLXN1cHBseS1kZWFscy40OTUzODjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing signed deals to buy some $5 billion of parts and materials from Abu Dhabi yesterday, in a sign Gulf states are seeking a reciprocal boost to their economies from the huge orders they placed with the planemakers the day before.

Gulf airlines, led by Dubai’s Emirates and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, struck plane deals worth almost $150 billion – or more, including options – on the first day of the Dubai Airshow on Sunday.

The buying spree underscored a shift in power in the aviation industry, as oil-rich, fast-growing economies of the Gulf take advantage of their strategic position between East and West to draw more travellers from hubs in Europe and Asia.

While the deals are a big boost to Airbus and Boeing, the world’s two dominant civil aircraft manufacturers, suppliers in Europe and the US are worried they will suffer from the growing globalisation of the aircraft supply chain, in which Gulf firms are playing a part.

Airbus agreed a new deal yesterday with Abu Dhabi’s state investment fund Mubadala to expand their partnership “for further composite and metallic aerostructure production in the United Arab Emirates, in addition to procurement of composite raw materials, worth $2.5 billion,” Mubadala said.

Reuters reported on Sunday the two parties were close to a deal.

Separately, Boeing said it had also signed a new deal with Mubadala for Abu Dhabi to supply as much as $2.5 billion in advanced composites and machine metals to the US planemaker.

Airbus shares jumped more than three per cent yesterday following Sunday’s slew of orders, which boost its A380 – the world’s biggest passenger jet which had been struggling for orders. Boeing’s orders boost its new version of the 777 jet.

The hub cities in the Gulf – Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha – are spending billions on infrastructure in a bid to attract travellers and diversify their oil-based revenues, at a time when faltering Western economies are struggling to invest.

Mubadala, which has a mandate to develop the emirate’s local economy, has sought to play a major role in the production of composite tail sections for passenger jets.

A group representing US airline pilots warned on Saturday the sale of hundreds of planes to Gulf airlines that compete with US carriers would have “serious consequences for the US economy and US airline workers.

Both Airbus and Boeing have already established partnerships with Strata, the composites manufacturing unit of Mubadala Aerospace which produces parts at Al-Ain near Oman."
Airbus worker in Broughton was crushed to death - North Wales Live,"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cG9zdC5jby51ay9uZXdzL25vcnRoLXdhbGVzLW5ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXdvcmtlci1icm91Z2h0b24tY3J1c2hlZC1kZWF0aC02MzA4MTUy0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtd2FsZXMtbmV3cy9haXJidXMtd29ya2VyLWJyb3VnaHRvbi1jcnVzaGVkLWRlYXRoLTYzMDgxNTIuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

An Airbus worker died after he was crushed between a tractor and a hopper as he came to the end of a 13-hour shift.

Donald Williams, 62, a highly experienced and much respected HGV mechanic at the Broughton factory, suffered a fractured skull in the accident. He also suffered fractured ribs, which could have been caused during attempts to resuscitate him, an inquest heard.

An expert told the inquest that Airbus workers often worked such long hours that fatigue was likely to result in errors and accidents, but it was unlikely that tiredness played a part in Mr Williams’ death in November 2011.

His wife Sheila told the inquest in Ruthin that the former motorcycle racer, who used to compete in the Isle of Man TT, loved his work as mechanics was also his hobby.

On the day of his death he had started work at 7.30am and, as he often did, was due to finish at 9pm after completing a second shift as overtime.

Stephen Shone, a driver/mechanic, told the hearing that Mr Williams, of Brunswick Road, Buckley , was working in the garage on a hydraulic hose linking the tractor to the hopper carrying material to keep the runways clear of ice.

Mr Shone entered the tractor cab and switched on the engine while Mr Williams stood behind the rear nearside wheel.

He pulled the lever to activate the system and raise the hopper then heard Mr Williams shout “Whoah” so pushed the lever back, and then saw his colleague trapped upright between the tractor and the hopper.

Other colleagues rushed to help and Mr Williams was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital, where he died.

Mr Shone and two other employees, Michael Shone – no relation – and Andrew Cartwright said that Mr Williams was very highly regarded and not a risk-taker.

All three said that it was common practice to work overtime though it was not obligatory and there was no pressure to do so.

Julie Bell, a specialist in the effect of working patterns and practices on wellbeing, said she had studied the timesheets of Mr Williams and others over a considerable period and compared them to the European Working Time Directive which states that employees should average no more than 48 hours a week over a 17-week period, with a minimum rest of 11 hours between shifts.

She said: “Whilst I have concluded that it is only possible that the working hours leading up to the accident could have contributed to the accident, it is clear that the company were not managing working hours effectively and there are many occasions in which the potential for fatigue risk is increased.

“The long days (up to 15 hours) worked by Mr Williams and Mr Shone combined with inadequate rest period for compensatory rest between shifts (down to nine hours) is of particular concern. At these times individuals are more likely to experience fatigue to the extent that they are more likely to make errors that contribute to accidents.”

Miss Bell continued: “Similarly, there were periods where Mr Williams worked a large number of consecutive shifts without the required 24 hours or 48 hours consecutive rest. This will have increased the risk of cumulative fatigue to the extent that errors are more likely.”

She concluded, however, that it was unlikely that fatigue had been a factor in the incident leading to Mr Williams’ death.

Andrew Crouch, an inspector with the Health And Safety Inspectorate, said the tractor was operating properly and it was possible that the hopper had risen, crushing Mr Williams, because the control had been in the “on” position when Mr Shone switched on the ignition.

The jury determined that Mr Williams’ death was misadventure, and North East Wales Coroner John Gittins said that after hearing from witnesses that some working practices had changed in the past two years he did not feel it necessary to submit a report to try to prevent future deaths."

Dozens of potentially deadly black widow spiders were discovered by Airbus workers as they unloaded goods at a factory in North Wales.

Forty-eight venomous spiderswere found stowed in a large consignment of components which had travelled to Flintshire from the USA.

It is thought that there had been originally two spiders but that they ‘procreated’ during the long journey overseas, the Daily Post reported.

The black widow’s relative, false widows, have hit the headlines in recent weeks following a spate of alleged sightings across the UK.

Both arachnids are usually found in damp and dark places, and live throughout the United States and South America.

Black widows get their name from the infamous mating ritual in which the female eats her partner.

Although the female's venom is potent and would require medical treatment, it doesn't usually kill healthy humans.

Airbus UK spokesperson Robert Gage said: “Airbus can confirm that a number of spiders were found in a consignment of components shipped into Broughton from the USA.

“We cannot be certain they were definitely black widow spiders but we believe they were and we treat every situation like this with utmost care because we wouldn’t want to take any chances.

“The spiders were contained, handled with care and the relevant authorities contacted to ensure they were dealt with appropriately.

“Fortunately, although it is not unheard of, these instances are very rare indeed.

“Obviously we will be tracking to find out exactly how it happened and measures have been taken to ensure items imported from overseas are fumigated to avoid situations like this.”"

The North Wales force said they are now working with the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) to establish what caused the plane to crash.

On-site firefighters from the nearby Airbus Broughton factory were first on the scene to deal with the incident.

Mr Vickers was pronounced dead at the scene and the woman was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died.

The runway at Chester Hawarden airport is next to the Airbus factory and manages business and private flights.

A spokesman for Airbus UK said the company was helping investigators piece together what led to the accident.

He said: “We are cooperating with the investigation team and it would therefore be inappropriate for us to comment fully at this stage. It did not involve an Airbus aircraft. The company would like to extend its sympathy to the family and friends of those who lost their lives.”

Airport owner Aviation Park Group Ltd said it could not comment on the crash and referred all queries to the police.

A spokesman for Flintshire Flying School said visibility was good at the time.

“It was at least about 8,000 metres and people were flying,” he said.

A spokesperson for the AAIB said if there is a need for any urgent safety advice to go out to the industry this can be issued within days.

But a final report into the incident could take between weeks and months to issue.

At the time of the crash the weather was cloudy and cold.

Eyewitnesses described how the aircraft “was coming in to land, flipped over and landed nose first”.

Engineer Owen Reid wrote on Twitter: “I was in the car park as it came in and saw the whole thing. It looked bad.”

Karen Hartley, 53, a nurse who lives near the airfield, said: “It’s very, very sad to think two people have lost their lives – what a terrible shock for their families.”

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: “I’ve worked for Airbus for the past 11 years and I can tell you something like this will be very upsetting for the workforce.”"

The deal was announced at the Dubai Airshow where on the opening day, three orders from Middle East airlines involving the full range of Airbus jetliner families were announced, potentially worth more than $47bn.Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, has ordered 24 A350-900 Regional, 16 A350-900 and 10 A350-1000 aircraft.The order takes the total number of Etihad A350 aircraft on order to 62, all powered by the Trent XWB.The Trent XWB is the fastest-selling member of the Rolls-Royce Trent engine family, with more than 1,600 ordered prior to its entry into service next year.Rolls-Royce's new Rotherham facility is currently under construction on the Advanced Manufacturing Park (AMP). The Advanced Blade Casting Facility will produce single crystal turbine blades, which play a critical role in jet engines and are required to withstand centrifugal loads of up to ten tonnes while operating at up to 200 degrees above the melting point of their alloy.There are over 65 turbine blades in every iconic Trent engine and the 14,900 sq m facility will be capable of manufacturing 100,000 blades per year when it becomes fully operational in 2014.The contract, including TotalCare service support, also sees Etihad order Trent 700 engines to power one Airbus A330 freighter.Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce engines powered the successful maiden flight of the Airbus A350 XWB. Airbus is bringing together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies in the A350 XWB to improve fuel efficiency, meaning that operating costs are 25% lower than its current long-range competitor.The Trent engine uses advanced materials, coatings, engine architecture, and cooling technologies to make it lighter, more aerodynamic and efficient. Whilst providing up to 97,000 lb. of thrust it has the lowest carbon emissions of any widebody engine.Also at the Dubai Airshow, Airbus' main rival, Boeing announced that its 787 Dreamliner received its 1,000th customer order when Etihad Airways announced an order for 30 787-10 Dreamliners, valued at $8.7 billion at list prices. Dreamliners are fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx engines."

Dozens of potentially deadly black widow spiders were discovered by Airbus workers as they unloaded goods at the Broughton factory.

Forty-eight venomous creepy-crawlies were found stowed in a large consignment of components which had travelled to Flintshire from the USA. It is thought that there had been originally two spiders but that they ‘procreated’ during the long journey overseas.

The black widow’s relative, false widows, have hit the headlines in recent weeks following a spate of alleged sightings across the UK.

Both critters are usually found in damp and dark places, and live throughout the United States and South America.

Black widows get their name from the infamous mating ritual in which the female eats her partner.

Although the female's venom is potent and would require medical treatment, it doesn't usually kill healthy humans.

Airbus UK spokesperson Robert Gage said: “Airbus can confirm that a number of spiders were found in a consignment of components shipped into Broughton from the USA.

“We cannot be certain they were definitely black widow spiders but we believe they were and we treat every situation like this with utmost care because we wouldn’t want to take any chances.

“The spiders were contained, handled with care and the relevant authorities contacted to ensure they were dealt with appropriately.

“Fortunately, although it is not unheard of, these instances are very rare indeed.

“Obviously we will be tracking to find out exactly how it happened and measures have been taken to ensure items imported from overseas are fumigated to avoid situations like this.”"

A man and woman were killed when the light aircraft they were flying in crashed near the runway at Hawarden airfield.

The man who was piloting the aircraft was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman was rushed by ambulance to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died from her injuries.

An investigation into what caused the twin engine light aircraft to smash into the ground shortly after 1pm yesterday was continuing last night.

It is the believed the plane was coming into land when disaster struck – no one else was on board.

Although three fire engines were sent to the scene it was on-site firefighters from Airbus who tackled the wreckage.

A police spokesman said they were not in a position to identify the victims and that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch was taking the lead.

He added: “We have officers at the scene and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch has been informed. A full investigation will be undertaken to establish the full circumstances.

“It’s not yet clear when formal identification of the deceased will take place and we are trying to contact next-of-kin. The coroner has been informed.”

A spokesman from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said: “We have deployed a team to investigate and are not in a position to comment further.”

Flights were stopped in and out of the airfield while accident investigators examined the debris strewn across the grass. A police helicopter hovered over the scene.

Airbus Asks Airlines To Please Stop It With The Super-Narrow Seats - Consumerist,"Mon, 04 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHA6Ly9jb25zdW1lcmlzdC5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS8wNC9haXJidXMtYXNrcy1haXJsaW5lcy10by1wbGVhc2Utc3RvcC1pdC13aXRoLXRoZS1zdXBlci1uYXJyb3ctc2VhdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shaving just a few inches off an airplane seat’s dimensions can make room for additional seats on the aircraft, but what do narrower seats do to passengers’ ability to relax during longer flights? The folks at French jet-maker Airbus say wider seats can result in more well-rested passengers.

Airbus is calling on airlines to make 18″ wide seats the standard for long-haul economy seats. As you can see from this SeatGuru chart, the majority of jets used for these flights have seats that are narrower than 18″, some as narrow as 16″.

While that small difference might not seem like much, Airbus claims that a study by the London Sleep Centre shows that passengers in 18″ seats enjoy a significantly better rest than those in 17″ seats. According to the study, passengers in 18″ seats reported a 53% improvement in sleep quality, falling asleep faster and staying asleep for longer periods of time.

“We’re arguing that one inch makes all the difference,” says the Airbus Head of Passenger Comfort, presumably between rounds of checking to see if you’d like a beverage or a pair of headphones. “That extra one inch basically allows you the wiggle room, allows the space around hips and shoulders and elbows so you are not in permanent contact with your neighbor.”

Airbus is making this push in advance of the expected 2014 release of its A350 jet, which it has designed around 18″ seats. But while the plane may be set up for these relatively luxurious seats, airlines may still order A350s with the narrower seats travelers are currently squeezing themselves into. As long as an airline’s seating request meets regulatory safety standards, Airbus will honor it.

In addition to narrow seats, airlines have recently turned to thinner seat-backs in order to squeeze additional seats onto jets. These seats are also lighter than existing airline seating to make up for the weight of the additional passengers.
