"Airbus' New Black Boxes Will Eject From Crashing Planes, So They're Easier to Find - WIRED","Tue, 04 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtbmV3LWJsYWNrLWJveGVzLXdpbGwtZWplY3QtZnJvbS1jcmFzaGluZy1wbGFuZXMtc28tdGhleXJlLWVhc2llci10by1maW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's been more than three years since Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 vanished, and after spending $150 million and scouring a huge chunk of the Indian Ocean, the international search effort has turned up just a few scraps of metal. It now seems likely investigators will never find the bulk of the wreckage nor the Boeing 777's black boxes, and as a result will never really know why it went down, or how to prevent it happening again.

Airbus says it has a solution: deployable flight data recorders. On large planes that frequently fly over water or remote areas, the European aircraft manufacturer will install a second, redundant black box near the rear of the fuselage, with a mechanical ejection system.

If the plane crashes into the ocean, the recorder will pop out to safety, floating and pinging away with an emergency locator transmitter, to help rescue teams find it and its valuable testimony about what went wrong. The ejection function is just one feature of Airbus' new black boxes (which are actually fluorescent orange), which are smaller and more capable than the current generation, able to record 25 hours of cockpit voice and data, up from the current two hours.

The recorder will only eject in the event of “major structural deformation” or submersion in six feet of water, which should reassure airlines that it won’t accidentally deploy in heavy turbulence or on hard landings. And the spring loaded mechanical system will be more palatable than earlier proposals for an explosive ejection system.

“The more digitized the airplane becomes, the more valuable that information is,” says air safety specialist, Christine Negroni, author of The Crash Detectives, Investigating the World’s Most Mysterious Air Disasters. She followed the search for MH370 in Malaysia, and says finding a data recorder would have made all the difference. “We would have had much faster and more specific knowledge, and a faster recovery to start picking stuff up. Now we may never know what happened.”

Deployable recorders would also have made life far easier for investigators after the Air France Flight 447 crash, in 2009. The Airbus A330 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. It took nearly two years to find and recover the black boxes—under 14,000 feet of ocean—which confirmed human error caused the crash, after the computer autopilot unexpectedly disconnected.

Recording 25 hours of data is a big help too, giving investigators much more information to work with. “People think the accident happens within minutes, that is not true,” says Negroni. Crashes are rarely simple, they’re usually the result of compounding factors that can start hours earlier, perhaps during maintenance, or even the previous flight.

After the loss of MH370, the International Civil Aviation Authority adopted a new standard requiring a plane to be capable of reporting its position at least every 15 minutes. In an emergency situation, that steps up to every minute. Plane makers are also investigating continual flight data reporting and using satellites to bounce info on a range of parameters back to an airline’s control center. But satellite uplinks, even if they’re high bandwidth, won’t replace the need for onboard recorders which monitor almost 100 sensors, computer inputs, switch positions, and flap locations, as well as a continual recording of voices through the pilots’ headsets and a cockpit microphone.

And even if all that data could be uploaded, duplicating it is even better. “I keep all my data in the cloud, but you can bet your butt I also have a portable hard drive,” says Negroni. In an industry reliant on redundancy for safety, wearing a belt and suspenders is a good thing.

The new recorders will be available in 2019, starting on the A350 jet and extending across the Airbus range from there. Hopefully, they’ll never be needed, but they’ll be there, just in case."
"Exclusive: Inside Airbus' modular plane concept, Transpose - The Verge","Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE3LzcvMTEvMTU5NDg2MDAvYWlyYnVzLW1vZHVsYXItcGxhbmUtcHJvamVjdC10cmFuc3Bvc2UtbmV4dC1sZXZlbC12aWRlby1sYXVyZW4tZ29vZGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There are the smartphones and laptops we use every day, and then there’s Next Level technology. In this new Verge video series, senior editor Lauren Goode takes you behind the scenes to show you the technology that’s being worked on at some of the world’s most innovative companies and research institutions. From modular airplanes to prescription video games to Hollywood’s attempt to hack your emotions, Next Level will show you the technology that has the potential to radically change the way we interact with tech.

Commercial flying is, for most people, a mediocre experience at best. Unless you shell out for an upgraded seat, you’re generally stuck with little leg room, tepid meals, and nowhere to go for hours or more — all for an average airfare of $350 in the US. Add in recent events, involving overbooking, passenger apparel choices, and dead pets, and the airlines aren’t exactly winning the hearts of customers right now.

This is the problem that Airbus thinks it can solve with Transpose, the wild modular cabin concept that it first revealed to the public last December. For the launch episode of our new video series Next Level, we got the exclusive first look inside A³, Airbus’ Silicon Valley labs, and experienced the modular cabin concept in a full-sized mock-up of an Airbus A330.

Transpose borrows its concept from cargo planes and applies it to passenger planes — the idea being that instead of loading goods into an aircraft, you could load modules with experiences onto the plane. All of this would happen in under an hour, according to the Transpose engineering team, and the mods would be prebuilt with experiences. These would range from coffee shops to co-working spaces, to day cares and spas, or even a cycling studio.

Jason Chua, a project executive at A³ by Airbus and the head of Transpose, says he envisions people moving freely around the plane like they would on a cruise ship, hopping from spot to spot rather than being crammed in their coach seats. “We want to make flying feel more human,” Chua says. “This could be your office, or a co-working space. The restaurant could be any restaurant. And so we want people to feel more at home when they fly, rather than trying to fit into something that isn’t designed for them.”

Airbus thinks it can turn the passenger plane experience into something more like a cruise ship

That all sounds great, but there are some potential hurdles to consider before Transpose actually... takes off. The engineering team still faces design challenges, as is pointed out in the episode. There are also the economics to consider: Chua says Airbus thinks these modular cabin seats would be priced at the premium economy level, but that’s if they maintain the same seating density as a standard aircraft; and ultimately, the airlines will determine pricing.

There’s also the not-so-small matter of regulatory approval. Transpose has said it hopes to have a Transpose-enabled aircraft flying “within a few years,” and that it has already entered into conversations with the Federal Aviation Administration. Rui Neiva, a policy analyst at the Eno Center for Transportation, thinks that may be an “aggressive schedule” given how strict FAA rules are, as well as international regulatory bodies. The FAA declined to comment on this specific project, but pointed out that the certification process can take anywhere from less than a year to more than five years, depending on the complexity of the project and the experience of the manufacturer.

At the very least, Airbus certainly has a lot of experience building planes. There’s some form of a precedent for this: in the 1960s, Boeing had a variation on the 727 that included a convertible “Quick Change” option, with seats and galleys attached to removable pallets. The 727 was in production for more than two decades.

“What’s novel about Airbus’ strategy is everything is modular,” says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group. “It could provide an airline with a more flexible way to reconfigure airplanes and meet market demand.”"

Airbus delivers its 100th A350 widebody jet

Airbus delivered its 100th Airbus A350 on Wednesday, handing over the milestone aircraft to customer China Airlines during a ceremony at the jetmaker’s assembly line in Toulouse, France.

“The 100th A350 XWB milestone comes as we reach our fastest widebody production ramp-up, on track to meet the target of 10 A350 deliveries per month by the end of 2018,” Airbus COO Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. “We are especially proud to deliver today’s aircraft to our long-standing customer China Airlines. The A350 is setting new standards for long haul air travel in terms of efficiency and comfort, thus being the perfect aircraft for China Airlines to expand its long-haul network.”

Airbus' inaugural A350 delivery was just in December 2014, when launch customer Qatar Airways became the world’s first carrier to take one of the jets.

Since then, Airbus has delivered A350s to a total of 14 airlines. Among the others that now have A350s in their fleets: Cathay Pacific, Finnair, LATAM Airlines, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.

In fact, it was a Singapore Airlines A350 that helped Airbus mark another milestone just this past October. That came when Singapore Airlines took possession of an A350 that Airbus commemorated as the 10,000th all-time aircraft to roll off its assembly lines.

In the USA, Delta took delivery of its first A350 earlier this month. American and United also have ordered the Airbus A350. However, each has since deferred their initial delivery schedules for the plane, raising uncertainty about the status of those orders.

Airbus sells 140 jets to China for $22.8B - UPI News,"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vVG9wX05ld3MvV29ybGQtTmV3cy8yMDE3LzA3LzA1L0FpcmJ1cy1zZWxscy0xNDAtamV0cy10by1DaGluYS1mb3ItMjI4Qi8zOTcxNDk5Mjc0ODk3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Beijing Capital Airlines Airbus A320 taxis at the Airbus Tianjin facilities in China on March 1, 2016.

July 5 (UPI) -- Airbus signed a contract with China on Wednesday to sell 140 jets for $22.8 billion. Chinese President Xi Jinping signed the agreement while in Berlin, Germany, ahead of the G20 summit, the European plane manufacturer said. State-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company purchased the planes and will allocate them to Chinese airlines over the next five to six years. Advertisement

Bloomberg reported the $22.8 billion sale is based on list prices of the planes.

""This is a great endorsement of our leading products in both the single-aisle and wide-body segments,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said. ""China is today one of the world's most important markets for aviation, and we are honored to support the development and rapid growth of China's civil aviation with our competitive product portfolio.""

By the end of May, Chinese operators had about 1,440 Airbus aircraft, including 1,230 A320 Family planes.

The agreement is for 100 A320 Family aircraft and 40 A350 XWB Family planes.

The A320 Family seats from 100 to 240 passengers and is the world's best-selling, single-aisle product line with more than 13,000 orders and more than 7,600 aircraft delivered to about 400 customers and operators worldwide, the company said in a release.

By the end of May 2017, the in-service Airbus fleet with Chinese operators totaled some 1,440 aircraft, of which nearly 1,230 are A320 Family planes.

The A350 is a twin-aisle plane.

Airbus produces narrow-body planes in Tianjin, east of Beijing, and the manufacture of the A320s will be split between that site and Europe, according to Enders.

Bloomberg reported talks are underway for China to more A380s, the double-deck plane that is the word's largest passenger plane. China Southern Airlines Co. has five of those jumbo planes, and they seat 506 in various classes, according to SeaGuru."

He also discusses the unit’s approach to airspace management and how it is looking to develop a comprehensive solution that will accommodate not just today’s aircraft but also drones and aircraft of the future. “We recognise that urban air mobility is more than just a vehicle, it requires an entire ecosystem and infrastructure to support it.”"
Mid-year production update at Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNy8yNy9taWQteWVhci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXVwZGF0ZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"July 27, 2017, © Leeham Co.: It’s mid-way through 2017 and LNC is taking its second look at production and delivery stream flows for the Big Four airframe manufacturers.

We examined Boeing Monday in advance of its earnings call Wednesday. Today we look at Airbus in advance of its earnings call today. We look at Bombardier and Embraer next Monday.

We use the Airfinance Journal Fleet Tracker as the basis for our exam.

A380

The A380 is in a very tenuous position.

Boeing finally threw in the towel on the 747-8I and the entire Very Large Aircraft sector in its 2017 Current Market Outlook (CMO) revealed at the Paris Air Show last month.

Airbus at the PAS revealed its study for the A380Plus, a series of aerodynamic and cabin configuration changes that have a goal of improving the economics by 13%. But even this is dependent upon whether the A380’s largest customer, Emirates Airline, buys into the program.

Two weeks earlier, Airbus revealed at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Assn. (IATA) that it is studying dropping the A380 production rate below the current 12/yr in 2019. Despite several questions, officials refused to say just what rate they are considering.

A review of Fleet Tracker enables some conclusions. We believe Airbus must drop the production rate to six or seven per year, given the dicey quality of the orders.

According to Fleet Tracker, Amedeo, Hong Kong Airlines (Unidentified on the Airbus website, but ID’d in Fleet Tracker), Qantas, Virgin Atlantic and Air Accord all are scheduled to received A380s in 2019. These account for six aircraft, out of 11 slated for delivery.

Amedeo has been deferring its orders, as has Virgin Atlantic and Hong Kong. Qantas previously indicated it didn’t want more A380s.

Emirates and Singapore are scheduled to receive five aircraft.

In 2020, Emirates is scheduled to receive seven and Singapore one. There are five others scheduled for delivery to the same questionable customers.

We expect Airbus and Emirates to adjust the delivery schedule slightly to smooth out production and Airbus to target a rate about half that of today. Airbus denied a report from a French media that the rate reduction will be to 8/yr. Perhaps there will be some information from the earnings call today.

A350

Nine A350-1000s are supposed to be delivered this year. Continued delays from suppliers hit A350-900 deliveries and, presumably, A350-1000s. LNC sees several A350s potentially slipping into next year. Regardless, inventory is being built up and next year’s deliveries exceed the production rate because of this–although Airbus plans to go to rate 10/mo sometime during the year. Inventory build up and deliveries the following year exceeding the production rate is not an unusual circumstance for Airbus, Boeing or other OEMs.

Deferrals appear to be opening early delivery slots. Airbus has an issue with the A350 in the USA. A softening of international traffic caused Delta Air Lines to defer some early A350s. Over at American Airlines, the A350 was ordered by US Airways. When this carrier acquired American, which ordered the Boeing 787, the surviving management (US Airways) found itself with two wide-body airplanes for the same mission. America’s 787s began delivering before the A350s, and AA deferred the latter.

Fleet planning on what to do about the A350s continues. Airbus and American are talking about down-grading the A350 to the A330neo.

At United Airlines, legacy UAL ordered 25 A350-900s. When Continental Airlines acquired United, the CO management upgraded these to the A350-1000 and added 10 orders. Later, Boeing offered United cheap ($120m range) 777-300ERs in its campaign to fill the 777 Classic skyline bridge to the 777X.

The A350-1000s were intended to replace the Boeing 747-400s. The addition of the 777-300ERs enabled United to accelerate this replacement. Now, the -1000s are an airplane that is duplicative to the -300ER. United deferred the -1000s while in discussion with Airbus over the future of the A350.

A330

With a production rate of 6/mo, Airbus has challenges next year.

According to the Fleet Tracker, Airbus has a production gap not only next year but going forward as well.

Further complicating: Hawaiian has the only six orders for the A330-800. John Leahy, COO-Customers, earlier said Airbus doesn’t want to even proceed with the -800, but has since reversed his position.

American Airlines appears more interested in the -800 than the -900 as replacements for the Boeing 767-300ER. Boeing is offering its own solution. AA selecting the A330-800 would be a way out of the A350-900. Pre-production on the A330-800 is underway.

Hawaiian has cancellation rights for the -800 and is said to have launched a competition between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350-900.

A320

Airbus’ hand-wringing frustration with Pratt & Whitney GTF-powered A320neos is well known and doesn’t need much recap here.

Delivery schedules are all bollixed up and may well go into next year to fully sort things out. The delivery scheduled in Fleet Tracker may or may not take these extraordinary events into account.

Setting this aside, Airbus is scheduled to deliver 585 A320ceo/neo family members next year and 718 in 2019. There’s a dearth of delivery slots until 2020-2021, and there aren’t a lot then.

That said, some moving around within the skyline could occur if some customers get pressed financially.

Qatar Airways is still showing up in 2018, but the industry knowns its mercurial CEO, Akbar Al Baker, wants to reschedule to a year or two later. Norwegian Air Shuttle, which is under pressure, is likewise a 2018 customer.

The A321 represents 35% of family deliveries next year, increasing to 41% in four years, based on current orders. But there is a lot of room left in the production to be filled. From a peak of 718 deliveries currently scheduled in 2019 (equal to 60/mo), the skyline drops to 545 in 2022.

Next: Bombardier and Embraer.

Even for big-ticket airplanes it is a massive booking.

European aircraft maker said on Wednesday it had sealed the agreement with China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS), which chief executive Tom Enders called ""one of the biggest contracts signed in a long time by Airbus.""

The deal covers 100 A320 single-aisle jets and 40 A350 wide-body aircraft.

""This underscores the strong demand by Chinese airlines in all segments, from domestic and low-cost to the regional and international long-haul market,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The company said a market analysis forecast a doubling of demand worldwide for planes with more than 100 seats to 40,000 aircraft in the next 20 years, fueled largely by demand from developing markets such as China.

A long time in the making

""In the mid-1990s we had a market share (in China) of five to six percent,"" Enders said. ""Twenty years later we have around 50 percent - we really put our foot on the gas.""

The European aircraft maker said its A320 line of planes was the world's best-selling single-aisle aircraft with more than 13,000 orders and 7,600 planes already delivered.

In January 2016, BOC Aviation, owned by Bank of China, announced an order for 30 A320s worth over $3 billion to meet growing demand.

At last month's Paris Air Show, Airbus announced 326 orders worth nearly $40 billion. However, it was outpaced at the event, one of the biggest annual sales bazaars in the industry, by Boeing thanks to its new 737 MAX 10 airliner, taking in a total of 571 orders for nearly $75 billion.

Underscoring the economic ties between Berlin and Beijing, Chinese and European companies - including German carmaker Daimler and the nation's industrial giant Siemens - signed a total of eight contracts this week.

President Xi Jinping was in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of the G20 summit starting Friday. His visit was part of a series of diplomatic meetings ahead of the meeting.

Hawaiian Airlines will expand its nonstop options between the state’s smaller airports and the U.S. West Coast. The Honolulu-based airline says the three new year-round routes will be enabled by the carrier's new Airbus A321neo jets, which are due to begin arriving to the company by the end of the year.

Hawaiian’s inaugural A321neo flight will be Jan. 8, when it begins flying the plane on its existing route between Oakland and Kahului on the island of Maui. Hawaiian is currently using Boeing 767 aircraft between those airports.

The first of the new year-round services Hawaiian is launching with the A321neo comes Jan. 18, when the carrier will start non-stop flights between Portland, Ore., and Kahului. Hawaiian’s second new A321neo route launches March 11 with a non-stop route connecting Los Angeles and Kona on the “Big Island” of Hawaii.

And on April 11, Hawaiian will put its A321neos into operation between Oakland and Lihue on the island of Kauai. Hawaiian already flies between those destinations, but it does so only on a seasonal schedule that's currently scheduled to end Sept. 4. When flights resume in April, Hawaiian says the A321neos will enable it to offer year-round service on the route. Currently, the Oakland-Kauai route is flown with Boeing 767 widebody jets, which Hawaiian has begun to phase out.

“The introduction of A321neo service to the Western U.S. heralds the dawn of a new era for Hawaiian Airlines and its guests,” Peter Ingram, Hawaiian’s chief commercial officer, says in a statement.

Hawaiian has ordered 18 of Airbus’ new A321neo, a next-generation update of the jetmaker's single-aisle model that competes against Boeing’s 737. Hawaiian has touted the new, fuel-efficient plane as a key component of a fleet revitalization plan now underway. In part, Hawaiian’s A321neos will help it phase out its aging 767 widebodies. Hawaiian also could use its efficient new A321s to pick up some routes currently flown by the carrier’s Airbus A330 widebodies, possibly allowing the company to redeploy those longer-range aircraft to new destinations in Asia, Australia or the U.S. East Coast. The A321neo also gives Hawaiian flexibility to open new routes between the Hawaiian islands and cities on the U.S. West Coast.

Hawaiian’s A321neos will seat 189 passengers. The layout includes 16 recliner business-class seats, 45 extra-legroom premium economy seats and 128 standard coach-class seats.

The three routes revealed this week mark the first publicly announced A321neo routes for Hawaiian.

“The A321neo offers an unrivaled combination of comfort and efficiency, allowing our guests to choose from three cabin experiences to customize their journey,"" Ingram says. ""We look forward to announcing additional routes in the months and years ahead.”

Collaborative development with German universities and institutes

Overberg, South Africa, 18 July 2017 – Airbus Defence and Space has successfully tested a new type of aircraft that will aid the development of future unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for series production. The unmanned jet-propelled demonstrator with the project name SAGITTA flew completely autonomously for around seven minutes over the test site in Overberg, South Africa, on a pre-programmed course. The innovative flying-wing construction demonstrated excellent flight characteristics during the test. This flight marked the successful completion of the first test phase, which also comprised an extensive series of ground tests.

The demonstrator is the product of the ‘Open Innovation’ / SAGITTA national initiative launched by Airbus in 2010. The project sees Airbus working together with institutes from the technical universities of Munich and Chemnitz, the University of the Federal Armed Forces (Universität der Bundeswehr) in Munich, the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences and the German Aerospace Centre DLR to jointly develop advanced technologies for unmanned flight. The project started with a feasibility study of the flying-wing configuration.

Criteria for the design included a high degree of autonomy, variable mission profiles and low levels of perceptibility. To achieve this, the inter-institutional research team adopted approaches from academic and industrial research, developed these further and incorporated them into solutions for industrial application. Airbus facilitated the continuous exchange between experts, doctoral students and developers during the development stage. In addition, the Company provided the industrial facilities required for integrating the technologies in the demonstrator at Airbus Defence and Space’s Military Air Systems Centre in Manching, Germany.

""With SAGITTA’s first flight, we have proved just how successful a cooperation between industry and academic partners can be in the area of basic research,"" said Grazia Vittadini, Head of Engineering at Airbus Defence and Space. ""We are increasingly shifting our focus towards these kinds of innovative concepts, in particular for the development of UAVs, so that we can develop products quickly and efficiently for a growing market.""

About SAGITTA

The research vehicle was constructed to a scale of 1:4 and measures 3 metres by 3 metres. It is designed as a flying wing and is powered by two 300 N turbines. Its maximum take-off weight is 150 kg. The UAV’s stealth properties are primarily a result of its shape. The airframe is produced completely from carbon fibre composite (CFC) using a number of new manufacturing processes. With the exception of the brakes, it is an ‘electronic flying device’ that is controlled by electromechanical actuators instead of hydraulic components. Even if the demonstrator isn’t a product destined for series production itself, Airbus Defence and Space and its development partners can nevertheless use it to gain important insights for new technologies in unmanned flight systems and to develop next-generation products to operational maturity.

Open collaboration with the best partners is allowing us to accelerate the future of flight. It underpins our approach in delivering new technologies and systems, fast.

Siemens

At our E-Aircraft Systems Test Lab, we have collaborated with Siemens to form a 200-strong team of curious and brilliant minds to advance engine technology that will enable radically more efficient propulsion systems. Our joint roadmap projects that a 100-seater hybrid-electric aircraft will be able to cover 1,000 km by 2030.

These aims are ambitious and cannot be achieved using conventional technologies. In combining with Siemens we are accelerating the development of various propulsion systems with power classes ranging from a few 100 kilowatts up to 10-plus megawatts, powering transformational projects from urban air mobility to international hybrid-electric flight.



Palantir

Technology partnerships work. In July 2015, we partnered Palantir to investigate potential solutions for value creation through production and aircraft data. The result was five projects, ranging from planning to predictive maintenance. Real-life data-driven solutions from this collaboration are now helping our industry grasp the transformative impact of digitisation.

Microsoft

Adopting innovative technologies to augment our teams is also a key area of focus. Our agreement with Microsoft gives us extended access to the HoloLens mixed reality headsets before their commercial release. The technology brings virtual objects into the physical world, making them appear and behave as solid objects. This has huge potential for disruption and so we’re using this partnership to rapidly understand its potential impact and benefits to the aerospace industry.

The collaboration has already brought tangible solutions at different stages of the production process, from planning to testing.

Bringing mobility and new ways to connect users to digital information could significantly speed up decision-making. Our partnerships will get us there sooner."
Airbus scores British military satellite deal without competition - Defense News,"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zcGFjZS8yMDE3LzA3LzMxL2FpcmJ1cy1zY29yZXMtdWstbWlsaXRhcnlzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1kZWFsLXdpdGhvdXQtY29tcGV0aXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The first element of a new British military satellite communications capability to replace the current Skynet 5 network has been awarded to Airbus Defence and Space without a competition.

Negotiations to complete the deal to supply the Skynet 6A satellite are ongoing, but the British Ministry of Defence said it opted for the noncompetitive route with Airbus, in part, to maintain domestic space capabilities.

“The MoD intends to award Airbus Defence and Space the single source contract for the manufacture, assembly, integration, test and launch of a Skynet 6A geostationary military communications satellite. This will secure delivery of a sovereign and secure capability for the U.K.,” said a department spokesman.

The ability of Airbus to meet the required delivery timeline for Skynet 6A also influenced the decision, said officials here.

The new spacecraft is being acquired to fill a potential capacity gap as early satellites in the U.K. military’s Skynet 5 constellation approach the end of their useful lives ahead of a new generation of communications capabilities becoming available around the end of the next decade.

The new satellite is expected to be operational by mid-2025.

A spokesman for Airbus in the U.K. said the company is “not going to comment on the award at this stage.”

Airbus is the incumbent supplier of satellites to the British military, having built four Skynet 5 spacecraft that were launched between 2007 and 2012 as part of a 20 year, £3.6 billion (U.S. $4.7 billion) private finance initiative, or PFI, with the British MoD to acquire and operate the platforms and ground stations.

The PFI deal, which has been extended, is due to expire in 2022 when the satellites and ground infrastructure are handed over to the MoD by Airbus in exchange for a pound.

The Skynet 6 program is packaged into three elements: the stopgap spacecraft to be built by Airbus, a service delivery package to manage ground operations from 2022 and an enduring capability program to provide future communication system capacity beyond the end of the next decade.

In an effort to fend off expected criticism from satellite builders denied a chance to secure a toehold in Britain’s growing space business, MoD officials said that the default position on the two future, and larger, parts of the Skynet 6 program would be competitive.

A third, smaller competition to appoint an acquisition partner to act as the customer’s friend in the Skynet 6 procurement is also expected to move forward in the near future.

Officials said they expect a competition to appoint a new service delivery partner to take over the running of the ground operations from 2022. The enduring capability is also in line to be competed as things stand.

The final part of the Skynet 6 requirement will be the introduction of a future enduring communications capability, which will partly be provided by satellites.

Other innovative and cheaper systems, like the Airbus Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft, which fly on the edge of space, may also be in the mix.

The British military has already ordered three Zephyrs for evaluation.

Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space have been lobbying hard to challenge the dominance of Airbus here, and all three companies were pitching for a competition on Skynet 6A.

The three companies, along with Airbus, responded to an MoD capability questionnaire last year, and British officials have visited satellite facilities in the U.S. and Europe to assess security, the ability to meet sovereignty and U.K. industrial base requirements as well as other issues ahead of making the decision in favor of Airbus.

Airbus is Britain’s largest satellite systems supplier, but foreign rivals, particularly Lockheed Martin, have set their sights on securing a larger part of a fast-growing space business here.

Pilotless aircraft, flying electric vehicles and bespoke air cabins are the future of flight, Airbus said Thursday.

Paul Eremenko, the European plane-maker's chief technological officer, painted a picture of skies buzzing with new flight forms at the RISE tech conference held in Hong Kong.

Airbus is already testing out what it calls a ""module"" cabin concept—passenger planes being tailored to different demands.

""You can imagine on a flight to Vegas, you might have a casino module,"" said Eremenko.

""Or in a more general sense, you may have a sleeping module and you go and pay 50 bucks an hour to have the ability to sleep in a sound-proof, climate-controlled area,"" he added.

Eremenko said Airbus had been working on the project for a year already, including user trials.

Airbus has also been working on a self-piloted flying car, the Vahana, with testing on a full-size prototype to be done by the end of the year.

""Our goal really is to open up the third dimension in cities and we believe that the time is right,"" said Eremenko, describing the growth of mega-cities, increasing congestion and technological developments as factors fuelling the development of electric short-hop flight travel.

Pilotless flight was also on the cards, he said, playing down safety fears.

""We believe the first autonomy will come in the domain of urban air mobility where the vehicles are smaller and there are fewer occupants,"" he said, adding it was easier to fly autonomously than to drive autonomously.

""That, I have fairly high confidence that we will get to in single-digit years,"" he said, adding the problem was not a technical one but of social acceptance.

Artificial intelligence was the main focus of the sprawling RISE conference, which Wednesday included a debate between two lifelike disembodied robot torsos on the future of humanity.

Airbus group 2Q results: Engine deliveries decides 2017 results. - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNy8yNy9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtMnEtcmVzdWx0cy1lbmdpbmUtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1kZWNpZGVzLWFpcmJ1cy0yMDE3LXJlc3VsdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

July 27, 2017, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus Group presented its 2Q2017 results this morning. The result for the first half and the full year of 2017 is decided by A320neo engine deliveries.

Out of a planned 200 A320neo deliveries for the year, Airbus could deliver 54 aircraft during the first half, with 35 completed aircraft waiting for engines on the Airbus tarmac.

Group results

The Airbus revenue and profit for 1H2017 was down to €28.7bn (€28.8bn) and €1.1bn (€1.7bn), partly because of divestment of Defense electronics in the period.

Commercial aircraft dominates the group with 75% of revenue, at €21.8bn. The helicopters business has made progress with sales picking up and a lifted ban on Super-Puma (H225) flying from Norway and UK. Revenue was €2.6bn.

Defense is business as usual at revenue of € 4.6bn, except for the group’s problem child A400M. Harald Wilhelm, the group CFO, cautioned that needed write-offs could be as large for 2017 and 2018 as for 2016 (€1bn). It all depends on the ongoing negotiations with the A400M customer group.

Group guidance for 2017 was reissued but with a clear caution that it will depend on A320neo engine deliveries catching up.

Aircraft programs

A320

Airbus planned to deliver 200 A320neo during 2017. This is still the target after a first half with only 54 deliveries. The problem is Pratt & Whitney (PW) cannot deliver engines to Airbus at the same time as it changes engines with issues in the field.

The Pratt & Whitney engine issues are under intense rework. Airbus said they will judge the GTF readiness for service by the airlines’ experience rather than PW’s assurances.

The successful delivery of 200 A320neo for 2017 will depend on PW’s delivery capability.

CFM’s LEAP engine deliveries are on plan and the engines experience a normal level of teething problems in service.

A330

The engines for the A330neo are now in Toulouse, with first flight scheduled after summer holidays in September. A330ceo deliveries are running to plan at six per month.

A350

The deliveries are running well with a fast reduction in traveled work. The hiccup in the quarter was the outright cancellation of four produced Qatar Airways A350-900.

Talks are ongoing with Qatar regarding the fate of the aircraft. Solutions could be revised pricing and subsequent delivery, or rescheduling (and reequipping) of the aircraft for another customer.

The four finished aircraft stays in inventory and are therefore missed in cash flow, revenue and profit for the quarter.

Flight tests of A350-1000 is progressing well. First delivery is end of year as planned .

A380

Airbus will lower the production rate from 12 aircraft per year to eight by 2019. The lower production rate “will not materially affect Airbus results” according to Wilhelm. Intense work is ongoing to reduce the fixed costs of A380 production.

A400M

Eight (six) A400M were delivered during 1H2017. Airbus says the negotiations with the six Nations customer organization OCCAR are held in a constructive atmosphere. No negotiation results were revealed. Further write-offs will depend on negotiation results.

Delta Air Lines has become the first carrier in North America to take delivery of Airbus’ new A350 widebody jet.

The Atlanta-based airline officially took possession of its first A350 on Thursday at the Airbus assembly line in Toulouse, France. The A350 is the first of 25 that Delta has ordered. The company expects to have five A350s in its fleet by the end of the year and 15 by the end of 2018, according to FlightGlobal.

Delta will use its A350s to help phase out its Boeing 747 jets, which the carrier plans to retire later this year. Delta’s A350s will be configured with 306 seats, including 32 of its new “Delta One” business-class suites and 48 of its new international-style “Premium Select” premium economy seats.

Delta will base its first A350s at its Detroit hub, where they’ll fly routes to Asia. Delta’s first announced A350 route is Detroit-Tokyo Narita; the airline’s A350s will begin taking over flights on that route beginning Oct. 30.

“The Airbus A350 sets a new standard of flying experience for our customers, representing years of product innovation as Delta continues to transform into a leading global carrier,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “Our new flagship A350 fits well in Delta’s long-haul network, combining an exceptional customer experience with strong operating economics and fuel-efficiency as we retire older, less-efficient aircraft.”

With the delivery, Delta becomes the first North American airline to take delivery of the A350. South American carrier LATAM Airlines took its first model of the jet in 2015. Qatar Airways was the world’s first carrier to take the jet, receiving its first A350 in 2014.

In the U.S., American and United also have ordered the Airbus A350. However, each of those airlines have deferred their orders for the plane, raising uncertainty about the status of those orders.

UK and Norway CAA to lift Airbus H225 grounding - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdWstbm9yd2F5LWNhYS1saWZ0LWFpcmJ1cy1oMjI1LWdyb3VuZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The latest improvements Airbus Helicopters has added to the H225 (EC225 LP) and AS332 L2 seem to have convinced the civil aviation authorities (CAA) in the U.K. and Norway, with both announcing their intention to reauthorize operations with the two Super Puma types. Operators will have to present a safety case proving they performed the required modifications and their technicians are trained and equipped for the new maintenance procedures.

“We would not have made this decision unless we were convinced that the changes to the helicopters and their maintenance restore the required airworthiness standards,” John McColl, head of airworthiness at the UK CAA, said.

In October, the European Aviation Safety Agency had lifted the grounding that followed the fatal crash of an H225 near Turoy, Norway, in April 2016. The airframer had modified the inspection program for the main gearbox and, for one of the planet gears, eliminated a supplier. But the Norway and the U.K. CAAs had not lifted their own grounding directives.

Among the new measures that will allow the helicopters to fly again in these two countries is the introduction of a new “full flow magnetic plug” to detect particles in oil. The new device is located at a critical point in the oil system – upstream to the oil cooler – and will contribute to ensure every particle is detected. It will “see” the entire oil flow and will prevent particles from being trapped in the oil cooler, as happened in the accident helicopter. The additional plug will simultaneously alleviate maintenance needs, which had been made highly time-consuming.

The global fleet of AS332 L2s and H225s (including military versions) comprises 346 aircraft, half of which are flying. However, out of the 160 helicopters in offshore oil-and-gas operations, only 15 percent have returned to service, according to Airbus Helicopters’ numbers."

Tailored for orthorectification of high and very high resolution optical and radar satellite data, WorldDEM4Ortho will enable corrections of all distortions induced by the topographical variations of the Earth’s surface and satellite orientation when acquiring an image. Covering the Earth’s entire land surface, WorldDEM4Ortho is the most consistent and accurate elevation model for orthorectification on a global scale.

Without these geometrical corrections, satellite images cannot be used in Geographical Information Systems or for any mapping related applications. With the huge development of new geolocated applications like business analytics, location-based services or tourism, the needs for such a consistent and precise elevation model are exploding.

WorldDEM4Ortho is based on the global WorldDEM dataset. It is produced via a fully automated process and features a vertical accuracy of four metres in a 24 metre raster. Identified disturbing terrain artefacts are removed. Bodies of water like lakes or sea are flattened. Rivers are stepped with a flow that follows the surrounding shorelines. Adaptive smoothing processes are also applied to different landscapes and land-use such as urban areas to avoid distortions in the orthorectified image.

Airbus BizLab announced the successful culmination of its second season through a flagship event in Bengaluru. At the event, the start-ups who were selected to work with different Airbus teams in India and across the world over the last six months showcased their concept models and ideas of transforming the aerospace sector.

The season two was launched in January 2017 in the presence of the then French Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Jean-Marc Ayrault. It had received 137 applications from nine countries. All the five selected start-ups – Neewee, Stelae Technologies, EFLIGHT, SYmbosim and Qualitas Technologies have today either started working with Airbus or are associated with the aerospace sector.

The event was attended by Bruno Gutierres – Head of Airbus BizLab, Pierre de Bausset – President and MD at Airbus India, Srinivasan Dwarakanath – President, Commercial Aircraft at Airbus India and Siddharth Balachandran – Airbus BizLab Leader, India. The importance of B2B start-ups across various sectors was also discussed over a panel discussion.

Commenting on the success of the second season, Bruno Gutierres said, “We are thrilled to have worked with such exciting start-ups in season two. It is re-assuring to see the potential and quality of entrepreneurs in the Indian start-up ecosystem. We are hoping to create more opportunities for start-ups to work in the aerospace and defence sectors.”

Apart from working with the start-ups in the cohort, Airbus BizLab in India will soon be launching a community of B2B start-ups working in areas such as Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Electric Propulsion, Factories of the Future, Space Tech & Solutions, Image Processing, Cyber Security, IOT & Robotics.

Elaborating the importance of the community Siddharth Balachandran said, “Every season we can accelerate only five or six start-ups but we keep receiving adhoc requests from Airbus teams globally checking if we have a start-up working on a specific problem that they face. So, from now on, we will have a ready pool of registered start-ups in the community to pick from. We will also organize regular events for the community to help these start-ups better understand the world of Aerospace & Defence.”

Bizlab is a part of Airbus’ innovative strategy to bring together start-ups and Airbus “intrapreneurs” to work and speed up the transformation of their innovative ideas into valuable businesses. Through its six month “acceleration programme” for early stage projects, Airbus Bizlab gives access to a large number of coaches, experts and mentors in various domains.

The call for applications for Season three in Bengaluru is now open and BizLab is inviting interested B2B startups to apply for the acceleration program."

No matter the programme, function, product, working method or even cooperation model, there is always room for improvement. And that is a good thing. While innovation is a state of mind, it is also a key driver in the helicopter industry, which must constantly strive to reinvent itself in order to satisfy its customers. Airbus is committed to setting new standards in the helicopter industry, both by improving the existing range and thereby offering safer, greener and more efficient helicopters, and by coming up with groundbreaking ideas in response to the future challenges of the 21st century.

“If we are to survive in the helicopter market of the next few decades, we must start anticipating our customers’ future needs, even if it means taking risks.” Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Helicopters Head of Engineering, explains how the company goes about the task of staying one step ahead.

Today’s helicopter industry is beset by uncertainty. What role can innovation play in aiding its development?

Jean-Brice Dumont : Though these are anxious times for the company – in the face of increased competition – we stick firmly to our policy of investing in innovation and R&D. Our road map is still the same: to operate in the present while also continuing to prepare for the medium- and long-term future. Our goal at this moment in time is to improve our existing helicopters, which we depend on to make our living, while also remaining true to our core values, the first of which is safety, followed by customer satisfaction, quality and the competitiveness of our products. Innovation remains a key driver in the life of our range. At the same time, however, we must prepare for the long term. And that requires courage and clear vision on our part because our environment is growing increasingly complex by the day. Technologies are evolving at a tremendous rate, as is the helicopter market. Failure to anticipate those developments means failure to survive,which is why we invest so much effort in R&D in response to the market downturn.

What is your priority when it comes to innovation?

J-B. D.: Safety first and foremost! But innovation is not effective if it is unable to satisfy customers by offering them genuine added value. Take a look at the H160. Some technologies are easy to spot, such as the new rotor, the new design for the doors and emergency exits and the very high level of sound and vibration control. But there are others that are not so visible, such as the roll-out of an innovative industrial process that allows us to cut cycles, reduce costs and to facilitate mass customisation. Our range of services has also been extensively modernised, a process that has drawn in particular on new digital technologies. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do, including the ways in which we work. It is part of our DNA.

Is being innovative enough? Do you have to be visionary too?

J-B. D.: You do have to be visionary and stay on your toes. Let’s take urban mobility as an example. This is an area that Airbus is monitoring closely. The CityAirbus flying taxi demonstrator that we are working on is an original solution for the future, one with the potential to revolutionise the way in which the inhabitants of major conurbations get around. Their dream is to escape the hazards posed by gridlocked streets. We are playing an active part in studies into this topic, working on the transporter, powerplant, operations and the business model. In terms of drones, we are looking at every possible avenue. We are, for example, working with the Singaporean authorities on an experimental project called Skyways, which seeks to develop an unmanned aircraft system for delivering packages in urban environments. We have also reached a very advanced stage with the VSR700, a military drone developed in conjunction with Hélicoptères Guimbal. Another concept we firmly believe in is the speed capability of the Clean Sky 2 demonstrator, the successor to the X3, known as Racer. The technical solution we have put forward is very appealing because it is simple and inexpensive. It is an illustration of perfect innovation, which is innovation based on reality."

Future of Airbus A380 superjumbo said to hinge on Emirates order - Salt Lake Tribune,"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3LzA3LzI0L2Z1dHVyZS1vZi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLXNhaWQtdG8taGluZ2Utb24tZW1pcmF0ZXMtb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE - In this June 18, 2015 file photo, an Airbus A380 takes off for its demonstration flight at the Paris Air Show, in Le Bourget airport, north of Paris. Airbus announced Wednesday Jan. 11, 2017 that it delivered 688 planes over the year, primarily in the single-aisle A320 family, compared with 635 in 2015.

Airbus is working on vital sales campaigns aimed at extending the life of its flagship A380 superjumbo, with outgoing marketing chief John Leahy seeking to secure orders by the Dubai Air Show in November, people familiar with the matter said.

Key to the push is a requirement for 20 jets worth $8.7 billion at leading A380 customer Emirates, with follow-on orders from British Airways owner IAG, Japan's ANA Holdings and Thai Airways International also in the mix, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the talks are private.

Airbus may not feel that it can proceed with the smaller sales, likely to be for five to 10 planes apiece, without the Emirates deal to bolster the backlog, the people said. In the absence of new orders the company is set to pare output to less than one A380 a month, most likely sounding the death knell for the jet amid a dwindling order backlog, and could detail the envisaged cut in an earnings update this week, they said.

A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment ahead of the financial report, which the Toulouse, France-based company has scheduled for Thursday.

Boeing has already said that it could end production of the rival 747, where the rate has been reduced to just one plane every two months, so that the current backlog will last almost four years. At the same time the jumbo is also offered as a freighter, giving it a wider potential market than the passenger-only A380.

Landing a life-extending deal for the A380 would help cap the career of Leahy, 66, who announced in May that he'd be stepping down after 23 years as marketing boss and more than $1 trillion in sales. The American remains adamant that fast-growing markets will favor the A380 in years to come if it can be kept going, and is holding off on his departure to focus on the Emirates talks, one person said.

Emirates is evaluating an upgraded version of the superjumbo unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June and dubbed the ""A380 plus."" The design adds fuel-saving winglets, which combined with an already-announced layout revision carrying 80 more passengers would shave 13 percent from per-seat costs, though Tim Clark, the airline's president, says he doesn't need extra berths.

Airbus's head of programs Didier Evrard said in May it would decide by the end of this year whether to reduce production of the A380 -- which has a list price of $436.9 billion -- to fewer than 12 jets a year. A failure to get the Emirates deal done could see output fall to a 0.7-a-month equivalent rate, a figure reported by France's Challenges magazine Thursday.

The planemaker may still be forced to cut the A380 rate even with a follow-up order from Emirates if the airline opts to take the jets at a later date because of overcrowding at its Dubai hub, though Clark has suggested the planes would most likely replace older superjumbos coming off lease from 2020.

Even the move to one plane a month, known as ""rate one"" and currently due to take effect from 2018, was widely viewed as the beginning of the end for the struggling A380 program when it was announced last year, though Airbus says that it's able to break even at that production level on a per-plane basis.

The company has handed over 213 A380s to date, including 28 last year, to 13 customers. Of the remaining 104 still listed in the official backlog, as few as 57 could actually be delivered, according to Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, representing less than five years of production at one plane a month. That includes 47 for Emirates."

Successful Test of Airbus Defence and Space's SAGITTA UAV on South African Test Range - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNy8wNy9zdWNjZXNzZnVsLXRlc3Qtb2YtYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWNlcy1zYWdpdHRhLXVhdi1vbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2FuLXRlc3QtcmFuZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2017-07-22 According to our partner defenceWeb in a piece published on July 18, 2017, the Overberg test range has hosted its first flight of a jet-propelled UAV.

Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) used Denel’s Overberg Test Range (OTR) for the successful testing of a new aircraft type that will aid development of future unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for series production.

The unmanned jet-propelled demonstrator with the project name SAGITTA flew completely autonomously for around seven minutes over the test site in South Africa’s Southern Cape, on a pre-programmed course.

The innovative flying-wing construction demonstrated excellent flight characteristics during the test according to an Airbus statement.

This flight marked the successful completion of the first test phase, which included an extensive series of ground tests.

The demonstrator is the product of the ‘Open Innovation’/SAGITTA national initiative launched by Airbus in 2010.

The project sees Airbus working with institutes from the technical universities of Munich and Chemnitz, the University of the Federal Armed Forces (Universität der Bundeswehr) in Munich, the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences and the German Aerospace Centre DLR to jointly develop advanced technologies for unmanned flight.

The project started with a feasibility study of the flying-wing configuration.

Criteria for the design included a high degree of autonomy, variable mission profiles and low levels of perceptibility.

To achieve this, the inter-institutional research team adopted approaches from academic and industrial research, developed these further and incorporated them into solutions for industrial application.

Airbus facilitated continuous exchange between experts, doctoral students and developers during the development stage.

Additionally, the company provided industrial facilities needed for integrating the technologies in the demonstrator at Airbus Defence and Space’s Military Air Systems Centre in Manching, Germany.

“With SAGITTA’s first flight, we proved how successful co-operation between industry and academic partners can be in the area of basic research,” said Grazia Vittadini, Head of Engineering at Airbus Defence and Space.

“We are increasingly shifting our focus towards these types of innovative concepts, in particular for the development of UAVs, so we can develop products quickly and efficiently for a growing market.”

The SAGITTA research vehicle was constructed to a scale of 1:4 and measures 3mX3m. It is designed as a flying wing and is powered by two 300 Nm turbines. Its maximum take-off weight is 150 kg.

The UAV’s stealth properties are primarily a result of its shape.

The airframe is produced completely from carbon fibre composite (CFC) using new manufacturing processes.

With the exception of the brakes, it is an “electronic flying device” controlled by electro-mechanical actuators instead of hydraulic components.



Even if the demonstrator isn’t a product destined for series production itself, Airbus Defence and Space and its development partners can use it to gain insights for new technologies in unmanned flight systems and to develop next-generation products to operational maturity.

According to the DLR Institute of Flight Systems, Sagitta is part of an open innovation approach to unmanned aerial technologies.

The project SAGITTA is led by Airbus Defence & Space and has the goal to further develop existing UAV technology to a higher maturity level.

To reach this several PhD students from different research institutions working on relevant research topics.

The project team includes the Technical University Munich, the University of the German Armed Forces in Munich, the University of Applied Sciences in Ingolstadt, the Technical University in Chemnitz, Airbus Group Innovations and the German Aerospace Center.

Unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming more common for civil and military applications, which are currently served by manned aircraft or are not deduced at the moment. In the context of civil applications of such aircraft current challenges are the integration into the civil airspace as well as autonomous mission conduction.

Military applications add the demand for low radar cross section and low power radiating data links.

The development of a scaled flight demonstrator with wing span of 3m and maximum takeoff weight of 150kg is common goal in the project.

This demonstrator aircraft exhibits a typical shape to achieve a small radar cross section provides the capability to flight upside down to point with a clean surface without edges and inlets into the direction of flight.

The Institute of Flight Systems develops the electrical power supply system, the actuation system for the flight control surfaces, the fuel system, a retractable landing gear and designs the complete wiring of the aircraft. Addressed research topics are in the area of air-to-air refueling and novel concepts for aircraft system monitoring.

Air Transat to become first North American Airbus A321LR operator - Airbus,"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wNy1haXItdHJhbnNhdC10by1iZWNvbWUtZmlyc3Qtbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFsci1vcGVyYXRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ten Airbus A321LR aircraft will be joining the fleet of Canadian airline Air Transat, making it the first North American operator of the longest-range single-aisle aircraft in the world. Air Transat will lease the aircraft through a deal with AerCap, and plans entry into service starting in 2019.

The A321LR builds on the success of the A321neo, which has captured over 80 percent of the market share with more than 1,400 orders to date. The LR option extends the aircraft’s range to up to 4,000 nautical miles and brings with it a 30-percent reduction in operating cost compared to its nearest competitor.



“This is an ideal aircraft for the North American market, and particularly for a carrier like Air Transat,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer-Customers. “It gives operators a highly efficient and affordable modern option for their transatlantic routes, and we look forward to other North American carriers following Air Transat’s example.”



The A321LR enables airlines to access new long-haul markets that were previously inaccessible with current single-aisle aircraft. With 206 passengers in a typical two-class layout, the A321LR offers the possibility for each passenger to carry up to three bags.



The A320neo family incorporates the very latest technologies, including new-generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020, as well as a 50-percent noise reduction. With more than 5,100 orders received from over 90 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.

Airbus Helicopters takes a fresh look at manufacturing - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRha2VzLWZyZXNoLWxvb2stbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters’ new rotor blade factory in Paris Le Bourget is not a futuristic facility crammed with automated assembly lines, machining robots and autonomous carts. Or at least, not yet. For now, it gives the company the right infrastructure to adapt production processes to the ongoing downturn. But it is also ready for future manufacturing needs – more complex blade shapes, propellers for multi-rotor vehicles and, yes, a dose of automation. Within the bigger picture, the new manufacturing site is part of a reorganization of Airbus Helicopters’ entire production system.

In 2010, then-Eurocopter began talking about moving blade production from an old site in La Courneuve, North of Paris, to a neighboring area – a former naval air base next to Le Bourget airport. The history of the facility in La Courneuve can be traced back to 1917, when Adolphe Bernard founded a company to manufacture Spad fighter aircraft used in World War I. When Airbus decided to move, the site had become a “patchwork of buildings,” head of plant Sebastien Ricci told Vertical during a recent visit. It was incompatible with today’s requirements in terms of production flow optimization and was rather “a spaghetti flow,” said Ricci. There was no room for expansion.

The move to the new site took six months and the factory has been fully operational since April. Some 500 rotor blade experts, from research engineers to repair technicians, work within the same surface area as in La Courneuve — 40,000 square meters (1 acre) — but it is spread over fewer buildings, making circulation of materials, components and products more straightforward. The site’s overall surface of 18 hectares (44 acres) also leaves space for expansion.

“We moved 400 industrial assets — ovens, autoclaves, machines, molds etc.” said Laurent Prat, head of industrial site. The rotorcraft manufacturer had created buffer inventories before the move, so deliveries were not interrupted during the six-month production hiatus.

Workers have been encouraged to reflect on the way they work and innovate. They can customize their workstation and design their own trolley. Such empowerment has an effect on safety and quality, according to Prat. It is also in line with younger workers’ worklife desires. “The new generation has different expectations, they want autonomy and quality of life; we have to give them freedom,” said Prat.

As at every Airbus Helicopters facility, the blade factory has had to cope with the downturn. The production rate — including repairs — stands at an annual 3,500 blades, whereas the facility is sized for 5,000. The proportion of repairs — 40 percent — is unusually high. “We want to be adaptable and build resilience into our workshops,” said Prat. This can be done by making workers more versatile, he added.

Over the next few years, Airbus Helicopters will arrive at a crossroads in terms of blade technology. Will automation be introduced at the Le Bourget factory? Will new projects, like the X6 (a Super Puma replacement) and the Racer compound demonstrator, adopt Blue Edge blades, like the H160? Will the company make or buy the propellers for the would-be new generation of vertical-takeoff vehicles, like CityAirbus?

On the first question, Prat said he believes that blade manufacturing is largely a manual job. It will stay so, he said, for the placement of a foam or honeycomb core. Nevertheless, Airbus is experimenting with robots for better quality and reduced cost. In lieu of the hand lay-up of pre-impregnated carbon fiber (around a glass-fiber sandwich spar), automated fiber placement or filament winding are being considered. Automation is mulled, too, for sanding and painting.

Vertical understands the first blade to benefit from the factory’s first steps in automation may be the X6 main rotor blade. Such automation may then be retrofitted to H160 blades.

Coming in September is a “manufacturing execution system” for improved sharing of information. Tablets will help workers with digital instructions (including video) and more direct communications with the support desk. Displays on the production floor will give a synthetic view of work progress. “I will be able to spend more time in my office, which I need, while keeping posted on what is going on on the manufacturing lines,” Ricci said.

Blue Edge swept blades, with their distinctive shape, have demonstrated better efficiency and lower noise on the in-development H160 medium twin. Although early artist renderings suggest the X6 will have similar main rotor blades, Prat said there is “no one-size-fits-all solution” and design engineers are looking at different solutions. As for the Racer, a dedicated mold would be expensive and it could thus reuse blades from another helicopter.

Meanwhile, future autonomous flying vehicles, like CityAirbus, may use vertical lift from horizontal rotors, but these are closer to straightforward propellers than a complex arrangement of variable-pitch blades and equally sophisticated hub. Therefore, Airbus may choose to buy the rotors from a supplier.

In any case, Airbus Helicopters has already made decisions on a new production organization at the company level. Each site will be specialized. While Marignane, France, will be responsible for dynamic components (including gearboxes), Donauwörth, Germany, will be in charge of airframes, and Le Bourget will focus on blades. “We concentrate assets and skills,” Prat said. Each site makes its own “make or buy” decisions. The specialization will happen gradually, however. For instance, the current blade manufacturing activity in Donauwörth will not be moved to Le Bourget, but all future models will have blades “made in Le Bourget.”

The specialization will not be the only activity. Almost every site will be responsible for a main component assembly — a section of the helicopter, fully equipped with its hydraulic lines, fuel system and electric harness. The front fuselage will be made in Marignane, the central fuselage in Donauwörth, and the rear fuselage in Albacete, Spain.

Final assembly lines will remain in Marignane and Donauwörth. The latter site puts together the H135 and the H145 light twins, while the rest of the civil product range is assembled in Marignane."
Glass of its Own: H135 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2dsYXNzLW9mLWl0cy1vd24taDEzNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since its launch in the mid-1990s, Airbus Helicopters’ H135 line has seen success in almost every sector of the helicopter market. Developed by the company then known as Eurocopter (and still type certificated as the EC135), it quickly became the go-to aircraft for emergency medical services (EMS) operators, a mission that now accounts for 49 percent of type ownership. Several incremental upgrades have improved performance, load capacity, and most recently with the EC135 P3/T3, its hot and high capability.

Now Airbus is integrating its proprietary Helionix avionics suite into the type, common to the larger H145, H175 and the forthcoming H160. The union brings an end to the ever-increasing alphanumeric type designations (the type is designated simply as the EC135H) and, according to Airbus, ushers in a new era of safety and intuitiveness in its “entry-level” twin.

Launched in 2014, the EC135 P3/T3 brought considerable upgrades in one engine inoperative (OEI) and hot and high performance, and was offered with Thales’ Avionique Nouvelle glass cockpit and center panel display system (CPDS). Barely three years later, that system finds itself being usurped.

Having poured R&D euros into developing Helionix, it makes sense for Airbus to try to recuperate as much of that as it can by increasing its availability. According to Ralf Nicolai, sales promotion manager at Airbus Helicopters Deutschland, the integration of Helionix was driven by the need to improve safety. With ever more complex missions demanding more pilot capacity, priority had to be given to providing an intuitive interface with the aircraft and the protections necessary to allow the pilot to dedicate more concentration on the task.

Helionix also allows core customers to take advantage of new facilities such as the LPV (localizer performance with vertical guidance) approaches; and the addition of a four-axis dual-duplex autopilot opens up the light offshore role — a mission that continues to grow in Europe despite the contraction in the oil-and-gas sector, thanks to the advent of helicopter-enabled offshore wind turbine inspection.

With innovation being something of a buzzword recently, it’s no surprise to see the manufacturer describing its own avionics suite as just that. But glass cockpits and autopilots are nothing new, and given the opportunity to fly a Helionix-equipped H135 in Donauwörth, Germany, I was curious about whether this integration brings anything really novel to a type that has been successfully carrying out its various missions for over three decades.

Putting it to the test

Given the performance and handling of the H135 series are well-documented, and the integration of Helionix provides no propulsion or capacity improvements, the focus of my flight was purely on the new display array and aircraft flight control system (AFCS).

During the (very brief) start procedure, Airbus Helicopters experimental test pilot Alexander Neuhaus explained the display layout. One flight navigation display (FND) is positioned in front of the pilot and two multi-function displays (MFDs) are located in the center and on the left. While the pilot’s FND layout is limited by the need to retain essential flight parameters, the indications on the other displays can be varied according to the mission. The left-most MFD can double as an FND for a pilot in the left hand seat, as it did for me throughout the flight. Although the “vehicle” page on the MFD will display all the system temperatures and pressures that pilots are used to monitoring, Helionix does away with the necessity to monitor that page by instead displaying an alert in white text below the PFD that describes divergent trends if they happen, well before a limit is reached. There is a tangible capacity benefit in not constantly having to scan across the cockpit to make sure your engines and transmission are performing nominally, and once you’ve got used to not having your Ts and Ps there, the urge to look at them eventually wears off.

In order to demonstrate the aircraft’s one engine inoperative (OEI) capability, we began with Neuhaus demonstrating a rapid OEI climb. Pressing the “train” switch under the center MFD accurately simulates a single engine failure, including transient Nr droop and slight yaw, but with full power still available if required. The first limit indicator is displayed on the power index tape, and as we entered the amber range above maximum continuous power, a small amber “pie” appeared and its slices began to fill, counting down our permitted two minutes in the range. Further collective pushed us into 30-second OEI power, with the pie becoming red. At 200 feet the point was made, and Neuhaus and simply double-clicked on the cyclic AFCS coolie hat and engaged the height hold on the collective, pinning the aircraft into a zero GPS groundspeed hover, still OEI. Deselecting “train” immediately reverts to normal operation, and electing the minimum height hold possible of three feet resulted in a leisurely descent at 300 feet per minute, well outside the vortex ring threat.

After “beeping forward” on the cyclic coolie hat to select an appropriate airspeed, Neuhaus allowed the autopilot to handle the transition to forward flight, and handed control of the aircraft to me. Breaking out of the autopilot (AP) hold to avoid some traffic crossing ahead of us was effortless, and banking the aircraft resulted in a coordinated turn without any pedal input or sensation of “fighting” the autopilot heading hold. Releasing the stick, the aircraft returned to the selected heading just as smoothly.

Maneuvering towards our nominated confined area, it was striking how easy the PFD was to interpret — even by somebody with little glass cockpit time and who is used to gauges rather than tapes. A single glance was enough to build sufficient situational awareness, allowing us to concentrate on the all-important lookout during our short visual flight rules (VFR) transit.

I released the aircraft from the AP and reverted to attitude hold for the descent. Glancing inside at the power index tape, a short white line showed me the point at which it estimated my Nf and Nr may decouple. I elected to approach downwind to see how the AP hover-hold would cope with a tailwind, and in the final stages of the approach, Neuhaus selected the MFD to show the feed from a camera in the tail. While it was reassuring to see the tail was not among the shrubbery, I’m not sure I’d want to rely on depth perception through a camera lens to judge my clearance.

Once in the OGE hover over the confined area, double-clicking the AFCS hat switch gave us the super-stable hover again, despite the wind’s subtle attempt to weather-cock us to the left. This particular mode will be well appreciated by those in parapublic roles that involve any time in a high hover over incident scenes. As for SAR or any precision work involving hoist operations, Helionix has another trick up its sleeve: one click on the AFCS hat and the aircraft moves obediently one meter in the appropriate direction.

Departing the confined area while maintaining safe single-engine was simply a matter of keeping the power index indicator below the blue OEI line. Once back at altitude, I wanted to exercise the AFCS. We went from having all four upper modes engaged down to stab-out with hardly any change in attitude. No jolts, no alarming shuddering, in fact nothing at all to indicate that the AP had left the aircraft to its own devices. Except Helionix barking “AP Disconnect, Hands On,” which is a nice executive cue that might save more than your blushes one day. More impressively, engaging all four axes in a 45-degree AOB turn resulted in a gentle roll out onto the datum heading. No chance of any spilled champagne down the back.

All that was left was to let the aircraft fly the LPV approach into Donauwörth, which at a shade over six degrees looks steep when you’re able to see out of the window. Predictably, after Alex had selected the approach on one of the inter-seat Garmin GNS750 consoles, the aircraft flew itself dutifully around the procedure.

Lightening the Load

So, aside from a thoroughly enjoyable hour in the skies above Bavaria, what does Helionix bring? Well, firstly there’s the obvious — it makes flying ridiculously easy, to the extent that anybody who cut their teeth on “less refined” machines might feel justifiably aggrieved.

Some might argue that in making Helionix the only option for its entry-level twin, Airbus is denying its customers choice. But I think this misses the point about this integration completely, and relies on the flawed assumption that the upgrades offered by the H135 with Helionix are primarily enhancements to its instrument flight rules (IFR) capability.

The ability to manipulate everything from the cyclic and collective is clearly aimed at pilots with a mission to achieve in fine weather or foul, but is intuitive enough that I had the measure of it within an hour. Once your muscles know where all the coolie hats are, you’ll be able to fly the aircraft instinctively and accurately, whatever the conditions — seamlessly transitioning from manual flying to the AP modes as the situation demands. While this might sound like a weapon in the IFR arsenal, it doesn’t really do anything in that environment that others don’t. Where it comes into its own is in a busy VFR mission where you can work the kit with your fingers, letting it keep you safe from the ground and hazardous flight regimes while you concentrate on what’s important: the mission and your lookout. The latter being immeasurably improved by the carefully considered layout of the PFD.

Airbus will doubtless feel the benefit of rationalizing disparate avionics suites, and their suppliers, into one package delivered in-house. And yes, for those looking for a new light twin from Airbus it’s Helionix or nothing — although it must be said that the cost is no greater than a P3/T3 with equivalent fit. Likewise, the company will certainly benefit from being able to open up the market to those wishing to operate a light twin offshore in all weather.

Buyers that can put the IFR and LPV capability to use stand to gain the most, and among those, Airbus’s EMS customers have been arguably best catered for, understandably. And operators who also have the H145 or H175 on their books will spend far less converting pilots between the types. Those buying the type for a comfortable ride between business engagements may feel less direct benefit — whether they will recoup the cost as a result of fewer champagne spillages is arguable. Perhaps the most gain will be felt by the pilots themselves — either their job is going to get easier, or they’re going to be able to do much more."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus said it was on track to meet a target of 10 A350 deliveries a month by the end of 2018 as it hit a milestone of 100 deliveries since Europe's newest wide-body jet came into service, but doubts remained over its A320neo plans.

Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President of Commercial Aircraft Fabrice Bregier reaffirmed the A350 target after delivering a A350-900 jetliner to China Airlines .

The European planemaker is juggling complex industrial and demand factors as it increases production of the A350 and the smaller A320neo family to regenerate its portfolio.

Qatar Airways last month cancelled four A350s following delays though a person familiar with the matter said the two sides were in constructive discussions on the issue.

The carrier had earlier cancelled several A320neo jets due to problems with engines developed by Pratt & Whitney. It has expressed interest in the larger A321neo, but this time powered by alternative engine supplier CFM (GE.N) (SAF.PA).

Airbus executive Bregier has been in the Gulf state recently for talks, according to Qatar News Agency.

Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies (UTX.N) on Tuesday reaffirmed its target for deliveries of its new Geared Turbofan engine for the A320neo.

Airbus is expected broadly to stick to its own delivery expectations when it reports earnings on Thursday.

Industry sources say it has opted for now to accept Pratt's commitments and wait for more engines, but that it remains frustrated at the slow pace of recovery which puts pressure on the planemaker's delivery plans for the rest of the year.

Airbus aims to deliver some 200 A320neo-family jets in 2017.

In a sign of the task ahead, industry sources say more than half of these were originally due to be Pratt & Whitney variants under the original confidential production plan for the year, since Pratt's engine entered service before CFM's model.

In the first half, Airbus delivered just 16 Pratt-powered A320neo jets, barely a third of the 43 powered by competing CFM engines, several sources said. That leaves more than 80 Pratt-powered jets to deliver in the remainder of the year.

Story continues

Airbus declined comment.

Deliveries are said to be held up partly because airlines are holding out for more spare engines which Pratt is unable to deliver.

Speaking to Reuters on Tuesday, United Tech finance director Akhil Johri acknowledged pressure on the supply of spares.

""There's always a trade-off between spares versus production engines... Ideally, if we had unlimited capacity we would satisfy both, but unfortunately that's not the case,"" he said.

CFM has indicated that it sees rising demand for its new LEAP engines but its production plans are seen unlikely to contain enough buffer to compensate for Pratt's difficulties, at least in the short term.

It has also had some glitches with forgings and materials but is so far said to be just a few weeks behind schedule.

Sentinel-5 Precursor will provide essential atmospheric chemistry data to the Copernicus programme before the Sentinel-5 instrument becomes operational in 2021 on the MetOp Second Generation satellite.

Airbus was prime for Sentinel-5 Precursor, with three sites involved in development and manufacturing of the satellites and its components: Stevenage (UK - prime), Toulouse (France) and Friedrichshafen (Germany).

Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space in the UK said: ""For Sentinel-5 Precursor we used the commercially successful AstroBus platform, enabling us to meet challenging delivery and cost efficiency targets. This mission will give Europe new way to measure global pollution levels in much greater detail.""

Sentinel-5 Precursor features the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) instrument, developed by Airbus DS Netherlands for the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Netherlands Space Office. TROPOMI will measure ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, methane and other atmospheric pollutants at a higher resolution than previous instruments. Having more accurate atmospheric data will enable improved climate models and pollutant tracking and forecasting. The MetOp Second Generation spacecraft will feature a different Sentinel 5 instrument.

UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The UK-built Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and the success of the Copernicus Programme demonstrates what we can achieve through collaboration with our European partners and the UK’s vital role in the programme thanks to our Earth observation expertise.

""We’ve been clear that we want our companies and universities to continue participating in key EU space programmes, and through our Industrial Strategy and ongoing investment in the UK space sector, we are ensuring we have the infrastructure and skills in place to support our ambition to capture 10% of the global space market by 2030.""

Josef Aschbacher, Director of Earth Observation Programmes at ESA said: ""Sentinel-5 Precursor will be the sixth Sentinel satellite launched as part of the Copernicus space component. It will monitor atmospheric chemistry, an important parameter for air quality and climate change studies. The contribution of the TROPOMI instrument by The Netherlands has been crucial for this ESA mission.""

Sentinel-5 Precursor is due for launch in September 2017.

Airbus Shapes a New Business Model for the C295: Expand the Global Fleet Through Working with a Leasing ... - Second Line of Defense,"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3NsZGluZm8uY29tLzIwMTcvMDcvYWlyYnVzLXNoYXBlcy1hLW5ldy1idXNpbmVzcy1tb2RlbC1mb3ItdGhlLWMyOTUtZXhwYW5kLXRoZS1nbG9iYWwtZmxlZXQtdGhyb3VnaC13b3JraW5nLXdpdGgtYS1sZWFzaW5nLWNvbXBhbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2017-07-13 By Robbin Laird

The C295 has become a global asset.

With nearly 200 aircraft already sold and operating worldwide, the C295 is gaining traction as a global aircraft.

This is in significant contrast to the C-27J, which has been purchased by a much smaller number of nations and therefore does not have the same kind of global presence.

Now with a new business model, namely selling the aircraft to a leasing company, the number of global users will expand and current users could add operating hours through a lease option.

The leasing company involved is Acasta Enterprises Inc., which is a Canadian public company and has signed a firm order for 12 C295 transport aircraft.

98367 random 1.0 5.0

One of the key elements within Acasta is the Stellwagen Group which is described by the Acasta website as a “fully-integrated provider of asset management, technical management and fleet and capital financing solutions to the global aviation industry and its investors.

Stellwagen was formed in 2013 to fill a gap in the aviation finance market following the financial crisis. Since then, Stellwagen has also expanded into aircraft servicing and investment management.”

http://acastaenterprises.com

http://www.stellwagengroup.com

Geoff Beattie, Chairman of Acasta, said: “This game changing agreement with Airbus for the unique C295 will transform Stellwagen, it also validates its business plan, demonstrates continued industry innovation and leadership and positions the Group to further develop the commercial market.”

Stellwagen Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Brennan said: “The C295 is a remarkably capable and versatile aircraft.

We have intensively studied the potential for its use in all civilian and humanitarian operations and we look forward to working with Airbus and operators throughout the world.”

http://www.deagel.com/news/Stellwagen-Orders-12-C-295-Transport-Aircraft_n000016639.aspx

Last year, Stellwagen hired the former Rynair deputy CEO to become the CEO of the Group.

According to The Irish Times:

The former deputy chief executive of Ryanair, Howard Millar, is set to join aviation financing group Stellwagen with plans to raise $1 billion in capital to provide secured aircraft financing to airlines across the globe.

Mr Millar will take up the position of chief operating officer of the Stellwagen Group, which includes the Dublin based Aviation Finance Company as well as Seraph Aviation Management . Mr Millar will also serve as chief executive of Stellwagen Capital, the credit investing arm of the group, focused on credit-oriented investment strategies in industries.

Mr Millar spent almost 23 years with Ryanair as deputy chief executive and chief financial officer before stepping down in October 2014.

Douglas Brennan, chief executive, said that Mr. Millar will work closely with him “to drive the operating and financial performance of the group”.

“As CEO of our new subsidiary Stellwagen Capital, Howard will lead this innovative financing vehicle in raising capital from both the debt markets and from large institutional investors mainly, in Europe and the US. This capital will enable the group to provide secured aircraft financing to airlines across the globe. This is a big step forward in the evolution of the group and we expect Stellwagen Capital to launch its initial capital raise of $1 billion in Q4 2016.”

Mr Millar said he was “delighted” to join the Stellwagen Group, pointing to a “great opportunity” to raise significant amounts of capital to finance the world’s growing fleet of aircraft.

“ The initial capital raise of $1 billion is slated for Q4 2016, and we expect to raise up to $5 billion over the next three years. We will use innovative and highly efficient structures to raise capital for secured financing of both new and delivered aircraft, and generate significant returns for our investors.”

And now with this new agreement, the Group is reaching into the security and para-military market with a leasing approach.

As mentioned in the press release, a natural client might well be organizations involved in humanitarian operations, such as the United Nations, which need to use aircraft for core missions but do not operate those aircraft themselves.

By setting up a leasing arrangement, then operations and support can be provided to the client on a long term lease or perhaps fly by hour agreements with an overlapping set of clients with common operational needs.

This fits the core business of Stellwagen in a way that it would not for the current structure of Airbus Defence and Space.

C-295 North American Tour, 2017 from SldInfo.com on Vimeo.

Airbus has sold two aircraft to Ghana and one to Mali but with the new lease approach those African countries, which bought the aircraft as much to work with the UN as to serve national needs can expand their access to broader fleet operations through leasing opportunities.

The expanding capability of the C295 into the search and rescue area such as demonstrated in the Canadian and Brazilian sales can also provide a para-military or security market opportunity for the leasing approach as well.

If a fly by hour approach could be shaped for a consortia to meet additional surge requirements might be met by a leasing agreement as well.

In short, this is an exciting development for the para-military and military market, which can expand the global presence of a flexible multi-mission aircraft, namely, the C-295.

And the new model will enhance the numbers of C-295s in the global operating environment, which in turn can help strengthen the overall sales and support approach for Airbus Defence and Space as well.

10-year-old Airbus A380s could head to the breaker's yard | HeraldNet.com - The Daily Herald,"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMTAteWVhci1vbGQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzLWNvdWxkLWhlYWQtdG8tdGhlLWJyZWFrZXJzLXlhcmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Richard Weiss, Bloomberg

Airbus’s A380 superjumbo faces the ignominy of being broken up for spare parts if second-hand operators for the oldest jets can’t be found in coming months.

The double-deckers could be “parted out” to recover engines and other spares worth at least $100 million per plane, according to German fund manager Dr. Peters, which owns four A380s due to be returned between October and June by Singapore Airlines following the expiration of 10-year lease deals.

At the same time, talks are continuing with six potential operators of the jets, including an Asian low-cost airline that would fly them in a 700-seat single-class layout, Chief Executive Officer Anselm Gehling said. Prospective users also include carriers in the U.S., which has so far eschewed the model, and Europe, where British Airways owner IAG is continuing to evaluate deploying used A380s at airlines within the group, he said.

“Our main goal is to find new lessees,” Gehling said. “We’re also willing to sell the aircraft as some airlines told us they’d prefer that. Still, there are hardly any spare parts around when it comes to engines for A380s, so it may make sense to do a part-out for the first one or two aircraft returning.”

Airbus struck an order blank on selling new A380s last year and has offered to revamp the model with fuel-saving winglets and 80 extra seats on top of the standard 550 to improve its appeal. Boeing last month dropped the very large aircraft category from its 20-year forecast, saying it sees no long-term future for either the Airbus plane or its own 747.

Parting out can be a lucrative option even for relatively young planes, with components — especially turbine elements — carefully managed in the aftermarket. Original lease terms on the A380s require that they be returned with engines, landing gear and auxiliary power units effectively as new.

An Airbus spokesman said that the Toulouse, France, manufacturer remains confident in the market for second-hand A380s, adding that used planes will present a growth opportunity for new entrants and operators with new business models.

While the remarketing of the A380s due off lease is being done in conjunction with Airbus and Doric, which owns another Singapore Air plane, Dr. Peters has also engaged Sparfell & Partner to seek potential VIP customers for its four aircraft, with the Swiss reseller advertising them as Air Force One-style “head of state” transports on its website.

Some parties are also discussing short leases of two to four years in order to assess the utility of operating an A380, to be followed by five-year terms should the planes prove profitable, Gehling said. Doric said a year ago that the aircraft were being offered at a 40 percent discount to the $2 million-plus monthly rental rate for a new version.

For investors, parting out A380s — which had an original list price of about $250 million when they were bought, before discounts — should offer a decent return, Gehling said. After 10 years, they’d have typically had back 65 to 70 percent of their outlay, and would need $55 million to $60 million more now to break even, whereas an A380 could yield up to $120 million in components.

Singapore Airlines has orders for five more superjumbos which will maintain its fleet as its first planes come off lease. Germany’s WirtschaftsWoche news magazine reported earlier that Dr. Peters could opt to part out some of the returning aircraft."

Kicking off the two-week long tour with demo flights on July 3 in Zhuhai, the H215 will then ferry flight to both Shenzhen and Lijiang. The H215 will cover more than 2,000 kilometers across China, attesting in real time to its excellent long range capabilities, power, speed, and large useful payload.

“It is a pleasure for us to welcome the H215 for the first time in China, as we foresee a very strong future for this helicopter in the Chinese market,” said Marie Agnes Vève, general manager of Airbus Helicopters China. “The H215 is perfectly suited to meet China’s growing demand for heavy helicopters as it prepares to build up its forest aerial surveillance and firefighting capabilities.”

Customers will be invited on-board the helicopter to appreciate its excellent performance, high reliability and advanced technologies. The H215 will also showcase its superior firefighting capabilities, performing a series of flight demonstrations using a Bambi Bucket to extinguish fires.

The H215 is a proven multipurpose helicopter, combining advanced avionics and a reliable platform for rugged multi-mission capabilities. Its baseline configuration has been optimized to offer extremely competitive direct operating and maintenance costs.

Standard features include proven Makila 1A1 engines, the latest generation flight management system, and the most modern technologies, which include a glass cockpit avionics system and the renowned four-axis autopilot from Airbus Helicopters’ advanced H225 – providing flight envelope protection, unrivalled precision and automatic hover stability in even the harshest operating conditions.

“The H215 will easily complement the current fleet of nearly 40 Super Puma aircraft already performing a wide range of missions in China, from oil-and-gas operations to aerial work to VIP transportation,” said Vincent Dufour, VP of commercial, Airbus Helicopters China. “This highly robust and versatile rotorcraft provides excellent performance and will be a real asset for the country as the demand for helicopters to protect its citizens and natural landscapes continues to increase.”

Airbus Helicopters is the leader in the civil turbine market in China with a market share of about 40 percent. For the first time in 2016, China became Airbus Helicopters’ largest civil market in terms of annual bookings. The company has seen steady growth in the region and is poised for the trend to continue — Airbus Helicopters broke ground last month on its H135 final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao, becoming the first Western helicopter manufacturer to establish a FAL in the country."

Noordwijk, 06/07/2017 - Mercury remains the most mysterious planet of our inner Solar System. BepiColombo, Europe's first mission to Mercury, will set off in October 2018 on a journey to the smallest and least explored rocky planet in our Solar System.

The European Space Agency (ESA), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Airbus - the industrial prime contractor leading a consortium of 83 companies from 16 countries - laid out the scientific goals of the mission and presented the impressive four element spacecraft, in a final viewing before its launch next year. Piled up in a 6.4 metre high stack, the 4 tonne BepiColombo spacecraft is close to finishing its test campaign. It will be shipped to Europe´s spaceport Kourou in French Guiana in March 2018.

The Sun’s glare makes it impossible to study Mercury in detail using telescopes and the extreme heat and proximity to the Sun make it hard to reach. So far, only two NASA missions have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 in the 1970’s and Messenger, which orbited the planet from 2011 until it ran out of fuel in April 2015.

ESA and JAXA have teamed up for the mission BepiColombo. Named after the Italian professor Giuseppe ‘Bepi’ Colombo, who was instrumental in making the Mariner 10 mission such a success, the mission is made up of two separate orbiters, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO supplied by ESA) and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO supplied by JAXA).

The BepiColombo mission will examine the peculiarities of Mercury´s internal structure and magnetic field generation, and how it interacts with the Sun and solar wind. It will investigate surface features and chemistry, such as the ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles. The mission's science will significantly improve our understanding of the formation of our Solar System, and the evolution of planets close to their parent stars.

Today is the last time that the complete stack will be on view in Europe. After testing the connection and separation systems with the Launch Vehicle Payload Adaptor System from Arianespace in late July the spacecraft will be disassembled by testing its module separation systems. Additional functional and performance checks will follow the mechanical test programme and then a final thermal test of the Transfer Module will be performed in November. At the end of March 2018, the spacecraft will be shipped to Kourou. Once in French Guiana, the team will reassemble the stack and install it on the Ariane 5 launch Page 2 of 4

vehicle, with launch scheduled for October 2018. After a seven-year cruise, the Transfer Module will be ejected and the remaining modules will reach Mercury in December 2025.

BepiColombo - Exploring Mercury

Additional Information for Editors

The BepiColombo Spacecraft



As prime contractor for ESA, Airbus is responsible for designing and building the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and all other European spacecraft hardware. Engineers have created a stacked spacecraft, so that both orbiters can travel to Mercury as one unit, served by a dedicated propulsion module for the transfer, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), also designed and built by Airbus.

To travel from Earth to Mercury involves slowing the spacecraft and allowing the Sun’s gravity to pull the spacecraft towards it - thereby reducing the size of the orbit. To arrive at the correct speed to be captured into orbit by Mercury’s gravity, the spacecraft must slow by 7 km/s - this is seven times the thrust needed to reach Mars. BepiColombo achieves this braking by means of nine planetary fly-bys (1 x Earth, 2 x Venus, 6 x Mercury) and the use of an Electric Propulsion System (especially developed for the mission) to provide 4 km/s of the braking.

After seven years of travel, and 18 orbits around the Sun to enter Mercury’s orbit, the MTM will be ejected and the Mercury Planetary Orbiter will take over propulsion tasks. By means of a free gravity capture the stack will swing into orbit around Mercury and then descend successively to the scientific orbits. The Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will be spin ejected in its orbit before the sunshield is ejected and the Mercury Planetary Orbiter descends further to its target orbit. The orbiters will then conduct the most thorough examination of Mercury yet undertaken.

Cool(ing) solutions for hot stuff



As it is only 58 million kilometres from the Sun, Mercury presents a special challenge to visiting spacecraft. During the day, the planet’s surface is baked to temperatures of 450 Celsius or more, hot enough to melt some metals. So spacecraft in orbit not only have to cope with the immense heat of the Sun, but also with the infrared radiation emitted by the hot planet.

In consequence, Airbus engineers have covered every external surface of ESA’s Mercury Planetary Orbiter, except for the single radiator side, with high temperature multi-layered insulation. The material, made up of 50 layers of ceramics and aluminium, was especially designed for the BepiColombo mission. The antennas are made of heat-resistant titanium, covered by a newly developed coating. As the MPO’s mission is to investigate Mercury’s surface, one side will always be facing the planet, so that the instruments can monitor the surface at all times, whilst the radiator faces away from the planet into deep space to reject heat.

Airbus Involvement



The prime contractor is Airbus in Friedrichshafen, Germany, with responsibility for the system design and realization, functional verification and the overall project management. The Stevenage, UK, team provided the structure and thermal systems for the MPO, and was responsible for the design and build of the MTM. Airbus in Madrid-Barajas, Spain, supplied the MTM structure.

The Electric Propulsion System employs 2 PPUs (Power Processing Units) developed by Airbus in Tres Cantos, Spain. These 48 kg units process 5 kW power each with which to drive the ion engines of the Electric Propulsion System. The PPUs are designed such that the 2 units can operate simultaneously any 2 of the 4 ion thrusters with which the propulsion module is equipped.

The MPO Solar Array, provided by Airbus in Ottobrunn, Germany, is a high temperature design operating at maximum 190°C, with specially developed components designed to be compatible with the thermal conditions. The solar array can deliver 2 kW. The thermal control of the array is achieved by a unique design involving a mix of cells and OSRs (glass mirrors) which occupy 17 percent of the panel area. The solar array is kept in a safe temperature range by controlling the tilt and continuously rotating the array as the spacecraft orbits Mercury.

The MTM Solar Arrays, provided by Airbus in Leiden, The Netherlands, are also of high temperature design operating at maximum 190°C and use the same technologies as the MPO. Whilst approaching the sun the solar array output increases, accompanied by an increase of temperature. Once the array temperature has reached 190°C (at about 0.5 AU) the array must be tilted, thereby reducing its projected area and limiting its output. The two wings total 40 m2 and have a mass of 290 kg.

Fear of Landing – A Serious Runway Incursion: Embraer 195 vs Airbus 320 - Fear of Landing,"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZmVhcm9mbGFuZGluZy5jb20vYWNjaWRlbnRzL2FjY2lkZW50LXJlcG9ydHMvYS1zZXJpb3VzLXJ1bndheS1pbmN1cnNpb24tZW1icmFlci0xOTUtdnMtYWlyYnVzLTMyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There was a serious runway incursion at Brussels Airport on the 5th of October 2016, when an Embraer ERJ-195LR crossed in front of the path of a landing Airbus A320-214. The Belgian Air Accident Investigation Unit released their report last week and it’s a good study on how minor inconveniences can pile up into creating a big problem.

At the time, runway 25 was having minor works carried out, as the prevailing wind was not optimal for that runway anyway. Runway 07R was being used for take-offs and runway 01 was being used for landings. The two runways intersect shortly past the C5 intersection of runway 07R. The 01 intersection was not marked on 07R.

The departing aircraft was the Embraer ERJ-195. It was an Air Dolomiti aircraft and crew, operated on behalf of Lufthansa as flight DLH4TX from Brussels to Munich. The captain was Pilot Flying and the first officer was Pilot Monitoring and dealing with air traffic control.

Flight DLH4TX was running late and the flight crew requested a departure from the C5 intersection of runway 07R. This would save them some taxi time and still offer plenty of take-off roll. Ground control responded by giving them the route to the C6 intersection.

Lufthansa flight DLH4TX: It is 4TX, ready for taxi Ground: For the 4TX, roger. Opposite traffic is joining the stand 155, as soon as clear continue Romeo 4, Inner, Zulu, Holding point Runway 07R, QNH1029 DLH4TX: Romeo 4, Inner, Zulu to holding point 07 when clear of traffic in front, may we take C5 for departure ? Ground: You can expect C6. After Inner 8, continue Outer 9, C6, Holding point 07R. DLH4TX: Romeo 4, Outer to C6, 4TX DLH4TX: Dolomiti 4TX, taxi is confirmed Outer 9 to C6? Ground: For the 4TX, first inner 8, then Outer 9 to C6 DLH4TX: Copied, first inner then outer to C6, 4TX

I should note here that Brussels is not known as the easiest airport to navigate, although I’ve never flown there myself. The first officer reported that his work load was high during the taxi operations in the dark in what he called an ‘unfriendly airport lay-out’.

Meanwhile, the Airbus A320, Aer Lingus flight EIN638, was on final approach for runway 01.

Flight DLH4TX taxied to the C6 intersection and stopped before the stop bar, which was lit. They changed to the Tower frequency and were told to line up and wait, which the first officer read back before the aircraft continued onto the runway.

DL4TX: Brussels Tower, H4TX approaching Charlie 6, Ready for departure Tower: H4TX Charlie 6, Line up and wait 07R DL4TX: Charlie 6, Line up and wait 07R, 4TX Tower: Shamrock 638, Cleared to land. Runway 01 Wind 070 degrees, 6 kt Aer Lingus EIN638: Cleared to land 01, Shamrock 638

It was the same controller speaking to both aircraft. Note here that the controller never mentioned the inbound A320 to DL4TX as an explanation as to what he was waiting for. At Brussels, it was standard to instruct the departing aircraft to line up on runway 07R and then wait for further instruction. The controller would wait until the landing traffic on runway 01 to pass the intersection and then would clear the waiting aircraft for take-off.

At this point, the crew of flight DL4TX had some issues lining up on runway 07R.

Taxiway C6 makes an oblique angle with Runway 07R. As this taxiway is parallel with active Runway 01, it is reported by other pilots that it provides a good wide angle to monitor the arriving traffic on the latter. On the other hand, aircraft have to make a turn of 120° when they line up in the direction of 07R.

One of the guidelines for aerodrome design in ICAO Annex 14 Attachment A and EAPPRI (and also in the ACI Runway Safety Handbook) is that runway entrances should be at right angles to a runway. This is because flight crew need an unobstructed view of the runway, in both directions, to confirm that the runway and approach is clear of conflicting traffic before proceeding to enter or line up.

The captain of the DL4TX found the taxiway centreline lights were not easy to follow. He asked the first officer if they were on the runway, unsure of their position. Both crew looked left and right and agreed there was no traffic in sight before making the turn and lining up on runway 07R.

The controller watched them line up, following standard procedure to maintain visual contact with any aircraft entering runway 07R from C6, as it is so close to the intersection of runway 01.

The captain asked the first officer whether they had received take-off clearance. The first officer confirmed that they had.

The Aer Lingus Airbus continued its approach, ready to land. And then everything seemed to happen at once.

18:40:50: Flight DL4TX lined up on runway 07R and immediately initiated its take-off run. They never saw the Airbus approaching.

The tower controller called out as soon as he saw the Embraer approaching the intersection.

18:40:53 Tower: Shamrock 638, go around sir. Go around.

18:40:59: The Aer Lingus crew also saw the aircraft on the runway starting to move forward and had already increased power to the engines, ready to abort the landing. They confirmed that they were going around.

18:41:02: Aer Lingus engines reached 100% thrust as the flight crew aborted the landing while ATC de-activated the proximity warning.

The collision was averted but only because there was enough time to tell the Air Lingus A320 to go arund. 12 seconds had elapsed from the take-off roll to the resolution of the conflict.

The fact that DLH4TX did not start the take-off run 10-15 seconds later is just a matter of circumstances (chance). Would that have been the case, then the outcome was the exposure of EIN638 to the DLH4TX’s jet blast or a collision between the 2 aircraft.

18:41:03: Tower contacted the departing flight DL4TX.

Tower: Lufthansa 4TX ? DL4TX: Pardon? Tower: Heu. You were not cleared for take-off, if I’m not mistaken, sir DL4TX: Can we continue? Tower: Yes, you can continue now sir.

Fifteen million points for coolness out of pressure. I’d have said three words, where the first two were ‘what the’.

The disaster was averted.

The situation we have here is initially easily blamed on the flight crew. The crew of flight DL4TX received an instruction to line up and wait, which the first officer repeated. They both knew that the next call would be to clear them for take-off. It took just a moment of confusion, as the crew tried to make sense of their position, to lose situational awareness. The captain wasn’t sure anymore if they’d been given a take-off clearance. The first officer, having expected it, became convinced that they must have had it already. And although the Aer Lingus A320 would have been clearly visible to them if they had looked, when they started their take-off roll, they focused on the runway ahead, not looking (or perhaps not knowing to look) at the approach for runway 01.

But it’s important to look at the wider picture. Part of the focus on human factors is accepting that mistakes do happen and understanding how and why they happen and what we can do to avoid and/or mitigate them.

From the literature on human factors, we can deduct that this kind of lapse is also related to the phenomenon of “expectation” in which the reception of a message is biased by the anticipation of actions to perform. In this case, the message received by ATC – stored in the short term memory of the crew – faded rapidly and the crew remained with the thought that they have got take-off clearance because they were cleared to get on the runway for the purpose of taking off. This determination can also be influenced by another phenomenon – the serial position effect, in which the human tends to recall the first and last words in a sentence and the instruction the crew received was “Line up and wait Runway 07R”, with the “wait” instruction sitting in the middle.

In this case, navigating the ‘unfriendly’ airport layout at night played a large role in distracting the flight crew. But also, it would have cost the controller nothing to refer to the crossing traffic when giving the instruction to line up and wait. This little bit of extra information would have meant the flight crew knew why they were holding. Instead of trying to remember if the controller cleared them for take-off, they would have been looking to see if the landing aircraft had passed them yet — much more difficult to get wrong.

The following is a posting of the the ATC communications at the time but I don’t know whether it has been enhanced or edited. Where the video transcript differed from the official transcript in the report, I used the report’s version. Also, bear in mind the quality of the radio by the person recording may not reflect the quality of the radio as received by the aircraft.

The report concludes with a long list of contributing factors, where any one of them might have averted the entire issue.

Cause

The incident was caused by the take-off without clearance of an aircraft instructed to “line up and wait” on Runway 07R while an aircraft was in final approach of Runway 01. Contributing factors

* Not using a mnemonic and/or cross-check for the take-off clearance by the DLH4TX crew.

* Limited traffic information/situational awareness given when delivering ATC clearances.

* Inadequate doubt-clearing management in the cockpit.

* The unfamiliarity of the crew with the airport.

* Authorizing aircraft to line up on RWY 07R at a short distance from the intersection with RWY 01 without correlation with landing traffic on this latter.

* Intersection and status of RWY 01 not indicated on RWY 07R.

* The complex taxiway layout (junction connecting 6 taxiways right before C6, the oblique angled entry taxiway including a part of the taxiway centerline lights).

Numerous safety recommendations were made relating to the aircraft operator’s training, Air Traffic Control procedures and to the signage and layout of Brussels Airport itself. It seems likely that most of them will be implemented, another incremental step towards the safety of commercial flight.

The Aer Lingus A320 landed safely after going around. Lufthansa flight DLH4TX reached Munich without further incident. The tower controller had to be replaced for the remainder of the shift.

I’m not sure this needed to be mentioned in the incident report but honestly, I don’t blame him. It must have been difficult to block out the visions of Tenerife dancing through his head.

Edit: Fixed the timestamps as well as the spelling of Aer Lingus. Clearly I was a bit too much in a rush for this one! Thank you to those who let me know."
Disaster averted at SFO after jet lines up to land on taxiway rather than runway - SFGATE,"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vYmF5YXJlYS9hcnRpY2xlL0Rpc2FzdGVyLWF2ZXJ0ZWQtYXQtU0ZPLWFmdGVyLWpldC1saW5lcy11cC10by0xMTI4MTUwMy5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A potential disaster was averted at San Francisco International Airport after the pilot of a commercial jet carrying 140 people mistakenly lined up to land on a bustling airplane taxiway rather than the parallel runway, officials said Tuesday.

The Air Canada jet, an Airbus A320, was instructed by an air traffic controller to halt its descent and conduct a “go-around” just before midnight Friday as it approached the taxiway, where four commercial planes full of passengers and fuel were preparing to take off, said the Federal Aviation Administration.

The plane, which was inbound from Toronto, carrying 135 passengers and five crew members, safely circled and landed on Runway 28R, the agency said. Officials said the FAA is investigating the incident, including “the distance between the Air Canada aircraft and the jets that were lined up on Taxiway C.”

Departing and parked aircraft intersect at San Francisco International Airport, Tuesday, July 11, 2017, in San Francisco. An Air Canada Airbus A320 was cleared to land on one of the runways at the San Francisco airport just before midnight on Friday, July 7, when the pilot ""inadvertently"" lined up with the taxiway, which runs parallel to the runway. There were other aircraft lined up on the taxiway waiting for departure when the incident occurred.

Few airports challenge a pilot to the same headache-inducing degree as Aspen, playground for the rich and famous. The approach involves descending into a narrow space surrounded on two sides by mountains and frequent cloud cover. On top of that, the winds can shift rapidly and gust wickedly. The Aspen approach is “like shooting through a mine shaft” with little margin for error, one pilot told the Los Angeles Times in 2001. Butte, Mont.

This airport is largely surrounded by steep terrain, and it doesn’t have a control tower. Bert Mooney also has cold-weather restrictions, requiring operating adjustments when the temperature drops to -2 Fahrenheit. One other note to pilots: There are a lot of deer around.

Ten miles east of Manhattan, LaGuardia sits beneath some of the world’s most congested airspace, with two major international hubs just a few miles southeast (John F. Kennedy) and southwest (Newark Liberty). It also has a high-density flow of traffic—roughly 17 hours per day—owing to its location as the closest of all three to Manhattan. If you’re flying into LaGuardia, grab a left-side window seat—that’s where to get the better look at the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan on approach. Grab a right hand seat in the summer time and you might get a way-too-close-for-comfort look at sunbathers on Queens rooftops just before touchdown. Seth Wenig/AP Bullhead City, Ariz.

This west Arizona airport has mountains on three sides—north, east, and southeast—including what pilots call “terrain” on both ends of the 8,500-foot runway. As a result, departures require a steep rate of climb. Laughlin/Bullhead landed commercial service last month with a daily flight from Phoenix, so more pilots—and passengers—are holding on tight.

The District of Columbia has plenty of restricted, heavily guarded airspace. Veer off course or ignore air traffic control near the Capitol and you’ll quickly find a fighter jet on your wing.

Pilots report frequent gusty tailwinds that can require quick adjustments on approach. Arriving flights typically land to the west, which means passengers get a view of downtown office buildings and parking decks. Peer out the window when flying into the former Lindbergh Field—it’s a landing you won’t forget. Telluride, Colo.

At 9,070 feet, Telluride is the highest-elevation commercial airport in America. It also features 1,000-foot cliffs on both ends of the runway and strong vertical turbulence during winter months caused by the mountain winds. There are several videos of the approach into Telluride showing the sharp plateau on which the strip is perched. “Nothing you want to do tomorrow is worth risking your life and the lives of your passengers today!” the Telluride airport says in a notice to pilots. Brown Cannon III/Sunset.com Cody, Wyo.

This airport has a few mountains in the vicinity but no control tower. It also requires pilots to perform what is called a nonprecision approach, a standard procedure for a pilot but one that doesn’t offer any vertical guidance, requiring the aviator to calculate the rate of descent.

Note: Pictured is a traffic control tower at Ellington Airport.

Air Canada released a statement Tuesday saying, “We are still investigating the circumstances and therefore have no additional information to offer.”

An audio recording captured the moment when the pilot, who was not identified, attempted to make the landing. He said, “Tower, Air Canada 759. I can see lights on the runway there. Can you confirm we’re clear to land?”

An air traffic controller responded, “Air Canada 759, confirmed cleared to land on 28 Right, there is no one on 28 Right but you.”

“OK, Air Canada 759,” the pilot confirmed.

A voice then interjected, “Where is this guy going? He’s on the taxiway.” At that point, the control tower instructed the pilot to go around and make another approach.

Shortly after the pilot changed course to circle around, a United Airlines pilot radioed in to the tower and said, “United 1, Air Canada flew directly over us.”

Barry Schiff, an aviation expert and former TWA captain, said “go-arounds” are not unusual but that a pilot attempting to land on a taxiway rather than a runway was extremely rare. Runway lights are always white, are particularly clear at night and are the same around the world, he said.

“When we hear about something like that, as pilots we do wonder how in the hell that can happen,” Schiff said. “It’s really difficult to understand how two professional pilots can look out their window and mistake a taxiway for a runway.”

The outcome could have been catastrophic if the jet had not changed course, Schiff said.

“The danger of hitting or crashing into another airplane is remarkably high,” he said."
Pratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fall - Yahoo Finance UK,"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9lbmdpbmUtZGVsYXlzLWhpdC1haXJidXMtcHJvZml0cy1kZWxpdmVyeS10YXJnZXRzLWZyYWdpbGUtMDUzNzM0ODg5LS1maW5hbmNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus turned up the heat on engine maker Pratt & Whitney over delays that have disrupted its biggest production line, after reporting a sharp drop in mid-year profits on Thursday. The European planemaker also said it would cut output of the A380, the world's biggest jetliner, to just eight from 2019, putting on life support a project that has been undercut by a generation of nimbler, fuel-efficient long-haul planes. Airbus's shares fell as much as 4.6 percent as investors contrasted its fortunes with those of U.S. arch-rival Boeing , whose stock hit a record high on Wednesday after its quarterly profit and cashflow beat estimates. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders challenged Pratt & Whitney, whose fuel-saving Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine is tied to thousands of orders for small A320neo jetliners, to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems. In an unusual public split with a major supplier, he said the engine maker had failed to meet earlier commitments and took issue with confidence over deliveries voiced by Pratt parent United Technologies . ""You can assume that Airbus is fully in the picture and knows what it is talking about,"" he told reporters, asked about the difference in tone accompanying their respective forecasts. ""If there is a difference in messaging and perception, then there is a difference, but our picture is the picture we have at Airbus and ... the situation is unsatisfactory,"" he said. Pratt & Whitney had no immediate comment. United Technologies this week said it was ""confident"" about building a total of 350-400 GTFs this year. Airbus reiterated its own delivery goal but added a proviso, saying it depended on engine makers meeting commitments. Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote that only 300 GTF engines may qualify as paid customer deliveries in 2017. Delays in A320neo deliveries helped slice a third off Airbus first-half profit on flat revenue. Its shares fell despite progress on the ramp-up of the wide-body A350 jet and confirmation of financial targets. United Technologies shares fell 1.3 percent. A380 OUTPUT CUT Enders confirmed Airbus had delivered ""around 15"" Pratt-powered A320neo twin-engined aircraft in the first half compared with around 100 planned for that variant in 2017. Asked how this squared with the 134 engines that Pratt says it delivered in the first half, Enders said deliveries of aircraft depended on customer acceptance. Industry sources say some airlines have been refusing to take Pratt-powered jets because of the lack of available spares. India, whose airlines have ordered hundreds of Pratt-powered A320neos, said Pratt had told its regulators it would address delays affecting GoAir and IndiGo. Air India has also had delays in getting jets with CFM engines, a minister said. The A320neo is one of several challenges as Airbus tries to accelerate output of new jetliners, fix glitches on its A400M military plane and squeeze costs out of the slow-selling A380. Airbus said it would cut output of the double-decker jet to eight in 2019, a move that insiders said was designed to stretch the dwindling order backlog into the next decade while Airbus tries to convince Emirates, IAG and others to place new orders. That compares with 15 this year and 12 in 2018 and means production will continue at what Airbus calls a marginal loss. Enders said Airbus was working on sales campaigns but the probability of immediate success was ""not ... necessarily high"". The second output cut in a year puts off any decision on whether to close the iconic A380, which would force the company to pay redundancies and writedowns but also ease some pressure on its balance sheet from project debts to European governments. Enders said Airbus was in ""constructive talks"" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350s, adding, ""I think we will find a way out"" of the issue. Airbus' second quarter operating profit fell 27 percent to 859 million euros on revenues of 15.27 billion. That fell short of the 910 million euros on revenue of 15.82 billion expected by analysts polled by Reuters.

Oman Air CEO Paul Gregorowitsch said the airline currently has 16 wide-body planes – six Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 10 Airbus A330 – but hope to increase that number to 25. This would involve replacement of some existing Airbus planes, and adding nine more new jets.

“We have negotiations currently with Airbus and Boeing. If (Boeing) has a good offer, we may take all, or we could have a mixture of Airbus A350 with the Boeing 787,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a press event in Kuala Lumpur.

On the Gulf dispute restricting Qatar Airways, Gregorowitsch said the airline is “filling in the gaps where required” to fly stranded Muslim pilgrims to their home destinations.

The dispute led to flight slots for Qatar Airways at the Dubai Airport being taken away, which Oman Air had pitched for and obtained.

“We then have the opportunity to increase flights between Muscat and Dubai from 8 to 10 daily,” he said.

The Current Market

The current market demand for the Airbus A330-300 has remained stable due to the continued demand from its operator base. Today, CV knows of only 1 aircraft listed as available for sale and/or lease. Out of 654 aircraft built, only 19 are currently in storage, which is less than 3% of the fleet. It is CV’s opinion that these percentages are still considered very low for an aircraft type that has been in production for over 20 years.

Over the course of the last 12 months, CV has seen values remain fairly stable for the type with a drop of 5-10% depending on the vintage. Lease rentals have also remained somewhat stable with a slight drop of 5-7% during the same timeframe. Although Rolls Royce seems to continue being the engine of choice by many operators, we have not seen any big value differences between the variants thus far. We see this trend continuing over the next 12 months as the industry continues to have a strong appetite for the type.

The A330 does have the advantage of not only being an excellent aircraft but also not having many competing in-production aircraft at the current time. The delays on the 787 and the fact that the A350 has only started to deliver, have also helped the maintain some of the demand of this aircraft due to many operators choosing the A330 to either compliment such orders or to be used as interim lift. CV does feel that, even when the 787 and A350 enter into service, the A330 should continue to see a good long-term future as a passenger aircraft since we feel that this aircraft will serve as a great compliment to an A350 fleet serving various shorter-range markets. Overall, CV still feels that this aircraft has a strong and viable long-term future as a passenger aircraft as well as having the potential for a good converted freighter aircraft.

VALUE DEFINITIONS

Current Market Value (CMV):

The Current Market Value (CMV) of an aircraft is the appraiser’s opinion of the most likely trading price that may be generated for an aircraft under the market circumstances that are perceived to exist at the time in question, according to the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT). The current market value assumes that the aircraft is valued for its highest and best use, that the parties to the hypothetical sales transaction are willing, able, prudent and knowledgeable, and under no unusual pressure for a prompt sale, and that the transaction would be negotiated in an open and unrestricted market on an arm’s length basis, for cash equivalent consideration, and given an adequate amount of time for effective market exposure to perspective buyers.

Base Value (BV):

Base value is the appraiser’s opinion of the underlying economic value of an aircraft in an open, unrestricted, stable market environment with a reasonable balance of supply and demand, and assumes full consideration of its “highest and best use”. An aircraft’s base value is founded in the historical trend of values and in the projection of future value trends and presumes an arm’s length, cash transaction between willing, able and knowledge parties acting prudently, with an absence of duress and with a reasonable period of time available for marketing.

Current Market Value (CMV):

To determine current market values of aircraft, CV uses, as our main source of data, any and all known reported market values. These values are extracted from numerous aviation industry sources and from CV’s proprietary and confidential transaction database.

As a secondary consideration, CV also analyses and gathers data on factors that influence the market value of an aircraft, such as its age, condition, configuration, fleet composition of such aircraft, similar aircraft available to the market, number of aircraft stored, operating economics, new aircraft prices, and the current state of the environment for the aviation industry.

This information is then entered into CV’s own proprietary transaction database and analyzed to determine a current market value based on a single sale transaction and using the assumptions as outlined in each aircraft valuation report at the time specified on the report.

Base Value (BV):

To determine its Base and Future values, CV first analyses any and all transaction information within its own proprietary database. This analysis allows CV to then establish the new price of an aircraft at a specific point in time. Historical data is then analyzed to determine the average depreciation rates of aircraft based on various conditions. This analysis is also broken down by aircraft type, mission, and in or out of production status. The result of these analyses is a depreciation factor which can then be applied to the various aircraft valuation models which CV utilizes for its valuation services and publications. Based on each valuation model, CV then creates base value curves for each aircraft which provide the base and future values for the aircraft which are reflected in the Turbine Aircraft Guide.

Lease Rentals:

The Lease Rentals provided in each valuation report represent CV’s opinion of aircraft lease rates in today’s operating lease environment. These lease rates are derived from CV’s own proprietary transactions database which contains a wide range of lease transactions received from numerous sources within the industry. This data is then compiled to produce the lease rentals provided in each aircraft valuation report.

Maintenance Cost Data:

The maintenance cost data provided in the Turbine Aircraft Guide is information that has been collected from various industry sources such as maintenance publications, conferences, MRO facilities, manufacturers, and financial institutions. The data represents the current estimated maintenance costs for such aircraft based on the assumptions and conditions provided.

Statement of Independence:

The aircraft valuation reports provided in the Turbine Aircraft Guide represent the opinion of Collateral Verifications and are intended to be advisory in nature. Therefore, CV assumes no responsibility or legal liability for actions taken or not taken by the purchaser of the Turbine Aircraft Guide or any other party with regard to the data provided in each report. By accepting these reports, the purchaser agrees that CV shall bear no responsibility or legal liability regarding these reports. CV also states that these valuation reports have been independently prepared and fairly represents the aircraft and CV’s opinion of its values."

The optional increase of AGW allows H145 helicopters to carry up to 100kg more of useful load.

It offers the possibility to carry more fuel, mission equipment or passengers for law enforcement, para-public or military missions.

The AGW of 3,800 kg is linked to a temporary restricted flight envelope until 100kg of fuel are consumed after approximately 20 minutes, Airbus stated.

Airbus Helicopters H145 programme head Axel Humpert said: “Since the entry-in-service of the new H145 in 2014 Airbus Helicopters has continued its efforts to improve the power and performance of the aircraft according to our customers’ needs.



“The new Alternate Gross Weight of 3,800 kg is a significant increase for a light-twin helicopter and offers real added value for H145 operators.”

The H145 is claimed to be the most advanced member of Airbus Helicopters’ multi-purpose twin-engine category.

With a capacity to accommodate up to two pilots and up to nine passengers, the helicopter can travel at a cruise speed of 129 knots.

To date, the EC145/H145 family of helicopters recorded a total of more than four million flight hours and more than 1,100 rotorcraft are in service worldwide.

The helicopter is equipped with the latest Helionix avionic suite with four-axis-autopilot and can be used for a variety of missions.

An announcement by Airbus that it will use Stratasys FDM 3D printers for non-structural parts such as brackets on its A350 XWB aircraft, sees the aerospace industry increase its adoption of 3D printed end-use parts.

Airbus will now use Stratasys Direct Manufacturing’s 3D printing capacity and infrastructure for parts on demand for its next generation of aircraft, with Airbus signalling that this will allow them to achieve greater supply chain flexibility, and improve cost competitiveness, while leveraging on reduced material consumption and waste.

The companies have worked together since 2013 on the implementation of 3D printing FDM applications, leading to the qualification in 2014 of the Ultem 9085 material for the production of flying parts on Airbus aircrafts. With thousands of parts installed on aircraft since 2015.

The announcement follows on the back of news that Hong Kong-based Western Tool & Mold (WTM), a specialist for the aircraft interiors market, is producing aircraft cabin components that meet stringent FAA and EASA certification requirements.

WTM is now using the Stratasys technology to 3D print aircraft cabin parts with complex geometries and low quantity demand such as first-class overhead bin lockers and lavatory components.

By 3D printing these parts directly from CAD designs, bypassing metal tooling processes, WTM says that its customers can test parts earlier in the design process and ‘save hundreds of thousands of dollars in manufacturing costs’.

“[The technology] gives us the opportunity to provide repeatable, certified aircraft parts to tier 1 and tier 2 aircraft parts suppliers but also the accompanying documentation process is now automated – making it easier to meet evolving industry quality standards,” said Collin Wilkerson, managing director, Western Tool & Mold."

Airbus's Sentinel-5 Precursor Satellite Ready for Launch - GIM International,"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXMtc2VudGluZWwtNS1wcmVjdXJzb3Itc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXJlYWR5LWZvci1sYXVuY2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe’s pollution monitoring satellite Sentinel-5 Precursor is ready to leave Airbus’ Stevenage site for launch on a Rokot rocket from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.

Sentinel-5 Precursor is part of the global monitoring programme “Copernicus”, a joint European Commission–ESA undertaking which aims to acquire continuous and accurate Earth observation data and provide services to improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security.

The satellite will provide essential atmospheric chemistry data to the Copernicus programme before the instrument becomes operational in 2021 on the MetOp Second Generation satellite.

Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space in the UK said: “For Sentinel-5 Precursor we used the commercially successful AstroBus platform, enabling us to meet challenging delivery and cost efficiency targets. This mission will give Europe new ways to measure global pollution levels in much greater detail.”

Sentinel-5 Precursor features the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) instrument, developed by Airbus DS Netherlands for the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Netherlands Space Office. TROPOMI will measure ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, methane and other atmospheric pollutants at a higher resolution than previous instruments. Having more accurate atmospheric data will enable improved climate models and pollutant tracking and forecasting. The MetOp Second Generation spacecraft will feature a different Sentinel 5 instrument.

UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said: “We’ve been clear that we want our companies and universities to continue participating in key EU space programmes, and through our Industrial Strategy and ongoing investment in the UK space sector, we are ensuring we have the infrastructure and skills in place to support our ambition to capture 10% of the global space market by 2030.”

Josef Aschbacher, Director of Earth Observation Programmes at ESA said: “Sentinel-5 Precursor will be the sixth Sentinel satellite launched as part of the Copernicus space component. It will monitor atmospheric chemistry, an important parameter for air quality and climate change studies. The contribution of the TROPOMI instrument by The Netherlands has been crucial for this ESA mission.”

Sentinel-5 Precursor is due for launch in September 2017."

Airbus A350 program on track as engine problems haunt the A320neo - Airline Ratings,"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXByb2dyYW0tb24tdHJhY2stYXMtZW5naW5lLXByb2JsZW1zLWhhdW50LXRoZS1hMzIwbmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is on track to meet its A350 production target of 10 aircraft a month by the end of 2018 after delivering 30 planes in the first half of this year, compared to 12 in the first half of 2016.

But continuing engine problems continue to cast a shadow over the A320neo and an announcement in the European aerospace company’s first-half results of another cut to A380 production has raised fresh doubts about the future of the superjumbo.

The European manufacturer delivered its 100th A350 to China Airlines earlier this week about 30 months after the start of production and has 847 firm orders from 45 customers.

Airbus has so far delivered the -900 version of the aircraft to 14 airlines worldwide and says it flying with an “outstanding” 99 per cent operational reliability.

A bigger version, the A350-1000, is currently in flight test and is expected to get type certification and be delivered to the first customer in the fourth quarter of this year.

“The A350 program is on track to meet the monthly production rate target of 10 aircraft by the end of 2018, the manufacturer said its results. “The level of outstanding work has improved in the industrial system and supply chain bottlenecks are improving.’’

Not going quite as smoothly is the A320neo program.

Airbus delivered 59 A320neos t in the 2017 first half, compared to eight in the same period of 2016, but the production ramp up remained “challenging” with customers still experiencing in-service issues with Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan engines.

“Engine supplier Pratt & Whitney has introduced some fixes but these improvements have not come through yet on a reliable basis under normal service conditions,’’ the plane-maker said. “Close to 200 A320neo deliveries are still targeted for 2017.’’

A lack of Airbus A380 orders led the manufacturer to cut deliveries in 2019 to eight aircraft.

It had previously announced it would cut production to 12 aircraft a year in 2018 and the further reduction will reignite speculation about the future of the four-engine superjumbo.

The results saw Airbus maintain its guidance for the full year as it reported group revenue flat at €28.7bn and net profit down 15 per cent to €1.5bn.

Revenues in the commercial aircraft business were up 3 per cent €21.8bn while earnings before interest and tax rose 157 per cent to €1.1bn.

The company received 203 net commercial aircraft orders in the latest half, up from 183 in the first half of 2016, to put the order backlog at 6771 aircraft at the end of June.

“The commercial aircraft environment remains healthy while the robust order backlog continues to support our production ramp-up plans,’’ Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said.

“However, we are facing challenges due to ongoing engine issues but we have a clear roadmap in place and have maintained our full-year guidance. Achieving the aircraft delivery target depends on the engine suppliers meeting their commitments.’’"
Airbus sells 140 planes worth $23 billion to China in one of its major deal - Business Standard,"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FpcmJ1cy1zZWxscy0xNDAtcGxhbmVzLXdvcnRoLTIzLWJpbGxpb24tdG8tY2hpbmEtaW4tb25lLW9mLWl0cy1tYWpvci1kZWFsLTExNzA3MDYwMDA0MF8xLmh0bWzSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYWlyYnVzLXNlbGxzLTE0MC1wbGFuZXMtd29ydGgtMjMtYmlsbGlvbi10by1jaGluYS1pbi1vbmUtb2YtaXRzLW1ham9yLWRlYWwtMTE3MDcwNjAwMDQwXzEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's company logo is pictured at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse

Airbus has signed an agreement to sell 140 aircraft to China, it said on Wednesday, in a deal worth almost $23 billion at list prices.

The agreement, signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Germany, is for 100 A320 family aircraft and 40 A350 planes, Airbus said.

""It's one of the biggest deals that we've signed in a long time,"" Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders told journalists after signing the deal in Berlin.

The planes will be purchased by state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, which will then allocate them to Chinese airlines.

The A320 planes will be a mixture of the older CEO and the new NEO version with revamped engines, while the majority of the A350 orders are for the -900 model. The deal is flexible pending negotiations with the airlines.

Enders said he expected up to 50 per cent of the A320 family planes would come from the Airbus final assembly line in China.

Enders was making his first public appearance since Airbus rolled out a new structure, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, changes which included a shift in the reporting line for its commercial sales team to Enders.

Enders said the shift in reporting lines for the sales team reflected the fact that commercial aircraft head Fabrice Bregier had been given more tasks in his new role as group-wide chief operating officer.

With orders slowing and the focus shifting to the backlog, Enders said the shake-up allows Bregier to concentrate on deliveries.

""This is merely a burden sharing mechanism because the focus should be on execution and this is what it's all about,"" Enders said.

""We have plenty of challenges on the execution side, be it the transition to the NEO, the ramp-up of the A320 family, the 350 family, not to mention the A400M, which is not entirely solved,"" he said.

Enders also said the group was in talks with the Chinese over the A380 superjumbo, which has suffered slow sales.

""It won't happen overnight. It has to be intensively discussed,"" he said."
FWSAR: Airbus makes progress while Leonardo court case is pending - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY29udHJhY3QtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWZ3c2FyL9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY29udHJhY3QtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWZ3c2FyLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | July 12, 2017 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 13 minutes, 7 seconds.

Despite the looming presence of a court challenge, Airbus Defence & Space does not expect any delay to its plan to manufacture and deliver to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) 16 C295W fixed-wing search and rescue (FWSAR) aircraft and a training centre at 19 Wing Comox, B.C.

“We don’t have any concern about any impact [the legal challenge] could have,” Pablo Molina, head of military aircraft in Canada, told a recent defence industry press conference. “We are meeting the schedule.”

In December 2016, Airbus was awarded a two-phase, $2.4 billion contract to replace the RCAF’s fleet of CC-115 Buffalo and CC-130H Hercules search and rescue aircraft, construct a state-of-the-art training centre and provide five years of in-service support. Options for maintenance and support services for an additional 15 years would bring the total value to $4.7 billion.

Molina said the requirements for in-service support and training simulators were being reviewed, a site survey in Comox was complete, and a final design review of the C295W was slated for later this year. A team from the RCAF’s Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment (AETE) in Cold Lake, Alta., recently completed evaluation of the aircraft in Seville, Spain, he added, and Airbus expected to begin cutting metal this summer.

But that early progress could be derailed if Leonardo, manufacturer of a rival aircraft in the FWSAR competition, the C-27J Spartan, is successful in its legal challenge that the federal government failed to correctly apply its own criteria when evaluating Leonardo’s bid.

While the CITT dismissed Leonardo’s complaint on technical grounds, stating that the company does not have standing to file a complaint because it is “not a Canadian supplier within the meaning of the Agreement on Internal Trade,” the federal court case is still proceeding. The CITT did not comment on the merits of Leonardo’s case.

In particular, Leonardo claimed that the C295W failed to meet two critical requirements: the ability to complete all specified missions within 13 flight hours or 15 crew hours; and compliance with applicable airworthiness standards that require back-up electrical power equipment for long missions, such as those specified for search and rescue, in the event of an engine failure.

“The Airbus C295 cannot meet either of these requirements, and this would have been evident to the evaluators from the proposal filed by Airbus,” Leonardo stated in court documents, suggesting that “from an airworthiness perspective, the C295W should have been considered non-compliant.”

The company added that “the C295 could have been part of a solution, but only as one element of a mixed fleet that included aircraft with the required capabilities.”

A senior official with Airbus, speaking on background, said the bidders were required to demonstrate “with performance data” the ability of their aircraft to reach more than 2,500 search and rescue incidents that occurred in the previous five years. However, reaching the farthest points of Canada’s SAR region, including 600 nautical miles west of Vancouver Island in the Pacific Ocean, 900 nautical miles east of Newfoundland in the Atlantic, and to the North Pole, within a single 13-hour crew day, was a rated requirement for which the contenders were awarded points.

The requirements in the request for proposals (RFP) did not impose a limit of 13 hours, he stressed, adding that while a crew may have a limit of 13 hours on duty in the aircraft, that can be extended at the discretion of the aircraft commander.

“The 13-hour limit applies to the crew, not the mission,” he said. “I can say without unveiling our speed that the C295 doesn’t have any problem meeting the North Pole, West Coast or East Coast limits. We comply with that in the same way that the current [RCAF] aircraft are compliant with that.”

LGen (Ret’d) Steve Lucas, a spokesperson for Leonardo and former commander of the RCAF, acknowledged the government’s wording was open to interpretation, but noted that the RCAF, in its August 2016 Future Air Operating Concept, specified that “SAR forces must have the ability to arrive in the vicinity of any SAR incident anywhere within the Canadian SAR [area of responsibility]…within a reasonable amount of time but no longer than one crew day.”

“Essentially what Canada has bought is an aircraft that doesn’t meet the requirements of the commander of the RCAF. That to my mind is significant,” said Lucas in an interview with Skies.

And while previous SAR incidents may be somewhat indicative of future events, he suggested the requirement to reach past search areas might be “looking backwards” rather than ahead as the Arctic climate changes and polar shipping routes open. “I think there is going to be an awful lot more that happens in the coming 25 to 40 years than there was in the years that they chose.”

Leonardo’s other point of contention is a requirement for an independent electrical power system. Since the C295W does not have an auxiliary power unit (APU), the company questioned in its affidavit whether the Airbus aircraft had “suitable backup electric/hydraulic generator capability…should an engine fail during the mission.”

“Our point is that Airbus has the only aircraft in the world that is trying to conduct extended range operations without an APU,” Lucas said. “They have a system, but what that is and whether the government simply said, ‘You’ve got a system, that’s great,’ or whether they went into it and did some sort of investigation, we have asked for that.”

In the RFP, aircraft were required to have “an emergency electrical power system, independent of the normal electrical power generating system, with sufficient capacity to power all systems necessary for continued safe flight and landing.”

But a government official, in an affidavit, stated that while an APU might be one way to be compliant with the specification, “nowhere in the RFP or related documents is there a requirement for an [APU] on the FWSAR aircraft.”

In its CITT filing, Leonardo acknowledged that being compliant for extended twin-engine operations, known as ETOPS, was not a mandatory requirement, but pointed out that many of the mandatory and rated requirements included missions “that will take the [aircraft] far distant from suitable airports, and thus require that the [aircraft] comply with these ETOPS airworthiness standards.”

Both Airbus and the government countered that ETOPS certification does not apply to military planes. ETOPS “was developed by civilian aviation authorities to govern the use of twin-engine airliners on long-range routes with fare-paying passengers,” the government official stated in the affidavit. “The civilian ETOPS regulations were never intended to be applied to military aircraft. To the best of my knowledge, no military authority has mandated ETOPS for military aircraft.”

The senior Airbus official said the C295W does not have an APU “because it increases the complexity of systems [and] increases the possible rate of failure of systems…We have enough power generating sources in the aircraft.”

In its affidavit, Airbus refused to provide specific performance details about the C295W, arguing that both the CITT and court challenges were a means to acquire a competitive advantage in other competitions where the C295W and the C-27J are head-to-head.

“Clearly for them to know our speed, what is the technical solution of our electrical system…will give them a competitive advantage in other procurement processes,” the official said.

Leonardo disputed the idea of a fishing expedition. Lucas noted only a technical expert would see the details of the aircraft, and would not be allowed to disclose those to the company, only the merits of its argument.

“The Airbus claim that this is us trying to find out information that we could use is, I think, ill-founded because the process allows for us to have an understanding without having the actual information that Airbus is interested in protecting,” he said.

Though it was not part of Leonardo’s affidavit to the federal court, the company is also questioning the contract budget. In meetings with government officials before the RFP was released, Lucas said the company understood the $3.4 billion budget to be fairly firm and structured its bid accordingly. When Airbus was awarded a deal valued at $4.7 billion, the company was shocked.

“During those discussions, we never got a hint whatsoever that you could blow the budget by anywhere near the amount that Airbus appears to have,” he said. “We believe that had we had that extra $1.3 billion to work with, our bid could have been a lot better, too. We are very curious as to how this situation occurred and we are looking at our options at this point.”

Lucas acknowledged that $3.4 billion was a “notional” budget for aircraft, a training system and 20 years of in-service support, but he noted that other wording in the RFP suggested the government could reject or reissue the bid if it exceeded the budget.

“When you take all the words that we heard, plus the wording in the RFP about the implications of exceeding the budget, to my mind that’s a strong signal,” he said. “I think we have some good questions and I think we deserve some good answers. The answers we have been given haven’t really met the mark, so we are going to continue to ask good questions.”

The Airbus official countered that the budget was clearly notional and “bids would be accepted if they were higher than it.” Airbus opted to bid significantly higher based on previous experience with similar programs for other customers. Rather than submit a bid it might have to renegotiate later in order to deliver the full system of aircraft, training and support, “we took the risk, consciously trying to provide Canada with the best possible solution, and not to create problems in the future,” he said.

“That is one hell of a big chance,” Lucas observed.

Leonardo might make a further submission to the federal court based on the information it has gathered about the budget, he confirmed."

The LR option extends the aircraft’s range to up to 4,000 nautical miles and brings with it a 30-percent reduction in operating cost compared to its nearest competitor.

“This is an ideal aircraft for the North American market, and particularly for a carrier like Air Transat,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer-Customers. “It gives operators a highly efficient and affordable modern option for their transatlantic routes, and we look forward to other North American carriers following Air Transat’s example.”

The A321LR enables airlines to access new long-haul markets that were previously inaccessible with current single-aisle aircraft. With 206 passengers in a typical two-class layout, the A321LR offers the possibility for each passenger to carry up to three bags.

The A320neo family incorporates the very latest technologies, including new-generation engines and Sharklets, which together deliver at least 15 percent fuel savings at delivery and 20 percent by 2020, as well as a 50-percent noise reduction. With more than 5,100 orders received from over 90 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo family has captured some 60 percent share of the market.

"Hawaiian's A321neo plan comes to life, without connectivity - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDcvaGF3YWlpYW5zLWEzMjFuZW8tcGxhbi1jb21lcy10by1saWZlLXdpdGhvdXQtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hawaiian Airlines has always indicated that its incoming Airbus A321neo fleet would be used to launch new routes, mostly away from its Honolulu hub. This week the carrier announced its first three A321neo services – one is a new city pair for the carrier, and the other two are seasonal routes which will be converted to year-round with the new aircraft.

The inaugural A321neo commercial flight will occur on 8 January 2018 between Oakland and Maui. But this is a one-off service – the A321neo will temporarily replace the Boeing 767 that typically flies this existing route – rather than a permanent substitution. The first full-time route for the A321neo will be a new service between Portland, Oregon and Maui starting on 18 January. Hawaiian is growing its mainland flights to compete with Alaska Airlines (which currently serves the route) and a significant increase in capacity to Hawaii from United Airlines which starts this winter.

Following the introduction of Portland-Maui, two historically seasonal 767 routes will gain year-round status thanks to the A321neo. Flights between Kona and Los Angeles begin on 11 March 2018, while flights between Kaua’i and Oakland begin on 11 April. The Los Angeles-Kona flights will begin with 767s and convert to the A321neo as new deliveries join the fleet. Delays from Airbus have forced Hawaiian to adjust the entry-into-service schedule already, and further tweaks would not be too surprising.

For passengers the new service means some notable upgrades to the inflight product as the 767s are retired and replaced. Hawaiian’s premium-heavy A321neos will be its first aircraft to offer wireless streaming entertainment and tablet/device holder integrated into the tray table or seatback, depending on class of service. All seats will have high-power USB power outlets available, with the Premium Cabin (first class) and Extra Comfort (extra legroom) seats also featuring standard 110V outlets. Interior fittings, including seat fabrics and LED lighting are designed to “reflect traditional island crafts”, according to the company. Design house JPA played a pivotal role in crafting this interior. Other amenities on board, including complimentary meals and snacks, match the service on the rest of the carrier’s fleet.

Notably missing from the new aircraft, however, is inflight connectivity. The Panasonic Avionics onboard streaming solution will support a BYOD environment, with no embedded screens, keeping weight and costs down.

But with the entire Hawaiian fleet remaining offline, including new delivery A321neos, the lack of a live connection on board is ever more notable to your author. Yes, more travelers to Hawaii fit into the leisure category, but those passengers also tend to want the option to connect.

Back in 2015, Hawaiian explained its disconnected status thusly: “Our decisions around in-cabin wifi are less about what other carriers’ global strategies look like and more driven by the cost and the performance of the technology. In order for connectivity to be a good fit for our strategy and guests, it would need to meet the basic criteria of good economics, strong performance over the Pacific and sufficient bandwidth to guarantee a high quality guest experience on a widebody aircraft.”

Separately, from an operational perspective it is also interesting to note that the A321neo fleet will serve three distinct island airports and also three different destinations on the mainland.

The flight times are such that the planes will do relatively quick turns (under 2 hours) on the islands with the longer sits on the mainland side of the trip. It will be interesting to see how the carrier approaches fleet utilization and adding new routes to the A321neo network as additional aircraft are delivered.
