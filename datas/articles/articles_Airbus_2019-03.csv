"Boeing Was 'Go, Go, Go' to Beat Airbus With the 737 Max (Published 2019) - The New York Times","Sat, 23 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDMvMjMvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtY3Jhc2guaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing faced an unthinkable defection in the spring of 2011. American Airlines, an exclusive Boeing customer for more than a decade, was ready to place an order for hundreds of new, fuel-efficient jets from the world’s other major aircraft manufacturer, Airbus.

The chief executive of American called Boeing’s leader, W. James McNerney Jr., to say a deal was close. If Boeing wanted the business, it would need to move aggressively, the airline executive, Gerard Arpey, told Mr. McNerney.

To win over American, Boeing ditched the idea of developing a new passenger plane, which would take a decade. Instead, it decided to update its workhorse 737, promising the plane would be done in six years.

The 737 Max was born roughly three months later.

The competitive pressure to build the jet — which permeated the entire design and development — now threatens the reputation and profits of Boeing, after two deadly crashes of the 737 Max in less than five months. Prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether the effort to design, produce and certify the Max was rushed, leading Boeing to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training."

Airbus' Skyways drone trials world's first shore-to-ship deliveries - Airbus,"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1haXJidXMtc2t5d2F5cy1kcm9uZS10cmlhbHMtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LXNob3JlLXRvLXNoaXAtZGVsaXZlcmllc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has begun shore-to-ship trials in Singapore with its Skyways parcel delivery drone. This marks the first time drone technology has been deployed in real port conditions to deliver a variety of small, time-critical maritime essentials to working vessels at anchorage.

The maiden shore-to-ship delivery flight was made to the Swire Pacific Offshore’s Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessel “M/V Pacific Centurion,” 1.5 km from the shoreline of Singapore’s Marina South Pier, carrying 1.5 kg of 3D printed consumables. Landing safely on the ship deck and depositing its cargo to the shipmaster, the Skyways unmanned air vehicle swiftly returned to its base, with the entire flight taking within 10 minutes.

The trials are being undertaken in conjunction with partner Wilhelmsen Ships Services, one of the world’s leading maritime logistics and port services company. During the trials, Airbus’ Skyways drone will lift off from the pier with a payload capability of up to 4 kg, and navigate autonomously along pre-determined ‘aerial corridors’ to vessels as far as 3 km from the coast.

Airbus’ Skyways lead, Leo Jeoh, shared his excitement at the milestone flight: “We are thrilled to launch the first trial of its kind in the maritime world. Today’s accomplishment is a culmination of months of intense preparation by our dedicated team, and the strong collaboration with our partner, as we pursue a new terrain in the maritime industry.”

“We are also happy to be taking a step forward for Airbus’ urban air mobility endeavour, as we continue to explore and seek better understanding of what it takes to fly safe and reliable autonomous flying vehicles safely,” he added.

“The now proven, seamless operation of drone deliveries from shore to ship, in one of the world’s busiest ports proves the hard work, investment and faith we, and indeed our partners, placed in the Agency by Air project over the past two years was not misplaced,” said Marius Johansen, Vice President Commercial, Ships Agency at Wilhelmsen Ships Services.

“Delivery of essential spares, medical supplies and cash to master via launch boat, is an established part of our portfolio of husbandry services, which we provide day in and day out, in ports all over the world. Modern technology such as the unmanned aircraft systems, are just a new tool, albeit a very cool one, with which we can push our industry ever forward and improve how we serve our customers,” he added.

The use of unmanned aircraft systems in the maritime industry paves the way for possible enlargement of existing ship agency services’ portfolio, speeding up deliveries by up to six times, lowering delivery costs by up to 90%, reducing carbon footprint, and significantly mitigating risks of accidents associated with launch-boat deliveries.



Airbus and Wilhelmsen Ships Services signed an agreement in June 2018 to drive the development of an end-to-end unmanned aircraft system for safe shore-to-ship deliveries. The collaboration marries Airbus’ extensive expertise in aeronautical vertical lift solutions and Wilhelmsen’s wealth of experience in ship agency services. A landing platform and control centre were set up at the Marina South Pier in November 2018, through the facilitation of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. The maritime agency also designated anchorages for vessels to anchor off the pier for the trials, while the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore worked with Airbus and Wilhelmsen to ensure safety of the trials.

Skyways is an experimental project aimed at establishing seamless multi-modal transportation networks in smart cities. Through Skyways, Airbus aims to develop an unmanned airborne infrastructure solution and address the sustainability and efficiency of unmanned aircraft in large urban and maritime environments.

Having demonstrated the ability to deliver parcels safely and reliably to vessels anchored off the coast of Singapore, Skyways will soon be commencing another trial phase delivering air parcels autonomously in an urban environment, at the National University of Singapore.

HPM was involved in the construction of the Airbus Engineering Center in Mobile over a decade ago."
Airbus and Boeing Report February 2019 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8xNS9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1yZXBvcnQtZmVicnVhcnktY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlcnMtYW5kLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both Companies Report Weak Orders as Airbus Decides to Cease A380 Production

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

A special note: Due to popular demand, our decision to reduce this monthly article series to quarterly issues has been withdrawn and we are, as of this article, reverting to monthly issues.

Boeing and Airbus each delivered 49 commercial jets in February 2019 compared to 49 and 38 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017). With 95 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is two shipments ahead of last year’s total for the first two months of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 88 jets in January and February, compared to just 65 for the same period last year.

In February 2019, Boeing delivered 32 737s (of which 26 were 737 MAXs), well below the current monthly rate of 52 jets. The company also delivered a single 747-8F, four 767s, one 777, and 11 787s. On December 13, Boeing celebrated the 787th 787 Dreamliner delivery and is currently in the process of raising the monthly production rate to 14 aircraft. Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg commented on January 30: “We have started transitioning to 14 a month in our factories and supply chains as we prepare to begin delivering at this higher rate.” Boeing delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and plans a further increase to 57 per month from early June. When asked about the potential for a 2020 production hike, Boeing stated in September 2018 that the market can support a production rate higher than 57 per month. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. On another note, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a 737 MAX 8, Boeing decided on March 14 to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. We will be covering the impact of this development further in the March Orders & Deliveries article, which will be published in April.

In February 2019, Airbus delivered three A220s, 36 A320s (9 CEO / 27 NEO), one A330 and nine A350s. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. By mid-2019, Airbus expects to be delivering 60 A320 jets per month on average. The company has internally been debating rates above 60 aircraft. Airbus delivered 93 A350s in 2018, up from 78 in 2017, and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month in 2019. The ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate means that the company has almost closed Boeing’s deliveries lead and could surpass its top rival already this year.

With just five net new orders in February, Boeing had a very slow month in the orders race. Boeing logged five gross orders (no cancellations => net of five). The company booked an order for four 767-300F widebody cargo planes for an undisclosed customer as well as an order for a single 737 MAX for a business jet customer. For the full-year 2018, Boeing managed to book 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

In the orders race, Airbus has so far had an awful start to 2019. While Air Vanuatu ordered four A220s, Airbus also reported as many as 90 cancellations => net of -86). This comes on top of 13 cancellations in January. Of the 99 cancellations this year to date, 31 are A380s – connected to Emirates’ decision to reduce its A380 order book. This decision subsequently forced Airbus to announce it will cease A380 production in 2021. In 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race as Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On February 28, 2019, Airbus’ backlog was 7,390 jets, of which 6,438, or 87 percent, are A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies, not far below the company’s all-time record-high backlog of 7,577 jets set in December 2018. By the end of February 2019, Boeing’s backlog was 5,904 aircraft (of which 4,723, or 80%, are 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets). Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.2 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.3 years. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio is 0.51. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is negative. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93. In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

WSU student steps in to help Airbus with last-minute project need - Wichita State University,"Fri, 08 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2hpdGEuZWR1L2Fib3V0L3dzdW5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDE5LzAzLW1hcmNoL2FpcmJ1c19zdHVkZW50X3NlYXRfZGVzaWduLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having direct access to students’ talent and skills is a huge part of why Airbus Americas moved to the Wichita State campus two years ago. One of those opportunities for collaboration played out perfectly this winter when Airbus officials in the research and technology department needed a last-minute artistic rendering for an airplane seat under development.

“Normally this wouldn’t be possible since we would have to contract with an artist, but with our proximity to WSU we decided to reach out to see what was possible,” says Samantha Stinson, Airbus marketing specialist and a WSU MBA student.

Within 12 hours, Shocker Studios Director Justin Rorabaugh had connected Airbus with Daniela “Dany” Diaz-Sustaita, a junior in the College of Fine Arts. After signing a non-disclosure agreement, she quickly produced three designs that demonstrated the seat Airbus was developing.

This definitely helped me get a perspective of what is to come in the future. Dany Diaz-Sustaita

And she did it during finals week.

“The response we received was incredible,” says Glenn Ramos, senior engineer, A350 Seats Engineering. “The sketches that were provided to us really put everything together. This coordination clearly showed what can be done when academia and industry join forces.”

Dawn Isometsa, a design engineering intern at Airbus and a mechanical engineering junior, is excited for more opportunities to work with WSU in the future.

“The collaboration between Airbus and Wichita State University turned out to be an extraordinarily positive experience for all of us,” Isometsa says. “Dany brought exceptional motivation and positivity to the project. I could call her to tweak something on the rendering and she would get it back to us that same day.”

Dany says she had never designed anything like this before and that becoming completely in tune with Airbus’ vision was a challenge. Thankfully, it was just the kind of challenge she thrives on.

“The short time frame affected the project very little since I work better under a deadline,” she says. “I tend to do better under pressure.”

Working on a real-life project and tight deadline gave Dany the exact kind of experience she needs to better prepare for her future career. And it will look great on her resume.

“This definitely helped me get a perspective of what is to come in the future,” she says. “As an animation major, it was great to get a chance to step away from programs like Maya and After Effects to start drawing traditionally again. This makes me remember that I have a wide variety of skills that can help me in my career and keep my options open.”

Stinson says that while Airbus has utilized WSU interns since locating on campus, this has opened Airbus officials’ eyes to the additional collaboration possibilities they have in their backyard.

“This showed us the true opportunities that come out of an applied learning university like WSU,” she says."
Lufthansa's Airbus A350-900 flagship aircraft is flying to Toronto's Pearson airport for the first time - Lufthansa Group,"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWZ0aGFuc2Fncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbWVkaWEtcmVsYXRpb25zLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy1hbmQtcmVsZWFzZXMvbHVmdGhhbnNhcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDAtZmxhZ3NoaXAtYWlyY3JhZnQtaXMtZmx5aW5nLXRvLXRvcm9udG9zLXBlYXJzb24tYWlycG9ydC1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Lufthansa’s Flight LH494 touches down at Toronto’s Pearson Airport on March 31, 2019, it will mark the first time an Airbus A350-900, the world’s most state-of-the-art, long-haul aircraft, arrives in the city from Europe.

Toronto will join an exclusive roster of North American cities Lufthansa connects to Munich with its new flagship long-haul aircraft that includes Boston, Denver, Chicago O’Hare, Newark and Vancouver.

Flight LH494 departs from Munich at 3:40 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Toronto on March 31, 2019 at 6:35 p.m. local time. The return flight, LH495, will depart from Toronto at 8:25 p.m. and will arrive in Munich at 10 a.m. on the following day. All times are local. This flight between Toronto and Munich will travel daily.

“Anyone who has flown on the A350-900, whether it be in Business Class, Premium Economy or Economy, discovers that the flying experience on this new aircraft is unlike any other,” said Hans DeHaan, Senior Director Canada, Lufthansa Group. “They experience a product that is very well in line with our company’s commitment to innovation, technology and efficiency. With our A350 aircraft, we can offer qualities and features that maximize the in-flight experience of our passengers to and from Canada.”

A350-900

The Airbus A350-900 is the world's most advanced, environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft. It uses 25 percent less kerosene, produces 25 percent fewer emissions and is significantly quieter on take-off. The aircraft has space for 293 passengers with 48 seats in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class. At just under 5.6 meters wide (18.4 feet), the cabin of the new Airbus is more spacious than comparable models of aircraft.

Lufthansa’s A350-900 also offers an exceptionally pleasant cabin environment that makes the journey on board the aircraft even more satisfying. In Business Class, passengers enjoy a self-service area where they can easily help themselves to snacks and drinks throughout the flight.

The Premium Economy Class offers much more than merely a comfortable seat. Passengers can check in two pieces of luggage at no charge, each with an allowable weight of up to 22.7 kilograms (50 lbs). Travelers can conveniently select their favorite food from the menu card, and the food is served on porcelain dishes.

The award-winning Economy Class, furnished in various shades of blue, features special ergonomically-formed seat upholstery and provides travelers with more personal and storage space. The A350 Economy Class was conceived by the design bureau, PearsonLloyd, and was awarded the German Design Award 2018 by the German Design Council.

Throughout the cabin, passengers can use their own mobile device as a second screen, as well as pre-selected programs from the on-board entertainment system up to six weeks prior to flight time.

Due to the aircraft’s particular construction, passengers reach their destination feeling more well-rested. This is achieved through improved cabin pressure during the flight, as well as a novel LED lighting system that adjusts with the day and night-time rhythm of the passengers.

Airbus Helicopters launches 5-bladed H145 upgrade - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 04 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWxhdW5jaGVzLTUtYmxhZGVkLWgxNDUtdXBncmFkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is launching a five-bladed version of its H145 light twin that promises operators an increase of 330 pounds (150 kilograms) useful load over the existing version of the aircraft.

The manufacturer revealed the upgraded version of the H145 — to be known simply as the “new H145” — on March 4, on the eve of Helicopter Association International Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.

The aircraft’s new bearingless main rotor system features a fully composite flex-beam and main rotor blades, doing away with a main rotor system design that had been used on previous generations of the H145, BK117, and Bo.105. It also dispenses with the main rotor head entirely — and the accompanying oil and grease needed to lubricate it.

In addition to providing increased lift with the latest airfoil design and material technologies, the blades have a unique foldable design that provides storage and potential cost replacement benefits.

Airbus has achieved the aircraft’s increase in useful load by reducing its empty weight by 110 lb. (50 kg), and increasing its maximum takeoff weight from 8,160 lb. to 8,380 lb. (3,700 kg to 3,800 kg). As Axel Humpert, head of the H145 program, told media during a pre-Heli-Expo briefing, the aircraft’s useful load is now almost the same as its empty weight.

“This reflects the maturity [of the aircraft] that we have on the one side, and the performance of the new rotor on the other side,” he said.

The new H145 (officially certified as the BK117 D3) will be offered both as a new aircraft off the production line, and in the form of an upgrade through a retrofit for existing H145s (previously known as the EC145 T2). Earlier versions of the type — essentially, those without a Fenestron — will not be eligible for the retrofit.

According to Humpert, new H145s off the production line will not cost any more than newly-produced four-bladed H145s.

“We wanted to keep the competitiveness of the aircraft, [so] we concluded that we shall not increase the price tag, but offer to the market a helicopter that [has[] more performance, [and] offers more useful load than the other version, [to] bring its competitiveness to even a higher level,” said Humpert.

The retrofit will be available in an “an affordable package” he added, from any Level D certified service center.

Certification is expected from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the first quarter of 2020, and Humpert said Airbus was in negotiations with launch customers for the type, with entry into service scheduled for mid-2020.

Both versions will be offered as deliveries begin of the newer type, “but we believe that the tendency will be created [for customers] to move to [the] five-bladed [aircraft],” said Humpert. A desire for fleet commonality is expected to account for those who still request the four-bladed aircraft.

To allow the manufacturer the flexibility to deliver aircraft in either configuration, it will have a batch of airframes that can be turned into four- or five-bladed aircraft on the production line. The final four-bladed aircraft will be delivered in February 2021.

A Desire for More Payload

Market demand drove the development, said Humpert. “The capability and the performance of the machine are [so] high that [operators] want to take additional useful load on board,” he said. “We had a rotor that allows [more useful load, so] we checked it in flight. Does it work? How does it feel? How does it pilot? And the results were so positive that we ran a business case, and it showed that we can achieve this goal with rather simple modifications inside an envelope that we can take while maintaining the competitiveness of the aircraft.”

While the evolution looks dramatic, Airbus has kept the upgrade process relatively simple, allowing it to rapidly progress through the development program. Essentially, the changes involve removing the four-bladed rotor, rotor mast and swashplate; and replacing it with the five-bladed rotor, mast, and swashplate. Beyond that, the forward crosstube and horizontal stabilizer have been modified to avoid dynamic responses. “That’s normal dynamic balancing that we do,” said Humpert.

Finally, Airbus has removed light anti-vibration absorbers, and installed an electrohydraulic actuator to help the pilot check the freedom of control on the ground when the rotor or engine is off.

In terms of avionics, the upgrade includes the installation of Airbus’s Wireless Airborne Communication System, which allows navigation and mission database information to be imported from a tablet, and has the capability for cockpit Wi-Fi. On the ground, it can automatically export flight data and generate flight reports.

The blades incorporate the latest airfoil design to produce more thrust than previous blades at the same power. While five blades have more drag than four blades in a rotor, Humpert said improvements to the aerodynamics of the rotor cuff of the blade had actually allowed the new H145’s blades to provide more lift. “This is the aerodynamic evolution which is technically behind it,” he said.

The new main rotor system has been simplified with no main rotor head — so the blades are attached directly to the rotor mast. This means fewer parts, resulting in the lower weight and simplified maintenance.

The blades have been designed for simplicity and thrust efficiency, said Humpert, and provide “some different characteristics” during flight. He said these included an increase in comfort level (with reduced vibration), while maintaining the same levels of noise and efficiency as the existing H145.

Why not six blades for the upgrade?

“If I had a sixth blade, the useful load would not increase by 150 [kilograms],” said Humpert. “It would increase by less, but add more complexity [to] the mechanical and aerodynamic design. We achieved the target with five blades.”

The new blades have affected the dimensions of the aircraft to a small extent — it is now almost four inches (10 centimeters) taller, and almost four inches shorter from the tip of the blade to the rear of the Fenestron. The diameter of the rotor disc has shortened slightly, from 36 feet, one inch (11 meters) to 35 feet, five inches (10.8 meters).

But with the foldability of the blades, which allows all five to be turned rearwards to run in the direction of the tail boom, the aircraft’s potential footprint and storage requirements have been minimized.

Each blade is essentially made of two parts: a meter-long “control cuff” at the base of the blade that attaches to the mast, and the remainder of the blade, which attaches to the cuff through two bolts. To fold the blades, one of the bolts is removed and the blade rotated backwards.

According to Humpert, the cuff is the “high technology” part of the blade, containing the composite flex beam — and it’s this that replaces all the bearings seen in a traditional main rotor hub. “It takes all the momentum, it takes all the need to change [the] pitch of the blade,” he said.

In addition to allowing the blade to fold without the need for a complex mechanism, having the flex beam situated in a separate control cuff provides for potential cost savings if a blade is damaged. “The high-tech and expensive part is this control cuff,” said Humpert. “[So] if the blade hits the wall of the hangar, for example, then you only need to replace this [outer] blade, which is much less expensive.”

The blades have no life limit, with replacement determined on condition.

The Test Program Continues

As of mid-February, the new H145’s flight test program was about 40 percent complete, having officially begun following the signing of an agreement with Kawasaki (a longstanding partner on the BK117/EC145 program) in April 2018. The program had flown three campaigns by that point, including one in the Pyrenees Mountains, one in the south of Spain, and a cold campaign in Finland. Flight testing is due to be finalized in October this year.

Antoine Van-Gent, chief test pilot at Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Donauwörth, Germany, said the difference in flying the two versions of the H145 “is almost negligible” — which was the aim of the development.

“There are some small parts where you see you can be a little bit more precise [with flight controls],” he said. “[But] we promised [the] program [team] that there will be no disadvantage to the aircraft for ride comfort, for controllability, [or] for handling characteristics. And up to now, even in the cold, we have seen [the] engineering does not surprise us in any negative way — and we get more or less the same aircraft.”

The blades represent the first practical application for technology used in Airbus’s Bluecopter program, which sought to advance various eco-friendly design and technology developments. But while the Bluecopter program used an H135 airframe, Humpert said Airbus has no plans to install the five-bladed setup on the smaller light twin in the future.

The manufacturer explored using Blue Edge blades (which feature swept-back tips, and are used on the upcoming H160 medium) on the new H145, but Humpert said the smaller rotor diameter and narrower blade chord on the type meant the full benefits of the technology wouldn’t be realized.

Airbus has delivered over 1,500 aircraft from the H145 family (which includes its predecessor, the BK117), with the collective worldwide fleet recording 5.5 million flight hours."

A new transatlantic link for Airbus' assembly network - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLWEtbmV3LXRyYW5zYXRsYW50aWMtbGluay1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLWFzc2VtYmx5LW5ldHdvcmvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has inaugurated Europe-U.S. transportation services with the Mobile Express, a new ship that carries major A320 Family jetliner subassemblies from the company’s European production network to the final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

Beginning with an inaugural voyage in February, the Mobile Express is linking the industrial site in Saint-Nazaire, France with the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility, located on the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico.

Crossing the Atlantic Ocean once per month, the Mobile Express carries such major A320 Family components as fuselage sections, wings and pylons, as well as vertical and horizontal stabilisers – helping to sustain the ramp-up of Airbus’ jetliner production in the U.S.

The Mobile Express serves as a link between the Airbus site in Saint-Nazaire, France and the company’s U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Alabama, USA.

A customised transportation system

With a total load capacity of 5,600 tonnes and a length of 180 metres, the Mobile Express has a cruise speed of 19 knots (approximately 35 kilometres per hour). Built in Italy, it joins Airbus’ existing aquatic fleet of vessels that support the company’s production network.

The Mobile Express’ name was chosen based on the contributions of more than 300 Airbus employees at Saint-Nazaire and Mobile, along with Airbus’ logistics and transport community and the ship’s owner.

Airbus manufactures components for its aircraft families at different sites across Europe – with final assembly performed at locations on the European continent, in China and the U.S. To support this wide-ranging industrial footprint, major components are transported by sea, river road and air. This tailored system enables large, pre-assembled aircraft sections to be moved by Airbus’ customised, in-house transportation system.

Alabama’s growing importance in the Airbus production system

The Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility was opened in 2015 and builds the A319, A320 and A321 jetliner versions. It is situated on the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, where Airbus also has an engineering centre that specialises in cabin and cargo systems for aircraft across the company’s product line.

Airbus’ industrial presence at Mobile took another important step earlier this year with the ground-breaking ceremony for a new final assembly line to build A220 jetliners. This operation results from Airbus’ partnership with Canadian-based Bombardier and Investissement Québec on the 100-150-seat A220 aircraft family.

The day Concorde flew into the history books - Airbus,"Sat, 02 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLXRoZS1kYXktY29uY29yZGUtZmxldy1pbnRvLXRoZS1oaXN0b3J5LWJvb2tz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Stephane Defer – Photos: Airbus



Commercial aviation took a supersonic leap into the future fifty years ago, when Concorde made its maiden flight.

The roar of the engines is deafening as the flight crew push them to maximum power. After a long wait, cheers of encouragement and rippling applause reach fever pitch and Concorde 001 thunders majestically into the skies above Toulouse.

It’s 3.38pm on 2 March 1969 and the first page in the history of supersonic commercial aviation has just been written. As Concorde’s four Olympus 593 turbines carry the aircraft into the distance the joy of the technicians, engineers, employees and onlookers witnessing the moment is plain to see. Six hundred journalists from around the world are at hand to report how ‘old Europe’ has met the challenge of melding speed and technology in service of passenger transport.

The maiden flight, described by captain André Turcat as ‘a trip around the runway’ lasted just 29 minutes and did not exceed 480 kph. Alongside Turcat the crew consisted of flight mechanic Michel Rétif, flight engineer Henri Perrier and co-pilot Jacques Guignard.

On the other side of the Channel captain Brian Trubshaw, co-pilot John Cochrane and flight mechanic Brian Watts coaxed Concorde 002 into the skies between Filton and Fairford for its first flight, even shorter at 22 minutes, on 9 April that same year.

It’s 3.38pm on 2 March 1969 and the first page in the history of supersonic commercial aviation has just been written.

Concorde 001 first broke the sound barrier in October 1969 and reached Mach 2 during its 102nd test flight, with its English ‘brother’ achieving the same one week later. The Franco-British cooperation programme had been signed by French ambassador Geoffroy de Courcel and British aviation minister Julian Amery on 29 November 1962. It confirmed the industrial agreement between Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation outlined a month earlier. The agreement committed the two countries to a 50:50 share of Concorde’s research and assembly costs.

It took seven years to arrive at the first flight that March afternoon. Many innovations resulted, from electronic flight controls and the first cockpit sidestick to anti-skid braking systems and the movement of fuel around the aircraft in flight to adjust its centre of gravity. The experience the French and British gained during Concorde’s development meant some pitfalls were avoided when Airbus was created – such as the politically-motivated dual assembly lines, one in each country.

A further seven years were necessary before Concorde entered commercial service, in 1976. In all 16 aircraft were built and they were operated by Air France and British Airways alone. The tragic - and the type’s only – crash at Gonesse near Paris in 2000 marked the end of operations, three years later.

For over 30 years, supersonic travel made commercial aviation faster. Today it takes around seven hours to cross the Atlantic by plane; Concorde took half that time.

Airbus Helicopters launches Flight Analyser data analytics to support operational safety - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWFuYWx5c2VyLWRhdGEtYW5hbHl0aWNzLXRv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta, Airbus Helicopters has launched a new analytics service that supports operational safety by analysing aircraft data post-flight to identify risks before they lead to incidents.

The application, known as Flight Analyser helicopter flight data monitoring (HFDM), analyses the data generated by a number of on-board sources, including the ISEI Helicom system, the Appareo Vision 1000 flight data recorder, and the Outerlink IRIS data recorder, to automatically detect situations that could have been safer or could have potentially led to an incident or accident.

Data types analysed include altitude, ground speed, vertical speed, height and engine parameters, among others. The system then augments this data with weather data and environmental context, such as sky coverage and obstacles present at the time of the potential event, to provide the user with the most complete picture possible. It also performs a confidence check for each event, assessing the reliability of the data.

“What we’re doing is helping our customers uncover issues that would have been near impossible to see in the raw data,” said Gilles Bruniaux, Head of Aviation Safety at Airbus Helicopters. “Being able to make sense of this rich data and learn from it so as to fly in a more informed way the next time represents another step forward for safety.”

Flight Analyser users are given access to dashboards that are updated post-flight. The output can be used by an organisation’s safety management system to support future decision making.

The service is available for all operator types, regardless of their size, safety management system maturity, and fleet composition. The self-service reports can be accessed via the customer’s personal space on Airbus’ Keycopter customer portal.

Women defining the aerospace industry of today – and the future - Airbus,"Fri, 08 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLXdvbWVuLWRlZmluaW5nLXRoZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UtaW5kdXN0cnktb2YtdG9kYXktYW5kLXRoZS1mdXR1cmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Historically, the aerospace industry was dominated by men – yet each generation of women successfully reduced the barriers, opening the field to more of their gender, accessing previously unavailable careers and gaining recognition for their contributions. More are joining the industry every year, and Airbus is at the forefront of advancing women in the workplace and developing female talent, helping to redefine the future of aerospace within the company and across the industry through partnerships and other initiatives.

To celebrate International Women’s Day, observed around the world today, and to recognise some of the talented women leading the way in aerospace, Airbus is featuring industry executives and a test pilot who discuss their professional lives in the helicopter sector.

Andrea Robertson – President and Chief Executive Officer, STARS (Canada)

Andrea Robertson’s career has been a life-long commitment to healthcare. Starting as a nurse in critical care, she progressively assumed leadership roles in the industry, from director of a number of critical care programmes to the chief nurse of the Canadian province of Alberta and to vice president positions that allowed her to run hospitals and even plan the development of a new type of hospital facility. Robertson serves as the president and CEO of STARS, an organisation that combines healthcare and aviation, allowing her to go back to her roots of critical care – while using helicopters to achieve the company’s healthcare goals. STARS, where Robertson has spent eight years, delivers critical care across three provinces in Canada and positions itself primarily in the field of saving lives – with aviation helping it fulfil this mission.

Robertson’s academic achievements include a bachelor’s degree in nursing, a master’s in healthcare administration, completion of an executive fellowship from Wharton University and Ivey School of Business, as well as an executive leadership program at Harvard.

Andrea Robertson (STARS) on finding balance in work at the intersection of two industries – healthcare and aviation:

“Aviation is far more complex than I realised when I came to the industry; it was a huge learning curve just to understand all the intricacies, regulations and safety requirements – which are absolutely imperative in rotary-wing aviation. We spend a significant amount of time and effort on this, and invest a great deal of money in safety – and aviation safety in particular. The beauty of bringing aviation and medicine together is that we learn a lot from each other in terms of safety and how it can be improved. The STARS team is very tightly knit, and we do a lot of situational and safety training. Crew resource management and keeping the mission safe are very important goals, and there are some real benefits of running two very complex and risky organisations together.”

Andrea Robertson (STARS) on the proudest moments in her work:

“This job is pretty unique: our teams are extraordinary, and what we do at STARS impacts so many people. When we airlift a critical care patient, it usually is the worst day of that person’s life – and the effect our help has on their family is unbelievably impactful. And when I look at our crews and what they achieve every day…when I reflect on our entire team and the impact it has on so many people’s lives – this is my proudest moment, that we can pull this all together and continue to provide care. It is astounding to hear our patients tell their story and to know that the reason they survived is because our teams are so incredible.”

Maura Hughes – Chief Executive Officer, Boston MedFlight (USA)

With an undergraduate degree in accounting and an MBA in Finance, Maura Hughes began her career as a public accountant. In this role, she audited a number of non-profit organisations, which gave her an appreciation for everything they do – and resonated with her own values and professional aspirations. Having audited Boston MedFlight as one of her clients during her accounting career, Hughes took the opportunity to join the company when they were looking for someone for the finance role, as the organisation’s goals aligned with her own principles. As a result, Hughes has been with the critical care transport company for over two decades – serving as Chief Financial Officer for the first 18 years and as Chief Executive Officer for the past three. She helped grow Boston MedFlight from a small-scale patient care non-profit to an organisation with over 160 staff and flying five helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft, along with seven ground ambulances.

Maura Hughes (Boston MedFlight) on finding her place in the industry and how aviation benefits her work:

“When I was in public accounting, my auditing of many non-profit organisations gave me a real appreciation for everything that non-profits do for individuals – and I realised that I wanted to be a part of that. It was a natural fit for me to work for a mission-driven non-profit organisation like Boston MedFlight (which was one of the organisations I audited as an accountant).

This industry is very rewarding. Working at Boston MedFlight, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to talk to patients and their families, who are all so grateful for the services we provide and the change we make in their lives. This work is about the mission and making sure we have the best staff, training and equipment in addition to investing in safety and technology. And aviation is an important tool that helps us care for our patients and achieve our healthcare goals.”

Maura Hughes (Boston MedFlight) on improving gender equality in the industry:

“If we are going to move the industry forward, we need to have more women in senior roles. I think it is very important to have female leaders – and show other women that there is a real career path for them and that they can achieve great things in their careers in general as well as at a specific organisation. It is much more meaningful to say that our CEO, CFO, Chief of Human Resources and our Chief Pilot are all women – because then others can see that women have a say in the organisation and have opportunities to grow within the company. It is very important to show young women who are starting work that they can have a very rewarding career path and encourage them to strive for professional development and growth, knowing it is possible.”

“Sophie” – test pilot for the Direction Générale de l’Armement

Having studied aeronautics at the l’École nationale supérieure l’aéronautique et de l’espace, Sophie today is the first French woman helicopter test pilot for the Direction générale de l’armement (“DGA,” the French Defense Procurement Agency). Her first job after graduating school was at Airbus Helicopters, where she worked on the H225 cockpit in the design office. After a year, she applied for the French Air Force and expressed a keen desire to pilot helicopters. She performed CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue) missions, had two tours in Afghanistan on the Caracal and finally flew VIP missions for top political officials in Paris. After applying to be a test pilot, she went to the Empire Test Pilots’ School (ETPS) in the UK where she received her diploma. Earlier this year, Sophie was hired as a test pilot at DGA Flight Testing in France.

“Sophie” on what has been her most career-defining moment

“Each step was really important and each one had an equally strong impact on me: my first day at Airbus Helicopters, my first days on mission in Afghanistan, the first time I transported VIPs such as the President, and of course the year of schooling to become a test pilot. Each step was important in its own right – a brick in the foundation on which I’ve built my career.”

“Sophie” on the biggest challenges facing women in this industry

“I don’t think we’re really in an era where we can still be considered ‘pioneers’ in this industry – there are so many female pilots today! The ratio between men and women, while not perfect, has gotten a lot better. This is a career that is open to women should they choose to pursue it. The challenges are not any different than the ones men face: we have to learn the same things as our male colleagues, we have to work just as hard and we have to integrate into the team just the same… My own opinion on it is that in this job, we are equal to men. I’m just another pilot – yes I am a woman – but I’m mainly just another pilot at the end of the day here!”

What advice they would give to someone starting a career in aviation:

Andrea Robertson: “If this is your passion – follow it. You do not see many pilots who stopped being pilots, as this is what they love doing. If you have a career in aviation, whether as an engineer or a pilot or in administration, if that is your passion – the rewards of pursuing it are phenomenal, even if aviation takes a lot of dedication and commitment.”

Maura Hughes: “Look at the organisation you want to work for and make sure your values are in line with those of the organisation – it will help you grow with the company. Look at who your mentors are going to be – because no one is getting where they are going without a mentor to help and guide them.”

“Sophie”: “Improving equality in this sector is a question of allowing young girls today to think to themselves that yes, I can do that too! There are other women doing this which means that I can as well! You don’t have to be a superhuman to be a pilot. I think we should stop saying that it’s exceptional that a woman does this kind of job and rather – it’s perfectly normal that a woman does this job! So that young girls understand that they too can do this should they want to.”"
C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (“CSALP”) to become Airbus Canada Limited Partnership - Airbus,"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1jLXNlcmllcy1haXJjcmFmdC1saW1pdGVkLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLWNzYWxwLXRvLWJlY29tZS1haXJidXMtY2FuYWRh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CSALP is pleased to announce it will soon change its name to Airbus Canada Limited Partnership.

The new name reflects the majority interest of Airbus in the limited partnership since July 1, 2018. The organisation will adopt the Airbus logo as its single visual identity.

“The new name is the logical next step after the aircraft was rebranded as the Airbus A220 on July 10th 2018, further strengthening customer confidence in the A220 as a full member of the Airbus aircraft family. It is therefore natural that our new name better reflects our organization as part of Airbus as well as signaling our distinct heritage and cultural identity here in Canada,” said Philippe Balducchi, CEO of the entity and Airbus Head of Country, Canada.

Over the course of the coming months, the new name will be formally adopted and applied to the existing documentation, materials and branded items. The Airbus and Bombardier logos will continue to be displayed side-by-side on the building exteriors in Mirabel, reflecting production activities on the site for both the Airbus A220 and Bombardier CRJ aircraft families.

About the limited partnership



Headquartered in Mirabel, Québec, the organisation is responsible for the development and manufacturing of the Airbus A220 family of single-aisle passenger aircraft. Majority owned by Airbus SE, partners include Bombardier Inc. and Investissement Québec (acting as mandatory for the government of Québec). The organisation employs approximately 2,200 at its headquarters and manufacturing facilities in Mirabel. The second A220 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama will start production in mid-2019."
Airbus Helicopters to offer CRFS retrofit kit for earlier variants of H125 and H130 models - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtdG8tb2ZmZXItY3Jmcy1yZXRyb2ZpdC1raXQtZm9yLWVhcmxpZXItdmFyaWFudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta, In order to encourage important safety enhancements for its customers, Airbus Helicopters is now selling its current crash resistant fuel system (CRFS) retrofit solution at a reduced cost and extending the development to additional aircraft models, namely the AS350 B3 and EC130 B4. These kits will complement the existing Airbus retrofit solution for the AS350 B3e, which was first made available as an option for newly manufactured helicopters in 2014.

“Above all, safety is the ultimate priority of Airbus, and it’s our duty to make sure that available solutions that help increase the safety of our helicopters are made readily available to our customers and that we work to remove barriers to implementing such solutions,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The more helicopters that we as an industry can equip with systems like CRFS, the more we can all work together to ensure that everyone in the aviation community is adhering to the same high standards.”

Airbus is offering its retrofit kits at the reduced cost to all customers, and will credit the difference to any customer having already purchased an H125 retrofit kit from Airbus Helicopters at a higher price The new Airbus B3 and B4 retrofit kits should be available to customers by early 2020. In addition, Airbus is offering an additional incentive in training credits to customers who retrofit their fleets with a third-party kit for the earlier H125 variants (B2 and prior).

Any Airbus H125 or H130 family helicopter in service today that does not have a CRFS can be equipped with one through either an Airbus or third party approved retrofit solution, based on the model. Airbus expects to have CRFS as standard on all new-built H125s worldwide by 2020. This is already the case for all H125s coming off the company’s U.S. final assembly line in Columbus, Mississippi. The H130 (EC130 T2) has come standard with a CRFS since its entry into service in 2012.

Taiwan's new StarLux Airlines signed a deal on Tuesday worth up to $6 billion for 17 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft in one of the island's biggest single commercial plane purchases.

The deal included five A350-900s and 12 A350-1000s with ten options, which are scheduled to be delivered from late 2021, the companies said.

StarLux, founded in May 2018 by Taiwan's EVA Airways former chairman Chang Kuo-wei, is set to operate regular international flights starting in 2020.

""The aircraft purchase deal today is one of the largest in Taiwan ... We promise to all that we will use the latest equipment, "" Chang said at the signing ceremony in Taipei.

The company declined to disclose financial details of the deal, which is the largest single purchase of Airbus planes in Taiwan.

According to Airbus list prices it is worth nearly $6 billion, though aircraft manufacturers usually offer discounts on large orders.

StarLux has also leased ten Airbus A321 neos, set to be delivered from October, which will fly its initial routes from Taipei to Southeast and Northeast Asia, a company statement said.

StarLux aims to serve over 20 destinations in Asia and North America by the end of 2024 with a fleet of 27 aircraft, according to the statement.

It would be the first airline in Taiwan to fly the A350-1000.

In 2015 EVA signed a deal worth more than $6 billion for 26 Boeing jetliners while Chang was chairman, making it the biggest ever single commercial plane purchase in Taiwan.

China to buy 300 Airbus planes in a huge blow to Boeing - ABC News,"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvY2hpbmEtYnV5LTMwMC1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzLWh1Z2UtYmxvdy1ib2Vpbmcvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9NjE5NjE4MDTSAWJodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9CdXNpbmVzcy9jaGluYS1idXktMzAwLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMtaHVnZS1ibG93LWJvZWluZy9zdG9yeT9pZD02MTk2MTgwNA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This comes at a bad time for the U.S.'s trade dispute with China.

The Chinese aviation industry is investing in 300 Airbus planes, delivering a blow to Boeing as the American company continues to deal with the fallout from the safety issues related to two recently downed 737 jets.

China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS), a Chinese leasing company, will buy a total of 300 Airbus aircraft, the companies announced on Monday during Chinese President Xi Jinping visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Underscoring the political significance of the deal, both leaders were present at the signing of the agreement.

“We are honored to support the growth of China’s civil aviation with our leading aircraft families – single aisle and widebodies,” Guillaume Faury, President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft and Airbus' future CEO, said in a statement. “Our expanding footprint in China demonstrate our lasting confidence in the Chinese market and our long-term commitment to China and our partners.”

The Chinese agreed to buy 290 A320 and 10 A350 XWB aircraft.

China's aerospace market is integral to both aircraft manufacturers, and Boeing aircraft offered key leverage to President Donald Trump in the trade dispute with China until the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 plane on Mar. 10 and the subsequent grounding of those jets around the world. The cause of the crash has not been determined yet, but the company is fighting to rebuild trust with airlines and customers.

China will need 7,400 new passenger and freight planes in the next 20 years, or more than 19 percent of global demand for more than 37,400 new aircraft, according to Airbus’ China Market Forecast for 2018 to 2037. Last September, Boeing cited similar figures for Chinese demand, saying the company forecast that China will need 7,690 airplanes to meet demand that is expected to increase 6.2 percent annually.

The Airbus deal comes amid a week of deal-making between China and European allies while trade talks with the U.S. remain unresolved. Just days earlier, Italy signed on to become the first developed economy to sign on to China's global investment program for Beijing's ""new Silk Road"" infrastructure programs, completing $2.8 billion in deals while Xi was in Italy.

""With a shared value of safety, be assured that we are bringing all of the resources of The Boeing Company to bear, working together tirelessly to understand what happened and do everything possible to ensure it doesn’t happen again,"" Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Boeing stands together with all our customers and partners to earn and strengthen the flying public’s trust and confidence in us every day.""

Transport designer Paul Priestman on designing the Airbus A380 interior - Dezeen,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8yMC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1wYXVsLXByaWVzdG1hbi1haXJjcmFmdC1pbnRlcmlvci1kZXNpZ24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month, Airbus announced it was ceasing production of the A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Transport designer Paul Priestman, who designed the superjumbo's first interior, spoke to Dezeen about its design legacy.

In February 2019, 12 years after its first commercial flight in 2007, Airbus made the ""painful"" decision to end production of its A380 aircraft after failing to secure enough orders from airlines.

The news came after Dubai-based airline Emirates, Airbus' biggest customer, reduced its A380 orders from 162 to 123 aircrafts.

""As a consequence and given the lack of order backlog with other airlines, Airbus will cease deliveries of the A380 in 2021,"" read a statement from Airbus CEO Tom Enders.

Although much admired by air travellers, it didn't take off with buyers. It is able to carry up to 800 passengers over two decks, in comparison to the 660-passenger-capacity of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet.

However, with a $445.6 million list price, it struggled to make a profit as seats were often left unfilled, while demand grew for smaller, more fuel-efficient mid-sized aircraft, particularly the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

But while future production of the A380 will come to an end, existing models will continue to fly, and its innovative design will ensure a legacy in future aircraft design.

""I wouldn't say that the A380 is facing its downfall,"" said PriestmanGoode's founding director and chairman Paul Priestman, who designed the first interiors of the A380.

""The decision to end production is an economic one, but from a passenger perspective it remains a hugely celebrated aircraft,"" he continued. ""It's an aircraft that people go out of their way to try and fly, and love to have selfies in front of.""

Priestman became involved in the creation of the plane in 2000, when he and his team were asked to ""design the future of aviation"". They were tasked with developing the aircraft's large interiors, which were unlike anything seen before and redefined the passenger experience.

He described the task as ""a dream project for a designer"", granting him and his team the opportunity to design an entirely new product.

""We had free reign to think big, to think about what the future of air travel could look like,"" Priestman said.

""I genuinely don't think we would be where we are in terms of aircraft design today if it weren’t for the A380,"" he added.

Since then, PriestmanGoode has designed the interiors for the Airbus A330, Boeing 777 and the first-class cabin for Lufthansa's A380 planes in 2010.

The interiors Priestman created for the original A380 gave the model its nickname at Airbus as the ""wow"" mockup, as this was the word people uttered when they entered the interior for the first time, according to the designer.

Priestman spoke to Dezeen about the process of designing the plane and why its place in aviation history is assured:

Natashah Hitti: How did you become involved in the development of the A380?

Paul Priestman: It was in 2000. PriestmanGoode had been invited to exhibit at a small exhibition of British design at the British Consulate in Paris organised by the Department for International Trade.

There I met a senior person from Airbus and we got talking. PriestmanGoode had just finished working on the new Virgin Atlantic interiors, and I talked a lot about design and its role in creating outstanding passenger experiences.

That was that really. Shortly thereafter Airbus invited us to tender for the design and mockup of an entirely new aircraft, and we won the tender. This was a dream project for a designer. While many aircraft are regularly updated with improvements, this was an entirely new product. We had free reign to think big, to think about what the future of air travel could look like.

Natashah Hitti: What is different about the A380 compared to other planes?

Paul Priestman: The A380's most distinguishing feature is, of course, its large interior capacity on two full-length passenger decks. And it's spacious, which means that airlines can not only carry a lot of passengers with the A380, but they can also offer public areas on board for passengers to stretch out. It ushered it a hugely prolific era for aircraft interior design.

Natashah Hitti: How did it influence aircraft design?

Paul Priestman: I genuinely don't think we would be where we are in terms of aircraft design today if it weren't for the A380. When Airbus awarded the design contract to PriestmanGoode, the dream brief was to ""design the future of aviation"", the interior we created was for the aircraft then known as the A3XX, which later became the A380.

Not only were we creatively free to develop the interiors, but the contract was also to supply a full-sized, fully finished working mockup of the interior installed on board an aircraft in Toulouse.

As our design work started, we built a full-scale replica of the double-deck A380 fuselage in the UK, then as we designed and made each component we fitted it to the replica to check for accuracy, then each component was disassembled, shipped to Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse and re-assembled in a A380 fuselage situated in the large Airbus Mock-Up Centre.

Hundreds of people were involved. I remember when we built it, the only usable stairs between the decks were at the rear of the aircraft, so if you were at the upper deck, and needed to get to the main deck, you had to walk along the entire length of the aircraft twice! I walked up and down that mockup so many times.

The mockup we created with Airbus was designed as a destination. The idea was that it was fully functioning, and that airline clients that came to see it could spend the whole day on the plane. There was a library, a bar with working coffee machines, air-conditioning, a lounge, and seats.

We thought a lot about the visitor's experience and carefully designed and choreographed every aspect of it. The A380 was being shown in the enormous Airbus marketing building, which is the size of an aircraft hangar.

This was the biggest passenger aircraft in the world but we were still concerned that entering it from a very large space would give the feeling of going into a smaller space. So we designed and built a small quiet reception area to welcome visitors and then a dimly lit airport jetway type link to the aircraft. The result gave the mockup its name, and it is still known at Airbus as the 'wow' mockup as so many people that entered the interior for the first time said ""wow!""

Natashah Hitti: Why is the A380 facing its downfall, and how do you feel now that production is ending?

Paul Priestman: I wouldn't say that the A380 is facing its downfall. The decision to end production is an economic one, but from a passenger perspective it remains a hugely celebrated aircraft. It's an aircraft that people go out of their way to try and fly and love to have selfies in front of. And as I mentioned previously, the A380 will keep flying. It's only future production that is ceasing.

Natashah Hitti: What does this mean for air travel in future?

Paul Priestman: As mentioned previously, the impact the A380 has had, and continues to have, on the design of aircraft interiors is long-lasting. And while future production of that aircraft has ceased, Airbus is continuously investing in R&D to create better, more efficient products, like Airspace, which we also collaborated on.

I'd like to note here also the importance that this project has had in the development of PriestmanGoode as a studio. It was a real moment for us; not only to be involved in the creation of one of the biggest products in the world, but Airbus allowed us to have our name at the entrance of the mockup and books about Priestmangoode in the on-board library. Since this project we have completed many interior design and mockup projects for aircraft manufacturers from around the world.

Natashah Hitti: What are your thoughts on the environmental issues with air travel? How can flying be made more green?

Paul Priestman: It's a complex issue. It's important to remember that flying, particularly over long distances, is convenient, and that as a result, people are going to keep flying. So for designers, our role is to see where we can have impact. There are suppliers making efforts in being more responsible in how they manufacture, for example using recycled Trevira [a flame-retardant fabric] and polyester fibres or plastics that are 100 per cent recyclable.

The durability of some materials, like wool, can also extend a product's lifespan, all of which are important. Aircraft manufacturers like Airbus continually invest into research to develop more efficient products. It's an ongoing process, but as consumer consciousness has developed, efficiency and reducing impact has come to the forefront of the industry."

“In the aeronautic sector, the conclusion today of a big contract in terms of A320s and big transporters, A350s, is an important advance and an excellent signal in the current context,” Macron said during a joint press conference with his Chinese counterpart at the Elysée Palace.

Picking up on the geopolitical implications of the deal, Xi noted that ""a united and prosperous Europe corresponds to our vision of a multipolar world."" According to newspaper Ouest-France, he added that ""China will always support the integration of Europe and its development,"" and insisted that Europe is ""a major pole.""

Trying to play down any risk of rival models clashing in a region where both Paris and Beijing are trying to push their influence, Macron said: “In Africa we are not strategic rivals but we can be better long-term partners in the fields of security, education, infrastructure and development.”

Deals à gogo

The dealmaking also stretched well beyond planes.

The countries agreed to allow French exports of chicken to China, Le Figaro reported. French energy company EDF and the China Energy Investment Corporation also signed a €1 billion accord to develop an offshore wind farm off China."
Employee focus: A day-in-the-life of an Airbus data scientist - Airbus,"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLWVtcGxveWVlLWZvY3VzLWEtZGF5LWluLXRoZS1saWZlLW9mLWFuLWFpcmJ1cy1kYXRhLXNjaWVudGlzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a workforce of some 134,000 people – and activities that range from the manufacture of aircraft, helicopters and spacecraft to delivering security and communications solutions – Airbus offers a true variety of career opportunities.

Adil Soubki, for example, is a data scientist at Airbus’ Flight and Integration Test Centre, a job created by the company a year ago. When flight test specialists cannot find the cause of an aircraft engine or system problem, they turn to Soubki.

Soubki and three data analyst colleagues work at an integrated grouping known as the Digital Factory Plateau in focussing on predictive maintenance, anomaly detection and root cause analysis. “Last year, we mainly worked on writing algorithms to detect abnormalities,” he says. “This year, our team is building a search engine for flight test and certification data.”

As an Airbus data scientist, Adil Soubki (second from right) relies on collaboration and dialogue with teammates and experts.

Timeline

7:30 a.m. > Trial and error Lydie Pallarols, a hydraulic system test specialist, has provided Soubki with flight test campaign data, which he checks to establish whether a failure with the engine-driven pump aboard an in-service aircraft could have been predicted prior to delivery. “In this instance, the algorithm is creating a false alarm,” Soubki said. “It detects noise as abnormal behaviour, but that’s not the issue. The problem is heat.”

9:30 a.m. > Collaborative work Soubki meets with his colleagues to discuss how the engine-driven pump’s parameters could be modified to enhance the failure prediction score and avoid false alarms. Data analysts rely on successful dialogue with experts and teammates – and in the case of technical hurdles, this can include Airbus’ Digital Transformation Office and Chief Technology Office.

11:30 a.m. > Flight test search engine As work progress on the engine-driven pump issue, it is time for another project. Soubki is working with David Roussel on a flight test and certification search engine that would help locate parameters using keywords. “This would enable users to enter parameters at certain configurations – for example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet – to obtain comparison information from other flights under the same conditions,” Soubki explained.

3:00 p.m. > Success! Soubki develops a new computer-based model for the engine-driven pump failure to detect the anomaly in data from flight test aircraft. “It shows the perfect split between bad and good performance, which is what we are looking for,” he stated. Soubki once again contacts Lydie Pallarols – the hydraulics specialist. Reviewing his data, she confirms the anomaly detection demonstrates that the problem stem from the engine-driven pump itself.

Soubki’s results are promising, according to Pallarols. “He generated an ultra-performing model that can open doors to other cases,” she added. “I’ve now asked him to run the algorithm on all production aircraft: in this way, we can obtain a clearer picture, as we will be analysing hundreds of flights.”

I love solving problems. I continuously learn more about aircraft because I work with specialists.

Wilhelmsen and Airbus Launch Singapore Maritime Drone Delivery Trials - DroneLife,"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmVsaWZlLmNvbS8yMDE5LzAzLzE1L3dpbGhlbG1zZW4tYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1sYXVuY2gtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLW1hcml0aW1lLWRyb25lLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRyaWFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We often think of drone deliveries as being most useful in remote, hard-to-reach locations. Usually, that involves providing a cargo-carrying alternative in rural areas or a link to places cut off by natural disasters. But ‘hard-to-reach’ can also apply in some of the world’s busiest ports.

A drone delivery project with a difference has taken off in Singapore, as part of a project launched by Airbus and Wilhelmsen to take items from shore to ship. It’s the first deployment of drone technology in real-time port conditions. The aim is to provide a valuable link between working vessels at anchorage and teams on land.

Airbus Skyways drone delivers via ‘aerial corridors’

The Airbus and Wilhelmsen trials took off from Marina South Pier in Singapore and navigated autonomously along pre-determined ‘aerial-corridors’. It took a 1.5km flight to Eastern Working Anchorage, where it landed on the deck of the Swire Pacific Offshore’s Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessel, M/V Pacific Centurion.

The drone dropped off its 1.5kg cargo without a hitch before returning to base. The entire delivery, from take-off to landing back at base, took just ten minutes.

Delivery trials from tugboat to ship have been conducted before in the maritime industry. But Airbus and Wilhelmsen claim the trial represents the first shore-to-ship delivery of this range and scope.

Marius Johansen, VP Commercial, Wilhelmsen Ships Agency said, “The now proven, seamless operation of drone deliveries from shore-to-ship, in one of the world’s busiest ports, proves the hard work, investment and faith we, and indeed our partners, placed in the Agency by Air drone delivery project over the past two years was not misplaced”.

Wilhelmsen views delivery by drone in busy ports as a natural evolution. The method offers a more cost-effective, quicker and safer means of delivering, small, time-critical items to vessels.

Johansen added, “Delivery of essential spares, medical supplies and cash to Master via launch boat, is an established part of our portfolio of services, which we provide day in and day out, in ports all over the world. Modern technology such as UAS is just a new tool, albeit a very cool one, with which we can push our industry ever forward and improve how we serve our customers”.

Wilhelmsen estimates that using drones could potentially reduce delivery costs by up to 90% in some ports, as well as having a smaller carbon footprint than launch boats.

Airbus and Wilhelmsen partnership comes to fruition

Wilhelmsen and Airbus signed an MOU in June 2018 to develop shore-to-ship drone delivery solutions.

“We are thrilled to launch the first trial of its kind in the maritime world. Today’s accomplishment is a culmination of months of intense preparation by our dedicated team, and the strong collaboration with our partner, as we pursue new terrain in the maritime industry,” says Leo Jeoh, Airbus Skyways lead.

The ongoing trial will focus on offshore supply vessels at anchorage 1.5km from the pier. Flights will be limited to this distance for the time being. Flights will gradually be ­­extended to as far as 3km from the shore. ­­

The trial is being facilitated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore is also working with Wilhelmsen and Airbus to ensure the safety of the trials."

Airbus Helicopters selects Pratt & Whitney PW206B3 engine to power H135 for U.S. Navy Trainer Replacement proposal - Airbus,"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtc2VsZWN0cy1wcmF0dC13aGl0bmV5LXB3MjA2YjMtZW5naW5lLXRvLXBvd2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta, Airbus Helicopters announced Wednesday its selection of the Pratt & Whitney PW206B3 engine to power the Airbus H135 IFR-certified helicopter the company is proposing for the U.S. Navy helicopter trainer replacement. Company officials made the announcement at the 2019 Heli-Expo industry trade show in Atlanta.

“Pratt & Whitney engines power a large portion of the H135 fleet flying in North America, and we feel this choice reinforces the H135 as the best-value solution for the Navy’s initial entry rotary-wing pilot training requirement,” said Chris Emerson, President of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and Head of the North America Region. “In partnership with Pratt & Whitney, Airbus is offering the Navy an enhanced training capability that will provide future naval aviators with the most realistic training available to prepare them for the fleet operations they will perform in more advanced aircraft.”

The H135, which is IFR certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, allows more efficient training of new pilots in environments and scenarios most similar to the Navy’s warfighting rotorcraft fleet, creating opportunities for better cost and operational synergies compared to single-engine trainers. It is a technologically advanced aircraft and one of the safest in its class, due in part to its advanced Helionix avionics system, with color digital multi-function displays, a four-axis autopilot, Integrated Flight Management System, and engines with Full Authority Digital Engine Control and one engine inoperative (OEI) training mode.

“We are proud to power the Airbus H135 proposal in support of the U.S. Navy Advanced Helicopter Training System,” said Maria Della Posta, Senior Vice President, Pratt & Whitney Canada. “With a track record of high performance, quality and reliability, our engines are the perfect choice for the U.S. Navy.”

The Airbus H135 is a market leading, multi-mission helicopter, in use with ten military services in nine nations for initial and advanced rotary-wing pilot training. More than 1,300 H135 family aircraft are in service around the globe with an accumulation of over 5 million total flight hours in missions such as search and rescue, armed scout, and pilot training.

The versatility of the H135 provides the Navy with performance attributes not found in single-engine helicopters, and offers some of the most advanced technologies available, providing instructor pilots and students with an optimum platform for training missions while also offering growth capacity for expanded mission requirements.

Airbus will manufacture the H135 for the Navy at its production facilities in Columbus, Miss. The Columbus plant has produced more than 430 UH-72A Lakota helicopters on-time and on-cost for the U.S. Army. It is also home to a production line for the H125 civil helicopter for the North American market.

Airbus Helicopters, Inc., is the leading provider of civil and commercial helicopters in the U.S. and began its operations 50 years ago in Grand Prairie, Texas.

Airbus & Audi reveal electric air taxi CityAirbus | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8xMi9haXJidXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtYWlyLXRheGktY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxlZC1iZWZvcmUtbWFpZGVuLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of the Urban Air Mobility project, Airbus has now presented the air taxi CityAirbus in the Audi town of Ingolstadt. The electric aircraft with eight rotors takes off and lands vertically and will be able to transport up to four passengers. The model still has its maiden flight ahead of it.

With the words “maiden flight soon” Airbus announced via Twitter that this is only a matter of time. The maiden flight is planned at the airport in the German city of Manching near Ingolstadt – about 60 km away from the development site at Airbus Helicopters in Donauwörth.

The development of the CityAirbus is embedded in the EU initiative Urban Air Mobility, which is to conduct practical studies on the use of aircraft for urban mobility. It is not yet clear which concrete pilot projects will be launched in the course of the initiative. However, it is clear that a total of 14 continental European cities are participating – including Ingolstadt, Hamburg, Toulouse, Antwerp, Brussels and Geneva.

This also explains why Airbus has now presented its air taxi in Ingolstadt. In the not too distant future, electric air taxis will be operated manually or autonomously in the city. The pilot project in the Bavarian city is supported by the Ingolstadt Technical University, the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt and various companies, including Audi.

Back in 2018, Airbus and Audi already presented an autonomous concept for horizontal and vertical e-mobility at the Geneva Motor Show under the name Pop.Up Next. It consists of a two-seater passenger cabin that can be coupled with either a car module or a flight module.

Since then air taxis have begun taking off. Airbus rival Boeing for example recently presented their take on a passenger VTOL. Aurora Flight Sciences, an aviation taxi developer acquired by Boeing in 2017 and now operating as a subsidiary of the aviation company developed the concept and is one of a number of firms that have partnered with Uber in an effort to develop a network of “flying taxis”. These are supposed to operate on the ride-hailing company’s forthcoming Uber Elevate product, planned for launch in 2023.

Airbus delivers first FANS-C-equipped A320 to easyJet - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wMy1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtZmFucy1jLWVxdWlwcGVkLWEzMjAtdG8tZWFzeWpldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Milestone marks the start of SESAR FANS-C demonstration by seven airlines

100 aircraft with FANS-C to demonstrate 4D initial trajectory sharing in Europe

Airbus has delivered the first *FANS-C-equipped A320 aircraft to easyJet. In the framework of Europe’s SESAR Air Traffic Management (ATM) research programme, this aircraft – and others to follow – will take part in the Airbus-led project “Demonstration of air traffic management improvements generated by 4D Initial Trajectory Information Sharing” (DIGITS), which will demonstrate the sharing of an aircraft's predicted trajectory data with air traffic control (ATC).

FANS-C technology will enable airlines to optimise their aircraft’s trajectories and make traffic flows more fluid and aircraft speed easier to manage, which will help them to save fuel and reduce noise. In particular, the sharing of predicted trajectories with ATC controllers will enable smooth aircraft sequencing on approach and in the “Terminal Maneuvering Area.”

Hugh McConnellogue, Group Head of Network Operations at easyJet said: “We are very pleased to be the first airline to receive this new FANS-C technology in our Airbus aircraft – and to try it for real in the SESAR demonstration. Our early hands-on experience already indicates that it promises to be an important enabler to increase the efficiency, safety and on-time performance of our expanding operations – especially in the congested European airspace.”

Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President of Engineering, Airbus Commercial Aircraft said: “We congratulate easyJet on the delivery of the first FANS-C equipped Airbus aircraft, which marks the start of this very large demonstration of 4D initial trajectory sharing across Europe.” He adds: “We are proud to lead this SESAR project and to play our part in helping ATM respond to the increase in air traffic volume while enhancing safety, and to bring about a positive environmental impact thanks to a more efficient ATM system.”

From now until mid-2020, seven European airlines, which are all taking part in DIGITS, will progressively equip up to 100 of their A320 Family aircraft with the FANS-C technology. The “Very Large Demonstration” (VLD) will last more than a year and collect data from over 20,000 revenue flights, allowing stakeholders to demonstrate benefits of this technology during live day-to-day operations.

Paving the way for start of the DIGITS operational phase and to ultimately deploy this technology across Europe and the rest of the world, Airbus achieved the world’s first certification of FANS-C 4D avionics on a commercial aircraft in November 2018 – the initial aircraft type being the A320 Family. Moreover, to complement the airborne FANS-C technology, air navigation service providers (ANSPs) throughout Europe will develop the respective ground ATC tools.

SESAR = Single European Sky ATM Research

Note for editors:

FANS-C is facilitated with two key components: “Automatic Dependent Surveillance Contract” (ADS-C) and “Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication” (CPDLC). ADS-C enables the automatic or on-demand transmission to air traffic control of the aircraft’s complete predicted four-dimensional aircraft trajectory (3D + time), while CPDLC facilitates the digital uplink of ATC orders and clearances. The benefits of FANS-C include: more accurate flight plans, more optimised trajectory computation and acceptance processes, better alignment of airlines’ and ATM planned trajectories, enhancement of aircraft traffic predictions and improvement of demand/capacity network calculations. The seven airlines taking part in the DIGITS programme comprise: Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Iberia, Novair, Thomas Cook and Wizz Air.

For FANS-C capability on-board an A320 Family aircraft, the equipment required includes a new data link router (ATSU), an upgraded Flight Management System (FMS) and “DCDU” data link compatible cockpit displays. FANS-C will be first available on the A320 Family and subsequently on all other Airbus programmes.

Airbus offers a clear competitive advantage thanks to its expertise across a multitude of domains.

With innovation in its DNA, Airbus constantly integrates new technologies into its extensive portfolio – many of which can make a significant difference in the security industry, which faces increasing threats from smuggling, industrial espionage and piracy, illegal entry, natural disasters and various attacks.

New solutions for new and evolving threats

One such project is Styris, Airbus’ product family that implements and delivers turnkey systems covering the full spectrum of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) from both safety and security perspectives. Typical applications are for Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), Coastal Surveillance Systems (CSS) and maritime Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) systems.

In addition, Airbus’ Actacor® product family serves the various operational needs of border (both land and maritime) and critical infrastructure security. The integrated products cover: surveillance platforms and systems, command and control, intelligence operations, information management, facility security, maintenance, repair and overhaul services, and training and simulation.

Another key programme is Zephyr, the world's leading solar-electric, stratospheric unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that will revolutionise security and defence missions all over the world. Zephyr – a High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS) – can fly for months at a time, running exclusively on solar power, above the weather and conventional air traffic. This fills a capability gap that complements satellites, UAVs and manned aircraft in providing persistent local satellite-like services.

Airbus also brings innovation to cybersecurity, applying artificial intelligence to enhance key solutions that protect governments, military, organisations and critical national infrastructure from cyber threats."

Lindsay Cunningham builds impressive career at Airbus Helicopters - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDMvbGluZHNheS1jdW5uaW5naGFtLWJ1aWxkcy1pbXByZXNzaXZlLWNhcmVlci1hdC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Introducing young people to aviation can open up a world of ideas and opportunities that they might not have considered before. For Airbus Helicopters’ head of customer training – North America, Lindsay Cunningham, regular exposure to the industry early in childhood helped inspire her to make education and career decisions that ultimately saw her land the position she holds today.

Growing up, Cunningham’s mom worked part-time for American Airlines, and availed of the flight benefits. “We used to travel quite a bit for standby, which was always an adventure,” she tells Runway Girl Network. A lover of science and math, she decided at the tender age of 12 that aviation was what she wanted to do. “I always loved physics in particular, and geometry, and I had a physics teacher in high school who had an interest in aviation so we kind of talked.”

In high school, Cunningham set her sights on becoming a pilot. “I knew I wanted to become an airline pilot, or thought I wanted to become an airline pilot, so I went to University of Texas first, took as many aviation courses as I could, and knew I had to pursue this at a more aeronautical-based university,” she recalls.

She entered a pilot certification course at Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology in Tulsa, where she became a commercial-instrument rated fixed wing pilot. Thereafter, she transferred to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. But in the wake of 9/11, she had a rethink about flying commercial aircraft for a living. “A year after 9/11, I got my pilot’s license, which was not a good time at all to be going into the airlines. I had several friends that were flying for regional airlines; it was not the life they imagined or the life I imagined. That is when I started thinking about other opportunities in aviation.”

Intrigued by the accident investigation work highlighted on the Discovery Channel, Cunningham started taking more courses on the subject at Embry-Riddle. She graduated with a BS in Professional Aeronautics, and later a Master of Aeronautical Science, Safety Systems & Aerospace Operations from the university. With these degrees under her belt, she obtained an internship at what was then the NTSB’s Southwest Regional Office in Arlington, Texas.

“The regional director at the time went to the same high school I did, so the stars aligned,” says Cunningham, who obtained “really good on-the-job-training”, by going onsite at accidents. But the NTSB regional office was not hiring at the time. “They were not even replacing the people who were hired.”

So, she looked elsewhere. Just over five miles away, the Grand Prairie, Texas-based company then known as American Eurocopter – now known as Airbus Helicopters Inc. – was hiring, and happened to be looking for someone in an entry-level accident investigation position. Before long, Cunningham was working with her new boss at accident sites as an associate accident investigator. She took helicopter-specific accident investigation courses, and also got started on a rotorcraft add-on rating at Longhorn Helicopters, which she completed a few years later.

She served in an accident and investigation role at Airbus Helicopters for more than 11 years, providing onsite support to investigative agencies and supporting other activities to help ensure the safe operation of the Airbus Helicopters product line. The firm’s civilian helicopters range from the light single-engine H125 to the 11-tonne twin-turbine H225 rotorcraft, and military versions are trusted by more than 160 armed forces worldwide.

During her tenure aiding investigations, Cunningham strongly advocated for the proactive use of Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programs to reduce accidents and improve safety.

Explains Cunningham:

While I was at the NTSB, which was relatively a short period of time, nine months, I participated in a couple of investigations that had larger fixed-wing aircraft with FDR and CVR on board and saw the value they offered in an accident investigation. After coming here to do investigations on helicopters – most of which did not have any type of recording devices and the same for lighter, smaller fixed-wing airplanes – I saw that as an opportunity, number one to understand what happened in the event of an accident, but [FDM offers] so much more value than that. When smaller devices became available on the market, I participated in a couple of working groups to develop and promote flight data monitoring equipment and actual programs to improve operational flight safety. So here we worked with a company called Appareo Systems and developed a small FDM Vision 1000, now installed on most Airbus helicopters delivered today.

In 2017, Cunningham was appointed by Airbus Helicopters as VP of civil programs and later as senior manager of ethics & compliance. In January of this year, she officially accepted the position of head of customer training on a long-term basis. In her new role, she leads the customer training department to offer flight and maintenance training to Airbus Helicopters’ North American customer base, “and going beyond just the flight and maintenance training in the future to offer courses that focus more on soft skills safety type stuff that might be of use for our customer base as well, and basically leading that training department.”

“It’s wonderful,” Cunningham says of the job. “I can take all that I learned from accident and investigations and provide a service that allows our customers to operate more safely.”

As a mother of two young girls, she says the job also affords her the ability to achieve a better work/life presence than in her prior position as VP of civil programs, which required a fair amount of travel to Europe. Airbus Helicopters has been “very supportive”, she says. “I’m expecting to travel once every other month in this new role, which will be a huge relief.”

As the need for pilots, technicians and other aviation personnel grows in tandem with the world fleet, it’s understandable why industry is seeking to attract young women to aviation careers. While Cunningham is a big believer in exposing youth to aviation early on, she says it’s ideal to be inclusive irrespective of gender, race or ethnicity.

She doesn’t believe in “pushing women towards technical fields” but rather, providing opportunities to those who show genuine interest.

Did Cunningham ever encounter any pushback or sexism as she pursued her dreams in aviation? Early in her career when she was involved in accident investigations, she recalls that some people “didn’t quite know what to think” of her presence. “But I never really let it bother me too much. I just did my job and acted like everyone else. If you do your job and don’t see yourself as anything else, others will see you the same way.”

And while she admits she has faced minor challenges “those have made me tougher and better at my job and I’m grateful for that.”

The company deployed the first serial aircraft to Rovaniemi in Lapland in February where the test team benefited from a period of exceptionally low temperatures down to -37°C (-35°F). The main objective of this second campaign was to confirm the excellent behaviour of the H160 in extremely cold conditions with its serial configuration as the first test campaign in Canada was performed with a prototype aircraft.

The campaign included over 20 hours of flight tests as well as a lengthy series of ground tests and a 13-hour ferry flight from Airbus Helicopters’ Marignane base to the test site.

Airbus Helicopters Head of H160 Program, Bernard Fujarski said: “This was a highly productive test programme. The colder the temperatures in which we can successfully fly and operate, the colder the temperatures in which our customers can carry out their work. We have been very happy with the freezing conditions in Lapland and overall with the behaviour of H160.”

Airbus has more than 330 highly skilled employees in Finland, primarily in research and development, engineering and project management and notably in mission-critical communications. Its commercial aircraft form the backbone of Finnair’s airliner fleet and its helicopters serve on EMS operations and with the Finnish Border Guard.

Lufthansa's Airbus A350-900 flagship aircraft flies to Charlotte Douglas International Airport for the first time - Lufthansa Group,"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWZ0aGFuc2Fncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbWVkaWEtcmVsYXRpb25zLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy1hbmQtcmVsZWFzZXMvbHVmdGhhbnNhcy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC05MDAtZmxhZ3NoaXAtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmxpZXMtdG8tY2hhcmxvdHRlLWRvdWdsYXMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0LWZvci10aGUtZmlyc3QtdGltZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Lufthansa’s Flight LH428 touches down at Charlotte Douglas International Airport on March 31, 2019, it will mark the first time an Airbus A350-900, the world’s most state-of-the-art, long-haul aircraft, arrives in this city. It will also mark 15 years of Lufthansa service on the Charlotte – Munich route.

Charlotte, NC, will join an exclusive roster of North American cities that Lufthansa connects to Munich with its new flagship long-haul aircraft that includes Boston, Denver, Chicago O’Hare, Newark and Vancouver.

Flight LH428 departs from Munich at 12:45 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Charlotte on March 31, 2019 at 4:25 p.m. local time. The return flight, LH429, will depart from Charlotte at 6:30 p.m. and will arrive in Munich at 9:00 a.m. on the following day. All times are local. This flight between Charlotte and Munich will travel daily.

Furthermore, 15 years ago, on March 26, 2004, Lufthansa began operating the Charlotte – Munich route. In 2004, an Airbus A340-300 served the route and flew daily between Charlotte and Munich. Due to increased customer demand, in the summer of 2008, the aircraft was upgraded to an Airbus A340-600, which was, at the time, the largest aircraft to serve the city. On Sunday, March 31st, Lufthansa’s flagship aircraft, the Airbus A350-900, will begin to operate the Charlotte – Munich route and fly seven times per week to the capital of Bavaria in South Germany.

“We’re thrilled to start operating the Charlotte – Munich route with our most innovative and modern aircraft. With the already strong ties between Charlotte and Germany, Lufthansa is happy to further strengthen this relationship by offering passengers a flight experience on the A350-900 that is unlike any other,” said Larry Ryan, Senior Director, Sales USA of the Lufthansa Group. “The 15 year anniversary and the beginning of our A350 service to Charlotte continue to display the commitment we have to the U.S., as it is our single most important market outside of Europe.”

A350-900

The Airbus A350-900 is the world's most advanced, environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft. It uses 25 percent less kerosene, produces 25 percent fewer emissions and is significantly quieter on take-off. The aircraft has space for 293 passengers with 48 seats in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class. At just under 5.6 meters wide (18.4 feet), the cabin of the new Airbus is more spacious than comparable models of aircraft.

Lufthansa’s A350-900 also offers an exceptionally pleasant cabin environment that makes the journey on board the aircraft even more satisfying. In Business Class,

passengers enjoy a self-service area where they can easily help themselves to snacks and drinks throughout the flight.

The Premium Economy Class offers much more than merely a comfortable seat. Passengers can check in two pieces of luggage at no charge, each with an allowable weight of up to 22.7 kilograms (50 lbs). Travelers can conveniently select their favorite food from the menu card, and the food is served on porcelain dishes.

The award-winning Economy Class, furnished in various shades of blue, features special ergonomically-formed seat upholstery and provides travelers with more personal and storage space. The A350 Economy Class was conceived by the design bureau, PearsonLloyd, and was awarded the German Design Award 2018 by the German Design Council.

Throughout the cabin, passengers can use their own mobile device as a second screen, as well as pre-selected programs from the on-board entertainment system, up to six weeks prior to flight time.

Due to the aircraft’s particular construction, passengers reach their destination feeling more well-rested. This is achieved through improved cabin pressure during the flight, as well as a novel LED lighting system that adjusts with the day and night-time rhythm of the passengers.

Kymeta and Airbus demonstrate 'SmartBus' satellite links in Peru - GeekWire,"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE5L2t5bWV0YS1haXJidXMtZ28tcm9hZC1wZXJ1LWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlLXNtYXJ0YnVzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1saW5rcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kymeta Corp., the Redmond, Wash.-based company backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and other investors, has demonstrated the performance of its flat-panel satellite antennas in an unlikely setting: on top of buses traveling throughout Peru.

With the aid of partners including Intelsat, Cubic Telecom and Cradlepoint, Kymeta worked with Airbus to create a pilot project called SmartBus. The project involved outfitting interprovincial buses operated by TEPSA — the Peruvian analog to Greyhound Lines — with Kymeta’s satellite terminals.

SmartBus is designed to gather up-to-the-minute data on road safety and other indicators to improve Peru’s transportation system while connecting people in remote areas of the country.

The system leverages satellite bandwidth capacity from Intelsat, cellular coverage from Cubic Telecom and a software-defined WAN solution from Cradlepoint to establish real-time data connections along a 460-mile bus route through Peru.

The World Bank and Peru’s Ministry of Transport and Communications lended crucial support to SmartBus.

“This project is making a tangible contribution to development by connecting people in an extremely difficult geographical region of Peru,” Alberto Rodríguez, director of the World Bank for Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, said in a news release. “The critical insights we unearth from this trial will be used by research centers, universities and leading technology companies, helping them to identify problems and possible solutions relating to road safety, meteorology and transport logistics.”

Kymeta said the SmartBus pilot project could open the way to a variety of industry applications for its mobile connectivity platform, including commercial agriculture, fleet management, public transportation and emergency response.

“We are an end-to-end services provider with reliable mobile connectivity that also captures mission-critical data for a variety of industries,” said Benjamin Posthuma, Kymeta’s connectivity solutions manager. “With Kymeta, users no longer need to choose between satellite and cellular – they are just connected.”

Kymeta also announced the release of a white paper titled “A Hybrid Network Solution for Reliable, Wide-Coverage First Responder Communications.” The white paper highlights two field trials demonstrating how satellite-cellular hybrid networks can add resiliency to communication systems for first responders in the face of infrastructure failures and network congestion.

Kymeta’s flat-panel antenna takes advantage of metamaterials, specially designed electronic arrays that make it possible to “steer” the antennas using software rather than mechanical movements. The company was spun out from Bellevue, Wash.-based Intellectual Ventures and made its public debut in 2012.

In addition to Bill Gates, Kymeta’s investors include Intelsat, Lux Capital and Liberty Global. Total investment is thought to amount to more than $200 million.

Over the years, Kymeta has partnered with Intelsat and Airbus as well as other big-name players, such as Microsoft, Nomad GCS, Toyota, Inmarsat and Honeywell Aerospace, Panasonic, Sharp and Aurum Security. In league with Intelsat, Kymeta began offering a mobile satellite data service called KĀLO in 2017. The company is also selling antennas for satellite communication at sea as well as for field applications ranging from construction site management to emergency response."
"Boeing is in crisis, but it is doing just fine in its race with Airbus - CNN","Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8yNi9idXNpbmVzcy9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATlodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDE5LzAzLzI2L2J1c2luZXNzL2JvZWluZy1haXJidXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN Business —

Boeing remains competitive with its biggest rival, Airbus, even as Boeing faces one of its worst crises ever.

After two fatal crashes in five months, Boeing’s bestselling 737 Max was grounded two weeks ago. Chinese airlines ordered 300 Airbus jets on Monday — a big win for Airbus and a defeat for Boeing. The 737 Max competes directly with Airbus’ A320, which made up the bulk of the Chinese airlines’ purchase.

But Boeing and its 737 Max plane will make out OK in the end.

Most experts assume the 737 Max will return to its normal sales demand once Boeing comes up with a software upgrade in the coming weeks. Boeing believes that will fix the automatic safety feature that is the focus of the two crash investigations.

Last year, Boeing had 675 net orders for 737 Max jets, adding 13 new clients for the plane. That beat out 541 net orders for the different versions of the Airbus A320. But Airbus has about 6,000 A320 jets in its order backlog, compared to Boeing’s backlog of roughly 5,000 orders for the 737.

The competition between the two single aisle jets is pretty close to a dead heat, with Airbus slightly ahead, said Cowen analyst Cai von Rumhor.

“It’s a duopoly. Both are doing well. Both have a great big backlog,” he said.

The two aircraft makers fight fiercely for orders, but once an airline makes its choice of manufacturer in a certain class of aircraft, it’s not easy to switch. Training for pilots, mechanics and the supply of spare parts to keep the planes in the air mean the airlines would have a significantly higher cost if they tried to switch.

Airbus’ long backlog of A320 jets orders would also discourage a current 737 Max customer from switching to the A320.

Since the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, only one customer — Indonesia airline Garuda — has canceled an order for the 737 Max. The 50 planes in that order were worth an estimated $4.9 billion. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumhor said the cancellation was mostly a result of Garuda’s own problems: The airline was losing money and was seeking to delay those plane orders even before the most recent 737 Max crash.

Boeing is continuing to build the 737 Max at its previous pace of 52 planes a month since the grounding of all the aircraft. Airbus is building 60 of the A320.

Airlines pay about 60% of the cost of an aircraft upon delivery. The halt of 737 Max deliveries could mean a $5 billion hit in Boeing revenue in the first quarter, according to von Rumhor. But he expects almost all that lost revenue will be made up in subsequent quarters.

The cost of the fix and compensating airlines for the grounded planes will leave more of an impact — about $2 billion after insurance, he said. But he doesn’t think there will be long-term damage to the sales from the current crisis.

The large Airbus order from China was probably in the works for at least six months, maybe as much of the year, von Rumohr estimates. That means talks on the sale started even before the first 737 Max crash of a Lion Air jet in late October.

He believes the timing of the sales is more about the politics of China’s ongoing trade talks with the Trump administration than anything else. He pointed out that China was the first country to ground the Boeing jets after the Ethiopian airlines crash. It also pulled the 737 Max airworthiness certificate from the 737 Max on Tuesday, even though the planes were already grounded.

“I see that as a very politically motivated move. This is about China trying to get leverage in talks. This is the quid pro quo for Huawei,” he said, referring to the Chinese electronics company which has been at the center of the a separate dispute between the two countries."
JetBlue introduces new cabin experience on Airbus A320 aircraft - Aviation24.be,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvamV0Ymx1ZS9pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLW5ldy1jYWJpbi1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvamV0Ymx1ZS9pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLW5ldy1jYWJpbi1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue today announced that its newest cabin experience has entered into service, bringing to the skies the widest seats available for this aircraft, custom-designed seat-back in-flight entertainment (IFE) with 100+ channels of DIRECTV and hundreds of free movies and shows, ability to pair your mobile device to the screen, easy-to-reach power sources at every seat, and expanded coverage of free Wi-Fi connectivity almost everywhere JetBlue flies. JetBlue’s Airbus A320 aircraft, which make up the majority of the airline’s fleet, are being updated for the first time since the airline disrupted the industry with onboard live television and all-leather seats in 2000.

The restyling effort has been several years in the making, with the latest aircraft marking the first to receive this all-new 2019 design. The aircraft, named “If You Can Read This, You’re Blue Close,” re-joins JetBlue’s fleet today, with roughly a third of JetBlue’s A320 aircraft scheduled for restyling completion by the end of the year.

“JetBlue rocked the airline industry in 2000 with seatback television and all leather seats. In our first makeover since, this incredible new onboard experience represents what the founders would have done if they were launching JetBlue today,” said Marty St. George, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, JetBlue. “The new experience brings together technology, entertainment, and comfort with the great service JetBlue customers love so much.”

For most of the airlines 100+ destinations the A320 restyling will bring the upgraded JetBlue experience to their city for the first time.

A major focus of the restyling is keeping customers connected throughout their flight, including a new inflight entertainment system, high-definition seatback televisions, in-seat power outlets with USB ports and continued free gate-to-gate Fly-Fi high-speed internet with an expanded coverage area – including throughout the Caribbean and Latin America where Fly-Fi had not been available until now.

The Widest Seat Available For the A320

In 2019, JetBlue will outfit its A320 aircraft with the Collins Meridian seat, customized for the airline’s needs and featuring a number of design elements with customer comfort in mind:

Expanded seat width of more than 18 inches, the widest available for the A320.

The most legroom in coach of any U.S. airline (a).

Enhanced cushion comfort.

Adjustable headrests, a new feature for JetBlue’s A320.

Contoured seatback design at knee level creating additional living space for every customer.

Redesigned seatback stowage options, including an innovative elastic grid to accommodate a variety of customer items.

At least two easy-to-reach power connections at every seat.

“We are proud to partner with JetBlue on its A320 restyling project by supplying our Meridian Seat,” said Cynthia A. Muklevicz, Vice President, Account Management, Interiors for Collins Aerospace. “Meridian offers passengers industry-leading comfort and living space through an intense focus on ergonomic design supported by optimization of the underlying seat structure.”

IFE

Also in 2019, JetBlue will build on its reputation as an industry leader in inflight entertainment options with Thales AVANT and ViaSat-2 connectivity. With this system, JetBlue will offer customers aboard its restyled A320s expanded entertainment choices in nearly every region the airline flies. JetBlue is the only major U.S. airline with seatback entertainment screens at every seat on every aircraft.

10.1 inch, 1080P high definition screen at every seat.

More than 100 channels of live television with DVR-like pause and rewind functionality.

Expanded collection of on demand movies, TV shows and video content, plus new gaming features.

Destination-specific content allowing customers to enhance their travel experience.

Picture-in-picture function

Enhanced, 3D flight map offering multiple ways to track time to destination.

Completing The 2018 Phase

The first phase of JetBlue’s A320 interior cabin restyle began in spring 2018 and modernized the airline’s so-called “classic interiors” with products that matched those found on the airline’s newer A321 aircraft – features such as more modern seats and larger seatback TVs. More than a dozen A320 aircraft have been restyled with these products so far and several more are scheduled for completion in the coming weeks. This spring the restyling will fully transition to the 2019 version of onboard products for all aircraft going forward."
"Satellite payload startup raises $12.4 million from Airbus Ventures, other investors - SpaceNews","Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zYXRlbGxpdGUtcGF5bG9hZC1zdGFydHVwLXJhaXNlcy0xMi00LW1pbGxpb24tZnJvbS1haXJidXMtdmVudHVyZXMtb3RoZXItaW52ZXN0b3JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Cesium Astro, a startup building advanced antennas and communications systems for satellites, raised $12.4 million in a Series A round led by Airbus’ venture capital arm Airbus Ventures.

Honeywell Ventures also participated in the round alongside Analog Devices Ventures, Franklin Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins and Lavrock Ventures, the startup said March 13.

Based in Austin, Texas, Cesium Astro formed in 2017 and has raised just over $14 million to date, Founder and CEO Shey Sabripour said in an interview.

Sabripour, a former spacecraft design engineer at Lockheed Martin, said his company has secured rides to space for demonstration phased array antenna systems, and anticipates testing them in orbit in roughly a year.

Breakthroughs in phased array antennas have become a major focus for satellite ground equipment as a means to connect to multiple satellites at once, but in-space use of such antennas is also getting more attention. Boeing has described the payload for SES’s future O3b mPower system as using a “highly integrated electronics phased-array payload system.” Eutelsat’s upcoming Quantum satellite that Airbus Defence and Space is building includes an onboard phased array to reshape communications beams, enabling adjustments to their size, shape, power and location.

Satellite broadband customers like airlines and cruise ships have compelled satellite operators to design spacecraft with responsive capacity that can move with traffic.

“With traditional fixed beam satellites, the power that goes through a channel is fixed, regardless of if someone is using it or not,” Sabripour said. “You are still illuminating that part of the Earth with capacity that you paid a lot of money to get in orbit. With phased arrays that power can be distributed to dynamically to where customers are.”

Cesium Astro is building onboard spacecraft antennas and full spacecraft payloads that it can sell at “an order of magnitude” below other phased array systems, he said.

The first frequencies it will focus on are Ku-, Ka, and S-band, he said, followed by L-band, X-band and the largely unused frequencies above Ka-band where satellite operators are just beginning to invest in new technologies.

Sabripour said Cesium Astro’s antennas can go on Earth-observation satellites to enable uplink and downlink for imagery and other data. Drones can also use Cesium Astro’s technology for communications, he said.

Cesium Astro customers include NASA, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Navy, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Northrop Grumman. Sabripour said the company aims to sell antennas and payload technology to satellite manufacturers and operators.

With its new funding, Sabripour said Cesium Astro plans to increase its headcount from 12 people to between 35 and 45 by the second quarter of 2020."

Airbus agreed to reimburse the loans, together with interest, but payments were tied to A380 deliveries that began in 2007. The company announced last month that it would halt production of the world’s biggest passenger jet in 2021, putting the countries at risk of not getting back the remaining principal."
Inside JetBlue's First 'Phase 2' Retrofitted Airbus A320 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2pldGJsdWUtcmV0cm9maXR0ZWQtYTMyMC10b3VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue's fleet is certainly getting up there in age. The airline's first Airbus A320, N503JB, was delivered way back in 1999, and is still flying for the carrier today. Soon, however, passengers boarding even the oldest aircraft in the carrier's fleet will feel like they're traveling on a brand-new plane, thanks to a massive fleet-wide overhaul program aimed at bringing the carrier's workhorse aircraft up to date.

JetBlue is undergoing a two-stage retrofit process, with 15 aircraft now complete as part of ""Phase 1,"" and the first ""Phase 2"" A320 re-entering service any day. While the first batch represented a huge improvement overall — adding the airline's A321 seat to a handful of older A320s — the latest-generation retrofit has landed JetBlue a truly industry-leading narrow-body plane, as I experienced during a pre-launch visit at the airline's Lake City, Florida (LCQ) contractor facility this week.

Cabin Overview

As part of the retrofit, JetBlue is adding two rows of seats, for a total of 162, up from 150 on the original A320 configuration. As a result, the carrier is adding a fourth cabin crew member as well, with a total of four flight attendants working the cabin.

The cabin now features a slick low-light mode, enabling this cool blue glow on nighttime flights.

You'll find the two extra rows of seats at the rear of the cabin, replacing the lavatories on the older configuration (don't worry, they've just been moved). The one notable downside here is that row 26 only offers one window, while the last row in the cabin, 27, doesn't have any at all.

All seats are arranged in a 3-3 configuration, and offer a whopping 18.4 inches of width. Pitch has been reduced slightly to 32 inches in most rows, with 35 inches in Even More Space, though a slimmer seat design means the difference should hardly be noticeable — that was my experience, at least.

There's a large lavatory just behind the cockpit — if you're seated near the front of the plane, that's the one I'd pick.

The rear lavatories, meanwhile, have been moved to the rear galley. They're still decently spacious — especially the one on the left.

Seats and Amenities

N729JB is the first JetBlue aircraft to feature Collins Aerospace's Meridian seat. Despite the slim-line design, I found them to be really comfortable, thanks to the airline's decision to add memory foam padding.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

These seats also offer fully adjustable headrests, making them far more comfortable when it comes time to sleep. They have an entirely different look, too, with orange accents highlighting the Even More Space (extra-legroom) seats, for example.

Each passenger has access to a 10.1-inch in-flight entertainment system, and a full-size fold-down tray table.

There are also two water bottle pockets, plus this nifty holder, which makes it easy to secure small items (a charging smartphone, perhaps) with elastic straps.

Finally, JetBlue slightly reduced the recline, making it easier to use a laptop even when the passenger in front is leaning all the way back. (Thanks to Eric Dunetz for snapping this photo!)

In-Flight Entertainment

JetBlue opted for the Thales AVANT seat-back entertainment system — the same model you'll find on the latest long-haul aircraft, flying with carriers ranging from American Airlines to Emirates.

In addition to touchscreen support (no armrest controllers here!), JetBlue was able to fully customize the Android-based interface, starting the experience with a fun personality-identifying quiz that offers up content suggestions based on the options you select.

You can also access the full list of movies and TV shows, of course — everything's available free of charge, and the films I tried looked great, with an HD-quality image. This version of JetBlue's IFE also offers 100+ channels of free DirecTV with a new DVR-like feature that lets you pause and re-start programming.

In addition to USB power ports below the display, every row now offers universal power outlets — one for every seat in Even More Space rows, and two for each set of three seats throughout the rest of the plane.

This is also the first aircraft to feature an updated version of JetBlue's free gate-to-gate Fly-Fi internet service, which connects to the new ViaSat-2 satellite, delivering more bandwidth and much-expanded coverage, including almost all of Central America, the Caribbean and even parts of South America.

Bottom Line

I flew JetBlue's original A320 configuration from New York-JFK to Jacksonville (JAX) and back to check out this first refurbished plane, and as much as I loved the aircraft's thick leather seats, the seat-back entertainment and the cabin overall felt quite dated, especially after seeing the refreshed version in Florida.

With the first 'Phase 2' retrofitted A320 expected to re-enter service later this week — and up to seven aircraft progressing through the process each month — frequent JetBlue flyers should have a chance to experience the updated interior for themselves soon."
"China's Xi sees honors, Airbus deal in state visit to France - The Associated Press","Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2E2ODE2NmQ4YzgxNzQ5Nzc4NDc1MGRjNjg0NDZmNGQx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping received the full honors of a formal reception during a state visit to France on Monday that included attending the signing of a multi-billion dollar deal between European aircraft maker Airbus to China.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Xi’s official visit was an “excellent signal” of the strength and reliability of relations between China and France. Appearing with the Chinese leader at the presidential Elysee Palace, Macron said the two countries want to build a “strong Euro-Chinese partnership, based on clear, strict and ambitious rules.”

Xi, who plans to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Paris on Tuesday, said China “attaches great importance” to its relations with Europe.

European leaders want to increase trade with China, albeit on European terms, amid trade tensions between the United States and both China and the European Union.

The Airbus sale Xi saw finalized involves the sale of 300 airplanes. The China Aviation Supplies Holding Company has ordered 290 Airbus A320 and 10 Airbus A350, according to a statement from the French presidency.

The price was not specified. The sale is estimated to be worth 30 billion euros ($34 billion) at list prices, although buyers often secure discounts.

“We are honored to support the growth of China’s civil aviation with our leading aircraft families,” said Guillaume Faury, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “Our expanding footprint in China demonstrates our lasting confidence in the Chinese market and our long-term commitment to China and our partners.”

Other major business deals on renewable energy and the food industry were signed Monday, in addition to bilateral agreements.

Both leaders agreed on a protocol allowing the French exports of chicken meat to China. The country opened its market to French beef products following Macron’s January 2018 state visit to China.

French energy company EDF and the China Energy Investment Corporation signed a deal worth 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to deliver two offshore wind farms in Chinese waters.

EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said the deal “consolidates EDF’s foothold in China.”

Macron said during his appearance alongside Xi that China and France share views on the importance of combating climate change, with green investments abroad making up part of the strategy.

Earlier in the day, the French leader welcomed Xi and his wife, Peng Liuan, at the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris. The French National Guard played the country’s anthems. Both leaders laid a wreath at the Unknown Soldier from World War I whose tomb is under the monument.

On Monday night, the Chinese president was honored with a state dinner at the Elysee Palace. The guests included French actor Alain Delon, Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, French-Chinese painter Yan Pei-Ming and Chinese actress Gong Li.

Xi and Macron also confirmed the opening of a branch of the Pompidou Center, a modern art museum in Paris, in Shanghai this fall.

Xi started his trip to Europe last week, signing deals in Italy and heading to Monaco on Sunday to ink more. He arrived in France on Sunday evening where he had a private dinner with Macron in the resort town of Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera."
Airbus Helicopters announces Maximum Pilot View Kit partnership - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWFubm91bmNlcy1tYXhpbXVtLXBpbG90LXZpZXcta2l0LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Maximum Pilot View Kit (MPVK) will now be offered as an option during manufacture of the Airbus H125, following a new partnership agreement between Airbus Helicopters and MPVK developer Swiss Rotor Solutions.

The MPVK includes a single-piece right-hand side bubble door and lower vertical window, cut into the right-hand floor of the fuselage. It is designed to help aerial work operators, increasing their field of view below by a factor of 10.

The partnership, announced during Helicopter Association International Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia, will also see the MPVK offered through Airbus as a kit for retrofit.

The kit was certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2017.

“Our own test pilots have flown on an aircraft with the MPVK to confirm that it’s safe [and] it works,” said Axel Aloccio, head of Airbus’s intermediate single program. “We’re confident it will bring value to our aerial customers in order to improve safety, [and] to really improve your [field] of vision.”

The partnership will take immediate effect, with Airbus ready to take orders to install the kits on production line aircraft and for retrofit.

During a media briefing ahead of Heli-Expo, Aloccio also revealed that Airbus is working on a reduced-size instrument panel that will also help improve the field of vision for H125 operators.

“We are going to keep the same avionics . . . but [we] are going to pack it into a much smaller instrument panel, which is basically half the size of the current instrument panel,” he said. “We believe it will interest a lot our aerial customers, because it reduces by half the size of the instrument panel and therefore you have way more visibility outside.”

Currently referred to in-house as the “lean panel” (the name may change), the slimmed-down panel will be offered as an option, with certification planned for the end of this year."

Konnichiwa! All Nippon Airways receives its initial A380 - Airbus,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLWtvbm5pY2hpd2EtYWxsLW5pcHBvbi1haXJ3YXlzLXJlY2VpdmVzLWl0cy1pbml0aWFsLWEzODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ANA becomes Japan’s first carrier with Airbus’ double-deck jetliner and joins airlines that use A380s to serve the Tokyo Narita – Honolulu route

Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) today took delivery of its initial A380, which will serve the popular Japan-to-Hawaii routing – and is appropriately painted in a special livery depicting the Hawaiian Green Sea Turtle, also known as the Honu.

ANA becomes the world’s 15th operator – and Japan’s first – of this widebody passenger aircraft. It has ordered a total of three A380s.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the jetliner features ANA’s very latest in-flight entertainment systems, as well as full connectivity in all classes. It will enable the airline to almost double the capacity between Japan and the U.S. island state of Hawaii, generating value for the airline.

As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, the A380 will be operated on ANA’s popular Japan-to-Hawaii route.

“This marks a new milestone in our relationship with ANA – our longest-standing customer in Japan,” said Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, during today’s delivery ceremony at Toulouse, France. “We are confident the A380 will be a huge success in service with All Nippon Airways, and we remain committed to supporting the airline’s A380 operation – as we will for all operators of this magnificent aircraft.”

Each of ANA’s A380s will feature the special livery depicting the Hawaiian Green Sea Turtle. The no. 1 aircraft is blue, the second will be green and the third orange. This elaborate paint scheme covers a surface of 3,600 square metres and took the Airbus team 21 days to paint, using 16 different shades of colour.

The first of three A380s ordered by Japan’s All Nippon Airways was delivered to this Japanese carrier on 20 March 2019 during a ceremony at the Airbus delivery centre, located adjacent to France’s Toulouse-Blagnac Airport

With this character design of Honu, All Nippon Airways aims to raise awareness about environmental issues and contribute to saving sea turtles and the environment.

- Shohei Hattori, ANA Corporate Planning Manager

“Customers around the world were asked to create an attractive design to be painted on Japan's first A380 as part of a contest – and the Honu, a symbol of good luck and prosperity in Hawaii, was among the numerous ideas,” explained Shohei Hattori, the ANA Corporate Planning Manager.

The first of three A380s ordered by Japan’s All Nippon Airways was delivered to this Japanese carrier on 20 March 2019 during a ceremony at the Airbus delivery centre, located adjacent to France’s Toulouse-Blagnac Airport

Airbus’ longstanding relationship with Japan

The relationship between Airbus and Japan’s All Nippon Airways began in 1986, when the airline placed its first order for 20 single-aisle A320s, the first of which entered service in 1991. Since then, ANA has operated a fleet of A320 Family aircraft, consistently ranking among the top Airbus operators for technical performance and achieving more than 99.5% operational reliability with its latest A321neo fleet.

In recent years, Airbus also extended its operator base in Japan with ANA subsidiaries Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air, both of which exclusively fly Airbus A320 Family aircraft.

At the end of 2018, Airbus reached a milestone with 100 of its aircraft in Japanese operators’ service, representing 20% of total fleet flying in the country – with a target to reach 30% by 2020, and 50% in the long term.

The no. 1 A380 for ANA was assembled at Airbus’ industrial facility in the Toulouse region of France, and departed from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport for its delivery flight to Japan

The unique A380 experience

More than 230 A380s have been delivered to 15 airlines worldwide, with the jetliners operated on 120-plus routes and 60 destinations.

An estimated 250 million passengers already have flown aboard the double-deck aircraft – and people actively seek out A380 flights for the unique travel experience. To assist passengers, Airbus created a dedicated iflyA380 website, where travellers can search and book their preferred flights – which now also include those operated by ANA.

Some 50% of weekly global A380 flights take place in Asia-Pacific – with flights performed within the region, to or from it, demonstrating that the jetliner offers the best solution for traffic growth in Asia.

As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger aircraft, the A380 is a favourite among travellers, with unmatched comfort and wider seats. For airlines, the jetliner has the lowest cost per seat of any competing widebody, delivering comfort and economic benefits and maximising revenue. With passenger traffic doubling every 15 years, the A380 is the solution to transportation growth and airport congestion, carrying more people with fewer flights at lower cost and reduced emissions."

The H145: from Bluecopter to the big-time - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLXRoZS1oMTQ1LWZyb20tYmx1ZWNvcHRlci10by10aGUtYmlnLXRpbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H145 surprised even its engineers with the qualities of its new main rotor. Below, the story behind the rotor’s development, and how it ended up on the H145.

At Heli-Expo 2019, some of the buzz has been focused around Airbus’ H145 and its brand-new rotor. Five bladed, bearingless, with a smaller hinge offset . . . the innovations packed into this single element are more than we usually see revealed on an aircraft.

First prototype

The H145’s rotor actually started life on Airbus’ Bluecopter technology demonstrator. This re-engineered H135 was unveiled in 2015 as the company’s test bed for new technology, kitted out with such innovations as a new Fenestron tail rotor, a T-tail, and a bearingless 5-bladed main rotor.

“The Bluecopter was a highly modified H135 with a larger rotor diameter than a normal H135. Its ride and comfort were so good that we had the idea to strap it onto an H145 and see what it would do,” says Carl Ockier, the H145’s flight test engineer.

Overwhelming results

“We started with lower aircraft weights and incrementally increased. And all of a sudden, we found out that this rotor seemed to be perfect for the H145,” says Alexander Neuhaus, the test pilot on the Bluecopter and H145. “We were surprised, because although the rotor was not designed for the H145’s weight and aircraft type, by just taking it off the H135 and putting it on the H145 the result was overwhelming. That ended with the decision to go on with testing.”

There was little more to be done. The programme ran calculations and did simulations to make sure the rotor could withstand the H145’s flight load. Small modifications followed and then the H145’s testing campaigns began to certify the new rotor.

We were surprised, because although the rotor was not designed for the H145’s weight and aircraft type, by just taking it off the H135 and putting it on the H145 the result was overwhelming.

Rather than be stuck alone in my seat, I opted to hang out at the bar for a few hours, getting to know other passengers and flight attendants — and getting a drink or snack at my leisure.

For many travel junkies, flying in business class on an Airbus A380 operated by Emirates is considered the crème de la crème of flight experiences.

Until last month, I'd never flown in business class before; it never made sense for my budget.

But then, thanks to Airbus' announcement that in 2021 it will stop producing the A380, the world's largest and most expensive passenger plane, my editors thought I had to try flying back to New York in business class on an Emirates A380, for $5,400.

I didn't know what to expect. I'd had an excellent experience flying Emirates in economy class to Dubai in November, but I'd heard mixed reviews about business class. I was worried that all it would mean was a slightly bigger seat and better airplane food.

I was very wrong. While Emirates' business class blew my mind for many reasons — the food, the lounge, and the pod-like seats among them — my favorite part was the plane's famous walk-up cocktail lounge.

I had heard about the lounge, as many travel experts and frequent fliers consider it the centerpiece of the Emirates business-class experience. But I was skeptical.

I kept wondering: Does anyone actually use it, or is it a gimmick that looks better in a travel magazine?

I got my first taste of the cocktail lounge a few hours after takeoff. Dinner was over, and I was looking for a sweet snack to eat while I watched a TV show.

One of the best parts about the lounge is that it's stocked with fresh fruits, sandwiches, pastries, chips, and other goodies you can grab at your leisure. I took a bag of cherries and a bottle of water and went back to my seat.

The convenience was great, but it was how much fun the lounge was that showed me what a game-changer it is for travel.

Throughout the flight — and I was on a red-eye — there were always a few passengers there chatting or, more often, talking with the staff.

After sleeping for a few hours, I went into the lounge to stretch my legs and found a group of passengers drinking at the bar and having a conversation with the flight attendant/bartender. I had intended to grab a water bottle and head back to my seat. Instead, I spent three hours hanging out there with passengers and flight attendants.

The flight attendants told us about the worst passengers they've had to deal with, wild things that have happened on board, and what they like to do in their free time. The other passengers and I shared stories from our travels and recommendations for New York and Dubai, and got to know one another.

Halfway through, the bartender mixed an experimental drink at my request, turning the cucumber-fizz mocktail into an alcoholic drink. It was delicious.

A passenger I met told me about how on his flight to Dubai a few weeks before, he and a half-dozen others hung out in the lounge during the Super Bowl, cheering on their team as they used the airplane WiFi to get updates on the score. It sounded like a blast.

As I left the plane the following morning, I was still amazed at how much fun my flight had been. An open social space creates a totally different atmosphere for the passengers and, I imagine, the staff.

The next time you think about splurging on a business-class flight, look for an airline with an onboard lounge — Emirates is far from the only one."
Starlux places firm order for Airbus A350 aircraft - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8xOS9zdGFybHV4LXBsYWNlcy1maXJtLW9yZGVyLWZvci1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Starlux places firm order for Airbus A350 aircraft

Starlux Airlines has placed a firm order for 17 Airbus A350 aircraft following its earlier commitment during the 2018 Farnborough International Airshow.

The order is made up of 12 of the larger A350-1000s and five of the smallest member, the A350-900, all of which are exclusively powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

K.W. Chang, Founder and Chairman of the new airline, reflected on the order in the following statement:

“We are very glad to sign the official purchase agreement today for Airbus widebodies. The A350s combination of extra-long range capability, significantly lower operating costs and high passenger comfort were key factors in our decision.”

He added:

“Starlux is committed to becoming one of the best airlines in the world. We are positive that with the A350 XWB, we will be able to spread our wings to further destinations, bringing our best-in-class services to more people over the world in the near future.”

Being 45 tonnes lighter than its competitor, the Airbus A350 will allow Starlux to operate flights to the US East Coast non-stop. From Taipei, the airline is set to launch flights to Europe and North America as well as certain destinations through the Asia-Pacific.

At the end of February of 2019, the Airbus A350 has gathered 852 firm orders from 48 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft in the world."

Airbus Helicopters to offer CRFS at cost; expands certification to older AS350/EC130 types - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLW9mZmVyLWNyZnMtYXQtY29zdC1leHBhbmRzLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24tdG8tb2xkZXItdHlwZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is to expand certification of its Crash Resistant Fuel System (CRFS) to the AS350 B3 and EC130 B4 helicopters, and when certified, the kit will be offered at cost to operators.

It will also be expanding its policy of installing the CRFS in newly-produced H125s. Currently, this is only standard in H125s manufactured in the U.S.; operators taking delivery of the aircraft from the company’s production line at its headquarters in Marignane, France, have the CRFS installation available as an option. Standard installation on all newly-produced will begin with aircraft manufactured in 2020.

The Airbus CRFS is already certified for the latest generation of the AS350 — the H125 — and is part of a standard production H130, the most modern variant of the EC130. But those who operate legacy variants of the types are currently reliant on a third party if they want to install a CRFS; Robertson Fuel Systems and StandardAero certified their CRFS for use in the models in December 2017.

While Airbus said there is a global fleet of around 1,500 AS350 B3s and 400 EC130 B4s, the company estimates that as few as 200 CRFS have been purchased for installation on these types.

According to Airbus, the Robertson/StandardAero CRFS is typically sold at between $100,000 to $120,000, excluding labor cost. Airbus will be offering its CRFS for the H125, AS350 B3 and EC130 B4 for $44,000.

“We found that the main barrier for customers to install the CRFS was price — it was cost,” said Axel Aloccio, head of Airbus’s intermediate single program. “So we are doing our best to incentivize our customers to go for the CRFS.”

The company’s announcement comes just over a year after five sightseeing passengers died following the fiery crash of a Papillon Airways-operated EC130 B4 in the Grand Canyon, bringing the issue of post-crash fires back into sharp focus.

In the following weeks, the parents of one of the passengers filed a lawsuit against the operator and Airbus, highlighting the lack of a CRFS in the accident aircraft.

The lawyer in that case had also represented David Repsher, the Flight For Life nurse who was severely burned following the crash of an H125, and who later received a $100 million settlement from Airbus and Air Methods Corporation.

However, Aloccio said the key driver behind Airbus’s decision to expand the CRFS certification and offer it at cost was simply a desire to improve the safety of the AStar fleet.

“We want to encourage our customers to make sure that they equip their aircraft with a CRFS because, beyond the legal action or the bad publicity for us, we are convinced it’s a good safety feature to invest on the aircraft,” he said. “We are not them. We cannot invest for them into a CRFS, but we feel that we have to do whatever is in our hands to make sure that they take the right decision, and so we are doing our maximum, which is to offer [the CRFS] at cost.”

Airbus hopes to have secured European Aviation Safety Agency certification of the CRFS for the AS350 B3 and EC130 B4 by the end of this calendar year, with approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to follow shortly afterwards. Deliveries of the CRFS will begin in the first quarter of 2020.

The manufacturer also announced plans to introduce an energy-absorbing crash resistant four-seat bench for passengers in the rear of the H125.

“This is something that we are doing because we want to, again, promote more safety for our operators, for our people flying the H125,” said Aloccio.

The type’s front seats, and those in the front and rear of the H130, are already crash resistant.

Airbus hopes to certify the bench “as early as possible,” but said that would likely be in 2020. The weight increase of the new bench would be “a few kilos” at most, said Aloccio, but the team’s target is to have no weight penalty at all.

The development of the bench represents something of a victory for Chris Emerson, the president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters’ U.S. subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters, Inc., who told Vertical at last year’s Heli-Expo that he would push the company to develop energy-absorbing seats for rear passengers.

“Anything is possible and I do believe that it is possible to find a better solution on the AStar back seats than we have today,” he said at the time.

Airbus is still to determine whether the bench will be a standard installation or offered as an option, but is leaning towards the former. The ability to retrofit the seat into fielded aircraft is still being explored, due to the need to determine whether structural reinforcements would be required below the seats.

In other moves aimed at improving safety in the H125 and H130, Airbus is developing a rotor strike alerting system and a wire detection system.

The rotor strike alerting system will work similarly to a parking radar on a car, with sensors that alert pilots if they are approaching an obstacle. The wire detection system would work in a similar manner.

A global medical response with a local solution - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTAzLWEtZ2xvYmFsLW1lZGljYWwtcmVzcG9uc2Utd2l0aC1hLWxvY2FsLXNvbHV0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air medical transport relies on helicopters, from the H125 to twin-engine aircraft, to bring critically ill or injured people to intensive-care facilities. Here, we look at how one company in the U.S. fits into the picture.

“It’s often a case where somebody was in an accident, has for instance a cranial bleed, and was taken to the local hospital which doesn’t have the capability to repair the damage,” says Fred Buttrell, CEO of Air Medical Group Holdings, a provider of emergency and non-emergency airlifts to geographically dispersed communities. “We’ll do an air medical transport to a level 1 trauma centre or tertiary care centre.”

“Eighty percent of our transports come from rural or super-rural zip codes,” says Fred Buttrell, adding that the majority of flights involve trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke or acute respiratory failure, where time is of the essence.

As rural hospitals continue to close in the U.S., hundreds of communities are left miles from the nearest critical access hospital. In its June 2018 report to Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported that among hospital closures from 2013 to 2017, 21 of them were more than 20 miles from the next neighboring hospital.

In 2018, two of the U.S.’s largest EMS transport providers - Air Medical Group Holdings and American Medical Response – combined to form Global Medical Response (GMR). The company’s six air-based subsidiaries and dozens of ground ambulances now provide emergency medical transport for 46 states and the District of Columbia.

Delivering local solutions

“For many health systems, transportation and patient throughput is a pain point,” says Fred Buttrell. “We offer the ability to deliver transport at a local level. We are fortunate to be in the situation of being a global medical response organisation with a local solution.”

At Heli-Expo 2019, GMR announced a firm order with Airbus for 21 helicopters. The order will allow the transport provider to expand into new markets, replace its aging aircraft, and bolster services to customers.

Specialty aircraft for special services

Over 400 aircraft – both helicopters and fixed-wing – are at AMGH’s disposal through its six subsidiaries. One such company, Med-Trans, operates the H125, H130, H135, and the H155 from 29 states in the U.S. southeast. “We’ve grown with Airbus over time for either our acquisition or new aircraft needs, and our fleet replacement strategy has allowed us to expand into the H125 and H130 markets,” says Robert Hamilton, President of Med-Trans Corporation.

One of the considerations in acquiring new aircraft is the ability to tailor air medical services to the local population or specialty segments. “The H130’s large cabin and increased payload will allow us to do more pediatric transports,” says Fred Buttrell. “The H135 is our IFR specialty transport capability, mostly in partnership with health systems that want to have that mission profile as part of their continuum of care. And the H125 has been a very good helicopter for us, especially in high-density altitudes in the west [of the U.S.] where we can continue to provide service without compromising on patient weight.”

- Fred Buttrell, CEO of Air Medical Group Holdings

Dedication to the mission

The sheer variety of missions air ambulance organisations take part in is a testament to their service. Since the start of 2019, Med-Trans’ social media page makes mention of the safe transfer of a critical care patient in high winds, the recovery of stroke victims airlifted by the company, and inaugurating one of their aircraft for an NICU* flight.

It also mentions the dedication involved for men and women for whom “EMS is a calling,” as Fred Buttrell puts it. Air ambulance crews and paramedics number among some of the industry’s most experienced; paramedics first must work a certain number of years as EMTs and undergo paramedic training before getting certified to work on an air ambulance crew.

“As a clinician, when I got into the air medical business in the early 90s it was in an Airbus product,” says Robert Hamilton. “I get the opportunity to speak first-hand from a clinical background as to the confidence that an Airbus product has given me personally for many years. The stories that I can think of are just so many.”

Airbus drones deliver first packages to ships offshore - New Atlas,"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1kcm9uZXMtc2t5d2F5cy1jYXJnby1zaGlwcy81ODg5My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its Skyways project, Airbus has kicked off a new drone delivery trial in which its unmanned aircraft of the same name will deposit packages onto ships anchored offshore. Designed to streamline loading operations, it's hoped the technology now being tested in Singapore will not only speed up delivery times, but offer a greener and safer way of doing business in busy ports.

Airbus is conducting the trials with logistics company Wilhelmsen Ships Services and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. The very first flight took place last Friday, with one of the company's Skyways parcel delivery drones loaded up with 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) of 3D-printed objects for its first day on the job.

This meant taking off from the shoreline of Singapore's Marina South Pier and flying autonomously over a distance of 1.5 km (0.93 mi) to a ship anchored off-shore. It then deposited its cargo on deck before completing the return leg, with the entire trip said to take no more than 10 minutes.

""We are thrilled to launch the first trial of its kind in the maritime world,"" said Airbus' Skyways lead, Leo Jeoh. ""Today's accomplishment is a culmination of months of intense preparation by our dedicated team, and the strong collaboration with our partner, as we pursue a new terrain in the maritime industry.""

According to Airbus, the Skyways drone is actually capable of carrying up to 4 kg (8.8 lb) and reaching vessels as far as 3 km (1.86 mi) off shore, traveling through dedicated aerial corridors with autonomous control software.

The remainder of the trials will explore these capabilities, as well as how unmanned aircraft can be put to use in the wider shipping industry to make things run a little smoother. These kinds of supplementary loading procedures could apparently speed up deliveries by up to six times, lower costs by up to 90 percent, help cut down on carbon emissions and also avoid accidents that can occur through typical loading procedures in busy ports.

""Delivery of essential spares, medical supplies and cash to master via launch boat, is an established part of our portfolio of husbandry services, which we provide day in and day out, in ports all over the world,"" says Marius Johansen, Vice President Commercial, Ships Agency at Wilhelmsen Ships Services. ""Modern technology such as the unmanned aircraft systems, are just a new tool, albeit a very cool one, with which we can push our industry ever forward and improve how we serve our customers.""

Airbus will soon build on these initial flights with further testing of its Skyways drone in urban environments, with trials to kick off ""soon"" in partnership with the National University of Singapore.

China Agrees to Buy a Boatload of Airbus Planes - The Motley Fool,"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzAzLzI2L2NoaW5hLWFncmVlcy10by1idXktYS1ib2F0bG9hZC1vZi1haXJidXMtcGxhbmVzLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"But the recently announced deal for 300 aircraft may not be as significant as it seems at first glance.

In early 2018 -- two months after Boeing (BA -1.90%) announced a deal to sell 300 jets to China -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced that China was close to finalizing orders for 184 Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) A320-family planes. He also said that France was hoping to strike additional deals to sell A350 or A380 widebody jets to China.

However, 2018 came and went with no order. But on Monday, in conjunction with a state visit to France by China's President Xi Jinping, China placed an even bigger order for Airbus jets than the one discussed last year.

More orders coming Airbus' way

While there are numerous different state-owned and private airlines in China, the government has ultimate authority over aircraft orders. China periodically places large orders with Boeing and Airbus, and it tends to use these orders as a ""carrot"" in political and economic negotiations with those aircraft manufacturers' home countries.

Under the deal announced this week, China plans to buy 300 Airbus aircraft -- 290 A320-family planes and 10 A350s. Neither party specified which variants of these aircraft families will be acquired. In all likelihood, details like that are still being hammered out: The two sides have only reached a ""general terms agreement"" thus far, not a binding firm order.

The deal with China should help the European aerospace giant get its order backlog moving in the right direction again. In the first two months of 2019, Airbus' backlog shrank, as it booked new orders for just four aircraft, offset by 103 cancellations.

That said, the 300 orders announced this week are not necessarily all new, as Flightglobal noted recently. Airbus has a substantial number of orders from undisclosed customers in its official backlog already, including nearly 600 A320-family orders and two dozen A350-family orders.

Bad news for the 737 MAX? Not necessarily...

China's big Airbus deal comes in the shadow of the worldwide grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets, following two fatal crashes in the span of five months. Aviation regulators in China have been among the most aggressive in addressing this safety crisis. China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX, and it has stopped taking applications for airworthiness certifications of new 737 MAX aircraft. Chinese regulators have also made it clear that they will independently evaluate any design changes proposed by Boeing, rather than just following the FAA's lead.

The combination of the big Airbus order and China's response to the Boeing 737 MAX crashes might make it seem like Boeing is in trouble in the fast-growing Chinese market. But here as elsewhere, any dip in orders for the Boeing 737 MAX is likely to be temporary.

First, China's aviation market is massive and growing rapidly. Airbus expects China to need an additional 7,400 aircraft over the next 20 years, including more than 6,000 single-aisle planes (like the A320neo and 737 MAX families). Boeing's estimates are even more bullish. Airbus alone cannot meet all of that demand. While a homegrown Chinese jet will soon be available as a third option, it will take a while for production to ramp up -- and in any case, it's not as technologically advanced as the 737 MAX and A320neo families.

Second, Boeing opened a 737 MAX completion center in China just a few months ago. This new facility currently installs interiors for the numerous 737s destined for Chinese airlines. In the future, the jets will also be painted there. If China stops ordering 737 MAX aircraft, this work will go away.

Third, as noted above, aircraft orders are often used by China as a bargaining chip. With China eager to roll back U.S. tariffs on various Chinese imports, a long-term move away from Boeing jets -- and the 737 MAX in particular -- would be hard to pull off. Thus, once Boeing demonstrates that it has addressed any safety vulnerabilities for the 737 MAX, it could be in line for another big order from China.

Airbus should be pleased about landing a big order from China. But the deal announced this week doesn't reflect a change in the balance of power in the aircraft manufacturing industry."

The larger-than-expected order, which matches an order for 300 Boeing planes when U.S. Donald Trump visited Beijing in 2017, follows a year-long vacuum of purchases in which China failed to place significant orders amid global trade tensions.

It also comes as the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max has left uncertainty over Boeing's immediate hopes for a major jet order as the result of any warming of U.S.-China trade ties.

There was no evidence of any direct connection between the Airbus deal and Sino-U.S. tensions or Boeing fleet problems, but China watchers say Beijing has a history of sending diplomatic signals or playing off suppliers through state aircraft deals.

""The conclusion of a big (aviation) contract ... is an important step forward and an excellent signal in the current context,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint address with his Chinese counterpart.

The United States and China are edging towards a possible deal to ease a months-long tariff row and a deal involving as many as 200 to 300 Boeing jets had until recently been expected as part of the possible rapprochement."
Astronautics wireless airborne communication system completes initial ground tests on Airbus Helicopters' H145 - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 05 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3ZlcnRpY2FsbWFnLmNvbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9hc3Ryb25hdXRpY3Mtd2lyZWxlc3MtYWlyYm9ybmUtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW0tY29tcGxldGVzLWluaXRpYWwtZ3JvdW5kLXRlc3RzLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1oMTQ1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Astronautics Corporation of America’s wireless airborne communication system (wACS) successfully completed initial ground tests on Airbus Helicopters’ H145 prototype aircraft, an important programmatic milestone.

Astronautics’ wACS is a complete air-to-ground data management platform that simply and securely gets information on and off the aircraft — enabling streamlined operations, improved dispatch rates, improved mission capabilities, and mobile device connectivity. Flight testing will commence later this month with the wACS product being standard fit for most Airbus Helicopters production aircraft within the next 18 to 24 months.

During the tests — completed in December — the system successfully collected and wirelessly transmitted data via cellular and Wi-Fi from the aircraft to the wACS ground system. In addition, the system also enables operators to securely push data to the aircraft (configuration, navigation databases, flight plans, etc.).

“This successful ground test was a great accomplishment for both the Astronautics and Airbus teams,” said Astronautics director of connected aircraft solutions Ed Callahan. “The entire system was tested end-to-end from the airborne hardware to the secure ground system, enabling secure two-way data transmittal. The ability to securely push data to the aircraft is a real game changer. We are looking forward to supporting Airbus Helicopters’ flight operations and maintenance services with this state-of-the-art secure connectivity solution that provides value to Airbus Helicopters operators in the form of enhanced capabilities with lower operating costs.”

Astronautics’ wACS will provide Airbus Helicopters and its operators the ability to:

Aggregate and securely transfer operational and maintenance data to onboard repository, Wi-Fi connected tablets, and the wACS ground system over Wi-Fi or cellular connection, with cybersecurity ensured via encryption with two independent layers of security;

Securely connect pilot/crew tablets with on-board avionics while in flight;

Securely push data and updates from the ground to the aircraft wirelessly;

Store and retrieve hundreds of hours of operational data within the system; and

Interface with SATCOM for real-time inflight deck connectivity.

Astronautics’ HAI Heli-Expo 2019 stand will feature a wACS demonstration highlighting the system’s ability to securely and rapidly upload and download data.

These New Airplane Seats Could Make Economy Feel Like First Class (Video) - Travel + Leisure,"Sun, 03 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy1sYXllci1odWJlcnQtZWNvbm9teS1zZWF0LWRlc2lnbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For too long, economy seats have been built with a one-size-fits-all mindset, resulting in a one-size-fits-few reality. Innovation in economy seating has been scarce, and adjustable seating a nearly impossible dream.

But a new seat design, developed through an Airbus Innovation Lab collaboration with strategic design agency LAYER, may have cracked the code on the economy seat of the future.

LAYER's Founder and Creative Director Benjamin Hubert designed the seating concept — called ""Move"" — around smart elements that help the seat adapt to the size and needs of each individual passenger. Smart textiles, which link to a handy mobile app, let passengers monitor and control comfort factors including seat tension and temperature from their phone.

""At LAYER, we believe good design should be accessible to all,"" Hubert said. ""All too often, new concepts for flying are focused on innovation in business class. We were excited to take on this project with Airbus to find ways to improve and add value to the economy class experience – for both the passenger and the airline.""

The lightweight structure of the ""Move"" seat is similar to modern ergonomic chairs, with a perforated composite frame that is fitted with a knitted, one-piece sling seat.

The cover that makes up the sling seat is made with a polyester wood-blend textile that has conductive yarn in the weave. This yarn connects to sensors that measure passenger biometrics like temperature, seat tension, pressure and passenger movement. Passengers can use their Move app to switch seat settings from massage to meal time to sleep. The app can also remind passengers when they need to move to avoid discomfort, and will even suggest in-flight exercises.

Embedded sensors also help the smart seat adapt automatically to the passenger's weight, size and type of movement to reduce pressure points. The knit of the seat cover is thicker where cushioning is needed, and the conductive threads contract the fabric to fit the seat around the body.

Crucially, the concept seat does not recline, negating the heated debate over whether reclining on a plane is okay. ""Move"" has a fixed back, but adjustable elements leave room for passengers to stretch.

Other smart features include adjustable tray tables, options for in-flight entertainment and power outlets, and detachable armrests that let couples and groups sit together more comfortably.

The tray table is stowed vertically on this seat and can be folded to half-size for beverages or to hold tablets while passengers watch their own entertainment. They can be unfolded to full-size when passengers want to eat or get some work done. Of course, there are already folding tray tables on several airplanes — but the neat trick in this particular design is that the height of the tray table is adjustable. This makes the seat far more comfortable to use for different in-flight activities, leaving more knee room for taller passengers and providing easier access for shorter passengers.

The curved headrest creates a place to rest your head when you sleep, without slumping onto the shoulders of your fellow passengers.

A central island on the seat-back that holds the adjustable tray table also includes a small pocket for storage of personal items. There is a special stowing area on the side of the seat designed to hold passengers' laptops securely.

Passengers won't be losing their stowed devices, either. The smart seat's pressure-sensitive yarns can notify passengers after landing if they've left something behind.

The concept took 18 months to develop and is intended for short to mid-haul flights. But don't get too excited just yet — ""Move"" still has to go through the long process of prototype development to certification and manufacturing—and it would need an airline to bring it onboard. But considering its eco-friendly features —less weight, less dependence on foams, and covers that are easy to remove and keep clean— airlines might just invest."

Rega becomes launch customer for Airbus H145 retrofit - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3JlZ2EtYmVjb21lcy1sYXVuY2gtY3VzdG9tZXItZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1LXJldHJvZml0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Swiss Air-Rescue Rega has taken the decision to retrofit its entire H145 fleet of seven helicopters to the new 5-bladed version, making them the launch customer for the retrofit of the new H145.

“We’re proud to be amongst the first customers to upgrade our H145 to the new version,” said Heinz Leibundgut, chief pilot and member of Rega’s management board. “Our patients will profit from the increased useful load. It is a great benefit for our air rescue operation, where every additional kilogram is crucial, especially in challenging environments like the Alps.”

“Airbus Helicopters is pleased that Rega has taken the decision to upgrade its entire H145 fleet to the new version,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “We thank Rega for their continued trust in our H145 family of helicopters.”

Rega is currently replacing its EC145 fleet with H145 helicopters. Six out of seven H145s have already been delivered, with the last one to follow in May this year. The helicopters of the H145 family are in service with the Rega for more than 15 years.

The new upgrade of the H145 — revealed at Heli-Expo — embodies Airbus’ approach to value creation through innovation. It boasts several new features that will allow customers to enhance operations: The innovative five-blade bearingless rotor increases the useful load by 150 kilogram, further enhancing the mission capabilities of the aircraft. This new rotor also improves crew and passenger comfort. Other advantages include a smaller D-value, allowing the H145 to operate in more confined areas, simplified maintenance, and an increased availability rate."
