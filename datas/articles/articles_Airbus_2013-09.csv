Airbus: China will trump US with flight demand - CNBC,"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTMvMDkvMjQvYWlyYnVzLWluZHVzdHJ5LW5lZWRzLTQ0LXRyaWxsaW9uLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMtYnktMjAzMi5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTMvMDkvMjQvYWlyYnVzLWluZHVzdHJ5LW5lZWRzLTQ0LXRyaWxsaW9uLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMtYnktMjAzMi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The amount of passengers taking domestic flights in China in twenty years' time will dwarf that in the United States, leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday.

""It's a big story,"" John Leahy, chief operating officer at the customers department for Airbus told CNBC. Twenty nine percent of all the revenue passenger kilometers are going to be coming out of Asia-Pacific, he added, with China growing rapidly.

""In twenty years the number one domestic market by far will be domestic China, it's quite a shift,"" he said.

At a press event in London, the firm outlined its global market forecast covering the period of 2013-2032. It predicts that jet demand will grow by 3.6 percent to 29,266 aircraft over this 20-year period. It added that the industry will need $4.4 trillion worth of new jetliners and freighters in over 20 years, revising its growth outlook higher for the sector.

Atlanta airport celebrates its first Airbus A380 route - USA TODAY,"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDkvMDYvYXRsYW50YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWl0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1yb3V0ZS1vbi1rb3JlYW4tYWlyLzI3Nzc4NDMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta airport celebrates its first Airbus A380 route

The world's busiest airport now has regular service on the world's biggest commercial passenger plane.

That's after Korean Air inaugurated A380 service this week between Atlanta and Seoul on its Airbus A380 superjumbo jets.

The airline's first A380 flight to Atlanta arrived this past Sunday. But airport and airline officials saved the official welcoming fanfare for Friday morning, when Korean's A380 received a water-cannon salute (see photo) and ribbon-cutting ceremony upon arriving in Atlanta. A Korean Air spokeswoman tells Today in the Sky that airport and airlines officials opted to stage the celebration Friday, instead of during the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Korean Air has been flying to Atlanta since December 1994, but has decided to upgauge its flights on the route to its bigger A380s.

""The arrival of the Airbus A380 underscores the prominence of Atlanta as a gateway city and a competitor in global markets,"" Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed says in a release. ""We're pleased that Korean Air has chosen to introduce travelers to its A380 service to Seoul.""

To accommodate the plane's size, the Atlanta airport had to widen two runways and three taxiways by a total of more than 855,000 square feet. The airport also had to install new passenger loading bridges that could accommodate the double-decker plane.

""We've spent several months making a number of enhancements to airport facilities in preparation for the arrival of the world's largest aircraft,"" Louis Miller, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport's general manager, says in the statement. ""We see these improvements as part of the growth process inherent in being the world's busiest airport.""

With its arrival, Atlanta notes it becomes only the fourth U.S. city to offer A380 service to Asia. A number of other U.S. airports, however, host at least seasonal A380 service on trans-Atlantic routes. Among those are New York JFK, Washington Dulles and Miami.

Korean Air initially will fly the A380 three times a week between Atlanta and Seoul, with a brief cessation of A380 service during the second half of September. The A380 flights will resume in early October and will become daily on Oct. 27, a Korean Air spokeswoman tells Today in the Sky.

""Our A380 flight is a game changer for the region,"" John Jackson, Korean Air's VP of marketing for the Americas, says in a statement. ""We now offer service to Asia from Atlanta that no one else can meet. Our aircraft is roomier, quieter and more comfortable than any other serving the Southeast. Our traffic between Atlanta and Seoul has been growing at 10% per year and it makes good sense to invest in markets that are showing long-term growth.""

Korean Air boasts that its superjumbo A380s offer the most spacious seating of any carrier flying the jet. With just 407 seats on its A380s, Korean Air says that ""provides more space per passenger,"" especially as ""compared to more than 450 seats on other carriers' (A380) planes.""

Korean Air's A380s feature 12 Kosmo First Class suites, 94 lie-flat sleeper seats and 301 coach seats."
Airbus Prepares to Ramp Up Flight Testing of Next-Gen Passenger Jet - WIRED,"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA5L2FpcmJ1cy1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdGluZy1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over the course of just a few years, the global airline fleet will grow from no composite airliners, to three models: the Boeing 787, Airbus A350 and Bombardier CSeries. Airbus' wide-body jet made its first flight back in June, and the A350 XWB flight test program has been relatively trouble-free so far. A second flight test airplane is expected to make its first flight soon at Airbus' test center in France, and the composite airplane remains on schedule to enter airline service during the second half of next year.

The A350 XWB is slightly bigger than Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and so far has enjoyed a smooth flight test program. The second airplane will begin flight testing in both cold and hot weather conditions. The cold-weather testing is normally used to simply find any issues that may arise when systems, parts, and materials get, well ... extremely cold. On the other hand, hot-weather testing does look at some of the straightforward issues related to something getting too hot, but it is also critical in determining aircraft performance limitations.

The lower density of hotter air reduces an airplane's performance. The engines don't produce as much power and the wings do not generate as much lift. Airplane makers must define these limitations during the flight testing so that when an airplane is operated in and out of an airport with high temperatures (and/or high humidity/high altitude), the pilots make the necessary adjustments to their performance calculations.

A third A350 flight test airplane is in the final stages of assembly and will include a full cabin interior. The first two aircraft are filled with flight engineer test stations, water ballast tanks to transfer the weight around the cabin during testing (a quick glimpse can be seen in the video below from Airbus), and other instrumentation unique to flight test. Equipped with a full interior, the third airplane will be used to test a the airplane and the cabin as if it were an airliner in service.

In all there will be five flight test aircraft in the A350 XWB program and Airbus expects to fly about 2,500 hours before receiving certification of the design next year. Qatar Airways is expected to take delivery of the first airplane sometime in the second half of 2014. That airplane will start its way down the assembly line by the end of this year.

CNN —

Two heavyweights dominate the high-capacity commercial aviation industry – Boeing and Airbus.

Now the world’s third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft is touting an apparently lighter and quieter plane that it hopes will cut into the giants’ market share for narrow body, medium-range commercial jets.

The virgin test flight of the Bombardier CS100 – from the first new family of commercial passenger jets in decades – took place at Mirabel Airport, in Quebec, Monday.

The 110-seat, single-aisle aircraft (a 135-seat version in the CSeries is also in the works, and a maximum capacity of 149 has been reported) is in the same class as Boeing’s 737 series and Airbus 318 and 319 aircraft.

Bombardier is a Canadian multinational company headquartered in Montreal.

Apart from a minor alert going off midair, the two-and-a-half-hour flight was a success, the Age reports.

“The performance of the CSeries aircraft was very impressive,” said the new jet’s test pilot, Chuck Ellis.

“We couldn’t have wished for a better maiden flight.”

Quiet, lightweight

Expected to enter service in 2015, the Bombardier plane has two advantages over its rivals, its makers says.

Made of lightweight composite materials, the CS100 beats Airbus and Boeing for fuel performance, most industry experts reportedly agree.

Bombardier says its CSeries planes will also be quieter than any existing commercial jet.

That’s probably not because the company has heard the cries of long-suffering residents near heavily trafficked airports around the world, but because regulation increasingly demands controls on airplane noise.

Orders in

The CS100 has already won orders from carriers such as Latvia’s AirBaltic, which is buying 10 of the planes.

“You could hardly hear the takeoff,” Martin Gauss, CEO of AirBaltic, said after watching the test flight in Quebec.

“This was one of the reasons we bought it, along with the cost savings from lower fuel burn.”

There’s a good reason why new commercial jet series come along so rarely – the astronomical cost involved in developing them.

The CS100 had already cost $500 million more than its official estimate of $3.5 billion, Bombardier said."
"Airbus pilots fell asleep at same time, says incident report - The Guardian","Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEzL3NlcC8yNi9haXJidXMtcGlsb3RzLWFzbGVlcC1hdXRvcGlsb3QtY2Fh0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTMvc2VwLzI2L2FpcmJ1cy1waWxvdHMtYXNsZWVwLWF1dG9waWxvdC1jYWE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both pilots on a Airbus passenger plane were asleep at the same time with the UK-operated aircraft flying on autopilot, in an incident reported last month.

One of the pilots indicated in a report to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that the pair nodded off after both had only five hours' sleep in the previous two nights.

Details of the incident, which happened on 13 August, have emerged at a time when the UK pilots' organisation, Balpa, is unhappy at proposed European changes to flight-time regulations.

A CAA spokesman said: ""This was a serious incident but an isolated one. I think lessons will be learned from this. We are circulating this report within the industry.

""We don't know why the pilots had had so little sleep before this flight. They were taking it in turn to have rest periods, with the one always checking the autopilot and it looks as if both fell asleep at the same time.""

Details of the incident, logged by the CAA as a mandatory occurrence report, were obtained by a news agency that had asked about incidents relating to pilot fatigue.

The CAA did not say which airline was involved nor where the aircraft, an Airbus A330, was travelling.

The report, which was headed ""Flight crew suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue,"" said: ""Reporter (almost certainly the captain) suggests both members of flight crew had only five hours' sleep in two nights due to longer duty periods with insufficient opportunity to sleep. Both crew rested for 20-minute rotations and fell asleep.""

Balpa said: ""In the UK we have a strict set of flight safety rules which govern how long and how often a pilot can fly before their performance is impaired.

""The EU is proposing more permissive flight safety rules which would allow pilots to be flying aircraft whilst dangerously fatigued. These rules were not developed using scientific data and could have a grave impact on the safety of UK aviation.""

Balpa said the EU proposals were flawed in many areas, with pilots being legally allowed to land an aircraft having been awake for 22 hours, pilots operating longer-haul flights (such as west coast US) with only two crew rather than three at present, and pilots possibly being forced to work up to seven early starts in a row.

The CAA said on Thursday: ""We understand that Balpa are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now.""

Balpa said last month's incident ""comes as no surprise"", adding that it had repeatedly warned the CAA of the risk of both pilots falling asleep, including in a letter to each member of the CAA board last year.

The Balpa general secretary, Jim McAuslan, said: ""British pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face. As the regulator responsible for UK flight safety, the CAA has been far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the under-reported problem.

""In fact, the CAA and government are backing EU cuts to UK flight safety that will increase tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents."""

North America & Frontier Says Goodbye to the Babybus – Airbus A318 - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wOS9ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLXNheXMtZ29vZGJ5ZS10by10aGUtYmFieWJ1cy1haXJidXMtYTMxOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The last Airbus A318 operated by a North American airline has exited service. The A318, sometimes affectionately referred to as the “Babybus,” is the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family. Weighing nearly the same as its larger brother, the A319, and operating with the same crew requirements, the economics of operating the A318 in North America just didn’t make sense. The similarly-sized Boeing 737-600 has largely suffered the same fate (although WestJet still operates a fleet in Canada).

Frontier Airlines (F9) was the launch customer for the A318, receiving their first bird in July of 2003. They took delivery of 11 copies from 2003 – 2007, but recently they retired their last A318. When asked about the retiring of the young aircraft, a Frontier spokesperson told AirlineReporter.com that, “over the past few years, Frontier€s fleet strategy has focused on increasing the average size of our aircraft, while decreasing the per seat operating cost, in order to provide the lowest fares to our customers. With fewer seats, the cost of operation per seat on the A318 was higher compared with the A319 or A320.”

A318s only remain in service with a small number of carriers, with the bulk flown by Air France and Avianca, and just a few still by LAN and Tarom. A LAN representative told AirlineReporter.com that they are still operating three A318’s (through subsidiaries) but plan to retire those birds by the end of the year. British Airways (BA) also operates a token fleet, using an all-business layout for the London City – JFK route (and utilizing the old Concorde flight numbers).

The fleet choice is not accidental; one of the selling points of the A318 was its ability to utilize small airports. According to an Airbus representative, “the A318 is unique in its own right as it is the largest commercial aircraft certified to land at steeper-than-usual gradients, making it ideal for constrained locations and downtown airports €“ and that means major cost and time savings for business travelers.”

Most of the retired A318s have actually been scrapped; the engines and major components are more valuable parted out than the plane as a whole.

An interesting factoid – the A318 has a taller tail than its siblings, much like the 737-600 and the 747 SP. Those fat, short jets just need the extra stability. Plus, it gave Frontier a bigger palette for their adorable animal branding (unfortunately, when their old A318s was ferried to Europe to be broken up, the tail got “blanked” first).

We asked AirlineReporter.com readers on our Facebook page how they felt about the A318 leaving North America. While many had flown the F9 birds, most folks were less-than-nostalgic about the Babybus. The best comment goes to reader Lyle Perry, who said the A318, “looks like it got shrunk in the dryer.”

Being Denver-based, I actually flew on a number of F9’s A318s. The were sort of a novelty, but far better than flying on a regional jet. Very easy to load and unload, that’s for sure! I would love to get on one of those BA flights across the pond, though.

In its international market forecast released Tuesday, Airbus said air traffic will grow by 4.7% each year up until 2032. To cope with increased demand, nearly 30,000 new passenger and freight aircraft valued at $4.4 trillion will need to be added to current stocks.

Planes will also get bigger. The average aircraft size will increase by one quarter as airlines opt for larger planes.

A swelling middle class and more affordable air travel are among the factors fueling the rise in traffic, with most of the growth coming out of Asia.

The Asia-Pacific region will overtake Europe and America to lead the world in air traffic by 2032.

Airbus, owned by European aerospace group EADS (EADSF), forecasts more than one third of all new passenger aircraft will be delivered to customers in the Asia-Pacific region.

Rival Boeing (BA) is also reacting to strong demand from Asia. Last month the company, which this year overtook Airbus to become the world's largest aircraft maker, said it plans to triple the size of its China fleet over the next 20 years.

Japan's ANA to consider delay risk when choosing Boeing or Airbus - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qYXBhbnMtYW5hLWNvbnNpZGVyLWRlbGF5LXJpc2stMTcwNjI1MTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All Nippon Airways' (ANA) planes are seen at Haneda airport in Tokyo January 29, 2013.

By Tim Kelly and Kentaro Sugiyama

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese carrier ANA Holdings , will consider the risk of delivery delays when choosing between Airbus's (EAD.PA) A350 and Boeing Co's (BA) yet to be launched 777X for an order of as many as 30 wide-body jets, it said on Thursday.

U.S. planemaker Boeing has a more than 80 percent market share in Japan and has dominated for decades helped by strong ties to suppliers there.

But delays to deliveries of its 787 jet, which is a third built in Japan, and its subsequent grounding because of overheating batteries may have given European rival Airbus a rare opening, analysts have said.

""In the past, aircraft development used to be more on schedule, but lately there have been delays,"" ANA's president, Shinichiro Ito, said in an interview.

""Possible delays is something we will consider,"" he added, saying ANA would decide between the Boeing and Airbus aircraft by around April and that it would also look at other factors such as price and which aircraft makes most economic sense.

The order will replace ANA's aging long-haul Boeing 777 fleet, which it plans to retire from 2020. Local rival Japan Airlines too is looking to phase out its older 777 at the same time, representing a combined order from the Japanese carriers of around 50 jets worth billions of dollars.

Industry analysts believe Airbus may have a better chance with ANA than JAL. Unlike JAL, ANA has bought from Airbus before and, with the world's biggest fleet of 787s, ANA has been hurt more by glitches that have troubled Boeing's carbon fiber jet.

Concerned its European rival is gaining ground, Boeing has countered with a sales offensive aimed at closing Airbus's window of opportunity, sources told Reuters this month.

Choosing Boeing's 777X, a proposed upgraded version of the 777, could mean ANA and JAL having to be launch customers again for a jet that the U.S. planemaker has promised for 2019, but has yet to officially green-light.

Story continues

Airbus is offering the first variant of its new A350, the -900, which is being flight tested and is scheduled for first deliveries from 2016, to replace the Boeing 777-200s. It is also pushing the upcoming larger -1000 to replace the 777-300 family.

Boeing is offering the largest variant of the 787, the -10, as well as the 777X, that it says will have lower operating costs and longer range.

Boeing and Airbus have declined to comment on the negotiations.

Early in the morning Airbus Tweeted, “We are aware of an A330 incident with @ThaiAirways in Bangkok and stand ready to fully support investigations.” Thai Airways President, Sorajak Kasemsuvan, said the following in a statement:

“After touchdown at Suvarnabhumi Airport, the landing gear malfunctioned and caused the aircraft to skid off the runway. Sparks were noticed from the vicinity of the right landing gear near the engine; the matter is under investigation.”

"Both pilots fall asleep during British Airbus flight, incident report reveals - CBS News","Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYm90aC1waWxvdHMtZmFsbC1hc2xlZXAtZHVyaW5nLWJyaXRpc2gtYWlyYnVzLWZsaWdodC1pbmNpZGVudC1yZXBvcnQtcmV2ZWFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two pilots of a British passenger plane both fell asleep while the aircraft was on autopilot, according an August incident report unveiled by U.K. media Thursday.

The two pilots of the British-operated Airbus A330 initially took turns napping, but then both fell asleep, according to an report documented by a British airline regulatory body and initially provided to The Sun, a British tabloid.

The report states that the crew member reporting the Aug. 13 incident suggested that the fatigue experienced by the pilot was due to a lack of sleep -- 5 hours each in two nights -- caused by long hours and ""insufficient opportunity to sleep.""

The report was filed with the U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority and then obtained through a Freedom of Information request by The Sun, which on Thursday ran the front-page headline: ""This is Your Captains Sleeping.""

According to The Sun, one of the pilots ""eventually woke and roused the other -- but neither knew how long they had dozed.""

In a statement, a CAA spokesman said: ""Safety is the CAA's number one priority. We take fatigue related incidents extremely seriously and will address detailed questions to individual airlines when problems emerge. The UK has an excellent safety record, but we are constantly striving to improve air safety and strongly encourage anyone in the aviation industry, especially pilots, to use our completely confidential reporting procedure to tell us of any concerns they may have.""

A U.K. pilots union seized on the report, saying the incident was ""no surprise"" given working conditions for pilots.

""British pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face,"" Jim McAuslan, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said in a statement.

""As the regulator responsible for UK flight safety the CAA has been far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem.""

The group also used the incident to push back on proposed European Union changes to flight safety rules, including pilot hours.

The CAA did not reveal the specific airline involved or the destination of the flight."

Carried out using second production aircraft, also designated as MSN2, the trials confirmed that the aircraft can perform well on gravel runways, with minimal damage to the exterior from stones and dust.

The aircraft successfully conducted 25 landings during six flights on the same runway with and without the optional nosewheel deflector demonstrating its ability to operate to and from rough strips close to the scene of military or humanitarian action.

Demonstrations included ground manoeuvring, rejected takeoffs, and the use of propeller reverse thrust at speeds as low as 70kt without causing any engine or cockpit contamination.

A400M Flight Tests head Eric Isorce said, ”We are extremely pleased with the results of these tests which were very close to all predictions and confirm the A400M´s capability to operate successfully from gravel runways.”

The runway also remained usable after repeated operations.

The First French A400M and the Global Supply Chain: South Africa Flies with the French Air Force - Second Line of ... - Second Line of Defense,"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxMy8wOS90aGUtZmlyc3QtZnJlbmNoLWE0MDBtLWFuZC10aGUtZ2xvYmFsLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtZmxpZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtZnJlbmNoLWFpci1mb3JjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2013-09-30 A key characteristic of core 21st century multi-mission systems is often their multi-national manufacturing character.

This is centrally true for the new A400M, which has just been delivered to the French Air Force.

According to a September 30, 2013 Airbus Military Press release:

More than 700 people celebrated the delivery of the first production A400M new generation airlifter to the French Air Force at a ceremony at the Airbus Military Final Assembly Line (FAL) at Seville, Spain on 30 September. HRH Prince of Asturias, French Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian, Spanish Minister of Defence, Pedro Morenés, as well as other military authorities from France and other partner nations and OCCAR representatives attended the ceremony along with EADS CEO Tom Enders, Airbus Military CEO Domingo Ureña-Raso and more than 300 Airbus and Airbus Military staff. The aircraft, the first of 50 ordered by France and of a total of 174 on order, will be based at Orleans – Bricy Air Base and initially used for training before being deployed on military and humanitarian missions.

But not seen in the picture are the South Africans whose technology is resident on the plane.

Our partner DefenceWeb provided a good set of insights with regard to South African participation in this global plane:

Today was definitely not just another Monday at Denel Aerostructures (DAe), with engineers, artisans and technicians taking some time off to watch a live video link-up of the handover of the first production A400M to the French Air Force (Armee De L’Air) at Airbus Military’s facility in Seville, Spain. The Kempton Park-based member of the Denel Group is the only Tier One supplier of manufactured components to Airbus Military for the new generation airlifter outside of Europe. It is executing three work packages. The latest package is for the manufacture of the ribs, spars and swords, comprising the internal structure of the A400M’s distinctive T-tail and is worth about R200 million. It was concluded in June this year during the Paris Airshow and will run for the duration of the entire A400M build program, Denel chairman Zoli Kunene said.

Pilot: That loud noise doesn't mean your plane's crashing - New York Post,"Tue, 03 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDEzLzA5LzAzL3BpbG90LXRoYXQtbG91ZC1ub2lzZS1kb2VzbnQtbWVhbi15b3VyLXBsYW5lcy1jcmFzaGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have you ever been spooked by a strange noise on a plane?

Patrick Smith, airline pilot and author of the book Cockpit Confidential and the website askthepilot.com explains what you may have been hearing.

“It’s common to hear a loud, repetitive whirring sound emanating from the floorboards of Airbus planes. Sometimes it’s a high-pitched whine; other times it’s a stilted WOOF, WOOF, WOOF, like the noise a very agitated dog might make.

This pertains to twin-engine Airbus models: the A320 series (includes the subvariants A319 and A321) and the larger A330. In the United States, the largest operators of these types are Delta, United, JetBlue, and US Airways. In Australia, Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Australia and Tiger Airways all operate A320 planes.

Almost every frequent flyer has encountered this sound at one time or another. Crews rarely make an effort to explain it, leaving passengers befuddled and sometimes worried. Because the noise is akin to a motor repeatedly trying – and failing – to start, there’s often the assumption that something is malfunctioning.

But never fear, what you hear is actually a device called the power transfer unit, or PTU, which is designed to ensure adequate hydraulic pressures during single-engine operations. To conserve fuel, it’s fairly routine for two-engine planes to taxi with an engine shut down.

Each engine normally pressurizes its own hydraulic system, but with a motor not running, that leaves one system without a power source. That’s where the PTU comes in, helping left power the right, or right power to the left.

Since it’s activated only when the pressure falls below a certain level, the PTU cycles on and off, on and off, on and off. Due to pressure fluctuations, the noise will sometimes continue even after both engines are up and running.

It also does a self-test when the starboard engine is started, so you’ll hear it then as well. Some Boeing aircraft also employ a PTU, but the operation is slightly different and it doesn’t bark like a dog.

Another noise peculiar to Airbus models is a shrill, prolonged whine heard at the gate prior to departure and again after landing. This is an electric hydraulic pump used to open and close the cargo doors.

World’s busiest airport welcomes biggest airliner - CNN,"Fri, 06 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvc3VwZXJqdW1iby1hdGxhbnRhLWFpcnBvcnQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Atlanta's becomes 7th U.S. airport where the giant A380 airliner can land The A380 seats up to 853 passengers compared with Boeing 747-8's 400 to 500 The Superjumbo has 50% more floor space than any other airliner Are bigger airliners better? Passengers, airline experts weigh in

Atlanta, Georgia CNN —

Superjumbo, the world’s largest passenger plane, has finally conquered the world’s busiest airport.

Korean Air kicked off its double-decker Airbus A380 service this week from Seoul to Atlanta, which celebrated Friday with a spectacular ceremony.

Shortly after touching down, Flight 035 slowly taxied to its specially modified gate under a towering arch of water cannons. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport, which handled some 95 million passengers last year, is now the seventh U.S. airfield able to handle this ginormous aircraft.

But nearly six years after the Superjumbo entered service, it’s unclear whether bigger is necessarily better.

Atlanta’s airport spent about $30 million in passenger fees for runway, taxiway and jetway modifications, which enabled Bumshick Ehm – one of Flight 035’s approximately 350 passengers – to easily exit the aircraft after a 13-hour, 7,100-mile nonstop journey.

Ehm was returning home to Atlanta with his 3-year-old daughter after visiting family in Seoul. “Inside, when you’re flying, it really doesn’t feel that different from any other plane,” said Ehm, 33. “But when you see it from the outside, you’re reminded how huge it is.”

More floor space and quieter engines

Air travel is projected to explode in the coming decades. Airlines are looking to freshen their fleets, while aircraft makers are pitching their new planes as the wave of the future. The A380 boasts quieter engines and lightweight construction to save fuel. And it’s roomy – with 50% more floor space than its competitor, the relatively new Boeing 747-8, which seats 400 to 500 passengers.

#ATL24: Behind the scenes at the world’s busiest airport

More than four decades after the original 747 Jumbo Jet, it’s hard for any giant airliner to avoid comparisons to the enormously successful icon.

Korean Air has taken some of the Superjumbo’s floor space and created a “Celestial Bar” lounge hosted by a bartender. Also aboard is a “duty-free showcase” where passengers can shop for cosmetics, perfumes, liquor and accessories. Upstairs, they can find luxurious Kosmo First Class suites and lie-flat sleepers spaced 6 feet apart.

First class takes up the forward part of the lower floor with economy filling up the rear. Upstairs, it’s all business class, offering comfy seating but less privacy. “The cabin is really modern,” Ehm said. “I liked the duty-free shop, and the lounge made me feel like a VIP.”

“The reality is that if you’re on the upper deck, you don’t know there’s another deck below you,” says Brett Snyder of Crankyflier.com. “And if you’re on the lower deck, it’s like sitting on a 747.”

In 2007, at the A380’s American coming out party at New York’s JFK airport, the plane was compared to a cruise liner in the sky.

But the A380’s reputation hit a rough spot in 2011 when a taxiing Air France Superjumbo clipped a smaller plane at JFK so hard it turned it 45 degrees.

Clearly Boeing didn’t think bigger is always better. In the 1990s Boeing briefly partnered with Airbus to collaborate on a new wide-body four-engine airliner before backing out.

Instead, Boeing chose to build on its previous success. The newest version of the 747 – the 747-8 entered service in 2011 with room for 51 extra passengers than its previous version – falls short of A380’s capacity, although it is longer.

Boeing’s new 747 warmed the hearts of countless aviation geeks who still crush on the plane’s distinctive front bulge. And it’s not just geeks who like it. A recent poll of 1,000 fliers by airfarewatchdog.com showed Boeing’s 777 and 747 beating out the A380.

Both Boeing and Airbus have suffered through mechanical problems with new aircraft – the A380 with wing cracks and the 787 Dreamliner with overheating batteries.

Seven U.S. airports can land the A380

Nonetheless, after two years in business, Boeing’s 747-8 has received more than 100 orders. Snyder points out that Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which seats up to 300 and has been in service for two years, has surpassed 900 orders. Compare that to the A380, which has been in service six years and has yet to crack 300.

So now Atlanta joins six other American cities where travelers can fly the A380: Miami, Houston, New York’s JFK, Washington’s Dulles, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Is the A380 opening new routes? Not really, says Snyder, although the Superjumbo has “enabled airlines like Emirates to put more seats on existing routes at a lower cost.”

The 787, however, is opening new routes that traditionally haven’t worked because of cost issues or range limits, he says, including United’s from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. Or British Airways’ from Austin, Texas, to London.

In the end, which will dominate long-distance flight? Will we regularly soar above the clouds in four-engined, double-decker hotels? Or will travelers prefer single-floor planes with two engines and fewer perks?

For Ehm and his daughter as they come to the end of their trans-Pacific journey, that’s not really at the top of their agenda. They’re just glad to be home."
Images: Lufthansa Splits Large Longhaul Order Between 777-9X & A350 - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wOS9pbWFnZXMtbHVmdGhhbnNhLXNwbGl0cy1sYXJnZS1sb25naGF1bC1vcmRlci1iZXR3ZWVuLTc3Ny05eC1hbmQtYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, Lufthansa Airlines announced a major long-haul order split between the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 777-9X. The airline stated it would be adding at least 24 777-9X and 25 of the Airbus A350-900 to their fleet starting as early as 2016. The order is worth about $19 billion USD at list prices, although it is very likely that the airline received a substantial discount from both manufacturers.

Of course, the most interesting part of this order is the fact that Boeing has not officially launched the 777-9X.

Lufthansa plans to use the new, more efficient aircraft to replace older Airbus A340-300s and Boeing 747-400s, which will be phased out by 2025.

“Both aircraft types have a much wider cabin again than the Airbus A340, which will give us new opportunities to improve comfort for our customers when designing the cabin interior”, explained Carsten Spohr, Member of the Executive Board of the Lufthansa Group. He continues, stating that their purchase of larger aircraft, like the A380 and 747-8I, “shows that investing in new types of aircraft pays off.”

The Lufthansa A350 will make use of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB 84 engine, while the 777-9X will have the General Electric GE-9X.

Boeing stated in a press release that the launch of the 777X family, “is targeted for later this year and entry into service around the end of the decade.” At this time, they expect that the 777-9X will have, “around 400 seats,” and will be the “most efficient twin-engine commercial jet in the world with the lowest operating cost per seat of any commercial airplane.” Boeing is planning that the 777X family will provide 20% less fuel consumption and 15% lower operating costs from the current 777.

Even though Boeing has not yet officially launched the new aircraft, they explained to AirlineReporter.com that they, “Welcome Lufthansa’s intention to purchase the aircraft and will work with them,” as Boeing figures out the details before the official launch.

This is not the first time that an airline has announced the purchase of a new aircraft type before it is announced. Recently, Singapore Airlines announced the intention to purchase the 787-10 Dreamliner before Boeing officially launched the aircraft.

“Boeing and Lufthansa share more than 50 years of partnership and innovation and a tradition of launching new airplane models ’“ starting with the original 737s and most recently, the efficient 747-8 Intercontinental,” said Nico Buchholz, Executive Vice President and Head of Fleet, Lufthansa. “Lufthansa is demonstrating its legacy of innovation and market leadership again with its selection of the 777X. We look forward to many years of partnership with Boeing, as we make air travel more efficient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable with airplanes such as the 777X.”

It is hoped that after the completion of this order, the airline will be able to reduce the number of aircraft types that they operate. With their newest announcement, the Lufthansa Group now has 295 brand new aircraft on order that they expect to have delivered by 2025. The total value, at list prices, is almost $50 billion USD.

while maintaining capacity discipline

ATLANTA, Sept. 5, 2013 - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) today announced plans to purchase 40 Airbus aircraft for delivery between 2015 and 2017. The order, which comprises 10 international widebody A330-300 and 30 large domestic narrowbody A321 jets, is the latest step in Delta's prudent fleet renewal to enhance profitability while diligently managing capacity.

'This Airbus agreement is another opportunistic fleet transaction for Delta in which we acquire economically efficient, proven-technology aircraft,' said Richard Anderson, Delta's chief executive officer. 'These A330s and A321s will provide tremendous flexibility for Delta to optimally manage our capacity over the next five years while further improving the flight experience for our customers and returns for our shareholders.

'Disciplined capital deployment is a cornerstone of Delta's comprehensive financial plan,' said Paul Jacobson, Delta's chief financial officer. 'These Airbus aircraft will generate free cash flow and improve our return on invested capital from the time they enter service.'

Airbus A330-300

The 10 A330-300 aircraft will augment Delta's existing fleet of 32 A330s. The first A330 delivery is scheduled for spring of 2015, with three additional airplanes scheduled for that year, four in 2016, and the final two in 2017.

Delta will be the first airline to operate the enhanced 242-metric ton A330-300, which offers additional payload capacity and range. Delta will use the aircraft's versatility to optimize its Pacific and Atlantic networks.

These aircraft will be powered by General Electric CF6-80E1 engines. Delta currently operates similar GE CF6 engines on more than 60 widebody aircraft.

The A330 will feature 34 full flat-bed seats with direct aisle access in BusinessElite, 32 extra-legroom seats in Economy Comfort and 227 Economy seats.

CNN —

A Thai Airways International flight arriving at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport late Sunday night skidded off the runway as it touched down.

Thirteen passengers were injured while evacuating the aircraft. There were no fatalities.

According to an airline statement, Thai Airways flight 679, operated with an Airbus A330-300 aircraft, departed Guangzhou, China, at 9:25 p.m. and arrived in Bangkok at 11:20 p.m.

After touching down, a landing gear malfunction caused the aircraft to skid off the runway, according to the airline.

Sparks were seen in the vicinity of the right-side landing gear, near the engine.

The airline says the pilot remained in control of the airplane until it came to a stop and its 14 cabin crew led the evacuation of all 288 passengers.

No passengers were reported injured during the actual landing.

“Thirteen passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation,” the airline said.

Injured passengers were transported to a local hospital.

“THAI will conduct an investigation as to the cause of the incident,” the airline’s parent company said in an official statement.

“At this stage Airbus has no detailed information on the event and therefore cannot comment,” an Airbus spokesperson confirms to CNN. “We are dispatching a team of experts to support both the investigation authorities and Thai Airways.”

Airport officials are still working to clear the runway and expect flight delays on Monday.

The incident is the second in two weeks for Thai Airways. At least 39 passengers were injured after an Airbus A380 with 500 passengers from Bangkok hit severe turbulence during its approach into Hong Kong International Airport on August 30.

Thai Airways International has established a hotline for information about the accident in Bangkok. The number inside Thailand is 02 545 3181. From outside the country, the number is +66 2 545 3181."
Airbus says Asia will lead global traffic by 2032 - Bangkok Post,"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZW5lcmFsLzM3MTczN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says Asia will lead global traffic by 2032

Asia-Pacific is surpassing Europe and North America in air passenger traffic, with annual volume expected to soar by about 200% by 2032 from last year's level, according to a new study conducted by European plane maker Airbus.

China and India will be the key drivers in the region's projected growth over the next two decades, with emerging regional countries contributing to a lesser extent.

The region's traffic, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) _ the number of paying passengers carried multiplied by the distance flown _ will grow from 1.6 trillion in 2012 to 4.8 trillion in 2032.

As a result, Asia-Pacific's RPK share of the world's total will account for 34% by 2032 from 29% registered in 2012.

But the RPK share of Europe will slip to 22% in 2032 from 26% in 2012, while that of North America will decline to 18% in 2032 from 25%.

According to Airbus's latest Global Market Forecast, the numbers of flyers around the world will increase by 3.8 billion over the next two decades, from today's 2.9 billion to 6.7 billion by 2032, as the attraction of air travel surges.

There will be more new flyers from emerging markets, with two-thirds of the population in emerging countries taking a trip in a year by 2032.

A growing middle class, more wealth, expanding tourism, internationalisation and the proliferation of low-cost carriers are also stimulating demand for air travel.

Asia-Pacific's middle class looks set to quadruple over the next 20 years.

Domestic traffic is also set to rise strongly, with India growing at the fastest rate (nearly 10%), followed by China and Brazil (7%).

The robust traffic trends mean that Asia-Pacific will account for 36% of all new global passenger aircraft demand over the 20-year period, estimated at 28,350 and valued at US$4.1 trillion, followed by Europe (20%) and North America (19%).

Some 10,400 new aircraft will replace existing ones.

With today's fleet of 17,740 aircraft, it means that by 2032 the worldwide fleet will double to nearly 36,560 aircraft.

Traffic growth has led to the average aircraft size growing by 25%, with airlines selecting larger aircraft or upsizing existing backlogs, Airbus said."

Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8? Cathay Pacific weighs up its options - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtb3ItYm9laW5nLTc0Ny04LWNhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLXdlaWdocy11cC1pdHMtb3B0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Don’t expect Cathay Pacific to place an order for the Airbus A380 or Boeing’s 747-8 Intercontinental any time soon.

Despite ongoing speculation that the Hong Kong carrier is set to sign up for one of the two duelling superjumbos, the airline seems quite happy with its stretched single-deck twin-engine jets such as the Boeing 777-300ER and, from 2016, the Airbus A350.

""The ‘big twins’ have definitely been very very successful for us” says Toby Smith, Cathay Pacific’s General Manager, Product. “They’re very efficient and the passengers love them, so they will definitely remain the core of our long haul fleet”.

“As for double deckers, nothing is excluded, it’s more a question of whether or not on selected routes there’s a need for a double decker” Smith tells Australian Business Traveller.

“For example, we now have four flights a day to Sydney. Would we go to five? Well actually we haven’t got any more rights – that’s still being looked at – so potentially that could be one market where you might see them, but it’s not on the horizon.”

Read: Cathay Pacific wants more flights to Australia

In the meantime, Cathay Pacific is continuing the retirement of its Boeing 747-400s, with the flagship Hong Kong-London route ditching the jumbo and switching to the more modern and fuel-efficient Boeing 777-300ER from the end of this year.

This will be Cathay’s eighth 747 put out to pasture since 2012, with 13 more to be progressively retired through this decade.

So what happens to a second-hand 747? Don’t go looking for them on eBay.

“We are always looking for opportunities to sell the retired aircraft as a whole or for parts” says a Cathay Pacific spokeswoman.

Boeing sometimes buys them back, and earlier this year inked a deal with Cathay to purchase four Boeing 747-400s to be converted into freighters.

Budget carrier Cebu Pacific unveils its Airbus A330 aircraft meant to become the first low-cost, long-haul flight by a Philippine carrier

MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) – Budget carrier Cebu Pacific unveiled its Airbus A330-300 aircraft that will be used for the first low-cost, long-haul flight by a Philippine carrier.

In a ceremony at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport grounds on Thursday, September 12, Cebu Pacific president and CEO Lance Gokongwei said the aircraft will be used for their inaugural Manila-Dubai flight in October.

The aircraft is meant for the Dubai route, but it will fly the Manila-Hong Kong and Manila-Cebu routes in the meantime.

This is Cebu Pacific’s second Airbus A330. The first, which arrived in June, is flying to Singapore and Incheon.

The airline’s Dubai flights will be 35% cheaper than the ones offered by other carriers, according to Gokongwei. Alex Reyes, vice president for long haul operations, said fares are less than $300 one-way.

The new wide-bodied aircraft has 436 all-economy seats and 8 toilets.

The aircraft will serve long-haul destinations, which “we cannot reach with our narrow-bodied aircraft,” Gokongwei said. Long-haul flights involve travel of over 4 hours.

Each flight will have 11 cabin crew who will sell food, merchandise items, and facilitate inflight games – a fixture in Cebu Pacific flights.

Food offered for sale onboard are at rates similar to those in international short-haul flights, the company said.

Below are some pictures taken inside Cebu Pacific’s A330 aircraft:

Passengers who want to be in seats with more legroom to make an 8-hour flight like Manila-Dubai more comfortable may opt to pay for more.

Cebu Pacific’s seat selector option has these price points:

Choosing a standard or regular seats during online purchase of plane tickets will cost an extra P250.

The option for “Standard Plus,” or seats with 32-inch seat pitch located at the rear section of the aircraft, costs an additional P500.

Passengers who prefer “Premium seats,” or those located at exit rows, costs P1,500 more.

Internet connection is available for a fee.

Prices for wifi services in A330 flights are as follows: $5 for 20MB; $10 for 50MB and $20 for 100MB.

The seats are reduced to pairs of two at the back of the plane.

The cockpit has space for 4 pilots to fly long haul. – Rappler.com"
Airline says landing gear had history of faults - Bangkok Post,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYW5na29rcG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMzY5MjM3L3RoYWktYWlyd2F5cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtMzAwLWhhcy1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLWxhbmRpbmctZ2Vhci1wcm9ibGVtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airline says landing gear had history of faults

Thai Airways International (THAI) said Wednesday it had encountered problems with landing gear on its Airbus A330-300 fleet prior to Sunday night's landing mishap.

Part of the landing gear had also been subject to an aviation watchdog warning.

A THAI A330-300 veered off the runway after landing at Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday, injuring 40 people.

THAI executive vice-president for the technical department, Flt Lt Montree Jumrieng, said Wednesday that preliminary testing showed the accident was the result of a defective bogie beam on the aircraft's landing gear. He said the faulty part caused the gear to collapse about 1km down the runway.

A bogie beam connects the wheels on an aircraft's landing gear horizontally and allows them to pivot on takeoff and landing.

According to Flt Lt Montree, Airbus recommended close surveillance of the bogie beams of its A330-300 planes when THAI ordered them. The landing gear was manufactured by French-based firm Messier-Bugatti-Dowty Co.

The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on June 29, 2011, about the landing gear of some Airbus aircraft series, including the A330-300.

The directive said during ground load test cycles, the main landing gear (MLG) bogie beam prematurely fractured as a result of its assembly method.

""Fracture of a MLG bogie beam under high speed could ultimately result in the aeroplane departing the runway, or in the bogie detaching from the aeroplane, or MLG collapse, which could cause structural damage to the aeroplane and injury to the occupants,"" the directive read.

EASA ordered a reduction in the existing MLG bogie beam life cycle.

""The bogie beam has a life span of 10 years and [the one which broke on Sunday] had not been replaced since it was first installed [in 2004]. But I can confirm that it was checked every two years,"" Flt Lt Montree said.

He said that due to the warning from Airbus, THAI checked the landing gear every two years and Airbus staff always took part in the inspections.

""We found[cracks on the bogie beams] on some of our A330-300 aircraft after three to four rounds of maintenance.

The affected parts were replaced,"" he said, stressing that THAI adheres strictly to maintenance regulations.

He said the airline operates 27 Airbus A330-300 aircraft. The plane involved in Sunday's accident was delivered in 1995 and was among the first batch of 12 A330-300s that THAI purchased.

This group of aircraft is due to be decommissioned between next year and 2017.

The bogie beam involved in Sunday's accident was last checked in February last year, when it was found to be in a usable condition, Flt Lt Montree said.

He added that the plane involved in the accident would require two new engines and three new bogie beams.

THAI senior executive vice-president Chokchai Panyayong said the landing accident had caused serious damage to the aircraft.

The plane was removed from Suvarnabhumi's eastern runway about 3.30pm Wednesday, and the runway was reopened at 8.10pm.

THAI president Sorajak Kasemsuvan had conducted a ceremony to pray for the smooth removal of the plane Wednesday morning after heavy rain delayed salvage efforts on Tuesday night."

Air Namibia to acquire two Airbus A330-200 - Namibian,"Wed, 04 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbWliaWFuLmNvbS5uYS9haXItbmFtaWJpYS10by1hY3F1aXJlLXR3by1haXJidXMtYTMzMC0yMDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AIR Namibia says the delivery of the first of its two Airbus A330-200 aircraft is scheduled for later this month.

Air Namibia said in a statement issued yesterday that the second A330-200 is expected to be part of the national air carrier’s fleet in November. The two aircraft are being leased from United States company, Intrepid Aviation for a 12-year period, Air Namibia said. The A330s will be used primarily on Air Namibia’s long haul route, between Windhoek and Frankfurt.

The statement said the Airbus A330-200 aircraft is an economically efficient aircraft that has become popular with airlines around the world.

“It has been deemed ideal for Air Namibia as the airline continues to explore ways of reducing operation costs. It has been estimated that with the introduction of the two A330-200 aircraft, Air Namibia will save up to N$510 million over 60 months in operating costs alone (N$8,5 million per month),” the airline said.

“The fleet upgrade ties in with our network expansion and frequency increase plans, using aircraft which have a combination of low operating costs, high efficiency, flexibility, customer appeal and optimized performance,” said Air Namibia Head of Corporate Communications Paulus Homateni Nakawa.

The A330s will come in a configuration of 244 seats, of which 30 are in business class and 214 in the economy class. Business Class seats will be full flat beds, while all seats in the aircraft including economy class will have “video/audio on demand” with individual monitors for each passenger.

Air Namibia’s on-board products will also improve significantly with the introduction of the Airbus A330-200 planes, and will contribute to meeting customer needs more optimally.

Air Namibia currently uses two Airbus A340-300 aircraft on the Windhoek-Frankfurt route, whose lease agreement expires in October. The new A330-200 aircraft have been built and configured in line with Air Namibia requirements and standards.

“From the range of aircraft types available, the A330-200 was found to be the most suited for our operations and conditions, given lower operating costs, high dispatch reliability, flexibility and appeal,” said Air Namibia General Manager for Commercial Services, Xavier Masule."

The Airbus A330-200 aircraft, which will be leased from US-based lessor Intrepid Aviation, will be used primarily on Air Namibia’s only long-haul route between Windhoek and Frankfurt replacing the two Airbus A340-300 aircraft whose lease agreement expires in October.

Delivery of the second aircraft is expected sometime in November.

Air Namibia said the Airbus A330-200 aircraft is an economically efficient aircraft popular with airlines around the world.

The airline said the aircraft is ideal for its operations as it continues to explore ways of reducing operation costs. With the introduction of the two aircraft to its fleet, Air Namibia expects to save up to N$510 million in operating costs over a five -year period representing monthly savings of N$8.5 million.

Head of Corporate Communications Paulus Nakawa said:“The fleet upgrade ties in with our network expansion and frequency increase plans, using aircraft with a combination of low operating costs, high efficiency, flexibility, customer appeal and optimized performance.”

The A330-200 aircraft offers 30 business class and 214 economy class seats as well as in-flight entertainment and flat bed seats which, when fully reclined, creates a bed that is fully flat.

Air Namibia said the introduction of the Airbus A330-200 planes will improve significantly its on-board products contributing to meeting customer needs more optimally.

Xavier Masule, the General Manager for Commercial Services at Air Namibia said the Airbus A330-200 was found to be the most suitable for the airline’s operations and conditions given the aircraft’s lower operating cost, high dispatch reliability, flexibility and appeal to customers.

The Airbus A330-200 is said to offer about 20% lower cost compared to the A340-300 because of its lower maximum take off weight of 230,000 kg compared to 257,000 kg of the A340-300, meaning lower landing fees and navigation charges.

Cost savings will also come from lower fuel burn as the aircraft has two engines compared to four engines in the previous aircraft. The two engines will also result in lower maintenance costs while there will be easy migration for pilots from the A340-300 because of fleet commonality.

The new aircraft will reduce available seats by 34 seats or 12% of the current capacity, but the old aircraft have brought some financial headaches to the airline after frequently going for unscheduled as well as scheduled maintenance."

“With our flights to Dubai using this brand-new Airbus A330 aircraft, we can bring Global Filipinos home faster, not just to Manila but wherever they may be in the Philippines,” said Gokongwei.

Cebu Pacific will operate direct flights between Manila and Dubai starting Oct. 7, offering 35% lower passenger fares than other carriers.

“We estimate over half a million Filipinos are working and living in the United Arab Emirates, and this figure is bound to increase in the future. When Cebu Pacific launches its long-haul services next month, it will be the first time a Philippine carrier lands in Dubai in 15 years. I hope that this will only inspire Cebu Pacific to remain committed to serving the Global Filipino community,” Binay said.

Cebu Pacific has a fleet of 47 aircraft comprising 10 narrow-body A319 planes, 27 A320s, two A330s and eight ATR-72 500 aircraft.

The national airline says the introduction of the two A330-200 aircraft would realise a saving of up to a whopping N$510 million over 60 months on operating costs alone. The savings translate into N$8,5 million per month, a significant amount of money for an airline that is currently under financial pressure, largely due to the competitive market. Latest figures from the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) show that the air travel market has been experiencing significant deterioration in recent months, with a somewhat stabilisation only recorded in June and July, during which the number of passengers on premium seats in international markets went up 4,1 percent than a year ago. Economy class passenger travel rose 4 percent in June year-on-year, in line with the 3,9 percent rise in May. “A look at the first six months of the year shows that growth in premium air travel has been subdued, with expansion of 3,2 percent from January to June 2013, compared to the same period in the previous year. This is below the 4,8 percent growth in premium travel seen throughout 2012,” IATA said. Global business confidence had started to increase strongly in late 2012 and into early 2013, but over the past several months, business sentiment had flat-lined. Growth in business-related premium travel has slowed accordingly, IATA said. Air Namibia’s chief spokesperson, Paul Nakawa, nevertheless said the fleet upgrade of the two airbus aircraft “ties in with our network expansion and frequency increase plans, using aircraft which are having a combination of low operating costs, high efficiency, flexibility, customer appeal and optimised performance.” The A330s will be used primarily on Air Namibia’s long haul route, between Windhoek and Frankfurt. The Airbus A330-200 aircraft is an economically efficient aircraft that is popular with airlines around the world. It has been deemed as ideal for Air Namibia as the airline continues to explore ways of reducing its operation costs. The A330s will come in a seat configuration of 244 seats, of which 30 are in business class and 214 in the economy class. Business Class seats will be full flat beds (180 degrees flat), while all seats in the aircraft including economy class will have “video/audio on demand” with individual monitors for each passenger. Air Namibia currently uses two Airbus A340-300 aircraft on the Windhoek-Frankfurt route, whose lease agreement expires in October, 2013. The new A330-200 aircraft have been built and configured in line with Air Namibia requirements and standards. “From the range of aircraft types available, the A330-200 was found to be the most suited for our operations and conditions, given lower operating cost, high dispatch reliability, flexibility and appeal to customers,” says Air Namibia General Manager for Commercial Services, Xavier Masule.
