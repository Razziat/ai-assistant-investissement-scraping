But it seems that they are looking at ways to one-up that plane with something even more amazing.

According to illustrations we found on Gizmodo, Airbus has been awarded a patent for a plane that has two fuselages, two sets of wings, and turboprop power.

Seriously.

It is believed that the twin wing/fuselage would reduce fuel consumption as the setup is lighter. What's very neat is that from the side, it looks like a regular plane, but around back it is truly something from another world.

And it just looks really, really cool.

We don't expect to ever see this in the air or at the airport, but it's ok to dream.

Boeing blasts Airbus' plan to assemble planes in Mobile (updated) - AL.com,"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9saXZlLzIwMTIvMDYvYm9laW5nX2JsYXN0c19haXJidXNfcGxhbl90b19hLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"-- As Airbus nears a decision on building a new aircraft assembly plant in Mobile, the European company is under attack from an old nemesis: Boeing Co.

Chicago-based Boeing released a statement today assaulting Airbus' plan and accusing the company of killing U.S. jobs.

""While it is interesting once again to see Airbus promising to move jobs from Europe to the United States, no matter how many are created, the numbers pale in comparison to the thousands of U.S. jobs destroyed by illegal subsidies,"" the statement said.

Airbus, a subsidiary of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., is planning a major announcement in Mobile on Monday. The Press-Register has reported that the company will unveil a proposal to assemble A320-family aircraft at the city’s Brookley Aeroplex.

Airbus has said that no “final decision” has been made about the project.

Airbus and Boeing are archrivals in the commercial aircraft market, and adversaries in a long-running legal fight before the World Trade Organization in which each accuses the other of receiving illegal government subsidies.

Boeing and EADS waged a fierce, politically charged battle for a U.S. Air Force tanker contract in which EADS’ foreign roots became a lightning rod. The five-year fight ended in 2011 when the Air Force picked Boeing for the lucrative contract, killing EADS’ plans to construct a $600 million aircraft assembly plant at Brookley. EADS had proposed to assemble its tankers and Airbus A330 freighters at the 1,400-worker factory.

Boeing’s desire to keep Airbus from gaining a production foothold on U.S. soil was an undercurrent in the competition. Boeing, with assembly plants in the Seattle area and Charleston, S.C., holds a monopoly on large aircraft production in the U.S. Airbus assembles its planes in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Tianjin, China.

Boeing argued during the tanker contest that EADS unfairly sweetened its bid for the contract with money it received from European governments. EADS contended that Boeing received similar support in the form of tax breaks and development work for NASA and the Pentagon.

Boeing continued to push those allegations Friday, saying that Airbus “and its European government underwriters” remained “in direct contravention of international trade law.”

Airbus declined to comment on the statement.

The Mobile assembly plant would give Airbus its first assembly site in America, improving its chances of winning new orders from U.S. airlines and strengthening the company’s position in bidding for future competitions for Pentagon contracts.

Aerospace analyst Michel Merluzeau said that Boeing’s argument was correct — to a point. He said interpretations of the WTO dispute vary greatly between the two camps, but that Airbus clearly has benefited from government loans in Europe.

Merluzeau said that Boeing’s argument that U.S. jobs were being destroyed was “excessive and inaccurate.”

“Any return of the industrial base to North America must be seen as a welcome development,” said Merluzeau, a managing partner at G2 Solutions, an aerospace consultancy in Kirkland, Wash. “There will be direct and indirect job growth with a potential (final assembly line) in Mobile.”

Others said that Boeing’s statement simply sounded like sour grapes.

“This is really reaching,” said Scott Hamilton of the Leeham Co. in Issaquah, Wash. “Is this really the best Boeing can do?”

"Boeing, Airbus Defiant Even as Airline Profits Plunge - CNBC","Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTIvMDYvMTEvYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZpYW50LWV2ZW4tYXMtYWlybGluZS1wcm9maXRzLXBsdW5nZS5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTIvMDYvMTEvYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZpYW50LWV2ZW4tYXMtYWlybGluZS1wcm9maXRzLXBsdW5nZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus, the world’s biggest aircraft manufacturers, say they aren’t that worried about a slowdown in the global airline industry, which is expected to see profits plunge by more than half this year.

The industry may be facing economic headwinds, especially in Europe, but Boeing hasn’t seen a significant pullback in orders, Jim Albaugh, Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplane told CNBC on Monday in Beijing.

“We’ve got a backlog of about 4,000 airplanes, that’s over $300 billion and we should do pretty good this year,” Albaugh said. ""You always have cancellations, you always have some deferrals. Yes, we have seen some, but nothing out of the ordinary.”

Boeing, which last year announced plans to build a newer version of its narrow-bodied 737, called the 737 MAX, has so far notched up around 450 orders. Speaking to CNBC, Albaugh said the company hopes to have a thousand orders for the plane before the year is done.

The global airline industry is expected to see from $7.9 billion last year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Monday. A double whammy of , which makes up a third of airlines’ cost, and a weak global economy, will continue to hurt the industry, Tony Tyler, Director General of IATA told CNBC on Monday.

“Fuel prices have come down a little bit but…It’s still very high by historic standards,” Tyler said. “And the reason it has come down is that the economic outlook is not so good. This is going to be a mixed blessing for airlines. The cost side is improving but if the economy weakens, traffic slows and yields fall, then it’s not going to make life much easier for airlines.”

Europe’s carriers are expected to lose $1.1 billion, double a previous estimate of $600 million released in March, IATA said on Monday, basing its forecast on the assumption that Brent crude will average $110 this year.

Despite a bleak economic environment, bright spots exist in North America and Asia, where profits will still hold up, Tyler said in Monday’s interview.

Airlines are in fact still placing orders and reports that manufacturers have had to aggressively slash prices are exaggerated, Airbus said on Monday.

“We’ve got a record high backlog right now,” John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer told CNBC in Beijing. “In fact, we’ve got about 4 to 5 years of production. If we don’t sell anything for the next 4 to 5 years, we’ll be running flat out with our assembly line so it’s a little bit exaggerated that there’s a price war going on.”

Airbus has received orders for about 250 planes so far this year, compared to net orders of around 1,400 last year after the company redesigned its narrow-body A320 with more fuel-efficient engines and wings. Orders for its new A320neo jets, helped the company post record sales last year, a feat unlikely to be repeated this year.

Chub class: Airbus makes wider airline seat for fat flyers who will get an extra two inches...but slimmer trav - Daily Mail,"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTIxNjAzMjIvQ2h1Yi1jbGFzcy1BaXJidXMtbWFrZXMtd2lkZXItYWlybGluZS1zZWF0LWZhdC1mbHllcnMtZXh0cmEtaW5jaGVzLS1zbGltbWVyLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtbG9zZS1zcGFjZS5odG1s0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjE2MDMyMi9hbXAvQ2h1Yi1jbGFzcy1BaXJidXMtbWFrZXMtd2lkZXItYWlybGluZS1zZWF0LWZhdC1mbHllcnMtZXh0cmEtaW5jaGVzLS1zbGltbWVyLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtbG9zZS1zcGFjZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chub class: Wider airline seat for fat flyers who will get an extra two inches...but slimmer travellers lose space



Airbus gives obese passengers an extra two inches as complaints soar from fellow travellers

Aisle seat will increase to 20in wide, but economy class seats will reduce by one inch

Airlines could charge for premium seat, with an estimated £2m generated over 15 years for each aircraft



Squeezing into a 'cattle class' airline seat is about to get a lot easier for the overweight traveller – but at the expense of more slimline passengers.



The growing girth of flyers has prompted aircraft manufacturer Airbus to design extra-wide seats for its popular A320 jets.



But it will shrink the size of ordinary economy-class seats so that each flight can still carry the same number of people.

Weighty issue: the passenger who caused problems on an American Airlines flight

Rather than have rows of three seats, each 18in wide, Airbus proposes making the aisle seat 20in wide and reducing the width of the two others by an inch each.



The new configuration would also allow airlines to impose an extra charge for the premium seats, with Airbus estimating that a £6.50 fee could generate an extra £2 million for each aircraft over 15 years.



That could help offset the extra fuel cost required to carry overweight passengers.

Airbus came up with the new design in response to requests from airlines who say travellers' expanding size has become a major headache.



Carriers say the most frequent complaint is from passengers forced to sit next to an overweight person who is encroaching into their space.



A recent survey found half of British flyers said overweight travellers should pay more for their ticket.



Budget airline Ryanair even mooted such a ""fat tax"", to cover the extra cost of transporting obese people.



Nicolas Tschechne, who conducts research at Airbus, said the rising weight of flyers was ""quite dramatic"".

Heavy price: EasyJet currently asks obese passengers to buy an adjacent seat at a discounted price before they board the plane

'Passenger size has emerged as a core issue we need to deal with,' he said. 'And sitting next to obese passengers is the number one complaint.'



John Leahy, chief operating officer for customers at the French-based manufacturer, said: 'Airlines are improving their margins by charging for bags, window seats and food.



'But what most people really want is space and that’s what we can offer.'



Air transport campaigner Sean Curtis-Ward said he had 'no problem' with slimmer passengers having narrower seats.



Mr Curtis-Ward, a spokesman for the Air Travel Advisory Bureau, said: 'I suppose some customers would complain that they are having to sit in smaller seats.



'I personally would not have a problem with that, as it's better than sitting next a very fat person who comes into your own space.



'But this could be good news for customers overall as they should be charged less – perhaps as much as £100 on a long-haul flight – because they are sitting in smaller seats.



'Let's face it, airlines will charge more for anyone booking the bigger seats. If airlines do not charge others less, we would have an issue with that.'

The manufacturer of this British Airways Airbus A320 has designed extra-wide seats for larger passengers

It is believed that the first A320 with the super-sized seats will be bought by an American airline, as the country has the largest proportion of overweight people.



About 30 per cent of US adults are classed as obese, which for a 5ft 9in person means they weigh more than 14st 7lb.



Some American carriers, including Delta, have tried getting passengers to buy an extra seat if they are obese.



The issue became very public in 2009, when an image circulated on the internet of an overweight passenger on an American Airlines flight from San Francisco.



After the photograph was taken, showing the man spilling into the aisle, he was reportedly given a full row of seats, which he did not have to pay for, so the plane could safely take off.



In the UK, easyJet asks obese passengers to buy an adjacent seat at a discounted price – sometimes at 50 per cent – before they board the plane.



Those who refuse are not allowed to board.



Similarly, Virgin Atlantic says that passengers who are too large are asked to purchase an additional seat.



Ryanair has reportedly even told its cabin crew to keep slim to keep the aircraft’s weight down.



It has also reduced the size of its in-flight magazine, and serves passengers less ice in their drinks.



British Airways prefers not to discuss the problem, saying only that ground staff deal with the matter in a sensitive way.

Wild new Airbus twin-fuselage patent designs in glorious 2D - Graphic Speak,"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZ2Z4c3BlYWsuY29tL2FyY2hpdmVzL3dpbGQtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy10d2luLWZ1c2VsYWdlLXBhdGVudC1kZXNpZ25zLWluLWdsb3Jpb3VzLTJkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The cutting edge of aviation thinking must still go 2D when submitting a patent application.

All current commercial aircraft are either single or dual aisle with the engines mounted on (turboprop) or under (jet) the wings. But that doesn’t stop aeronautical engineers from thinking out of the box about the future of air travel. Unfortunately, when they submit patent applications for cool new designs, the most technologically advance manufacturers have to revert to 2D when they send their ideas to the patent office.

Take the recent submission to the US Patent and Trademark Office from Airbus, for a double-fuselage aircraft. It is an idea for a high-capacity passenger airline that uses two fuselages, twin forward-sweeping wings, and turboprop propulsion. All illustrations submitted for the patent application—as required by law—are 2D line drawings.

The Airbus design for twin fuselages is not original; Germany built a few “zwilling” (German for “twin”) aircraft during World War II. Boeing submitted a patent for a commercial airliner using twin fuselages in 1979. Both the Airbus and Boeing patent applications say the design reduces wing bending, which helps to reduce total aircraft weight. The newer Airbus patent modifies the wing placement for increased lift and less turbulence.

Maybe someday we’ll see one of these designs become a real aircraft, but for now it would be good enough if we could just see the ideas in 3D."
Air France Flight 447 Investigation: Pilots Not Properly Trained to Fly the Airbus A330? - ABC News,"Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9haXItZnJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC00NDctaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1waWxvdHMtcHJvcGVybHktdHJhaW5lZC9zdG9yeT9pZD0xNjUwMzAwNdIBdmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1mbGlnaHQtNDQ3LWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tcGlsb3RzLXByb3Blcmx5LXRyYWluZWQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTY1MDMwMDU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 6, 2012— -- The Airbus A330 has one of the most sophisticated automated piloting systems in the airline industry, but the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 has some experts saying that the pilots weren't adequately trained to handle the plane in an emergency situation, and that the plane's stall alarm system may have added to the crew's confusion and contributed to the disaster.

The crash, which killed all 228 passengers and crew on board, is considered one of the worst -- and most mysterious -- aviation disasters in modern history. One theory for what caused that Airbus A330 to go down is that the two co-pilots, led by 58-year-old Captain Marc Dubois, were not properly trained and depended too heavily on the plane's autopilot system. That system disconnected at high-altitude when a speed sensor, called a pitot tube, froze over, sending inconsistent readings to the plane's computers.

Air France declined ABC News' request for an interview, pending the July release of the final report from France's investigation. But according to Bill Voss, the president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, Air France was so confident in the design of the Airbus A330, the airline had not trained nor prepared its pilots for the situation the crew of Flight 447 encountered the night of the crash.

""No one was trained for high-altitude stall recovery in the cockpit,"" said Voss. ""It's not part of the normal training curriculum...this is something that really has to be reformed globally. This is a really big deal.""

PHOTOS: Air France Flight 447 Crash Wreckage Recovered

Air France Flight 447 was en route from Rio de Janiero to Paris on May 31, 2009, for an overnight trip, when it vanished. The plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of June 1, 2009 -- nearly four hours after take-off.

Black box tapes were recovered from the wreckage two years later in April 2011 and, amazingly, still worked. The tapes revealed that almost four hours into the flight, the plane was 800 miles off the coast of Brazil, and Captain Dubois left the cockpit for a scheduled nap. At the time, the plane was about to fly into a thunderstorm, one that other flights that night had steered around.

Once in the storm, the plane's pitot tube, a critical piece of equipment that tells the pilot the aircraft's air speed, failed, likely from ice crystals forming on it, according to BEA officials who inspected the wreckage. When the pitot tube fails, the Airbus's automatic pilot system disengages, shifting control back to the pilot.

According to the tapes, First Officer Cedric Bonin, a 32-year-old pilot who had fewer than 5,000 flight hours under his belt, was at the controls but had never been in this situation before at high-altitude. Bonin made the fatal mistake of pulling the plane's nose up, which caused it to go into a deep stall.

""It seems that the pilots did not understand the situation and they were not aware that they had stalled,"" said Jean-Paul Troadec, the director of BEA, the French authority conducting the investigation into the Flight 447 crash.

When the Airbus A330 goes into a stall as severe as what happened to Flight 447, Voss said the plane's computer rejects the data it's receiving, thinking the plane couldn't possibly be flying in such a radical condition, and then shuts off the stall alarm.

""The computer is thinking 'this doesn't make any sense, we must be on the ground. We must be parked at the gate or we would be dead,'"" Voss said.

Airbus claims the stall alarm on Flight 447 ""was performing as designed,"" and said there is rationale behind its design.

""If you get as low as 60 knots, the stall warning will cut out by design, and we do that because on landings and take-offs at a low air speed, when the angle of attack is erratic and it may not be reliable, we cut that out so it would not distract pilots during take-offs and landings,"" said Bill Bozin, the vice president of safety and technical affairs at Airbus.

As co-pilot Cedric Bonin pulled continuously up on the controls, the stall alarm sounded for 54 seconds straight. But as Flight 447 went deeper into its catastrophic stall, the alarm cut in and out intermittently, the black box tapes revealed. The stall warning was working as designed, but critics charge the pilots would have been confused by the mixed signals.

The co-pilots called frantically for help from the captain, the black box tapes showed, but it took Dubois more than one minute to return to the cockpit.

BLOG: Where Was the Captain?

""What's happening?"" Dubois is heard asking when he re-enters the cockpit.

""I don't know what's happening,"" one co-pilot responded.

It was not until the final three seconds before the plane hit the Atlantic that the pilots even realized they were going to crash, the black box tapes revealed. Co-pilot David Robert is heard on the tape recording saying, ""Oh my God, we're going to crash. I can't believe it."" The last words on the recording are Bonin saying, ""But what's happening?""

The expansion would be in addition to their already existing order for 40 A320neos and 30 A321s, and would not come before 2015.

“We are looking at larger aircraft especially out of New York and especially Latin America. There is already plenty of service to Europe and Asia,” said Barger.

The announcement comes just days after the airline announced an expansion project at their JFK hub, called T5i, which will handle international traffic and customs.

Released schematics show that several of the new terminal’s gates, which will be built on the former site of Terminal 6, will be equipped for widebody use.

The move to widebodies would be a significant departure from the airline’s fleet of Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 jets, and may be the start of a significant expansion."
Airbus Unveils Double Fuselage Design - FLYING,"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy1haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1kb3VibGUtZnVzZWxhZ2UtZGVzaWduL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A recent patent awarded to Airbus by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office indicates engineers at the industry giant have quite a unique design up their sleeves – a double fuselage airliner, to be exact.

Design drawings associated with the patent, filed in 2008, show the fuselages connected by way of two forward-swept wings, with the front wing positioned lower than the rear upper wing. This configuration creates a particularly strong structure that can weather bending moments, allowing for a lighter weight aircraft and thus, potential fuel savings.

Lying centered amidst the aft wing in a longitudinal plane is the turboprop propulsion system, another key element of the aircraft’s potential for significantly decreased fuel requirements.

The authors of the patent request maintain the new structure is an answer to an earlier twin fuselage design put forth and patented more than 30 years ago by Boeing, which featured a lower forward straight wing and a very high straight aft wing connecting the dual cabins. According to Airbus, the new design’s swept wing configuration solves the excessive height challenge and high CG position featured in the Boeing design.

Whether the Airbus design will make more headway in the near future than that of Boeing’s undeveloped configuration is yet to be seen.

Airbus Shrugs Off Doubts Over A350 - CNBC,"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2lkLzQ3OTQzMTI30gEkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wL2lkLzQ3OTQzMTI3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fabrice Brégier said in his first interview since taking the top role at Airbus on June 1 that he believed the aircraft maker could hit its revised target to deliver the A350 to its first customer during the first half of 2014, describing the timetable as “challenging” but “achievable”.

Investors in EADS, Airbus’ parent company, are concerned about the possibility of serious delays on the A350 after acute production problems and delays with the A380 superjumbo.

These problems on the A380 have been a big drag on Airbus’ earnings and therefore EADS’ profit, with the superjumbo program’s status only due to switch from loss-making to break even in 2015.

Airbus’ A350 program has already been subject to two delays, pushing back the timetable for delivering the A350 to its first customer from the middle of 2013 to potentially the middle of 2014, partly because of problems with component suppliers.

Asked whether he could reassure investors that the A350 would not suffer the three year delay that Boeing’s widebody 787 encountered before reaching its first customer, Mr Brégier told the Financial Times: “I’m ready to take this bet [that there won’t be a three year delay].”

He went on to say Airbus would “[do] better, let’s put it this way, on the A350 than the market consensus believes we will do”.

Mr Brégier was in charge of the 10 billion euro-plus ($12.5 billion) A350 programme in his previous job of Airbus’ chief operating officer, and is retaining this responsibility as chief executive.

Boeing ran into serious delays with the 787 partly because it undertook a big technology leap by making the aircraft mainly out of carbon fibre reinforced plastic instead of aluminium alloy.

The carbon fibre is lighter than aluminum, and therefore provides significant fuel savings compared to current generation aircraft.

Airbus is embarking on a similar technology leap on the A350, with about 53 per cent of the aircraft due to be made from carbon fibre.

Boeing’s 787 programme also ran into difficulties because of problems with suppliers.

Airbus’ problems with suppliers on the A350 contributed to last November’s announcement by EADS that the aircraft’s “entry into service” date would be pushed back to the first half of 2014. EADS took a 200 million euro charge against its earnings.

Mr Brégier said he was seeking to ensure that the first A350 flight aircraft was free of glitches, so that production could be increased smoothly thereafter.

He insisted Airbus was well placed to grow its earnings, and so make a bigger profit contribution to EADS, on the back of increased aircraft production.

“I’m sure that we will increase gradually the profitability of Airbus,” he said.

Alisher Usmanov Purchases New Airbus and Yacht - Haute Living,"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaGF1dGVsaXZpbmcuY29tLzIwMTIvMDYvYWxpc2hlci11c21hbm92LXB1cmNoYXNlcy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWFuZC15YWNodC8yOTM2MjYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image: Reuters/Benoit Tessier

After selling his share in Facebook, billionaire Russian Alisher Usmanov has purchased an Airbus plane and a new yacht.

After making approximately $1.4 billion from his Facebook shares, Usmanov decided to go on a shopping spree that included buying a four-engine Airbus A340 for almost $250 million and a yacht named Dilbar for around $100 million.

Usmanov’s new airplane can fly up to 9,000 miles and could carry as many as 375 passengers. According to aviation industry sources, the jet could be the largest business aircraft in Russia and even in Europe. It is being reported that Usmanov, who is currently #28 on the Forbes Richest Men list, named the aircraft after his father, Bourkhan.

Usmanov’s new yacht was named after his mother, Dilber and the luxury vessel includes a gym, a dining room, a swimming pool, a helicopter pad and cabin space for 20 guests. There are also two jet skis and an autonomous diving compressor on board.

Engineers have pilot position in aerospace jobs market - Arab News,"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2VuZ2luZWVycy1oYXZlLXBpbG90LXBvc2l0aW9uLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1qb2JzLW1hcmtldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS: The race to sell airliners, particularly between Airbus and Boeing, is putting the aerospace companies of the world in cut-throat competition to recruit engineers.

There is a worldwide shortage of people with the qualifications needed by the companies gearing up to meet demand for an estimated 20,000 aircraft in the next 20 years.

The European airliner manufacturer Airbus for example is using Twitter accounts to talk to potential recruits and is to hold an international recruitment day on June 30th, interviewing 100 candidates from 15 countries selected from more than 6,500 applicants.

Tom Enders, who has just switched from the top management of Airbus to manage the parent group EADS, said that “the pool of talents in Europe at least has clearly become too small.”

Airbus says that of 12,000 jobs available in the sector in Europe last year, only 9,000 were filled.

At US aircraft maker Boeing, the vice president for human resources Rick Stephens told AFP that the United States produced 72,000 to 74,000 engineering graduates a year but “we don’t see enough students completing engineering degrees to be able to fill what we believe will be the needs” of the aerospace industry.

His counterpart at Airbus and EADS Thierry Baril said: “We must fight like hell on the international market to get the best talents.”

When Boeing closes a factory as it did this year at Wichita in Kansas, putting engineers on the market, “everybody pounds after them, Airbus and Bombardier,” Baril said. “It’s a little war for talent.”

The biggest companies say that even so, they manage to recruit owing to the strength of their brand names, but worry about problems encountered by their sub-contractors.

These companies can become weak links in the production chain when Boeing and Airbus increase their output.

The president of small and medium businesses in the organization grouping French aerospace firms (Gifas), Thierry Voiriot said that “engineers are more attracted by the big names and think that in these companies there will be more opportunities for development.”

This problem is exacerbated if big groups use head-hunting firms to try to attract engineers away from the smaller companies, he said, adding however that such behavior was the exception.

In general, the big manufacturers had a policy of trying to ensure that the entire industry would be supplied adequately with engineers in the next few years.

Stephens said that the US industry had been taking this approach for the last three years. “We all agreed that we would help create a large talent pool and then we could go and fight for them,” he said.

Firms in the sector work with schools and universities to help draw up programs which meet the future needs of the industry.

Airbus, and the third-biggest manufacturer in the world, Embraer of Brazil, run their own engineering schools.

The president of Embraer Aviation Europe, Luiz Fuchs, said: “We have our own school in Sao Paulo. This has been a very successful program where we attract people who have no possibility perhaps to go university. So we develop them, we pay attention to them, and we put them on the market.”

Promoting the image of engineers, with Hollywood

There is also a drive to raise the image of the engineer.

Lutz Bertling, the chief executive of Eurocopter which is part of the Airbus group and the world leader in the sector of civil helicopters, gives presentations in universities to attract students. He is himself an engineer.

Boeing has been working for a year with the film industry in Hollywood to improve the image of engineers who are often cast in a bad light, Stephens said.

Commenting on competition for engineers with information technology firms such as Google or Apple, Stephens said: “They are great paying jobs. You get more engineers doing better in aerospace than you may in the IT field.”

Boeing and Airbus also recruit on the international market.

Stephens said that Boeing, which does an increasing share of its business abroad, needs to attract talented people outside the United States.

Airbus goes a step farther, considering itself to be not a European but a world business.

Of 4,000 people whom it will recruit this year, 90 percent will be hired in Europe and the rest in India, in the United States, China and Russia, Baril said.

Enders said that Airbus would open an innovation unit in India to be managed by an Indian."
IN FOCUS: Is there room for both A330 freighter and conversion? - Flightglobal,"Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW4tZm9jdXMtaXMtdGhlcmUtcm9vbS1mb3ItYm90aC1hMzMwLWZyZWlnaHRlci1hbmQtY29udmVyc2lvbi8xMDU0OTQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has not had the best of times with freighter programmes in the past five years. First orders for the A380 freighter melted away due to delays with the passenger version, and then last year a planned A320 passenger-to-freighter joint venture was abruptly cancelled.

The A330-200 Freighter has also had its rocky moments, with its 2007 launch just in time to catch the global economic downturn, and orders dropping from 77 at their peak to 58 today. Then there was clamour for an A330 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion programme to be launched, a step Airbus seemed to be reluctant to take, perhaps for fear of cannibalising production freighter sales.

This last indecision at least seems to have been resolved, with EADS EFW, Airbus's conversion arm announcing the launch of a programme in February. Engineering development - something Airbus is too over-stretched to do itself - will be performed by ST Aerospace. The first deliveries are expected by 2016.

But will the converted freighters cannibalise demand for the production freighter? Even with its reduced order book, 29 of the outstanding 47 orders for the A330-200F are destined for lessors, all of whom are doubtless hoping to place the aircraft once the global economy recovers in a year or two. Will the prospect of cheaper conversions on the horizon undermine that market, as well as further production sales?

Airbus

As it is, the production freighter has arguably made a reasonable start, given the economic conditions. It won a new order of four aircraft from Avianca in September, its first Latin American customer, and as Jon Lesieur, freighter marketing manager for Airbus, points out, carriers who are already operating the A330F have also committed to further orders.

These include Etihad, the launch customer, which in January added two orders to the existing two it has in service. Turkish Airlines and MASKargo, the cargo arm of Malaysian Airlines, also boosted initial orders (MASKargo has four already in service, Turkish has two, with three to come). MNG Airlines of Turkey is about to become the latest carrier to take delivery.

Perhaps even more crucially, China - a key market that Airbus wants to conquer - is taking to the freighter. Hong Kong Airlines has three in service, leased from Aircastle, and five orders from BOC are destined for Yangtze River Express, with the first to be delivered later this year.

Even the fall in orders since 2007 can be explained away. One early order for 12 was from the mysterious Flyington Freighters of India which never saw the light of day, and some lessors switched from freighter to passenger orders simply because of unexpectedly strong demand on that side.

""There is good demand for passenger A330s at the moment, and we happened to close some campaigns there,"" says Volker Fabian, Intrepid's chief commercial officer, at Intrepid, which changed five of its 20 orders to passenger last year. ""But the freighters are a great medium- to long-term asset, and I continue to be very positive about them.""

This still leaves 29 lessor orders (15 for Intrepid, eight for Oak Hill Capital/Avion and six for MatlinPatterson) for which there are no announced customers as yet, and into this mix the A330 conversion programme has now been added.

Details are still being worked out for this, but early P2Fs will almost certainly be A330-300s, the oldest of which is now 19 years old. This will likely have 60-61t of payload, initially - for conversions of early 209t MTOW models - with range of 2,300nm, though eventually with a range of 3,600nm once 21st-century 233t MTOW conversion candidates become available.

This compares with a payload of 65t over 4,000nm or 70t over 3,200nm for the factory-built freighter. Conversions of the A330-200, which entered service in 1998, might have a payload of 59t over 4,000nm.

In 2011 EFW executives made bullish predictions about the orders that might flow for a conversion programme, but none have yet materialised. In particular, Qatar Airways, which pushed so vocally for the P2F programme to be launched, has so far been silent. ""We have no communication so far on orders, or on the type of aircraft we'll be using for conversion,"" said the airline when approached for this article.

Not surprisingly, John Howey, director of sales for EFW EADS says it is in dialogue with Qatar and other potential customers: ""That being said, there are a lot of details to be discussed until we have a product that satisfies Qatar's needs.""

Another unspoken potential customer for the conversion was surely FedEx, which has 76 MD-10Fs for which the A330-300P2F might seem the perfect replacement, as well as 71 A330-600Fs and 54 A310Fs for which the A330-300P2F would be an upgrade (28% more payload and volume than the A300-600F, and so the same cargo density). However, FedEx instead ordered 27 new 767-300ERFs in December, saying these were to replace its MD-10Fs.

This matters because Airbus pitches the -300P2F - with its extra 2,500sq ft of volume and three to four extra maindeck positions - as the ideal package freighter. By contrast it sees the factory-built -200F, with its greater range and density, as appealing to general cargo operators.

Airbus

Howey points out that FedEx was a big customer for A300 and A310 conversions in the past, and that it has 130 aircraft that the A330F might ultimately replace, not to mention future regional fleet growth. ""It is important to remember that the A330P2F will be around for at least 20 years or so,"" he says. ""For much of that time we'll be the only player in the medium widebody sector.""

Otherwise, Howey sees demand in China, Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America as trade within those regions develops. China is particularly exciting. ""The freighter fleet in the US increased fivefold between 1980 and 2000, much of it on the back of the express operators. China is at the very beginning of that growth curve, and in the end potentially much bigger.""

Question marks over the conversion programme include feedstock - at least in the shorter term until A350 deliveries start in 2014. If the A330 passenger variant remains so popular, will residual values come down enough?

There is also the question of the cost of the conversion. The A330-200 has a nose-down attitude in passenger operation that has to be corrected for freighter operation, and as a more modern aircraft than those previously converted, more precisely engineered to purpose, will need more work to design and simulate the modification. This will make it more expensive than the A300-600 conversion - but still cheaper than the production freighter, of course.

In the meantime, owners of the A330-200F seem happy, praising the aircraft's economics, its versatility on both regional routes and longer hauls - such as Istanbul to Shanghai, or Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai - as well as its ability to operate into smaller markets for which a B747F would be too large.

Fabian at Intrepid insists that there is huge interest from other carriers, particularly in Asia. ""Every airline we talk to there sees it as a fantastic aircraft for flying in the Asia-Pacific and to the Middle East, and if it was not for the global economy, I think we would already have a number of customers,"" he says. ""These are larger carriers with widebody equipment who feel the A330 would be the perfect complement to those larger freighters.""

For this reason, Fabian reckons that once the global economy recovers, the A330F will be very successful, but the question remains: successful for whom? Lessors, Airbus and EFW have all placed their bets. Can they all get the returns they are hoping for?

Russia's Transaero Signs Deal for Airbus A380 Jets - Naharnet,"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmFoYXJuZXQuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvZW4vNDQxODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russia's second-largest airline, Transaero, agreed Thursday to buy four Airbus A380 jets in a deal worth $1.7 billion becoming the first ex-Soviet carrier to order the world's biggest passenger jet.

The contract was signed by Transaero's general director Olga Pleshakova and Airbus Executive Vice-President Europe, Christopher Buckley at the annual Saint Petersburg Economic Forum.

""It is a historic moment for Airbus and this is the first contract in Russia and the CIS for A380,"" Buckley told journalists at the signing, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of ex-Soviet states.

""We are very confident that the fleet will not stop at four aircraft and we are looking forward to many more A380s to this first in Russia.""

Airbus and Transaero signed a preliminary deal on the purchase of the superjumbo jets last October with deliveries expected no earlier than late 2015.

The company said last August it had signed a preliminary agreement with Airbus, which is owned by European group EADS, to buy eight smaller A320neo planes with the option of acquiring four more jets."
Norwegian Confirms Order for 100 Airbus A320neo Planes - Naharnet,"Sat, 09 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmFoYXJuZXQuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvZW4vNDI4ODTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Low-cost airline Norwegian has confirmed its order of 100 Airbus A320neo planes with a list price of $9.6 billion (7.7 billion euros), Airbus said Friday.

The order, initially placed in January, was part of a massive deal to acquire the latest fuel-efficient aircraft that will put Norwegian in a strong position to further erode the position of traditional carriers.

""Brand new, fuel-efficient aircraft are necessary for us to continue to grow,"" Norwegian chief executive Bjoern Kjos was quoted as saying in a statement.

The 10-year-old airline also ordered 122 Boeing 737s, including 100 next-generation MAX8s, in January.

The Airbus order is the first ever for the rapidly-growing Norwegian, whose fleet has until now consisted only of Boeings.

Norwegian, once a tiny regional player in Norway, has battered its main rival, beleaguered semi-public Scandinavian carrier SAS, since being restructured as a low-cost airline in 2002.

Koss said #|100|# the beginning of this year it aimed to expand its fleet from 62 planes to 241 within 10 years and its European market share from two to six percent.

Airbus promises that the A320neo, which is due to enter service in 2015, will cut fuel consumption by 15 percent.

The announcement of the new version of its workhorse medium-range single-aisle aircraft last year set off a boom in orders from airlines that have been struggling with higher fuel prices, the top expense for many carriers. Rival Boeing later followed with its new version of the 737."

Posted: 6 June 2012 | Mark Glover, Commissioning Editor, International Airport Review |

Five years after its maiden flight, the Airbus A380 continues to grow its operations around the world. Key to the aircraft’s smooth consolidation with airports was Airbus’ early involvement with ground handlers. In this special interview, Mark Glover from International Airport Review spoke to two of Airbus’ key figures in the implementation; Peter Esteie, Head of Ground Operations and Thomas Burger, Product Marketing Manager of the A380.

Mark Glover: How successful has the A380 integration been within airports over the previous years?

Thomas Burger: Globally speaking we are very happy. We have 253 orders from 19 customers where all three global alliances are represented. The first delivery took place in October 2007 and today we have 72 aircraft in service. We have seven operators operating these 72 aircraft, flying across 54 routes to 28 destinations. In terms of seat count, the lowest of 407 is on board the Korean Air aircraft. Airfrance carries the most on its A380 with 538 seats.

The top ten A380 airports within the 28 destinations see 100 flights a day, which represents over one million passengers a month. The route lengths also vary, spanning from two hours from Dubai to Jeddah to 14 hours from Melbourne to Los Angeles.

In terms of new routes for 2012, Emirates will be flying from Amsterdam and Lufthansa will be touching down in Houston.

Although 28 A380 destinations does not seem like a huge amount, it is worth noticing the concentration of other large aircraft around the world. There are around 40 airports today that accommodate 80 per cent of the world’s 747 movements. For us, it is not about dots on maps, as long as the right airport is ready at the right time then that is the most important thing for us. We jointly created the A380 Airport Compatibility Group (AACG) which outlines aircraft specific airside requirements to minimise the modifications, and provide an equivalent level of safety as ICAO Code F recommendations.

Airports are generally extremely proactive when airlines inform them that they are bringing the A380 to their destination as they recognise the benefits and we are very happy with the way the relationship is continuing. More than 20 additional airports are ready today or making preparations to accommodate the aircraft in the next few years.

We are also currently visiting airports within our demo tours of the A380 with the most recent being Brazil, adding Rio to the list. In total we have visited 142 airports around the world in various guises, from small including Sharm el-Sheikh Airport and Tarbes Airport west of Toulouse to most of the world’s major hubs."
Airbus planning to house its innovation cell in Bangalore - The Hindu,"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtcGxhbm5pbmctdG8taG91c2UtaXRzLWlubm92YXRpb24tY2VsbC1pbi1iYW5nYWxvcmUvYXJ0aWNsZTM1NTkyMDYuZWNl0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFubmluZy10by1ob3VzZS1pdHMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1jZWxsLWluLWJhbmdhbG9yZS9hcnRpY2xlMzU1OTIwNi5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"June 22, 2012 11:41 pm | Updated 11:52 pm IST - BANGALORE:

Global aircraft manufacturer Airbus aims to source $1 billion worth of equipment and services from its Indian entities by 2020, said Kiran Rao, Executive Vice-President, Sales and Marketing and Customer Affairs, Airbus, on Friday. The company, which already sources software and engineering services from its facility in Bangalore, is setting up an innovation cell, which will be operational by the end of the year, Dr. Rao told The Hindu .

“This will not be an engineering centre, but will work with other Airbus units to develop new designs and concepts,” Dr. Rao said. “With the aviation market moving from the Western Hemisphere to the East, concepts of aircraft design should be coming from the East,” he said. “We have decided that our think tank for determining how aeroplanes should be, and how they should interact with airports and passengers and how pilots should interact with the craft would be headquartered in Bangalore and be headed by an Indian,” he said.

Airbus’ pilot training centre in Noida would be operational by 2013, Dr. Rao said. The facility would have the “capability” to train 5,000 pilots annually, but it would start operating only three simulator bays for training initially. The facility can provide initial and recurrent training, and jet orientation training.

Dr. Rao said 200 Airbus aircraft were already flying in India; 400 more were due for delivery, most of them by 2020. About 90 per cent of these would be A-320s, Dr. Rao added. Deliveries of four A-330s for Jet Airways, which were deployed on long-haul flights, would commence in October, he said.

India, Dr. Rao said, was the company’s fourth most important market, after China, the U.S. and the U.K. Indian commercial airliners were likely to purchase 1,043 aircraft over the next 20 years, he added. “Last year, we sold more than 270 aircraft to Indian airline companies, about 50 per cent of all aircraft sold by us worldwide.”

Dr. Rao attributed the problems of the Indian airlines to the high cost of fuel and user fees at Indian airports. “Delhi is, perhaps, the second most expensive airport in the world for airline companies,” he observed. “It is a fine airport, but it is not paved with gold,” he quipped."

The issue of granting sanction for prosecution has been deferred for the last seven months, the sources said.



The ministry had sent back the file to the CBI earlier saying the agency may reconsider its decision to file an FIR against its officials, including one of the rank of Additional Secretary.However, the CBI persisted with its request claiming their was prima-facie evidence to initiate a probe, the sources said.



The aviation ministry had reasoned out that the responsibility on the officials was not as big as projected by the CBI in its findings but the agency wrote back saying that it stuck to its findings.

Etihad selects Sharklets for new A320 fleet - Arabian Aerospace,"Wed, 06 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZXRpaGFkLXNlbGVjdHMtc2hhcmtsZXRzLWZvci1uZXctYTMyMC1mbGVldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deliveries of the Sharklet-equipped A320s to Etihad Airways will begin in the third quarter of 2013.

The Abu Dhabi based carrier started taking delivery of its 20 A320s on order in the last quarter of 2011. Once in service, the A320s equipped with Sharklets will make Etihad Airways’single-aisle fleet one of the most modern and fuel efficient in the Middle East.

Etihad Airways President and Chief Executive Officer, James Hogan, said: “In today’s climate, our airline is fully focused on maximizing the environmental efficiency of the entire fleet.

“By growing our fleet with the modern, fuel efficient Sharklet-equipped A320, we’ll be able to reduce fuel burn which is central to our goal of growing profitability in the years ahead.”

Today, Etihad Airways’ fleet of Airbus aircraft comprises 50 Airbus passenger aircraft (17 A320 Family, 33 A330/A340 Family) and two A330-200 Freighter aircraft. The additional 43 aircraft to be delivered from existing orders, including 10 A380s, will grow Etihad Airways’ total Airbus fleet to 95 aircraft.

“We are very happy to see Etihad join the increasing number of carriers selecting our new fuel-saving Sharklets”, said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “The A320 already has the best economics and highest reliability of any single-aisle aircraft today. To further boost the aircraft’s productivity by adding the Sharklet, makes good business sense.”

Offered as an option on new-build aircraft from the end of 2012, the devices increase payload-range and improve take-off performance. The new wing tip devices will result in around 3.5% reduced fuel burn over longer sectors, corresponding to an annual CO2 reduction of around 1,000 tonnes per aircraft."
AirlineReporter - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vcGFnZS8zMTEvP3JlZj14cmFua3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is a guest post written by Malcolm Muir for AirlineReporter.com. Here is his experience with Bolt Bus in his own words (note: Malcom paid his own way there and back) …

A last minute trip north to Vancouver gave me the opportunity (and an excuse) to try out Bolt Bus. Bolt is a new entrant to the Pacific Northwest market and started operations late May. Bolt is owned and operated by Greyhound and from stories I had heard about service etc. from Greyhound I was a little apprehensive.

Costs were extremely good. A one way ticket method cost the day before departure was only $33 round trip (including the $1 booking fee). This was for a late Friday evening departure and mid-Sundays afternoon return so prime services. Like the airlines, fares can vary depending on the time of day as an earlier return from Vancouver would have saved around $10. Fares start at $1 with Bolt Bus so if you can get in early enough with the booking fee could be $3 round trip.

The boarding passes/booking confirmation is emailed and/or texted to you immediately and you’re set. Bolt Bus boards by groups similar to airline zones (unsure how they are assigned though as I was given Group A for both tickets) which helps to ensure that people won’t just rush the bus when it arrives.

Seattle is the middle point for journeys in either direction so there could be delays that hold up the bus (such as traffic in heavy times) however my bus arrived from Portland about 10 minutes prior to its scheduled departure to Vancouver.

Unfortunately, there currently isn’t any signage at the Seattle departure point (5th Ave S & King Street, the International District bus station) so there were many people milling about with worried looks on their faces asking “does Bolt Bus go from here?”

The buses are all modern looking, with leather seated interiors, more seat pitch compared to the competitors, and power points at each row (mounted to the row in front, so avoid the first row as none fitted). Free Wi-Fi is offered inboard however it only works as far as the Border crossing as they don’t seem to have coverage in Canada.

One downside of the seat is the lack of a tray table. There is ample room for it to fit and would definitely make working with a laptop easier but it’s not a deal breaker.

Both trips were lightly loaded, so a set of two seats to myself allowed me to spread out the gear and get some work done. Heading north, the traffic was light and the 8pm departure time avoids most of the I5 traffic snarls of an afternoon. We departed a few minutes late out of Seattle, but this, again, is not a deal breaker.

Bolt Bus allows 2 hours from Seattle north to the border, 30 minutes for the border crossing and another hour into Vancouver, ample time in the 2 hours to catch him up and also relax into the weekend.

The border crossing heading north was uneventful other than having ingredients to wait for 5 minutes while they found some staff, a few questions and I was stamped into Canada. The continued journey resumed right at the 30 minute mark (they leave once everyone is processed so this is where scheduled time could take a hit) and completed the journey into Vancouver in the allotted 1 hour.

Since there is no food service and no stops between Seattle and Vancouver, you need to bring it with you. I took stuff with me on the bus and had no problems, however be mindful of the border crossing as some foods can’t go over (saw a lady have to bin an apple at US customs). The Seattle stop is a good location to pick up some food as it’s right next to Uwijamaya for some good Japanese/Asian food and drinks at non airport pricing.

There is a bathroom on board the bus, but luckily I did not end up having to use it.

We arrived into a deserted Pacific Central at 1135pm and it is a bit nerve racking to not see any cabs at the terminal but I am sure this will be against changed in the long run once Bolt have been up and running longer.

The journey south was even more painless as there was an extremely light load. The driver separated the boarding groups to control the group easier but in this instance probably was not needed as much. Traffic was very light for a Sunday afternoon and we made the border early and with customs & immigration taking only 15 minutes for the load we were back on the road early.

After an amazing sight returning to Seattle with a blue sky and a magnificent view of Mt Rainer from I5 we actually arrived 30 mins early. A smooth painless journey in either direction.

The journey with Bolt Bus was definitely an easy one, from the simple booking process to the journey itself, more reminiscent of an ultra-express service as no stops are made between cities. A couple of issues do need to be addressed such as connectivity across the border and signage at departure points; however for the price it’s not that big of an issue.

Bolt Bus favors highly over the direct competitors such as Greyhound and Quick bus. But there would be good competition from Amtrak. With Bolt Bus, if loads are light border crossings would be much quicker than Amtrak as they do not have to work through an entire training load of people, however Amtrak is not at the mercy of traffic problems so if a journey was made during the prime peak hour times, this could obviously add significant delays.

Compared to flying though the price is definitely a big difference as a last minute return with Air Canada was pricing in at $600 return for Best Available fare. Amtrak fares were around $100 return.

If you can get the fares for as little as $1 each way, then Bolt bus is definitely a fantastic option and can only improve as the service gets a bit more popular and has time to be able to settle into the PNW market."
