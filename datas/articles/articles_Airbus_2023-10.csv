Airbus renews its transatlantic fleet with lower-emission ships - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1haXJidXMtcmVuZXdzLWl0cy10cmFuc2F0bGFudGljLWZsZWV0LXdpdGgtbG93ZXItZW1pc3Npb24tc2hpcHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 25 October 2023 - Airbus will renew the entire fleet of chartered vessels that transport aircraft subassemblies between production facilities in Europe and the United States with three modern, low-emission roll-on/roll-off vessels, supported by wind-assisted propulsion.

Airbus has commissioned shipowner Louis Dreyfus Armateurs to build, own and operate these new, highly efficient vessels that will enter into service from 2026.

The new fleet is expected to reduce average annual transatlantic CO 2 emissions from 68,000 to 33,000 tonnes by 2030. This will contribute to Airbus' commitment to reduce its overall industrial emissions by up to 63% by the end of the decade - compared to 2015 as baseline year - in line with the 1.5°C pathway of the Paris Agreement.

“The renewal of our marine fleet is a major step forward in reducing our environmental impact,” said Nicolas Chrétien, Head of Sustainability & Environment at Airbus. “The latest generation of vessels proposed by Louis Dreyfus Armateurs are more fuel efficient than their predecessors, using cutting-edge technologies like wind-assisted propulsion. This demonstrates our determination to lead the way in decarbonising our sector by innovating not just in aviation, but across all our industrial operations.”

“We are very pleased to have been selected by Airbus to develop this state-of-the-art and low-emission fleet and to continue our longstanding partnership,” said Edouard Louis-Dreyfus, President, Louis Dreyfus Armateurs. “This new project, setting high targets, reflects our ambition regarding the decarbonisation of the shipping industry. We are proud to support our customers in their energy transition, going even beyond their expectations by offering innovative solutions and sustainably driving change.”

Airbus will gradually renew the chartered vessels that ferry its aircraft subassemblies across the Atlantic between Saint-Nazaire, France, and its single-aisle aircraft final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

The new vessels will be powered by a combination of six Flettner rotors - large, rotating cylinders that generate lift thanks to the wind, propelling the ship forward - and two dual-fuel engines running on maritime diesel oil and e-methanol. Additionally, routing software will optimise the vessels’ journey across the Atlantic, maximising wind propulsion and avoiding drag caused by adverse ocean conditions.

The fleet renewal also supports Airbus ambition to increase A320 family production rate to 75 aircraft per month by 2026. Each new transatlantic vessel will have the capacity to transport around seventy 40-foot containers and six single-aisle aircraft sub assembly sets - wings, fuselage, engine pylons, horizontal and vertical tail planes - compared to three to four sets with current cargo ships.

"Airbus marks milestone in growth project adding 1,000 jobs in Mobile - Made In Alabama","Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvYWlyYnVzLW1hcmtzLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1pbi1ncm93dGgtcHJvamVjdC1hZGRpbmctMTAwMC1qb2JzLWluLW1vYmlsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Governor Ivey said the addition of 1,000 new jobs at the Airbus facility will push total employment there to 2,800.

NEW A320 FAL

“In 2025, 1,000 more Alabamans will have an opportunity to build the finest commercial aircraft in the world.”

The centerpiece of Airbus’, announced in May 2022, is the addition of a new, 350,000-square-foot A320 Family Final Assembly Line (FAL) to ramp up production of the in-demand passenger jet.

Overall, the growth plans include over a dozen new structures that will add 1 million square feet of space to Airbus’ U.S. Manufacturing Facility, effectively doubling the aircraft plant’s production area.

Airbus is targeting the third quarter of 2025 for completion of the expansion project, which follows the addition of a FAL for A220 aircraft.

“This just felt like the right time as we really put the big pieces of it in the ground,” said Daryl Taylor, Airbus’ Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations in Mobile. “We will have the capacity to double the output we have today.”

Bob Smith, the Alabama Department of Commerce’s aerospace specialist, said Wednesday’s Expansion Ceremony underscores the rapid growth that’s unfolding on the Airbus campus at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley industrial park.

“This is really the next step in the project that will add the third Final Assembly Line in Mobile,” Smith said. “In 2025, 1,000 more Alabamans will have an opportunity to build the finest commercial aircraft in the world.”

Since entering Alabama, Airbus has invested over $1 billion its Mobile manufacturing facility.

“As we break ground on this new chapter in Alabama’s aerospace journey, let us celebrate this achievement and look forward to a future where our state continues to be a leader on the global stage,” Governor Ivey added.

“The best of us, of Alabama, is still yet to come.”

"Airbus vows to stay in hunt for Air Force contract, despite reported loss of partner - Fox 10 News","Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMjMvYWlyYnVzLXZvd3Mtc3RheS1odW50LWFpci1mb3JjZS1jb250cmFjdC1kZXNwaXRlLXJlcG9ydGVkLWxvc3MtcGFydG5lci_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxMHR2LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwLzIzL2FpcmJ1cy12b3dzLXN0YXktaHVudC1haXItZm9yY2UtY29udHJhY3QtZGVzcGl0ZS1yZXBvcnRlZC1sb3NzLXBhcnRuZXIvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - Despite the reported loss of their partner, Airbus officials say they are not giving up their effort to win a piece of a lucrative U.S. Air Force contract.

Reuters reported Monday that Lockheed Martin was pulling out of the sweepstakes for a contract to build aerial refueling tankers. Airbus hopes to assemble those planes in Mobile.

Airbus and Lockheed had teamed up in an attempt to win a contract to build 75 of the flying gas stations, using the Airbus A330. Lockheed’s exit gives a boost to Boeing Co., which currently has the contract but has been plagued by problems.

The new contract could be worth $12 billion or more.

Airbus told FOX10 News that it is not giving up.

“Airbus remains committed to providing the U.S. Air Force and our warfighters with the most modern and capable tanker on the market and will formally respond to the United States Air Force KC-135 recapitalization RFI,” the company said in a prepared statement.

The firm added that the A330 is “a reliable choice for the U.S. Air Force: one that will deliver affordability, proven performance and unmatched capabilities.”

With or without the Air Force contract, the Airbus complex at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley continues to grow. The company is building a third final assembly line.

Lockheed drops US Air Force tanker bid; partner Airbus to go it alone - Defense News,"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAyMy8xMC8yMy9sb2NraGVlZC1kcm9wcy11cy1haXItZm9yY2UtdGFua2VyLWJpZC1wYXJ0bmVyLWFpcmJ1cy10by1nby1pdC1hbG9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin has ended its effort to compete for a U.S. Air Force contract to build the service’s next wave of 75 refueling tankers.

But Airbus, with whom Lockheed Martin had planned to build the proposed LMXT strategic tanker, will still compete for the KC-135 recapitalization. LMXT would have been based on Airbus’s A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport.

“Airbus remains committed to providing the U.S. Air Force and our warfighters with the most modern and capable tanker on the market and will formally respond to the United States Air Force KC-135 recapitalization” request for information, an Airbus spokesperson said in a Monday statement to Defense News. “The A330 U.S.-MRTT is a reliable choice for the U.S. Air Force; one that will deliver affordability, proven performance and unmatched capabilities.”

Lockheed spokeswoman Stephanie Stinn said in an earlier statement the company had decided not to respond to the Air Force’s RFI. The news was first reported by Reuters.

Stinn said Lockheed plans to transition the team and resources working on the proposed LMXT strategic tanker to other programs, including the next-generation aerial refueling system, or NGAS, program.

In a follow-up email, Stinn said the Air Force’s decision earlier this year to accelerate NGAS was one of several factors that led it to drop its pursuit of LMXT and focus on the next-generation tanker, along with other elements in the recent RFI. Lockheed declined to say how much it and Airbus spent to develop LMXT.

Lockheed’s choice to drop out of the tanker competition could increase competitor Boeing’s chances of selling more KC-46 Pegasus tankers to the Air Force for the next phase of the service’s multibillion-dollar effort to replace its legacy KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft.

The Air Force has established a three-stage process for recapitalizing the KC-135, with the now in-process acquisition of 179 KC-46s representing its first phase.

But the service this year reshuffled its acquisition plans for the second and third phases of the tanker recapitalization. Originally, the Air Force planned to buy about 150 tankers in the second phase, and Lockheed teamed up with Airbus to pitch LMXT for this procurement. But for at least a year and a half, top Air Force officials, including Secretary Frank Kendall, have strongly suggested they were leaning toward buying modified KC-46s for the next phase.

In March, the Air Force announced it was revamping its tanker plans and would cut the planned purchase of second phase tankers in half, to about 75. As part of its new tanker strategy, the Air Force also sped up plans to acquire NGAS.

The Air Force’s surprise slash of the tanker buy was a blow to LMXT. But Lockheed continued to push forward, and in June the company announced it chose a General Electric Aerospace engine for LMXT. A Lockheed official told reporters at the time the company hoped the engine choice would show the Air Force that LMXT would be a viable solution for its tanker needs.

The Air Force’s deputy program executive officer for mobility aircraft, Scott Boyd, told reporters in Dayton, Ohio, in late July that a KC-46 purchase was not a foregone conclusion. But he said the service would have to see if its market research showed a viable alternative to the KC-46 exists.

Airbus celebrates ongoing expansion that will add 1000 new jobs - AL.com,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIzLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLW9uZ29pbmctZXhwYW5zaW9uLXRoYXQtd2lsbC1hZGQtMTAwMC1uZXctam9icy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A massive expansion of Airbus’ manufacturing facility in Mobile remains on track to create 1,000 new jobs, with jetliners coming off a new assembly line and hitting the sky starting in 2025, company officials said at a Wednesday celebration of progress on the project.

The view of the Airbus campus from the pavilion set up for Wednesday’s gathering oversaw a giant construction site. Between the bare dirt, the mounds of materials and the steady stream of dump trucks rumbling past, it was clear that the occasion was neither a groundbreaking nor a ribbon cutting. Instead, the “expansion ceremony” was a chance for elected officials from the state, city and two counties to wax enthusiastic about the teamwork that had facilitated Airbus’ development so far. For Airbus executives, it was a chance to praise the welcoming environment and to reaffirm an aggressive growth plan.

Daryl Taylor, vice-president of commercial operations with Airbus USA, said the timing of the event wasn’t tied to any one key development, but just felt right.

“We announced our expansion in May 2022, and we just felt today and this week was the right time,” he said. “We had the series of milestones including really breaking ground on our new final assembly line which is the corner piece of the expansion. It just felt like the right time as we put the big pieces in the ground.”

The most substantive language came from Gerd Weber, whose title at Airbus is head of A320 value stream management and final assembly lines. Airbus has been delivering A320-family jets produced on a Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Mobile since 2017. It’s one of four sites where the single-aisle jets are built, alongside FALs in France, Germany and China.

“The A320-family program is the major source of income for Airbus,” said Weber, underscoring the stakes. The family, which includes the popular A31neo and other variants, comprises 84% of the company’s commercial order book, with more than 6,000 jets on order.

Airbus has said it wants to be delivering 75 of the jetliners per month by 2025 or 2026, in combined output from Mobile and three other sites. That’s a rate well beyond pre-pandemic levels, and it sounds like a lot – but Weber said it is “absolutely essential” that Airbus carry out its ambitious plans to ramp up production.

“Our customers … are desperately awaiting their aircraft, and they want even more,” he said. The global market for single-aisle jetliners is estimated at 30,000 over the next 20 years, with around 8,000 needed for North America and Latin America.

Taylor concurred. “When you look at the growth and the 6,000 aircraft backlog on the single aisle alone … we made a commitment to build 75 a month. The only way we get to that is by adding this expansion, the third final line in Mobile,” he said.

Airbus plans to have the final assembly line project completed by mid-2025. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com).

“Mobile is going to be the third largest final assembly line in Airbus, after Toulouse and Hamburg,” said Weber. “This is going to be our flagship in North America. Not only [in] numbers but also in latest-generation infrastructure, state of the art Final Assembly Lines, latest automation technology … and all that supported by a strong, fantastic culture that we experience here.”

Weber hinted that as it grows, the Mobile facility may come to depend less on Europe and to enjoy more autonomy.

Weber praised local leaders for making it all possible, with infrastructure work and other help. “I can say this is really an exceptional level of support that I experience here [and] it is not the same everywhere,” Weber said.

“Folks, we are rising to the occasion,” said Gov. Kay Ivey. “This is Team Alabama at its best. … Alabama stands ready to roll up our sleevesand get the job done.”

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson offered an interesting glimpse of the behind-the-scenes challenges.

“Airbus, what you’ve done for us is something that I’m not sure we could have ever imagined years ago,” said Stimpson. “You’ve changed the image of our city.”

“But the other thing you did for us is, you stretched us,” Stimpson continued. “You caused us to do things that we had no clue that we could really do. We made a lot of promises on the front end, we were hoping we could do them, but you know I think that by now we’ve shown you that we can do them. And we will continue to do that.”

Part of that, he said, is for the city to continue investing in the quality of life the city offers Airbus employees.

Airbus also builds a smaller family of jets, the A220 family, in Mobile. The overall expansion focuses mainly on expanding capacity for A320s, but it’s not as simple as adding a second assembly line: It involves new paint facilities, new hangars, and expansion of the delivery center and more.

Company officials said that Airbus currently employs about 1,800 people at the facility, with plans for that to rise to around 2,800 as the new facilities become operational.

“We have 1,800 employees in Mobile working in the final assembly lines,” said Taylor. “Airbus in the community has 2,200 (when adding in the) engineering center and space and defense center that was here before (the FALs). We committed to 1,000 new jobs.”"

Airbus Helicopters pioneers user-friendly ways to fly eVTOLs - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtcGlvbmVlcnMtdXNlci1mcmllbmRseS13YXlzLXRvLWZseS1ldnRvbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane – Airbus Helicopters' demonstrator FlightLab has successfully tested an electric flight control system in preparation of a new human machine interface (HMI) that will equip CityAirbus NextGen, Airbus’ eVTOL prototype. This milestone represents an important step towards ushering in a new generation of electric powered urban air mobility aircraft.

The pilot controls have been considerably simplified thanks to the enhanced piloting assistance provided by the electric flight control system. Marking a first in the helicopter industry, one single piloting stick replaces the three conventional pilot controls (cyclic, pedals, collective) and is able to control all aircraft axes. Using the single stick, the pilot is able to perform all maneuvers: take-off & landing, climb, descent, acceleration, deceleration, turn, and approach.

The single stick takes up less space, offers improved visibility to the pilot and is combined with a revised HMI which uses simple displays, providing a selection of information specifically tailored to eVTOLs.

“From the start, we designed this system considering every certification parameter in mind as it will be a big step forward in validating the design of our urban air mobility eVTOL, CityAirbus NextGen. The advantage of an electric flight control system is enormous, especially when it comes to reducing pilot workload and ultimately enhancing mission safety. It is also a great example of how our demonstrators are used to mature the techno-bricks necessary to prepare the future of vertical flight,” says Tomasz Krysinski, Head of Research & Innovation at Airbus Helicopters.

After the success of the flight test campaign Airbus Helicopters is working on finalising the details of this new system before new tests are conducted in the framework of Vertex, a project conducted in partnership with Airbus UpNext that will advance autonomy even further by managing navigation and simplifying mission preparation.

Airbus has been one of the pioneers in exploring how electric propulsion can help drive the development of new kinds of aerial vehicles. In September 2021, the company unveiled its fully electric eVTOL prototype, CityAirbus NextGen. Airbus is developing an advanced air mobility solution with eVTOLs, not only to offer a new mobility service, but also as an important step in its mission to reduce emissions in aviation across its product range.

The trials took place on board the French Navy frigate, Provence, in the Mediterranean Sea between the 2nd and the 9th of October. The vessel had previously been adapted by Naval Group to operate the SDAM. These sea trials were arranged to demonstrate the system’s high performance from an operational warship and the SDAM’s capabilities for surveillance and intelligence missions.



“We are proud to see that the SDAM and the VSR700 are maturing,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The system that we will offer will be able to operate from a frigate and be adapted to the naval missions it was designed for,"" he added. “Working alongside Naval Group and other local partners we are building a robust and sovereign solution. I look forward to further demonstrating the potential of our system and to collaborating with the French Navy in order to offer an initial operational capability by 2026.”



“We are very happy with the success of these trials which mark a major step in the reinforcement of the French Navy's future capabilities. We have passed a significant milestone in terms of the complexity of the integration of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) on board a heavily armed vessel, both physically and operationally,” said Pierre-Eric Pommellet, CEO of Naval Group. “These trials have also shown the relevance of the Naval Group I4Drones® mission system, and the fact that the SDAM demonstrator can seamlessly be integrated on a vessel and will work harmoniously with other existing systems. In synergy with the ship’s combat system and the embarked helicopter, the drone will be another means to access complementary airspaces and will truly be a remote sensor that will expand the crew’s perception and treatment of threats in real time.”



The derisking study for the SDAM programme was awarded to Airbus Helicopters and Naval Group by the DGA. The objective is to design, produce and test a rotary wing unmanned aerial system demonstrator for the French Navy. The system works with the Airbus Helicopters VSR700 unmanned aerial system and the I4Drones® mission system developed by Naval Group. Naval Group has also been tasked with the integration of the system onboard military vessels. The project also involves French SMEs like Hélicoptères Guimbal and Diades, contributing to the creation of a local naval UAS industry in France.

easyJet signs up to Airbus' pioneering carbon removal solution - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1lYXN5amV0LXNpZ25zLXVwLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1waW9uZWVyaW5nLWNhcmJvbi1yZW1vdmFsLXNvbHV0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse – easyJet has become the first airline in the world to sign a contract with Airbus for its carbon-removal initiative. Available through the Airbus Carbon Capture Offer, the technology uses Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), to offer airlines worldwide carbon removal credits to advance their decarbonisation goals.

DACCS technology filters and removes CO2 emissions directly from the air using high powered extraction fans. Once removed from the air, the CO2 is safely and permanently stored in underground reservoirs. CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere during aircraft operations cannot be directly eliminated at source but with DACCS, an equivalent amount can be extracted from the air. The technology is complementary to other carbon reduction technologies such as the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Thomas Haagensen, Group Markets Director at easyJet, said: “Decarbonising a hard to abate sector, such as aviation, is a huge challenge and we believe carbon removal will play an important role in addressing our residual emissions in the future, complementing other components to help us achieve our pathway to net zero. Our ultimate aim is to achieve zero carbon emission flying and, as well as investing into important projects like direct air carbon capture technology, we are working with multiple partners – including Airbus – to accelerate the development of zero carbon emission aircraft technology.”

Julie Kitcher, Executive Vice President Communications, Sustainability & Corporate Affairs at Airbus, said: “easyJet is a strong advocate of decarbonisation, for its operations and the wider aviation sector. This agreement demonstrates the airline’s willingness to extend its environmental commitment through Airbus’ Carbon Capture Offer. Initiatives such as this one underline Airbus’ commitment to decarbonisation solutions for our industry and to, bringing together airlines and industry players from all sectors in order to build a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

easyJet was amongst the first airlines to sign an agreement with Airbus in 2022, commiting to engage in negotiations on the possible pre-purchase of verified and durable carbon removal credits. easyJet’s credits will last from 2026 to 2029. The carbon removal credits will be issued by Airbus’ partner 1PointFive. Airbus’ agreement with 1PointFive includes the pre-purchase of 400,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits to be delivered over four years.

The A321XLR demonstrates passenger comfort and cabin maturity - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXRoZS1hMzIxeGxyLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlcy1wYXNzZW5nZXItY29tZm9ydC1hbmQtY2FiaW4tbWF0dXJpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a major step en route to certification. On the 5th of October an A321XLR test aircraft performed its passenger experience flight in typical airline operating conditions. On board, 200 Airbus employees were among the first to experience the comfort of the A321XLR in simulated real service conditions before its entry into service in 2024.

On Thursday 5 October, the A321XLR successfully completed its ‘early passenger flight’ demonstration with 167 employees acting as passengers. There were also 22 experts and 11 Airbus Flight Test and cabin crew members on board.

Test aircraft MSN11080 took off from Toulouse at 11:14 am and landed at 5:26 pm, after a six hour 12 minutes flight around Europe. The A321XLR was powered with 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, demonstrating action towards achieving the sector’s emissions reduction goals including in Airbus flight test activities. All Airbus aircraft today are already certified to fly with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel on board.

By gauging passengers' perception of cabin comfort, the passenger flight represents an important contribution to the A321XLR’s verification and validation, ensuring full maturity at entry into service for customers in 2024. The flight also enables Airbus to refine the cabin procedures and assess the cabin environment and systems while the aircraft is in the air.

Airbus employees acting as passengers

During the flight, the passengers were invited to answer a survey about the visual aspects of the cabin, as well as temperature and noise levels. They were asked to test out various cabin systems, including the air conditioning, lighting, galleys, electrics, washrooms and water waste systems, according to Pete Housley, Product Delivery Team Testing leader. Ergonomic aspects were also assessed, such as how easy or hard it is to load and unload the new overhead bins.

In addition to the perception survey, the 22 experts on board took the opportunity to take direct ‘spot’ measurements of acoustic levels and cabin temperature. Crew noise exposure was recorded, especially around the area of the main entrance door. The new Airspace cabin elements were also tested for any vibrations or resonance during different flight phases. “It will be interesting to compare the technical data we captured during the flight with human perception of these parameters,” explains Hans-Gerhard Giesa, Human Factors senior expert in the cabin & cargo team in Hamburg, Germany. “I hope all the measurements will give us good results and now we have a lot of data to analyse to see if the systems are working as expected.”

Voice of passengers

The 167 Airbus employees on board are involved in the A321XLR programme in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. They included Blanca Martinez Gallar, Aerodynamics Engineer in Getafe, Spain, who shared her emotion at being there: “When I learnt that I was going to be selected to be on this flight, I was very happy, and quite proud to be one of the first A321XLR passengers and one of the people out of all the Airbus departments of Aerodynamics to be selected. I worked hard on this aircraft last year, participating in both high speed and low speed performance flight test campaigns for both the CFM and Pratt & Whitney engines, so it’s quite an emotion to fly the A321XLR. As a passenger, I would say the A321XLR is a very comfortable and very quiet aircraft. It was also my first flight in business class, so I was really impressed. I really enjoyed this moment.”

Hailing from Airbus Atlantic in Montoir de Bretagne, France, Nicolas Moyon, Mechanics operator was also one of the selected passengers: “I was excited to be on board, as I missed my chance to attend the A321XLR first flight last year. I felt grateful to have this second chance. I really appreciated the diversity of the Airbus team on board, working in different functions and locations, be they engineers, operators or support functions. Wherever we are, we are all very proud to contribute to this new-born aircraft.”

“We had a really great time,"" says Jim Fawcett, the Lead Flight Test Engineer who has taken part in the A321XLR’s entire route proving campaign. “It's always interesting to share these moments with our colleagues and to learn more about their job. It’s also a great opportunity for us to show how we are working. I think a lot of our colleagues discovered what it is like to be on a test flight, so it’s a very good experience for all of us.”

With this new flight test, the A321XLR’s intensive certification testing is progressing towards the goal of reaching Type Certification followed by entry into service in 2024.

The A321XLR is the next step in the evolution of the single-aisle A320neo Family, meeting market demand for increased range and payload on longer routes. The A321XLR will deliver an unprecedented range for single-aisle aircraft, of up to 4,700nm (8,700 km), with 30% lower fuel consumption per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft as well as reduced NOx emissions and noise.

To date, the A320neo Family has accumulated more than 9,700 orders from over 130 customers worldwide. A321XLR orders stand at more than 500 from over 20 customers."

"Aeolus' assisted reentry, a successful experiment to reduce space debris - Airbus","Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLWFlb2x1cy1hc3Npc3RlZC1yZWVudHJ5LWEtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1leHBlcmltZW50LXRvLXJlZHVjZS1zcGFjZS1kZWJyaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 28 July 2023 Aeolus, a meteorological satellite built by Airbus and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), bid its farewell, burning up as it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. Well-known for its pioneering monitoring of wind conditions on a global scale, helping climatologists improve weather forecasts and climate models over the past five years, Aeolus will also enter the history books as the first assisted satellite reentry, initiated by Airbus.

The idea began to take shape in 2021 among the Airbus teams overseeing Aeolus operations. Defining and putting in place a re-entry procedure that had never been tried before was a challenge, and one that ESA accepted and implemented.

A challenging safe reentry requiring innovation

To make the shift from uncontrolled to assisted reentry, the Airbus team had to factor in multiple limitations linked to the satellite’s design and mission.

For several years, the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) has recommended designing spacecraft in such a way that they are as demisable* as possible, to minimise the number of remaining fragments that might cause damage on the ground. “As the design was decided before current regulation came into effect, it was not possible to minimise the number and size of remaining fragments that might cause damage on the ground as the spacecraft was already in orbit,” explains Airbus space debris focal point Frédéric Payot.

Defining an alternative trajectory

Developed at the beginning of the 2000s with a low-risk but nevertheless uncontrolled reentry plan, Aeolus would have fallen naturally back to Earth within a few months. However, with no possibility to steer the satellite to a selected area, it could have landed anywhere.

The initial strategy assessed the possibility to perform controlled reentry for Aeolus to confine the debris footprint on the ground. Unfortunately, the thrusters could not produce enough force to target a reentry in the South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area (SPOUA), designated by the UN for deorbited space systems splashdown.

“We had to come up with an alternative,” says Payot. “We needed to identify a strategy in between controlled and uncontrolled reentry, taking maximum benefit from satellite capabilities. The polar orbit of Aeolus offers the possibility to target some ground tracks with little landmass and very few inhabitants. In particular, a corridor in the Atlantic Ocean was selected to guarantee safe entry into the atmosphere”.

Essential engineering skills

To effectively manage Aeolus’ return to Earth, Airbus’ UK and Toulouse teams made use of specific engineering skills. “Our flight dynamics experts calculated the orbital trajectory of the spacecraft down to low altitude and in an atmosphere with significant density,” Payot explains. “On top of that, we had to ensure the satellite was still able to fly at very low altitude (150 km), while keeping all the forces acting on it in check.”

Atmospheric modelling was key to estimating drag and its impact on Aeolus’ trajectory when controlling the satellite’s altitude and orbit. “We made trajectory predictions based on the natural drift of the satellite, and we had to take the Sun into account, too,” Payot says. Solar activity has a huge impact on the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Indeed, drag increases with solar activity, which impacts altitude and reentry date.

“Preparing the reentry well in advance was paramount,” Payot concludes. “We couldn’t have put this cutting-edge strategy in place in six months; it took nearly two years to prepare for these end of life operations. Defining a new targeted entry area and operating a satellite outside of its original flight domain was a huge challenge requiring a lot of preparation and anticipation.”

Reducing space debris as a target

According to ESA’s Space Environment Report, in 2023 more than 30,000 trackable objects (>10 cm) are located in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of less than 2,000 km. One way to limit debris pollution in space is to remove spacecraft from their orbit.

Aeolus’ successful reentry not only celebrates the ingenuity and knowledge of Airbus’ engineers; it also highlights the importance of innovation to find solutions to mitigate space debris. Airbus renewed its commitment with ESA with the Zero Debris Charter in June 2023, a further step towards achieving global leadership in space debris mitigation and remediation.

* The Design for Demise approach proposes design alternatives which improve the disintegration and ablation of the spacecraft during the reentry in the atmosphere (e.g change the material or the shape of the spacecraft.)"

Airbus and Northrop Grumman sign strategic partnership in UK military satellite communications bid - Airbus,"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1zaWduLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1pbi11ay1taWxpdGFyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London, 23 October 2023 - Airbus and United States-headquartered defence prime Northrop Grumman announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop and foster a strategic partnership in military satellite communications for the UK’s future wideband SKYNET military satellite communications programme.



The agreement between the two leading European and United States-based defence and space firms will bring together the latest technology and will see the two companies' experience, knowledge, and capability mutually shared to address military satellite communication requirements for the British Ministry of Defence.

Airbus and Northrop Grumman say the partnership is vitally important as military forces increasingly use space-based assets to fulfil their missions and require specialised technology to transmit information via space. The two companies will be teaming up to offer customers the very latest military satellite communication technologies for users and ensure they are always connected and able to process the increasing amount of data collected and disseminated on the ground, in the air, at sea and in orbit.

Airbus Defence and Space, the largest aeronautics, space, and defence company in Europe, is a proven and trusted partner to the UK and its Allies, and has a successful history of delivering cutting-edge space technologies on time and to budget. Northrop Grumman - the world's largest space company - has put innovative products and ideas into orbit, on the Moon and beyond.

Ben Bridge, UK Chairman of Airbus Defence and Space, said: “Partnering with Northrop Grumman will enable us to address the evolving requirements of Britain's military satellite communications' needs, and we believe our joint expertise offers the very best capabilities for the UK, now and in the future.

He added: “This transatlantic collaboration builds on the strong Airbus and Northrop Grumman relationship and further unites UK, European and American interests in space.”

The team will provide our customers with innovative, reliable and affordable military satellite communications technology to meet the rapidly evolving requirements of today’s environment.”"
Airbus is pioneering a robust robotics strategy to sustain aircraft deliveries - Airbus,"Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXBpb25lZXJpbmctYS1yb2J1c3Qtcm9ib3RpY3Mtc3RyYXRlZ3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Robots will play an integral role in the future of aircraft manufacturing. The Airbus robotics strategy aims to future-proof operations by internalising key areas of expertise and accelerating the development and deployment of internal robotics solutions.

In light of consistent growth and an unprecedented number of commercial aircraft orders, Airbus is already developing the technology that the factory of tomorrow will require. One cornerstone of this future is robots, whose increasing prevalence will allow operators to concentrate on value-added tasks and contribute to containing production costs and increasing quality standards.

To accelerate and sustain aircraft deliveries, Airbus is thus investing in a robotics and automation strategy that will strengthen the central role of robotics in our manufacturing processes. “Airbus is taking a leading role in the design, development and integration of robotics technologies that are customised to our manufacturing needs,” explains Fabien Bardinet, Head of Robotics. “By innovating new aerospace-centric solutions and bringing the robotics supply chain in-house through strategic acquisitions, we are contributing to the success of the ramp-up and building the industrial system of tomorrow.”

Bringing robot lifecycle expertise in-house

For several years, Airbus has been working to identify and acquire key players in the aerospace robotics field. In 2019, Airbus purchased Seattle-area MTM Robotics, now part of the Airbus Robotics community. The company designs and deploys robotic automation and software systems for aerospace manufacturing. Notably, they developed the Flextrack, a drilling robot primarily used on A320 Family fuselage pre-assembly lines at Airbus.

“We have about 50 Flextracks in production areas today,” says Giovanni Loiacono, Head of Robotics and Automation Integration. “All existing and new single-aisle pre-assembly lines will be progressively equipped with Flextracks. We will also increase their use on the final assembly lines.” Considering the strategic importance of the Flextrack, acquiring MTM Robotics was a logical step in securing Airbus’ long term robotics strategy. But as the company’s operations remained headquartered on the west coast of the United States, Airbus needed a Europe-based supplier to manage the local installation, maintenance and servicing of the Flextrack.

Sobotech, a Toulouse-based robotics company, fit the bill. After several years of working together, Airbus finalised the purchase of Sobotech in October 2023. “With this acquisition, Airbus will now boast internal experts at every stage of the robot value chain, from design and development to integration and maintenance,” enthuses Loiacono.

This expansion will bring many benefits to Airbus and further secure operations. “The integration of highly talented robotics fellows into our workforce is key to securing the development of solutions that are fully adapted to our needs,” explains Bardinet. “We also strengthen our robot maintenance capabilities, a key support skill which will be at the core of our ability to support the production ramp-up and develop the industrial systems of the future.”

Leading the push for aerospace specialised robotics

Another goal of the Airbus robotics strategy is to increasingly develop, integrate and maintain our own customised robotics solutions, adapted to our exact needs. A significant milestone was recently reached when the custom-designed Medium Sized Drilling Robot (MSDR) reached maturity. It is now on its way to being integrated into the A320 Family pre-assembly line.

Designed by a small team of only six engineers, the MSDR is three times smaller than its predecessors. “Reducing the robot’s size was necessary to integrate it into existing assembly lines,” says Damien Van Damme, Robotic Expert in manufacturing engineering. “The current robots are so large that it isn’t possible! We would need to build new lines just to house them, and in the context of the ramp-up, that isn’t feasible.”

The MSDR team also designed innovative software and new hardware to prevent slippage during drilling, improving quality and overall equipment efficiency. “These innovations ensure that each hole is always drilled in the correct place and is perfectly perpendicular to the skin of the aircraft,” explains Van Damme. Designed entirely in-house, the MSDR also achieved significant cost savings compared to procured solutions.

MSDR represents a new generation of robots at Airbus that are custom designed by internal experts for the exact environment in which they will operate. Precision design and engineering, as seen with the MSDR, add value to manufacturing processes by reducing costs and stoppages, all while improving quality and saving time.

Creating new opportunities for operators

It is evident that robots have extensive potential for streamlining aerospace manufacturing. But their future positioning at the centre of the industrial system is also an opportunity to improve the lives of operators. “The Airbus robotics strategy aims to identify the most repetitive and uncomfortable tasks during the manufacturing process in order to determine where it makes the most sense to integrate robots,” says Bardinet. The goal is to increasingly spare workers from performing these tasks and enable them to concentrate on the kinds of value-added tasks that are best performed by humans.



“People worry that robots will replace their jobs, but they should see robots as an opportunity for job transformation instead of a threat,” Loiacono says. “Many operators who were previously responsible for drilling now have roles managing the robots. There are many tasks that need to be done to ensure the correct performance of the robots, and these jobs are safer and more ergonomically comfortable than drilling.”

“By innovating new aerospace-centric solutions and bringing the robotics supply chain in-house through strategic acquisitions, we substantially contribute to the success of the ramp-up.”

Safety Beyond Standard - Airbus,"Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXNhZmV0eS1iZXlvbmQtc3RhbmRhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By taking advantage of the most innovative technology developed for the latest aircraft families like the Airbus A350, and applying that technology to all commercial aircraft in the range, Airbus is going above and beyond regulatory requirements to enhance safety. Called “Safety Beyond Standard,” this initiative marks the latest step in our continuous improvement approach to safety.

One of the initiative’s current objectives is to raise other Airbus fly-by-wire family aircraft to the latest technology level in terms of operational capability, assistance to flight crews, and resilience capability of the aircraft against abnormal conditions.

The Safety Beyond Standard strategy will notably help in mitigating the major safety risks (Loss of control in-flight (LOC-I), Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) & Runway excursion (RE)).

For example, to mitigate the risk of Loss of control in-flight, these safety design enhancements developed for the fly-by-wire fleet are the following:

Enhanced autopilot 1 , flight directors 2 and autothrust 3 availability:

Pilots rely on the autopilot, because this is a system which is key to reduce workload for pilots. If the autopilot is managing the direction and keeps the aircraft at a given altitude, the crew has the mental capacity to focus on other tasks while handling an abnormal situation. But the autopilot system has its limits. In case of sensor failure it hands back the control of the aircraft to the pilots. The A350 was the first Airbus aircraft to introduce an autopilot which could compensate for system and sensor failures and remain in control. Since 2020, Airbus is progressively upgrading the A320 and A330 fly-by-wire systems to this capability.

Enhanced flight envelope protection availability:

Flight envelope protection is a standard feature on modern fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. It is in use by all major manufacturers worldwide. In a very simplified way, the system is much similar to an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) or traction control system on a car. The aircraft’s flight envelope corresponds to the various critical operational limits, beyond which its controllability and the structural integrity may be at risk (low or high airspeeds, maximum aerodynamic lift & angle-of-attack, flight attitudes, etc.). The purpose of flight envelope protections is to allow the best aircraft performance and control authority while minimising the risk of over-controlling, losing control, overstressing, or damaging the aircraft. In case of a malfunction, the flight envelope protection degrades following a predefined sequence - going from the so-called “normal law” to “alternate law”. The pilot then manually has to keep in mind the limits of the aircraft and avoid overstress or overspeed. Since 2020, the latest safety technology enhancements have been brought to all members of the fly-by-wire family, with more alerts and protections available even in alternate law.

Enhanced flight crew interface:

Anemometric data is key to indicate the speed of the aircraft versus the ambient air. But there are other sources which could be used as well as a reference in case the anemometric data is lost. The so-called digital Back Up Speed system (link opens external video) is an example of how the airspeed could be calculated by using the Angle of Attack sensors, weight and load factor. Available on all Airbus aircraft since 2021, this provides the crew with basic information on airspeed when using nominal sensors is not possible anymore.

Safety Beyond Standard aims at developing incremental safety bricks not only for new aircraft but providing a retrofittable solution for the existing fleet.

1 Autopilot = the guidance (e.g. altitude/heading) is made automatically through the flight controls

These new overhead aircraft bins could be an inflight game-changer - CNN,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FpcmJ1cy1vdmVyaGVhZC1haXJzcGFjZS1sLWJpbnMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

In today’s not-so-golden era of domestic air travel, checking a suitcase for free is a luxury afforded to few. And those who do check their bags often find themselves stressing out the whole journey, wondering if their luggage is actually going to arrive at their destination with them.

As a result, more travelers than ever are opting to cram their belongings into a carry-on bag – many of them bulky, with wheels.

The result? A boarding free-for-all, as nervous flyers hover around the gate hoping to be among the first to get on the plane – all to secure a tiny piece of overhead real estate near their seat.

Unfortunately, the older versions of those highly coveted bins were not designed with your average carry-on roller suitcase in mind. They must be laid down flat, leaving a small space above them that is of little use, while taking up a good chunk of bin space.

Enter French aircraft maker Airbus and its new “Airspace L Bins,” designed to be retrofitted in three to five days.

First revealed in May, these specially shaped overhead compartments, promise to create 60% more cabin luggage space than traditional systems. How? Simply by allowing travelers to load their carry-on roller bags vertically instead of having to lay them flat. (See the above pic.)

The bins hold bags that are 61 centimeters (height) x 38 centimeters (width) x 25 centimeters (depth).

Made of ultra-lightweight composite products, the retrofit re-uses many parts of the original bin including the sidewall, ceiling and lighting to cut down on waste, says Airbus.

Flight attendants will likely approve of the new compartments too, knowing they can complete boarding procedures while hearing far fewer complaints from flyers about how they don’t have a place to stash their bags.

According to Airbus, the new Airspace L Bins were designed to be retrofitted in three to five days. Courtesy Airbus

One airline has already signed up. From early 2025, German flag carrier Lufthansa plans to begin retrofitting 38 A320 aircraft with the new Airspace L Bins, which are produced by Germany-based Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), a subsidiary of ST Engineering and Airbus.

“We know from talking with airline customers that bigger bins are a clear need to enhance the passenger experience,” said Airbus head of commercial services for Europe, Charbel Youzkatli, in a statement.

The complicated world of baggage

Luggage has long been a contentious and complicated issue in the aviation world, and, bigger bins or not, that doesn’t appear set to change.

Not everyone brings carry-on luggage just to dodge added checked baggage fees – many airlines charge extra if you want to bring a suitcase on the plane, too. As noted, some travelers just love the convenience of not having to wait for their suitcase at the carousel upon arrival.

It’s also a political issue. Just this week, European Union lawmakers reportedly voted to support a resolution that calls for airlines to stop charging passengers for “reasonable” sized carry-on luggage.

But baggage fees are undeniably a huge money maker for airlines. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, US airlines earned more than $6.7 billion in baggage fee revenue in 2022.

Some airlines justify the fees by pointing to the environmental impact – lighter aircraft are more fuel-efficient, so deterring people from bringing a lot of added weight with them is a good thing.

And supporters of fare “unbundling” say it all works out – those who want to pay for extras like checked bags can, the rest of us can enjoy cheaper fares.

In the end though, regardless of traveler preferences, most would agree that if better-designed bins can speed up the time we spend getting on and off the plane, we’re all for them."
"LATAM Airlines takes delivery of its first A321neo, adds 13 more to orderbook - Airbus","Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1sYXRhbS1haXJsaW5lcy10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1pdHMtZmlyc3QtYTMyMW5lby1hZGRzLTEzLW1vcmUtdG_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hamburg, 2 October 2023 – LATAM Airlines has taken delivery of its first A321neo leased from AerCap and placed an order for 13 additional A321neo aircraft to further expand its route network and drive its regional growth. This is the first delivery of a committed backlog of 76 A321neo aircraft. In total, LATAM has 111 A320 Family aircraft to be delivered.

The newly delivered A321neo for LATAM can seat up to 224 passengers and feature Airbus’ Airspace XL bins in the cabin. The larger bins provide a 40% increase in storage space and facilitates 60% more carry-on bags, allowing a more relaxed boarding experience for passengers and cabin crews. The newly delivered A321neo flew to its destination with 49% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“Our fleet renewal and modernization strategy is fully aligned with our sustainability commitment and brings us closer to the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral group by 2050,” said Ramiro Alfonsín, Chief Financial Officer of LATAM Airlines Group. “We will continue to work on enhancing the current fleet with next-generation aircraft to further improve our connectivity while caring for the environment.”

“We thank LATAM for their continued confidence in our aircraft, reselecting the A321neo for its continued network growth. This strategic move also accelerates LATAM decarbonisation trajectory as the A321neos are at least 20% more fuel-efficient, emitting 20% less CO2 and 50% less noise compared to previous generation aircraft,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling single-aisle A320 Family. The A321neo allows operators to cover the entire market, while offering the lowest seat-mile cost of any single-aisle available. To date, more than 5,200 A321neos have been ordered by customers worldwide.

LATAM Airlines Group and its affiliates are the main group of airlines in Latin America, with presence in five domestic markets in the region: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, in addition to international operations throughout Europe, Oceania, the United States and the Caribbean. Today, LATAM operates 240 Airbus aircraft and is the largest Airbus operator in Latin America. In July this year, LATAM took delivery of a new Airbus A320neo, the first delivery using 30% SAF.

Airbus has sold over 1,150 aircraft in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 750 are in operation throughout the region, with more than 520 in the order backlog, representing a market share of 58% of in-service passenger aircraft. Since 1994, Airbus has secured 75% of net orders in the region.

In 2016, Airbus became the first aircraft manufacturer to offer customers SAF at delivery flights. Today, aircraft and helicopters leave Airbus delivery centres with SAF onboard. SAF has been identified as one of the key elements in helping achieve emissions reduction goals.

Airbus Helicopters boosts competitiveness with 3D printing - Airbus,"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYm9vc3RzLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlbmVzcy13aXRoLTNkLXByaW50aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth - Airbus Helicopters has opened a new 3D printing centre at its Donauwörth site, significantly expanding its in-house capacity for this innovative process. Airbus Helicopters now operates three machines for components made of titanium, four for plastic parts and, as a new element, a machine that can produce components made of aluminium. The process, also known as additive manufacturing, offers several benefits compared to conventional manufacturing. It can be used for serial production as well as for components for prototypes such as the electrically powered CityAirbus NextGen and the experimental high-speed helicopter, Racer.

""Our extensive capabilities in this process along the manufacturing chain are a real competitive advantage,” said Stefan Thomé, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters in Germany. “Among other advantages, 3D printing can reduce the weight of aircraft components which leads to less fuel consumption. Such potential can bring financial benefits and contribute to reducing CO2 emissions during operations.”

Other advantages of 3D printing include a significant increase in resource efficiency in the manufacturing process and high flexibility. Components with new configurations can be printed as individual pieces or in small series for testing purposes. This also makes the process appealing for building prototypes. While conventional machining involves milling components out of solid blocks, additive layer printing uses laser beams to melt metal or plastic powders. In this way, the desired shapes are created layer by layer. This makes it easier to produce complex structures than with conventional methods. A conventional manufacturing process requires up to ten times more raw material than the final product, whereas additive manufacturing requires only 1.5 times as much.

Since 2017, Airbus Helicopters has mass-produced more than 9,400 locking shafts for the doors of the Airbus A350, using the additive process as part of the Donauwörth-based airplane door business. Eleven tonnes of titanium powder have been used in Donauwörth for printing the locking shafts.

However, the program focuses on more than aviation. It also provides students with hands on, STEAM based curriculums. That's science, tech, engineering, art, and math. Officials they say the program also makes learning about these topics fun.



""We call it our work room, not our classroom!"" says Melanie Kriner, a career tech educator at Semmes Middle School.

This is the first year that Semmes Middle School is participating in the ‘We Build It Better’ program a career tech program sponsored by Airbus and Flight Works Alabama that focuses on STEAM based lesson plans which help prepare students for the future.

""It not only looks at aviation, but we look at all kinds of industry skills,"" says Kriner.

Kriner says right now, students are learning about computer aided design through a project where they make their own backpack tags.

""They're going to be able to print their backpack tag out over here on our 3d printer in the classroom,"" says Kriner.

She says they also do other lessons that help make learning fun. The we build it better program has had over 40,000 participants in 16 states and in the United Kingdom. Now a new program is targeting an even younger population: elementary school student.

""We will build it better is an elementary curriculum that focuses on steam and career tech lessons for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade,” says Michelle Hurdle, President of Flight Works Alabama.

She says several elementary schools in Mobile and Baldwin County are some of the first in the nation to integrate this new program. The program was developed by Flight Works Alabama, Airbus, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Snap-on Tools, and the Thompson Engineering Foundation.

""You know when children go to school and learn about firefighters, they learn about veterinarians. This is a time where they can also learn about other careers in their community,” says Hurdle.” And we want them to be involved in steam and know that it's something they can do. It's not beyond them to learn how to code computers or code robots or how to build things with hand tools.""

In a current shortage of STEAM professionals, this program couldn't come at a better time.

""What we're most excited about is- yes we know that they're going to use mallets and hammers and screwdrivers in this program and in the middle school program, but we're seeing the soft skills development and that's what we're most excited about for our future work force,"" says Hurdle.

""We're living in the 21st century. We're in a global environment and these students have to know these types of skills if they want to be competitive, not only in our country but in the world,"" says Kriner.

Although the program just launched this month, they anticipate 77 schools in more than 7 states to be a part of it by the end of the year."
Airbus and Louis Dreyfus Will Build Low Emission Dual-Fuel and Wind Ro-Ros - The Maritime Executive,"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtbG91aXMtZHJleWZ1cy13aWxsLWJ1aWxkLWxvdy1lbWlzc2lvbi1kdWFsLWZ1ZWwtYW5kLXdpbmQtcm8tcm9z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aviation company Airbus working with French shipping company Louis Dreyfus Armateurs plans to replace its existing fleet of ro-ro cargo ships with three new fuel-efficient vessels to transport aircraft components across the Atlantic. They highlight that the effort which includes the use of rotors and dual-fuel e-methanol engines is part of an overall effort to lower the carbon emissions from their operations.

They are reported to be in negotiations with shipyards for an order to build three ro-ro cargo vessels that would incorporate the fuel saving and lower emissions technologies while also expanding Airbus’ shipping capacity. Registered in France, each of the vessels would have six Flettner rotors and two dual-fuel engines. The engines will run on marine diesel and e-methanol. They plan for the vessels to begin to enter service in 2026 and gradually phase out the company’s existing fleet.

Over time, they also expect to increase the percentage of e-methanol used by the ships. Currently, on ro-ro, the Ville de Bordeaux emits 41,000 tons of CO2 on an Atlantic crossing while the other vessel, the City of Hamburg, emits 27,000 tonnes. By 2030, the new vessels will emit 11,000 tonnes and as they increase the use of e-methanol it will fall to 5,000 each by 2040 for the three new ships.

Airbus’ goal is to reduce emissions from its Atlantic fleet by 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2023 baseline. The new fleet is projected to reduce average annual transatlantic CO2 emissions from 68,000 to 33,000 tones by 2030. It is part of Airbus’ commitment to reduce its overall industrial emissions by 63 percent by the end of the decade compared to 2015 as a baseline.

The aviation company has already begun several steps aimed at reducing emissions. The ro-ro Ville de Bordeaux began testing a kite-like technology in 2022 and recently plans were announced to add suction wing sails to the vessel. Airbus has also introduced the use of sustainable aviation fuel and its road operations use biogas when possible.

Today, Airbus has three charted vessels operating on two routes carrying containers as well as subassemblies ranging from wings, fuselage, horizontal and vertical tail components, and engine pylons. On the Mediterranean, the Ciudad de Cadiz (3,500 dwt built in 2009) makes stops at Airbus and supplier production facilities in Tunis, Naples, Porto, and Saint-Nazaire. The Ville de Bordeaux (5,200 dwt built in 2004) and the City of Hamburg (3,500 dwt built in 2008) cross the Atlantic. Components are moved from Saint-Nazaire, France to the Airbus final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

As the fleet is gradually renewed, the Ciudad de Cadiz will be retired from service. When the first of the new Atlantic vessels enters service in 2026, the City of Hamburg will transfer to the Mediterranean. When the second new vessel is delivered, the Ville de Bordeaux will move to the Mediterranean to replace the City of Hamburg.

Airbus reports the renewal of the shipping fleet is also part of an effort to increase production of its A320 class of planes to 75 aircraft per month by 2026. The new vessels will have the capacity to transport around 70 40-foot containers and six aircraft subassembly sets. The Ville de Bordeaux currently transports four subassembly sets while the City of Hamburg only has space for three. The added capacity Airbus reports could also be used for other divisions or its partners.

Small town meets critical care with Klamath Falls' AirLink - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXNtYWxsLXRvd24tbWVldHMtY3JpdGljYWwtY2FyZS13aXRoLWtsYW1hdGgtZmFsbHMtYWlybGlua9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air ambulance provider, AirLink uses an H125 to carry out inter-facility transfers and scene calls for rural Klamath Falls, Oregon, linking small town life to large-scale care.

Surrounded by the Cascades, forests and swaths of farmland, Klamath Falls in eastern Oregon enjoys a lifestyle (outdoorsy, neighborly) and a landscape (cut off for weeks in winter weather) that forges strong bonds.

""We go on camping trips together, attend each other’s birthday parties. There’s that sense of community at work,” says Jason Askins, Regional Aviation Manager for AirLink Region 11.

Rural USA, a beauty and a beast



Warm in the summer (85° F), snow-covered until April, Klamath Falls is connected by a scenic highway to Bend, its nearest big neighbor to the north, where AirLink runs a second base. Between the two, you’ll find neither a fire reporting station, nor a Jet-A fuel depot—omissions that typify the area’s prized remoteness.

The trade-off for such rugged beauty? Medical limitations. When residents get ill or injured, Sky Lake Medical Center treats most cases. But not all. Some patients have to be sent to larger facilities either by ground or, depending on the circumstances, by air.

This is where AirLink, operated by MedTrans (a subsidiary of GMR), plays a vital role providing inter-facility transfers (IFT) and responding to scene calls with an H125 helicopter and a Pilatus PC-12. The Klamath Falls team consists of 25 pilots, nurses, respiratory therapists and mechanics. Flights in the H125 can run the gamut from transferring high-risk obstetrical cases to responding to farm accidents, drownings, or ski accidents.

No lack of care, however far



The majority of AirLink’s flights are IFT cases, and of these, many are cardiac or stroke patients. A scarcity of nearby medical facilities is another reason for transfers. “Places out east are limited in what they can do for a patient,” explains Todd Lemaire, AirLink Flight Respiratory Therapist. “For especially challenging cases, they have to transfer patients to a higher level of care.”

Beyond IFT cases, 30% of AirLink’s flights cover scene calls, often involving car crashes. Icy winter conditions, speeding and fatigue are common factors. Often, the crew has more to contend with than just timing. Avoiding thick smoke in the wildfire season, deviating to refuel late at night . . . it’s part of the job for Kyle Alford, Base Aviation Manager and an H125 pilot who, like his AirLink colleagues, puts safety at the forefront of his operations.

AirLink crew transporting a patient to an H125

Single and sturdy



AirLink’s H125 is licensed as an ambulance by the state of Oregon and to anyone who takes a look inside, it’s not surprising. Left of the pilot lies the patient with their head by the medical attendant. The back seat has cardiac and blood pressure monitors, a mechanical ventilator, and a suction machine. An IFT bag carries IV pumps, glucometer, and blood transfusion kit. They also fly with a Point of Care IStat to perform critically needed blood values like Chem 8 panel and ABG’s.

“The H125 has good patient access; I can get down to their waist and even their knees because of the way the LifePort system is designed,” says Todd Lemaire. “It’s easy to load into, I can see out the front window, and it’s got a nice width so you have a bit of room.”

Patient comfort and transport time are certainly another plus of getting a lift in the H125. Kyle Alford ticks off the one- or two-hours’ drive times to hospitals (Medford is an hour-and-a-half and Bend is closer to three hours) versus the time he takes to fly: 30 minutes to tiny Christmas Valley, an hour’s flight to St. Charles Hospital in Bend.

The helicopter’s performance at high altitudes and hot temperatures was a key reason for its place in the AirLink fleet, especially when flights take them over Crater Lake. Kyle Alford recalls landing at 7,300 feet in a tight spot. “With the way the motor and that tail rotor perform, it was like you weren’t even testing it,” he says. “Lifting off, we had to clear trees that were 100 feet tall. It didn’t even struggle.”

At night, the crew wears night vision goggles, an asset where dark skies reign. Daytime flights are VFR, albeit in occasional mist, rain or light snow. Here, the 2-axis autopilot takes some of the pressure. “We’re lucky to have the autopilot. I can make 180-degree turns more easily. It holds altitude. I can manage my heading,” says Alford.

The rugged life has its charms and perils but in Klamath Falls, medical care, luckily, ranks among the former.

As part of the deal, Airbus will upgrade France’s A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft to become communication nodes with command-and-control capabilities as part of their anticipated integration with the Future Combat Air System.

The first upgraded aircraft is expected to qualify for service with the French Air and Space Force in 2028.

“With this new capability of the aircraft, we are preparing the future by transforming the MRTT into an in-flight communications node, as the first building block of the multi-role tanker transport of tomorrow,” Jean-Brice Dumont, the head of military air systems at Airbus Defence and Space, said in the statement.

The so-called Standard 2 upgrade focuses on connectivity and self-protection capabilities, Airbus said. The company is to equip the aircraft with a satellite communications station supplied by fellow French firm Thales, with the aim of staying connected even in jammed environments and extreme weather conditions.

The upgrade will be a stepping stone toward the A330′s integration with the “future air combat cloud” within FCAS, according to Airbus. France and Germany launched the FCAS program in 2017, with Spain joining in 2020. The effort is meant to product cutting-edge aerospace technologies for the European nations.

The other contract includes in-service support for the A330 fleet for 10 years, with an option for two additional years, at the Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in southern France. Under the deal, Airbus will guarantee a level of availability as well as support for aircraft deployed outside France.

France has 12 operational A330s, and three more are on order. Other operators of the A330 include the U.K., Australia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Canada has nine of the aircraft on order, including five used airframes that will be converted by Airbus into strategic tankers.

Airbus says the A330 MRTT can carry up to 111 metric tons of fuel to service fighters, including the F-16, F-35 and Eurofighter, as well as large probe-equipped aircraft such as the A400M military transport plane.

Lockheed Martin has withdrawn its LMXT aerial refueler from the Air Force’s KC-135 fleet recapitalization program—previously referred to as the “bridge tanker” effort—the company said Oct. 23. However, its partner Airbus said it will press on, offering its Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) version of the aircraft.

A Lockheed spokesperson said the company will focus on the Next-Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) program instead.

“Lockheed Martin has decided not to respond to the U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 fleet recapitalization Request for Information (RFI),” a company spokesperson said.

“We are transitioning Lockheed Martin’s LMXT team and resources to new opportunities and priority programs, including development of aerial refueling solutions in support of” the NGAS program, the spokesperson added. “We remain committed to the accelerated delivery of advanced capabilities that strengthen the U.S. Air Force’s aerial refueling missions.”

An Airbus spokesperson said the company “remains committed to providing the U.S. Air Force and our warfighters with the most modern and capable tanker on the market, and will formally respond” to the KC-135 recapitalization request for information. “The A330 U.S.-MRTT is a reliable choice for the U.S. Air Force: one that will deliver affordability, proven performance and unmatched capabilities,” they added.

The Air Force released the RFI on Sept. 14, but the document is “controlled” and not available for public dissemination. Lockheed had almost six weeks to review the document before deciding not to pursue the program further but would only say through the spokesperson that “a combination of a few factors in the RFI shaped our decision, as well as acceleration of the NGAS program.”

The company said the details of its partnership with Airbus are proprietary and would not say whether Lockheed faces any financial obligations to Airbus as a result of its decision to end its part of the LMXT.

As to whether any elements of the LMXT which Lockheed brought to the partnership could find their way into Airbus’ proposal, the Lockheed spokesperson said “any future tanking opportunities between Lockheed Martin and Airbus will need to be considered based on specific requirements and timelines.”

The Air Force was not immediately prepared to provide comment on Lockheed’s decision. Service officials said as recently as August that there is not as yet an acquisition strategy for the KC-135 recap program or NGAS, as the Air Force analysis of alternatives for both programs was to begin after the RFI responses.

The KC-135 recapitalization is currently projected to be a program of about 75 aircraft—at roughly 15 per year—meeting the Air Force’s desire to keep some kind of traditional refueling aircraft in production between the end of Boeing’s KC-46 program—which wraps up with 179 aircraft circa 2028—and operational service of the yet-undefined NGAS, in the mid-2030s.

The NGAS is expected to be a smaller tanker able to operate alongside combat aircraft in contested airspace; Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has said the traditional approach of converting tube-and-wing-type freight aircraft into tankers will no longer be survivable in the late 2030s.

The service wants to preserve competition as much as possible, but Kendall has said that the cost of a competition—and a separate logistics train for a different aircraft—may not be worth it. Some members of Congress—particularly the Alabama delegation, where Lockheed would have assembled the LMXT—have objected to the idea of Boeing receiving a sole-source contract for more or modified versions of the KC-46.

Lockheed and Airbus’s LMXT proposal was based on the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), but with additional capabilities and features that would be unique to USAF. In June, Lockheed pitched the LMXT as a “mothership” for the NGAS fleet of smaller, stealthier tankers.

A European Aeronautic Defense and Space (EADS)-Northrop Grumman offering of an Airbus A330-based tanker was Boeing’s competition in several USAF tanker contests since the early 2000s, and was selected as the winner in 2008, receiving the designation KC-45. But that award was thrown out after a protest by Boeing, which won the re-compete with what is now called the KC-46. In that recompete, Northop left the KC-45 partnership—saying the rewritten contest rules favored Boeing’s entry—and Airbus entered on its own.

Lockheed’s campaign lead for the LMXT, Larry Gallogly, said in a June phone call with defense reporters that while 75 airplanes would have been a challenging business case for the aircraft, Lockheed expected the Air Force would need more time—and more tankers—because the Air Force’s NGAs timeline is a “very aggressive target.” He said 150 bridge tankers was more probable, and other company officials have said that a minimum of 110 aircraft was needed to close the business case.

Lockheed touted the LMXT as a hedge against a “single point failure” of the Air Force’s air refueling enterprise if Boeing’s KC-46 fleet was grounded. However, the LMXT, which is significantly larger than the KC-46, would be limited to a smaller number of airfields than the Boeing jet—a potentially problematic issue given the Air Force’s “Agile Combat Employment” model for operating from a widely dispersed number of airfields. Lockheed said the jet’s extra fuel capacity would enable it to operate from well outside contested airspace. The aircraft would also have had automatic air refueling capability; a feature the Air Force is eyeing for latter versions of the KC-46."
Airbus becomes member of “ACT FOR SKY” in Japan - Airbus,"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1iZWNvbWVzLW1lbWJlci1vZi1hY3QtZm9yLXNreS1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"#SAF #Sustainability #ACTFORSKY #Airbus

Tokyo, 2 October 2023 – Airbus has become a member of Japan’s “ACT FOR SKY,” a voluntary organisation that works to commercialise, promote, and expand the use of locally-produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Airbus will support ACT FOR SKY partners by providing technical information and cooperate on research and technology activities on SAF.

Airbus jointly performed the country’s first helicopter flight powered by SAF with local operator Nakanihon Air at Nagoya Airport in mid 2022. Building on this effort, Airbus has also been using domestically-produced SAF for helicopter test flights conducted at Airbus Helicopters Japan’s Kobe Airport Facility.

Airbus will also transport helicopters or larger aircraft parts using Airbus Beluga aircraft powered with SAF. By entering ACT FOR SKY, Airbus intends to support the establishment of a resilient Japanese supply chain for SAF.

“We are delighted to have joined ACT FOR SKY. At Airbus we are committed to supporting SAF as a major lever in the reduction of CO2 emissions as part of the aviation industry decarbonisation roadmap to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050,"" said Stéphane Ginoux, Senior Vice President, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan.

“All Airbus aircraft, including military aircraft and helicopters, can already fly with a 50% SAF blend. We aim to make our entire product portfolio capable of flying with 100% SAF by 2030, acting as a catalyst to ready the ecosystem for a 10% global uptake by 2030.”

ACT FOR SKY with “ACT” representing the cooperation and collaboration by major Japanese companies committed to take “action” for goals – aims to raise awareness among citizens and companies of the importance of SAF, carbon neutrality and achieving a circular economy. Initially established by 16 Japanese companies in March 2022, ACT FOR SKY now consists of 31 companies including Airbus. To know more about ACT FOR SKY, visit https://actforsky.jp"

The metal 3D printers, provided by Trumpf, will be used to manufacture aircraft components for both Airbus Helicopters and its parent company, Airbus.

""With innovative manufacturing processes, we are working on the helicopters of the future in Donauwörth. Among other things, 3D printing helps reduce the weight of components,"" says Helmut Färber, site manager of Airbus Helicopters in Donauwörth.

According to the company, the lighter weight components will reduce fuel consumption, lower costs, and reduce CO2 emissions in flight. Airbus Helicopters will use the 3D printing process to produce components for the electric-powered CityAirbus, the experimental high-speed Racer helicopter, and the Airbus A350 and A320 passenger aircraft.

""With its manufacturing know-how, Trumpf is a reliable partner to the aviation industry worldwide. Our 3D printing systems are a key technology on the path to sustainable flying and reduced dependency on long supply chains,"" says Richard Bannmueller, CEO of Trumpf Laser and System Technology.

Trumpf says AM allows entire assemblies to be printed as one stable component while meeting the strict safety requirements of the aviation industry. The structural components are made of titanium and high-strength aluminum.

""Additive manufacturing saves expensive raw material and can lower production costs in the aviation industry. 3D printers only use the material that designers actually need for their components and that ends up taking off in the aircraft,"" says Bannmueller."
Ground-breaking ceremony in Wunstorf - Airbus,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMC1ncm91bmQtYnJlYWtpbmctY2VyZW1vbnktaW4td3Vuc3RvcmbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wunstorf, 9 October 2023 - Airbus has officially launched the construction of the new A400M maintenance centre in Wunstorf. The traditional groundbreaking ceremony on the site at Wunstorf Air Base, the base for the German Air Force's A400M military transport aircraft, was held by Airbus Defence and Space CEO Michael Schöllhorn together with high-ranking representatives from politics and the German Armed Forces. Among them were Parliamentary State Secretary to the Minister of Defence Siemtje Möller, Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil, Germany’s Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz and Vice President of the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) Ralph Herzog. At the new maintenance centre, around 300 employees will service and maintain A400M aircraft from mid-2027.

""The A400M has been in reliable service for the German Armed Forces for over ten years. To keep it that way, the new Airbus A400M Maintenance Center Wunstorf is an important step forward: here, we will deepen the cooperation with the German Armed Forces and further improve the availability and operational capability of the A400M. The new maintenance centre will sustainably strengthen the successful cooperation between industry and the German Air Force,"" said Mike Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

""Airbus' decision to establish the new maintenance center in Wunstorf is farsighted and correct. Its proximity to the air base and also to Hannover airport will ensure smooth maintenance and operational readiness of the important A400M aircraft. This project marks an important step in securing transport capacities for the security of our country and for aid transports to disaster areas,"" said Stephan Weil, Minister President of Lower Saxony.

""The A400M is an indispensable part of the Air Force - whether as a transporter, tanker or in its role as MedEvac. With the A400M, we are supporting Bundeswehr missions and NATO air forces on the eastern flank. Evacuation missions from Kabul or Sudan would not have been feasible without the A400M. Similarly, we use the A400M to provide emergency aid in the event of natural disasters, as recently in Turkey and Libya. Worldwide operational readiness with our A400M fleet - that is only possible together with Airbus,"" said Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz, Chief of the German Air Force.

300 new jobs, increase in personnel from 2025 onwards

The A400M maintenance centre is being built right next to the air base of Air Transport Squadron 62 (LTG 62) in Wunstorf. The costs for the centre are in the low three-digit million range. Airbus will create 300 new jobs at the A400M maintenance centre in Wunstorf. The search is mainly for aeronautical engineering personnel. According to current planning and depending on the progress of construction, the increase in personnel is to begin gradually from 2025.

Completion planned for 2026, entry-into-service from mid-2027 onwards

Currently, about 20 employees of the construction companies are on site; during peak construction periods, more than 500 employees may be working there. Completion of the A400M maintenance centre is scheduled for the end of 2026. Entry-into-service is scheduled for mid-2027 after approval by the German Armed Forces Airworthiness Office.

Airbus Helicopters' Rotor Magazine discovers: ‘What will it test that couldn’t be done on the existing FlightLab or DisruptiveLab?‘

“This is a good question!” according to Dominik Strobel, Programme Lead for PioneerLab. “Of course, from a technology side, we can test anything. However, it helps if we utilise the idea of a testing pyramid. You start with the fundamental demonstration tests on the ground. At the peak of the pyramid, however, you have to bring it to a platform, and you simply cannot test everything on a single-engine helicopter if it is ultimately meant for a twin-engine helicopter. They have different requirements, sizes, you have to integrate things in a different way and the systems are different. There are many reasons why the twin-engine PioneerLab makes sense.”

What’s in the test?

The PioneerLab will test new technology in three areas: emission reduction, autonomy and sustainable materials and Strobel is keen to point out that it will not simply be testing existing technology for a larger platform. “If we look at the RSAS system, it is an enhanced system on what we have previously done – the requirements are different and therefore we will scale up on what we already have on the RSAS system. The goal is to improve the existing technologies to make them valuable for the targeted platform. On the other side, there are technologies like the automated take-off and landing (ATOL) and there is a need for this on twin-engines due to the higher integration of the systems and functions. Using a lot of different technologies, we are preparing how to integrate an easy method of doing a fully automated take-off and landing into the helicopter.”

Emission reduction is a target not without its challenges, as Strobel explains: “Our aerodynamics are already quite advanced, so it’s difficult to make advances there but improvements to the airframe and empennage are possible.” The research does have one highly significant goal though, “we are looking for the next possible evolutions and especially at hybridisation. We are hoping to bring the engine to a more efficient point, throughout the whole flight, with an e-motor taking over spikes and inefficient areas of flight, which will lead to an emission reduction.” The third area of interest is in terms of testing materials that are more sustainable. “Bio-based items will be introduced which will enable us to recycle parts of the aircraft”, notes Strobel.

Shared success thanks to the German ‘Lab’

This is also the first flying laboratory to be based in Donauwörth, Airbus Helicopters' German site and with reducing emissions a priority for the country, the government is supporting the PioneerLab’s research, with projects partly co-funded by the country’s Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, via LuFo. To Strobel it makes perfect sense to situate the PioneerLab at the Donauwörth site but he is keen to stress that its research will benefit the entire company. “The heart of the light twin-engine helicopters is in Germany so it makes sense to locate it here but we have a lot of support from across the business and our ambition is to have an open, transparent project. The technologies we are researching and our findings will bring value and knowledge to every programme.” Indeed Strobel states that programmes integrating the research into tangible innovations is a key indicator of success. For Strobel, hybridisation will also be an important measure “though the timeframe is much longer, my ambition is to see it become part of the fleet in some form or another.”

Joe Anselmo:

Welcome to this week's Check 6 podcast. I'm Joe Anselmo, Aviation Week's Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief of Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.

A listener to this podcast recently commented that we talk about Boeing a good bit more than we do about Airbus. There's no mystery to that. Airbus, in some respects, is on top of the world. It has a commanding lead over Boeing and the narrowbody market that could go on for years, while reinforcing its position in the large Chinese market with a second assembly line.

But not everything is perfect in Toulouse. Hampered by supply chain problems, Airbus badly missed its delivery projections last year, disappointing investors. And problems with Pratt and Whitney's Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine are forcing the temporary grounding of hundreds of A320neos and A220s in the coming months. That has set up a tug of war with some of its airline customers over the limited supply of new GTFs.

Last week, the company announced the promotion of longtime veteran Christian Scherer to run its commercial aircraft business. Airbus says the move will allow CEO Guillaume Faury to focus on strategy and the company's defense business. But moving commercial aircraft out from under the CEO is also a major shift in Airbus's corporate setup.

So what does it all mean? Here to help us read the tea leaves are: Jens Flottau, Aviation Week's Executive Editor for Commercial Aviation, who has just spent two days with industry insiders at the ISTAT conference in London. Tony Osborne is Aviation Week's European Military Editor and has covered Airbus's military business for us for more than a dozen years. Joining Jens and Tony is special guest Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners in London. Jens, let's kick off with you. How is the industry responding to this executive realignment at Airbus?

Jens Flottau:

Very positively. As you just indicated, I spent two days with some of their most important customers, the lessors, discussing this and the feedback that I got was very, very positive. They felt that Airbus needed more focus on commercial aircraft, not in the strategic sense, but in the operational sense, getting production up to the levels that Airbus and the customers want it to be. Sorting out the delays that have hampered deliveries for a long time now and continue to do so. And they think that Scherer is very, very customer focused. He's been heading sales, he's been heading strategy where he was deputy to John Leahy for a long time. So he's very well regarded on the customer side and the hope they have is that he will bring that focus into the rest of the Airbus commercial business as well and over time lead to improvements. It won't be something that he can achieve overnight of course, but clearly the message has been perceived as a very positive move.

Joe Anselmo:

Sash Tusa, welcome. Thanks for joining us. Why make this change now? Is this a case of Airbus declaring victory over COVID? We're resetting and moving forward. Or is it a case of investors maybe not being so happy with the company's operational performance in the last year and looking for Mr. Scherer to shape things up?

Sash Tusa:

I don't think it's that investors have been unhappy with Airbus’ performance in the last year, although clearly the end of 2022 when Airbus really did miss a good slug of deliveries was a disappointment, and the company recognizes that. I think much more, what we're looking at here as governance issue. If the CEO of the whole group, Guillaume Faury, is also CEO of the largest division, Airbus Commercial Aircraft, that's not terribly good governance.

And really it does mean that he isn't spending enough time looking at the overall group structure. He isn't spending enough time looking at the challenges in really what are three separate businesses, a defense business, a space business, and a helicopters business. But there is an element, I think you're right, I think victory over COVID might be a bit bombastic, but certainly the crisis of COVID is over. The business is normalizing, the challenge now is less one of recovery from a really low production rate and much more, how quickly, how smoothly and frankly from the point of view of customers, how credibly can Airbus get the production rate up to, in the case of the totemic A320neo, rate 75 by 2026.

That's a big ask and it's probably much better that a CEO of Airbus commercial aircraft does that, rather than the CEO of the whole of Airbus focusing on that number and perhaps missing quite a lot of what else he really should be doing.

Joe Anselmo:

So what are the biggest challenges that Mr. Scherer faces?

Sash Tusa:

In the short to medium term, it is the production rate, but specifically it's managing the whole Geared Turbofan crisis. We heard back in June that there was going to be a recall of some Geared Turbofans and we heard last month that it was way worse than anybody had expected, and it will probably continue to get worse. So Airbus is going to be competing for the very same Geared Turbofan engines that its airline customers want as spares. And frankly, I suspect that the phone lines between Christian Scherer and his opposite numbers at Pratt and Whitney are going to be red-hot for months to come. Because Pratt can only produce a certain number of spare engines every month, however hard they try. We know that the production system is quite tight and Airbus wants every single one of those, but so did their airline customers, as spares.

Joe Anselmo:

Tony Osborne, we've been hearing for years that Airbus wanted to balance itself a little better between commercial and military a la what Boeing did by buying McDonald Douglas in 1997. But that really hasn't happened, has it? I mean, we haven't seen Airbus's military business take off even with this military spending bonanza we've seen in Europe since the Ukraine war began.

Tony Osborne:

I mean you could probably partially blame that on the success of the A320 family, that I guess the balance of their business has gone through the roof with the commercial business. But the reality is that Airbus's military aircraft products haven't taken off in the way they perhaps hoped. I mean, A400M was supposed to be the great white hope, I guess, in terms of replacing all sorts of airlifters around the world. And we've only really got a couple of export customers beyond the initial batch of national customers, the six partner nations. And then Eurofighter is just being outsold by the French Rafale, and also the US F-35. And of course the US continues to dominate the outlook for spending, particularly in Europe. I mean we've just seen the Czech Republic sign on for F-35. In fact, I think it would be a total of 11 or 12 countries in Europe will have signed on for that aircraft. It has become the Eurofighter and the Eurofighter is less Eurofighter and probably more of a Middle Eastern Fighter at this point.

And then there's a whole challenge around getting more sales of Eurofighter and there's a whole political spat now occurring in Europe, where Germany is preventing additional sales of that airplane into Saudi Arabia, an existing customer of that aircraft. So Mr. Faury may have to deal with some of those political issues.

Another one will be around the future combat air system where last year we saw a whole issues around intellectual property and work share around the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and the combat aircraft at the center of that. And that delayed the whole program by a year. But it also meant that Dassault in France was taking a lot more control over that program. I think that's going to be a major task for Guillaume when he comes in, is to going to be to try and settle some of the dramas around FCAS.

Joe Anselmo:

Jens, are there any worries that the old EADS structure that was very politicized and was sort of torn apart by Mr. Faury's predecessor, Tom Enders, could be reasserting itself now with this new structure?

Jens Flottau:

In the outside world, I would say no. Inside Airbus, yes, maybe a little bit. I would say it's not really fair and it's not really comparable. You have to keep in mind that in a way they're going back to the old structure. There has been an Airbus commercial CEO for a long time, until Tom Enders joined the roles of group CEO and commercial CEO in what was also a very political move back then. When Guillaume Faury succeeded Enders in 2019, he kept that dual role and as I've said, that wasn't ideal. I fully agree with that. But Airbus remains political. So everything they do in the senior management level will also be viewed in that context.

It's also going to be interesting who's going to be the new Chief Commercial Officer at Airbus Commercial. What I'm hearing is that Benoit de Saint-Exupery is going to be the new Sales Chief. He's now the Head of Contracts and one of the closest colleagues to Scherer. He also happens to be French. So you've now got a German running the commercial aircraft business and of course his number two in the organization has to be French.

Joe Anselmo:

Sash, what are some of the challenges that Mr. Scherer's going to face in this new job? You talked about the GTF crisis. There's also looking at the potential launch of an A220-500, right?

Sash Tusa:

A220-500 is the plane that a lot of A220 customers really, really want. And Airbus have been playing this one I think, quite cleverly. They're holding off launching that because they know there'll be a bit of cannibalization from the existing A320neos at the smaller end of the line. So I think they're holding off until the A320, specifically, backlog has burned down a bit and they can then do a relatively bump free transition to the 220-500. Now that stage then the A320 family to all intents and purposes becomes the A321 family. You just have a variety of different ranges and capabilities of A321s. We're already seeing A321s north of 60% of some month's deliveries. It's phenomenally successful. So yeah, A220-500 is important. Ramping up though, all of Airbus's production rates should be going up.

The A220 production rate should be more than doubling. Their target is 14 a month. Well, they're about six a month at the moment. That's a big ask and in particular, they don't yet have a backlog for that, certainly on our numbers. The widebodies are going to nearly double in rate from the post-COVID troughs out to about 2025, 2026. That's not easy given how strained the supply chains are.

But then there's this much broader issue, which is how much does Airbus invest in what they refer to as digital, but it's basically the new production systems, the new integrated design systems, that will enable them to do the next generation of aircraft much more smoothly. I'm not sure about cheaply, I didn't think anything ever becomes cheap in the next generation, but much, much more smoothly than previous generations.

Because at some stage in the next three, four, maybe five years, I didn't think we can wait that long, there's going to be a new generation of aircraft launched by both Boeing and Airbus. And they can't do them the same way they did in the last time. So I think the investments in digital -- and Airbus is spending about 400 million a year on that at the moment, euros -- it's a very, very expensive process. And sorting out the internal production and supply basis, those are big ongoing challenges even away from the basic job of just trying to make sure you have enough geared turbofans to put on half the A320s you produce.

Joe Anselmo:

And Airbus has gained a big lead in what used to be a 50/50 market, the narrowbody market. Is digitization the one area where maybe Boeing could try to come in to catch up to Airbus?

Sash Tusa:

Yeah, I think it is. Boeing is certainly spending a lot. Boeing's now got the X-66 truss wing demonstrator. Airbus clearly has been spending money quietly on new generations of wing and fuselages and so forth. But I really think that Boeing has an advantage in terms of digital, to use the broadest term there. And that's Boeing's big hope for the next generation. Airbus can't afford to get that one wrong.

Jens Flottau:

On the other hand, one of its challenges is that it has to ramp up production and modernize at the same time, which has been a difficult balance to strike. And just strategically, you talked about the A220-500. Yes, that's a project, but there's also more to it, right? They have to launch the A220-500. Many of us think it'll be by the 2025 Paris Air Show. They also have to decide which engines to put on it and whether it's going to be just one manufacturer or two. And I guess right now, the mood is, it's certainly going to be two. The question is who's the second one and will Pratt even be on it? So that's one.

I just want to go back to Scherer as an Airbus executive for a moment, and remind people that he's 61 years old. He will retire in like four or five years probably, and he's got all these strategy decisions to make. Launch the A220-500, reset the relationship with engine suppliers probably in a big way and possibly as Sash says, launch a new narrowbody project.

So he's kind of toward the end of his Airbus career, but he's got huge decisions to make. And it seems to me that he's the right person here at the right time, because he's got this strategy background. He's been with Airbus for all of his life. When he was 10 years old, he was on the top of Toulouse airport, watching his father take off in the first A300 flight, Gunter Scherer, who was a flight test engineer on that first flight. So it seems to me that everything's coming together at this moment in time, and now he has to really deliver.

Sash Tusa:

It's a great backstory, isn't it? It's a lovely, lovely sort of circle of career and life there.

Joe Anselmo:

Tony, don't mean to put you to sleep with all this commercial talk, but tell us what are some of the ways the defense business needs to be transformed?

Tony Osborne:

I'm no business expert, but the key thing is to try and get exports, I think, for all of these programs. These are all really niche platforms that were built for European customers. They're expensive, they're exquisite. They need to move on with that. They need to try and get sales for these platforms. That's always going to be a struggle. Inevitable supply chain issues as well. So I think those are going to be the key challenges, just getting more and more of them out the door. We know that A400M program was basically, the numbers were cut back roughly eight or nine aircraft a year, to give them more time to get more exports out. At the Paris Air Show, the Eurofighter GMVH was talking about trying to get another 150, 200 Eurofighter sales in the next few years.

And the challenge there is that at least 48 of those are compromised by the German government's decision not to sell to Saudi Arabia. We've just seen the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, step into that argument. So I think it is literally about building up that export orders, changing possibly their approach to development. Also, they're also hindered also by the fact that so many nations have differing requirements. We saw that with the NH90. We've seen that with the Eurodrone. We've seen that with the A400M. We know that the head of the Defense and Space Division wants to see a different approach to having a minimal viable product that can then be improved. And I think that's going to be one of the ways forward that they will approach that.

Joe Anselmo:

And Tony, I thought your point about the neo just supercharging Airbus's commercial business was a really good one. If you go back to 2012, even Airbus didn't project that they would sell nearly this many neos and grow the business that fast.

Tony Osborne:

How do you balance against that, I guess, if that's suddenly 70% of your sales? Military sales are not going to balance off that and they never will. I mean, commercial will just now outpace defense sales astronomically now.

Sash Tusa:

I think Tony's absolutely right about the challenges in defense. I think there's one other issue that I'd like to raise. Airbus has got the world's number one commercial helicopter company, but the entire vertical lift industry is changing. It is actually fragmenting at the moment. On the one hand, you've got the very, very futuristic, frankly, the vertical military vertical lift programs in the US, and Airbus seems to be a long way away from that sort of program at the moment. On the other hand, you've got eVTOL, which is an absolute bottom end of the market, but may well take some of the future vertical lift market. And I think that the challenge with Guillaume Faury is to think what is the viable shape and direction for Airbus helicopters for the next 10 to 15 years. I do wonder actually whether Airbus Helicopters should be a standalone business or part of the much larger defense and space business, just accept, and that might actually help then Airbus helicopters do a better job in the military market, which is actually an area where they're very, very weak at the moment. Tiger is in its closing years. The attack helicopter NH90 has also clearly got challenges. I think the helicopter's business, there are some big strategic issues there, and I think giving Guillaume Faury time to actually look at those and probably make some quite hard decisions, would be a very, very good thing for the board.

Joe Anselmo:

Okay. Well, unfortunately we are out of time, so we'll have to end it on that note. But thanks to all of you for an insightful conversation, and Sash, it was great for you to join us, and we'll definitely have you back. That is a wrap for this week's Check 6 podcast.

Space lasers aren't just for James Bond - Airbus,"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXNwYWNlLWxhc2Vycy1hcmVudC1qdXN0LWZvci1qYW1lcy1ib25k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Once upon a time, there were space lasers in Disney movies, in James Bond films, and a whole slew of other cases involving fighting enemies, shrinking people, and spy games for example.

Not one involved using invisible lasers to move data. Starting at 10G per second.

Fast-forward to 2023, and here we are - a real-life, true story partnership combining space-tech innovation from a grassroots start-up (Xenesis) with a long-standing forward thinking company (Airbus Defence and Space) ready to bring to space a new means of broadband communication.

This partnership story started approximately 5 years ago, in 2018, when Xenesis was founded. Originating as an idea to better track airplanes …the application quickly expanded to accelerating data connections across the globe wherever speed of information delivery matters.

With that, as the conversations evolved between Airbus and Xenesis, it became clear that this technology could be immediately beneficial and impactful on an international scale. Enter: the International Space Station (ISS).

Now, Airbus has selected Xenesis to be the sole service provider for laser-optic telecommunications on the Airbus-funded Bartolomeo platform attached to the side of the ISS.

To begin service in 2025, this high speed data connection, estimating to move a minimum of 2 Terabytes of data per day (roughly the content of 2 million paperback books*), in concert with 7 strategically selected ground-stations, averaging 30 milliseconds or less in latency, will be a true enabler for sophisticated Bartolomeo use cases including, for example:

Moving complex DNA strand-detail, also known as the building blocks of DNA, for research and advancement of healthcare: From capillary experiments to zero-gravity growth tests, results are pouring in at high speed in space but take time to reach science labs on Earth. With the Xenesis laser connection, results can be delivered to Earth in real time. This level of speed will be a gamechanger compared to the current average 600 Mb/second data transfer rate on the ISS which today means that results are delivered piecemeal in separate data packages over a number of weeks that then need recompiling on Earth.

University and other student test-studies: Biology, materials science and astronomy are the main areas of research. Bartolomeo will enable scientists to receive complete result-sets, with optional priority real-time data transfer, while also leveraging store-and-forward technology.

Government proof-of-concepts: With secure access to critical data in real time, Bartolomeo facilitates research on international and national projects mainly in the environmental and defense fields. Thanks to real-time data, decision-making will be accelerated.

Earth observation: from the tracking of weather patterns, to crop management, forecasting and planning, or even carbon emissions outputs; observing our planet with accurate and complete data in a timely manner will allow further enhancements to and optimization of daily life.

And that’s just the beginning. In the future, laser-optic telecommunications from the ISS may support a variety of commercial and international customers working with complex data sets such as entertainment, sports, or gaming, or even facilitate edge-node computing to other stations supporting humans living and working in Lower Earth Orbit.

How is this achieved? Security, efficiency and speed of data movement. Essential building blocks for advancing humanity.

See, lasers in space aren’t just for James Bond! Learn more about Bartolomeo here!"
10/15/2007: Airbus Delivers First A380 to Singapore Airlines - Airways Magazine,"Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vZmlyc3QtYTM4MC1mb3Itc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"10/15/2007: Airbus Delivers First A380 to Singapore Airlines

DALLAS — Today in Aviation, Airbus delivered the first Airbus A380 (9V-SKA) to its launch customer, Singapore Airlines (SQ), in 2007. The airline’s then-CEO, Chew Choon Seng, described the new aircraft as “the new queen of the skies.”

However, Mr. Seng had previously slated the European manufacturer for severe delays in the aircraft’s delivery. The arrival of the first superjumbo was 19 months behind schedule. SQ had ordered 25 of the type, then known as the A3XX, on September 29, 2000, at a cost of US$8.6bn.

Singapore Airlines first became an Airbus customer in May 1979 with an order for the A300B4, the original widebody twinjet aircraft.

In Service

9V-SKA entered service on October 25, flying between Singapore (SIN) and Sydney (SYD). Flight SQ380 departed with a full load of passengers who had purchased tickets at a charity auction. Winners paid between US$560 for an economy seat and US$1,380 for a first-class suite.

The carrier donated all the money generated to three charities at a ceremony held in Sydney the following day.

Less than ten years after 9V-SKA was delivered, the airline withdrew the aircraft from the fleet on August 25, 2017. Despite being dubbed “the plane for today and tomorrow,” the aircraft struggles to live up to expectations. Its massive size made it difficult to fill and, therefore, difficult to make money.

19 Airbus A380s remained in the fleet before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the airline said it would retire a further seven from service in due course. SQ would announce that the type would re-enter service on November 18, 2021, flying to London Heathrow Airport (LHR).

Today, SQ’s active passenger fleet exceeds 130 aircraft, thanks to recent Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 deliveries, with the airline having 10 active Airbus A380s.

"EasyJet Raises Profit Outlook After ‘Record’ Summer, Orders More Airbus Planes - airlineweekly.skift.com","Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC9lYXN5amV0LXJhaXNlcy1wcm9maXQtb3V0bG9vay1hZnRlci1yZWNvcmQtc3VtbWVyLW9yZGVycy1tb3JlLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMv0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly9haXJsaW5ld2Vla2x5LnNraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwL2Vhc3lqZXQtcmFpc2VzLXByb2ZpdC1vdXRsb29rLWFmdGVyLXJlY29yZC1zdW1tZXItb3JkZXJzLW1vcmUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EasyJet expects operating profits nearly double analyst forecasts during the year that ended in September, after a banner summer travel season in Europe. That, in part, gave the European discounter confidence in ordering nearly another 150 Airbus A320neo-family aircraft.

UK-based EasyJet forecasts a £460-480 million ($560-584 million) pre-tax profit in its 2023 fiscal year that ended in September, the airline said Thursday. That’s better than analysts’ previous estimates. Revenue is forecast at roughly £8.2 billion, including £780 million from its booming EasyJet Holidays business.

EasyJet posted a £3 million operating profit in its last fiscal year, which ended in September 2022.

“We have delivered a record summer with strong demand for EasyJet’s flights and holidays,” CEO Johan Lundgren said Thursday.

The airline expects a £655-675 million operating profit in the quarter that ended in September. Unit revenues increased an estimated 8.5% year-over-year, and unit costs excluding fuel decreased by roughly 1%. EasyJet flew 9% more seats between July and September than it did last year.

Alongside the rosy profit forecast, EasyJet unveiled plans to order another 147 Airbus A320neo family aircraft for delivery from 2029-34. The deal, which includes 56 A320neos and 101 A321neos plus 100 new purchase rights, would allow it to fully retire its fleet of Airbus A319s as well as half of its A320ceos. Shareholders must approve the deal that is worth an estimated $19.9 billion at list prices.

The order is just the latest in a string of large aircraft deals from airlines. Earlier in October, United Airlines ordered another 110 A321neos and Boeing 787s. And Air Canada, Air France-KLM, and Cathay Pacific have all added new commitments to their orderbooks in recent weeks.

The deals come amid numerous aviation supply chain issues that are limiting industry growth. Needed inspections of geared turbofan engines made by Pratt & Whitney will temporarily ground up to 600-650 older A320neo-family planes next year. And Airbus and Boeing, despite attempts, cannot meet their aircraft delivery schedule commitments. Even maintenance of older planes, like Boeing 757s at Delta, is being held up due to a shortage of spare parts.

These issues limit what the big planemakers can produce today, and throw future production rate increases into question. EasyJet cited this in its rationale for the deal, saying: “Delivery slots for narrowbody aircraft … are very limited until at least 2029 from both Airbus and Boeing. EasyJet anticipates that this limitation will extend into 2030 and beyond.”

In addition, as part of EasyJet’s deal, it converted 30 existing orders for the A320neo to the larger A321neo, which seats 235 passengers. That additional seating capacity will allow the airline to continue to grow at its core primary airports, including Amsterdam Schiphol where the Dutch government is moving forward with plans to cut flights over the next few years.

The discounter has been the subject of consolidation chatter in Europe. In 2021, EasyJet reportedly rejected an unsolicited takeover offer from competitor Wizz Air and instead raised capital to fund growth outside of its core markets in northern and western Europe. That strategy included an order for 56 A320neos in 2022, plus the acquisition of new slots in key southern European airports including Lisbon.

However, despite the capital raising and aircraft orders, many continue to see EasyJet as a likely takeover target. Potential suitors include International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways and IAG. To date in the latest round of European airline consolidation, Italy’s ITA Airways, Norway’s Wideroe, and Scandinavia’s SAS have announced deals with, respectively, the Lufthansa Group, Norwegian Air, and Air France-KLM. And the government of Portugal launched the sale of a 51% stake in the airline in September.

“I don’t think that there is [a] genuine road map for any consolidations in mind [at] the low-cost airlines,” Lundgren said Thursday.

Looking ahead to the October-to-December quarter, EasyJet plans to grow capacity roughly 15% year-over-year. Yields are forecast “ahead” of where they stood during the same period in 2022.

The airline anticipates capacity growth to continue at roughly a 5% annual increase through 2028."
"New $150 million Airbus assembly line in Mobile will boost workforce by 1,000 - Fox 10 News","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMTgvbmV3LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lLW1vYmlsZS13aWxsLWJvb3N0LXdvcmtmb3JjZS1ieS0xMDAwL9IBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMTgvbmV3LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lLW1vYmlsZS13aWxsLWJvb3N0LXdvcmtmb3JjZS1ieS0xMDAwLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - Airbus was in a mood to celebrate Wednesday, with a stage full of A-list guests, a slick video presentation and even fireworks.

The occasion? A new assembly line that already is under construction.

“This is going to be our flagship in North America,” said Gerd Weber, head of the A320 family value stream management and final assembly lines. “And that makes us very, very proud.”

Added Nathan England, head of Mobile site development: “This will cement Mobile, Alabama, as one of the largest airplane manufacturing centers, not only in the country, but the world.”

The new final assembly line, announced in May 2022, will not be complete until midway through 2025. When it opens, it will be the third line at the company’s plant at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, and the second to produce the A320 family of aircraft.

That is the workhorse of Airbus, accounting for some 85 percent of the company’s orders. According to Airbus, it will boost employment at the plant from about 1,800 to 2,800, binging the total workforce in Mobile to 3,200 after counting employees at its engineering center and space and defense facility. According to the Alabama Department of Commerce, those jobs will pay an average wage of $65,000 a year.

Daryl Taylor, senior vice president of commercial operations for Airbus Americas, told reporters that it will double the plant’s capacity to produce the A320. He added that it is critical to meeting its global commitment to boost delivery to 75 planes a month.

“The only way we get to that is by adding this expansion, this third final assembly line in Mobile, second for the A320,” he said. “So our ability to meet that commitment in 2026 and on comes through the expansion here and the investment we’re making in Mobile.”

Airlines are having to wait years for delivery of the popular A320 because of a backlog of more than 6,000 planes. Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AereDynamic Advisory, told FOX10 News that the Mobile line will help Airbus but added that challenges remain.

“The good news is having more production lines gives them more flexibility and in theory, at least, allows them to work past that bottleneck of the final production and, of course, interior work and whatever else,” he said. “But the reality is, a lot of the bottlenecks have been elsewhere in the supply chain, like at the engine level, for example, or castings and forgings.”

Alabama taxpayers helped make the expansion possible. According to the Alabama Department of Commerce, the state is offering tax rebates and other incentives valued at almost $100 million to support the company’s $150 million investment. That includes an economic development cash grant of $20 million to reimburse capital expenditures; a jobs credit valued at $17.2 million over 10 years; and investment credit of $18 million over 10 years; and job training assistance valued at $41.6 million.

In addition, the Mobile City Council and the County Commission each approved $10 million over a decade.

The money is contingent on hitting job targets.

State Sen. Chris Elliott (R-Josephine) said he supports the taxpayer assistance – even though Airbus desperately needs to add capacity to whittle down a 6,000-plane backlog for the A320.

“That’s a great question and a fair question,” he said. “And the answer is, that’s the game we play. We talk about economic development incentives are part of that, and while I think we wish they would come organically, that’s not how it works.”

Mobile County Commission President Randall Dueitt initially was reluctant to agree to the incentives because he believes too many Airbus workers end up living in Baldwin County. But he said he has high hopes for a Mobile Chamber program offering relocation assistance to Airbus workers to live in Mobile County.

“Your taxpayers are paying that out of their tax dollars,” he said. “And I want to make sure that those jobs are coming to the people who live in the community and pay the taxes here.”

It was all smiles from the politicians on the outdoor stage on Wednesday.

“The scope of this project is nothing short of remarkable,” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said.

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson thanked Airbus for chancing the city’s image. With the expansion, Mobile will be the third-biggest Airbus manufacturing hub in the word, behind Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany. Stimpson noted how far the Port City had come since Airbus announced in 2012 it would build the facility and Brookley.

“We made a lot of promises on the front end,” he said. “And we were hoping we could keep them.”

Could there be another expansion down the road? Taylor would not commit.

“You look back at where we were five years ago, we probably wouldn’t have predicted we’d have a second program here,” he said. “A year and a half ago, two years ago, we wouldn’t have predicted to have a second FAL for the 320 at this scale. I think the reason we have been is because we’ve executed/ We’ve been a key our key pillar of Airbus’ overall growth and overall strategy.”

Aboulafia, the aerospace industry analyst, said the partnership has been good for Mobile and Airbus.

“Mobile’s working out pretty well for them,” he said.

Airbus U.S Space and Defense recently opened an office on 17th Street between Curtis and Arapahoe streets, spokesman Jonathan Murphy said in an email.

Vault 44.01, based in Calgary, Alberta, has leased an 8,000-square-foot space at 1125 17th St. in a 494,689-square-foot office tower. The company develops and operates carbon-capture and storage projects across North America to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from industrial sites.

Rob Sadler, chief commercial officer at Vault 44.01, said the company is growing and needed more space to accommodate its expanding team.

“Denver emerged as the optimal choice due to its favorable business climate and its wealth of talented professionals in the region,” Sadler said in a statement.

Real estate firm JLL represented Vault 44.01 in the transaction and the CBRE Group represented the landlord and owner, Hines. The office building is undergoing extensive renovations, including the addition of state-of-the-art conference facilities and outdoor spaces, according to JLL.

Airbus also has facilities in Fort Collins and Aurora. Murphy said the Denver office will have about 25 full-time employees, boosting the total number of staff members in Colorado to 50. The new office will serve as the hub for all employees in the western U.S.

“Colorado is a leader in emerging defense and national security space technology development,” Rob Geckle, chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space and Defense, said in a statement. “Expanding our footprint allows for greater interaction with customers and collaboration with leading companies and suppliers in the region.”

Colorado is evolving into an epicenter for defense and national security space companies, with several key installations across the state, including the U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Space Command, Airbus said.

Colorado’s aerospace industry is the second-largest in the country, behind California’s. Colorado has the nation’s largest private aerospace economy per capita, with more than 240,000 workers, according to the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.

French president Emmanuel Macron said the Airbus plant there demonstrated “our joint courage to make long-term commitments and to invest in technology and human capital.” The aircraft producer showed that the two countries can achieve technological leadership and can be optimistic “regarding the ecological transition and the challenges that come with it,” Macron argued. The informal joint government talks were meant to “create closeness during challenging times,” the president said.

The meeting that was aimed at improving relations between individual government members came after a difficult period in Franco-German relations, which in late 2022 even led to the postponement of a traditional ministerial meeting. Finding a joint stance on energy and climate policy, in particular the EU’s electricity market reform and the role of nuclear power, was expected to be high on the agenda of the countries that struggle to reconcile the crucial differences between their two energy systems. A key EU ministerial meeting, scheduled for 17 October, will deal with questions related to the EU power market reform and the introduction of so-called contracts for difference (CfD) for power producers across the bloc.

The coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the climate crisis and many other geopolitical tensions “more than ever” require close coordination between Paris and Berlin for the benefit of Europe at large. Besides questions related to artificial intelligence and digitalisation, this would especially be true for re-industrialisation, energy production, aviation and geopolitical capabilities, the president stressed, promising that “concrete answers” to central questions in this context will follow in the next weeks and months."

The all-Airbus operator operates 207 narrowbody aircraft.

Spirit said the checks were ""necessary"" and would impact its flight schedules. “While this action is being taken out of an abundance of caution, the impact to our network is expected to last several days as we complete the inspections and work to return to normal operations,” the airline's statement reads.

ADS-b data reveals that the airline cancelled 11% of its flights on October 20, 9% on October 21, and 8% on October 22. By October 23, the start of the current working week, the cancellation rate fell to 1% and was less than that the following day. While scores of Spirit's aircraft are impacted by the recall of certain Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines, FlightGlobal reports that these aircraft went out of service to facilitate inspection of airframe brackets for possible fatigue cracks. A 2018 airworthiness directive details the issue that affects first-generation A320 Family jets but not newer A320neo types.

Spirit operates sixty-two A320-200s and thirty A321-200s among its broader fleet, which also includes twenty-three A319-100s, eight-two A320-200Ns, and eight A321-200NX. It says it will deal with any problems before returning any aircraft to service. However, the airline did not say how long it would take to complete the inspections of the 25 planes. Spirit Airlines did not respond to a request from ch-aviation for further details."
easyJet Places Record $19.9 Billion Airbus Order to Fuel Growth - Business Traveler USA,"Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9lYXN5amV0LXBsYWNlcy1yZWNvcmQtYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British low-cost carrier easyJet has placed its largest-ever aircraft order valued at $19.9 billion with Airbus to capitalize on a travel boom and secure scarce delivery slots after a bumper summer.

The order stands for 57 Airbus A320-family planes, which includes 56 A320neos and 101 A321neos.

The delivery of these aircraft is scheduled between 2029 and 2034. Additionally, EasyJet has the option to purchase an additional 100 planes.

EasyJet’s fleet consists entirely of A320 family aircraft, single-aisle, short or medium-range planes ideal for its network of short-haul European destinations. While the airline’s fleet is still relatively young, some of its 333 jets are due for retirement over the next decade. With supply chain issues delaying aircraft delivery, especially for narrowbody jets, EasyJet was eager to get its orders in now.

“It’s been known now for some time that there is a difficulty to get slots,” easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said. “We did a very thorough process, as you can imagine. It’s taken over 12 months to get to the stage where we are today.”

Despite easyJet’s association with Airbus, Lundgren said the carrier had conversations with Boeing as it tried to secure planes. Both aircraft manufacturers have said that delivery slots for narrowbody jets are extremely limited until the end of the decade.

With the new orders, EasyJet is also anticipating growth and looking to economize on fuel. Including the new orders and anticipated retirements, EasyJet could fly an estimated 390 aircraft in 2034. And many of those planes will be larger than those EasyJet operates today.

The oldest planes in easyJet’s hangars, and the ones closest to retirement, are 54 Airbus A319s, which have 156 seats. The 101 A321neos easyJet has ordered comes with 235 seats and such high efficiency they burn around as much fuel as smaller planes.

By committing to larger aircraft, EasyJet responds to surging travel demand and increased congestion at European airports. The carrier has also changed 35 of its earlier orders for the 174-seat A320 neo into orders for the larger A321neo model.

Overall, EasyJet’s new planes will be 13% to 30% more efficient than the planes they replace, depending on the model.

“[The orders] will enable easyJet’s fleet modernization and growth to continue . . . while providing substantial benefits including cost efficiencies and sustainability improvements,” said Lundgren.

Order pending approval

EasyJet’s shareholders, including founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who owns a 15% stake in the company and has previously questioned the airline’s need for new planes, must approve the massive order.

Meanwhile, EasyJet has indicated that it will resume paying shareholder dividends early next year after a record-breaking summer.

The budget airline expects its pre-tax profit from July to September will be between £650 million and £670m ($794m – $819m). With losses earlier in the year, the airline anticipates its full-year pre-tax profit will be between £440m and £460m ($509m – $532m).

The windfall has been driven by an 8% increase in passenger numbers compared to the summer of 2022. EasyJet planes were 92% complete over the summer, with an average of 15 seats empty on an Airbus A320 flight.

Ticket prices were also up by 9% compared to the previous summer, with EasyJet’s average basic one-way fare rising by £5 ($6) to £69 ($84).

EasyJet also raked in cash through its package vacation business, EasyJet Holidays, which it said: “continues to outperform.”

Lundgren said: “We have delivered a record summer with solid demand for easyJet’s flights and holidays, with customers choosing us for our network, value and service.

“This performance has demonstrated that our strategy is achieving results, and so today, we have set out an ambitious roadmap to serve more customers and deliver attractive shareholder returns, underpinned by a continued focus on costs and operational excellence,” he added.

EasyJet is now targeting annual profits of £1 billion ($1.22 billion), a goal it says it will meet by operating larger aircraft, growing EasyJet Holidays, and reducing losses in the winter.

Lundgren said bookings for the winter were healthy but acknowledged that the airline may need to stimulate demand outside of peak school breaks with discounts."
EasyJet & Airbus Strike a Deal: Zero Carbon Flying with Carbon Removal Credits - CarbonCredits.com,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uY3JlZGl0cy5jb20vZWFzeWpldC1haXJidXMtc3RyaWtlLWEtZGVhbC16ZXJvLWNhcmJvbi1mbHlpbmctd2l0aC1jYXJib24tcmVtb3ZhbC1jcmVkaXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EasyJet is the first airline in the world that signed a contract with aerospace giant Airbus for its carbon removal initiative that will offset flight emissions with its Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology.

With Airbus’ Carbon Capture Offer, via its Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), EasyJet can use the carbon removal credits to advance its climate goals, and aviation’s decarbonization targets.

The deal makes the British low-fare airline the first partner of the Airbus carbon removal efforts.

Building a Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

The aviation industry is responsible for emitting about 3% of global energy-related carbon emissions, per data from last year. And as the world was recovering from the pandemic, aviation’s emissions started to climb again to >1 billion tonnes.

The hard-to-abate industry aimed to reach net zero emissions by 2050, primarily through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture. DAC is one of the widely available and scalable carbon capture technologies today.

DAC traps and removes carbon directly from the air, often through high powered giant fans. The captured CO2 is then stored safely in underground reservoirs. Or better yet, the gas can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel, further helping the industry cut its footprint.

While carbon emitted during aircraft operations can’t be directly rid of at the source, DAC can extract the same amount from the atmosphere.

EasyJet’s Group Markets Director Thomas Haagensen said that the airline considers carbon removal essential in helping them achieve their net zero goal. That entails investing into relevant projects like DAC to “accelerate the development of zero carbon emission aircraft technology.”

EasyJet Net Zero Roadmap

The Swiss airline plans to hit net zero emissions flying by 2050 as outlined in its roadmap published in 2022. The roadmap also says that EasyJet seeks to reduce carbon footprint per passenger by 78% by 2050.

The reduction will be through switching to fuel-efficient aircraft and greener fuels like SAF. The remaining 22% will be through carbon capture technologies.

EasyJet was one of the first major airlines to offset all of its emissions, amounting to 8.7 million tonnes. It’s also one of the first in the aviation to negotiate with Airbus to possibly pre-purchase durable carbon removal credits.

An executive from Airbus commented on their partnership noting that their deal shows EasyJet’s willingness to extend its environmental commitment. He further added that:

“Initiatives such as this one underline Airbus’ commitment to decarbonization solutions for our industry and to, bringing together airlines and industry players from all sectors in order to build a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

Airbus’ Commitment in Decarbonizing Aerospace

Airbus’ carbon removal credits at 400,000 metric tons will be issued by its partner DAC company 1PointFive. The carbon credits will be effective between 2026 – 2029.

1PointFive is a subsidiary of oil major Occidental (Oxy) focusing on carbon capture. The company is currently developing what it says will be the biggest DAC plant in the world – Stratos. The facility is in the Texas Permian Basin aiming to capture 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Airbus has been at the forefront of the aerospace sector’s decarbonization efforts. It has been consistently refining its products and services to better tackle climate change. The company is an active proponent of various global decarbonization initiatives to help curb the industry’s carbon footprint.

For instance, it’s spearheading innovations in aircraft and aerodynamic design and architecture to reduce the industry’s environmental footprint. Currently, all their units can fly with a SAF blend of 50% maximum, aiming to make it 100% by 2030.

While EasyJet is Airbus’ first partner, there are other operators that inked letters of intent for 1PointFive’s carbon removal initiative. These include the Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa Group, IAG, and LATAM Airlines Group.

Airbus’ carbon removal credits initiative for the airlines is part of its broader decarbonization strategies.

EasyJet’s partnership with Airbus marks a huge stride toward achieving sustainable aviation and reducing carbon emissions in the industry. Through carbon removal credits with DAC technology, they aim to offset flight emissions and accelerate the development of zero-carbon aircraft technology, contributing to aviation’s net zero aspiration."
Lufthansa brings its A380 back to Los Angeles International Airport - Lufthansa Group,"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1icmluZ3MtaXRzLWEzODAtYmFjay10by1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Great news for Lufthansa customers in the Los Angeles area! The popular Airbus A380 will return to Los Angeles International Airport on October 26. With air travel surging in demand, the added capacity that the A380 brings to the LA region will provide the much-needed increased volume that the market requires.

Flight LH453 will depart Los Angeles at 6:30pm and arrive into Munich at 1:40pm, the following day. Flight LH452 will depart Munich at 12pm and arrive back in Los Angeles at 4:15pm. All times are local. The already daily operating flights, now have increased capacity due to the placement of the A380.

Due to the sharp rise in demand for travel and the delayed delivery of ordered aircraft, Lufthansa decided in 2022 to reactivate the Airbus A380, which is particularly popular with passengers and crews. By the end of 2025, a total of eight A380s will once again be deployed for service to and from Munich.

The A380 aircraft

The Airbus A380 is one of the world’s most fuel-efficient aircraft, burning about 12 percent less fuel than other wide-body jets, and is approximataely 30 percent quieter than the current generation of wide-body aircraft. With 509 seats, the airline’s A380 has around 80 percent more capacity than its Airbus A340-600, which currently flies on the Boston – Munich and JFK routes. In total, Lufthansa’s A380 offers four classes of travel: 8 seats in First Class, 78 seats in Business Class, 52 seats in Premium Eco and 371 seats in Economy Class.

Located on the upper deck, the First Class cabin is one the quietest cabins in commercial aviation and boasts an air humidification system – the first of its kind to be installed on a commercial aircraft – that improves air humidity to help fight off jet lag. Two large, luxurious bathrooms with separate changing and lavatory areas offer enhanced personal space and storage. The cabin’s eight generously proportioned, ergonomic seats measure 6’9” feet in length and 2’7” feet in width and provide the ultimate in comfort and innovation for an exceptional travel experience.

Also located on the upper deck is the Business Class cabin with 78 seats featuring improved functionality, including more storage and a power supply that works with all worldwide connections.

The main deck is home to Lufthansa’s Premium Economy class, where 52 seats are situated in the forward most compartment of the A380’s main deck. In addition to more private space with up to 50 percent more legroom, Premium Economy allows guests to travel with two pieces of luggage weighing 51 lbs. each. On board, every passenger is greeted with a welcome drink and in-flight meals are presented on menu cards and served on fine chinaware. Premium Economy passengers will also find an amenity kit at their seats which includes practical travel accessories, an electrical plug, and a bottle of water.

The Economy Class is found on both levels of the aircraft. Each of its 371 seats features an in-seat video screen, an optimized ergonomic design, and a slimmer seat back that adds two inches of personal space per passenger."
Airbus Corporate Jets debuts the ACJ TwoTwenty - AOPA,"Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvb2N0b2Jlci8xNy9haXJidXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWpldHMtZGVidXRzLWFjai10d290d2VudHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three years after its announcement, Airbus Corporate Jets debuted the ACJ TwoTwenty at the National Business Aviation Association Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition on October 16. According to the company, the TwoTwenty is creating a new market segment, the “Xtra Large Bizjet,” which emphasizes cabin space, range, and technology at a similar price point to ultra-long-range jets.

According to Airbus, the ACJ TwoTwenty stands out for offering more than double the cabin space of traditional long-range business jets. The aircraft boasts more than 786 square feet of floor space, with an expansive six-zone cabin, two extra cabin zones for additional privacy, a true office environment with “best-in-class connectivity,” and 55-inch 4K televisions. The master suite features a California King bed and en suite bathroom with a rain shower.

Despite having twice the cabin space of ultra-long-range business jets, Airbus projects the AJC TwoTwenty will have lower operating costs because of reduced maintenance and training costs. The TwoTwenty is powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, “designed for lower fuel burn and COemissions, lowering costs, and reducing impact on the environment.”

“The ACJ TwoTwenty is set to become a game-changer in the business aviation market,” said Sean McGeough, vice president of corporate jets for North America. “It offers a unique combination of unmatched cabin space, intercontinental range, state-of-the-art amenities, and competitive pricing.”

“With a range of up to 5,650 nm (more than 12 flight hours), the ACJ TwoTwenty can meet requirements of 99.9% of all U.S. departures, connecting city pairs including Los Angeles to London, Miami to Buenos Aires, and New York to Istanbul,” the company said.

“As with all ACJ aircraft, the ACJ TwoTwenty is capable of flying with up to a 50 [percent] blend of kerosene and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while keeping to the technical specifications of Jet A,” the company said. Airbus proclaims that all of its commercial aircraft and helicopters will be capable of operating with 100 percent SAF by 2030.

In addition, Airbus Corporate Jets released the findings of a survey that showed 82 percent of U.S.-based business aviation financiers and private jet brokers expect access to business aviation financing to increase over the next three years. The same study found that 98 percent of respondents believe business aviation finance rates are still attractive, and it is still better to use credit when buying an aircraft as opposed to tying up capital."

""We would not normally order jets this far out,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, told reporters Tuesday. ""Production lines, which are now regularly plagued by supply-chain disruptions and delivery delays, are also increasingly sold out for the entire decade."" Deliveries of the new planes are scheduled to start in 2028.

United's order consists of 50 more Boeing 787 Dreamliners, adding to a firm order of 100 of the twin-aisle planes it announced last December, along with 50 more options. The airline has aggressively expanded its international service to try to capitalize on a resurgence of trips abroad, destinations that the new long-range 787 planes would serve.

The Chicago-based airline is also buying 60 Airbus A321neos, on top of the 120 it previously had on order with the European manufacturer, including 50 of forthcoming extra-long-range version. United added options for 40 more Airbus A321s.

United and other airlines have recently ordered new planes have said one way around infrastructure constraints is to operate larger aircraft with more seats on them, a practice known as upgauging. The airline said it expects an average of more than 145 seats per North American departure in 2027, up 40% from 2019."
Amazon Air gets its first Airbus A330-300 freighter - STAT Times,"Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXR0aW1lcy5jb20vYWlyLWNhcmdvL2FtYXpvbi1haXItZ2V0cy1pdHMtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtMzAwLWZyZWlnaHRlci0xMzQ5OTYy0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvYWlyLWNhcmdvL2FtYXpvbi1haXItZ2V0cy1pdHMtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtMzAwLWZyZWlnaHRlci0xMzQ5OTYy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amazon Air has taken delivery of its first Airbus freighter. This is the first of the ten Airbus A330-300 converted freighters that will join the e-commerce giant’s growing fleet of aircraft. The remaining nine freighters are scheduled to join the fleet later this year and in 2024. Amazon Air leased these aircraft from Altavair and the passenger to freighter conversion is being done by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), a joint venture between Airbus and ST Aerospace. The freighters will be operated and maintained by Hawaiian Airlines on behalf of Amazon Air under Hawaiian’s FAA air carrier certificate to move cargo between airports near the online retailer’s operations facilities. As part of the commercial agreement, Hawaiian Holdings, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, issued Amazon warrants to acquire up to 15 percent (post-issuance) of its common shares. The warrants are exercisable over the next 9 years. This is a common practice that Amazon Air follows with all their freighter operators that include Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) and Atlas Air Worldwide.

Taking off in a city near you. 🛫 Introducing #AmazonAir’s new A330!!



It's the first of its kind in our fleet and will help us deliver more packages with less flights, which means customers get their orders that much faster. 🙌 📦 Woot woot! pic.twitter.com/ePFLsrxzJx — Amazon (@amazon) October 2, 2023

Last year’s agreement also has an open plan for Amazon Air to expand the fleet depending on its future needs. However, the air cargo demand contraction, seen through this year so far, has necessitated Amazon to reduce outsourced air cargo capacity. Recently ATSG said that it expects to operate its B767 freighters with less flight time per aircraft and reduced schedules for Amazon.

With the introduction of A330-300 freighters, Amazon wants to take advantage of the A330’s capacity and economics to help fulfill its one-day delivery promise to Amazon Prime customers. Besides being the new kind of aircraft in the Amazon Air fleet, these are also going to be the largest aircraft for Amazon Air allowing the ecommerce company to deliver more customer packages with each flight.While both A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft are eligible for conversion, the longer-fuselage A330-300P2F is particularly suited for integrators and express carriers, due to its high volumetric payload capability with lower-density cargo."
Airbus opts for e-methanol and rotor sails for new transatlantic trio - Marine Log,"Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxvZy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtb3B0cy1mb3ItZS1tZXRoYW5vbC1hbmQtcm90b3Itc2FpbHMtZm9yLW5ldy10cmFuc2F0bGFudGljLXRyaW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus opts for e-methanol and rotor sails for new transatlantic trio Written by Nick Blenkey









Looking to reduce its carbon footprint, Airbus is to renew it entire fleet of vessels chartered in from France’s Louis Dreyfus Armateurs (LDA) to transport aircraft subassemblies between Saint-Nazaire, France, and its single-aisle aircraft final assembly line in Mobile, Ala.

It has commissioned Louis Dreyfus to build own and operate three new RO/RO vessels. Set to enter service in 2026, each will be fitted with six rotor sails and two dual-fuel engines operating on diesel fuel and e-methanol. The percentage of e-methanol used will be stepped up in line with the availability of the green fuel. Additionally, routing software will be used to optimize the vessels’ journey across the Atlantic, maximizing wind propulsion and avoiding drag caused by adverse sea conditions.

The new fleet is expected to reduce average annual transatlantic CO2 emissions from 68,000 to 33,000 tonnes by 2030. This will contribute to Airbus’ commitment to reduce its overall industrial emissions by up to 63% by the end of the decade, compared to 2015 as a baseline year, in line with the 1.5°C pathway of the Paris Agreement.

“The renewal of our marine fleet is a major step forward in reducing our environmental impact,” said Nicolas Chrétien, head of sustainability & environment at Airbus. “The latest generation of vessels proposed by Louis Dreyfus Armateurs are more fuel efficient than their predecessors, using cutting-edge technologies like wind-assisted propulsion. This demonstrates our determination to lead the way in decarbonizing our sector by innovating not just in aviation, but across all our industrial operations.”

“We are very pleased to have been selected by Airbus to develop this state-of-the-art and low-emission fleet and to continue our longstanding partnership,” said Edouard Louis-Dreyfus, president, Louis Dreyfus Armateurs. “This new project, setting high targets, reflects our ambition regarding the decarbonization of the shipping industry. We are proud to support our customers in their energy transition, going even beyond their expectations by offering innovative solutions and sustainably driving change.”

The fleet renewal also supports Airbus’s ambition to increase A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month by 2026. Each new transatlantic vessel will have the capacity to transport around seventy 40-foot containers and six single-aisle aircraft sub assembly sets – wings, fuselage, engine pylons, horizontal and vertical tail planes – compared to three to four sets with current cargo ships.

Currently, three vessels chartered in from LDA operate on Airbus’s two maritime routes. On the Mediterranean, the Ciudad de Cadiz makes stops at Airbus and supplier production facilities in Tunis, Naples, Porto and Saint-Nazaire. The Ville de Bordeaux and City of Hamburg cross the Atlantic. In September, LDA announced that the Ville de Bordeaux is to be retrofitted with bound4blue suction sails.

As the fleet is gradually renewed, the Ciudad de Cadiz will be retired from service. When the first of the new Airbus ships enters service in 2026, the City of Hamburg will transfer to the Mediterranean. When the second new vessel is delivered, the Ville de Bordeaux will move to the Mediterranean to replace the City of Hamburg and will continue to operate with the bound4blue eSails."
"Lockheed bows out, Airbus plows ahead in USAF tanker procurement; Boeing favored - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8yNC9sb2NraGVlZC1ib3dzLW91dC1haXJidXMtcGxvd3MtYWhlYWQtaW4tdXNhZi10YW5rZXItcHJvY3VyZW1lbnQtYm9laW5nLWZhdm9yZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Oct. 24, 2023, © Leeham News: Lockheed Martin Co. (LMCO) threw in the towel on Oct. 23, announcing it will not submit information to the US Air Force for the KC-Y aerial refueling tanker procurement.

But its partner, Airbus, quickly said it will respond to the USAF’s Request for Information (RFI).

“Airbus remains committed to providing the U.S. Air Force and our warfighters with the most modern and capable tanker on the market and will formally respond to the United States Air Force KC-135 recapitalization RFI. The A330 U.S.-MRTT is a reliable choice for the U.S. Air Force: one that will deliver affordability, proven performance, and unmatched capabilities.”

Lockheed’s withdrawal

Lockheed teamed with Airbus and announced in 2021 that the former would be the lead in submitting a proposal based on the latter’s A330 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport). LMCO later selected GE Aerospace as the engine provider.

But yesterday, LMCO said it was withdrawing.

“Lockheed Martin has decided not to respond to the U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 fleet recapitalization Request for Information (RFI),” a spokesperson said in a statement to the media. “We are transitioning Lockheed Martin’s LMXT team and resources to new opportunities and priority programs within Lockheed Martin, including development of aerial refueling solutions in support of the U.S. Air Force’s Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) initiative. We remain committed to the accelerated delivery of advanced capabilities that strengthen the U.S. Air Force’s aerial refueling missions.”

A combination of a few factors in the RFI shaped the decision, including additional development requirements and uncertain quantities, as well as the acceleration of the Next Generation refueling tanker program, said a person close to the situation.

Initially, the USAF indicated up to 160 KC-Y tankers, either the Boeing KC-46A or the MRTT, or both, could be procured. This was later reduced to 75 and Pentagon officials said they may prefer to issue only a follow-on order to Boeing for the KC-46A. The publication Breaking Defense wrote that with only 75 tankers, Lockheed had trouble making a business case. An order for 110 was needed, to pencil out, the publication reported, citing an LMCO official.

Boeing has written off about $7bn on its initial contracts for the KC-46A. The program has been plagued with delays, cost overruns, equipment that doesn’t work, and quality control issues.

Airbus forges ahead

Airbus’ decision to submit a response to the RFI is déjà vu all over again. In the late 2000 decade, Airbus teamed with Northrop Grumman to compete against Boeing for the KC-X tanker procurement. This pitted the MRTT against what would become the KC-46A. The Northrop team won, but the contract award was overturned due to Air Force procedural improprieties.

Northrop declined to participate in the rematch. Airbus went ahead, knowing it was unlikely to win but seeing benefits anyway. (This is detailed in the book, Air Wars, The Global Combat Between Airbus and Boeing.)

Airbus then, and now, planned to build a final assembly plant at its aerospace complex in Mobile (AL) to assemble the tanker. In the JV with LMCO, the planes would then be flown to Marietta (GA), Lockheed’s prime defense facility, for militarization.

The LMCO withdrawal raises the question of who will complete the militarization of the MRTT should Airbus prevail. Airbus had nothing to add, in response to LNA’s inquiry. LMCO said it will weigh future work on a case-by-case basis.

Observers expect Boeing to win either a sole-source, follow-on contract, or to prevail in a competitive bidding.

$40 million incentives to Airbus requires training for Mobile residents - AL.com,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEwL2FuLWluY2VudGl2ZS1wYWNrYWdlLXdpdGgtYS10d2lzdC00MC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1yZXF1aXJlcy10cmFpbmluZy1mb3ItbW9iaWxlLXJlc2lkZW50cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wendell Powell grew up in Mobile, and once rode his bicycle from his home to the sprawling Airbus operations south of the city’s downtown.

“Never knew I would work here,” Powell said on Wednesday during a celebration hosted by Airbus commemorating the company’s newest construction project – a second final assembly line (FAL) for its popular A320-series of commercial aircraft. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2025.

Powell, an Airbus employee within the A220 manufacturing plant, is the exact kind of worker the latest incentive package for Airbus aims to attract.

A total of $20 million was approved by Mobile County and City officials this summer on cash incentives to support the Airbus manufacturing project. That money is in addition to the $20 million the state is also supporting in cash incentives.

The $40 million in combined tax incentives comes after $25.8 million in combined state, county and local incentives were spent on the A220 manufacturing plant that opened in 2020. In 2012, state and local taxpayers invested $158.5 million in incentives to land the first Airbus FAL in Mobile.

“That’s the game we play,” said State Senator Chris Elliott, R-Josephine. “When we talk about economic development, incentives are a part of that. And while we wished (companies) would come in organically, that’s not how it works. It’s not how it works in other parts of the country. Just like you can’t use your hands playing soccer, this is the game, and these are the rules we play by.”

Mobile hook

But the recent round of local incentives have a hook previously unseen in other packages with the commercial aviation giant: At least $5 million coming from both the county and city will go toward workforce development aimed at incentivizing Airbus to hire Mobile County residents.

That incentive comes at a time when Baldwin County, among Alabama’s fastest growing counties, has far outpaced Mobile County in growth over the past decade or so.

“It’s always been important to me when dealing with economic incentives to an industry that since your taxpayers are paying for that out of their tax dollars, that you make sure you get something out of it,” said Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt, who led efforts with the Mobile Chamber to negotiate an incentive plan requiring Airbus invest $5 million toward apprenticeships and/or training programs to benefit Mobile-based students or adults with little to no formal skills or training.

The incentive packages are for the next 10 years and will cost the county and city $1 million every year for the next decade. There are claw back provisions focused on maintaining an employment count of 2,100 by the end of 2029. Minimum average hourly wages for the new jobs created at the new plant are to be $31.25 per hour.

“I’m a cheerleader for Mobile,” Dueitt said. “I don’t hate Baldwin County. I don’t hate Mississippi. But I ran for office in Mobile County. When I look at incentivizing a company with the taxpayers money out of Mobile County, I want to make sure Mobile County residents have an advantage for those jobs. That’s just very important to me toward making sure we do everything we can to make sure that happens.”

Dueitt said he is hopeful that of the 1,000 new jobs at the new FAL, he would like to see 70 percent of the employees relocating to Mobile County.

According to Britton Bonner, an attorney with Adams and Reese – which helped craft the original agreements this summer – about 60% of Airbus employees already reside in Mobile County. Another 30% live in Baldwin County, and 10% in neighboring counties.

Airbus plans to have the final assembly line project completed by mid-2025. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com).

Baldwin County, itself, has provided incentives to the company, though it’s not investing directly to the latest construction FAL.

Lee Lawson, president and CEO with the Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance, said the county is paying off a five-year investment toward workforce initiatives offered primarily to high school students and teachers through the Flight Works Alabama program that his housed in a 18,000-square-foot aviation center near the Airbus plant at Brookley.

“Airbus being here in Mobile does not mean it doesn’t help the surrounding communities,” said Baldwin County Commissioner Charles “Skip” Gruber. “We have to work together to continue providing employment for our citizens of this great state.”

Lawson said the Mobile incentive packages, focusing on training for Mobile County residents only, “is a very microscopic way of looking at an incentive package.”

“I think some of the folks in Mobile have been very outspoken on how to structure that and it’s up to them,” Lawson said.

He said incentive packages Baldwin County has adopted in recent years, including over $123 million in local incentives to land a massive $2.5 billion Novelis steel manufacturing plant under construction near Bay Minette, were done without any localized employment requirements.

“We looked at Novelis and its regional impact … will it have a large impact just like Airbus has had? Of course,” Lawson said. “Are there any Mobile dollars in that incentive package? No. I think that this is on a case-by-case basis.”

Lawson said the financial support for Airbus is “worth every penny we put into it and more.”

He said there are benefits Airbus has made on Mobile that are unmeasurable.

Indeed, speakers at Wednesday’s event highlighted what they said was how Mobile’s image has been bolstered by having Airbus operating its largest North American facility in the coastal Alabama city.

“You’ve changed the image of our city,” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said. “Building Airbus airplanes here just changes the perception of what goes on here in Mobile.”

Said Lawson, “there is not a dollar amount you can put from an incentive perspective where Airbus hasn’t generated a thousand times that for the community. They changed the image for Mobile. You can’t put a value on what over $1 billion in investment and thousands and thousands of jobs creates not only for this community (but for the region).”"
EasyJet Commits to Airbus Decarbonization Program - FLYING,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vZWFzeWpldC1jb21taXRzLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWNhcmJvbml6YXRpb24tcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EasyJet signed a contract with Airbus for its carbon-removal initiative, becoming the first airline to do so.

The aerospace company’s technology, available through a program called the Airbus Carbon Capture Offer, uses direct air carbon capture and storage, or DACCS, that allows airlines to gain carbon removal credits and support the movement to decarbonize aviation.

DACCS uses fans and filtration to extract CO2 from the air so it can be stored in underground reservoirs. While CO2 emissions from aircraft operations cannot be eliminated at source, the companies said, an DACCS can remove an equivalent amount from the air. EasyJet and Airbus said the technology is complementary to other carbon reduction efforts including sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

“Decarbonising a hard to abate sector, such as aviation, is a huge challenge and we believe carbon removal will play an important role in addressing our residual emissions in the future, complementing other components to help us achieve our pathway to net zero,” said Thomas Haagensen, group markets director at EasyJet. “Our ultimate aim is to achieve zero carbon emission flying and, as well as investing into important projects like direct air carbon capture technology, we are working with multiple partners—including Airbus—to accelerate the development of zero carbon emission aircraft technology.”

EasyJet was one of the first airlines to sign an agreement with Airbus in 2022 to negotiate regarding the possible pre-purchase of carbon removal credits. The credits EasyJet will receive through the deal with Airbus will last from 2026 to 2029, the companies said.

“EasyJet is a strong advocate of decarbonisation, for its operations and the wider aviation sector. This agreement demonstrates the airline’s willingness to extend its environmental commitment through Airbus’ Carbon Capture Offer,” said Julie Kitcher, executive vice president of communications, sustainability, and corporate affairs at Airbus. “Initiatives such as this one underline Airbus’ commitment to decarbonisation solutions for our industry and to, bringing together airlines and industry players from all sectors in order to build a sustainable aviation ecosystem.”"
King of the wing: Meet the man behind Airbus' UK supply chain - The Points Guy,"Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Jyb3VnaHRvbi1haXJidXMtZmFjdG9yeS1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the world of aviation, you don't get much bigger than Airbus — a company that has been the world's largest manufacturer of airliners since 2019.

A global behemoth, Airbus has operations facilities around the globe committed to the efficient design, manufacture and delivery of airplanes worldwide. One of the most important Airbus sites is in Broughton, Wales, where the company designs, tests and manufactures the wings for all its A320, A330 and A350 commercial planes.

The Broughton plant builds and delivers over 500 wing sets every year. If you've flown on a commercial Airbus flight in the last decade, its wings were likely built in Broughton and delivered to their operating airlines via gargantuan BelugaXL and BelugaST aircraft for final construction.

TPG recently went behind the scenes at Broughton to witness the landing and loading of a BelugaXL for a special episode of Airplane Mode.

You can watch the latest episode below:

During our visit, we also caught up with Paul Kilmister, Airbus' U.K. head of supply chain, to find out what goes into building and delivering Airbus wings and how he got started in the industry.

Becoming the wing king

Kilmister found his way into the world of aviation after studying supply chain management and logistics at Aston University in Birmingham, England.

""I'm one of the guys that did actually study supply chain, and I started on the Airbus graduate scheme,"" Kilmister said. ""Those early career schemes are really important for us at Airbus, and every year, we recruit 300-400 apprentices.""

Starting as a graduate allowed Kilmister to fully immerse himself in the company through a variety of placements in various areas of the Airbus supply chain.

""My first job at Airbus was actually looking after the fasteners [nuts and bolts] for the A380,"" Kilmister said. ""That was one of my first placements for three months, and then I did a number of other placements working on A330 jigs.""

JORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY

Since Airbus is a global company, Kilmister has worked worldwide, growing his expertise in all things Airbus.

He spent four years working in Hamburg, Germany, looking after airline customers, then worked in the U.S. for about 4 1/2 years before returning back to Germany.

""That was overseeing 11 facilities from the East Coast of the U.S. through to China,"" he explained. ""Then I stepped into manufacturing here [in the U.K.] three years ago just at the beginning of COVID.""

Over time, he rose to more senior positions, and now, 19 years later, he is Airbus' U.K. head of supply chain. His responsibilities include acquiring the components for all of the wings for the building process, as well as the delivery of all the wings: ""From building to finishing them and getting a Beluga to pick them up,"" he said.

Kilmister is humble when he talks about his role at Airbus, but don't let that fool you. This is a huge operation and one that could swiftly fall apart if an efficient supply chain isn't in place.

""Our suppliers are dotted all across the planet,"" Kilmister shared. ""So it's about getting those components, making sure that all of our suppliers are working to a plan that they're delivering to us on time, and making sure those components make their way around this massive campus [at Broughton].""

A well-oiled machine

With so many variables involved in wing construction and delivery, Kilmister spins a lot of plates each day. He prides himself on efficiency.

""When I start in the morning, I have a number of chatbots that tell me what's going on in my operation every morning,"" he explained. ""They're feeding me stats to get me up to speed. Not every Airbus leader has them, but I do. I find them really helpful.""

JORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY

One of the most important moments of each day is the plant leadership team meeting at 7:45 a.m. It helps ensure everyone knows what needs to be done each day and creates awareness of potential hurdles. The meeting is run with almost militaristic efficiency.

""We review safety, quality, cost delivery and people across every area of the plant,"" Kilmister explained. ""We cover absolutely everything in 15 minutes, and it very rarely overruns.""

Colossal operation

Efficiency at Broughton is a running theme. With so many moving parts and strict delivery deadlines, it's imperative that wing manufacturing and delivery run smoothly.

""On a typical day, we receive anywhere up to 250,000 individual items in this plant — nuts, bolts, washers, right up to major components that you see on the surface of the wing like flaps and slats that control the aircraft, then the fuel system, the hydraulics and electrical systems,"" Kilmister said.

That's before the Belugas arrive to deliver the wings to other Airbus hubs in Europe. The facility helps up to six Belugas a day land and leave to deliver the wings, according to Kilmister.

JORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY

As can be expected in such a huge operation, safety is paramount. Upon entering the loading hangar, all staff members and visitors pass through security scanners and change into a high-visibility jacket before being kitted out with ear defenders and safety shoes.

According to Kilmister, Broughton is one of the safest manufacturing sites in the U.K. in any sector, with typically only two to three lost-time injuries (incidents that delay production and might prohibit an employee from working the following day) per year.

It's an astonishingly low figure considering the scale of the work carried out at Kilmister's facility, which comprises around 5,000 employees spread across more than 100 different buildings.

""That's everything from security, engineering teams, design teams, supply chain, quality and all of our safety people,"" Kilmister said. ""We even have a dedicated fire service. You can just imagine catering alone. There's an awful lot of mouths to feed every day.""

The Broughton plant is almost like a small village with five eateries scattered across the site, multiple shops and even a fully functioning football ground and team set alongside the plant's various warehouses, hangars and production lines.

Beluga: Behemoth of the sky

JORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY

One aspect that makes operating the Broughton facility unique is the daily arrival and departure of mammoth BelugaXL planes that are a key part of the delivery of Airbus aircraft in Europe.

""I wasn't necessarily a plane fan when I started, but I think stepping into Airbus, you very quickly get the bug,"" Kilmister shared. ""The Beluga is the most interesting aircraft. It's just so different to anything else flying.""

Airbus previously operated five BelugaST air lifters, officially known as the A300-600ST Super Transporter, each capable of carrying a single A350 jetliner wing. However, by the end of 2023, the BelugaST fleet will have been gradually replaced by six new and much larger BelugaXL planes capable of carrying two A350 jetliner wings at a time.

Powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, the newer BelugaXL can carry a payload of 52 tonnes, with a maximum takeoff weight of 227 tonnes, wingspan of 60.3 meters and nose-to-tail length of 63.1 meters. To say that this iteration of the Beluga is a giant is an understatement.

JORDAN WALLER/THE POINTS GUY

""All of the Beluga ground operations are set as part of my organization, and we can take up to six Belugas in a day,"" Kilmister said. ""In terms of capacity, we're able to carry two A350-1000 wings. So it's a really big aircraft.""

During the morning TPG visited the Airbus Broughton facility, we witnessed a BelugaXL landing to collect a freshly completed set of wings before flying them to Bremen, Germany, for further work and then on to Toulouse, France, for final assembly. On a normal day, the entire process, from landing to loading and takeoff, can be over within as little as 60 minutes.

A larger impact

Outside of the day-to-day, the parts of Kilmister's work that he's the most proud of are twofold. The most important aspect of all, in his eyes, is how the company approaches sustainability.

""I'm really proud of how we're progressing to decarbonize aerospace from looking at the carbon footprint generated in our supply chain through to improving our manufacturing processes, looking at fuels that we're using and the design of our aircraft.""

To Kilmister, this is where Airbus can have the largest impact and, in the long term, could truly shape both the future of aviation and the planet.

""I'm here because I believe in our mission to decarbonize aerospace,"" he explained. ""You have an option, right? To be part of the solution or try and do something else. For me, I'm very much part of the solution.""

Airbus can also serve as a conduit in which people are able to come together.

""It's connectivity,"" Kilmister said. ""It brings people from all over the world together, brings families together, takes people on holiday and enables business and freight. What makes me proud is what our product does.""

SKYNET is a family of seven military communications satellites, currently operated for the UK MoD by Airbus, that provides strategic communication services to the UK Armed Forces and allies. SKYNET 5 is the most recent generation of this family. Airbus is currently producing the SKYNET 6A satellite, which is scheduled to launch in 2025.

The SKYNET Enduring Capability (SKEC) program will deliver the next era of satellite communications (SATCOM) to the MOD using new space assets and a way to monitor and control them. These assets will also be supported by additional commercial services to provide a reliable and robust communications service.

In August 2023, the UK chose three competitors to move forward on the SKEC effort, Airbus Defence and Space, Lockheed Martin, and Thales Alenia Space.

The SKEC space segment will consist of two separate procurements:

* A Narrowband Satellite System (UHF) requirement that will be delivered through a dedicated satellite (GEO orbit). Sevice entry is expected to run between 2028 and 2036.

* A Wideband Satellite System (WSS) requirement which will be delivered through a procurement for multiple medium-sized satellites (GEO orbit), including X and Mil Ka-band payloads. Up to three satellites will be produced valued at GBP1.5 billion ($1.9 billion). The first launch is planned for 2028. A winner for this procurement is expected in late 2023.

The overall SKYNET military satellite communications program is reportedly valued at around GBP6 billion ($7.3 billion).

Single-Pilot Operations Are Under Increased Scrutiny - Aviation Week,"Wed, 04 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L3NhZmV0eS1vcHMtcmVndWxhdGlvbi9zaW5nbGUtcGlsb3Qtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1hcmUtdW5kZXItaW5jcmVhc2VkLXNjcnV0aW550gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A push to develop procedures and new flight deck functionality that supplant a pilot even for short time periods is receiving increased attention from global labor groups that fear a direct path to aircraft designed for single-pilot operations.

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations and European Cockpit Association launched a joint campaign against single-pilot operations (SPO) this year without flagging any specific projects. Soon, targets emerged: projects underway at Airbus and Dassault as well as a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) study on extended minimum crew operations (EMCO) and SPO (AW&ST June 13-26, 2022, p. 32). EASA now says nothing will change before 2027, and SPO for commercial airline operations—if they ever happen—are much further off.

Airbus and FedEx discussed single-pilot A321 and A350 plans

EASA is studying concepts but does not have a timetable

Pilot groups are unified in opposition

While regulators will drive any reduced-crew operations (RCO) timelines, at least two large industry stakeholders have considered plans with far more ambitious timetables than EASA’s latest public statements.

Airbus has pitched two new freighters to FedEx that would leverage having fewer pilots on board, Aviation Week has learned.

The more radical proposal is an A321F that would be type-rated for two pilots at the outset but would attain single-pilot approval over time, documents seen by Aviation Week suggest. The second concept is an A350F approved for EMCO—essentially permitting one pilot on the flight deck during low-workload cruise portions of the flight, which could lead to needing fewer pilots on long-haul flights that require relief crews under current regulations.

The ideas, pitched in early 2022 and dubbed Project Morgan, are not moving forward at the pace Airbus envisioned due primarily to regulatory hurdles. But details in the documents lay out the manufacturer’s thinking on how SPO could evolve.

Under Project Morgan, Airbus would further develop concepts trialed under its Dragonfly program, such as automated emergency descents. These would converge with EASA’s EMCO work, which focuses on evaluating the risks and potential benefits of allowing a single pilot on the flight deck during low-workload periods (AW&ST Jan. 24-Feb. 6, 2022, p. 50).

The A350F plan proposed to FedEx envisioned a formal application in 2022 and entry into service—with at least some RCO approvals—in 2026. This would follow rulemaking and standards development by both EASA and the FAA.

When EASA unveiled its EMCO and SPO study last year, its timeline aligned with Airbus’ FedEx pitch. Its original target was industry consensus on EMCO and some approved operational applications such as single-pilot flight decks during long-range cruise by the middle of the decade. While the broad vision remains in place, both the regulator and the manufacturer have throttled back.

“We have been asked to look at single-pilot operations [for freighters] as industry has been approaching us to look at the viability of the case,” EASA Acting Executive Director Luc Tytgat tells Aviation Week. “We don’t have yet a pre-application, just . . . a partnership agreement with the industry actor. They want to question us [on] whether it is realistic or not. We are at step zero of the process.”

Regarding timing, he adds: “There is not so much activity. We don’t see [entry into service in 2025 or 2026]. Single-pilot operations is not something immediate.”

Airbus “is constantly looking for ways to improve and advance its range of products to deliver higher levels of safety, efficiency and performance,” the manufacturer tells Aviation Week. “We believe that pilots will remain at the heart of operations for the foreseeable future and that automation can play a crucial role by assisting them in the cockpit and reducing workload. . . . Our studies are based on a minimum of two operating crew per flight and do not involve flights with only one pilot on board. As we do so, we are in constant dialog with our customers and the authorities.”

Airbus is developing an A350F that is scheduled to enter service in 2026. It has not launched a new-build A321F.

“We have no further comment about the launch of an A321 freighter version,” the manufacturer says. “There are many studies, but not all of them see the light of day.”

Whether Airbus has shelved its A321F SPO plan or simply set it aside is unclear. But as recently as last year, it was crafting a sales strategy around the concept.

The A321F SPO plan included application to both EASA and FAA in 2023 and entry into service in 2027, according to the documents seen by Aviation Week. In parallel, Airbus would support development of what it dubs the “single pilot/second pilot-optional” certification project that would pave the way for full-mission SPO. FedEx would work with the FAA on operational details, including a pool of pilots trained to fly either alone or in traditional crew pairs. The ambitious project aimed for entry into service by 2030.

Several industry sources said the FAA’s list of near-term priorities does not include any substantial RCO work.

A FedEx pilot union source said Project Morgan has not been discussed with its ALPA-represented membership. FedEx did not respond to Aviation Week’s inquiries.

The increasing activity around RCO and pilot unions’ concerns stem from multiple concepts converging.

Automation’s evolution is bringing capabilities to the flight deck that supplant pilots. Airbus last year selected Thales’ PureFlyt as one flight management system (FMS) option for the A320, A330 and A350. Among the functionalities that Thales is building into the system is a “pilot assist” function, Yannick Assouad, executive vice president for avionics, revealed during this year’s Paris Air Show.

Designed to automate weather-related route changes and other unexpected flight plan diversions, PureFlyt will start as a function pilots must opt to use. Remove that critical step, however, and it becomes part of a truly automated FMS functionality.

“You can easily imagine a system that has [data from] millions of flights integrated—all the failure scenarios that you can imagine in the airplane and procedures to answer them are automatically loaded in that system,” Assouad said. “It can become a flight assistant with no pilot [activation]. It has the power to absolutely do that.”

While true SPO will require a step change in automation, aircraft designs also must evolve.

When industry shifted away from having a flight engineer as the third person on the flight deck, aircraft designs changed. Boeing Chief Pilot and Vice President for Flight Operations Craig Bomben suggests a similar shift would be needed to introduce single-pilot scenarios safely.

“As far as I know, there has not been a commercial airplane built yet that was designed for single-pilot operations,” Bomben said at a recent ALPA conference. “Because of that, there are certain things you cannot do from a single seat,” he added, using a jammed control as one example. “Solving that requires both pilots.”

As aircraft designs evolve, industry is exploring more reduced-crew scenarios on today’s aircraft. The concept dates back decades, starting with so-called controlled rest—or planned naps—in the cockpit.

EASA is among many regulators that, under very specific guidelines, allow one pilot to take a nap in their seat while the other stays at the controls. The European air transport industry took advantage of a 1989 NASA study published in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s journal the following year, flight safety consultant Bertrand de Courville explains.

“As a guiding principle, taking some rest in flight helps being in a good shape for critical flight phases, such as approach and landing,” says the French Air and Space Academy member and former Air France captain. “Electroencephalography shows sleep is a physiological need; it is no use trying to fight it. If you do not rest to recover vigilance, you will have a drop in alertness or fall asleep before you know it.”

The idea is to take a nap without settling into deep sleep. The total duration should be around 30 min., including a wake-up phase. Proponents say the practice helps prevent loss of vigilance but has limited impact on fatigue. Loss of vigilance and fatigue are different, even though building up fatigue paves the way for losing vigilance.

“Briefings are key,” de Courville says. Under the framework set by EASA for each operator to create its own procedures, briefings take place before and after the controlled rest period. Before, the crew discusses the situation, upcoming tasks and the possible need to wake up the sleeping pilot. After the rest period, the pilot who stayed awake briefs the other on the situation.

The FAA has studied it and even prepared a draft advisory circular (AC) in the early 1990s that would have allowed it. But opposition from pilot unions, notably ALPA and the American Airlines-affiliated Allied Pilots Association, kept the AC from being adopted, and subsequent guidance has codified the FAA’s position.

“The FAA authorizes inflight naps for flight crew if there is an augmented complement so that two pilots are on the flight deck while the augmented crewmembers are resting,” states a 2010 Basics of Aviation Fatigue AC. “Although a number of foreign air carriers authorized in-seat cockpit naps during flight, the FAA does not authorize such in-seat cockpit naps.”

ALPA President Jason Ambrosi says the union’s position has not changed. “Controlled rest is not a solution for fatigue,” he says. “That should not be a stopgap for proper rules. Our fatigue rules here in the U.S. allow for multiple pilots on long legs. There’s fatigue mitigation through actual rest, not controlled rest.”

ALPA sees controlled rest and EMCO’s allowance of one pilot on the flight deck while a second pilot naps as not just poor regulatory policy, but steps toward true SPO.

“There is no safety argument to be made” for having one pilot on duty at a time, Ambrosi says.

ALPA is backing its stance with contract language. Recently crafted pilot agreements at Delta Air Lines and United Airlines include provisions that require two pilots, for example. United’s contract updated the previous language that specified having two pilots on the aircraft. Now they must be on the flight deck.

Boeing’s Bomben acknowledges that the company’s automation-related research, which CEO David Calhoun has said will be a significant driver in its next clean-sheet airplane design (AW&ST June 19-July 2, p. 42), includes RCO concepts. “This has picked up a head of steam, and we could not ignore it,” Bomben said. “So we’re looking at it.”

Boeing’s approach is straightforward, Bomben said. It is looking at failure scenarios one by one and determining whether automated functionality might assist. It also is examining how the same scenarios would be affected by having one pilot at the controls, even for a short stretch.

So far, the results are sobering. One example is a notional EMCO scenario with one pilot on the flight deck while a second is napping in the crew rest area. The pilot flying has a seizure and inadvertently disconnects the autopilot. “Now you have an airplane that is not being flown,” Bomben said.

Malicious actor scenarios are another category that seems to conflict with permitting only one trained pilot on the flight deck, he added.

“There is a lot of technology being developed out there right now being touted as the technology required to go to reduced crew ops,” Bomben said. “Boeing is not going to support an effort that doesn’t meet an equal or greater level of safety.

“I’m not saying we’re not going to get there at some point,” he added. “But I’m telling you right now there are a lot of questions that need to be answered.”

"With Lockheed Out, Airbus Offering A330 MRTT To USAF - Aviation Week","Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9kZWZlbnNlLXNwYWNlL2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vbG9ja2hlZWQtb3V0LWFpcmJ1cy1vZmZlcmluZy1hMzMwLW1ydHQtdXNhZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will pursue the U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 recapitalization program on its own without prior partner Lockheed Martin, offering its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) for the competition.

Lockheed Martin announced Oct. 23 that it would not pursue the Air Force’s KC-135 replacement program following the release of a request for information (RFI) and requirements last month. Lockheed Martin and Airbus had teamed up on the LMXT, with Lockheed as the prime, first for the KC-Y bid and then for the KC-135 replacement.

“We are transitioning Lockheed Martin’s LMXT team and resources to new opportunities and priority programs within Lockheed Martin, including development of aerial refueling solutions in support of the U.S. Air Force’s Next-Generation Air-Refueling (NGAS) initiative. We remain committed to the accelerated delivery of advanced capabilities that strengthen the U.S. Air Force’s aerial refueling missions.”

The LMXT was a modified version of the A330 MRTT, with additional capabilities focused on Air Force priorities such as connectivity and survivability. It was to be built at an Airbus facility in Alabama and missionized at a Lockheed Martin facility in Georgia had the companies won the competition. Reuters first reported Lockheed’s decision.

In a statement to Aerospace DAILY, Airbus says without Lockheed it will still offer a U.S.-made version of the MRTT to the Air Force.

“Airbus remains committed to providing the U.S. Air Force and our warfighters with the most modern and capable tanker on the market and will formally respond to the United States Air Force KC-135 recapitalization RFI,” Airbus says. “The A330 U.S.-MRTT is a reliable choice for the U.S. Air Force: one that will deliver affordability, proven performance and unmatched capabilities.”

During the Paris Air Show in July, Airbus Defense CEO Jean-Brice Dumont said the company was committed to the competition, with it planning to define its setup to U.S. Air Force requirements.

With Lockheed Martin out, Boeing’s KC-46 remains the favorite for the KC-135 recapitalization program. When the Air Force first announced the program in March, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the preliminary requirements looked like buying more of the Boeing tankers was likely. The service had planned an acquisition program known as “KC-Y” to bridge the gap between KC-46 and a future NGAS. However, with NGAS becoming a higher priority that plan was canceled in favor of the near-term recapitalization program."
Why Thai Airways is selling its fleet of Airbus A380 planes - New York Post,"Sat, 14 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwLzE0L3doeS10aGFpLWFpcndheXMtaXMtc2VsbGluZy1pdHMtZmxlZXQtb2YtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s not the type of auction you see every day.

Back in August, Thai Airways announced it would put its fleet of the world’s largest commercial airplanes up for sale.

The invitation called for qualified buyers to offer bids for any of its six Airbus A380 aircraft — the massive four-engine, double-decker jet that can carry more than 500 passengers.

None of the planes are particularly old. They couldn’t possibly be: The A380 has been in the air for less than two decades.

Nonetheless, Thai Airways hasn’t flown its A380s since the pandemic, and a subsequent plan last year to get them back in the air didn’t materialize.

The auction seemingly marks the end of Thai’s run with the aircraft, with bidding reportedly starting at an initial deposit of just $50,000 per plane — which once had a list price of roughly $450 million.

But Thai Airways is hardly alone in viewing the A380 as more a part of its past than future — even as the jet still garners the affection of the 300 million passengers who have flown on it since Singapore Airlines took delivery of the first A380 some 16 years ago.

“It was a popular airplane when it was introduced back in 2007 and remains a popular airplane with passengers today,” said Shea Oakley, a commercial aviation historian based in New York.

“The bigger issue,” Oakley explained “Is has it been good for the airlines? And it’s more of a mixed bag there.”

The numbers speak for themselves.

Airbus delivered a total of 251 A380s over roughly 14 years. Today, just 154 remain in service, according to airline data analysis firm Cirium. Nearly 80 A380s are currently in “storage,’ meaning they haven’t moved in the past 30 days. The rest have been retired.

By year’s end, global airlines will fly an estimated 77,000 flights with the A380, Cirium reports. That’s down from nearly 120,000 in 2019. The stark numbers come as the TSA recently recorded its busiest summer ever at US airports.

This included a 15% increase in international passengers at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport versus July 2022. Overall, annual global air traffic was up more than 26% this past July — and currently stands at near pre-COVID numbers.

You don’t have to work hard to spot an A380. Head down to JFK and several arrive daily from cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. And passengers can still fly on the planes over the remaining years — if not decades — of life left in the world’s existing A380s.

But that will likely be it.

Airbus stopped building the A380 after delivering its final superjumbo in the waning days of 2021.

That the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer ultimately produced just 251 A380s is clearly disappointing, considering early projections of 750 or more in the skies. Some aviation experts predicted the plane would become a linchpin of air travel’s future.

Indeed, at the 2000 Farnborough Air Show in England, where Dubai-based Emirates Airlines placed the first order for a superjumbo, the A380 appeared poised to become a worthy successor to the iconic Boeing 747.

Compared to the 747, this plane was bigger and more advanced. Airbus touted the A380 as “setting a new standard for the global aviation industry.” And in many ways it did.

With its unmatched onboard cabin space, the A380 provided airlines ample room to customize its interiors. Emirates — which purchased nearly half of all the planes — designed a stand-up bar and suites where you can take a shower at 35,000 feet. On a more practical level, Oakley points to the smooth, turbulence-light ride afforded by the aircraft’s size.

8 “It was a popular airplane when it was introduced back in 2007 and remains a popular airplane with passengers today,” said aviation historian Shea Oakley of the A380.

“It’s not that the A380 doesn’t have incredible technology — it does,” he pointed out. But, Oakley added, ‘it was sort of the wrong plane at the wrong time.”

In truth, many of the A380’s greatest attributes helped fuel its downfall — from its four huge engines, to its unprecedented maximum takeoff weight of 1 million pounds, along with 500+ passenger capacity.

“In theory, the A380 should have been successful because it lowered the per-passenger cost,” said Kerry Tan, a professor at Loyola University Maryland, whose research focuses on airline industry economics.

“But that assumed that all of the seats — or at least most of the seats — would be full,” Tan said. “Airlines thought the demand would be there, unfortunately, it wasn’t necessarily the case.”

The late 2000s recession was particularly ill-timed for the A380, with the jets rolling off the assembly lines just as the global economic downturn reduced global passenger demand by the largest numbers since World War II, according to the International Air Traffic Association.

The impact on the A380 was immediate: After delivering its first A380 to Singapore Airlines in 2007, Airbus followed with a dozen more in 2008, just 10 in 2009 and 18 in 2010 — well below initial projections.

Then, in the years that followed, the A380 received stiff competition from even newer-generation wide-body, long-haul planes that were far more fuel efficient, operating with just two engines to the A380’s four.

In 2014, Airbus debuted the twin-engine A350, which this year will fly four times as many flights as the A380, per Cirium data (though with far fewer seats).

Boeing similarly built the more fuel-efficient, twin-engine 787 Dreamliner, complementing its existing 777, which launched in the late 1990s and remains a staple of many airlines’ long-haul fleets.

8 “You cannot cut the aircraft in half and fly with it,” said Ahmed Abdelghany of the challenges placed by the A380’s huge passenger numbers. @embryriddledaytona/Instagram

Smaller, but still carrying between 200 and 400 passengers, these planes are lighter than the A380, burn less fuel and offer more lucrative cargo capacity. The A350, for instance, will one day serve “Project Sunrise,” the longest route in the world between New York and Sydney.

The flight, already being tested, will span 10,000 miles and take over 20 hours to complete.

While the public may love the A380’s stature, most airlines now prefer planes with fewer seats and more flexibility. “You cannot cut the aircraft in half and fly with it,” said Ahmed Abdelghany, an expert in airline network planning who today serves on the faculty at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “If something happens in the demand, I’m stuck with that big aircraft . . . but if I have a relatively smaller [aircraft], let’s say, for example, a 787, it gives me . . . more flexibility.”

Smaller planes also allow airlines to serve a wider range of cities and at more times, giving passengers more choices with fewer connections.

These point-to-point routes stand in sharp contrast to the “hub-and-spoke” strategy touted two decades ago which helped spur initial A380 demand.

Big planes, like the A380, would fly between the largest airports — such as in Dubai or Singapore — that then feed passengers onto smaller destinations on secondary flights.

But today’s travelers want more flights directly to and from more cities, Oakley said.

“That means smaller, long-range airplanes. Not huge, four-engine airplanes” like the A380.

Faced with such headwinds, in 2019, former Airbus CEO Tom Enders cited “no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production,” when he announced the company’s “painful” plan to stop building the plane.

At least on the Airbus side, the A380 was finished.

A year later, the pandemic forced many airlines to ground their super-jumbos, with some carriers suggesting they might never fly the A380 again.

Air France, for instance, announced the “definitive end” to its A380 service in the spring of 2020, accelerating a “fleet simplification strategy” centered around the 787 Dreamliner and A350.

More recently, though, something changed — at least sort of.

8 Newer airplanes like the sleek Boeing-787 have proven more cost-effective and flexible than the A380. The Boeing Company

As travel has roared back over the last two years, more A380s have returned to the skies. In late 2021, for instance, British Airways relaunched its A380s between Britain and the US.

More recently, Frankfurt-based Lufthansa announced it would return all of its eight A380s to service by 2025. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has also deployed some of its grounded A380 fleet.

A European startup carrier called Global Airlines has acquired four cast-off super-jumbos in hopes of flying an A380-exclusive fleet in the future.

And Sir Tim Clark, President of Emirates, the largest A380 customer, openly wondered to CNN last year whether there might be a future for an equally large but more fuel efficient version of the fuel-guzzling giant.

Clark’s words were likely a case of wishful thinking: last year Airbus made clear that it has no plans to restart production, having already converted A380 hangers over to the production of other, smaller airplanes.

Bijan Vasingh, an aviation economics expert, doubts any such rebirth is possible.

“That would be very expensive,” Vasingh, also of Embry-Riddle, explained. “I don’t see any point that Airbus would bring it back. Production was dismantled.”

Indeed, although the number of A380 flights increased by 53% this year, according to Cirium, they remain far below pre-pandemic levels.

Still, for a jet once seen as a successor to the venerable 747 — which had 1,600 jets made and remains an iconic symbol of aviation, including flying as Air Force One – Oakley is clear on how history will remember the largest commercial aircraft ever built.

“As a footnote,” he said of the A380, “unlike the 747, which will be remembered as one of the greatest aircraft ever designed.”"
UTM is a key enabler of AAM - Airbus,"Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEwLXV0bS1pcy1hLWtleS1lbmFibGVyLW9mLWFhbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) is a completely new ecosystem that has to deal with unmanned vehicles. Air Traffic Management (ATM), our current system which relies on human controllers communicating with pilots, cannot handle the integration of these new aerial vehicles (passenger and cargo drones, air taxis, and other eVTOLs), which will fly together in low-altitude airspace and will be either fully autonomous or piloted remotely.

Airbus sees Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) as a complete ecosystem that includes not only a certified vehicle, but also the support and services needed to maintain the aircraft, UTM and ATM, flight operations, urban infrastructure, and customer engagement. All of these pillars must be in place for eVTOLs to become operational. Balkiz Sahrian, Head of Urban Air Mobility at Airbus, states: “The ultimate goal is to connect communities safely and to do so with a sustainable approach. While working at full speed on CityAirbus NextGen, we have taken into account the full complexity of the entire ecosystem. This means we need to consider the other pillars as enablers for the CityAirbus NextGen in operations. This also includes UTM as part of ATM”.

“We need to make sure that our vehicles can be integrated into the evolving unmanned traffic management (UTM) system,” states Miguel Ángel Vilaplana, Head of Airbus UTM. “This integration needs to be safe, effective, and automated to manage a growing number of vehicles that will be flying simultaneously in an airspace that is already busy.”

Advanced Air Mobility

UTM as part of a holistic vision

Airbus started working on UTM in 2017, with the creation of the Company’s AAM vision. “When we launched the UAM strategy at Airbus, we did something pioneering and decided to look at the whole ecosystem in a holistic way: that is, to ask how these aircraft were going to be integrated into the airspace. How would these vehicles recharge? What would the business case be for all this?” recalls Miguel Ángel Vilaplana. “National states cannot define UTM on their own: They need the help of the aviation industry to provide these services. Pioneering this type of work was an opportunity to shape the future digital aviation ecosystem working together with regulators, air navigation authorities and industry partners.”

Unmanned Traffic Management

Applications at all levels

Even if the vehicles are unmanned, UTM has to perform similar functions to those traditionally carried out by today’s air traffic management system: issuing take-off clearances, approving flight plans, installing measures to keep vehicles safely away from each other and so on. However, the scope of ATM and UTM is fundamentally different.

“The perimeter of UTM starts in the very low levels of airspace, from zero ground level to 500 feet, mainly around cities, but there could also be applications of unmanned aircraft for agriculture, inspections in remote areas or medical equipment transport that can go beyond cities,” explains Vilaplana. “Nevertheless, we also see applications of UTM principles at very high altitudes, to deal with the digital integration of stratospheric drones. In addition to our activities with the UAM team, we are currently working with Airbus Defence and Space on the Zephyr programme in this direction. You can see UTM evolving like a “sandwich”, focusing on the lowest and highest levels, integrating with ATM in the middle and gradually contributing to a future integrated ecosystem. Our common vision is to have a safe and fully integrated airspace.”

In order to have a complete vision of the needs of all air traffic, the UTM and ATM teams at Airbus work closely together and collaborate with all the divisions. “We obviously work hand-in-hand with the Helicopters division to carry out our eVTOL project, but we also work with the Defence and Space division in its ambition to build civilian drone applications, as well as with Commercial Aircraft, to make sure we contribute to protecting and transforming today’s ATM. We don’t want to negatively impact the capacity and we need to keep our commercial aircraft flying as safely and efficiently as they do now,” explains Miguel Ángel Vilaplana.

It is expected that initial AAM operations will be piloted and make extensive use of the corridors as identified by EASA and FAA; in this environment Airbus believes that selected UTM services will already enhance the safety of manned AAM operations in uncontrolled airspace. Moreover, Airbus should use the opportunity that AAM development provides to advocate for an extended use of such services by other stakeholders (e.g. AMS). This would also pave the way for the evolution towards a digital integrated airspace, by starting to use UTM services to improve the safety of selected manned aviation operations, which today have limited situational awareness (mostly VFR flights in uncontrolled airspace).

Going forward, AAM is expected to evolve towards more autonomous operations with traffic management functions enabled by digital UTM services.

Unmanned Traffic Management

Today’s services for tomorrow’s flying aircraft

Today, Airbus is already providing basic operational UTM services in the US to automatically provide authorisations to drone operators under the Federal Aviation Administration’s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) programme. This expertise will be transferred and utilised in the development of CityAirbus NextGen and will serve as a blueprint for Airbus´ ATM operations.

The aim of this programme is to safely integrate small drones into national airspace, and is designed to provide services both to private pilots wishing to fly their aircraft and to companies wanting to optimise their unmanned aerial system operations. On the European side, the European Commission recently adopted the U-space regulation, the first-ever regulatory framework for UTM operations. This regulation took effect in January 2023 and is expected to foster the growth of civilian drone operations in Europe through new digital and automated services such as flight authorisations, strategic deconfliction and contingency management support, while assuring an appropriate interface with manned aviation and air traffic control. The U-space regulation is expected to evolve over the coming years to enable large-scale eVTOL operations in the next decade.

“The current U-space regulations need to be understood as a first step for the integration of eVTOLs into the airspace management. As airspace is global, it will be crucial to harmonise the FAA and EASA regulatory standards for flight operations ranging from vehicle certification to UTM and AAM regulations,” explains Balkiz Sarihan.

Alaska retires last Airbus A321s and moves on with all-Boeing fleet - Flightglobal,"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxlZXRzL2FsYXNrYS1yZXRpcmVzLWxhc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFzLWFuZC1tb3Zlcy1vbi13aXRoLWFsbC1ib2VpbmctZmxlZXQvMTU1MjA1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US carrier Alaska Airlines recently retired from revenue service its final 10 Airbus A321 aircraft, clearing the way for its long-planned all-Boeing fleet.

The Washington-based airline said on 2 October that its final revenue flight using an A321 was completed on 30 September. Flight 1126 departed Seattle at 18:30 and arrived in Los Angeles at 21:18.

“We’re close to finding a new home for the A321s and expect to announce where they’re headed in the next few weeks once contracts are finalised,” says an airline spokesperson.

The Oneworld carrier in March 2022 outlined its plan to retire its A320, A321neos and De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400s by the end of 2023, as it focused its regional fleet on Embraer 175 jets and its narrowbody operation on a mix of Boeing 737NGs and Max jets.

In January, Alaska’s regional subsidiary Horizon Air operated the last of its Dash 8s.

Cirium fleets data show that Alaska has 163 737NGs and 56 737 Max aircraft in service. Horizon is currently operating 41 E175s.

Additionally, Alaska said on 2 October that it will soon receive two 737-800s coverted for cargo – the first by year’s end and the second in early 2024 – to support its freight-hauling operations in the state of Alaska.

The additions will give Alaska Air Cargo a total of five freighters – three 737-700s and two 737-800s. Alaska adds that the two additional aircraft would fly to the Bristol Bay fishing community of King Salmon.

”Those freighters will also be certified to fly long hauls over open water, including non-stop from remote communities like King Salmon to Seattle,” Alaska says."
Safran sits pretty as Airbus breaks vertical integration of IFC - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvc2FmcmFuLXZlcnRpY2FsLWludGVncmF0aW9uLWlmYy1zdXBwbGllcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) has ensconced itself in a sweet spot in the inflight connectivity sphere. A decision made years ago to disrupt the vertical integration of IFC suppliers — by supporting an uncoupling of hardware from the service — is paying off, with Airbus turning to SPI to provide both the Ka- and Ku-band terminals and integration work for its new Airspace Link HBCplus linefit supplier-furnished IFC program, even as the airframer separately tapped Viasat London (formerly Inmarsat) and later SES to provide the Ka IFC service, and more recently Intelsat and Panasonic Avionics to supply Ku multi-band IFC service.

“It goes with our overall strategy for connectivity,” SPI vice president, global sales and marketing Jared Siqueland told Runway Girl Network at the Global EXPO in Long Beach, California. “We are not trying to be the service provider. Our core expertise, if you look at the history of the company, has been reliable products. We’re really, really, really good at the system integration of these systems, hardware development, all that. But we are not going after the service aspect of connectivity. It’s saturated and although there’s been some consolidation, it’s saturated and that’s not our core expertise. Our expertise is the system on the aircraft.”

He added:

We also saw a need to break the vertical integration of every connectivity supplier even going back to our original offering, and kind of going towards — we say ‘agnostic’ — but going towards a cell phone model that we’re used to: [providing] a really good quality equipment and you can go to different service providers, ultimately bringing that service cost down.

HBCplus is groundbreaking in that it enables participating airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the linefit IFC hardware on their aircraft. There is, of course, a cost to the terminal equipment. But SPI believes that “driving a little more competition in the market is healthy for everybody, benefitting the airline on the operational side to bring that price per megabit down”.

One might argue that SPI made the right decision to stay out of the service side of the industry. With the exception of a few outliers, satellite operators serving as aero ISPs now dominate the IFC landscape in commercial aviation, which is among the reasons why certain value added resellers (VARs) are assessing their positioning in the market. Inmarsat-now-Viasat Global Xpress (GX) value added reseller SITA, for instance, has opted to cease being a GX VAR beginning in January 2025.

So, whilst Safran Passenger Innovations offers GX terminal hardware (including legacy kit featuring Honeywell’s JetWave Ka-band gimbaled antenna plus its nextgen terminal with ThinKom Solutions’ Ka2517 VICTS antenna as core), it never became a GX service provider.

“Could have called it a little bit of luck, could have called it some smarts,” said Siqueland in reference to SPI’s decision not to become an aero ISP. But at the same time, Safran’s focus on hardware, and this uncoupling of hardware and service in the Airbus ecosystem allows each side — hardware and service — to focus on their knitting.

“We look at some of these service providers that have fallen under the HBCplus program. They have really great expertise in managing satellite networks and providing high levels of service,” said Siqueland. So, given Safran’s strong investment in new terminal technologies — and its plans to “continue to invest in new terminal technologies even beyond what we’ve announced for the future” — the providers are hopefully “also seeing a benefit in that of ‘we own that piece, they own the service piece and let’s really create great services for the industry.'”

From this vantage point, the service providers certainly seem to be on board with Airspace Link HBCplus. “[H]ere’s what I care about, that the thing works and is good,” Intelsat SVP, commercial Dave Bijur told RGN flatly when the new Ku-band terminal for this Airbus program was teased at the Aircraft Interiors Expo this spring in Hamburg.

One of the things that Panasonic Avionics is excited about with respect to the the Airbus supplier-furnished antenna is it can support LEO and GEO service simultaneously, noted company vice president, connectivity business unit John Wade at the recent Global EXPO in Long Beach. (Elsewhere, terminal specialist Stellar Blu Solutions, which is a partner to both Intelsat and Panasonic, is benefitting from hardware/service uncoupling in a different fashion on Boeing programs.)

Indeed, for the multi-orbit, Ku-band side of HBCplus, available from Airbus in 2026, SPI has adopted for its terminal Get SAT’s newly branded AeroLesa electronically steerable antenna, which can simultaneously transmit via LEO and GEO satellites.

“[In] my opinion, the whole debate of Ka/Ku is starting to go away,” said Siqueland. “And especially with this Ku terminal being able to support dual beam, it makes it really interesting for airlines depending on their route structure where maybe they have holes in their current GEO coverage. And also, the operational costs of this: being able to leverage maybe LEO networks when you don’t need to pull this big MB stream from a GEO network. Obviously, there’s some commercial aspects that need to get worked out a little bit further on, how that would look like, but this does make it possible to talk to a GEO and LEO [satellite] simultaneously on an aircraft depending where they are in their route.”

He continued:

It may even technically be possible to have two different service providers in the same aircraft; don’t know how that will materialize. I think we need to get further down the road to see how those service contracts are going to play out.

A multi-orbit, multi-band terminal may also be in the cards in roughly ten years. “[W]e have our eye on the prize which is the epiphany of a multi-band antenna … being able to have a multi-band GEO, MEO, LEO.” That paradigm will require a software-defined aero modem, he said.

Those modems are also, incidentally, now in the spotlight as Intelsat explores adding a MEO constellation to its GEO/LEO service proposition, as supported by its own GEO satellites and its role as a OneWeb LEO service distribution partner in aero.

Neither the airline nor the aircraft builders has confirmed the value of the new orders, but based on available data for list prices of the aircraft, United’s total commitment for the 110 new jets would be worth as much as $20 billion, though large-volume orders typically incorporate discounts.

In a conference call, United Airlines chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella indicated the orders are intended to serve the carrier’s intention to grow its revenues on international routes, which are forecast to grow at a faster rate than domestic travel. ""In the future, United will increasingly turn to global growth to expand,"" Nocella said.

In addition, United is preparing to increase the size of the aircraft it operates, apparently in an effort to resolve current problems with runway volume at domestic airports.

""I’m convinced our strategy is the right one as we continue to add new, larger aircraft to take full advantage of our growing flying opportunities both internationally and domestically,” stated United CEO Scott Kirby.

Another factor for United and other carriers is the increasing volume of backlogged orders for Boeing and Airbus, which has led to aircraft deliveries being scheduled further into the future. United does not expect deliveries from the new orders to begin until 2028.

From Boeing, United picked up options for 50 new 787-9 Dreamliners, and secured options for 50 additional Dreamliners. Late last year United ordered 100 Dreamliners, and with the new orders it stands to become the largest operator of Boeing 787s in the world.

As with the Boeing order, United is expanding an earlier order with Airbus for its A321neo aircraft, the largest version of the A320neo narrow-body series. With the new order, United has a total of 180 A321 aircraft on order."
A350F production launch at Aerostructures and Premium Aerotec - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMtMTAtYTM1MGYtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1sYXVuY2gtYXQtYWVyb3N0cnVjdHVyZXMtYW5kLXByZW1pdW0tYWVyb3RlY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has received 39 firm orders for the new A350F version since its launch in July 2021. In June this year, the livery of the very first aircraft was unveiled during the Paris Air Show. All that is missing now is the A350 freighter itself.

The aircraft has taken a decisive step forward in recent weeks with the arrival of first components from the plants in Stade, Bremen, and Varel. Airbus Aerostructures and Premium Aerotec (PAI) teams met for the so-called ‘first metal cuts’, although metal was not actually involved every time.

Melanie Markgraf, ASA A350F project manager, witnessed the production starts at Varel and Bremen live. She considers them a special moment on the path to A350F industrialisation. “In 2013, I was lucky enough to celebrate the first flight of the A350, together with many other colleagues” Melanie says. “Ten years later, it is vital to make one of the biggest evolutions of this fantastic aircraft a reality. Every day, a lot of our colleagues work on exciting and challenging tasks to achieve this goal. With the production start at the Bremen, Stade, and Varel sites, we have taken a major step forward together.”

June 2023: kick-off with the lower shell in Stade

At the Stade plant, introducing the A350F will have a big impact on existing fuselage shell production. Additional CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced plastic) bonding jigs will be procured, in particular for the upper shell which will contain a large part of the future cargo door cut-out. The freighter lower shell is, in principle, similar to the A350 passenger version. For its first flight and steep take-off tests, the first A350F will be equipped with flight test instrumentation (FTI), requiring substantial reinforcement of the lower shell’s skin laminate.

The three large CFRP doublers required for this purpose were manufactured by the Stade fuselage shell production organisation using a special process. During the fuselage shell assembly, the doublers will be mounted to the normal outer skin using more than 4,000 additional rivets.

“Since this process would occupy our automated riveting system for a full week and in order to minimise the impact on the series production process activities, we carried out this assembly work with a small team during the summer break” explains Thomas Meyn, industrial project manager at the Stade site“. The employees on the shopfloor and in the support functions were willing to work during the summer break to ensure the start of assembly”.

July 2023: first thermoplastic cut for intercostal component in Bremen

The Bremen teams have been hard at work, too. The first component referred to as the freighter intercostal has been industrialised and is ready for delivery. This component is essential for the frame structure of the forward cargo door, which will be subjected to high loads. It is only one of roughly 1,400 components that are industrialised at the Bremen plant and will later be installed in all ASA workshares.

These components are the joining elements between the frames, the skin, and the system connections. Production of the thermoplastic components is one of the crucial factors for the assembly of the freighter.

The Centre of Competence for technological development and industrialisation of complex thermoplastic CFRP components has yet again demonstrated its expertise for the freighter project. This is largely thanks to a high degree of employee engagement at the Bremen site and successful implementation of automated and digitised systems. “The A350F is a great challenge for all those involved, but we will master this one, too”, summarises Norbert Dombrowski, head of ME design consulting.

First metal cut at Premium Aerotec in Varel

Premium Aerotec is responsible for some of the A350F’s major components and is an important supplier to the programme. With the ‘first metal cut’ at the Varel site, i.e. the manufacture of the first machined part, Premium Aerotec has now launched production of this new aircraft type.

Next stop: Nordenham

The detailed parts and subassemblies for section (S) 13/14 will be delivered to the Nordenham plant, where they will be assembled to form a complete section. For S16/18, the individual shells originate from Augsburg and Stade and the floor structure is produced in Nordenham. After the components have been joined in Hamburg to form the complete sections, both will be transferred to the system installation stage.

The first steps of the A350F industrialisation have been taken and the process continues. Melanie Markgraf concludes by saying, “Let’s take advantage of this energy boost to master the upcoming tasks and make freighter history!”

This is the A350F

The A350F is based on the world-class A350-1000. The freighter features a fuselage length optimised for cargo operations and an extra large cargo door on the main deck. Over 70% of the airframe is made from advanced materials, enabling Airbus to reduce the take-off weight by over 30 tonnes for the same mission. The aircraft thus provides an advantage of at least 20% lower fuel burn and CO 2 emissions over its competitor product. With a payload capability of up to 111 tonnes (five tonnes more payload and 11% more volume than its competitor), the A350F serves all cargo markets, from express traffic to general cargo, and even outsize loads. In the large freighter category, it will be the first to fulfil the ICAO CO 2 emissions standards for 2028.

Coordinated organisation for developing and producing the sections

Aerostructures develops the forward section, whereas the engineering responsibility for the aft section lies with Airbus Operations. Both sections are manufactured in close collaboration between Premium Aerotec and Aerostructures. The forward shells and the main deck cargo floor for both sections come from the Nordenham shop floor, the rear side shells from Augsburg, the rear upper and lower shells from Stade, with Varel supplying the surrounding area of the door for both the smaller forward doors and the large main deck cargo door. Section assembly for S16/18 as well as the general system installation for both sections take place at the Hamburg site."
Airbus and Northrop Grumman shake on pact for UK’s lucrative SKYNET satellite program - Breaking Defense,"Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1zaGFrZS1vbi1wYWN0LWZvci11a3MtbHVjcmF0aXZlLXNreW5ldC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtcHJvZ3JhbS_SAX9odHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC9haXJidXMtYW5kLW5vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4tc2hha2Utb24tcGFjdC1mb3ItdWtzLWx1Y3JhdGl2ZS1za3luZXQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXByb2dyYW0vP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Correction 10/25/2023 at 10:49 am ET: The original version of this story included a quote from a Northrop Grumman executive referring to a past space agreement signed by the company and Airbus. This has been removed.

BELFAST — Defense and space industry giants Airbus and Northrop Grumman have teamed up to develop a “strategic partnership” aimed at securing spoils from the UK’s £6 billion ($7.3 billion) SKYNET military satellite communications program.

The two manufacturers signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday, designed to “bring together the latest technology” from each company and committing to mutually share “experience, knowledge and capability” to meet SKYNET’s competition requirements, according to an Airbus statement.

The UK MoD announced in August that Airbus, US prime Lockheed Martin and the Franco-Italian Thales Alenia Space group had been selected to take part in the SKYNET Enduring Capability (SKEC) Wideband Satellite System (WSS) Pre Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase. Only one of the three will go on to receive a production contract.

An Airbus spokesperson told Breaking Defense the company expects the UK MoD to open an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) phase, a procurement procedure where competitor bids are further assessed prior to any contract award, “before the end of the year.”

The WSS acquisition has a contract value of $1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) to support the design, manufacture and “post-design services” of up to three wideband Geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite systems, ground equipment, and launch operations, but the MoD has previously said the wider SKYNET program comes with an estimated value of £6 billion ($7.3 billion) and will include additional contracts.

A chosen contractor is expected to deliver on the WSS contract from December 2025 to December 2040, according to a prior industry notice. The new satellites are set to enter service between 2028 and 2036, replacing older capabilities.

SKEC’s second major line of effort covers a GEO Narrowband Satellite System (NSS) with an in-orbit date of 2028. Industry was asked to respond to a Pre-PQQ phase in August 2022. Airbus and Northrop Grumman are also partners for this effort.

Airbus already holds a contract valued at more than £500 million ($610 million) for SKYNET 6A, a future military communications satellite planned for launch in 2025 and based on the manufacturer’s Eurostar Neo telecommunications satellite platform.

Babcock and other industry partners claimed a separate £400 million ($488 million) award in February to operate and manage the SKYNET 6 satellite constellation, otherwise known as Skynet Service Delivery Wrap (SDW)."

The year-over-year growth rate of both companies also tells the same story, with Boeing’s deliveries indicating a decline of 6.3%. Meanwhile, Airbus registered growth of 22.9%, suggesting that it also surpassed BA in growth trajectory.

Defense Deliveries Decline

Boeing reported defense deliveries of 28 airplanes in the third quarter of 2023, highlighting a decrease of eight jets from the prior-year tally.

The shipments of AH-64 Apache (remanufactured) deliveries increased by one jet to nine compared with the year-ago period’s tally. Meanwhile, the delivery of AH-64 Apache (new) declined by two jets to five compared with the year-ago period.

Story continues

Moreover, the company’s CH-47 Chinook (new) jet delivery in the third quarter remained unchanged at one compared with the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, three CH-47 Chinook (renewed) jets were delivered in the reported quarter compared with two in the third quarter of 2022.

The shipments of F-15 Model jets were nil this quarter compared with four in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the delivery of the KC-46 Tanker was three compared with one in the year-ago period, while three F/A-18 jets were delivered the same as the previous year’s count.

The delivery of P-8 models decreased by two jets from the second-quarter 2022 tally at two.

The delivery of MH-139 declined by three jets compared with the previous year’s count of four. The company delivered one T-7A compared with nil in the prior-year quarter. No commercial and civil satellites were delivered this quarter.

Peer Prospects

Prominent jet makers who are yet to report their third-quarter delivery numbers are Embraer S.A. ERJ and Textron TXT.

In the last reported quarter, Embraer delivered 47 jets. ERJ delivered 17 commercial and 30 executive (19 light and 11 midsize) jets compared with seven commercial and eight executive (six light and two midsize) jets in the prior quarter.

The long-term earnings growth rate for Embraer is pegged at 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 22.1% from the prior-year reported figure.

Textron delivered 44 jets, down from 48 in the year-ago quarter. It also delivered 37 commercial turboprops, up from 35 in the second quarter of 2022.

The long-term earnings growth rate for Textron is 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2023 earnings indicates growth of 31.4% from the prior-year reported figure.

Price Performance

Shares of Boeing have rallied 47.1% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.

This new agreement, which will run between 2023 and 2028, was signed at an event held near Jakarta.

The MTS partnership with Garuda Indonesia’s maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) subsidiary was first established in 2013. This has led to the integration of GMF AeroAsia’s instructors and GMF Training Centre into Airbus’ worldwide maintenance training organisation.

With the renewal, the European manufacturer’s customers in South East Asia will continue to benefit from having their A320 and A330 maintenance training needs undertaken in the region, based on Airbus’ global standards.

Raymond Lim, Airbus Asia-Pacific Head of Customer Services said: “The renewal of this agreement reflects the strong partnership between Airbus, Garuda Indonesia and GMF AeroAsia. Various Airbus customers have benefitted from having their courses conducted by GMF and their trainers. I am positive that future trainees will benefit from this arrangement as we prepare for the industry’s future growth.”

Airbus has a long relationship with airlines in Indonesia dating back to 1979, when Garuda Indonesia placed its first order for the original A300B4. Today, nearly 210 Airbus aircraft are in service in the country.

We toured Qatar Airways’ US$73 million VIP Airbus A319 private jet - Style,"Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC1ob3RlbHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMjM3ODI1L3RvdXItcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy11czczLW1pbGxpb24tdmlwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5LXByaXZhdGUtamV0LWNvbnZlcnRlZC1haXJsaW5lci1ib2FzdHMtbGFyZ2UtYmVkcm9vbdIBsAFodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC1ob3RlbHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMjM3ODI1L3RvdXItcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy11czczLW1pbGxpb24tdmlwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzE5LXByaXZhdGUtamV0LWNvbnZlcnRlZC1haXJsaW5lci1ib2FzdHMtbGFyZ2UtYmVkcm9vbQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Unbeknown to many fliers, Doha-based Qatar has a private charter division called Qatar Executive that caters to the airline’s “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”.

Qatar Airways’ award-winning business class is not the airline’s only moneymaker.

Founded in 2009, the wholly owned business sports a fleet of 20 customised private jets, including the Gulfstream G650ER, the recently delivered Gulfstream G700 and the Bombardier Global 5000. However, the biggest and most extravagant option is the US$73 million Airbus ACJ319, which is the business version of the manufacturer’s commercial A319 airliner. ACJ stands for Airbus Corporate Jets.

Qatar Executive actually has two versions of the plane, one with a VIP layout and one that serves as an air ambulance with two medical stations.

To get an idea of how the company’s most elite customers travel, I toured Qatar Executive’s VIP ACJ319 at the Paris Air Show in June – take a look inside.

Inside Qatar Executive’s VIP ACJ319 plane

Qatar Executive’s VIP ACJ319 features a grand entrance

According to Planespotters, the converted airliner was actually a Qatar government plane for over 20 years before being transferred to Qatar Executive for private charters – and it’s exactly what I imagine when I think of how the world’s richest people travel.

Starting at the front of the jet, customers will enter and turn right into a narrow hallway that leads to the various seating options on board. The grand entrance provides a heightened sense of privacy as the cockpit and jump seats are completely separate from the passenger area.

The bedroom in Qatar’s ACJ319 looks just like a hotel room, except in the sky

Unlike other large business planes like Donald Trump’s Boeing 757 or the Bombardier Global 7500, the bedroom on Qatar’s ACJ319 is located at the front of the plane instead of the back.

The room is complete with a bed, plush linens, pyjamas, a side table and a large flat screen television.

The flat screen television in the bedroom is large

The bedroom is fully private and easily big enough for two people to snooze on long flights, especially since the ACJ319 can fly about 11,265km nonstop – meaning the jet can connect cities like New York and Rio de Janeiro, Paris and Johannesburg, and Shanghai and Sydney.

Look out of the window while you’re handling your business

Near the bedroom is a large private lavatory stocked with towels and toiletries. There’s also a window by the toilet, which is a unique place to be getting a bird’s-eye view of the Earth.

The open cabin is the ideal spot for sharing meals and conversations

Beyond the bedroom is an open cabin that looks to be useful for meetings, dining or playing tabletop games. There were two sets of four loungers each surrounding a table, which was set up with a tablecloth and silverware for eating.

The reclining seats were huge and comfortable – easily a much nicer place to work compared to an office cubicle.

The reclining seats are comfy enough for sleeping, and are equipped with curtains

Separated by a curtain, this section of the ACJ319 is where those not lucky enough to claim the bedroom can get some shut-eye.

The pros … and some cons

Qatar’s ACJ319 is perfect for those travelling in small groups

The plane is good for situations like families travelling together or colleagues heading out on a business trip, with space for 19 people in total.

The cabin features 12 lie-flat beds in a 2 x 2 layout, meaning they have business-class-like perks, but window seat passengers lack direct access to the aisle. When the aisle seat is in lie-flat mode, the window seat passenger will have to climb over to get to the aisle – or ask their neighbour to adjust the seat, which can be a hassle.

However, considering the clientele, Qatar likely doesn’t see this as a big concern since guests are likely to already know each other.

The reclining seats are reminiscent of Qatar’s old business class before its award-winning upgrade

The loungers are actually pretty similar to Qatar’s old business class before it introduced its award-winning Q-Suites. Passengers may recognise the colours and design, a well as the little touches like storage and an amenity kit.

However, the seat did lack the large entertainment screens typically present on lie-flat products – but Qatar Executive has a different offering.

Guests can watch entertainment offerings on distributed iPads instead of seat-back screens

In lieu of a seat back screen, the company has installed a mount for iPads, which are distributed to guests and loaded with films and TV shows.

This is common on other large private airliners, like the Abercrombie & Kent Boeing 757 that operates “air cruises” with lie-flat business class seats.

Qatar’s ACJ319 has a crew rest area towards the back of the plane

Behind business class, customers find another lavatory, a wardrobe and two crew rest seats, all of which are curtained off. Crew rest areas are common in long-haul private jets like the ACJ319 to ensure pilots and flight attendants get their required rest.

You can also find crew rest areas on smaller business planes like the G650ER, as well as on jetliners like United Airlines’ Boeing 767 or JetBlue Airways’ Airbus A321neo.

Guests can cater their own dining on board

As far as the meal service, guests can cater the food they want on board, which will be served by flight attendants, thanks to the large galley in the back of the plane. Customers can probably eat anywhere on board, but the aforementioned dining area makes the experience more high-class.

The dining table is common on board large private jet as companies like Airbus cater to the wants of VIP customers – specifically separate living areas for eating, sleeping, working or just watching TV.

Long-haul flights come with a six-figure price tag

The private jet’s dining area is set up properly for meal times

According to private jet charter broker Air Charters Advisor, the per hour cost to operate the Airbus narrowbody starts at US$16,500 but will vary based on factors like fuel cost and demand. This means an eight-hour journey from Chicago to London could cost at least US$132,000 one-way.

While Qatar Executive’s biggest private jet option is the ACJ319, those with a smaller party may opt for the carrier’s G700 plane once it starts flying.

Qatar Executive fleet boasts other private jets like G700 for its VIP clients

Expected to start serving VIP customers in the coming months, the newest addition to the Qatar Executive fleet is the G700 with a total of 10 on order. The jet sports a club area with tables and large loungers, an entertainment room with a convertible couch, as well as a separate bedroom.

Albeit smaller, the US$75 million G700 is still one of the largest purpose-built private planes on the market – meaning it wasn’t originally an airliner reconfigured as a business plane like the ACJ319.

Doha-based airline Qatar Airways also owns 15 Gulfstream G650ERs

Meanwhile, Qatar also sports the world’s biggest fleet of Gulfstream G650ERs, frequently used by billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

The 15-strong G650ER fleet has been Qatar Executive’s workhorse since 2015 and the lavish planes come with most of the perks of the G700 – including the bedroom."
EFW Begins Airbus Freighter Conversions In Istanbul - Aviation Week,"Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9lZnctYmVnaW5zLWFpcmJ1cy1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItY29udmVyc2lvbnMtaXN0YW5idWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"German freighter conversion specialist Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) has launched operations at a new Airbus passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion line in Istanbul, in partnership with Turkish Technic.

EFW, which is a subsidiary of ST Engineering and Airbus, performs freighter conversions on A300s, A310s, A320s, A321s and A330s.

On Oct. 30, EFW announced that its new third-party freighter conversion site in Istanbul had commenced operations, in collaboration with Part 145 and Part 21 maintenance provider Turkish Technic.

“Its first A330P2F was inducted as scheduled in October,” EFW says. “With the Istanbul site, EFW has a total of nine modifications sites carrying out its conversion programs across the globe.” EFW CEO Jordi Boto says Turkish Technic has “deep experience” of Airbus aircraft, including strong structural skills.

The A330P2F program, which covers the -200P2F and -300P2F variants, was developed together with ST Engineering and Airbus. EFW holds the supplemental type certificate and leads the program, including sales and marketing activities.

ST Engineering and EFW have set up conversion sites in Asia, the U.S., and Europe, growing their Airbus P2F capacity."
