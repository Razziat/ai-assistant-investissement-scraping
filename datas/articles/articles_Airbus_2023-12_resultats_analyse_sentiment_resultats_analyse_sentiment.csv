Hybrid and electric flight - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9sb3ctY2FyYm9uLWF2aWF0aW9uL2h5YnJpZC1hbmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion is rapidly revolutionising mobility technologies across industries, from automotive to marine. And the aviation industry is no exception. At Airbus, our work in electric flight aims to lay the groundwork for future industry-wide adoption and regulatory acceptance of alternative-propulsion commercial aircraft and urban air vehicles.

On the path to low-carbon flight A range of technologies are required in order to meet the aviation industry's decarbonisation ambition. These include improving operations and infrastructure; deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); and innovating through technology. Radical shifts with new concepts in propulsion will continue to be developed, such as hybrid powered aircraft. It is a major challenge that the industry will answer collectively with engine manufacturers and other industries such as automotive. In November 2022, Airbus and Renault Group signed a research and development agreement which aims to leverage synergies to accelerate both companies’ electrification roadmaps. In June 2023, Airbus and STMicroelectronics signed an agreement to advance research on the next-generation of semiconductors, which are a key enabler of the aerospace industry’s transition to hybrid and full-electric aircraft like the ZEROe roadmap or the CityAirbus NextGen.

show more show less Energy is central to how we transform the aeronautics industry to achieve our decarbonisation ambition by 2050. The transformation follows two axes: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use increase and new electrical sources (battery and fuel cell). Hybridisation makes use of different energy sources. This combination helps optimise the overall energy efficiency of a flight and reduce fuel consumption.

Aircraft hybridisation principles In a hybrid configuration, the aircraft uses several energy sources in flight, either in tandem or alternately. The combination of energy sources - jet fuel or sustainable aviation fuels with electricity - enables us to optimise overall energy efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. Hybridisation leads to better energy management with the benefits of reducing fuel consumption by up to 5% compared to a standard flight. The electrical sources could come from batteries or fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electricity. In November 2022, Airbus unveiled its fuel cell-powered engine .

In flight, the aircraft uses several energy sources, either in tandem or alternately. The combination of energy sources - jet fuel or sustainable aviation fuels with electricity - enables us to optimise overall energy efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

A timeline of achievements in electric propulsion In 2010, Airbus embarked on its electrification journey, developing the world’s first all-electric, four-engined aerobatic aircraft, CriCri. Since then, we have made significant progress in the electrification of flight thanks to our all-electric, twin-propeller aircraft E-Fan and our electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) demonstrator projects, Vahana and CityAirbus NextGen. E-Fan X, the successor to E-Fan has provided invaluable insights on serial hybrid-electric propulsion.

ASCENDing to new heights with cryogenic superconductivity - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLWFzY2VuZGluZy10by1uZXctaGVpZ2h0cy13aXRoLWNyeW9nZW5pYy1zdXBlcmNvbmR1Y3Rpdml0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ASCEND, Airbus’ superconductive powertrain demonstrator, has achieved a world first. Over the last three years, a small team of experts has developed and manufactured a cryogenic superconducting electric propulsion system purposely built to aerospace specifications.



In November 2023, ASCEND took its final step. The team successfully powered-on the 500 kilowatt powertrain at the system’s core. It’s an exciting breakthrough.

In the quest for cleaner transportation, the marriage of hydrogen-powered fuel cells and high temperature, or cryogenic, superconductivity could be a game changer.

The current density of superconducting tape is one hundred times that of a copper equivalent. Cryogenically freezing that tape enables it to carry electrical power from a fuel source to a propulsion system with practically no resistance.

That’s why, nestled inside a large warehouse just outside of Toulouse, France, Airbus UpNext’s Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental powertraiN Demonstrator (ASCEND) team has spent the last three years exploring the impact of cryogenic superconductivity on the electrical infrastructure that could power the next generation of low-carbon aircraft.

This ASCEND-built electric motor receives power from superconducting tape which experiences next to no current loss, thanks to its very low resistance at cryogenic temperatures.

ASCEND concluded in November 2023 with the successful powering-on of a 500 kilowatt powertrain, consisting of superconducting tape, a cryogenic motor control unit and cooling system, and a superconducting motor. For context, getting the equivalent of today’s city-hopping turboprops off the ground using electric power alone would require around eight megawatts.

The ASCEND powertrain drove this superconducting electric motor during a successful power-on at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System testing facility in Ottobrunn, Germany.

Based on scientific research carried out by Airbus’ Central Research & Technology, the powertrain was developed at UpNext’s headquarters near Toulouse. Then for the final stage of the project, Airbus engineers put it through its paces at Airbus’ E-Aircraft System testing centre in Ottobrunn, Germany. It’s the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Culminating in the November power-on, the tests confirmed that it is possible to develop, assemble and control a complete superconducting and cryogenics chain built to aeronautical specifications.

This successful power run – a first for cryogenic technology in aerospace – is a step closer to real-world conditions. How did the ASCEND team get here?

Superconducting technology may seem like science fiction, but it has been around for decades. Today it is mainly used in medical imagery scanners; scientific experiments requiring a high magnetic field, such as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider; or ground transportation for electricity. However, testing facilities on the open market are few and the international ecosystem is immature.

“The technology we need already exists,” says ASCEND project head Ludovic Ybanez.



Our goal wasn’t to reinvent the wheel. It was to identify the best companies and research institutes and adapt their technology for application on board aircraft. We’ve worked closely with a network of over 20 partners to design a cryogenic powertrain that improves the efficiency of the electrical system by at least 4-5%.

Ludovic Ybanez, ASCEND project head Airbus UpNext



Airbus UpNext engineer Reda Abdouh peers into an ASCEND superconducting cryogenic test bench. When the liquid nitrogen it contains is released, the sudden chill causes air around it to condense.

As Airbus’ innovation lab, UpNext does things differently. Given the freedom and flexibility of a start-up, ASCEND’s engineers – who divide their time between UpNext’s Toulouse headquarters and Ottobrunn – hand-built the test bench environments with their German colleagues.

You’ll find some of these unassuming white boxes in a small back room inside that Toulouse warehouse. While they may look simple from the outside, the boxes house complex systems.

At about a metre and a half tall and resembling an outsized domestic appliance, each of these home-made devices are where the ASCEND team test how superconducting materials perform when exposed to an aircraft’s thermal cycles. The electrical resistance of such materials becomes zero when exposed to extremely low temperatures, usually below -170°C.

That might seem very cold but liquid nitrogen, widely used in industrial processes, is around -200°C. The powertrain components are exposed to repeated extreme thermal shock tests within these environments to determine the potential impact of cryogenics on the performance of electrical propulsion systems.

The Airbus UpNext team built their own electric demonstrator motor. ASCEND has shown it is possible for a superconducting powertrain to create a major power shift in electric propulsion, from several hundred kilowatts to multi-megawatts.

Conventional electric powertrains require a high voltage to limit power loss. On board an electric aircraft, a superconductive powertrain could reduce voltage and practically eliminate losses, while keeping the weight and size of the overall system in check. The conditions for superconductivity would be created by the same cryogenic process used to maintain liquid hydrogen on board the aircraft at -253°C, where the hydrogen is used to generate power through electrolysis inside a fuel cell.

A close-up of the superconducting tape, whose current density is one hundred times that of a copper equivalent.

After a halting start, the aerospace superconductivity ecosystem is maturing. As the ASCEND chapter closes, another opens. The race is on to mature and accelerate the technology in time to meet Airbus’ ambition of flying a hydrogen fuel-cell powered aircraft by 2035.

The ASCEND team used these test benches, designed and built in-house, to test the powertrain’s components by exposing them to extreme temperature cycles.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9981635212898254}",positive,0.9981635212898254,1
The EcoPulse aircraft demonstrator makes first hybrid-electric flight - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi10aGUtZWNvcHVsc2UtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLW1ha2VzLWZpcnN0LWh5YnJpZC1lbGVjdHJpY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tarbes, France - December 5, 2023 - EcoPulse, the hybrid-electric distributed propulsion aircraft demonstrator jointly developed by Daher, Safran and Airbus to support aviation’s decarbonization roadmap, has successfully performed its first flight test in hybrid-electric mode. The demonstrator flew with its ePropellers activated, powered by a battery and a turbogenerator.

EcoPulse took off from Tarbes Airport on November 29, at 10:32 hrs CET for a test flight which lasted approximately 100 minutes. During the flight, the crew engaged the electric propellers and verified the proper functioning of the demonstrator's flight control computer, high-voltage battery pack, distributed electric propulsion and hybrid electric turbogenerator.

EcoPulse’s first hybrid flight is the culmination of several technical milestones, including extensive ground tests and 10 hours of flight tests of the aircraft with the electrical systems inactive.

“We confirmed today that this disruptive propulsion system works in flight, which paves the way for more sustainable aviation,” said Eric Dalbiès, Safran’s Executive Vice President Strategy and Chief Technology Officer. “The lessons learned from upcoming flight tests will feed into our technology roadmap and strengthen our position as leader in future all-electric and hybrid-electric propulsive systems.”

“This is a major milestone for our industry and we’re proud to have powered the EcoPulse demonstrator first flight with our new battery systems,” said Sabine Klauke, Chief Technical Officer at Airbus. High-energy density batteries will be necessary to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, whether for light aircraft, advanced air mobility or large hybrid-electric aircraft. Projects like EcoPulse are key to accelerating progress in electric and hybrid electric flight, and a cornerstone of our aim to decarbonize the aerospace industry as a whole.”

“The flight campaign will give Daher invaluable data on the effectiveness of the onboard technologies, including distributed propulsion, high-voltage batteries and hybrid-electric propulsion,” commented Pascal Laguerre, Chief Technology Officer at Daher. “We’re working to converge practical and significant know-how on design, certification and operation to shape our path toward more sustainable aircraft for the future.”

Unveiled at the 2019 Paris Air Show, EcoPulse is one of the major collaborative projects in Europe in the field of aviation decarbonization. It is supported by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council), and co-funded by DGAC (the French Civil Aviation Authority) through France Relance (the French government’s economy recovery plan) and NextGeneration EU. The demonstrator aims to evaluate the operational advantages of integrating hybrid-electric distributed propulsion, with specific emphasis on CO 2 emissions and noise level reduction. This disruptive propulsion architecture enables a single independent electrical source to power several engines distributed throughout the aircraft.

Based on a Daher TBM aircraft platform, EcoPulse is equipped with six integrated electric thrusters or e-Propellers (supplied by Safran), distributed along the wings. Its propulsion system integrates two power sources: a turbogenerator, i.e. an electric generator driven by a gas turbine (supplied by Safran), and a high-energy density battery pack (supplied by Airbus). At the heart of this architecture is a Power Distribution and Rectifier Unit (PDRU), responsible for protecting the high-voltage network and for distributing the available electrical power, as well as high-voltage power harnesses (both provided by Safran). The battery pack designed by Airbus is rated at 800 Volts DC and can deliver up to 350 kilowatts of power. The demonstrator also benefits from the aerodynamic and acoustic integration expertise of the European aircraft manufacturer. Airbus also developed the Flight Control Computer permitting aircraft maneuvers using the ePropellers, and synchrophasing to support future aircraft acoustic recommendations.

Note: the Ecopulse aircraft demonstrator will be showcased during the Green Aero Days organized in Pau (France) on December 6-7, 2023.

About Elixir aircraft

Elixir Aircraft, a company based in La Rochelle with more than 80 employees, was created in 2015 to meet the challenges of the French light aviation sector. The objective of the French SME: to make safer, more economical, more environment-friendly and more versatile aircraft. Complexity is the current reason why older generation aircraft suffer from failures (technical or human) and are expensive to operate (fuel consumption and maintenance). Elixir Aircraft employs a technology from the world of competitive sailing, the Oneshot Carbon, to simplify the structures. More simplicity means fewer failures, therefore more safety, but also fewer maintenance, and lower costs (estimates of 40€/h of fuel and maintenance). At the end of 2021, Elixir Aircraft opened a new production site in order to internalize the entire production of carbon parts. Find out more at https://elixir-aircraft.com/en/

After initial preparation the panels will be dispatched to other Airbus sites before final integration and testing at Friedrichshafen. The Galileo G2 satellites are scheduled for launch in the coming years to support the initial deployment and validation of the G2 System.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, said: “After the successful design phase we are now kicking off production in earnest of the state-of-the-art Galileo G2 satellites. Our teams in Friedrichshafen are working with engineers across Europe to meet the challenging schedule and finalise these sophisticated satellites which will further improve the global Galileo system opening up even more opportunities for services on Earth.”

To meet the demanding schedule to deliver all six satellites in less than two years, Airbus has developed a coordinated production programme to leverage the spacecraft manufacturing, integration, and testing expertise across Airbus sites including Backnang (near Stuttgart), Friedrichshafen, Madrid, Ottobrunn (near Munich) and Toulouse. The second satellite structure is due to arrive in early 2024 and the third towards the end of next year. Airbus’ modular approach to the manufacturing of the G2 satellites will see three spacecraft being produced in parallel at any one time.

The G2 satellites will incorporate enhanced navigation antennas which will help improve accuracy of the flagship European Global Navigation Satellite System. The spacecraft, equipped with electric propulsion for the first time and higher-strength navigation antennas, will also feature fully digital payloads which will be easily reconfigured in orbit, enabling them to actively respond to the evolving needs of users with novel signals and services.

ESA's Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto said: “This new milestone is a testament to the capabilities and dedication of the European industry and reaffirms ESA’s commitment to redefine the boundaries of satellite navigation. I cannot wait to see the many parts come together to bring to life an even better performing Galileo system, so this EU programme can continue serving European and world citizens.”

The above 2 tons satellites, which benefit from Airbus’ heritage of the highly reliable Eurostar series of telecommunications satellites, will also incorporate six (rather than four) enhanced atomic clocks as well as inter-satellite links, enabling them to communicate and cross-check with one another. This is intended to offer decimetre-scale precision positioning for users around the world. They will be controllable with an increased data rate to and from the ground and equipped with advanced jamming and spoofing protection mechanisms to safeguard Galileo signals. The spacecraft will operate in orbit for 15 years.

“We are proud that the Bundeswehr has decided to order up to 82 H145M helicopters”, said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “The H145M is a robust multi-role helicopter and the German Air Force has gained a significant amount of operational experience with its H145M LUH Special Operations Forces fleet. We will ensure that the Bundeswehr receives the helicopters in accordance with the very ambitious delivery schedule which includes first deliveries in 2024 less than a year after contract signature.”



The H145M is a multi-role military helicopter that provides a broad range of mission capabilities. Within minutes, the helicopter can be reconfigured from a light attack role with axial ballistic and guided weapons and a state-of-the-art self-protection system into a special operations version including fast rappelling equipment. The comprehensive mission packages include hoisting and external cargo capabilities. Additionally, the new German H145M includes options for future mission capabilities including the ability to operate with the integration of Manned-Unmanned Teaming and upgraded data links and communication systems.



The basic version of the ordered H145Ms will be equipped with fixed provisions, including the weapon management system, HForce, developed by Airbus Helicopters. This allows the Bundeswehr to train its pilots on the same type of helicopter that is used for operation and combat. Costly type transfers are eliminated and the highest level of professionalisation will be achieved.



The H145M is the military version of the tried-and-tested, light twin-engine H145 helicopter. The global fleet of the H145 family has now accumulated more than seven million flight hours. It is used by armed and law enforcement forces around the world for the most demanding missions. The Bundeswehr already operates 16 H145M LUH SOF and 8 H145 LUH SAR helicopters. The US Army employs almost 500 helicopters from the H145 family under the name of UH-72 Lakota. Current operators of the H145M are Hungary, Serbia, Thailand and Luxembourg; Cyprus has ordered six aircraft.



Powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines, the H145M is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC). In addition, the helicopter is equipped with the Helionix digital avionics suite which, alongside innovative flight data management, includes a high-performance 4-axis autopilot, which considerably reduces pilot workload during missions. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145M the quietest helicopter in its class.

Airbus upgrades A400M firefighter prototype kit - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi1haXJidXMtdXBncmFkZXMtYTQwMG0tZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXItcHJvdG90eXBlLWtpdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getafe, Spain - 5 December 2023 – Airbus Defence and Space has conducted a new flight-test campaign of the A400M Roll-on/Roll-off firefighting prototype kit, dropping 20,000 litres of retardant and creating high concentration lines over 400 metres long on ground.

Over a period of two weeks, the A400M carried out a ground and flight-test campaign in south-western and central Spain, including six drops, three of which used red-coloured retardant and three using water.

“We have tested a new version of the kit, improving dropping efficiency and reducing discharge time by over 30% compared to last year, while combined with rapid deployment and easy installation on the A400M aircraft,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. “We continue to pioneer new solutions and capabilities for our A400M fleet, in this case protecting populations and natural environments from fires.”

An easy-to-install solution

This roll-on/roll-off kit does not require any modification to the aircraft and, therefore, is interchangeable to any aircraft in the A400M fleet. The water or retardant is stored in a tank in the cargo hold of the aircraft and, by using a mechanical lever, a door is opened to allow the liquid to flow out of the aircraft by gravity means through a discharge pipe. The current design of the prototype is capable of dropping 20,000 litres in a single discharge.

The tanks can be filled in less than 10 minutes using standard high-pressure pumps on ground. The A400M is characterised by its ability to take off and land on short and unpaved runways, and a wide range of air bases and airfields.

During the campaign, the 43rd Firefighting Squadron of the Spanish Air Force has been involved as technical advisors and assuring that this capability in the A400M has operational value for any potential operator.

In July 2022, Airbus tested a removable firefighting demonstrator kit on the A400M for the first time. The company concluded that the A400M firefighting kit offers additional capabilities not available on the market thanks to its high-dropping capacity, high manoeuvrability with the latest safety standards, day and night operation and the potential to convert any regular A400M in any fleet to a firefighting aircraft at very short notice.

What a year! Why 2023 was a record-breaker for the A320 Family - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLXdoYXQtYS15ZWFyLXdoeS0yMDIzLXdhcy1hLXJlY29yZC1icmVha2VyLWZvci10aGUtYTMyMC1mYW1pbHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A320 Family has plenty to celebrate in 2023.

By the end of November 2023, Airbus’ highly successful A320 Family had already logged 1,395 orders, including the single largest order for 500 aircraft, from Indian airline Indigo. 2023 is following a trend: in 2022, the A320 Family logged 857 orders.

The market for single-aisle aircraft has bounced back strongly from the dark days of the COVID pandemic. Airlines worldwide particularly appreciate the modern, efficient and versatile A320 Family.

In recent years the Family’s largest model, the A321neo, has been successful both in terms of volumes and speed of sales. The variant accounts for around two-thirds of the 6,739 A320 Family aircraft in Airbus’ current order book.

To keep up with such strong demand, Airbus is growing its global industrial footprint with the goal of bringing A320 Family production up to 75 aircraft per month in 2026. At the same time, the company’s single-aisle final assembly lines (FALs) are evolving to produce a mix of aircraft models with new cabin and comfort standards.

Airbus is doubling the number of FALs capable of producing the A321neo, compared to 2019. By 2026, ten A320 Family FALs around the world will be capable of producing the A321neo.

In 2023, Airbus began construction of a second FAL in Mobile (USA) and in Tianjin (China). Toulouse (France) celebrated the inauguration of a FAL dedicated to the A321neo, with a second to follow. In Hamburg (Germany), where four FALs produce all members of the A320 Family, Airbus inaugurated a dedicated hangar to equip the A321 eXtra Long Range (XLR). With all locations now capable of assembling the A321neo, Airbus’ global single-aisle footprint is truly more flexible, resilient and closer to its customers.

This incredible ramp-up expands Airbus’ industrial footprint and is made possible by the thousands of people working at production sites around the world. The company is proud of this growing, multi-cultural family that makes up #TeamAirbus and the positive local impact its presence makes.

With more than 20 Airbus sites contributing to A320 Family production, Airbus continues to grow and onboard many newcomers to join this exciting journey. The ambitious plan for 2023 is to recruit circa 13,000 employees globally and it is progressing well, confirming Airbus attractivity. In addition to the traditional industrial skills - from manufacturing engineering, structures and systems to avionics - Airbus also attracts employees to critical jobs such as quality, logistic and supply chain specialists, customer line managers or digital manufacturing and cybersecurity specialists.

This growth is a strong sign of confidence in Airbus and the aviation industry as a whole. The A320 Family contributes to making further progress towards low-carbon aviation, offering a 20% fuel burn reduction compared to previous-generation aircraft.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",positive,0.9999985694885254,1

ESA entrusts Airbus further for Earth observation standard reference TRUTHS mission - Airbus,"Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0xMi1lc2EtZW50cnVzdHMtYWlyYnVzLWZ1cnRoZXItZm9yLWVhcnRoLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLXN0YW5kYXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been awarded the latest phase in the European Space Agency (ESA) TRUTHS mission as part of ESA’s Earth Observation Earth Watch programme. The contract covers detailed definition of the mission and payload, and focuses on payload development and de-risking activities with an option for the procurement of long lead time hardware ahead of the full implementation phase following the 2025 ESA Ministerial budget meeting.

The TRUTHS satellite mission will measure the Sun’s radiation and the sunlight reflected off Earth's surface relative to an accurate reference, which will then be used to improve the climatological data sets and calibrate the observations of other satellites. This space-based climate and calibration observing system will enable data from other satellites to be compared more easily providing greater standards of data harmonisation for even more accurate climate change forecasts.

Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “This contract takes us one step closer to building a mission that will enable scientists and climatologists to cross reference their measurements and data enabling much more accurate forecasts and analysis in a shorter time. TRUTHS will provide the gold standard of calibration for space-based Earth observation – a kind of ‘standards laboratory in space’.”

UK Science, Research and Innovation Minister, Andrew Griffith, said: “This UK-led mission will have a global impact, providing invaluable measurements to improve our understanding of climate change. Overseen by Airbus-UK, this work is generating growth and developing important industrial capabilities across our space sector, driving forward our ambitions to make the UK a science and technology superpower.”

ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “We are glad to award the contract to Airbus in the UK to take their work on developing TRUTHS into the next all-important phase. We see here at COP28 that the world is committed to climate action and having reliable data on which to base decisions is of the utmost importance. TRUTHS will be used as a benchmark so that data from other satellites can be compared more easily, thereby improving reliability.”

TRUTHS stands for Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio Studies. This latest phase will include design definition of the mission and payload as well as commencing the build-up of the Industrial partners required to deliver such a complex payload while establishing optical Earth instrumentation expertise in the UK. This enhanced capability in the UK will enable Europe to benefit from a new skill set for Earth observation satellite missions in the future.

TRUTHS will carry a Cryogenic Solar Absolute Radiometer (CSAR) to provide a primary calibration standard in order to benchmark measurements of both incoming solar radiation and outgoing reflected radiation - measured with a Hyperspectral Imaging Sensor (HIS) also part of the payload - with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements will give the ability to estimate radiative imbalance underlying climate change and, importantly, in a shorter time than is currently possible. TRUTHS will serve to calibrate other satellite sensors, such as those carried on the Copernicus missions, through co-imaging operations.

TRUTHS is funded by a set of ESA member states, led by the UK, with the participation of the Czech Republic, Greece, Romania, Spain and Switzerland. Airbus is supported in the initial development of the satellite by partners including Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, Teledyne e2v, National Physical Laboratory, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Deimos Space UK Ltd and AVS-UK Ltd, Thales Alenia Space Switzerland, Deimos Space SRL, Sener, and Integrated Systems Development. Further important contributions will be made by other companies and institutes from the participating nations.

The UK has embarked on a strategy to take a leadership role in this domain building on the strong climate science expertise from among others the National Physical Laboratory, the National Centre for Earth Observation and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space.

The ensuing investigation revealed several causes of the accident. In particular, it showed that although both aircraft were equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) and that each TCAS had alerted the crew, the alerts had not prevented the disaster as the air traffic control (ATC) and TCAS instructions were different. In the absence of a clear and uniformly shared communication and procedure in the event of an alert, the human reactions had not been consistent.

This situation prompted the aeronautical industry to rethink its approach. ICAO and national airworthiness authorities decided that TCAS orders would take precedence over ATC instructions.

Airbus decided to implement an additional technical innovation. To help crews, Airbus developed the AP/FD TCAS function (Auto-Pilot/ Flight Directors – Traffic Collision Avoidance System), which enables the autopilot to automatically perform an immediate optimal avoidance manoeuvre, avoiding excessive or incorrect crew reactions.

Thanks to this system, the autopilot executes the climb or descent instructions given by the TCAS under the monitoring of the crew who can notify ATC of the manoeuvre performed and when the aircraft are “cleared of conflict”, for the utmost safety of the aircraft and its passengers.

EcoPulse demonstrator takes first flight with batteries onboard - Airbus,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTEyLWVjb3B1bHNlLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci10YWtlcy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtd2l0aC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtb25ib2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EcoPulse is a distributed hybrid-propulsion demonstrator aircraft co-developed by Airbus, Daher and Safran. Designed to learn and mature the technological bricks of hybrid-electric propulsion systems for future aircraft, EcoPulse reached a milestone when the demonstrator took off on its first test flight.

After a couple of years of travelling between Tarbes and Toulouse on a regular basis to oversee EcoPulse’s development, project leader William Llobregat found himself back onsite in November 2023 with his team, and those of Daher and Safran. The occasion? The first EcoPulse test flight. “This project was launched in 2019,” says Llobregat, a next-generation propulsion architect. “It’s really exciting to have reached the concrete stage of the project where we are flight testing the technologies we have developed.”

EcoPulse first hybrid flight test video

The first flight marks the beginning of an eight-month flight testing campaign of the distributed hybrid-propulsion systems and the associated technologies, led by Daher. A hybrid-electric propulsion system combines a high-voltage battery with a turbomachine equipped with an electrical generator, and the distributed aspect means there are multiple propulsion “pods” spread along the wings.

Hybridisation is an important investment area for Airbus as estimates show that it could reduce an aircraft’s environmental footprint up to 5%. The EcoPulse first flight, with the functional hybrid-propulsion system aboard, thus marks a major, concrete step in advancing the company’s electrification roadmap.

A milestone for hybrid-electric flight

EcoPulse took off for its inaugural test flight from the scenic Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport, nestled at the foot of the Pyrénées mountain range in southwest France. Two experimental Daher pilots were onboard the demonstrator, a modified Daher TBM 900 turboprop aircraft. While take off and landing used the traditional propulsion engine, the hybrid-propulsion system was activated at cruising altitude, where the pilots spent around 20 minutes running testing sequences on the battery while it was powering the flight.

All aspects of the different systems, from the way the aircraft responds to the way the power sources are used, were previously simulated digitally and tested by the pilots on the ground. This theoretical data can now be compared with the real flight test data to help the teams better refine the simulator and improve the performance of the different innovative technology components.

Which technology components, you may ask? Airbus, Daher and Safran divided the responsibilities of developing the different EcoPulse technologies based on their complementary expertises. Airbus’ contributions to the demonstrator are the development of the high-energy-density battery that powers the propulsors; the aerodynamic and acoustic integration of the distributed-propulsion system; and the development of a flight control computer system.

“Technological demonstrators like Ecopulse play a key role in advancing our industry's decarbonisation roadmap,” says Llobregat. “The demonstrators themselves are not intended to ever enter into service, but they allow us to evaluate, mature and validate individual technologies that can then be integrated into future aircraft.”

This voltage is a first for the aerospace industry and we hope to one day integrate this technology into commercial aircraft.

William Llobregat, EcoPulse project leader and next-generation propulsion architect

Airbus brings expertise to key EcoPulse components

Of Airbus’ three main technology contributions, the battery system may be the most groundbreaking. As automobile batteries for electric vehicles are too heavy and bulky to have aerospace uses, and those batteries already in use on aircraft are typically low-voltage, the high-voltage battery on EcoPulse had to be custom designed by Airbus Defence and Space. “The battery system is able to achieve 800 Volts DC and deliver up to 350 kilowatts of power,” says Llobregat. “We are pioneering new voltage levels for the aerospace industry and we hope to one day integrate this technology into commercial aircraft.” The battery is powerful enough to drive up to six electric propulsors.

Airbus also modified the shape of the aircraft to assess the performance impact of having a distributed propulsion system. “We have separate, smaller sources of propulsion distributed across the wing. This means that you could theoretically increase the thrust on only the outboard engines, or just the centre ones. We can then assess how these differences impact flight performance, which is very valuable data,” explains Llobregat. “Using asymmetrical thrust to control the aircraft is a totally new technology that is only possible to test out because we are using an electrical system that has better dynamic response than traditional jet fuel engines.

The creation of a flight control computer system also fell to Airbus. The software links all the flight control systems and connects them to the electrical engines, monitoring the propulsion. It optimises thrust and minimises the wingtip drag effect, and it also takes into account an extra control stick in the cockpit as well as an emergency shutdown button that immediately returns the demonstrator to a normal aircraft with a native engine.

Laying the groundwork for battery-powered flight

Flight testing of the demonstrator will last until mid-2024 at the latest, and will include up to 30 test flights. The ultimate goal for the teams involved? That each company will walk away from the project having achieved their respective objectives. “This partnership between Airbus, Daher and Safran – three French companies – worked so well because it was founded on our common ambition of paving the path to decarbonisation for the European aerospace industry,” Llobregat says.

As one of Airbus’ primary project objectives was testing a new high-voltage battery configuration in flight, the testing campaign is the exciting result of four years of work. However, the development of the battery system stretches back even further, with the EcoPulse battery benefiting from several years of previous research and prototyping at Airbus and Airbus Helicopters. The flight testing of this state-of-the-art battery system – lightweight and compact, with high voltage and energy density – will provide valuable data to support Airbus’ goal of applying hybrid propulsion systems to future aircraft or helicopters. While EcoPulse may be a small aircraft, its potential impact on the aviation industry is therefore huge!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9940972328186035}",neutral,0.9940972328186035,0

CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL set to power on - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eWFpcmJ1cy1uZXh0Z2VuLWV2dG9sLXNldC10by1wb3dlci1vbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With an operational range of 80 km and a cruise speed of 120 km/h, the CityAirbus NextGen has been developed to be suited for a range of deployments in urban areas and beyond. Airbus Image

Airbus is expecting to power on its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL prototype before the end of the year, with the aircraft in the final stages of assembly at Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Donauworth, Germany.

“It’s now out of the jig — it’s on skids, the wing, tail, and propellers are there, and the battery pack has arrived,” Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, told Vertical. “Literally every day there’s something new coming in.”

The CityAirbus NextGen program was launched in 2021, following on from Airbus’s CityAirbus and Vahana demonstration programs. The aircraft is powered by eight propellers and 16 electrical power units, with dual systems for redundancy. It will carry one pilot with three passengers in a banked seat at the rear of the cabin.

The multi-rotor aircraft has been in assembly throughout 2023 in preparation for the start of its flight test campaign in 2024. The first phases of this campaign will take place in a 10,700-square-foot (1,000-square-meter) dedicated eVTOL test center in Donauworth, which itself has been built over the year.

The ability to begin the campaign indoors will ensure against any weather-related challenges that would otherwise be presented by the German winter, said Sarihan.

“Then we continue to open up the flight test envelope as you would expect us to do on any other product,” she said.

In addition to a main hangar, the test center includes separate rooms for subsystem testing. The grand opening of the facility will be held “sometime in the new year,” said Sarihan, along with a first public display of the prototype.

The flight test campaign is due to take place throughout 2024, in parallel with the maturation of various technologies set to be incorporated into the aircraft, such as the “Millennium” single stick control and Vertex autonomy system.

“This parallel path really saves us quite a lot of time and investment,” said Sarihan.

Airbus has been clear from the outset that its plan is to enter the eVTOL market with a piloted product, but the initial test phase of CityAirbus NextGen will be remotely piloted.

In addition to the flight test campaign, the upcoming year will see Airbus continue working on the broader eVTOL ecosystem.

The company has partnered with 30 organizations and companies — including the state and federal government, technology companies, universities and Munich airport — to establish what it calls the Air Mobility Initiative (AMI) in Bavaria. Together, they’re developing and testing a full urban air mobility ecosystem, from defining a concept of operations (ConOps), to building the first version of a vertiport.

“We will actually start to fly subscales in the exact missions of the eVTOL next year,” said Sarihan. “This will be the first test of the ConOps’ design.”

The company also expects to build upon its existing pool of global partnerships, having already announced agreements with Chilean operator Ecocopter, Saudi Arabia’s The Helicopter Company, and Japanese operator Hiratagakuen to better understand the urban air mobility markets in those regions.

Earlier this year, Airbus announced a partnership with the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation to explore the use of CityAirbus NextGen in the emergency medical services (EMS) mission.

“What we’re working on is not only how they would like the aircraft to evolve in future generations, but how an eVTOL will fit into an existing working HEMS system,” said Sarihan.

Early discussions with the foundation showed that they think eVTOLs might best be used to deliver medical care rather than to transport patients, she revealed.

“[For the foundation], the interest of the eVTOL is in rapid deployment of the right medication, right personnel and the right intervention,” she said. “It’s not replacing [helicopters or ground ambulances], but it’s providing an extra layer of service.”

While 2024 will be another year of major development for the CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL, it will also be a momentous year for the wider eVTOL industry, with fellow manufacturer Volocopter aiming to launch commercial services in Paris at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Sarihan said Airbus will be watching with great interest.

“All of this puts a lot of attention, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy and some funding as well [towards the eVTOL sector],” she said. “But we also have to make sure that all of these [commercial launches] are executed really, really well. Everybody wants it to go smoothly, to go safely, to excite the public to show the first demonstration, and then keep them with us for the next step.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",neutral,0.9999970197677612,0
Lufthansa Group joins Airbus' carbon-removal initiative - Lufthansa Group,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20ubHVmdGhhbnNhZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VuL0x1ZnRoYW5zYS1Hcm91cC1qb2lucy1BaXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lufthansa Group signed a contract with Airbus on the pre-purchase of verified and durable carbon-removal credits of 40,000 tonnes of CO₂. A promising solution for reducing CO₂ in the atmosphere, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) technology filters CO₂ from the air and stores it permanently. The Lufthansa Group began exploring this innovative process at an early stage and deems it perfectly complementing the Group’s sustainability strategy.

The carbon-removal credits will be issued by Airbus through its ACCO (Airbus Carbon Capture Offer) service. The certificates will be available from 2026 and an annual purchase of carbon-removal credits of 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ has been agreed on over a period of four years. The signing of the contract follows a joint declaration of intent from 2022.

“The Lufthansa Group is strongly committed to making air transport more sustainable and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This includes billion-euro investments in continuous fleet modernization and our strong commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Technical CO₂ removal solutions, like advanced and direct carbon capture and storage processes, will play a complementary role in achieving our decarbonization goals,” said Caroline Drischel, Head of Corporate Responsibility at the Lufthansa Group.

“The Lufthansa Group was one of the very first aviation companies to work with Airbus to explore the potential of direct air carbon capture and storage solutions,” said Nicolas Chrétien, Head of Environment & Sustainability at Airbus. “As the aviation industry moves towards net zero CO₂-emissions by 2050, carbon removal will play an important role in addressing remaining emissions. We are very pleased to go one step further with the Lufthansa Group and keep up the momentum to make decarbonized air travel a reality.”

This is how DACCS technology works

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage is a high-potential technology that involves filtering CO₂ emissions directly from the air using high powered fans. Once removed from the air, the CO₂ is stored deep underground in geologic saline formations. As the aviation industry cannot capture CO₂ emissions released into the atmosphere at source, a direct air carbon capture and storage solution would allow the sector to extract CO₂ emissions from its operations directly from atmospheric air. In addition to the comprehensive measures that companies are taking to reduce CO₂ emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon removal is required to support the achievement of net-zero targets.

Additionally, the Direct Air Carbon Capture technology will be an important building block for the production of next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. For SAF production from renewable energies with the innovative Power-to-Liquid or Sun-to-Liquid technologies, for example, CO₂ is captured from the atmosphere and processed further. For this, a Direct Air Capture infrastructure will be needed. In IATA’s Infrastructure Roadmap, the development and the promised success of SAF are closely linked to the adoption of Direct Air Capture infrastructures. The Lufthansa Group is involved in numerous initiatives to bring these promising next generation SAF technologies to market maturity.

The Airbus carbon-removal initiative is based on Airbus’ partnership with 1PointFive that includes the pre-purchase of carbon-removal credits of 400,000 tonnes of CO₂ to be delivered over four years. The US-based company is working closely with leading organizations to develop practical pathways to achieve global climate targets.

Lufthansa Group pursues ambitious sustainability goals

The Lufthansa Group has set itself ambitious climate protection goals and aims to achieve a neutral CO₂ balance by 2050. Already by 2030, the Lufthansa Group wants to halve its net CO₂ emissions compared to 2019 through reduction and compensation measures. The reduction share of the 2030 target was validated by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in August 2022. The Lufthansa Group was the first airline group in Europe with a science-based CO₂ reduction target in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. For effective climate protection, the Lufthansa Group is focusing, in particular, on accelerated fleet modernization, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the continuous optimization of flight operations, and offers for its private travelers and corporate customers to make a flight or the transport of cargo more sustainable. In addition, the Lufthansa Group has been actively supporting global climate and weather research for many years. The Lufthansa Group's commitment to sustainability is rated positively and above the industry average by independent rating organizations.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7624185085296631}",positive,0.7624185085296631,1
Germany spends $2.3 billion on Airbus light attack helicopters - Defense News,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTIvMTQvZ2VybWFueS1zcGVuZHMtMjMtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1haXJidXMtbGlnaHQtYXR0YWNrLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — The German Defence Ministry has signed a contract with Airbus for 62 H145M light attack helicopters, with a portion of the fleet equipped to fight tanks from afar — a direct lesson from the fighting in Ukraine.

Under the order, 57 of the aircraft will go to the Army and five to Air Force special operations forces. Twenty more are envisioned under a future option, Airbus Helicopters said in a Dec. 14 statement. Deliveries will begin in 2024, according to the vendor.

German lawmakers approved the requisite funding request of €2.1 billion (U.S. $2.3 billion) on Dec. 13. All aircraft will be capable of carrying an armaments package that is slated to include the Spike LR guided anti-tank missile, but only 24 will initially be set up to that end, according to parliamentary defense sources in Berlin that spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic.

The purchase, including the envisioned anti-tank capabilities, comes against the backdrop of new insights into the requirement for standoff capabilities when countering tanks. In Ukraine, Russian helicopters were able to pick off Ukrainian armored vehicles by firing their missiles from a safe distance.

The latest version of the Spike LR missile, an Israeli design marketed by Eurospike in Europe, can reach targets 10 kilometers (6 miles) away when fired from helicopters, according to the manufacturer.

“We will ensure that the Bundeswehr [German military] receives the helicopters in accordance with the very ambitious delivery schedule which includes first deliveries in 2024 less than a year after contract signature,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

The new helicopters are slated to replace Germany’s fleet of Tiger choppers. Despite the hefty buy, defense officials consider the H145M fleet a “bridging solution” until a new generation of drones and loitering munitions are ready for fielding in the longer term.

The H145M is a military-specific derivative of a family of helicopters also available to the law enforcement market. The German military already operates 24 of the twin-engine aircraft for special operations as well as search and rescue missions, an Airbus statement read. The U.S. Army’s 500-strong fleet of Lakota light utility helicopters is based on the same design.

Airbus Photo

Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters, has provided more details about the company’s groundbreaking single stick control system, recently tested on the manufacturer’s FlightLab demonstrator.

Dubbed the “Millennium stick” by Airbus engineers, the system replaces the three conventional pilot controls — cyclic, collective and pedals — with a single stick that can be operated with one hand.

The idea is to allow for a simplification of piloting and control of all aircraft axes. With the single Millennium stick, pilots can perform all required maneuvers — from takeoffs, climbs and accelerations, to decelerations, turns, descents and landings.

Krysinski described the stick as allowing “control by objective.”

“You fix the objective: If you want to go forwards, the computer . . . adds on all the controls the appropriate inputs to go forward [while maintaining straight and level flight],” he told Vertical. “If you want to go up, it’s exactly the same. It makes the control of the aircraft much easier.”

A close-up view of the controller has not been provided by Airbus, and Krysinski would not go into specifics as to how it looks, but said “it’s been done very naturally.”

He said many pilots within Airbus have had the opportunity to test the system out during trials, providing crucial feedback as to how they felt using the Millenium stick both in terms of comfort and ease of use.

“What we noticed is that pilots get familiar with it very, very easily,” said Krysinski.

In addition to simplifying piloting, the Millennium stick also takes up less room in the cockpit, resulting in the added benefit of improved visibility.

The test system in FlightLab used electric actuators to pull the flight controls of the modified H130. In case of any issue, a safety pilot in the aircraft had the ability to switch to a traditional flight control system with the push of a button.

The system is reliant on information gathered by the suite of sensors FlightLab carries, including a gyro-stablized camera for image detection (known as the eye for autonomous guidance and landing extension, or EAGLE), and two lidars.

“Helicopters, for years, were very focused on the vehicle,” said Krysinski. “The pilot has all the information about what is going on with the engines, avionics and the [aircraft’s] position. Now, the focus with this new generation of sensors — the lidars, radars, cameras, [and] numerical maps — is what is going on outside.”

Regarding the future use of the technology, Krysinski said its development has mainly been driven by the company’s need for a simplified control system for its urban air mobility efforts (currently focused on the CityAirbus NextGen demonstrator).

As to whether future “traditional” rotorcraft could see a new control interface, Krysinski said the Millennium stick was simply one of several “technobricks” in development — and its uptake depends on the appetite of the company’s program teams, which in turn is informed by market considerations.

The trails of the Millennium stick were followed by tests of Airbus’s Vertex autonomy system, which saw pilots controlling the aircraft with a tablet. With the tablet, pilots simply need to input where they want to go and tap their approval for different phases of flight. They can leave the aircraft to manage the rest, from takeoff to landing — or adjust various paramenters, such as speed, altitude, or route. The aircraft will accommodate these as long as it is safe to do so.

“Also, if you have for instance some kind of a failure — whatever it is — the system automatically shows to the pilot their landing area and the aircraft lands automatically in this area, taking the appropriate trajectory,” said Krysinski.

During the tests, Airbus has had the chance to put a sense-and-avoid function through its paces. This system works by automatically detecting obstacles using the aircraft’s lidars and a map database.

“It’s experimental, of course, but really we did it deliberately to open new mission capabilities,” said Krysinski. “We will not replace the pilot — that’s not the target. The target is to make the pilot focus really on the mission and replace effort to make piloting the aircraft easier.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9968171715736389}",neutral,0.9968171715736389,0
Trapp aiming to make Airbus Helicopters' customer support best in industry - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdHJhcHAtYWltaW5nLXRvLW1ha2UtYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWN1c3RvbWVyLXN1cHBvcnQtYmVzdC1pbi1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Romain Trapp has been working as EVP of customer support and services at Airbus Helicopters since Sept. 1, 2023.

Romain Trapp, Airbus Helicopters’ newly-appointed executive vice-president of customer support and services, is refreshingly candid when discussing the challenge before him and the manufacturer. He is also unflinchingly ambitious in terms of setting targets.

“Airbus is known for having great products, pioneering . . . our DNA is to innovate, to improve our products every time,” he told Vertical. “We are not known for offering the best service. Why? I’m shooting for the moon here, and this is what I want to target. It is going to take a lot of time, because we are not where we need to be.”

Trapp started in the role Sept. 1, after spending 15 years working for Airbus in North America. There, he worked as chief financial officer at the U.S. subsidiary, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (AHI), then as president of Airbus Helicopters Canada, and finally as president of AHI and head of the North America region.

When he started his tenures as president of the Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries, he made it a priority each time to hit the road and meet as many of the manufacturer’s customers as possible, as soon as possible. It’s a trick he’s repeating now he’s back in France at the company’s rotary-wing headquarters.

The week before sitting down with Vertical at European Rotors in Madrid, Spain, Trapp was in Malaysia speaking with customers from across southeast Asia. The following week he was due to meet customers in India.

“I want to make sure I meet and create this human contact with all our customers,” he said. “That’s key for me also to understand the differences — the differences in culture, the differences in the way they operate the helicopters — which exist from one region to another.”

Support and services represents about 50 percent of Airbus Helicopters’ turnover, and employs about 5,000 people. When not on the road meeting customers over the last three months, he has been busy meeting his team. “I’ve not met all 5,000 people yet, but I’m working towards that,” he said with a smile.

In discussing the challenges his team are facing, he said the state of the supply chain remains the major issue for the entire aerospace industry, with Airbus Helicopters no exception.

While the manufacturer has invested €400 million over the last three years in additional stock and materials, issues remain with “a few critical parts” Trapp said.

To combat this, Airbus has a team of 20 people working full-time at supplier facilities to help increase production. And, with some suppliers — such as German dynamic component manufacturer ZF Luftfahrttechnik — Airbus has gone one step further to control the flow of parts by purchasing the supplier themselves and making them a wholly owned subsidiary.

Perhaps one of the more eye-catching methods the airframer is using to enhance its supply of parts is a program that sees it offer to buy used aircraft in order to part them out. Over the last year, it has bought back 20 helicopters through this program — known as Phenics — and Trapp said Airbus was targeting the purchase of “at least” 30 used helicopters next year. These 30 aircraft, he said, represent about 3,000 parts, which will be used to increase the pool of spares for customer support.

The types Airbus has purchased to date span the breadth of its fleet, including H120s, H135s, H155s and H225s.

Trapp said he hopes to raise awareness of the program, as many customers appear unaware that it exists. To take part, customers simply have to contact the manufacturer to gauge their interest. But, as Trapp said, there “has to be a business case” for aircraft to be accepted.

“For instance, a helicopter which is 10 years old — there is no business case. There is no value in it [for the program],” he said. “The parts we harvest have to be of some value, either by themselves, or because they’re part of something bigger that we require.”

Another major market trend is an uptick in the number of customers signing up for HCare — Airbus’s support-by-the-hour program, in which operators pay a fee per flight hour to guarantee a certain level of parts availability and maintenance support.

“These parts-by-the-hour contracts are a means for operators to secure their ability to perform their missions,” said Trapp. “It’s a commitment from us, the manufacturer, to provide parts and repair when the customer needs it.”

He said the uptake of these contracts was strongest among operators flying H135s and heavier types, and was proving particularly popular among those working in the air medical and utility sectors.

The wider aerospace industry has placed a focus on increased digitalization over the last few years, offering operators greater convenience and easier access to the tools and information they need to do their jobs. Trapp said over 1,200 helicopters from the Airbus global fleet are now fully connected in terms of data transfer to the manufacturer.

“The goal of digitalization, of connected services — whatever the word we want to use — is to allow operators to fly more and safer . . . using all this data from Airbus Helicopters,” he said.

However, he also cautioned that it was important to retain the human element in interactions between manufacturer and customer.

“We are a people-to-people industry, and sometimes digitalization can give the feeling that there is nobody in front of you,” he said. “It’s very important that we continue creating a very strong link between our operators and maintaining the human contact. Digitalization is a tool — it’s nothing else. It’s a tool to make your work more efficient, but the human contact part is fundamental.”

Training services also fall under Trapp’s responsibility, and he said digitalization has a role to play in bringing greater proximity to the company’s customers. The company is also embracing new training technology, such as virtual reality flight simulators, to help improve access for its customers. After signing a partnership agreement with Loft Dynamics, Airbus has deployed 15 of its virtual reality simulators around the world — some at its own facilities, and others bought directly by customers.

“We need to find ways to train more people, and for that you need to bring tools closer to the customer,” said Trapp. “A virtual reality simulator is a way to train — it’s not the only one and it’s not enough on its own — it has to be complimentary within flight training. But it’s a good first step.”

Looking ahead, Trapp said the only way to achieve his aim of having Airbus become known for the best customer service was through disruption.

He said the traditional approach to solving a problem is to launch a wide variety of actions — but said the more actions you take, the less effective they tend to be, as they simply spread the effort too thinly.

“I want us to focus on what really brings the difference, and I’m never looking at a five percent improvement or a 10 percent improvement,” said Trapp. “What I’m asking the team is, ‘Let’s bring ideas that are disruptive ideas, that can bring a 50 percent improvement.’

“When you say that to someone, of course the first reaction is, ‘OK, this guy is dreaming.’ And then the second reaction is, ‘Well, let’s think outside the box.’ ”

Reflecting on the path ahead, Trapp said it was an exciting opportunity. “It’s a great challenge — and I love a challenge.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997760653495789}",neutral,0.9997760653495789,0

Around 100 Airbus employees fall ill after company Christmas party - CNN,"Sun, 24 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8yNC9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXNpY2stY2hyaXN0bWFzLWx1bmNoL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzEyLzI0L2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtc2ljay1jaHJpc3RtYXMtbHVuY2g?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

A holiday celebration for employees of an Airbus subsidiary in France took a turn for the worse earlier this month as dozens of employees became sick after a company Christmas party.

“Around 100 Airbus Atlantic employees were taken ill after contracting a food-borne illness after eating the company-organized Christmas lunch,” a spokesperson for the European aeronautics company said in an emailed statement to CNN.

The spokesperson did not specify the type of food.

Nobody at Airbus was rendered seriously ill by the December 15 incident, and all employees were back at work by the next Monday, according to the spokesperson.

Airbus Atlantic, established in January 2022, is a wholly owned Airbus subsidiary specializing in airplane seats. Airbus Atlantic has 13,000 employees in five countries, though the ill-fated Christmas lunch occurred in France.

French health authorities are leading an investigation into the illness outbreak, the Airbus spokesperson said.

“This appears to be an isolated event and all employees are recovering well,” the Airbus spokesperson added. “The health of our employees remains our primary concern and we are fully cooperating with the ARS health agency to identify the cause of the illness and ensure this cannot happen again in the future.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5159269571304321}",neutral,0.5159269571304321,0

Airbus delivered the C295 MSA multirole surveillance aircraft earlier this year.

The aircraft were delivered to the Irish Air Corps (IAC), a division of the Irish Defence Forces focused on the Military Air Defence of Ireland airspace and supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Airbus C295 MSA with the fully integrated terminal was showcased earlier this year at the Paris Air Show before it was delivered to the Irish Defence Forces.

The aircraft are equipped with Viasat’s GAT-5530 terminal, which supports Ku- and Ka-bands, including 3.5GHz of commercial and military Ka-band. They are now equipped with Viasat broadband satcom service, which will support a range of command, control and communication (C3) mission needs from tactical transport of troops and supplies to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).

Viasat has a contract with the IAC to provide a managed satcom service across multiple aircraft which includes the C295 MSA’s and a small fleet of PC-12 special mission aircraft.

“By combining our expertise with Airbus, we aim to enhance the operational capability, flexibility, and reliability of aircraft communications systems for military users. Our focus is on delivering secure, resilient, and scalable broadband satcom connectivity that is crucial for modern mission success,” commented Victor Farah, vice president of Viasat Government Systems.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9869974851608276}",neutral,0.9869974851608276,0
Airbus’s New Hybrid-Electric Aircraft Just Completed Its First Flight - Robb Report,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1lY29wdWxzZS1haXJjcmFmdC1oeWJyaWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h0LTEyMzU0NDg0MjYv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLWVjb3B1bHNlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWh5YnJpZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1mbGlnaHQtMTIzNTQ0ODQyNi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’s innovative hybrid plane is up, up, and away.

The EcoPulse recently completed its first flight test in hybrid-electric mode, marking a significant step toward the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

The aircraft departed France’s Tarbes Airport just after 10 a.m. on November 29 and flew for approximately 100 minutes, according to a statement shared by the aerospace giant on December 5. The EcoPulse has completed extensive ground tests and 10 hours of flight tests, but the electrical systems were always inactive. This recent jaunt is proof that the hybrid propulsion system works in flight.

“This is a major milestone for our industry, and we’re proud to have powered the EcoPulse demonstrator’s first flight with our new battery systems,” Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke said in a statement.

Unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2019, the EcoPulse was developed by Airbus, Daher, and Safran to reduce carbon emissions and lower noise levels. Based on a Daher TBM aircraft, the newcomer is equipped with six electric thrusters (or e-Propellers) on the wings. Each one is driven by an electric Safran engine rated at 50 kW.

The pilots on the EcoPulse’s first hybrid-electric flight.

The propulsion system combines two power sources: a turbogenerator (an electric generator driven by a gas turbine) that was supplied by Safran and a 800 V battery pack that was supplied by Airbus and can deliver up to a 350 kW. In addition, a Power Distribution and Rectifier Unit (PDRU) protects the high-voltage network and distributes the available power.

The demonstrator is fitted with acoustic monitors that measure noise levels so that the team can make refinements to future designs if needed. Airbus has also developed an advanced flight control computer system that will allow pilots to carry out maneuvers using the ePropellers.

“High-energy density batteries will be necessary to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, whether for light aircraft, advanced air mobility, or large hybrid-electric aircraft,” adds Klauke. “Projects like EcoPulse are key to accelerating progress in electric and hybrid electric flight, and a cornerstone of our aim to decarbonize the aerospace industry as a whole.”

The team says lessons learned from upcoming flight tests will feed into their technology roadmap and help them to create more sustainable aircraft for the future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9972264170646667}",neutral,0.9972264170646667,0
France Funds Research Into Conventional A320neo Successor - Aviation Week,"Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9mcmFuY2UtZnVuZHMtcmVzZWFyY2gtY29udmVudGlvbmFsLWEzMjBuZW8tc3VjY2Vzc29y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June 2023, Airbus Group CEO Guillaume Faury opened a second avenue for Airbus. He told Aviation Week that work had begun on a more conventional successor for the A320-neo family, a project known internally as eAction. The aircraft is intended to complement Airbus’ ZEROe hydrogen project. Now eAction is gaining momentum, with the French government agreeing to a first round of research support.

France has committed €300 million ($330 million) to research and development support per year in 2024-27. By contrast, public support for startup companies working on electric or hydrogen propulsion is limited to a €65 million envelope.

The difference in resource allocation calls into question the realism of Airbus’ hydrogen project, which French ministries describe as involving an extended time frame. The principle of funding large, profit-making corporations such as Airbus and Safran may also create some unease. Some suppliers complain they too often see little, if any, of the money. Moreover, aerospace research center ONERA has proved its worth and yet receives comparatively modest government resources. In 2022, it was given a €111 million subsidy within a total budget of €277 million.

The funding at least shows how important Airbus is for the French government. The aerospace sector, largely driven by the Toulouse-based airframer, was the No. 1 contributor to the country’s trade balance in 2022.

Nevertheless, state support might raise new issues after a 2021 deal that settled a longstanding transatlantic trade dispute concerning Airbus’ and Boeing’s public funding. The accord created a framework for research and development funding. Both the U.S. and the EU agreed to support their respective manufacturers financially in a transparent way. Aircraft import tariffs were suspended for five years while a working group was tasked with finding a permanent solution.

“We need to find acceptable mechanisms to incentivize private sector investment and share risks with governments in order to support the design and development of new aircraft programs that will deliver the decarbonization of aerospace,” Faury told the Financial Times Dec. 3.

“We need a new generation of planes,” the Airbus CEO told Aviation Week in June. “We are preparing all the technologies for the plane, the production system, the digitalization of the plane and for using data to be able to fly the planes better. We have to be at 100% of [sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)] or close to 100% of SAF by 2050, not only technically but commercially as well. [This means having] planes that can fly economically under these conditions. We need aircraft that burn around 20-25% less fuel than what we are using today with the A320neo or the A321neo. That’s why we are preparing entry into service in the second half of next decade targeting 2035, maybe between 2035 and 2040.”

The decisions were made public after a Dec. 15 meeting of the French Civil Aviation Research Council (CORAC), which met to align the sector’s research and technology, an industry ministry staffer explained. “OEMs are setting the tone for future aircraft,” he said.

Research and technology are now clearly directed toward the A320’s successor. “Our priority is the ultraefficient aircraft,” a transport ministry staffer said. The annual €300 million will support “breakthrough technologies including engines,” she noted. The CFM International Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan demonstrator on which Safran and GE are working may benefit, she added.

As for propulsion, Airbus is “working very closely with CFM to look at all the dimensions of flight or integration—of performance, of certification and so on—to decide whether [RISE] is a viable option or not,” she said.

“Our teams believe it is likely to be viable, but there are still a number of boxes that need to be ticked,” Faury said in June. “We will be flight-testing the open alternative and working a lot on simulation and computation with CFM to look at all the dimensions of what it has to deliver. But yes, we consider it to be a promising technology.”

The French government is also putting time pressure on Airbus: “Our objective is that the sector moves into production mode by 2030,” the transport ministry staffer said. “The technology readiness level should be high enough—the technology may not be entirely mature, but we should be confident a development can be completed. CORAC’s goal is to help maturation.”

Hydrogen needs more time, the transport ministry staffer said. “It is even more of a breakthrough—the [technology readiness level] is even lower and even more steps are required,” she noted. Airbus, however, has long referred to 2035 as the service-entry year for a zero-emission aircraft powered by hydrogen, using either gas turbines or fuel cells.

Devised for smaller companies, a second, €65 million call for projects is being launched. “It is dedicated to emerging projects and airframers, typically startup companies working on electric or hydrogen propulsion,” the industry ministry staffer said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997472167015076}",neutral,0.9997472167015076,0
Airbus selects Kenya for the 1st HAPS drone hub – SatNews - SatNews,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzA4L2FpcmJ1cy1zZWxlY3RzLWtlbnlhLWZvci10aGUtMXN0LWhhcHMtZHJvbmUtaHViL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AALTO HAPS Ltd. aims to deploy its Zephyr aircraft that can stay aloft for days at a time from four or five bases around the world, starting with the operational hub in Laikipia County in Kenya early next year, according to the company’s CEO.

However, this plan is subject to regulatory approvals from the Kenyan government. This development could bring about a significant boost to the local economy by potentially creating up to 1,000 job opportunities for Kenyan residents.

These high-altitude drones, operating in the stratosphere between 10 to 50 kilometers, have the capability to act as mobile signal masts and attract telecommunication companies as key users.

After thorough consideration, Airbus selected Kenya as the preferred hub for this groundbreaking initiative due to several favorable factors. The country offers the ideal combination of optimal weather conditions for launching and landing the aircraft, business-friendly practices, a substantial talent pool, and quick licensing processes.

Mr. Halawi, the company’s CEO, while emphasizing the significance of this milestone project, stated that Airbus plans to establish four to five hubs worldwide to serve the global market. Each hub will encompass various units, including launch and landing ports, maintenance facilities, assembly lines with a production capacity of up to 50 aircraft per year, an operations center, and customer support facilities.

A crucial aspect that makes Kenya stand out as a hub is its ability to launch and land these high-altitude drones for up to 10 months annually. Consequently, the country is slated to host the majority of launches and landings, further solidifying its position in the aerospace industry.

Furthermore, the Zephyr aircraft developed by Airbus over the past two decades brings a new dimension to the aerial landscape. With its unique ability to land and take off in a corkscrew motion and remain airborne for more than 30 days, the Zephyr HAPS has enormous potential. It weighs 75 kilograms, boasts a wingspan of 25 meters, and can serve multiple purposes such as security observation, border security, mob

As this groundbreaking initiative takes shape, Kenya stands to benefit from becoming a pioneering force in HAPS commercial and technical regulations, potentially paving the way for accelerated industrialization of the sector throughout the decade.

Airbus recognizes Kenya’s language capabilities and favorable time zone as advantages that would enable them to establish the program’s main customer care in the country.

With this next-generation technology and strategic collaboration, Kenya is on the brink of a new era in high-altitude communication drones, ushering in unparalleled opportunities for economic growth and technological advancement.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",positive,0.9999995231628418,1
"Collaboration is key with supply chain, says Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8xMi9jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLWlzLWtleS13aXRoLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1zYXlzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton

Dec. 12, 2023, © Leeham News: The aerospace supply chain still hasn’t fully recovered the COVID-19 pandemic. All aerospace manufacturers are affected, as are the supplier to the suppliers.

At the annual Aviation Forum last week in Hamburg, Germany, Airbus said collaboration is one of the keys to recovery.

Jürgen Westermeier, the chief procurement officer (CPO) at Airbus, said “unlocking the power of collaboration” means “great things happen when we work together.

“This has been illustrated in the past, when we had to face a situation of crisis together. In the past, in the face of a crisis, collaboration has been key,” Westermeier said.

There have been first-hand a series of successive crises which radically reshaped the aerospace sector. “Be it in an unprecedented global pandemic, geopolitical events, the likes the world hasn’t seen in a long time, and a climate emergency that no one can ignore anymore. Several suppliers entered the COVID period with weak financials.”

In addition, the CPO said, there has been high inflation, increasing energy prices, rising labor costs, and bank interests that are putting the ability of certain categories of suppliers at risk. “Airbus developed over the years several collaborative tools designed to better manage the crisis together. First, the Supplier Financial Watchtower,” Westermeier said. “This allows Airbus to monitor the financial health of its supply chain and identify potential issues. We are then able to deep dive into specific situations to understand the risk at stake, and if necessary, co-develop a mitigation plan with the supplier concerned. Not only does this approach ensure we can support our supplier in securing a planned ramp-up, but it also allows us to develop a sense of community.”

All in this together

“We are all on the same team,” Westermeier said. Airbus can also call upon another tool called the Joint Improvement Plan. This is a governance framework designed to mitigate the crisis and, in parallel, transform the ways of working together collaboratively with the supplier to avoid new crises arising in the future.

The CPO said that this methodology is key to building strong relationships with the suppliers and improve mutual trust for future collaboration. Another tool called CONBID enables Airbus to identify the needs of its supply chain for a specific material. “It is key to ensuring we can actively arbitrate the demand within our supply chain and redistribute when required.

“This is something we specially started last year when we realized there would be an issue with the availability of aerospace steel. So, in the present, as we adapt and above all prepare for the future together, collaboration is key. Collaboration is a key lever for increased productivity and enhanced efficiency.”

Boosting resilience

Westermeier said that as Airbus continues to face challenges, it is really critical that the OEM and supplier boost resilience together across the entire aerospace sector. “We have launched a number of collaborative initiatives really designed to increase the effectiveness through standardized approaches such as, and let me start with our initiative, ZERO-M (Zero Missing Parts). Traveled work from the production line to the ramp is the bane of any OEM’s existence. ZERO-M aims to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions across all operational flows and with the final vision of reaching zero missing parts in the long run.

ZERO-M Together is designed to strengthen Airbus’ prevention system, reach higher levels of anticipation and standardize good practices across the industry, such as buffer management.

Another one, called AXcess, addresses how efficiency translates into competitiveness.

Reducing costs

Westermeier said that Airbus developed, tested and standardized a set of proven methodologies that aim at collaboratively taking costs out of the system.

“In light of the difficult economy context, it is quite clear that we all must presume every opportunity to reduce costs whilst ensuring the financial stability of our suppliers, our partners is maintained.

Boeing long ago implemented a supplier cost-cutting program called Partnering for Success. After seeing too many suppliers reporting profit margins larger than Boeing did, the company largely forced its suppliers to cut costs or they’d risk being dropped as a Boeing supplier. The program drew widespread angst, with some renaming the effort Partnering for Poverty or Preparing for Sacrifice.

In Boeing’s backyard in the greater Seattle area, some suppliers groused that they preferred working with Airbus. While Airbus also sought to cut costs, they said, at least the method wasn’t as adversarial.

Interestingly, on the sidelines of the Hamburg Aviation Forum, LNA heard similar complaints about Airbus being heavy handed and some preferred working with Boeing.

Airbus has other programs intended to boost collaboration.

For years, OEMs relied on just-in-time delivery of parts and components. With the supply chain still operating below peak efficiency, Airbus—and others—have added buffers to inventory. At Airbus, this buffer is about a four-month supply of parts.

Eco-Aviation

With a shift in emphasis toward eco-aviation, Airbus likewise is working with suppliers—collaborating, to use the buzz word—to make Airbus “greener.”

“We collaborate with our innovation ecosystem to imagine future concepts that will bring this vision to reality,” Westermeier said. For Airbus’ sustainability and innovation roadmaps, “perhaps our biggest challenge in preparing the future is the journey to become more sustainable.

“Sustainability is an industry-wide challenge, and we will only succeed through collaborative and aligned initiatives. It is a special time for the aviation industry, where we connect today and tomorrow. Today, we are part of creating an ecosystem for SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, to decarbonize the current and the future fleet,” the CPO said.

SAF also addresses the current fleet. Airbus is also working on several research and technology projects that are aimed at making its aircraft more efficient and already preparing for the next generation of conventional aircraft he said.

Airbus Initiatives

“Airbus launched a number of collaborative initiatives, focusing in particular on data transparency and decarbonization. The Airbus Supplier Sustainability Council set up back in 2022, establishes a framework to collaboratively accelerate sustainability initiatives with the supply chain and fostering a new model of engagement with suppliers. These ambitious sustainability targets cannot be reached without a clear innovation roadmap.”

Turkish Airlines Orders Up To 345 Airbus Planes - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMTUvdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy1vcmRlcnMtdXAtdG8tMzQ1LWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8xNS90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy11cC10by0zNDUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish Airlines pulled the trigger on its long-anticipated aircraft order, opting for 220 Airbus planes. The order could reach as many as 345 planes if all purchase rights are ultimately exercised. It includes both widebody A350s for overseas routes, and narrowbody A32neos for shorter-haul journeys.

On two separate occasions earlier this year, Turkish announced orders for 14 A350-900s, planes that compete roughly in the same size category as Boeing’s 787-9. The new order includes an additional 50 A350-900s, with purchase rights for another 20.

In addition, Turkish will take 15 A350-1000s, which are larger than the -900s. It added five (or 10 with purchase rights) A350 freighters. The A321 order, meanwhile, involves 150 firm units, with purchase rights for another 100.

“The addition of these advanced Airbus aircraft to our fleet will not only enhance our operational capabilities but also significantly contribute to our environmental goals,” said Turkish Airlines chairman Ahmet Bolat.

Turkish Airlines’ Fleet

In a November company presentation to investors, Turkish said it currently operates 435 planes, which include Boeing 737s, 777s, and 787s, and Airbus A320/321s, A330s, and A350s. That’s up from about 350 total aircraft before the pandemic, and a mere 98 on the eve of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Some of the newly-ordered Airbus planes will be for growth, others for replacing older aircraft as they’re retired.

Boeing was hoping to land more orders from Turkish. According to Cirium Fleets Analyzer, the airline has 31 737 Maxes and 11 787s still to be delivered. Sun Express, a Turkish-Lufthansa joint venture airline, has another 32 Maxes on order. Turkish has not, to Boeing’s disappointment, ordered any 777Xs thus far. The 777X is the largest plane Boeing currently sells.

This year through November, Turkish noted in a recent release, passenger traffic was up 17% from the year prior. Some of that growth reflects the reopening of markets that were closed during the pandemic, notably in Asia.

But it also highlights the airline’s remarkable expansion during the past two decades, underpinned by Istanbul’s favorable geography, Turkey’s large tourist sector, and the airline’s unit cost advantages versus European rivals. It’s also growing a low-cost carrier that it owns, recently rebranded as AJet. And it operates a fast-growing cargo airline.

Ten years from now, Turkish aims to have a fleet of more than 800 planes, servicing more than 100 million passengers a year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997045397758484}",neutral,0.9997045397758484,0
German Bundeswehr orders 82 Airbus H145Ms - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZ2VybWFuLWJ1bmRlc3dlaHItb3JkZXJzLTgyLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1bXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The German Bundeswehr has signed an order for up to 82 Airbus H145Ms. Airbus/Cara Irina Wagner Photo

The German Bundeswehr has placed an order for up to 82 Airbus Helicopters H145Ms, representing the largest ever order for the military version of the type.

The contract is for 62 firm orders plus 20 options, and also includes seven years of support and services, spare parts, eight simulators, and training for pilots and maintenance personnel.

The aircraft will be used in a light attack helicopter role as part of a bridge solution to replace the German Army’s fleet of Tigers.

The German Army will receive 57 of the new aircraft, with the remainder going to the Luftwaffe’s special forces.

The order was placed following approval of the procurement from the Budget Committee of the German Bundestag on Dec. 13, and will be financed from a €100 billion “special fund” the country has set aside for the modernization of its military.

“We are proud that the Bundeswehr has decided to order up to 82 H145M helicopters,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, in a press release announcing the news. “The German Air Force has gained a significant amount of operational experience with its H145M LUH Special Operations Forces fleet.”

Even referenced the “very ambitious delivery schedule” that calls for first deliveries in 2024, with the last aircraft set to be received in 2028,

The multi-role H145M is designed to meet a broad range of mission capabilities, with the ability to be quickly reconfigured from a light attack role (with axial ballistic and guided weapons and self protection systems), into a special operations version that includes fast rappelling equipment.

Airbus said the new German H145M includes options for future mission capabilities, including the ability to operate with the integration of manned-unmanned teaming and upgraded data links and communication systems.

The basic version of the aircraft will be equipped with fixed provisions, including Airbus’s HForce weapon management system. Airbus said this will allow the Bundeswehr to train its pilots on the same type of aircraft that is used for operation and combat.

The aircraft will be based at the International Helicopter Training Center in Bückeburg, at Army bases in Niederstetten, Fritzlar and Faßberg, and with the Air Force in Laupheim.

The Bundeswehr already operates 16 H145M LUH special operations and eight H145 LUH search-and-rescue helicopters. The U.S. Army employs almost 500 helicopters from the H145 family — the UH-72 Lakota. Other operators of the H145M include Hungary, Serbia, Thailand and Luxembourg. Cyprus has ordered six aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99996018409729}",neutral,0.99996018409729,0
Airbus Needs to Deliver 97 Jets in December to Meet 2023 Goal - SupplyChainBrain,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM4NjIxLWFpcmJ1cy1uZWVkcy10by1kZWxpdmVyLTk3LWpldHMtaW4tZGVjZW1iZXItdG8tbWVldC0yMDIzLWdvYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE needs to deliver 97 planes in December to meet chief executive officer Guillaume Faury’s 2023 goal of 720 handovers.

The planemaker shipped 64 jets in November, it said December 5, bringing the tally to 623 for the first 11 months of 2023. The Toulouse, France-based company also said it booked 113 gross orders last month when it faced off with Boeing Co. for business at the Dubai Airshow.

Output at Airbus typically surges in December, as the European planemaker runs factories at full bore to meet annual targets. The company also completes the final work on aircraft that are largely built and waiting on parts, helping to boost the tally in the final month. In December 2022, the planemaker shipped 98 jets, and it routinely delivered more than 100 at year's end before the COVID-19 pandemic snarled supply chains.

As recently as November, Faury expressed confidence Airbus could meet its year-end goal.

Planemakers are trying to strike a balance between customers buying planes in record numbers and suppliers struggling to keep up with the faster pace of production. Both Airbus and rival Boeing Co. have encountered roadblocks with manufacturing faults at some parts companies, making output more challenging.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990392923355103}",positive,0.9990392923355103,1
Air China Cargo welcomes first Airbus A330 converted freighter - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItY2hpbmEtY2FyZ28td2VsY29tZXMtZmlyc3QtMTUxNjAyMDk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A freshly converted A330-200 cargo jet sits outside the Air China Cargo terminal in Shanghai. (Photo: EFW)

The cargo subsidiary of Air China has received the first of eight used Airbus passenger aircraft that are being retrofitted to transport shipping containers on the main deck.

Elbe Flugzeugwerke, an Airbus joint venture company that specializes in aftermarket engineering projects, announced Friday that licensed contractor Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corp. (Ameco) converted and delivered an Airbus A330-200 to Air China Cargo.

It is the first time that Air Cargo China will operate the A330-200. The national flag carrier currently has three Boeing 747-400 and nine Boeing 777 freighters. Air China Cargo is expected to dispose of four Boeing 757-200s that have not been in service for several months. It operates two domestic routes and 14 international ones, with its main base in Shanghai. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has a 24% ownership stake in the cargo airline.

EFW publicly disclosed for the first time that Air China Cargo early this year signed a contract for the passenger-to-freighter conversion of eight A330-200s. Air China, which revealed its intentions in a securities filing last April, is discontinuing use of the widebody aircraft in its passenger fleet and transferring them to its cargo division. A second aircraft is already undergoing conversion in the production hangar, EFW said. The rest of the planes are expected to be delivered in 2024 and 2025.

Ameco is the largest provider of maintenance and overhaul services for aircraft in China. It signed a partnership agreement in November 2022 to install EFW-designed conversion kits at its facility in Chengdu.

The A330-200 converted freighter has a gross payload of 61 tons at a maximum range of 4,200 nautical miles. It is more suited for heavier, general cargo while the -300 is the preferred choice for lighter e-commerce shipments because of its extra volume.

EFW has set up new conversion sites in China, Turkey and the U.S. to meet rising demand for cargo reconfigurations. Conversion facilities were swamped with orders for the past three years, but airline and lessor interest has slowed to a trickle this year because of the prolonged downturn in air cargo shipping.

Story continues

Sichuan Airlines last summer became the first Chinese airline to operate an A330 converted freighter after it was converted in Shanghai by another airframe modification specialist on EFW’s behalf.

Turkish Airlines makes huge Airbus order in bid for air dominance - FRANCE 24 English,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzEyMTUtdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy1tYWtlcy1odWdlLWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1pbi1iaWQtZm9yLWFpci1kb21pbmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Istanbul (AFP) – Turkish Airlines said on Friday it has decided to purchase more than 200 Airbus aircraft -- with the option for over 100 more -- in the coming decade as it seeks to become the world's largest carrier.

Turkish Airlines chief executive Bilal Eksi said in a social media statement that the entire order could potentially add up to 355 aircraft.

The deal would be one of the industry's largest and substantially expand the Turkish flag carrier's existing fleet of 439 jets.

""I wish good luck to our country and our company,"" Eksi said.

Turkish Airlines said in a separate corporate filing that the purchases would be made as part of its ""strategic plan"" for 2023-2033.

But the airline and Airbus differed slightly about the details of the deal.

The Turkish Airlines statement said it had made firm orders for 230 jets and placed purchasing rights for an additional 125 aircraft.

Airbus said the 230 figure included 10 jets Turkish Airlines had ordered in September and thus covered only 220 new aircraft.

The airline's confirmed order purchase -- which includes 150 A321 NEO and 60 widebody A350-900 jets -- has a catalogue price of more than $40 billion.

Few deals cost their actual sticker price because plane makers make discounts for bulk orders.

Cheers in Britain

The Turkish carrier's existing fleet is split evenly between Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

The new order delivers a massive boost to the European aerospace giant in its race for global supremacy with its US rival.

""This order for the latest generation aircraft is a demonstration of the bold vision by Turkish Airlines,"" Airbus executive Christian Scherer said in a statement.

""We are proud to accompany Turkey's connection to the world with our state-of-the-art aircraft.""

Turkish Airlines is based in Istanbul's newly-built international airport and flies to 120 countries.

The company claims to own ""the title of the airline that flies to most countries in the world"".

Turkish Airlines said the deal also includes a separate order for Rolls-Royce to provide maintenance services and spare parts for the A350 jets' engines.

The British government said Friday's deal includes 70 aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce.

""This landmark deal between Turkish Airlines, Airbus and Rolls-Royce demonstrates that the sky's the limit for the UK's thriving aerospace sector,"" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.

British trade secretary Kemi Badenoch called it a ""bid win for the UK's world-leading space sector"".

This increases our order list of around 200 aircraft to 280 – plus an additional 120 purchasing options for further state-of-the-art short- and medium-haul aircraft. We are pleased that both Airbus and Boeing were able to convince us on all commercial and technological aspects. In addition to this, the decision for the Boeing 737-8 MAX will also give us more flexibility for the procurement of short- and medium-haul aircraft in the future. The new ultra-modern aircraft offer our guests additional comfort. They are also quieter, more economical, more efficient, and emit up to 30 percent less CO2 than their predecessor models. The order demonstrates our airlines' future viability and ability to invest, and it shows that we are living up to our responsibility to reduce our carbon emissions.""



Airbus A220-300



This latest-generation aircraft has 148 seats and consumes around 2.5 liters of fuel per 100 passenger kilometers. The A220 is intended for use by the newly founded airline Lufthansa City Airlines and will be deployed on short-haul routes from Frankfurt and Munich. With its ultra-modern geared turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney, the A220-300 is ideal for use in feeder traffic. The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2026.



Boeing 737-8 MAX



The Boeing 737-8 MAX is the further development and 4th generation of the world's most widespread commercial aircraft. The aircraft will have 190 seats in Business and Economy Class and, thanks to its efficient engines from CFM International, will only consume around 2.2 liters per 100 passenger-kilometers. The first aircraft is expected in the third quarter of 2027. As the planned growth path for both Lufthansa Airlines, including Lufthansa City Airlines, and SWISS is already underpinned by aircraft orders, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will be deployed in one of the Lufthansa Group's other flight operations. The decision on this will be made at a later date.



Airbus A320 family



In addition to the firm orders, Lufthansa Group has secured a further 40 purchase options for aircraft from the A320 family. Around 450 aircraft of this model series are currently in service with Lufthansa Group airlines, making it well-established in the short- and medium-haul segment. 71 A320neo and A321neo aircraft that have already been ordered will be delivered in the next few years. With the agreed 40 purchase options, Lufthansa Group is now securing favorable conditions for future orders as part of the Airbus offer.



New aircraft biggest lever for CO2 reduction



With a current fleet of more than 700 commercial aircraft, the Lufthansa Group is pursuing a long-term fleet strategy focused on cost efficiency and reducing emissions. Compared to their predecessor models, the new additions to the Lufthansa Group fleet have up to 30 percent lower fuel consumption and correspondingly lower carbon emissions. The Lufthansa Group aims to halve its net carbon emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Around USD 9 billion at list price



The aircraft orders agreed today, worth around USD 9 billion at list prices, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's capital expenditure in 2023 and 2024, the period covered by the current medium-term plan. Net investments of between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 3 billion are expected in 2023. Capital expenditure in 2024 is expected to be at a similar level.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5291144251823425}",neutral,0.5291144251823425,0
Airbus’ final three-month delivery push brings annual target within reach - AeroTime,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtb3JkZXJzLXRhcmdldC15ZWFy0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1vcmRlcnMtdGFyZ2V0LXllYXIvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has published its November 2023 delivery data, indicating that the planemaker is on track to reach its total annual target after 64 planes were delivered to 40 different customers last month.

When Airbus published its nine-month update to September 2023, Airbus Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Guillaume Faury, sounded relatively optimistic that the company would reach its target of “around” 720 deliveries by the end of 2023.

With November 2023 results now in, Airbus currently stands on 623 deliveries and therefore needs another 97 aircraft to reach customers in the final month of the year.

“We’ve delivered 71 planes in October. So, what we have to deliver for November and December this year is similar to what we did a year ago. So, it is indeed a big quarter, but we see we have part of that quarter already behind us with our performance in October. We think we are well placed for November and visibility for December. That’s why we feel like we are in a good place to confirm the guidance of around 720 planes in 2023,” Faury told Bloomberg on November 8, 2023.

According to Reuters, on average in the past three years Airbus has delivered 93 planes in December.

Airbus also confirmed that it added 113 gross orders to its books, including a repeat order for 30 more A220 aircraft from airBaltic at the Dubai Airshow 2023.

Another order at the Dubai Airshow came from Emirates as the airline purchased an additional 15 Airbus A350-900 widebodies.

Airbus also received an order for 60 A320neo family aircraft from leasing firm SMBC Aviation Capital on November 21, 2023.

On December 6, 2023, Boeing announced that it had delivered 351 of its popular 737 family of twinjets so far in 2023.

This total is just 25 airframes short of its revised annual target of 375-400 units targeted for the year.

Boeing has yet to confirm its final figures for November 2023 until December 13, 2023, when it will release the month’s total orders and delivery numbers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5343076586723328}",positive,0.5343076586723328,1

(NASDAQ: VSAT) has integrated a secure, flexible broadband Ku- and Ka-band airborne technology onto the Airbus C295 MSA aircraft for the Irish Air Corps (IAC), a division of the Irish Defence Forces focused on the Military Air Defence of Ireland airspace and supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations.

Viasat and Airbus collaborated to integrate Viasat’s flexible dual-band broadband terminal, the GAT-5530, on the C295 MSA aircraft to provide enhanced capability to this multi-purpose military airborne platform. Airbus completed delivery of two C295 MSA aircraft to the Irish Defence Forces earlier this year.

The Airbus C295 MSA, a highly reliable multi-role surveillance aircraft, provides the Irish Air Corps with a new-generation tactical transport and ISR platform that is extremely versatile in the operations it can perform. With more than 280 C295 aircraft ordered worldwide, the platform’s flexibility and tactical support capabilities offer Airbus’ global customer base an enhanced multi-mission aircraft to meet modern mission requirements.

This integration of the Viasat GAT-5530 terminal will enable greater capability through secure, reliable satellite connectivity and enhance support for a range of command, control and communication (C3) mission needs – from tactical transport of troops and supplies to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The GAT-5530 terminal supports the entire ITU Ku- and Ka-bands, which includes 3.5 GHz of commercial and military Ka-band. This multi-faceted terminal offers greater operational flexibility for military customers as they seek increased resilience with multi-frequency (Ku/Mil-Ka/Commercial-Ka), multi-orbit (GEO, MEO, LEO, HEO), multi-network communications architectures.

The Airbus C295 MSA with the fully integrated dual-band terminal was showcased at the Paris Air Show prior to delivery to the Irish Defence Forces. In addition to supporting mission connectivity needs, Viasat’s broadband SATCOM service is designed to provide ample capacity to monitor and analyze in near real time aircraft health data for condition-based maintenance – minimizing operational downtime while extending the life of the airframe.

Viasat has also contracted with the IAC to provide a managed SATCOM service across multiple aircraft. This managed service will provide SATCOM services to the C295 MSA’s, as well as a small fleet of PC-12 special mission aircraft, and will include access to Viasat’s extensive Ku- and Ka-band networks for near-global service coverage.

“Viasat is thrilled to equip the C295 MSA aircraft with our advanced Ku- and Ka-band terminal to meet the specific needs of military customers. By combining our expertise with Airbus, we aim to enhance the operational capability, flexibility, and reliability of aircraft communications systems for military users. Our focus is on delivering secure, resilient, and scalable broadband SATCOM connectivity that is crucial for modern mission success. We’re proud of this collaboration with Airbus and its potential to meet the ever-evolving demands of the military.” — Victor Farah, vice president, Viasat Government Systems
