Sounds like corporal punishment, doesn't it? But based on a patent application filed by Airbus Industries last December, this may indeed happen (via The Los Angeles Times' Hugo Martin).

The seat design featured in the patent is barbarically sparse, without even basic necessities like a backrest, tray tables or any leg room to speak of. In fact, the seats don't even appear to function like seats; instead they are designed to prop up the flyer in an awkward semi-upright position to reduce the space required between rows.

Airbus files patent for saddle seats on planes - CNN,"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXNhZGRsZS1zZWF0LXBhdGVudC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus publishes patent for folding saddle seats with low backrests Vertical seat design packs more passengers into cabins Spokesperson says patent application does not mean design will be developed

CNN —

For air travelers who like to gripe about being cramped in economy, here comes another warning that they’ve never had it so good.

Airbus has filed a patent application showing detailed renderings of what may be the plane seat of the future.

The design shows narrow rows of folding saddle seats with low backrests on which passengers perch rather than recline.

The patent application, which makes even the most budget of budget airline seating look luxurious, was published last month and is available for viewing by the public.

As CNN reported last week, a new study says the vertical passenger seat may be the next big cost-cutting move in aviation.

Upright seat designs would allow airlines to pack more passengers into a cabin and provide an affordable alternative to public transportation on short haul flights.

The patent says current seating configurations have reached their passenger limit but numbers can be increased by switching to saddle-style designs (presumably stowing travelers in the overhead compartments has been ruled out).

It says the saddle format will accommodate four seats into a space previously occupied by three.

The Airbus design is somewhat similar to the SkyRider, a perching saddle for planes developed by Italian firm Aviointeriors and unveiled at an expo in 2010.

If Airbus is looking for positive feedback for its design, it may struggle.

The UK’s Daily Telegraph likened the patent to “the inside of a galley,” under the headline “The world’s most uncomfortable plane seat?”

An Airbus spokesperson told CNN that the patent didn’t necessarily mean it would be saddling up its aircraft anytime soon.

Straight from the Airbus drawing board. from Airbus

“Airbus files hundreds of patents each year – this is what innovative companies do,” Airbus UK head of media relations Robert Gage said via email.

“Many patents never become reality and there is no expectation that this would. It is really to preserve an idea and has not developed beyond this stage.”

Gage said that even if the designs were to be developed, it would be up to airlines would choose the seating configurations and type.

"Airbus A330-800 and -900neo, first analysis, part 3: performance - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy8xNy9haXJidXMtYTMzMC04MDAtYW5kLTkwMG5lby1maXJzdC1hbmFseXNpcy1wYXJ0LTMtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In our first two parts of the analysis of the Airbus A330neo launch at the Farnborough Air Show, we have gone through the information provided by Airbus and Rolls Royce and provided comments on what these really mean from a practical point of view.

Areas we wanted to verify with our independent model have been how the A330neo would perform versus the A330ceo, especially on shorter ranges, than the Airbus example of 4,000nm and how it would stack up against the Boeing 787.

We give the first answer to these questions with data from our proprietary, independent model. This is first-cut data and we bring it forward in time as there is some confusion on what Airbus has said about the shorter range performance of the A330neo.

The performance information provided by Airbus has been dissected and we have done a first independent modeling to verify the validity of Airbus launch presentation claims (given below) but also to clarify the muddled picture of what happens when the range flown gets shorter than the 4000nm example given by Airbus at the FAS. This is important since many sectors flown for a long haul airliner are still 1,000nm to 2000nm intra-Asia and some within Europe. The 4,000nm Airbus is using as reference is a mission which is equivalent to a Trans-Atlantic or a Europe – Asia flight (London to Delhi for example), with typical flight times of 8-9 hours.

Overall performance claim

We have modeled the main changes as presented for the final A330neo, comprising changes for engines, nacelles/pylons and A350-style winglets in addition to the weight changes. We have not had time to dissect and model the aerodynamic improvements Airbus will do to the inner wing. Further we have also not modeled the “Powerplant 11%” in full as the Trent 7000 gives 10% TSFC improvement and we do not understand where Airbus finds the last 1%.

Importantly, we wanted to understand the decline in efficiency improvement when the flown range gets shorter; 4,000nm is about 2,000nm above today’s average stage length for the in service A330 fleet, which is the stage length example used by Airbus since about 2010 to compare the A330-200/300 with the 787-8/9. We don’t think that the A330neo’s average stage length will be 2,000nm, but it will definitely be below 4,000nm. Therefore the performance at shorter flights is important to understand.

With the caution that this is a first run of our model on incomplete data, we can say the following:

We focus this check on the trip improvement of 12%. We will explain why below.

We have initial, more detailed information on what Airbus does to improve cabin utilization but it is too early to say if this shall be counted as a four or six seats increase in a normalized cabin configuration. Airbus has counted the performance numbers with a six seat increase, not the advertised 10 seat increase.

We therefore only look at the trip fuel differences. To further make apples-to- apples comparisons of the aircraft, we configure them with identically loaded cabins of 245 and 295 respectively for ceo and neo variants.

The 12% trip improvement is between a 235t A330-300 and a 242t A330-900neo. To us this means the 330ceo does not have the improvement that the 242t variant will have from changes in flap gondola shapes. In our comparison we compare aircraft with identical shapes.

Our initial analysis says the A330-200 and A330-800neo tracks the difference of the -300/-900 models.

Under these circumstances, we find an improvement of about 10%. We have not modeled the improvement for the inner wing aerodynamics,which involves changes to the slat and the upper wing faring and we have not modeled the 1% powerplant improvement over and above the Trent 7000 10% TSFC improvement, as we are not sure what Airbus means with this 1% gain on top of TSFC.

With both those factors contributing around 1% each (which Airbus says the powerplant improvement does), 12% seems plausible.

Perhaps more interesting at this first analysis is the decline in fuel efficiency gain when shorter ranges are flown. We have a decline of 20%-30% from 4,000nm to 1,000nm. We can thereby conclude that Kiran Rao, Airbus EVP of Strategy and Marketing, meant something else with the quote “for 2-3 hour missions, the A330ceos are still more efficient than a neo,” (from this discussion with Aviation Week).

The A330R for regional

In Thursday’s Farnborough wrap-up press conference, Airbus clarified the role and configuration of the A330R or regional. This model is in the price-list and is subject to ongoing sales campaigns, mainly for intra-China routes. Airbus also clarified that this de-papered and de-rated aircraft is a ceo model. It will not be raised to a neo specification, as this makes no sense. When calculating the total operational costs for the regional, the ceo is the better choice as it has a lower price (the engines are cheaper, as is the airframe), a lower weight and engines which consume 10% more fuel but fuel is a less important factor in the total cost equation for dedicated short-haul. For the discussion above we talk about the average stage length being shorter than 4,000nm, not all flights being shorter.

The A330 versus the 787

It is clear the A330neo forms a competitive proposition versus the 787 and that the competition between the two variants in the 250-300 seat segment will be fierce going forward. We have gained more understanding of the cabin modifications that Airbus has included in the A330neo, and this together with our knowledge from our normalized cabin work for our A330neo study makes it possible to position which models are competing in the market place:

For the 300 seats segment, it is A330-900neo which is competing with 787-9. They are virtually identical in size with the seat gains the neo has. We see that the 787-9 would still hold a very slight advantage in fuel burn of 1-2% for 4,000nm sectors.

For the 250 seat segment, it is the A330-800neo which is competing with a 3%-4% smaller 787-8. The 787-8 is clearly lighter and will show a larger margin to the neo than for the 300 seat segment, and we see that there is still a fuel consumption gap of about 3%-4% between them at 4,000nm.

Why the difference in what we see and what Airbus claims (they claim equal fuel consumption performance)? We don’t know how it configure the 787. We, for instance, use identical -10% TSFC Trent 1000TEN engines on the 787 with identically configured cabins, crew rests etc.

Finally we can point out that Boeing’s insistence of the 787-10 as the -900neo’s competitor is tactics and shall be discarded as such. The 787-10 is about 25-30 seats larger than the A330-900neo. The 787-10, then, shows better per seat efficiency but the model is rather a competitor to a A350-900 regional than a competitor to the 330neo.

As more information becomes available, we will further refine our model and re-analyze the economics of the airplanes. The results will be incorporated into an updated version of our A330neo Business Case Study, which is only a for-purchase item. These additional results will not be posted in this column.

CCAM High-Tech Consortium Lands European Giant Airbus - UVA Today,"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy52aXJnaW5pYS5lZHUvY29udGVudC9jY2FtLWhpZ2gtdGVjaC1jb25zb3J0aXVtLWxhbmRzLWV1cm9wZWFuLWdpYW50LWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aerospace giant Airbus is the latest corporate partner to sign on with the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing, an industry, academic and government consortium dedicated to manufacturing breakthroughs and advancements in applied research.

Also, Aerojet Rocketdyne, a missile propulsion and launch system manufacturer, announced it is expanding its role in CCAM. Both companies will become “organizing industry members,” the front rank of corporate involvement in the center.

CCAM, based in Prince George County, is an applied research center that provides production-ready, advanced manufacturing solutions to member companies across the globe. Corporate members guide the research, leveraging talent and resources within CCAM and at Virginia’s top universities – including the University of Virginia – through a collaborative model that enables them to pool research and development efforts to increase efficiencies. Results can then be applied directly to the factory floor, turning ideas into profit faster and more affordably than ever before.

The Airbus and Aerojet Rocketdyne announcements were made Wednesday at the Farnborough Air Show in London. Patrick D. Hogan, U.Va.’s executive vice president and chief operating officer; James Aylor, dean of U.Va.’s School of Engineering and Applied Science; Barry Johnson, senior associate dean in engineering; Pam Norris, associate dean in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering; and Pace Lochte, assistant vice president for strategic initiatives, were present for the announcement, as was Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

“We value our corporate partners and know that these collaborations are an excellent way to leverage resources,” Hogan said. “New research discoveries will lead to new technologies, attract high-quality companies to the commonwealth and create jobs. As a CCAM member, U.Va. looks forward to working with Airbus and Aerojet, and we appreciate the opportunity to identify new research partners for our faculty and offer new experiences for our students.”

Airbus will join CCAM as an organizing industry member. Having made a five-year commitment to CCAM, Airbus will have influence over management, vision and research plans, appoint one voting member to the CCAM board of directors, and to CCAM’s Industry Operations Board and the Technical Advisory Council. Airbus will also dedicate a full-time person to work at CCAM; provide $500,000 in-kind support, such as equipment and software; and help bring on additional members from among their suppliers.

“Airbus was founded on innovation – we operate daily knowing that using and developing leading-edge technology is a requirement in our business, and CCAM is founded on that mindset,” said Charles Champion, executive vice president of engineering for Airbus. “This union is a natural one. Tapping the intellects of the greatest researchers in the industry benefits everyone involved, from the developers to the end users.”

“Airbus is a global leader in advanced manufacturing and a pioneer in applying forward-thinking innovation,” said Joseph F. Moody, CCAM’s president and executive director. “As a CCAM organizing industry member, Airbus will bring decades of expertise in engineering technologies and manufacturing systems to the research conducted at CCAM.”

Aerojet Rocketdyne is upgrading its membership from tier 2 to an organizing industry member.

“This is an exciting next step in our ongoing partnership with the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing,” Warren Boley, president of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said. “We have had great success in advanced manufacturing techniques and their application to our aerospace and defense product lines. This expanded partnership with CCAM will afford Aerojet Rocketdyne even greater opportunity to innovate and evolve our advanced manufacturing capabilities.”

CCAM industry and government members include Canon Virginia Inc., Chromalloy, Newport News Shipbuilding, Rolls-Royce, Sandvik Coromant, Siemens, Oerlikon Metco, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Blaser Swisslube, Hermle Machine Co., Mitutoyo, Paradigm Precision, Buehler, Cool Clean Technologies, GF AgieCharmilles, Mechdyne, National Instruments, Spatial Integrated Systems, Airbus and NASA Langley Research Center.

A computer rendering of the new A330neo by Fixion-Gwlnsod

Today Airbus revealed two new planes—kind of. In reality, the new Airbus 330-800neo and 330-900neo are updated versions of the same plane design, which originally debuted more than two decades ago. These new souped-up aircraft cut fuel consumption by 14 percent and increase range by 400 nautical miles, according to an Airbus press release. The new models are expected to begin shipping by the end of 2017.

This isn't Airbus's first attempted at smacking a new engine on an old planes. The Economist reports that Airbus found success with the A320neo with orders bordering on 2,700, which was 700 greater than Boeing's closest competitor. Airbus hopes to continue this success with this wide-body model.

""[The A330neo] provides an optimal solution for airlines around the world looking to minimize their fuel and operating costs while offering best-in-class comfort to their passengers,"" says Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier in a press release.

The piece of machinery that's making all this fuel-saving retrofitting possible is the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine. Aviation Week says Rolls-Royce will halve the usual production time of six years to create the 7000; it'll be heavily influenced by the Trent 1000-TEN that's currently in development. The engine itself is 10 percent more efficient than previous models and additional changes to the airframe will have more fuel.

But new models, engines, and cabins are only one bit of new Airbus news. On Saturday, an Airbus patent registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was published and highlights a new way to travel, specifically the way we sit. as Quartz reports, Airbus's proposed patent would ""avoid providing an excessive necessary distance,"" which for the layperson means ""no more legroom.""

So how exactly would that work? Well, passengers would basically sit in contraptions similar to a suspended roller coaster seat, which makes passengers rest in a more vertical position, thus eliminating the need for legroom.

Perhaps this patent's most egregious offense is eliminating tray tables and even cup holders. You can take my legroom, but cup holders are sacred.

As an Airbus spokesperson rightly reminds The Los Angeles Times that these patents rarely (if ever) go into development. However, if unforeseen circumstances forced airlines to make cabins a little more cramped to meet demands, Airbus at least has a plan in place.

This new seating system could have benefits for both airlines and passengers since more passengers would mean cheaper tickets but also increased revenue for each flight. Really, the only loser here is your comfort.

Happy travels.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9950864911079407}",neutral,0.9950864911079407,0
"With A330neo, Airbus gives new life to an older jet - CNET","Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3NjaWVuY2Uvd2l0aC1hMzMwbmVvLWFpcmJ1cy1naXZlcy1uZXctbGlmZS10by1hbi1vbGRlci1qZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A computer rendering of the Airbus A330-900neo Airbus

FARNBOROUGH, England -- Airbus Group launched its A330neo on Monday at the Farnborough International Airshow here, bringing new engines and new aerodynamics to an older passenger jet to cut fuel consumption by 14 percent.

The France-based company announced two medium-haul models, the A330-800neo and A330-900neo, both using Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. Another efficiency improvement comes from wider, more aerodynamic wings equipped with ""sharklet"" winglets at the ends of its wings. They were adapted from Airbus' new A350 XWB -- a high-tech new model that in some cases will be effectively replaced by the refurbished A330neo.

Although the A330neo isn't a total surprise, Airbus only now revealed that its board voted in favor of the idea over the weekend. It's big news for the airshow -- a major aerospace industry event where airlines spend a week scrutinizing the latest planes and placing orders years in advance.

The company hadn't planned the model, but ""enormous"" customer demand caused it to reconsider, Airbus said Monday at a press conference here.

""We expect to sell at least 1,000 of these A330neo,"" said Fabrice Brégier, CEO of the Airbus division of Airbus Group. It will deliver the first A330-900neo in December 2017 and the first A330-800neo in early 2018.

The A330neo will increase the company's development costs from 2015 through 2017, but ultimately will improve Airbus Group profits, said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group, the military and passenger aircraft maker formerly called EADS.

""The A330 is a very important margin contributor,"" Enders said in a statement. ""It's also one of the most reliable and efficient commercial aircraft ever.""

It competes against Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, another twin-aisle jet with a major focus on fuel efficiency. The 242-passenger 787-8 is in widespread use and Boeing just delivered its first 280-passenger 787-9, which it's showing off for the first time at the Farnborough show this week.

Boeing skeptical

Boeing is skeptical about Airbus' claims of 14 percent better fuel efficiency, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing's commercial airplane division, in a press conference here Sunday. He suggested Airbus might be comparing the A330neo to older craft.

""We understand where you can go with wing technology. We think that would be extraordinarily optimistic,"" Tinseth said.

Airbus rebutted Boeing's stance, though, and Brégier said the A330neo's fuel economy is ""equivalent"" to the 787's.

On a 4,600-mile trip, the A330neo uses 12 percent less fuel per plane. And per passenger, the efficiency climbs to 14 percent, in part because it accommodates 10 more passengers in its redesigned form because of reconfigured lavatories and crew galley areas.

The new engine is larger, heavier, and less aerodynamic, but the efficiency more than makes up for those drawbacks. The wingspan is 3.7 meters (12 feet) wider at 64m total (210 feet) and features new ""sharklet"" winglets named after their resemblance to shark dorsal fins. The neo also is 5 percent cheaper to operate, said Chief Operating Officer John Leahy.

""The real bottom line is we can offer it at very very attractive pricing,"" Leahy said.

And Leahy was eager to point out that the A330neo seats are 18 inches wide compared to 16.9 inches on Boeing's 787.

The A330neo effectively replaces the A350-800 in the marketplace, a jet for which Airbus has only a comparatively small 34 orders, Brégier said. But the larger A350-900 has better prospects: Its range is 1,726 miles longer than the A330-900neo, and it can fit nine passengers across instead of just eight, said Chief Operating Officer John Leahy.

The A330neo planes also modernized cockpit controls, Airbus said. For passengers, a modernized interior will support 3D movies, colorful LED-based mood lighting, and ports for connecting electronic devices.

Agile Airbus?

Designing, testing, certifying, and building the jet in three-and-a-half years is a faster development cycle for Airbus. In contrast, the existing A320neo took five years, he added.

""I want an Airbus that is agile and faster in decision-making,"" Brégier said.

In contrast to top-to-bottom redesign of the A350, Airbus is eager for smaller, more frequent updates. ""Yes, we are launching brand-new products like the A350 [but] we are looking for faster incremental improvements. This is one of the best examples we could do,"" Brégier said. ""The business case, I can confirm, is an excellent one.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990625977516174}",positive,0.9990625977516174,1

Expected to enter service in late 2017, the new plane, called the A330neo — for “new engine option” — will be fitted with larger engines built by Rolls-Royce of Britain, which can fly longer distances and burn 10 percent less fuel than the current model.

Airbus said the new engines, a larger wingspan and other improvements to the plane’s aerodynamics, as well as the addition of 10 extra seats, would achieve total fuel cost savings of around 14 percent per flight. The existing version of the A330 seats 250 to 300 in a standard, two-class configuration.

The decision to revamp the A330 follows a similar move by Airbus four years ago to upgrade its short-range, single-aisle workhorse, the A320, which was followed a year later by Boeing’s upgrade of its competing 737. The approach has proved hugely successful for the companies, sustaining demand for both planes beyond the middle of the next decade.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999825954437256}",positive,0.9999825954437256,1

Takeoff on one of Airbus’ new A350WXB test planes is a strangely quiet experience.

Powered by two hulking Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, you’d expect to hear more than just a low whirring noise when tearing down the runway.

But when leaving the ground and heading into the clear blue skies of a Hong Kong morning, there was little else to hear on the newest addition to commercial aviation.

Compounding the hush was the unique nature of the flight.

Most of the select few passengers on board flight AIB 206 to Singapore were from the plane’s manufacturer; part of a dedicated team undertaking the final tests to make sure the aircraft is certified to enter service in December with its first customer, Qatar Airways.

The flight was part of Airbus’s A350XWB “route proving” trip, something akin to a world tour where existing and potential customers can take a look at the goods first hand, while the engineers continue to test and tinker.

Named MSN005, the aircraft that flew across the South China Sea, the Malaysian peninsula and Sumatra, is one of only two of the fleet of five test planes kitted out with a full cabin, so the flight was a good indication of what’s in store for millions of passengers in the coming years.

Seating four abreast in the 42-seat business class sections, nine abreast in the two economy cabins, this is the future of long-haul travel as presented by the European plane maker.

It’s a competitor to Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and new iterations of the 777 and Airbus hope it’ll take up a sizeable chunk of the world’s expanding fleet of twin-aisle aircraft.

At first glance, the gleaming cabin looks simply like a lovely new plane, but dotted throughout are features that Airbus hopes will set it apart from the competition and impress passengers and airlines alike.

“With fiber optics we’ve integrated the cables for the in-flight entertainment system, moved the control boxes to a panel under the seat and flooring and been able to make the floor flat,” says Roland Naudy, the Aircraft Interiors Marketing Manager.

That could be sweet relief for those who found themselves with an in-flight entertainment box stopping them from stretching out their feet.

Seat-back displays in economy are 10.6 inches (26.9 centimeters), which Airbus say will either be powered by Thales or Panasonic, depending on each airline’s preference. Tablets and smart phones can be plugged in and powered from the seat backs, something that’s becoming a new standard.

The LED lighting onboard has a mind-boggling 16.7 million possible color permutations, which not even a 16-hour intercontinental trip could cycle through, while the cabin is pressurized to a height equivalent of 6,000 feet (1,828 meters) instead of a more standard 8,000 feet, which it is claimed reduces the effect of jet lag.

While the plane is touted as being extra wide-bodied (hence the XWB), the height of the cabin without central overhead bins is striking (although that might only be an option for first and business class).

For those that favor a window seat on flights, but find the curve of the sidewall cramps their sleep, the new plane has one of the flattest in the business, so cricked necks might also be a thing of the past.

Another little touch is that the bathroom light that comes on and then dims when the door is opened.

Extreme temperature tests

For the most part the plane looks ready to come into service tomorrow, but throughout there are hundreds of sensors relaying information to a flight test station set up in the middle of the rear economy cabin.

Two test engineers spent the flight poring over the data, gathering up to 120,000 parameters. Everything, from temperature at certain points in the cabin to the fuel flow, could be relayed live back to Airbus HQ in France.

Further route-proving flights to Africa and Australasia are scheduled, and while the flight-worthiness tests have been ongoing for more than a year – including extreme temperature tests in the Arctic, stalls, and aborted takeoffs at full speed – fitting out the interior to clients tastes is a long process too.

“We expect that be around 10 months,” said Didier Nasarre, head of customer program.

In fact, he said, it’s been closer to 20 months for the first customer as everything needed to be done more or less from scratch.

From the height of counters in the galley to the type of carpet, every detail is examined and evaluated by airlines, said Nasarre.

The plane is made of 53% composite materials helping its fuel efficiency.

The A350’s swooped back winglets could make it as recognizable a sight at airports around the world as the crenelated engine covers of the Dreamliner.

“Basically if a plane looks good, it flies well,” said Henry Craig, a pilot for Cathay Pacific, as he peered out the window at the curvy wing-tips.

“I’m a fan of beautiful things and that is a thing of beauty.”

The A350 will come in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000, offering between 276 and 369 seats. As of July there were 742 orders from 38 airlines.

Airbus Cancel Skymark Airlines A380 Order - Business Insider,"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNhbmNlbC1za3ltYXJrLWFpcmxpbmVzLWEzODAtMjAxNC030gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJidXMtY2FuY2VsLXNreW1hcmstYWlybGluZXMtYTM4MC0yMDE0LTc_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group announced this week that it has cancelled an $1.7-billion order for six of its A380 superjumbos slated for Japanese low-cost carrier Skymark Airlines.

According to Bloomberg, the order fell apart due to concerns over the 18-year old airline's ability to actually afford the double-decker jet.

The latest cancellation is a significant setback for Airbus on multiple fronts as the company struggles to gain a footing in the Boeing-dominated Japanese market.

For decades American-built airliners have monopolized Japanese aviation. Due to heavy investment in local firms, companies like Boeing have built great loyalty among Japanese carriers.

However, Airbus has recently made some headway in Japan. All Nippon Airlines placed a $3.3 billion order for 30 A320/321 narrowbody jets this March. JAL placed a landmark $9.5-billion order for 31 A350XWB airliners last October.

When first announced in 2011, the Airbus-Skymark partnership represented a golden opportunity for the manufacturer to forge a strong relationship with a growing Japanese airline. However, the regional carrier — whose previous claim to fame involved a controversy over the length of its flight attendant's skirts — hasn't been profitable enough to support aircraft as large as the A380 on its domestic routes, although it does fly Airbus's 271-seat A330-300 widebody jet.

Western airlines generally use their big planes for long-haul or intercontinental routes. But due to the high passenger volume on certain domestic routes, Japanese airlines have long used jumbo jets like the Boeing 747. In fact, Boeing has even released special 500-seat-plus versions of its 747 jumbo jet that are customized for the Japan's domestic market.

Now that Airbus appears to have lost its only Japanese customer for the A380, and with none of the country's other airlines even willing to consider the aircraft, perhaps it's time to conclude that the superjumbo may be too big, even for Japan.

The Airbus A380, launched in 2007 to great fanfare, has struggled over the past few years to achieve steady sales. Although Airbus as taken more than 300 orders for the jet, nearly half of them have come from one customer, Emirates. Other buyers, such as Virgin Atlantic Airways, have wavered over the financial feasibility of the huge jet.

Making things worse, Airbus has already assembled two of the six Skymark A380s that were to enter service later this year. So far, the company hasn't been able to find another airline to take the jets (the A380 has actually failed to attract a single new buyer in two years).

""It's hard to see how this ends,"" Richard Aboulafia, leading aviation consultant told Bloomberg. ""They've got exactly one enthusiastic customer.""","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9983682036399841}",negative,0.9983682036399841,-1

But for spectators on the ground at the annual Farnborough International Airshow, something was missing: sound.

That’s because the aircraft being demonstrated was Airbus Group’s prototype all-electric E-Fan 2.0. Scheduled to go on sale in late 2017, the eerily silent two-seater is the first step in the company’s alternative-fuel roadmap. Development of the E-Fan and subsequent models, according to Chief Technology Officer Jean Botti, should lead to an 80- or 90-passenger commercial prototype around 2030.

When the E-Fan 2.0 hits the market, it will be used primarily for pilot training. The 500-kilogram plane is powered by a pair of 30-kilowatt electric motors that work together to drive two ducted fans attached to the body behind the cockpit. This electric drivetrain can propel the craft up to 124 miles per hour, with a cruising speed of 99 miles per hour. A third, smaller motor attached to the front landing gear allows the plane to accelerate up to about 37 miles per hour during taxiing and landing. CO 2 emissions are, of course, nil.

As Botti points out, the most important piece of the puzzle is the battery. Here, power density is key. “It’s not like a car, where you can get 1.2 or 1.5 kilowatts per kilo[gram] and make a car run for an okay distance,” he says. “The problem we have in aeronautics is gravity; you have to get up to 7 to 10 kilowatts per kilo[gram].”

Airbus partnered with the Korean company Kokam on the batteries for the current iteration of the E-Fan, though they haven’t yet settled on a battery for the final version. The power supply consists of 120 lithium-ion polymer cells tucked into the wings. Together, the batteries last for 45 to 60 minutes, with a 15-minute reserve; they can be recharged in about an hour. Airbus is also developing a quick-change mechanism so that the cells can be swapped out easily on the tarmac between flights. There is also a backup battery in case of an emergency landing.

Approximately one year after the E-Fan 2.0 debuts, Airbus plans to release a four-seat version, the E-Fan 4.0. In order to extend its possible flight time to three hours, engineers will add an engine that will function much like that of a hybrid car—except that this engine will never be used as a means of propulsion. When the battery depletes below a certain level, the engine will kick in and begin spinning a generator, which in turn will deliver power to the battery packs.

But Airbus, best known for its commercial airliners, doesn’t plan to make a business out of these relatively tiny aircraft. Price tags have not yet been added to the two- and four-seaters. “We’re doing all this to learn and to scale up,” says Botti. “The goal here is to develop the technology to [build] a regional aircraft, an 80- to 90-seater.” Small crafts, like the E-Fan 2.0 and 4.0, will be under the brand name Voltair, a newly-formed subsidiary of the Airbus Group.

Larger planes will be built on a hybrid platform called E-Thrust. Developed in collaboration with EADS Innovation Works (the research and development arm of the European aerospace consortium) and Rolls-Royce, this drivetrain will use its gas turbine engine for extra thrust during take-off in addition to providing power to the batteries while the plane is cruising.

All this work fits into a larger effort initiated by the European Commission in 2011, called Flightpath 2050. Two of the program’s primary goals are to reduce CO 2 emissions from aircraft by 75 percent and cut their noise by 65 percent—all by the year 2050. While Airbus is not sharing specific projections for the efficiency of its hybrids at this time, crafts like the E-Fan 4.0 should easily meet these goals, since they only burn fuel for a fraction of flight time and electric motors are virtually silent when compared to gas engines. But, according to Botti, hybrid flight might not be enough to reduce the footprint of larger 350-passenger commercial airliners. “We think the future will call for biofuels instead of electricity,” he says.

That doesn’t mean that larger planes don’t also have something to gain here. Botti says that what’s learned during the development of these electric and hybrid systems could trickle down to conventional aircraft. Increased battery efficiency, for example, could lead to more-intelligent power usage or new power sources for landing gear.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999561309814453}",neutral,0.9999561309814453,0
Airbus files patent for folding 'saddles' to replace plane seats - WIRED,"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtc2VhdC1wYXRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The cattle class of economy passenger flights could be getting a lot more legroom -- at the expense of a lot less seatroom. A US patent filed by French flight operator and plane manufacturer Airbus imagines the future of air travel as tightly-packed rows of passengers perched upright on ""motorcycle-type saddles"".

The patent describes a ""seating device with reduced bulk for an aircraft"" complete with rotating armrests and a mechanism that allows the ""saddle"" and backrest to fold upwards, out of the way to allow passengers to squeeze into their window seat. The seating position also appears higher, increasing the vertical legroom in order to compensate for the severely reduced horizontal legroom.

The idea is sure to catch the eye of no-frills airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair who will be looking to remove even more of what is conventionally considered to be basic requirements to distinguish human passenger flight from cargo transport. Included in the patent is an explanation of why a company would choose to essentially stand passengers up for short-haul flights of ""one to a few hours"". ""In the aeronautical sector, some so-called 'low cost' airlines seek to increase the number of passengers transported on each flight, and more particularly on short-haul links, in order to maximise the return on the use of the aircraft. ""To that end, and by using the same aircraft or aircraft of similar capacity, the number of seats in the cabin must be increased. In all cases, this increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers. In effect, to increase the number of cabin seats, space allotted to each passenger must be reduced.""

It's nice to see that Airbus is at least not kidding itself.

Airbus A330Neo To Challenge Dreamliner - Business Insider,"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBuZW8tdG8tY2hhbGxlbmdlLWRyZWFtbGluZXItMjAxNC030gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTMzMG5lby10by1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtZHJlYW1saW5lci0yMDE0LTc_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Coinciding with this week's Farnborough Airshow in Britain, Airbus Group announced Monday that it would launch an updated version of its A330 passenger jet called the Airbus A330neo (new engine option). The plane is being hailed by Airbus as more efficient and reliable than earlier versions, reports CNET.

Monday's announcement from Airbus included revamps of two medium-haul models, which are intended to compete with Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner. The 280-passenger Boeing 787-9 variant will also make an appearance at Farnborough this week.

The two new models are essentially old A330 planes with new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines that will increase the plane's range by 400 nautical miles, as well as wings with aerodynamic ""sharklet"" winglets at the tips, adapted from Airbus' A350 XWB. The 210-foot wingspan is 12 feet wider than the wingspan of the original A330. Those upgrades will allow the A330neo to reduce fuel consumption by 14% per seat on a 4,600-mile trip compared with today's A330, making its fuel economy equivalent to the 787, Airbus claims.

Thanks to a redesigned cabin, the A330-900neo will fit up to 310 seats, allowing for 10 more passengers than today's A330, while the smaller-fuselage A330-800neo will seat six additional passengers for a total of 252 seats. Passengers in economy class will find 18-inch wide seats, compared to 16.9-inch-wide seats on the Boeing 787. The modernized interior will allow passengers to enjoy full-LED mood lighting, Wifi connectivity, and 3D films.

The company can offer the A330neo at ""very very attractive pricing,"" because it is cheaper to operate, said Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy. And thanks to lower maintenance costs and a higher passenger count, it will be competitive in price with the 787, Kiran Rao, Airbus executive vice president of strategy and marketing, said in a video on the company's website. The A330neo is expected to replace Airbus' 276-seat A350-800, the smallest of the three A350 XWB variants, which has suffered disappointingly modest sales with only 34 orders so far, reports Bloomberg Businessweek.

The reason for the A350-800's underperformance may be the fact that its shrunken size is not as economical. It would cost the same amount to fly the A350-800 as the larger A350-900, although the latter variant can bring in greater revenue thanks to space for 39 more seats, according to Businessweek. Airbus expects to deliver the A330-900neo by December 2017, followed by the A330-800neo in early 2018. The plane is ""one of the most reliable and efficient commercial aircraft ever,"" said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders in a statement, reported by CNET.

Boeing representatives didn't seem too fazed in comments about the new Airbus launch. Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing's commercial airplane division called Airbus' claim of 14% better fuel efficiency ""extraordinarily optimistic,"" according to CNET. ""It is an older technology airplane that is being improved,"" Boeing co-CEO Jim McNerney told CNBC. ""It will compete with brand new technology airplanes that we’ve got across a wide spectrum of widebodies. We feel highly confident in our new technology line that is already in place as it competes against a refurbished A330.""

You can choose to fly first class, economy, or perched on a bicycle seat.

Airbus filed a patent application for airline “bicycle seats,” which are exactly what the name says they are—bike seats mounted on vertical bars that passengers would sit on for the duration of their flight. The tray table-, headrest-, and legroom-lacking design skimps on comfort but maximizes space efficiency.

| (Airbus Operations)

According to the LA Times, the patent application, submitted in Europe, explains that the intent of the bicycle seat is to reduce the bulk of airplane seating and allow more passengers to board flights.

“‘Low-cost’ airlines seek to increase the number of passengers transported on each flight, and more particularly on short-haul links, in order to maximize the return on the use of the aircraft,” the patent description states. “The number of seats in a cabin must be increased, to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers.”

If Airbus is ever able to utilize its bicycle seats, we hope it will spend any extra profits on special classes to teach pilots to avoid all turbulence.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9922187328338623}",neutral,0.9922187328338623,0

A lot has been speculated about the A330neo, and in the end it did come out a bit stronger than what most had anticipated. Some of that is marketing but a lot is real, and here we give a first assessment of what was launched.

Let’s start with the specifics as given by Airbus and Rolls-Royce today in presentations and discussions. Here are the A330-800neo and -900neo’s main features:

– New Rolls Royce T7000 engines based on the T1000-TEN with CFRP nacelles from SAFRAN using nacelle technology developed for the A380. We understand the nacelles will have laminar flow leading edge shapes, pylons are from Airbus Toulouse.

– New wingtips based on the curved winglets that were developed for A350.

The new winglets are made from CFRP and extend the A330neo span from 60.3m to 64m, more than anticipated. They are still called sharklets.

– An adaptation of the wings twist to reshape the changed pressure distribution the new wingtips generate to the most optimal distribution for the aircraft. Airbus also optimizes the inner slats outer shape to improve the wings cruise aerodynamics.

– A cabin which is derived from the A350. Both business and economy cabin now look like in the A350, featuring modern IFE/connectivity,

mood lighting and electronically regulated air-conditioning. By using Spaceflex, smart lavatories and an optimized cargo bay crew rest, housing both flight crew and cabin crew, the seat count can be increased with six seats. The cockpit adopts technology from A350 giving increase cockpit commonality with the A350 range.

– Lowered maintenance costs. In total the A330neo will require 50% fewer maintenance man-hours over 12 years; this will reduce the direct maintenance costs by 5%.

– A330neo weights and range as given in the table from today’s Airbus presentation:

Noteworthy are the kept Max Take-Off Weights and increased Max Zero Fuel Weights to keep max payload the same as the A330ceo, despite the A330neo weighing almost 5t more empty.

The changed characteristic of the A330

The marked increase of wingspan and empty weight will change the character of the A330. Were it previously most efficient on short-to-mid-haul missions, it will now use its efficiency gains most effectively on longer haul. Today’s Airbus presentation gives a good picture of the long haul gains:

If we leave the per seat gains for the moment and focus the 12% trip fuel gain, this is valid for 4,000nm missions and beyond. For the common 2,000nm missions or below, the increased weight will negate most if not all of the projected fuel consumption improvements. This has also been confirmed by Airbus VP of Strategy and Marketing, Kiran Rao, in press quotes in the days leading up to Farnborough. What this all means in detail will be subject of deeper analysis with our proprietary airplane model. We will present our overall findings here and put the detailed results in an updated version of our 60 page A330neo report.

For now we can see that the A330-900neo will be as good as today’s A330ceo on short haul but not really better. It will, however, be considerably more efficient on the longer haul 8-10 hours Trans-Atlantic and intra-Asia networks. As the typical A330-300 route of today has an average stage length of 2,000nm, we can see that the A330ceo’s attractiveness will not be gone, but will still be a good alternative for short-haul networks with high capacity requirements. Now that the ambiguity hanging over the A330 program is gone, it should not be difficult to sell the 200 open slots that remains until the A330neo is planned to fully replace the A330ceo production end in 2018. How close the A330neo comes to the efficiency of Boeing’s 787 will be the subject of our next assessment.

Summary

The A330neo will be competitive with the in the 250-to-300 seat category, competing with the 787-8/9, complementing the A350-900 and competing with the 777-200ER. Boeing insists on comparing the A330-900 with the 787-10, though the latter carries at least 20 more passengers. We will be taking a look at the Boeing claims that the 787-10 is 30% more economical than the A330-900.

The end result of today’s launch is that Airbus and Boeing enters a new era in widebody competition with very similar yet opposite line-ups. Where one has the derivative spreading its wider wings on the low end (Airbus), the other choose to let the wider wing stretch on the top end (Boeing). They both share the rationale for the derivatives increased wingspan, to carry heavier legacy (aluminum) fuselages.

New Airbus A320 partition is more than meets the eye - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDcvbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXBhcnRpdGlvbi1pcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tbWVldHMtdGhlLWV5ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH: These days, the Farnborough Air Show is perhaps best known as a venue where airframers announce major aircraft program updates, and multi-billion dollar aircraft orders. But beyond the chalets where champagne runs freely after an aircraft order is inked, and past the static display of aircraft preparing to wow attendees with their aerial feats, you’ll find massive exhibition halls filled with the booths of aerospace suppliers both big and small, including those trying to make their mark in the ‘passenger experience’ space. It is here that we reconnected with The STAG Group, which used the show to launch a new plastic cabin partition from its aircraft interiors division, Race Completions.

Initially designed for the Airbus A320, the partition costs one third less than a traditional composite and aluminum partition, and is lighter by the same proportion, according to STAG interiors sales manager Steve Allum. The manufacturing process is easily adaptable to other aircraft, and Race Completions plans to expand the range, producing individual tools for each aircraft type.

Cabin partitions are generally made of glued composite construction with protective aluminum edging. Allum reckons that around 3kg of glue holds a regular partition together, adding to the mix of materials that increases weight and complicates flammability testing. By contrast, Race Completions’ partition is composed of welded plastic. It can be repaired if required, but shrugs off the regular knocks and scrapes that might be expected in service, says Allum.

The STAG executive won’t be pushed on the welding process, but reveals that the only additional material used is a silicone sealer around the edging strip. Literature pockets and unique customer features can be added.

Logic suggests that as the partition is scaled up for larger cabins than the A320, the plastic must be thicker to retain its integrity. Not so, says Allum: “As the component gets larger the plastic core changes in specification. It’s welded and there’s still no glue.” He says the Race Completions’ partition retains its one-third cost and weight saving compared to the traditional alternative.

Cost and weight savings are obvious advantages for the customer, but the light grey colored partition on STAG’s stand hides a clever product feature that can be both passenger pleasing and save airlines more money. Using a unique printing process, which we previously highlighted here, Race Completions can print designs directly onto the component or, more accurately, into the plastic itself.

Ink is impregnated to a depth of 0.25mm, leaving a finish that’s entirely durable – it won’t rub off over time like a lacquer-protected surface design, because a depth of plastic has to be removed before the image is affected.

This durability allows Race Completions’ designers to integrate warning and information placards, for example, into an overall partition design. The printed part then bears placards with no edges to lift over time and therefore no need for replacement.

Remarkably, outside that design process, there is no cost differential across the printing process. “It doesn’t cost anymore to print if an airline orders one design or one hundred.

The aircraft manufacturer will receive a new generation of HP Performance Optimized Datacenters (PODs), boosting its computing capacity to 1.2 petaflops.

HP’s new PODs for Airbus come with pre-integrated clusters of HP ProLiant server blades featuring Intel’s latest processor to enable Airbus to increase HPC capacity while saving energy and space. HP says the new technology will use half as much energy per teraflop as the current system.

The PODs measure 12 meters in length, the equivalent of 1,000 square meters of traditional datacenter space according to HP, and come equipped with 22 50-unit high racks. Each container features the full HP Converged Infrastructure, including blade servers, storage, networking, software, management and integrated power and cooling.

The HP PODs will be delivered to Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany. The upgrade is part of a five-year collaboration with HP, that includes increasing compute capacity, improving datacenter cooling technology and upgrading IT infrastructure.

“We are pleased to build on our supercomputing partnership with HP,” says Guus Dekkers, CIO of Airbus. “Over the next five years, HP will continue to enhance our PODs by boosting capacity and raising energy efficiency while providing increased availability, resilience and security. This will further support Airbus engineering teams in aircraft development.”

Airbus has been relying on the containerized datacenter approach to provide the computational power needed to design and build next-generation aircrafts since 2011. The original deal with HP doubled Airbus’ computing capacity with 2,016 clustered HP ProLiant BL280 G6 blade servers installed in two containers. The 244 teraflops “supercomputer” (the measurement combined the Toulouse and Hamburg installations) was one of the largest industrial systems at the time, placing 29th on the June 2011 TOP500 list.

According to Dekkers, the HP PODs were selected because of their compliance with French and German security and environmental legislation as well as Airbus policies.

HP’s Enterprise Services team has configured the new HPC clusters and is integrating them with the existing Airbus IT infrastructure. One of the perks of the modular design is rapid deployment. HP states that these datacenters can be built, tested and delivered within six weeks.

Headquartered in Toulouse, France, Airbus is a global enterprise of approximately 55,000 employees with offices and subsidiaries around the world.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.993981659412384}",positive,0.993981659412384,1
Farnborough Airshow: Airbus unveils revamped A330 - CNN,"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus is launching the A330neo range, a revamped version of its successful A330 models The company made the announcement at Farnborough International Airshow Airbus' new wide-body planes will compete with Boeing's Dreamliner 787

CNN —

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, the old adage goes.

Yet that’s exactly what Airbus is doing to its successful A330 model in order to up its stakes in the skies.

Airbus will launch the A330neo range, a revamped version of A330 airliner, the company announced Monday at the 2014 Farnborough International Airshow held in England.

The new wide-body planes will compete with Boeing’s Dreamliner 787.

“The A330 has been one of our most successful aircraft in the Airbus wide-body family,” said Kiran Rao, Airbus’ executive vice president of strategy and marketing.

Airbus has sold more than 1,300 A330 airplanes to nearly 100 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful aircraft in the wide-body category, Rao said.

“What we are doing is making this aircraft, which is already great, better,” he said.

The newly launched A330-800neo and the A330-900neo (enhanced versions of the A330-200 and A330–300 models, respectively) will feature several new features, according to Airbus, not the least of which is a vast improvement in fuel efficiency.

With the help of new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, an 800 kilograms reduction in weight of the aircraft, and a new aerodynamic design featuring a 64 meters wingspan and curved wingtips, the new airliner will see a 14% reduction in fuel consumption per seat.

“We enjoy very good sales of the A330, but we were listening to our customers. People were telling us, your aircraft is fantastic, but would be even more fantastic if you could achieve a better level of fuel burn,” Fabrice Brégier, president and CEO of Airbus, told CNN.

But not everyone is convinced by Airbus’ claims of better fuel efficiency. Boeing’s marketing head, Randy Tinseth, said he found Airbus’ estimate “extraordinarily optimistic,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Brégier also admitted that since the investment was not planned, the new model will increase Airbus’ development costs through 2017.

He also said he anticipated the A330neo family would ultimately improve profits, and that he expects to sell at least 1,000 of the aircraft, which will be available for delivery by the end of 2017, during the week-long airshow.

Previous experience suggests that Brégier has a point.

Sales for Airbus’ A320neo, a similarly updated version of their older, single-aisle A320 model, has been off the charts, with over 2,800 orders since it was launched in 2010, the company said.

The new models are appealing to airlines as they tend to be cheaper than completely new designs.

Still, the reduced cost, though attractive, is not the only feature likely to bring in new customers.

The new aircraft also come outfitted with updated controls in the cockpit, and a larger rest area for cabin crew.

Rao says that customers will be please with wider seats (18 inches in economy) and an updated in-flight entertainment system that will allow passengers to watch movies in 3D.

Incident a Barcelona airport caught on video: Airbus 340 runway incursion during Boeing 767 landing - The Aviationist,"Sun, 06 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3RoZWF2aWF0aW9uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDE0LzA3LzA2L2luY2lkZW50LWEtYmFyY2Vsb25hLWFpcnBvcnQtY2F1Z2h0LW9uLXZpZGVvLWFpcmJ1cy0zNDAtcnVud2F5LWluY3Vyc2lvbi1kdXJpbmctYm9laW5nLTc2Ny1sYW5kaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UTair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) from Moscow and Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) were involved into a rather rare but dangerous incident at Barcelona airport.

Here’s an interesting video.

It shows an unauthorized runway incursion at Barcelona airport, in Spain.

According to the user who filmed the incident, Flight UT5187, a UTair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) from Moscow was on final for runway 02 when Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) crossed the runway to taxi to the holding point of runway 25R.

As soon as the Russian pilots saw the Airbus 340 crossing the runway, they performed a successful go around.

After the incident, the Boeing 767 landed safely on runway 02, as the footage shows.

Even if the aircraft did not come too close each other, such an incident could have had a much different outcome in case of bad weather and scarce visibility.

Needless to say, in both military and civil aviation, failure to comply with the “hold short” instruction by the Tower can be extremely dangerous, to say the least.

Airbus Group joins Perlan Project to soar to 90000 feet - AOPA,"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTQvanVseS8yOC9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtam9pbnMtcGVybGFuLXByb2plY3QtdG8tc29hci10by05MDAwMC1mZWV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group joins Perlan Project to soar to 90,000 feet

With the Perlan team and members from Airbus Group gathered around a mock-up of the Perlan glider at Boeing Plaza, Warnock explained the group’s three-fold mission: to soar the edge of space (five miles higher than the record set by the Lockheed U-2), on stratospheric mountain waves; to explore how the polar vortex interacts with stratospheric mountain waves and affects global weather models; and to inspire younger generations to seek careers in adventure, meteorology, space exploration, and other fields.

“A couple of years from now, you’re going to say, ‘Yeah, I saw that at AirVenture,’” said Experimental Aircraft Association Senior Communications Advisor Dick Knapinski.

The Perlan Project announced Airbus Group as a partner in Perlan Mission II, an effort to soar to 90,000 feet and explore the edges of space. The aerodynamic conditions at that altitude are similar to that of Mars, Perlan Project CEO Ed Warnock said July 28.

By becoming a partner in the project, Airbus Group will provide funding to complete the construction of the glider and two years of flight in Argentina.

Airbus Group Chief Technical Officer Jean Botti said that the Perlan Project “resonated very clearly with us” because of the company’s dedication to aviation and innovation. Botti said that the project will point to future challenges in aviation and explore very high flight altitudes, both of which are important to Airbus Group.

While the Perlan Mission II glider is based on large gliders currently being flown, it is optimized for high-altitude flight, with an 85-foot wingspan and a 36:1 glide ratio. Conventional gliders that have a better glide ratio at lower altitudes would have a ratio of about 15:1 at 90,000 feet, project manager Morgan Sandercock said. (See “Glider pilots aim to reach 90,000 feet on wind power.”)

The glider will be assembled by RDD Enterprises in Oregon, and the first flight should take place in July 2015. The glider will then be tested in June 2016 in the Sierra waves at altitudes ranging from 40,000 feet to 45,000 feet before attempting the flight to 90,000 feet in Argentina later that summer. The glider will be designed to maintain a cockpit pressure altitude of 15,000 feet at 90,000 feet. It will carry 100 cubic feet of makeup air, and the pilot’s breath will be recycled. The glider will not be heated, so the group is researching suits that will withstand the frigid temperatures in the stratosphere.

The project builds on work that Einar Enevoldson, founder and chairman of the board for Perlan Project, and the late Steve Fossett did in August 2006 by soaring to more than 50,000 feet in El Calafate, Argentina.

“Now is the time we can actually do it,” Enevoldson, said of the sailplane, technology to research the atmosphere, and funding to make it possible. “And we’re going to do it.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999366998672485}",neutral,0.9999366998672485,0
My First Flight on the Airbus A350 XWB - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy9maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtb24tdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A flight test program is a finely-tuned schedule, down to the most detailed demonstration, with every minute of flight time accounted for. The deadlines of certification and delivery loom ever-closer as the engineers and pilots continue to put the aircraft through its paces. Still, recently, Airbus was able to somehow wedge a 60-minute flight into their A350 XWB timeline to showcase their newest family member to a media contingent visiting Toulouse for their ‘Airbus Innovations 2014’. I was fortunate to be one of those that flew aboard that flight.

The fact that Airbus was prepared to conduct the flight reflects two rather key points. Firstly, that their flight test program is on track and secondly, that they are confident enough in their product to take a load of media scribes aloft. Furthermore, Airbus created specific social media channels for the journalists to share the flight with the world. Consequently, there was a buzz of texting and tweeting as 200 passengers cleared a security channel and filed down the aero-bridge.

The aircraft’s cabin was still in flight test mode, so interspersed amongst the passenger seats were stations of data-gathering equipment, computer screens, and cables taped to the floor. Even so, as one walked through business class and into the economy cabin, there was still that new airplane smell. The interior boasted all of the mod-cons of inflight entertainment systems and even the fasten belt sign was a scrolling digital display. As we all settled in, there was no mistaking that this was a new generation of passenger jet and we were very privileged to take flight.

Pushing back from the terminal, I looked towards the wing-tip through generously sized windows. The winglet design is in itself interesting, as it presents as a crossover between a blended winglet and a raked wing-tip. Its sweeping look is eye-catching, but more importantly is there to offset the swirling vortices and aerodynamic drag.

Seated to the rear of the cabin, the noise levels generated as the engines started was negligible and was a trend that would continue throughout the flight. And while the Toulouse taxiways are undoubtedly smooth, the ride offered in the cabin was decidedly gentle, both in terms of any bumps and braking. Combined with the comfortable economy seat, it was obvious that the passenger’s well-being was premium in the design of the aircraft.

With only 30,000 kilograms of fuel on board, the lightly burdened A350 accelerated and soared into the air with a minimum of effort and sweet acceleration. Once again, I was struck by the low noise level in the cabin as the two Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines spooled up and pushed the A350 skyward.

It took less than 15 minutes to climb to 31,000 feet and the pitch over into the level flight was smooth. When the thrust came back to cruise power, the cabin was comparable with the A380 as the quietest that I have encountered to date. That being said, I have yet to fly aboard the A350’s competitor from Seattle.

As we toured the sky over Southern France, contrails criss-crossed the busy blue skies. Air traffic was everywhere to be seen, but none more spectacular than a Rafale fighter that approached to fly in loose formation with the A350. Below, the snow-capped Pyrenees highlighted the border between France and Spain as journalists moved from window to window with their cameras in-hand.

After nearly an hour, and all too soon, the turn back towards Toulouse was forthcoming and the engines throttled back for descent. At one stage the Captain raised the speed-brake, not fully, but a little beyond half way. The panels left their flush positions on the wing’s upper surface but there was surprisingly little aerodynamic noise or buffeting generated by the flight spoilers.

The scene beyond the sweeping winglet soon changed from peaks to paddocks and then to the urban outskirts. Each stage of flap was deployed and the landing gear selected down until the aircraft was fully configured to land. The sound of the final ‘spool up’ of thrust was minimal and the touchdown as gentle as they come.

The test pilots had flown the aircraft impressively, but the aircraft was impressive in its own right. There is a good deal on offer to the passengers in both facilities and comfort, particularly in terms of the quiet cabin.

After I disembarked, I was able to chat with the pilots about the A350 as we looked upon its clean white nose and ‘carbon fiber’ livery parked at the gate – but not for long. Soon the A350 was carrying a new crew and pushing back once more to continue the serious business of flight testing. I was left at sea level this time to contemplate the looming certification and entry into service of the A350 XWB.

Airbus and Boeing Finalize Their Future Widebody Plans and One Looks Better Than the Other – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMTQvMDcvMjQvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctZmluYWxpemUtdGhlaXItZnV0dXJlLXdpZGVib2R5LXBsYW5zLWFuZC1vbmUtbG9va3MtYmV0dGVyLXRoYW4tdGhlLW90aGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the recent launch of the A330neo, it seems that both Airbus and Boeing have almost fully formed their planned portfolios for the long haul, widebody market. Both companies have created three aircraft families that are expected to serve every airline’s needs. But from a capacity perspective, it looks like Boeing has the more comprehensive option. Airbus might still need some work.

We’ve seen a lot of this come together over the last year. Most recently, Airbus launched the A330neo, but the enhanced Boeing 777X line only firmed up late last year. And the 787-10 didn’t become official until last June. Let’s take a look at how these are supposed to compete with each other.

787 vs A330neo

At the smallest end of the widebody market, we have both the 787 and the A330neo. Originally, Airbus was going to try to use the A350-800 to compete with the smaller 787, but it became very clear that Airbus wasn’t getting a lot of orders and had no interest in making that airplane. So at the Farnborough Airshow, Airbus announced it would spiff up its A330 and offer that to customers. The A330neo will basically take the A330-200 and -300, add -600 to each, and then put on a few more seats. Throw on some new engines, make a few changes to the airplane, and you have a winner. The end result is an airplane that competes with the 787-8 on the small end and falls between the 787-9 and -10 on the upper end.

To me, this move makes sense for Airbus, because now it can go ahead and kill the A350-800 (though that hasn’t officially happened yet). It’s still not perfectly competitive, however. The 787 is a brand new, slightly more efficient airplane. So the tradeoff has to be that an A330neo will cost less than the 787 to make it more attractive. (There are probably also earlier delivery slots available on the A330neo since the 787 has such a big backlog.) Airlines that already operate A330s will be interested. Also, low cost carriers that need an efficient airplane but want lower capital outlay at the beginning will also probably like this plan.

But there’s one other issue for Airbus. The A330-900neo is just about the same capacity as the A350-900. Why have that kind of overlap? The tradeoff here is between price and range. The A330-900neo costs less than the A350-900 but its range is also a short 6,200nm (nautical miles) versus the A350’s 7,750nm. If range matters, you’ll buy the A350. If price matters, you’ll buy the A330. And of course, it also depends on what other needs you have, whether going bigger or smaller, to see which family fits best.

787 vs A350

When the A350 launched, the -900 was bigger than Boeing’s biggest planned 787 (the -9). And then Airbus had the A350-1000 which was going to push into the 350+ seat range. Boeing had a gap, but it wanted to protect sales of the 777, so it wouldn’t grow the 787. Boeing has finally given into pressure and last year committed to the 787-10. At 323 seats, it’s still smaller than the A350, but that’s because Boeing has a bigger airplane that can compete with the A350 on the upper end. We’ll get to that in a minute.

This does hurt Boeing’s chances of selling the smaller 777-200s that exist today, but let’s face it. Those are pretty much dead anyway. Both Airbus and Boeing have good families here, but Airbus serves a slightly larger market.

777X vs A350

Here’s where the biggest issue lies in the Airbus portfolio. Boeing has decided to go forward with the new 777X, and that will be its big widebody twinjet. The -8 will seat 350, about the same size as the A350-1000. But the -9 will seat 400. This gives Boeing a bigger airplane to which Airbus has no answer. Of course, the 777X will be a derivative of the original 777 design so it’s not likely to be the most efficient option at 350 seats.

The A350-1000 should be a rock star in that regard, but if you want something moderately bigger, Airbus has nothing to offer. Just look at Emirates. The airline canceled its order for 50 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s last month. Then it turned around and ordered 35 777-8Xs and 115 777-9Xs. Emirates, like a lot of airlines, wants to have a mix that skews toward bigger jets. Airbus didn’t have anything to offer in that area. (I’m talking moderately bigger. We’ll get to the behemoths later.)

There’s been plenty of talk about Airbus moving into an A350-1100, and that would compete. But none of that is official at this point. It also remains to be seen if the A350 can be stretched that far and still be an efficient airplane. It wasn’t designed to be that big so there could be some real structural changes required to make it work. I don’t know, but I’m sure the engineers over there do.

747 vs A380

Up at the top end of the market, we still have the A380 and 747-8 lumbering along. Frankly, I don’t see a big future for either of these airplanes. Airbus continues to make noise about lowering raising the floor to allow for more seats. And this whole idea of an A380neo seems crazy to me, though Emirates obviously likes that idea. Other than Emirates, however, there’s just not a ton of demand at the high end. The same goes for Boeing and its 747-8, which hasn’t sold many of those in passenger configuration.

At this point, both airplanes are in production so they should try to sell the heck out of them. But they should realize that there’s a limited shelf life for both. Further development efforts should go into smaller airplanes.

—

In the end, we have two manufacturers with good options. The only thing that really seems to be lacking is an Airbus twin that can compete with the new 777-9X. If Airbus develops the A350-1100, that solves that problem. Then both manufacturers will have pretty much every tool they need to appeal to nearly every airline. And airlines will be happy to make them beat each other over the head as part of the negotiating process.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998688697814941}",neutral,0.9998688697814941,0

Airbus plane seat patent application: These horrifying seats are a good idea for tall passengers. - Slate,"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3NsYXRlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0LzA3L2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZS1zZWF0LXBhdGVudC1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi10aGVzZS1ob3JyaWZ5aW5nLXNlYXRzLWFyZS1hLWdvb2QtaWRlYS1mb3ItdGFsbC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At first glance, it would seem that Airbus is busy conjuring new ways to torment coach-class airline passengers. The aircraft manufacturer recently filed a patent application that would further reduce the amount of space between seats on an airplane, allowing airlines to cram more passengers than ever into economy class. The new “seating device,” which looks like a cross between a bicycle seat and an office chair, is mercifully designed for use in short-haul flights; as the Los Angeles Times pointed out, “it has no tray table, no headrest, and very little legroom.” Brian Fung of the Washington Post jokingly described it as a “medieval torture device.” Many commenters expressed similar revulsion, swapping horror stories from various flights gone wrong.

But not everything about the Airbus proposal is bad. In its patent application, Airbus helpfully acknowledges that “it is no longer possible to further reduce the seating width, particularly in economy class.” In other words, your terrible seatmate digging his elbow into your ribcage will not be enabled to dig any harder by his new bicycle seat. But passenger width isn’t the only conundrum that airlines face today. Airbus also addresses the pesky issue of legroom, stating, “it is difficult to further reduce [the] distance between the seats because of the increase in the average size of the passengers.” Tall people, that means you.

Current seating configurations are particularly painful for long-legged individuals, who shockingly don’t quite fit into a space designed to provide the bare minimum wriggle room possible for a person of average leg length. Even if you do fit, chances are the passenger in front of you will fully recline into the already-bruised flesh of your knees, igniting a murderous rage. At 6’4’’, I speak from experience: Shorter people have it easy when it comes to some forms of mass transit. What exactly are taller individuals (in this case meaning anyone above the average U.S. male height of 5’9’’) supposed to do with their knees? Put them in overhead bins? For many of us, the only answer is shelling out extra cash for exit-row or economy-plus seats, which are harder to come by.

Even in an exit-row seat, the foam-and-metal slabs we are accustomed to today are horrible: a 31-inch seat-pitch (a normal allotment for a seated person, butt-to-knee) is an insult to the vertically gifted passenger. In contrast, Airbus’ new seating “makes it possible to raise the seating further by comparison with the aircraft seats with a parallelepipedal seating.” Parallelepipedal refers to the three-dimensional parallelogram of despair in which today’s economy class passengers are confined. (It’s also satisfying to say aloud.) In turn, the patent explains how the height-adjustable seat “enables each passenger to adapt the seating height to his or her morphology, and this avoids providing an excessive necessary distance for passengers of large size by avoiding having them seated too low.” Much as bicycle seats and office chairs may be adjusted for height, seating that allows for height adjustment might spare tall passengers the indignity of clown-car situations.

And parallelepipedal seating isn’t exactly good for anyone’s posture, anyway. A flat rectangle of foam may look comfier than a saddle seat, but it does a number on your lower back. While the new seating looks Spartan, it simply provides support where it is most needed: the lumbar region. Similarly, the “motorcycle-saddle” style seat better supports the buttocks, even swiveling to provide rotational mobility in the lower back.

In order to reassure anxious travelers desperately clinging to what little space they have, a company spokeswoman emphasized the conceptual nature of the patent. A patent merely establishes the idea as Airbus’ intellectual property: something to build upon, tinker with, and improve before eventual implementation. (Seatbelts, for example, are probably a necessary step.) The new seats aren’t perfect, but they’re on the right path.

The Asian airline cited financial trouble as the reason for backing out.

Airbus said Tuesday it had written off a deal with Japan's Skymark Airlines for the purchase of six A380 passenger jets. The deal was reportedly cancelled due to the Asian low-budget carrier's poor finances.

""Following discussions with Skymark Airlines, and in light of the airline's expressed intentions in respect of the A380, Airbus has in accordance with its contractual rights notified Skymark Airlines that the purchase order … has been terminated,"" Airbus said in a statement.

The announcement came a day after French media reports called into doubt the Japanese carrier's ability to live up to its financial commitments in the $2.5 billion (1.9 billion euro) deal.

Costly cancellation?

Skymark had signaled the deal was at risk when the value of the yen began to slide in late 2012, elevating the cost of new Airbus jets for its fleet.

Skymark recently posted its first net loss in five years as stiff competition in the domestic market hurt its books.

The Japanese carrier indicated it was concerned about overpriced cancellation fees that Airbus might now levy on the company. It said it had little hope of getting back the 190 million euros it had already paid Airbus for the deal that was struck back in 2011.

Skymark's Tokyo-listed shares plunged some 13 percent after it was revealed that the contract with Airbus was in jeopardy.

Adds new members to its market-leading Widebody Family

Launched by Airbus in July 2014, the A330-900 is an important member of the company’s modern, market-leading product line of widebody aircraft

Following a decision by the Board of Directors of the Group, Airbus has launched the A330-800neo and A330-900neo, two new members of its Widebody Family, which will incorporate latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, aerodynamic enhancements and new cabin features. Benefitting from the unbeatable economics, versatility and high reliability of the A330, the A330neo reduces fuel consumption by 14% per seat, making it the most cost efficient, medium range Widebody aircraft on the market. In addition to greater fuel savings, A330neo operators will benefit from a range increase of up to 400 nautical miles and all the operational commonality advantages of the Airbus Family. Deliveries of the A330neo will start in Q4 2017.“The A330 is a very important margin contributor for our Group. It’s also one of the most reliable and efficient commercial aircraft ever. Customers love it. With our decision to re-engine the plane, we will keep the A330 flying high for many more years to come. The development costs for the A330neo will be incurred from 2015 to 2017 with an impact of around -70 basis points on Airbus Group’s 2015 Return on Sales target. However, we have a very good business case and the A330neo, once in service, will continue to significantly contribute to our group’s earnings,” said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group.“The A330neo is the logical evolution of our reliable and versatile A330 Family. It provides an optimal solution for airlines around the world looking to minimise their fuel and operating costs while offering best-in-class comfort to their passengers,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “We see strong market potential for the A330neo, and like its market-leading smaller sister, the A320neo, we are confident this new aircraft will be a success in the medium-haul segment. We are again leveraging a proven aircraft with a wide operator base and making it even more efficient with the latest innovations and technology developments.”In addition to the new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the A330neo will feature incremental innovations, including aerodynamic enhancements such as new A350 XWB inspired winglets, an increased wing span and new engine pylons. Pilots will benefit from latest generation cockpit systems, and the already very comfortable A330 cabin will be further optimised to offer up to ten additional 18 inch wide seats. Passengers are winners too, as they will be able to enjoy a 21st century on-board experience with for example, fourth generation In Flight Entertainment (3D films), mood-lighting and full connectivity.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Want major new aircraft designs? Wait until 2030 - CNET,"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3NjaWVuY2Uvd2FudC1tYWpvci1uZXctYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVzaWducy13YWl0LXVudGlsLTIwMzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus' A330neo is a new take on an old design. Airbus

FARNBOROUGH, UK -- Over the last century, the aviation industry has steadily pushed ahead with bold new designs. But with a shift toward more incremental improvements, the airplanes of tomorrow will look a lot like the airplanes of today.

At the Farnborough International Airshow here last week, top aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus announced new passenger jets. But the difficulties of designing all-new aircraft, combined with strong airline demand, mean the two companies have begun relying more on updates to existing products rather than ground-up redesigns.

The airlines aren't standing still, but are refitting older craft with new fuel-efficient engines, updated wings, and other improvements.

""You do not need to do a new program to develop these new technologies,"" Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in an interview. ""You're able to take the things you create and bring them to other aircraft, to develop a really good airplane that meets the market needs.""

The biggest example that emerged at the show was the launch of Airbus' A330neo, named for the ""new engine option"" that the France-based company is bringing to the older twin-aisle jet.

""We are are looking for faster incremental improvements. This is one of the best examples we could do,"" said Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier.

Also in the limelight were Airbus' smaller A320neo, Boeing's 737 Max, and Boeing's bigger 777X.

Boeing and Airbus announced hundreds of new orders at the show, which is a major event on the aerospace calendar for both civilian and military aircraft.

The trend toward incremental change means that passengers hoping for a significantly better flying experience and aviation buffs excited by the latest technology should probably rein in their hopes.

But shareholders can take heart: incremental improvements are a lower-risk course of action than developing all-new designs like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which was supposed to arrive in 2008 but actually took until 2011.

Even with less reliance on dramatic new designs, Airbus and Boeing have huge numbers of orders to fulfill as Asian airlines boom and all airlines struggle with high fuel prices.

""There's a seven-year backlog without even taking new orders,"" said Ben Moores, a senior analyst with IHS Jane's. ""You're going to see a doubling of wide-body production over the next several years.""

That's why the industry is focusing on faster production and updates to existing designs rather than new jets that are costly to design, test, and bring to market.

""Getting a platform certified is an extremely expensive business,"" Moores said. ""There's not much point in designing a whole new platform when you just want to change a few bibs and bobs.""

Updates big and small

Incremental improvements need not be insignificant. For example, the 777X, due in 2020, will acquire innovations that came with the 787 Dreamliner. That includes new composite wings instead of traditional aluminum designs; a tail assembly that uses new, more aerodynamic materials; bigger windows; and a more comfortable, higher interior air pressure.

Much of the 777X will be the same as the current 777, though, and many of the changes coming in future years are less significant.

""The A330 is just an engine change,"" Conner said. ""The 787 Max is an engine change. The A320 is a new engine.""

On top of that, Airbus' attempt to bring a significant new design to market, the A350 XWB (extra-wide body) suffered a blow with one of the three planned models, the 800. At Farnborough, Brégier acknowledged that the A350-800 was effectively a flop even as he boasted that the company expects to sell more than 1,000 A330neo jets. That's on top of more than 3,000 A320neo orders.

Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier Stephen Shankland/CNET

Incremental updates don't guarantee success, said Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly. Boeing's 747-8, an update to its iconic but decades-old 747 design, ""has been such a slow seller that perhaps Boeing shouldn't even have bothered,"" he said.

But flops are less painful with upgrades than with all-new designs such as Airbus' even bigger rival to the 747, the 550-passenger double-decker A380. The A380 hasn't done as badly in the marketplace as the 747, ""but this is less of a problem for Boeing than the A380 is for Airbus because...the 747-8 was a far lower-risk proposition.""

High fuel costs mean new engines

A major incentive for updates is better fuel efficiency -- in particular fuel efficiency per passenger. Fuel efficiency is a huge constraint, with oil prices high and not expected to drop, Moores said.

The A330neo is 14 percent more fuel-efficient than the A330ceo (current engine option), mostly because of its new engines but also because it squeezes 10 more seats by reconfiguring lavatories and crew galley areas. The 737 Max 8 gets a 20 percent fuel-efficiency boost through new engines and 11 more seats.

Since Boeing introduced the current 737NG (next generation) in 1997, the company has improved its fuel efficiency by 6 percent. The 737 Max will improve it another 20 percent over that, and each percentage point is worth about $600,000 in savings over the life of the plane, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing's commercial airplane division.

Airbus has its own arguments prepared, though. The new engines, passenger accommodation, and wing aerodynamics on the A330neo mean that ""we achieve the equivalent [fuel consumption] of the 787-8,"" Brégier said. And the A330neo benefits from the A330's proven reliability, pilot certifications, and other incumbent advantages.

Next big steps

Innovation is certainly not dead -- it will just be a long time before the next big bang arrives beyond the 787 Dreamliner and A350 XWB.

The cycle time for big redesigns ""used to be every 10 years. It takes that kind of time to develop new engines and new airframe technology,"" Conner said. But now it looks like it will be closer to 20 years, Moores said, when aircraft manufacturers choose to save significant weight by replacing today's hydraulic controls with electrical controls for plane wings and other control surfaces.

""They'll start looking at all-electric aircraft in the 2020s for production in the first half of the 2030s,"" Moores said.

Airbus thinks electric and hybrid-electric aircraft have a future, but absent major improvements in battery technology, that won't extend to larger aircraft that carry the vast majority of passengers.

The long wait for major conventional jet improvements could give Boeing an advantage because the 787 is a more radical redesign than the A350 XWB. The 787 uses lots of composite materials like carbon fiber for its wings and fuselage, but the A350 sticks with traditional aluminum. ""It's a lot lower risk,"" Moores said, and it'll still sell well, but Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said at the show the 787's new technology gives Boeing a ""capability and performance advantage for the next or 20 or 30 years.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9969354867935181}",positive,0.9969354867935181,1
Airbus files patent for folding airplane seats - Dezeen,"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy8xNi9haXJidXMtZmlsZXMtcGF0ZW50LWZvbGRpbmctYWlycGxhbmUtc2VhdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News: plane manufacturer Airbus has applied for a patent on folding chairs for commercial aircraft with saddles instead of seat cushions.

The European Patent Office has published details of a US filing by aeronautics giant Airbus for a ""seating device with reduced bulk"".

The design features a backrest and a saddle that pivots out and down in a circular movement to unfold into a seat. The backrest moves down when the seat is folded out, and the saddle tilts forward to reduce the amount of leg space taken up by the passenger.

""In order to reduce the bulk of the seating device in the retracted configuration and to reduce the distance needed to accommodate the legs of passengers between two rows of seating devices, the seating takes the form of the motorcycle-type saddle,"" said Airbus in the patent document.

""Still with a view for reducing the bulk of the device in the retracted configuration, the backrest takes the form of a simple lumbar support held at the end of an arm.""

A raisable armrest is also included and is attached to the backrest support.

Airbus said the design was a response to recent demands from low-cost airlines to cram more seating into existing plane interiors – often to the detriment of passenger comfort.

It builds on three previous solutions that proposed producing narrower seats, reducing the legroom between them and paring down their overall bulk, all of which Airbus says have been pursued to their natural conclusion but now presented problems of accessibility.

""The present invention aims to mitigate the drawback of the prior art,"" said Airbus. ""The backrest makes it possible to widen the access to the seating places situated behind when the seating device is in the retracted configuration.""

""It also becomes possible to further reduce the distance between different rows of seating devices in an aircraft cabin.""

Stripped of their cushions, the seats are mounted on a horizontal pole, with the drawings appearing to suggest a table football-style arrangement.

""In effect, to increase the number of cabin seats, the space allotted to each passenger must be reduced,"" said Airbus in the patent filing. ""However, this reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours.""

The design has already been dubbed the world's ""most uncomfortable plane seat"" by British newspaper The Telegraph.

However, a spokesman from Airbus told the newspaper it was ""unlikely"" the seats would ever be used on passenger planes.

""We file hundreds of patents each year and it's all about protecting ideas,"" he said. ""We are actually pushing airlines for an 18-inch seat width to come as standard on long haul flights – some aircraft have only 16.7 inches.""

Earlier this week Priestmangoode presented a solution to prevent fights for luggage space in overhead compartments on crowded flights, while last month James Lee designed an armrest to end elbow grapples on the plane.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995741248130798}",neutral,0.9995741248130798,0

Airbus is hoping that the new model will be 14% lower fuel burn per seat than the current A330 and they will be able to fly an additional 400 nautical miles.

’œThe A330 is a very important margin contributor for our Group. It’s also one of the most reliable and efficient commercial aircraft ever,” said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group. “Customers love it. With our decision to re-engine the plane, we will keep the A330 flying high for many more years to come.’

There will be two models offered; the A330-800neo and the larger A330-900neo. The two models will be able to hold more passengers than the A330-200 and A330-300 models that they replace. The new -800neo will hold six additional passengers (252) and the -900 will hold 10 (310). With these configurations, it will have the new A330s competing almost head to head with the Boeing 787-8 and the 787-9.

Airbus also plans to bring some of the styling cues from the A350 into the cabin of the A330 with newer IFE systems, LED lighting and full connectivity.

’œThe A330neo is the logical evolution of our reliable and versatile A330 Family,” said Fabrice Brgier, Airbus President and CEO. “We see strong market potential for the A330neo, and like its market-leading smaller sister, the A320neo, we are confident this new aircraft will be a success in the medium-haul segment. We are again leveraging a proven aircraft with a wide operator base and making it even more efficient with the latest innovations and technology developments.’

The new aircraft will boast new winglets and an updated engine; the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000.

The Air Lease Corporation became the launch customer with announcing a Memorandom of Understanding for 25 of the A330-900neo aircraft. Airbus is hoping to start deliveries of the A330neo during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Although Airbus is excited about their new offering, Boeing is not so sure. According to the Wall Street Journal, the 14% efficiency gain is, “extraordinarily optimistic.” Randy Tinseth, vice president, marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes also stated that the A330neo launch is a sign that their A350 family of jets had “failed.”

Updating the A320 with a neo model worked extremely well for Airbus, now let’s see if they can garner the same success with the A330neo.

Zodiac and Airbus Celebrate 40-Year Partnership

On Jul 21, 2014

Among its other products, Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems in Wall manufactures emergency evacuation slides for aircraft – devices that must inflate in less than six seconds to permit passengers’ rapid and safe egress. At a recent event held at its facility, Zodiac celebrated its 40-year collaboration with Airbus Americas.

Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems (formerly known as Air Cruisers Company) first supplied product for Airbus’ A300 aircraft in 1974, and, today, Zodiac’s products are found on all of Airbus’ single-aisle aircraft, and even its newest plane, the A350 XWB.

Zodiac – through its 292 employees – annually delivers 420 emergency evacuation slides, 115 life rafts and over 1,500 major emergency evacuation slide components to Airbus in support of its Single Aisle Program (A319/A320/A321 aircraft).

At the event, John O’Donnell, president of Zodiac, said, “[Zodiac] is dedicated to the success of Airbus. The success we are celebrating today – and our continued partnership – is a result of the commitment of our employees to deliver our customers with outstanding product and outstanding service.”

Airbus’ Daniel Wenninger, Sr., director-A350 XWB US, told the audience, “Thank you for keeping our airplanes and our passengers safe. When Airbus looks for suppliers and business partners, we look for the best: The best quality, price, service and ongoing support, etc. More often than not, these products come from the United States. Some of the best minds, best engineers and production facilities are located here.”

He added, “Zodiac and Airbus have been – and will be – strong partners.”

Zodiac’s civil aviation products also include life rafts, life vests and helicopter emergency floatation equipment. Scott A. Ernst, vice president of human resources at Zodiac said, “There is no doubt that the engineering talent that we have been able to recruit in the state of New Jersey has been unsurpassed by any other state where we have operated.”

Operating from the facilities of Helicopters Italia near the city of Trento, the helicopter conducted 14 customer and operator flights last week, confirming the significant power reserves that provide increased safety margins during flight and while maneuvering. The EC135 T3/P3 benefits from an improved flight envelope, especially in hot-and-high environment as well as CAT A and single engine performance. In addition to an enlarged rate of climb at sea level, the EC135 T3/P3 also offers an increased maximum-take-off- weight of 2,980 kg.

Customers and operators who flew the aircraft during the demonstration praised the helicopter’s noticeable improvements, saying that they could “immediately feel the difference” in comparison to the previous EC135 T2e/P2e version. They noted that “the additional power enhances safety” and offers “more reserve for emergency operations”. Others appreciated the “big step forward in performance, especially at high altitudes” as well as “the smoothness of the control” and the “stable hover” which is crucial for winching operations.

Among the enhancements integrated on this latest version of Airbus Helicopter’s light, multipurpose rotorcraft family are an enlarged main rotor, a modified air intake, modernization of the FADEC flight control software, cockpit innovations and enhanced interior versatility.

The T3/P3 designations signify the availability of two upgraded engine options on the helicopters: Turbomeca’s Arrius 2B2 “Plus” for the EC135 T3; and Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PWC 206B3 for the EC135 P3. Deliveries of EC135 T3/P3s will begin later this year.

More than 1,100 EC135s are in service worldwide, with a combined total of some three million recorded flight hours. Thanks to its versatility the EC135 is used for numerous missions including Police and Emergency Medical Services, the transport of private or business travelers, as well as advanced military training, maintenance of wind energy plants and transport flights for offshore platforms.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999996423721313}",positive,0.9999996423721313,1
Airbus wants to patent a bicycle-style airline seat - Fox News,"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtd2FudHMtdG8tcGF0ZW50LWEtYmljeWNsZS1zdHlsZS1haXJsaW5lLXNlYXTSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvYWlyYnVzLXdhbnRzLXRvLXBhdGVudC1hLWJpY3ljbGUtc3R5bGUtYWlybGluZS1zZWF0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just when you think that airline coach seats couldn’t get any tighter, Airbus has a concept that looks like an apparatus of torture rather than a perch for passengers.

The airplane manufacturer has filed a seat patent with a design that props passengers up in a narrow seat, and when the seats are unused, they fold vertically to save space. Cushions are shaped liked bicycle saddles and missing is what the patent application calls ""bulk"" –meaning the stuff taken up by cushions-- a tray table and a headrest.

The Washington Post dubbed the design the “Most Uncomfortable Plane Seats Ever.”

The idea is that passengers will put up with the discomfort for short haul flights and the seat design allows airlines do a lot more with the limited real estate on board.

""Reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours,"" Airbus writes.

But the designers know they can only go so far, especially when it comes to legroom.

"Airbus files patent for foldable, space-saving airplane seats that further reduce personal space - New York Daily News","Tue, 15 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy8xNS9haXJidXMtZmlsZXMtcGF0ZW50LWZvci1mb2xkYWJsZS1zcGFjZS1zYXZpbmctYWlycGxhbmUtc2VhdHMtdGhhdC1mdXJ0aGVyLXJlZHVjZS1wZXJzb25hbC1zcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Passengers flying coach aren’t left with much wiggle room now, but it may be possible to further diminish personal space on airplanes.

Plane manufacturer Airbus has filed a patent for small seats with short backrests that can fold up when not in use.

“In effect, to increase the number of cabin seats, the space allotted to each passenger must be reduced,” the patent application reads.

Gone are the tray tables and cumbersome seat cushions, which means even more passengers could be crammed in an aircraft for short flights. Instead, the diagrams show chairs that resemble bicycle saddles and the opportunity to get up close and personal with your neighbor.

The patent application goes on to say that the “reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours.”

Another way to pack more people onto planes would be to reduce the distance between two seats, the patent filing says.

But adds, “it is difficult to continue to further reduce this distance between the seats because of the increase in the average size of the passengers.”

Airbus said these space-saving seats may never be made.

“Many, if not most, of these concepts will never be developed, but in case the future of commercial aviation makes one of our patents relevant, our work is protected,” spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn told the Los Angeles Times. “Right now these patent filings are simply conceptual.”

How Much Does an Airbus A320neo Cost? - 24/7 Wall St.,"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS8yMDE0LzA3LzEzL2hvdy1tdWNoLWRvZXMtYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tY29zdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How Much Does an Airbus A320neo Cost?

American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) has chosen jet engines from CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and France’s Safran Group, to power a new fleet of single-aisle, narrow-body A320neo planes made by Airbus Group. London-traded EasyJet is also reported to have selected CFM as the engine supplier for its fleet of 100 A320neos.

American Airlines’ order is valued at $2.6 billion at list prices for the CFM Leap-1A, and the EasyJet order, which includes 35 engines for the current generation A320, would be worth about $3 billion. EasyJet is Europe’s second-largest low-cost carrier behind Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: RYAAY), which flies the 737 from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA).

Sunday’s announcement comes from the Farnborough International Airshow, which officially begins Monday, just outside London. We expect to hear announcements of new orders from both Boeing and Airbus, as well as regional jet makers Embraer S.A. (NYSE: ERJ) and Toronto-traded Bombardier. Airbus is also expected to announce a go/no-go decision on an A330neo during the show.

The A320neo is a re-engined version of Airbus’s best-selling A320 single-aisle, narrow-body jet. (The neo designation means new engine option.) The A320 competes directly against the Boeing 737, and the A320neo will go head-to-head with Boeing’s 737 MAX family. The list price of the A320neo is $102.8 million, compared with $85.7 million for the 737 MAX 7 and $103.7 million for the 737 MAX 8.

The currently available version of the A320 carries a list price of $94 million. The additional $8.8 million for the A320neo includes the more fuel-efficient engines, the wing sharklets and other refinements to the time-tested A320 aircraft.

Boeing took a page out of the Airbus book when it chose to re-engine its 737 rather than design a new plane from scratch. The Chicago-based company correctly figured out that a completely new plane would take at least twice as long to deliver and the company could not afford to let Airbus have that big a lead on sales, no matter how good the result turned out to be.

The order book for the A320neo already has 2,088 orders from 52 customers. The plane seats 150 passengers in two classes. The maximum range on the plane is about 4,250 miles, compared with around a 3,800-mile range for the A320.

The apparent loser in the competition for the announced engine contracts is Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UTX). American Airlines has already ordered CFM’s Leap-1B for its fleet of new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Both the A320neo and the 737 MAX are scheduled for delivery to American Airlines beginning in 2017.

Reflecting the flurry of activity around chalets in the first three days of the show, the biennial event has already outsold the 2012 show which saw $72 billion of orders and commitments. The tally hit $135 billion at last year's Paris Airshow.

Such deals range for provisional letters of intent to firm orders, and can include the announcement of transactions that may have been listed in order books to unidentified buyers.

Airbus has racked up around $60 billion in orders and commitments at the show, highlighted by this week's launch of the A330neo twin-aisle jet, a re-engined, more fuel-efficient version of its popular A330 series.

Boeing led the order race ahead of the event, gaining 649 net orders as of July 8 versus 290 for Airbus.

Do you already feel uncomfortable (read: claustrophobic and grumpy) when flying? Even first class can feel a bit cramped, depending on the aircraft, and it looks like that issue will only be getting worse. A patent filing has surfaced showing a design for standing airplane ""seats"".

The patent filing is from Airbus, and while said to only be a concept that won't necessarily be implemented into aircraft, it hints at a future in flight that will leave most everyone feeling uncomfortable. The diagram, featured below, shows a seat that looks akin to what you'd find on a tricycle.

The seat can be folded down, and behind it is a simple low-sitting backrest that can be adjusted upwards (though not enough to support your neck, by the look of things, so kiss napping through a flight goodbye). Next to the seat are two fold-up armrests.

Though the diagram shows the individual straddling the seat, make no mistake: this is a standing seat, providing no element beneath one's thighs to take the pressure off one's backside when sitting. The question now is, would you be willing to sit in one of these seats on a short flight in exchange for lower airfare? Drop us a comment!

Airbus strengthens A380 door seals - Professional Engineering,"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLWEzODAtZG9vci1zZWFsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to reinforce the door seals on up to 13 of its A380 aircraft after complaints about disturbing whistling noises and cabin depressurisation.

The problem, which forced an A380 to make an emergency landing in Baku, Azerbaijan, while en route from London to Singapore in January, affects 10% of the A380s around the world, said Tom Williams, executive vice-president of programmes at Airbus.

Williams said: “After Baku we were concerned about reinforcing the cover plate. It went into a high-frequency aerodynamic resonance which resulted in a tearing in the door seal. We realised that although with most there are no issues now, there may be in the future.”

The company issued a safety warning to airlines and deployed an ultrasonic test to expose the problem. All A380s in service have been checked.

“We’re not planning to replace the doors, instead we are going to reinforce them,” he added.

The A380 is the European aircraft-maker’s flagship wide-body plane, dubbed the “flying hotel” by customers because of its size. There are 132 A380s in service and 192 on order.

The company also announced at its Innovation Days event that it was just a year away from a prototype of a curved screen that could be used to replace windows on its aircraft. The prototype is being developed for the A380 and may be fitted in the domed section towards the upper rear of the aircraft, which is windowless because of its conical shape.

Champion, said the “sky terrace” concept had to be tested on the market before it was fully developed.

He said: “The idea is to compose an enhanced passenger outside view instead of a traditional window. We’re in the feasibility stage, which means that this could come live in the coming year. We’re engaged with the customers to see if we can have something after that.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5441202521324158}",neutral,0.5441202521324158,0
Airbus Helicopters' EC175 full-flight simulator is ready for service - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 08 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzZWMxNzVmdWxsZmxpZ2h0c2ltdWxhdG9yaXNyZWFkeWZvcnNlcnZpY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Level D full-flight simulator for Airbus Helicopters’ EC175 rotorcraft has received airworthiness certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), enabling launch pilots to be trained with this high-fidelity system.

“Safety and support are of the utmost importance to Airbus Helicopters. Our introduction of these training systems responds to customers’ needs and expectations ahead of the first EC175 deliveries later this year,” said Matthieu Louvot, head of Airbus Helicopters’ Support & Services. “Our investment in such resources will enable a rapid and smooth service entry for the EC175, followed by its successful operation for years to come.”

Located at the Helisim Training Academy adjacent to Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters and production facility at Marignane, France, the motion-based EC175 full-flight simulator incorporates a state-of-the-art visual projection system with a 210-deg. by 80-deg. continuous field of view.

The simulator was built by global technology firm Indra in close cooperation with Airbus Helicopters in its role as the EC175 manufacturer, and is equipped with the same data pack, avionics suite and automatic flight control system as the actual EC175 rotorcraft.

Utilizing a motion system, computer-generated visual scenes and accurate representations of cockpit instrumentation, the simulator allows specific mission scenarios to be “flown,” including landings on off-shore platforms for oil and gas operations – enabling the most realistic flight conditions for immersive training.

Initial EC175 simulator sessions with EC175 customers have already begun using an Indra fixed-base Flight Navigation Procedures Trainer (FNPT III), which will also be used for Oil and Gas training modules. Courses for mechanics and avionics technicians are also offered on a Practical Maintenance Training Device – which represents the full-scale aircraft.

In addition to the Europe-based training systems at Helisim, another EC175 Level D full-flight simulator will be located in the United States to serve the offshore oil and gas industry throughout the Americas.

Airbus Helicopters will begin EC175 deliveries later this year to the first customers, backed by the company’s commitment to provide a mature helicopter with a dedicated task force and tools that include validated support and services deliverables, as well as established training capabilities.

The EC175 was developed in close consultation with operators, providing a medium twin-engine helicopter suited for a wide range of missions – including offshore crew transport, search and rescue, private transport, utility, and medical evacuation operations. It features Airbus Helicopters’ new Helionix avionics suite and a digital four-axis autopilot that increases safety through reduced pilot workload, enhanced situational awareness, improved flight envelope protection and system redundancy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7511845231056213}",neutral,0.7511845231056213,0
Airbus's folding saddle seat could be the cattle-class future for cheap flights - The Guardian,"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9hcnRhbmRkZXNpZ24vYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLWRlc2lnbi1ibG9nLzIwMTQvanVsLzE3L2FpcmJ1cy1zYWRkbGUtc2VhdC1mdXR1cmUtY2hlYXAtZmxpZ2h0c9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9hcnRhbmRkZXNpZ24vYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLWRlc2lnbi1ibG9nLzIwMTQvanVsLzE3L2FpcmJ1cy1zYWRkbGUtc2VhdC1mdXR1cmUtY2hlYXAtZmxpZ2h0cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you thought low-cost air travel couldn't get any more bleak, then Airbus has a treat in store for you. The aeroplane manufacturer has now filed a patent for the what looks like a human battery-farm, but is in fact the future of budget flights: racks upon racks of folding saddle-seats for even more passengers to be jammed onto aeroplanes, packed in knee-to-rump.

While some airlines have already removed their folding tray tables and squeezed leg-room down to brutal knee-capping levels, Airbus have gone one step further, doing away with the idea of proper seating altogether. In their ultra-economy vision, seating aisles will instead take the form of long horizontal poles, from which bicycle-like saddles and small back and arm rests will pivot out, on to which humans will be placed, skewered together like table-football players.

“The design of the seats has to be optimised so that they present the smallest possible bulk,” says Airbus, explaining that the saddle-style seat has been developed “in order to reduce the distance needed to accommodate the legs of passengers between two rows of seating devices.”

The result, according to the patent diagram, is what looks like a line of people doing a sit-down conga, perching on each other's knees. There barely a whisker of airspace between their limbs, let alone anywhere to place their over-priced soggy sandwiches. And you can forget about having a nap, unless your neighbour has a particularly forgiving shoulder.

The design comes following increasing pressure from airlines for planes that pack even more people in. Ryanair has previously proposed standing-only sections, while other manufacturers have developed smaller loos that allow more seats to be squeezed in. The Boeing 777, originally designed for nine seats per row, now usually holds 10 abreast.

“It is now no longer possible to further reduce the seating width, particularly in economy class,” says Airbus. “It is also difficult to continue to further reduce the distance between the seats because of the increase in the average size of the passengers.” It admits that the folding saddles are not as comfortable as conventional airline seats, but that “this reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours”.

These folding perches represent the latest step in the increasing polarisation of air travel, where societal distinction is still physically enshrined by “class” – Virgin Atlantic’s “Upper Class” designation surely being the most obnoxious of the lot. News of the Airbus plunging the latest depths for the lower classes comes just weeks after Middle Eastern airline Etihad unveiled the highest stratosphere of luxury travel. “The Residence at Etihad” comprises a three-room VIP suite, with its own living room, double bedroom and en-suite shower, and comes with access to a Savoy-trained butler, gourmet chef and concierge. Curtained-off private prayer rooms are equipped with a real-time electronic Qibla-finder showing the exact direction of Mecca based on the aircraft's geographical position. As the sheikhs pray among the clouds, let's just hope they spare a thought for the rest of us skewered together down below.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997063279151917}",neutral,0.9997063279151917,0

James, who has been leading Airbus Helicopter’s Engineering Test Centre organisation in the company’s Donauworth and Marignane facilities, succeeds Markus Steinke to head up the U.K. branch of the world’s largest helicopter manufacturer.

Within Airbus Helicopter’s Research and Development directorate, James, aged 46, was responsible for engineering activities concerning Aircraft Vehicle and Systems Testing, Research and Development Simulation, Flight Training Devices, Systems Maintainability and Ground Support Products. He has been directly responsible for some of the company’s most noted flight and engineering test achievements in recent years.

A graduate of Staffordshire University, James started his professional career at Eurocopter in 1992 in the field of software development and integration on real time avionics systems. In 2001 he participated in the successful contract negotiations leading to the sale of the Tiger helicopter to Australia, and went on to manage the subsequent helicopter development contract, including the set-up of a local Australian Systems Support Centre. In 2006, he moved to France to manage the transnational engineering activities of Airbus Helicopters in the field of Communication and Navigation systems. Since 2009, he has been acting as vice president of engineering in his current perimeter, leading to his involvement in the development activities of all existing and new Airbus Helicopter aircraft types.

James’s background ensures that the U.K. is ideally placed to benefit from the most cutting-edge technology and know-how in the company, while his expertise and specialization will help to continue improving Airbus Helicopter UK’s products and services.

Markus Steinke, who has led the U.K. helicopter business for the last six years, will now move to Airbus Group Headquarters in Toulouse as vice president Post Merger Integration and Carve-Out Management. Airbus Helicopters thanks Steinke for his work, where he has consistently grown the business, successfully managed the integration of acquisitions, established Airbus Helicopters as domestic supplier to the U.K. MoD with the RAF Puma upgrade programme, and implemented innovative customer service solutions, such as the implementation of a dedicated Oil & Gas Service Center in Aberdeen. Steinke also extended Airbus Helicopters’ civil leadership into new mission segments, such as the first use of helicopters for windfarm maintenance in the U.K., all the while maintaining the company’s level of dedication to customers, as during the 2012 Olympic games in London, where Airbus Helicopters delivered 100 percent availability in air support.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996461868286133}",neutral,0.9996461868286133,0
This Airplane Seat Basically Looks Like a Torture Device - TIME,"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vMjk4NjQzMC9haXJidXMtc2VhdC1wYXRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airlines with Airbus planes in their fleets may soon find themselves flooded with annoyed passengers, likely to be shifty and uncomfortable as they sit on — or rather, mount — a never-before-seen airplane seat.

Airbus filed a patent application in June for a “seating device comprising a forward-foldable backrest,” or what appears to be a bike saddle meets ergonomic office chair meets movie theater seat. The patent states that the new seat will reduce bulk: the cushions and headrests have been eliminated, and armrests are smaller than usual. With the new seat, Airbus hopes to transport more passengers with its existing aircrafts in order to maximize return, as competitive low-cost airlines stake their ground by boarding travelers willing to trade comfort for affordability.

“In all cases, this increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers,” the patent states. “However, this remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours.”

The new patent, designed by Bernard Guering, seems to be the inventor’s latest contribution in the push to economize air travel. (Guering has already filed patents for deployable benches to accommodate baggage, storage compartments in the nose gear, and a crew hang-out spot in the plane’s tail.) But seats similar to Guering’s proposal, in fact, do already exist: the SkyRider, for example, debuted in 2010, but the saddle seat has not yet made its way onto planes. More radical ideas have been proposed, such as RyanAir’s standing “seat,” which faces an uphill battle with licensing and safety requirements.

Slimmer, lighter seats for Airbus planes were picked up by United Airlines in 2012.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997159838676453}",neutral,0.9997159838676453,0
Airbus patents windowless cockpit that would increase pilots' field of view - New Atlas,"Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3dpbmRvd2xlc3MtY29ja3BpdC1haXJidXMvMzI4MTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine showing up at the airport to catch your flight, looking at your plane, and noticing that instead of windows, the cockpit is now a smooth cone of aluminum. It may seem like the worst case of quality control in history, but Airbus argues that this could be the airliner of the future. In a new US patent application, the EU aircraft consortium outlines a new cockpit design that replaces the traditional cockpit with one that uses 3D view screens instead of conventional windows.

There’s a reason why cockpits are traditionally in the nose of a plane – not the least of which is the pilot being able to see where they're going. In addition to flying, being up front provides a clear view forward and downward for landing and taxiing. That’s all very useful, but it does tend to ruin the aerodynamics of the aircraft’s nose, which would ideally be lancet shaped. As aircraft have grown larger and more complicated, the nose has come to also include the radome, crew rest area and the front landing gear, and the current cockpit design reflects this.

Another problem is that aerospace engineers hate windows. They may be popular with passengers who like to see outside, and pilots, who like to not bang into things, but engineers see them as nothing but points of weakness in what should, ideally, be a solid cylinder. If nothing else, they’ll point to the alarming Comet airliner crashes of the 1950s, which were traced back to poor window design fatally weakening the fuselage. Windows mean heavy reinforcements and multiple layers of glass and plastic to strengthen hull integrity. In addition, placing the cockpit in the nose reduces the cabin size, where every inch is measured in thousands of dollars lost per flight.

Cockpit relocated into the nose frees up more space in the cabin

The Airbus patent shows a windowless cockpit that removes the windows or reduces them to partial views of the outside world. Instead, exterior views are provided by a display formed by back projection, lasers, holograms, or OLED imaging systems fed by cameras outside the fuselage. In addition, there are stereo cameras for taxiing and parking, and augmented reality can be used to highlight weather conditions, navigation beacons, air routes, hazards, and other information. There are even holographic displays of a globe displaying navigation and weather data, and a Star Wars-like holographic projector that Darth Vader would enjoy.

The idea of a windowless cockpit may seem a bit mad at first, but there are some real advantages if Airbus can pull it off and get the public to accept it. The proposed system widens the pilot’s field of view, which is always good, and provides more flexibility about what information is displayed and how it's displayed. It reduces the weight of the aircraft, therefore increasing fuel efficiency, and it increases the flexibility of aircraft design. Security can also be increased by making the cabin as hardened as possible – even separating it entirely from the passenger cabin.

At the moment, the windowless cockpit is just a concept, but if the public is willing to go along with it, the smooth airliner could be the plane of the future.

The Airbus ACJ319 Is So Luxurious It Gives You Wings - Haute Time,"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFjajMxOS1sdXh1cmlvdXMtZ2l2ZXMtd2luZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

The Telegraph recently published a video asking, “Is the Airbus ACJ319 the most luxurious private jet in the world?” Though it’s hard to be objective and declare this magnificent plane to be so, the ACJ319 is a monumental aircraft in the world of private luxury air lining.

Airbus ACJ319’s clientele alone proves that this is a plane for serious customers, “Our clientele consists of 2/3 billionaires, and then the last third mixed between companies and governments,” says David Velupillai, Airbus Marketing Director.

The airplane’s accommodations are commensurate with its clientele, incorporating the tallest and widest cabin of any business jet in the world. Whether you are holding meetings, relaxing or sleeping, or celebrating great success, the cabin provides enough room for all those activities to be going on by different people simultaneously.

Costing $87 million, the ACJ319 counts a number of governments among its clients, among those of Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic, Brazil Malaysia and Thailand. There are other governments that own the jet as well, but according to Velupillai many of them don’t want to be named as owners, perhaps (NOTE: speculation) due to connotations held by various publics about their governments flying around in near-$100 million jets.

The cabin can be specified to the needs of the individual clients. Maybe you like watching movies when you fly? Why not a personal airborne move theatre? Fancy yourself something of a foodie? How about a full-dining table catered by the finest foods you’ll find amongst the clouds. Flying can be nerve-racking, perhaps some drinks to mellow the angst, that’s fine as long as you have a fully stocked bar. An even better, the ACJ319’s cabin is so big at 80 square meters, or “About the size of a luxury apartment,” according to Velupillai, that you can have all three of these items with room to spare. Airbus is always very cognizant of how their clients live, “What customers are looking for is to give wings to their lifestyles,” says Velupillai, “That want somewhere to discuss business, someplace to have lunch, someplace to relax, perhaps a cinema, and certainly somewhere to sleep and to wash.”

Airbus hands decoration specificities over to the clients, allowing them to choose various fabrics that are used in the interior and even allowing them to hire their own interior designers.

Like all Airbus jets, the ACJ319 has the company’s common cockpit , “With the same layout of instruments and controls, plus similar handling qualities and procedures – making it easier for pilots to transition from one type to another, while saving time and money,” according to a press release by the company.



The Airbus ACJ319 is a corporate jet for those of the wealthy and powerful that for lack of a better term, hate flying. It’s so luxurious, spacious, and loaded with extras that one might feel like he/she is still back at their luxury apartment, conducting business, relaxing, and dining on fine foods.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999724626541138}",neutral,0.9999724626541138,0
"Airbus A330-800 and -900neo, first analysis part 2: engines and maintenance costs - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 15 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNy8xNS9haXJidXMtYTMzMC04MDAtYW5kLTkwMG5lby1maXJzdC1hbmFseXNpcy1wYXJ0LTItZW5naW5lcy1hbmQtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2UtY29zdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Further to our initial analysis of the launched Airbus A330neo, here is our follow up diving deeper into engine matters and maintenance costs.

The A330neo engine

We met with Rolls Royce Vice President Customer Marketing Richard Goodhead to talk about the Trent T7000 for the A330neo and to straighten some misconceptions around the engine. First the base facts as presented by Airbus and Rolls Royce Monday:

Ignoring for a moment the red box (our emphasis), the engine is a straight derivative of the Rolls Royce Trent T1000TEN from the Boeing 787. The thrust- generating parts of the engine sees no changes, thereby our speculation that we might see the application of Rolls Royce ALPS (Advanced Low Pressure System) CFRP fan blades and fan case did not happen. We asked Richard Goodhead why?

“Even if the ALPS programs composite parts would be ready to go into the T7000 we would not see the weight benefits we have projected as part of this program for an existing engine using the technology,” Goodhead says. “To gain the 150-200kg weight gains we talk about, one has to design the engine from scratch with the technology. Applying it to a T1000 derivative does not bring the necessary benefits. The ALPS technology will see first application in our Advance engine.”

We then addressed the misconception that the 787 engines had to be “converted to bleed engines,” as widely reported in the press. We have been arguing that this is indeed a misconception: the 787 engines, both GENx-1B and Trent T1000, as operated today on the 787 are bleed engines. They bleed about 20% of the core compressor air for engine/nacelle internal purposes. This internal need is present on all jet and turbofan engines. They thereby provide cooling air to turbine stators and blades and the different nozzles. They also provide air for the pressurizing of the engine’s many rotary seals, present at all turbine stages.

For this purpose, there are bleed ports on up to 50% of the compressor stages, tapping just the right pressure and temperature air to the engines different hot parts, low pressure compressor bleed serving the low pressure turbine, higher pressure compressor bleed serving the intermediate turbine and so on. Adding another 5%-7% of air on top of the 20% in order to supply air for cabin air conditioning and wing deice will not be a significant change, in fact it will not require any new bleed outlets on the engines core.

“I can confirm that adding cabin and deice bleed to the Trent T1000 will be one of the simpler tasks when creating the T7000,” Goodhead says. “In fact it will require minimal hardware changes and the additional bleed will affect the engines performance with less then 1/10 of a percent. There are other areas requiring more of our attention, such as the significant reduction in electrical power served to the A330neo airframe compared to the requirements of the 787. The reduction in the drive power to the gearbox where the aircraft’s electrical generators are attached will cause hardware changes on the engines internals. This and the changed mounting of the engine (compared to the mounting of the T700) are more significant challenges for us and Airbus .”

Another subject we covered was the engines maintenance cost. The red box in the slide talks about comparable economics for Total Care services and LLPs (Life Limited Parts in the engine). We asked Goodhead what this all means.

“It means that an airline ordering an A330ceo or A330neo will be offered similar prices for our Total Care maintenance including Life-Limited Parts.”

This is significant as engine maintenance costs constitutes about 2/3 of total maintenance costs and the 787 engines have higher maintenance costs, according to our market intelligence.

Airframe maintenance cost

To this leveled engine costs, Airbus adds further improvements to the airframe maintenance costs.

These include:

– extending the A checks to 2,000 hours flying time

– requiring 2C base checks at half the interval, now at 48 months

– elimination of certain fatigue sampling tasks

– conversion of the ceo’s pneumatic regulation of the airframe’s bleed air system to more reliable electronic regulation

Airbus is joining forces with its strategic partners to challenge one of 787’s strong points, its projected low life cycle maintenance costs.

Cash operating costs (the cash you pay for using the aircraft vs. leaving it parked)

If we look at the major cost positions for the A330neo’s Cash Operating Cost (COC) which can be affected by Airbus and its partners (crew costs is not within the OEMs domain to affect) we can summarize:

– Fuel costs. Rolls Royce and Airbus will lower these with 12% for long haul operations. For short to medium haul the improvement will range from none to the full 12% depending on stage length. The difference in fuel consumption between a 787 and a A330ceo is in the 11%-15% range so this difference all but disappears depending on model, range and payloads.

– Landing and underway fees. The A330-900neo has a lower Max Takeoff Weight (MTOW) than the 787-9 and these fees are governed by MTOW. Hence the -900neo will be charged lower fees than if the mission was flown with a 787-9. For the -800neo versus the 787-8 this picture reverses; the 787-8 has a lower MTOW.

– Maintenance costs. As described, the engine costs differences shall be virtually eliminated between a Rolls Royce equipped A330ceo and A330neo. It remains to be seen how this will affect the engine maintenance costs for the 787; logically these will come under further competitive pressure. The positive airframe maintenance costs difference for the 787 will now be further reduced and as before they constitute only about 1/3 of total maintenance cost.

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus is set to lose its only Japanese customer for the A380 superjumbo as Skymark Airlines prepares to cancel an order for six jets worth more than $2 billion (£1.18 billion), industry sources said on Monday.

The setback comes after Japan's third largest carrier swung into a loss for its latest financial year and raises new questions over the strength of the backlog for the world's largest airliner, which increasingly depends on one customer, Emirates.

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the threat to the Skymark order, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.

The news comes as aerospace sources say several other orders for the huge jetliner are already hanging in the balance, including 10 aircraft earmarked for Hong Kong Airlines.

Reuters reported earlier this month the Hong Kong carrier no longer wanted the jets after an associated leasing company struck an expanded deal to buy 70 smaller A320-family aircraft.

Since March the order has no longer been attributed to Hong Kong Airlines, but to an ""undisclosed"" customer, raising questions over its status, according to a review of Airbus data.

Airbus officials said at the Farnborough Airshow this month that the Hong Kong order remained on its order book.

Skymark was due to take delivery of its first A380 around the end of this year, but the airline said in June the delivery was pushed back by up to six months because of problems in fitting out the interior of the world's largest jetliner.

Industry sources say Skymark, which has reported its first loss in five years, faces a challenge in taking delivery of the A380s, which were worth around $350 million each at list prices when the carrier placed its firm order in 2011.

Airlines pay most of the cost of buying a jet on delivery.

No one at Skymark Airlines was available for comment.

The A380 has so far attracted little interest from low-cost carriers, which operate with fewer of the partnership agreements and loyalty programmes that help traditional network airlines sell tickets and make the 525-seat jet profitable.

Story continues

The Centre for Aviation (CAPA), an airlines consultancy, has warned that Skymark could encounter ""significant losses"" if it put the A380 into service without such agreements, and that the airline would need changes in strategy to make it viable.

Adding a new aircraft type adds cost and complexity in training, maintenance and spare parts. Even large airlines can take years and dedicate large teams to preparing for the huge jet.

Skymark, which mainly flies Boeing 737s, has already tested its flexibility by adding two leased wide-bodied A330s.

A380 BACKLOG

The four-engine, double-decker A380 was launched in 2000 as a solution to Europe's congested airports and the success of Boeing Co's 747.

But growth in demand for large twin-engine jets has weighed down sales, which also suffered because of technical problems and the financial crisis, during which many airlines avoided large-scale bets.

The notable exception is Dubai's Emirates, which has invested in 140 of the aircraft, more than five times the number ordered by the next largest customer, Singapore Airlines Ltd.

The Dubai airline has said the A380 has unbeatable economics when configured correctly, and has asked Airbus to come up with a more efficient version with new engines from end-decade.

But the remaining backlog of 135 aircraft, of a net total of 324 ordered so far, includes several smaller orders that analysts say look increasingly unlikely to be delivered - at least to the airlines that originally purchased them.

Besides the aircraft originally earmarked for Hong Kong Airlines, these include a remaining eight for cash-strapped Qantas Airways Ltd, six that Virgin Atlantic has said it may further delay, two for Reunion-based Air Austral, and one originally sold as a flying palace to a Saudi prince.

Despite the setbacks, leasing company Amedeo has ordered 20 superjumbos in the belief there is an untapped market for A380s in a denser and more efficient cabin layout.

While Airbus tries to steady the backlog for its largest jetliner, it faces continued technical headaches from the complex aircraft such as a recent problem with leaking or noisy doors.

Airbus said at this month's UK air show that it was testing a solution after a recent diversion and several incidents involving noise onboard and expected it to be ready this year.

But influential customer Qatar Airways has raised concerns about the doors at the same time as refusing to take the first three aircraft because of what it describes as problems with the cabin, two people familiar with the matter said.

Airbus has said it is confident of reaching its target of 30 A380 deliveries this year, including the aircraft for Qatar.

The preferred rotorcraft among two other bidders was the proven EC145.

“Our EC145 has already been very successful as a medical helicopter in Moscow, with three operated by Moscow Aviation Centre, saving around 600 lives each year,” said Laurence Rigolini, Airbus Helicopters Vostok general manager. “The Airbus Helicopters story in Russia actually started with a medical helicopter we delivered for the EMERCOM back in 2006, and we are very happy that our products have remained the backbone of the local medevac fleet over these years. We look forward to delivering two more EC145 helicopters to Moscow, and we thank our customers for their long-lasting confidence in our team,” Rigolini commented.

The tender documentation requires two new medical helicopters to be delivered in 2015 and to be equipped with an oxygen tank, resuscitator, and defibrillator, as well as with a reanimation complex and neonatal intensive treatment (including incubator and lung ventilator for newborns). The deliveries are expected as early as next year.

The multi-purpose light twin-engine EC145 is a worldwide bestseller as a medical emergency rotorcraft. Worldwide deliveries exceed a total of 650 units, of which the medical fleet accounts for about 30 percent. The EC145 is equipped with two powerful and reliable Turbomeca Arriel1E2 engines and a modern hingeless rotor system, which together provide outstanding performance and vital power reserves even in one-engine-inoperative scenarios. Its spacious cabin allows transportation of up to two patients on stretchers and accompanying medical personnel with all necessary emergency equipment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9992876648902893}",positive,0.9992876648902893,1

Plans for the A350 were originally based on the fuselage of the existing A330, but following a redesign it was renamed the A350 XWB (extra wide body).

Its cabin measures five inches wider than the Boeing B787 Dreamliner, one of the aircraft (along with the B777) with which the A350 will compete.

The A350 XWB family will eventually comprise of three variants — the launch -900 version, the shorter -800, and the longer -1000.

Airbus says that the A350 XWB will offer a 25 per cent step change in fuel efficiency compared to the B777, and will burn 9 per cent less fuel for every seat offered than the Boeing Dreamliner.

As at the end of March, Airbus has so far received 812 firm orders for the A350 across 39 airlines, with launch customer Qatar Airways having ordered the most aircraft at 80, followed by Singapore Airlines with 70, and Etihad Airways with 62. Emirates ordered 70 of the aircraft in 2007, but this order was cancelled in June (see news, June 11).

The first test A350 XWB aircraft took to the skies last summer (see news, June 2013), and the aircraft made its full international debut at the Singapore Airshow in February.

A special test aircraft bearing the Qatar Airways livery flew above Toulouse in March (see news, March 2), and the carrier plans to take the A350 XWB, along with an A380 and revamped A320, to the Farnborough Airshow in July (see news, February 17).

None of the carriers have yet publicly confirmed seating configuration for their A350 aircraft, and although Airbus’ preferred layout is nine across in economy with a seat width of 18 inches (see news, April 7), one airline has already ordered the ten-abreast”high efficiency” configuration.

The image below shows options for either four, six or seven across in business class (1-2-1, 2-2-2, or 2-3-2), eight across in premium economy (2-4-2) and either nine or ten across in economy (3-3-3 or 3-4-3).

The recently merged LATAM Airlines Group this month unveiled the unified cabin design for its B787 and A350 aircraft (see above image), the latter of which it is schedule to start taking delivery of next year (see news, April 4). Note we don’t yet have a seatplan released by LATAM.

To date the only UK carrier to have placed a firm order for the A350-XWB is British Airways, through its parent company IAG (see news, April 2013).

The airline has ordered 18 A350-1000s, with an option on a further 18, and the first aircraft is expected to be delivered around 2018.

Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus also has nine A350-900 aircraft on order.

REUTERS/Nancy Wiechec

TOKYO (Reuters) - Airbus Group NV (AIR.PA) said on Tuesday it has terminated an agreement to deliver six A380 superjumbo jets to Skymark Airlines Inc after the Japanese discount carrier struggled to raise enough cash to pay instalments on the aircraft.

In a briefing in Tokyo before Airbus's announcement, Skymark's CEO and chief investor, Shinichi Nishikubo, said that the European aircraft maker had refused to consider changes to the 2011 purchase agreement, including reducing the number of aircraft or offering smaller jets and had notified it of the termination in a faxed message on Sunday.

""We didn't get the chance to sit down and have a formal discussion,"" Nishikubo said.

The termination marks a setback for Airbus in Japan after it won its first order ever from Japan Airlines (JAL) last year which agreed to buy more than 30 A350 jets.

The European company has struggled to win market share from rival Boeing Co (BA.N) which dominates with around an 80 percent market share helped by strong ties to local aircraft makers like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , which make major portions of its jetliners.

Losses incurred at Skymark as it grapples to win market share from Japan's two dominant carriers, ANA Holdings and JAL, meant it was unable to convince lenders to finance the purchase of the six A380s. It had planned to use them for a discount business-class only international flights.

Skymark is unlikely to recover 26 billion yen (150 million pounds) in instalments it has already paid to Airbus, Nishikubo said. He plans to hold talks with Airbus regarding cancellation fees, he added.

The Skymark cancellation means that no Japanese carrier will now fly the A380. Both JAL and ANA have said they are not interested in buying the largest class of passenger aircraft.

Orders for the A380 are hanging in the balance elsewhere, according to aerospace sources, including 10 aircraft earmarked for Hong Kong Airlines.

Reuters reported this month the Hong Kong carrier no longer wanted the jets after an associated leasing company struck an expanded deal to buy 70 smaller A320-family aircraft.

Story continues

Since March the order has not been attributed to Hong Kong Airlines, but to an ""undisclosed"" customer, raising questions over its status, according to a review of Airbus data.

Officials for the aircraft maker said at the Farnborough Airshow this month that the Hong Kong order remained on its order book.

The four-engine, double-decker A380, which is listed at $350 million, was launched in 2000 as a solution to Europe's congested airports and as a rival to Boeing's 747.

But growing demand for large twin-engine jets has sapped demand, while sales have also been hurt by technical problems and the financial crisis, during which many airlines avoided large-scale purchases.

Airbus Defence and Space unveils unique training tool for helicopter pilots - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2RlZmVuY2VhbmRzcGFjZXVudmVpbHN1bmlxdWV0cmFpbmluZ3Rvb2xmb3JoZWxpY29wdGVycC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space is to unveil a unique training tool called Sferion that has been developed to support helicopter pilots flying in degraded visual environment (DVE) conditions.

Sferion has been developed for both military and civil helicopter use and provides training to help support pilots during their entire mission under all conditions.

Search and Rescue (SAR) teams and Special Operation Forces flying helicopters face a number of safety challenges because they have to fly at low altitudes and also in degraded visual environments (DVE), such as brown-out, white-out, and zero-light conditions.

Obstacles in the flight path or close to the flight path can be a threat to helicopters. They could include power lines, aerial cables, pylons, single trees and towers. The threat of collision increases when the pilot has to fly low level and or in DVE such as brown-out, white-out and zero light conditions.

A night mission poses a number of challenges for Search and Rescue teams and Special Operation Forces flying helicopters. These include the fact there may be short time for pre-planning, even with known co-ordinates the terrain and conditions at the landing site may be unknown. Reconnaissance and tactical information may not be complete.

DVE is a constant threat and sudden changes in weather conditions may bring on a snow storm, heavy rain or fog. It may also not be possible to do a fly-by for reconnaissance so the pilot needs to find and select a suitable landing spot at the first approach, possibly in DVE. The Sferion training software can process and combine information from advanced sensors, information from databases and information arriving via data links and present it in a practical, easy to understand visual format.

In DVE, a special system set up in the helicopter can generate visual clues for the pilot. In the most extreme cases the pilot can fly the helicopter while it would be impossible to fly without the visual aids. The result is better flight safety and certainty of mission success.

Sferion will be demonstrated today at Farnborough 2014 in the Airbus Defence and Space exhibition hall.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9663445353507996}",neutral,0.9663445353507996,0

""We will wait for Airbus to provide us with all the performance data and, most importantly, the price,"" he told the Wall Street Journal at the Farnborough International Airshow 2014.

Originally to have launched in June this year, Al Maha has pushed back it proposed launch date until later in the year pending the issuance of its Air Operator Certificate by the General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia (GACA).

With an initial fleet of A320-200s, Al Maha will operate domestic flights out of its Riyadh hub.

Meanwhile, al Baker has told a press conference at Farnborough that his airline will seek compensation from Airbus for delays in the delivery of three A380-800s.

""No amount of compensation will compensate any airline for the revenue loss an aircraft delay causes to its bottom line,"" al Baker said without mentioning exact figures.

During pre-delivery checks at Toulouse Blagnac, the airline reportedly found deficiencies in the aircraft interior warranting a full redecoration of the affected parts - most notably, the galley area.

The CEO also showed irritation at the European manufacturer's decision to exhibit a testbed A380 instead of the Qatar Airways model. While Airbus had said it would not do so given the rework being done to the airline's A380s, Al Baker claimed it was simply an attempt at ""bullying"" Qatar Airways into accepting the aircraft.

""This was absolutely disappointing to Qatar Airways,"" Al Baker said. “But I don’t think that that was the excuse. I think it was a way to pressure Qatar Airways to take delivery of the aircraft.

Dubbed the A330-800neo and A330-900neo, two new aircraft will incorporate latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, aerodynamic enhancements and new cabin features.

Benefitting from the economics, versatility and reliability of the A330, the A330neo reduces fuel consumption by a claimed 14 per cent per seat, making it one of the most cost efficient, medium range wide body aircraft in the market.

The A330neo will also have an increase of range up to 400 nautical miles. Deliveries of the A330neo will start in Q4 2017.

Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group said that the A330 is a very important margin (profit) contributor for Airbus. “It’s also one of the most reliable and efficient commercial aircraft ever. Customers love it. With our decision to re-engine the plane, we will keep the A330 flying high for many more years to come.”



In addition to the new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the A330neo will feature incremental innovations, including aerodynamic enhancements such as new winglets, an increased wing span and new engine pylons.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Airbus kicks off A350 route-proving trials | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1hMzUwLXJvdXRlLXByb3ZpbmctdHJpYWxzLzExNDAwNC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today began a three-week route-proving campaign using the fifth A350-900, marking the start of the final certification stage for the new twinjet.

A350 MSN5, which is equipped with a furnished cabin comprising 265 seats, will operate a “world tour” taking in 14 airports across the world and a route via the North Pole, says Airbus.

Tests will include performance from high-altitude airfields, automatic landings, as well as airport turnaround and handling, to prove the Rolls-Royce XWB-powered aircraft is ready for airline operations.

The programme is one of the final trials required for type certification, which the airframer expects during the third quarter, ahead of the first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways towards the end of this year.

Route-proving flights will be operated by Airbus crews with participation from airworthiness-authority pilots from the European Aviation Safety Agency. Some flights will be flown with passengers on board, says Airbus.

The programme will comprise four trips, each of which begins in Toulouse. Trip one will operate to Iqaluit in Canada and then return via Frankfurt. Trip two will operate to Asia, with several Singapore-Hong-Kong sectors being flown, before returning to Toulouse.

The third sortie will circumnavigate the globe east-bound from Toulouse via Johannesburg, Sydney, Auckland, Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo. The fourth and final trip will operate to Perth via Doha, and return via Doha, Moscow and Helsinki. The Doha flights are expected to involve Qatar Airways.

Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport operator states that the A350 is due to arrive in the Russian capital on 11 August, coinciding with the anniversary of the airport's opening in 1959.

Five development aircraft are participating in the A350 flight-test campaign, which has accumulated over 540 flights and 2,250 flight hours to date.

Airbus bets on timely take-off for A350 despite past delays - Financial Times,"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2NjNTk1NDA4LWY2ZjEtMTFlMy04ZWQ2LTAwMTQ0ZmVhYmRjMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

So far, so good. The Airbus A350, the European aircraft maker’s first new passenger jet in seven years, and its most sophisticated aircraft yet, is on course to enter commercial service at the end of this year with Qatar Airways .

Analysts regard the wide-body A350 as the single biggest risk at the passenger jet subsidiary of Airbus. This is because new aircraft programmes by the Toulouse-based company and Boeing , its chief rival, have a track record of running up large cost over-runs and delays that badly hurt the companies’ profitability.

The A350 is running up to 18 months behind schedule. That, however, is half the slippage faced by the 787 Dreamliner made by Boeing of the US.

So, Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus’s commercial business, may yet win the “bet” he placed in a Financial Times interview in 2012 that the A350 would not encounter delays similar to those endured by the wide-body Dreamliner.

Airbus remains haunted by the delays and production problems that accompanied the launch of its A380 superjumbo. It is determined to avoid a repetition with the A350.

The A380 entered service in 2007. Airbus had struggled with early production of the complex aircraft partly because of divisions inside the company that reflected rivalries between its French and German workers. Those divisions appear to have been resolved but the A380 programme remains lossmaking. The project is due to break even only next year.

The A350’s series of test flights began in June last year. Airbus has been able to stick to a challenging timetable partly because extensive reviews of the aircraft were done beforehand on the ground.

These ground tests are one key reason that Airbus is aiming for a 14-month period from first flight last year to granting by regulators of an airworthiness certificate. This compares with 20 months for the A380.

With the A350, “what has pleased me most [is that] we have initiated a lot of ground testing,” says Fernando Alonso, the Airbus executive in charge of flight testing. “We have made significant improvements relative to other [aircraft] programmes.”

Mr Alonso adds that the test flights identified some problems, including with the doors for the landing gear and with software that controls the brakes. “All these are normal – that is why we do flight tests,” he says. “We have not found anything ‘Oh my God, I don’t know how to handle this’.”

What has pleased me most [is that] we have initiated a lot of ground testing

But even though the path to A350 certification and entry into service appears open, some analysts, such as Douglas Harned at Bernstein, say there are bigger potential pitfalls after that, notably with the plans that Airbus has to increase production of the aircraft to 10 per month by 2018.

This is daunting not just for Airbus, but also for its supply chain because the A350, like Boeing’s Dreamliner, represents a step-change in technology – it is mainly made from lightweight carbon fibre reinforced plastic rather than traditional aluminium, in order to reduce fuel burn.

In May, Harald Wilhelm, Airbus group’s finance director, said the company had not accepted certain items from Spirit AeroSystems , a US aerospace company that manufactures part of the A350’s fuselage. He suggested this was because the particular components in question were not of the required quality.

“We don’t want to have mess in our factory,” he said in response to an analyst’s question. “And that I think explains what we observe on the Spirit side.”

Spirit said it was “proud” to work on the A350, adding the programme was still in its development phase. “We are working through some issues that are common to all development programmes. We will continue to support [Airbus] as [production] rates increase on this programme.” Airbus said Spirit’s fuselage sections were now in an “increasingly better shape”.

One thing is clear. Even if Airbus manages to press the A350 into service on time, the challenges are far from over and the programme is not due to become profitable until towards the end of the decade.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999598264694214}",negative,0.9999598264694214,-1
Hawaiian Airlines to add revamped Airbus A330 jet to fleet - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFkZC1yZXZhbXBlZC1haXJidXMtMjMyNjA4NDcyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Reuters) - Hawaiian Airlines said on Tuesday it plans to add a revamped version of the Airbus A330 jetliner to its fleet beginning in 2019 as it looks to expand to longer-haul destinations.

The carrier said it signed an agreement to acquire six widebody A330-800neo planes, with rights to buy six more. The list-price value of the six planes and the purchase rights add up to about $2.9 billion.

The order for the A330neo, which will have new, more fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines, replaces an existing order for six A350XWB-800 planes, Hawaiian said.

Hawaiian's A350-800 order was seen as one of the main remaining obstacles to halting the slow-selling A350-800, which Airbus wants to stop developing in favor of the revamped A330neo and the larger A350-900.

Hawaiian, which also has Boeing planes in its fleet, had said earlier this month it was prepared to look at the A330neo.

The airline also reported on Tuesday that strong demand and cost controls helped net income for the second quarter more than double to $27.3 million, or 43 cents a share, from $11.3 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted for items, profit was 35 cents a share, compared with 33 cents expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Quarterly operating revenue rose about 8 percent to $575.7 million.

""Rumours of a deal are unfounded,"" an Airbus spokesman told Reuters, but added, ""We are always in talks with our customers."" Bloomberg said the deal could be announced as early as next week at the Farnborough International Airshow, adding that while IndiGo had talked with Boeing Co , the airline's preference was to stick with Airbus. Sakshi Batra, a spokeswoman for IndiGo, declined to comment on the report. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Airbus is sprinting to line up preliminary orders for a revamped version of its A330 jet and is on stand-by to make an announcement at Farnborough.
