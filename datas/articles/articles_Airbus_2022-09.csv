Solar power beams: a step towards cleaner energy - Airbus,"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWJlYW1zLWEtc3RlcC10b3dhcmRzLWNsZWFuZXItZW5lcmd50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beaming solar power could help Europe access more renewable energies, in an independent way. Airbus has now demonstrated how this new technological concept could work in its X-Works Innovation Factory.

Everything is illuminated, thumbs up. Jean-Dominique Coste, Yoann Thueux and their colleagues have just shown decision-makers from politics and industry the inner workings of a new energy concept, which had until now only been on the radar of die-hard tech experts: Power Beaming.

The underlying principle is quite simple, explains Jean-Dominique Coste, who is responsible for this technology driven by Airbus’ Central Research & Technology and Blue Sky departments: “The potential of the technology is to capture sunlight and then beam it wirelessly.” On Earth, this solar energy would then supply cities, factories, households and eventually aeroplanes with electricity.

New energy networks in the sky

Not least for this reason, Coste says, power beaming could offer Europe and other parts of the world huge potential to tap into renewable energy sources and contribute to the goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050. ""Power beaming technologies would enable the creation of new energy networks in the sky and could help solve the energy problem,"" Coste says. ""They would enable countries to fully control and distribute their energy where needed, independently.""

The demonstration at Airbus' X-Works Innovation Factory on 27 September 2022 was a success, albeit on a smaller scale: using microwave beaming, Coste, Thueux and their colleagues transmitted green energy between two points representing ‘Space’ and ‘Earth’ over a distance of 36 metres, producing green hydrogen and bringing a model city to life. “Now that we have successfully tested the key bricks of a future space-based solar power system on a small scale for the first time, we are now ready to take Power Beaming to the next level”, says Yoann Thueux.

The demo was undoubtedly a success, but how will the technology work in real life? ""We are looking at a number of designs,"" explains Thueux. One thing, however, is already clear: If satellites were to collect the sunlight, they would need to measure about 2 kilometres across to achieve the same power level as a nuclear power plant.”

Independent and sustainable power supply around the clock

The advantages of collecting solar power in space are obvious, says Thueux: ""Outside the Earth's atmosphere, the sun's light is available indefinitely, not just during the day and in good weather like on Earth, plus it’s about 50 percent more intense."" For example, in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometres above Earth, a solar panel the same size as one of its counterparts on Earth can generate significantly more electricity.

The power collected would be beamed down over a wide area in a safe and controlled manner. Back on Earth, a large number of antennas spread over a wide area, even off-shore, would pick up the beams and the energy would be reassembled to produce electricity. ""The beams pass through clouds easily so loss of power is minimal. Also, the technology can be designed to prevent harm to birds or people flying in aircraft,"" assures Coste. Moreover, there is no need for complex and costly ground infrastructure, power plants, pipelines or cables, for example, to distribute the electricity on Earth. That, too, is done by Power Beaming.

Coste estimates that the levelised costs of energy would be the same as those of large-scale energy projects on Earth such as nuclear power plants, oil rigs and large renewable farms. Costs, though, would decrease as more power factories are built, due to economies of scale. One geostationary solar farm would generate about 2 gigawatts of electricity - the equivalent of one large fossil fuel or nuclear power station on Earth.



Power Beaming: a reality in 10 years?

By the early 2030s, the first operating Power Beaming prototypes could be in use. But there is still work to be done. A major area of research concerns the overall efficiency: getting as much energy as you can from what you harness. “We advocate a stepped approach to scale the system: from the ground, to aerial systems, then in space”, explains Jean-Dominique Coste, adding: “This could in fact be a game changer for aircraft, with the potential to extend the range, reduce the weight, but also to relay power to other places, managing energy like data. This has raised a lot of interest in the energy sector. In the end this will be a joint effort with institutions and the energy industry."""
Airbus and Boeing Report August 2022 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTkvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LWF1Z3VzdC0yMDIyLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Weak Post-Farnborough Order Intake. Boeing to Remarket Aircraft Earmarked for Chinese Customers.

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 35 and 41 commercial jets in August 2022, compared to 22 and 40 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Year to date, Boeing and Airbus have delivered 277 and 382, aircraft compared to 206 and 384, respectively, in the first eight months of 2021. So far this year, Boeing is 71 deliveries ahead of last year’s totals and Airbus is two deliveries behind.

Following a more than challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. 2022 is well underway to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, despite supply chain challenges and events currently unfolding in Ukraine. Boeing and Airbus still have a long way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels, though.

For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 in 2020 and 380 in 2019. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite Dreamliner quality issues and 777X delays, the outlook is mostly bright. Dreamliner deliveries have resumed and the 737 MAX is approved to fly in nearly every country. The aircraft, however, has not yet returned to commercial service in China despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ungrounded the 737 MAX in December of last year. Recently, it was announced that Boeing will begin to remarket some 737 MAX jets earmarked for Chinese customers. Ongoing political tensions between the United States and China are impeding deliveries, and Boeing is facing perhaps its most difficult situation since entering the Chinese market half a century ago. Chinese airlines are no longer ordering its jets and hundreds of new aircraft cannot be delivered to Chinese customers. On top of that, Boeing is stuck with a completions and delivery center in Zhoushan that it has no need for until the political situation improves. The Zhoushan plant was scaled to accommodate 100 aircraft annually.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in August 2022, Boeing delivered 35 jets, including 28 737s (27 MAX / 1 NG), two 767s, three 777s, and two 787s. Since June of this year, the 737 program is producing aircraft at an official rate of 31 per month, up from 27. The rate of 27 per month was maintained between November 2021 and May 2022 and, prior to that, the monthly rate was just 19. Despite the recent 737 rate increase, ongoing supply chain issues are likely to persist for the time being. Boeing had been considering a boost in 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023, followed by another increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023, but these plans have now been postponed. In connection with the release of Boeing’s second quarter 2022 earnings, President and CEO David Calhoun commented, “But I do believe we’re at a state now where at 31, we are comfortable the industry can get there and maybe has already gotten there, and then we are going to watch as they qualify more capacity going forward before we pull those rates up.” At present, Boeing’s main supply chain headache is its engine supply.

On August 10, deliveries of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were resumed following a suspension of shipments that lasted nearly 16 months. The aircraft was delivered to American Airlines, which received its first Dreamliner since April 2021. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The current 787 production rate is two aircraft per month, and Boeing expects to continue at this rate for now but will likely return to five per month over time. In March of this year, it was reported that the company was testing the ability of suppliers to meet output scenarios as high as seven per month by the end of 2023. Boeing has approximately 120 787s currently awaiting delivery. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that it will inspect each aircraft before issuing airworthiness certificates.

The 777 program was expected to get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X, but in April Boeing announced this will now not happen before 2025. This reflects an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. According to Boeing, the 777-9 production rate ramp-up is being adjusted to minimize inventory and the number of planes requiring “change incorporation,” including a temporary pause through 2023. However, Boeing is taking advantage of the adjustment to the 777-9 production schedule by adding 777 freighter capacity starting in late 2023. In January of this year, Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter, thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In August 2022, Airbus delivered 41 jets, including 33 A320s (all NEO), two A330s, and six A350s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by early 2024 (recently pushed back from mid-2023 due to supply chain challenges). Also, Airbus is working with its supply chain to increase the A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month in 2025. The A321XLR successfully accomplished its first flight on June 15, 2022. Entry into service, initially planned for the end of 2023, is now expected to take place in early 2024.

The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of six aircraft per month, up from five at the beginning of the year – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and was expected to be increased to six by early 2023. However, the rate increase may be delayed until the end of 2023 due to sanctions on Russia and a legal fight between Airbus and Qatar Airways over A350 paint/surface issues. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that is expected to be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021, Airbus launched the A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F, 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November of last year and will predominantly compete with the 777F and later the 777X freighter. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). To date, the A350F has accumulated 31 net new orders.

Turning to the August orders review, both companies had a quiet month, which is a normal pattern in the months following the major airshows. Boeing booked orders from five customers for a total of 30 jets. However, the company also reported four cancellations (all 737 MAX), resulting in 26 net new orders. An undisclosed customer ordered 11 737 MAX jets, while UPS placed an order for eight 767 freighters. Also in August, AerCap booked five 787-9 Dreamliners and the Israeli military placed an order for four KC-46 tankers (767-2C). Finally, American Airlines ordered two 737 MAXs. Year to date, Boeing has accumulated 338 net new orders (446 gross orders). In 2021, Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). Please note that for comparison reasons, we do not include the so-called ASC 606 accounting adjustments in the numbers reported in this article and regard net new orders as gross orders minus cancellations.

In August, Airbus did not book any orders but reported 19 cancellations (all A350-1000s). Year to date, Airbus has accumulated 637 net new orders (843 gross orders) surpassing both 2021 gross orders and net new orders. In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments were included, Boeing would have come out ahead with 535 net new orders.

At the end of August 2022, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,339 jets, of which 6,699, or 91 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 386 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of August, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,206 aircraft, of which 4,185, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.5 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 12.0 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.5 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.3 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 1.22. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is a solid 1.67. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

2022 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast data from the Civil Aircraft Forecast product. For 2022, Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 448 and 666 commercial jets, respectively. Compared to the 2021 level, this is a 31.8 percent increase for Boeing and a 9.0 percent increase for Airbus.

Boeing released second quarter 2022 results on July 27 and expects to finish the year with 737 MAX deliveries in the low 400s. Airbus released Q2 2022 earnings on July 27 and lowered its 2022 guidance from 720 deliveries to 700. As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, and its own internal operations.

"Airbus' A350 NPS variant: lower weight, more MTOW—and bigger cabin - Runway Girl Network","Thu, 08 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbnBzLXZhcmlhbnQtbXRvdy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is planning to transition the A350-900 and -1000 to what it calls a “new production standard” (NPS) between now and 2024, reducing airframe weight, improving performance and making the cabin longer — and wider.

After developing this story in 2019 and confirming it last year, Runway Girl Network spoke in depth with Airbus’ vice president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer and head of aircraft interiors marketing Anaïs Marzo, diving into substantial detail about the plans.

At the airframe level, the NPS A350s bring a significant weight reduction of up to 1.2t, a 3t maximum takeoff weight increase, and enhanced performance. In the cabin, they offer an extra 35” of cabin length from moving the rear bulkhead and adjusting the arrangement of the flight deck, forward crew rest and forward monuments — and, most controversially, expect to add up to thirty extra seats gained from a four-inch wider cabin, secured by changing the way the airframe itself is constructed and connected.

The NPS’ weight reduction comes, Anaïs Marzo says, “because we’ve been optimising structures and systems: for example, brackets, electrical systems, and wiring, and also increasing the use of advanced materials. This means basically more carbon fibre use, mainly in the fuselage, as well as the wings.”

In terms of performance, Marzo emphasises, “there is no physical change to the aeroplane. In fact, there is a software change in order to improve the way in which you can control flaps during takeoff, and increasing the number of positions, in order to improve performance at challenging airports or in difficult conditions.”

A system enabling faster landing gear retraction also increases performance, and overall the maximum takeoff weight increases from 280–283t on the A350-900 and 316–319t on the A350-1000.

Within the cabin, it’s a question of width and length

In terms of cabin width, Airbus is changing the very frames of the NPS aircraft, and how they connect together, to enable the interior of the cabin to fit two inches more closely to the inside of the aircraft’s fuselage on either side. Marzo refers to this as “frame sculpting”.

This allows a total of four inches more cabin width at armrest level, with an Airbus diagram showing additional space of approximately two inches per side from armrest to roughly mid-thigh, and a smaller amount of additional space between the tops of the windows and the overhead bins.

This will allow Airbus, Marzo and Wuggetzer say, to offer 17”-wide seats with a 1.5” armrest width and 17” aisle — up from 16.7” per seat with a 1.8” armrest on the aisle, 1.5” armrests elsewhere, and a 15.67” aisle. The mathematics, an Airbus table seen by RGN says, bring a cabin of 223.5 inches for the NPS ten-abreast compared with 219.4 for the previous generation.

Longtime readers of RGN will remember Ingo Wuggetzer standing in Airbus briefing rooms citing ten-abreast A350 seats as 16.4” wide in the last decade or so, so the proof will be in the physical pudding of these seats — and of course in which airlines, and which kind of airlines, decide that this very tight 17” seat with the tiny armrests is acceptable for their economy class brand. It seems that even full-service carriers are going in this direction, even possibly Etihad, rather than just what Airbus executives as recently as 2019 were referring to as a standard below mainstream economy on low-cost and leisure carriers like French bee and Air Caraïbes.

There remain, of course, some airlines that took a stand on ten-abreast 777s, some five inches wider than the new A350 even in their current-generation pre-777X version, which itself will have newly sculpted sidewalls. For these airlines, which will retain nine-abreast in the new production standard, Airbus is citing 18.7”-wide seats with a 17” aisle and 1.8” armrests as one example of how airlines could choose to pass around the extra four inches between passengers.

In premium economy, where the A350’s current eight-abreast layout is the least generous in the sky, this now enables an example of 19” seats with an 18” aisle, a 5” centre console and a 1.8” single armrest width. In business class, Airbus is already working with seatmakers to optimise the use of the additional 4”.

Extra space in front and rear galleys is great news

Beyond the seats, cabin crew — and therefore passengers — will be relieved to find additional space in the forward and rear galleys, enabling smoother service and more innovation in this area, where the A350 has come in for some criticism.

Behind doors 4, Airbus has pushed the rear pressure bulkhead of the aircraft backwards by one full frame, bringing 24” of extra space into play behind the doors. In this space, Airbus is now offering either a large new “V-Shape XL Galley” or the “ICE [Increased Cabin Efficiency] XL”, with the latter offering a smaller galley space but one lavatory on either side of the aircraft. Each of these adds six full trolleys of capacity, plus the workspace and galley insert space above them — a notable feat.

At the front of the NPS aircraft 1, Marzo explains, Airbus has optimised the space in two ways. First, the bulkhead with the crew cabin control unit and the two flight attendant seats at door 1L has been moved a few inches closer to the door. Second, the fourth seat in the flight deck has been swapped from floor-mounting to wall-mounting, enabling the flight deck wall to be pushed forwards five inches.

Ahead of 1L, there is thus either the option of a new four-trolley galley — up from three trolleys — with extra insert space, or a 50-inch premium lavatory that Airbus claims is PRM compliant. (Airbus has questionable form on what “PRM compliant” might mean, so we will await further details before judging this claim on its merits.)

On the other side of the gangway leading to the flight deck, ahead of door 1R, the access to the crew rest has been relocated, resulting in a new greatly expanded galley that grows from 5.5 to eight trolleys, with a corresponding increase in inserts and workspace.

The newly redesigned crew rest moves to the monument column immediately ahead of the front row of passengers, meaning that this aft-facing galley space drops from four trolleys to 3.5 — giving by our mathematics an overall increase in 2 trolleys.

Airbus is also taking the opportunity to introduce electro-dimmable windows from Gentex, suggesting that these windows are twice as fast as previous versions, 100 times darker and block 99.99% of visible light, as well as ultraviolet light.

Overall, the NPS generation of the A350s are going to make a substantial difference. Weight reduction and greater efficiency are strong positives, while more galley space is a very welcome addition.

The big question remains just how comfortable or otherwise the ultra-narrow seats and armrests will be, and the extent to which full-service airlines choose what will be the smallest economy class product in the sky.

Airbus suggests that seatmakers have done substantial work on this, but adding extra seats to comfortable Airbus widebodies has not been without risk in the past. We will withhold judgment until actually seeing the product up close.

"Russia will try to build its own jets to replace Boeing, Airbus - Fortune","Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDkvMjkvcnVzc2lhLWJ1aWxkLXBsYW5lcy1yb3N0ZWMtdWFjLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtdWtyYWluZS1zYW5jdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russian airlines have struggled in recent months to keep planes in the air, as sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stop them from getting needed parts for their Western Boeing and Airbus jets.

With the invasion dragging into its seventh month, Russia has a new solution: to try building more of its own planes to replace foreign jets that fall into disrepair.

State-owned manufacturing firm Rostec aims to build 1,000 planes locally by 2030, reports Reuters, in a bid to replace foreign jets. “Boeing and Airbus planes will never be delivered to Russia,” a Rostec spokesperson told Reuters.

Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in March, Boeing and Airbus said they would end their service centers and stop supplying components to the country. Russian airlines have tried to keep jets in the air by cannibalizing other planes for parts.

But eventually that supply of Airbus and Boeing parts will run out. “Foreign aircraft will eventually drop out of the fleet,” said a Rostec spokesperson to Reuters. “This process is irreversible.”

Local alternatives

Rostec was founded in 2007, and encompasses about 480 companies tied to defense. The holding company includes United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), Russia’s major aircraft manufacturer, responsible for planes like the civilian airliner Superjet 100 and the MiG fighter jet.

Earlier this month, Aeroflot, the Russian flag carrier, agreed to buy over 300 Russian-made planes to be delivered between 2023 and 2030. The order includes 210 MC-21 jets, a single-aisle jet meant to compete with the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380.

Western sanctions on Russia imposed after the Ukraine invasion have pushed back the rollout of the MC-21, as UAC tries to replace Western-sourced parts with locally manufactured alternatives.

For now, it appears that Russia wants to produce the vast majority of parts domestically, and not source parts even from non-Western countries like China.

In March, a Russian aviation official said that Chinese suppliers were refusing to sell parts to Russia for fear of coming under Western sanctions. (Russia later fired him.) Then, in June, China’s ambassador to Russia told TASS, the state-owned news agency, that Chinese suppliers were “ready to supply components” to Russian airlines.

Grounded

A lack of spare parts is not the only way sanctions have battered the Russian airline industry.

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union ordered jet leasing companies to cancel their contracts with Russian airlines by the end of March. About 515 planes were in service in Russia at the time, making up half of the Russian civilian fleet and worth about $10 billion.

Russian airlines like Aeroflot canceled international flights to prevent planes from being seized by their foreign owners. Moscow then granted airworthiness certificates to foreign-owned planes, allowing them to keep flying despite the legal uncertainty.

The Russian government and local airlines have offered to buy leased planes from their foreign owners. But leasing companies have largely given up on ever getting their planes back, writing them off as a loss.

Russian airlines are now starting to fly internationally again to destinations like Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Thailand. Tickets for flights out of Russia have shot up in price in the wake of the country’s partial mobilization.

Other countries are trying to break the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) is close to registering its domestic plane, the single-aisle plane C919. Western competitors are looking closely at COMAC, with Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury telling French radio that he took the Chinese company “very seriously.” But progress is slow, with COMAC only delivering one plane so far this year."

There’s nothing quite like keeping a memento of the one you loved, and if the one in question is the Airbus A380, you’re in luck.

The aircraft manufacturer has announced a sale of more than 500 items from one of its dearly departed big birds. The MSN13 was first flown by Emirates in 2008, was retired during the pandemic and scrapped in October 2021.

The pieces – mostly from the cabin – have been divided into 380 lots, and will be sold over three days, from 13-15 October. The auction will take place in Toulouse, though online bids are also allowed.

All proceeds will go to the Airbus Foundation and the AIRitage association, who have pledged the auction proceeds to humanitarian and heritage missions by the former and latter respectively.

Looking for something to remember her by? Lots include all the usuals, from seatbelts to lamps, plus windows, rows of seats, a staircase, and even a bar. There are Emirates-specific details too, like the illuminated emergency exit signs in English and Arabic.

For full-on avgeeks there are items such as baby bassinets, flashlights and latches to hold galley trolleys in place.

And if regular airplane fittings are not quite chic enough for you, there’s an arty option too.

This is a major step toward the co-creation of a functioning urban air mobility ecosystem in the region.

With this agreement, the partners will explore and define launch scenarios for air mobility operations, notably in Ecuador, Chile and Peru. This includes joint activities to develop UAM operations over the continent, as well as ways to target first use cases and pilot cities and regions. This partnership is an expansion of the manufacturer’s strong relationship with Ecocopter, who operates a fleet primarily comprised of Airbus helicopters for aerial work missions in a variety of industrial sectors.

Marcelo Rajchman, Ecocopter’s Corporate CEO, said: “With already 20 years of experience operating helicopters and 5 years operating drones, this partnership is a natural step for us. We seek to be a relevant player in the UAM ecosystem and the projects we will develop together with Airbus will bring us closer to this goal.”

Balkiz Sarihan, Airbus’ Head of Partnerships & Strategy Execution for UAM, added: “ We are excited to extend our long standing relationship with Ecocopter. Together we are taking concrete steps in the co-creation of the UAM ecosystem and our decarbonisation roadmap. This partnership leverages Airbus’ expertise in innovative vertical flight technologies, and Ecocopter’s extensive operational history and innovative culture.”

Established in 2003, Ecocopter is a reference in highly complex aerial work missions in South America. Its fleet of Airbus helicopters, consisting of 16 H125s, two H135s, and three H145s, is characterised by their high versatility and perform missions ranging from offshore transport, mining support, medical evacuation, firefighting, and almost the entire range of aerial work missions.

In September 2021, Airbus unveiled its eVTOL prototype CityAirbus NextGen, to explore advanced air mobility technologies and bring urban air mobility services to life. With an operational range of 80 km and a cruise speed of 120 km/h, it has been developed to be suited for a range of deployments in urban areas and beyond. The Company just announced the construction of a dedicated centre to test the aircraft’s systems in the lead up to its maiden flight. Airbus is also working closely with industrial and institutional partners to lead the development of urban air mobility ecosystems, as recently announced with ITA Airways in Italy, or through the launch of the Air Mobility Initiative in Germany.

Exploring virtual reality's future in air travel - Airbus,"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA5LWV4cGxvcmluZy12aXJ0dWFsLXJlYWxpdHlzLWZ1dHVyZS1pbi1haXItdHJhdmVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine a future airline in-flight experience where travellers can enter a virtual environment via the Metaverse without leaving their seats…visiting a relaxing town square with the soothing sounds of fountains and birds, exploring a nature trail, or even meeting the avatar of a fellow passenger on a park bench.

These were among the ideas submitted by participants in the 2022 HeroX/Airbus Metaverse Challenge, which attracted more than 60 submissions from individuals, teams and companies. Initiated by Tugrul Yildirim,Transformation leader at Technology and Engineering, this challenge was posted on the HeroX crowdsourcing platform – generating more than 16,800 views and 450-plus followers.

A total prize pool of $30,000 awarded to five winners



The submissions were assessed by 14 employees from across the Airbus Commercial Aircraft business, with the ideas judged in terms of user experience, creativity and novelty, as well as ease of implementation. Five winners were chosen to share a total prize pool of $30,000.

“Enhancing the passenger experience has always been a priority at Airbus, using innovation to improve the in-flight environment,” Yildirim explained. “We’re already at the cutting-edge in applying disruptive multimedia technologies – including studying how virtual reality can be applied. The HeroX/Airbus Challenge was created to see how others could envision the evolution of air travel via the Metaverse.”

The top submission: Capgemini’s Airbus “town square”



The winning entry was from Capgemini, an international information technology services company that proposed the virtual Airbus town square to win the top prize of $10,000. This environment would come alive after take-off, serving as a hub for an almost unlimited number of experiences in sights and sounds.

With the passenger logging in via tablets, smartphones and virtual reality headsets, the Airbus town square would be personalised for specifics of the trip (flight destination, and time zone changes to reduce jetlag, as examples) along with such traveller specifics as age, entertainment preferences and dietary restrictions. The hub also could serve as a platform for services – from in-flight shopping and the ordering of meals to booking hotels, car rentals and other post-flight services.

NFTs and a multiplayer VR environment



The HeroX/Airbus Challenge’s four other winners were awarded $5,000 each, and included a proposal by Silicon Harlem for an Ethereum-based project where users can purchase Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that “bloom"" into applications to book, experience and enjoy travel across artificial reality, virtual reality and the Metaverse. Based in New York, this company’s goal is to transform the city’s Harlem neighbourhood and other urban markets into technology and innovation hubs that fully engage in the digital economy.

Imersifi, a UK-based immersive technology company specialising in creating virtual and augmented reality applications, was another of the winners, proposing a multiplayer virtual reality environment to keep passengers entertained while flying. It would allow them to socialise with others from their seats (including taking 3D “walkarounds” together), while offering shopping and zones for gaming and relaxing.

Innovative proposals from individuals



One of the two winning proposals from individuals was the submission by H. Dhaliwal of Canada, with a virtual “sky lounge” application that would enable passengers to leave virtual “mementos'' in the sky, view outside of the airplane from any seat, as well as order food and drinks to be served in real life by flight attendants. The other individual winner was Brandon EnWezoh of the U.S., with a metaverse super-app for passengers with flight-related stress, discomfort or boredom – offering an interactive 360-degree virtual reality environment composed of photo-realistic 3D visuals and incorporating real-time user/flight data.

“The HeroX/Airbus Challenge gave us an excellent view on how the public and companies are beginning to imagine the Metaverse’s role in future air travel,” concluded Yildirim. “We were very pleased with the variety and originality of the ideas that were submitted and we warmly thank all the participants for their contributions!”"
Safety Innovation #3: Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) - Airbus,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA5LXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTMtdGVycmFpbi1hd2FyZW5lc3Mtd2FybmluZy1zeXN0ZW0tdGF3c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a fact, our industry has achieved huge improvements in safety since the 1950s, and technology has made a significant contribution in ensuring that the safety records of the whole aviation industry have very significantly improved.

In this series, we revisit some of the innovations that have provided a significant step change in improving the safety of our products. In this article, we will highlight the Terrain Awareness and Warning System.

In the early years of commercial aviation one of the three main categories of serious commercial aviation accidents involved aircraft unintentionally flown into terrain. These were properly functioning aircraft, under the control of a fully certificated and qualified crew.

Solutions were sought to help eradicate this type of accident, which are referred to as Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A breakthrough occurred in the 1970s when Don Bateman of Honeywell developed the Ground Proximity Warning System – a cockpit device that automatically warned pilots if their aircraft were dangerously approaching the ground or water. “This system used sensors which provide such data as the airplane’s vertical descent speed, height and altitude, to calculate the potential risk of CFIT and alerting the pilot by means of sound and visual signals in real time, operating in a reactive mode,"" says David Carlu, head of TAWS at Airbus.

It is the enhanced version of this system called TAWS that is in use today. “Technological improvements make the modern TAWS predictive – instead of just being reactive – by combining real-time data from the aircraft, along with satellite positioning information, as well as an extensive database of terrain and human-made obstacles,” he says.

This system was made mandatory by the world’s aviation authorities in the 1990s and the technology has made a big difference in flight safety. Its introduction, along with other technologies (including “glass cockpits” with digital electronic flight instrument displays, more capable flight management systems, along with navigation and air traffic control improvements), appropriate procedures and training have helped reduce the CFIT fatal accident rate by 86%.

In the helicopter sector, the evolution has been quite similar. The improvements are even more noticeable in their application on helicopters, considering the specific features and missions of these versatile machines. Whether it is to fly workers to an oil rig, carry heavy loads to remote mountainous areas or rescue people involved in an automobile accident, helicopters often fly at low altitudes – sometimes in hostile environments and in adverse weather conditions – which can hide dangers along the flight path. For these reasons, CFIT was a common type of accident.

The introduction of HTAWS (with the “H” signifying the system’s adaption for helicopters) marked a huge step in terms of safety improvement. Benefitting from the growing power of onboard computing – and combined with different functionalities such as satellite positioning, radio altimeters and a digitized terrain map – the HTAWS contributes to flight awareness while airborne, and alerts the crew of an imminent danger by way of an aural warning. It displays a synthetic view of natural or artificial obstacles on the cockpit’s multifunction displays, enabling crews to safely perform their missions.

Soon, HTAWS will be enhanced with the introduction of additional innovations. For instance, the artificial obstacle database and the remote natural locations database will be more accurate as they are updated. Research projects developed within Airbus also will raise the ability to offer customers their own tailored databases.

Another significant step towards safer operations for helicopters will be made by installing active sensors, such as wire detection (because difficult-to-see wires are a common danger), and eventually merging the best of active sensors and passive database technologies.

With the implementation of TAWS, the aircraft trajectory and possible conflicts with the terrain are indicated for the crew. The colour code indicates the distance to the ground: green means “sufficient,” yellow and red show danger."

French Navy takes delivery of first H160 for search and rescue missions - Airbus,"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wOS1mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1maXJzdC1oMTYwLWZvci1zZWFyY2gtYW5kLXJlc2N1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, The French Navy has taken delivery of the first of six H160s that will perform search and rescue (SAR) missions. The aircraft is part of the interim fleet that will be delivered by the partnership formed between Airbus Helicopters, Babcock, and Safran Helicopter Engines.



“The delivery of the first H160 to a military customer is a major milestone for the H160 programme”, said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “This is the first public service version of the H160 to be delivered worldwide. Furthermore, the delivery takes place soon after two H160s entered into service this summer, in Brazil for the private and business aviation segment and in Japan for news gathering missions”, he added. “With this H160 we will strengthen our partnership with the French Navy, delivering the right helicopter for its critical search and rescue missions. Together with our partners, we will also ensure that the H160 is ready when needed”.



In 2020 the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) signed a contract with Airbus Helicopters, Babcock, and Safran for the delivery of four H160s in a search and rescue (SAR) configuration. In 2021, the DGA confirmed an option for two more H160s. The first H160 for the French Navy was delivered to Babcock by Airbus Helicopters in May 2022. It has since then been modified into a light military configuration by Babcock. The modular cabin was also adapted for SAR operations and a Safran Euroflir 410 electro optical system was integrated.



The H160 will gradually start operating from the Lanveoc-Poulmic naval air station (Brittany), Cherbourg airport (Normandy), and the naval air station in Hyères (Provence). The interim fleet of H160s will ensure critical search and rescue missions while awaiting the delivery of the H160M Guépard. In the frame of the French Joint Light Helicopter (Hélicoptère Interarmées Léger: HIL) programme, 169 H160M Guépards are foreseen to replace five types of helicopters in service with the French armed forces. The French Navy’s operational feedback with these H160s will benefit the design of the military version of the aircraft and its associated support system.



Babcock, in partnership with Airbus Helicopters and Safran Helicopters Engines, will ensure the highest level of availability for the French Navy and the continuity of SAR operations on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coasts. Built by Airbus Helicopters, the H160 is certified for the use of night vision goggles, which are necessary for winching operations at night.



The H160, as a next generation medium twin engine aircraft, powered by Arrano engines, is modular by design in order to address missions ranging from offshore transportation, private and business aviation, emergency medical services, and public services.

Airbus to provide satellite communications for Armed Forces of Czech Republic and the Netherlands - Airbus,"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wOS1haXJidXMtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWFybWVkLWZvcmNlcy1vZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 9 September 2022 – Airbus has signed contracts with the Ministries of Defence of Czech Republic and the Netherlands to provide satellite communications for a 15 year period. The Armed Forces of Czech Republic and the Netherlands will utilise 2 and 3 channels respectively of the Airbus UHF (Ultra High Frequency) military communications hosted payload on-board the EUTELSAT 36D telecommunications satellite scheduled for launch in 2024.

With this new UHF payload, Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service to the armed forces, particularly those of European countries and NATO allies. As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource, this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed several firm orders for this capacity, well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Centre in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable up to 200 simultaneous communications over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, large parts of Asia, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF satcoms are used by the armed forces for operations on land, at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are therefore very useful for multinational and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and offers a lightweight, robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land, at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Airbus has unique experience in operating UHF milsatcom services. This new payload will enhance its portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite. Airbus is the only armed forces private satcom operator to cover the full spectrum of military (UHF, X, Ka Mil) and commercial (L, C/Ku, Ka) frequency bands and applications.

The EUTELSAT 36D satellite will be built by Airbus based on its Eurostar Neo platform. In addition to the UHF payload, it will also be equipped with 70 Ku-band transponders for TV broadcasting.

A range of proposals will be discussed and voted upon in order to drive improvements to safety, security, innovation, environmental protection and sustainability.

Next week marks the start of an important fortnight for the aviation sector. 27 September is the first day of the 41st International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montréal, Canada, a highly significant triennial event which brings together governments and other international organisations to discuss key global industry-wide considerations and ambitions.

ICAO plays a critical role in promoting safety, security and environmental protection in international civil aviation. It develops global policies, global standards and recommended practices, as well as defining ambitious goals such as Long-Term Aspirational Goals (LTAGs).

The commitments that will result from this next Assembly meeting – particularly concerning decarbonisation and other environmental matters – will define the transformation of our industry in the years to come.

ICAO develops policies, global standards and recommended practices, as well as defining ambitious Long-Term Aspirational Goals. The commitments that will result from this meeting – particularly concerning decarbonisation and other environmental matters – will define the transformation of our industry in the years to come.

Setting a plan for recovery and resilience – then making it happen

The world has changed significantly since the last ICAO Assembly took place in 2019, and this is reflected in the challenges that will be front of mind at the meeting.

Unsurprisingly, recovering from the COVID crisis is high on the agenda, with the aim to agree a set of actions that will strengthen resilience across the aviation industry.

However, this recovery will need to be sustainable and there is also a focus on “building back better”. This means actively working towards the decarbonisation of the aviation sector, which will require significant effort and investment. Related to this is the collective and global LTAG to reduce CO2 emissions from international civil aviation to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Progress on this goal has been a collaborative effort, with the strong support of industry partners and associations working together with ICAO to cement this LTAG as a true industry priority. We hope to see this gain further traction during the Assembly.

With topics of this magnitude, ambitious targets are not enough. We need industry- and states-wide consensus and then a practical and robust roadmap to achieve our objectives. ICAO’s role is to help create a “level playing field” where adequate solutions and capacity building programmes can be deployed across different regions of the globe.

Why ICAO – and the Assembly – is important for the aviation industry

The 193 member states have voting rights at the Assembly, while industry plays the role of an observer. But that does not mean that we are unable to contribute. Airbus participates in ICAO working groups, panels and around 180 meetings per year via our membership of industry associations like the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations (ICCAIA).

It is vital that Airbus, and other key stakeholders, maintain a strong presence in these associations in order to share expertise on and promote key issues such as decarbonisation, adapting to climate change, improving safety, and fostering innovation.

Progress is ongoing on technologies like Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), with all current Airbus aircraft certified to fly 50% SAF. We are working on securing 100% SAF capability by 2030. But there is still a long way to go: globally, less than 1% of operated flights use SAF. In order to roll out this technology more broadly our industry needs an appropriate framework and incentives. This is something that ICAO and its member states will be in a position to discuss and push with, for example, the ICAO Assistance, Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ICAO ACT-SAF) Platform.

Similarly, hydrogen technology has a clear role to play in our ambition to bring zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035. This too requires potential changes to regulations and certification standards, and also has implications for airports and air traffic management. A global consensus on this will need to be reached.

We will be watching with interest in the coming weeks to see which resolutions pass, and look forward to our continuing engagement with ICAO as the industry moves towards a safer, cleaner and more sustainable future.

The only way is up: Flight-testing the A321XLR gathers pace - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA5LXRoZS1vbmx5LXdheS1pcy11cC1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdGluZy10aGUtYTMyMXhsci1nYXRoZXJzLXBhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the coming weeks, following the recent maiden flight of A321XLR development aircraft MSN11000, two more prototypes, currently in advanced stages of manufacture, will join the certification flight-test campaign.

Gary O’Donnell, Head of the A321XLR programme provides an overview of what lies ahead in the run-up towards Type Certification: “Up until the end of this year, our focus is on completing the construction and then obtaining flight clearance for the remaining flight test aircraft. By the fourth quarter of this year, the three aircraft will be flying actively and we will have achieved a high level of production maturity.”

He points out that there will actually be four flight test aircraft in the A321XLR development programme. “The three -XLR new-builds are supported by an upgraded regular A321neo – MSN6839. This aircraft has already been fitted with several important new features designed for the -XLR.”

Once these development aircraft are all flying the global flight testing will be fully underway. Concurrent with the flight testing is the ongoing ground lab testing campaign to finalise the serial standard modifications [see our previous article about A321XLR lab test means activities].

“The completion of these activities and submission of all the final documents around the end of next year to the airworthiness authorities will allow us to validate and certify the complete aircraft. This will enable us to deliver to the airlines what they need on day one when the A321XLR enters service in 2024,” says O’Donnell.



Securing industrial maturity

“In parallel to entry into service, we have to build our full industrial system, including all jigs, all tools and processes, not only in every involved Airbus factory, but likewise in those of our extended industrial chain and at our suppliers around the world. We will also have to load them with the parts and materials. Overall securing the industrial system is a huge behind-the-scenes activity heavily involving especially our engineering, manufacturing and value chain teams,” notes O’Donnell.

“Our third pillar is to secure all the customer services documentation and ground support equipment, so the moment we hand over the aircraft to the customer it will be ready for use. And then – and only then – do we transition this project into ‘serial mode’ and hand it over to the bigger business.”



Flight testing scope overall rationale

Philippe Pupin, who leads the flight test engineering team for the A321XLR programme, and who was one of the crew members aboard the first flight of MSN11000 in June 2022, explains the rationale for the flight testing phase:

“In order to become a long-range aircraft, the A321XLR needs to carry more fuel, which means increasing the A321’s maximum take-off weight. In turn this requires uprated landing gear and braking systems. However, since we are keeping the engine thrust unchanged, we have made some aerodynamic changes to retain our desired take-off performance. This has driven the physical modifications to the high-lift system – the slats and flaps – as well as reprogramming of the flight control system, all of which needs to be flight-tested and certified.”

“In terms of flight hours of testing the -XLR programme stands somewhere in between a brand new aircraft and a derivative. So we have to ‘re-test’ virtually everything regarding aircraft design and flight physics,” he adds.

With the A321XLR, Airbus has also taken the opportunity to infuse some recent developments to the overall flight control system design – which was hitherto based on the original architecture for the A321 designed in the early 1990s. The aim is to enhance flight control design commonality across all programmes – and further fulfils Airbus’ unified Fly-By-Wire architecture implementation.

Testing the -XLR's new flight-physics features

Notable flight-physics-related changes on the -XLR (compared with today’s A321neo) include a simpler single-slotted inboard flap system (replacing the double-slotted inboard flap of the original A321’s wing); an electronically signalled “e-Rudder” (with related changes to the flight control computers); and uprated landing gear, wheels and brakes.

Caption: Closeup view showing the new inboard single-slotted flap of the A321XLR.



So as to gain an early head start for testing these features, several have been retrofitted into MSN6839 well before completion of the first new-build A321XLR – including the new inboard flap system. Having the latter means that MSN6839 is now aerodynamically equivalent to the -XLR once the landing gear is retracted. This has enabled it to perform ‘velocity minimum unstick’ (VMU) tests, the absolute minimum speed at which an aircraft can take off), for example. (VMU tests are determinants of the operational takeoff speeds used by airline pilots).

Functional testing is also needed to validate the operation of new non-flight-physics-related systems introduced on the -XLR. Two major ones include the new water & waste system as well as the new fuel system elements (pumps and control systems etc.) associated with the integral Rear-Centre-Tank which can hold up to 12,900 litres of additional fuel.



Flight-test assignments – FTV1 & FTV2

Of the three new-build A321XLR test aircraft, the first two – MSN11000 (known as ‘FTV1’) and MSN11058 (‘FTV2’) are equipped with the full suite of flight-test instrumentation (FTI) and engineer interactive stations.

Both FTV1 and FTV2 will feature a transferable water ballast system to ensure the change of CG during flight. Overall, they will focus on the aircraft’s technical systems, updated flight controls and handling and performance. The only major physical difference between these aircraft is their respective engine type: CFM LEAP-1As for FTV1 and P&W GTF engines for FTV2.



Jean-Philippe Cottet, head of Flight Tests says: “We are certifying the two engine types in parallel on the A321XLR in the same timescale. It's a first in our history, since in the recent past we have been certifying engine variants sequentially one after the other.”

However, for test scenarios where the engine-types are not themselves the focus, FTV1 and FTV2 can perform a similar scope of flight testing: “We can easily interchange between them. For example, for evaluating the A321XLR’s handling qualities we have more than 100 flights to perform, and only a few of these tests are specific to FTV1 or FTV2 – since the majority can be performed by either aircraft, ” he adds.

At the time of writing, with the flight test programme still in its early days following the first flight, FTV1 had already completed the following: flight-envelope opening; flight control laws clearance; rotation law evaluation and angle-of-attack (AOA) protection tuning; high speed performance flights, anemometry calibration, fuel and landing gear system ground testing and some autopilot tests.

New-generation high-capacity Flight-Test Instrumentation (FTI)

Cottet points out that the value of having prototypes is only fully realised by their capability to provide the best results and recorded data to the teams for analysis and certification: “We are using a new flight test instrumentation in these aircraft which is able to record approximately for over 20 hours. We need this capacity – as we have some missions that require us to record large amounts of data not only during flight, but also pre- and post-flight – ie. on the ground.”

Caption: MSN11000 features a new-generation of flight-test instrumentation.



“Our on board FTI suite can record and process as much as 80,000 lines of data,” he notes. “This is fed by more than 1,000 physical measurement transducers installed throughout the aircraft, and whose wiring inside the aircraft can be seen to converge towards the Flight Test Engineer console and the telemetry equipment.”



Passenger cabin elements and route proving - FTV3

The third new-build aircraft – MSN11080 (FTV3) – which is powered by CFM LEAP engines, is currently being fitted with a ‘lighter’ FTI installation since its duties will focus more on maturity testing of the passenger cabin interior elements and also route-proving for customers.

Pupin explains: “When you transform a medium to short range aircraft into a very long range aircraft, very special care needs to be taken regarding the cabin comfort, both in terms of thermal comfort over an 11 hour flight, and also in terms of the level of noise. We are therefore fitting an upgraded cabin into the -XLR which is closer to what is offered in our standard Long Range aircraft.”

As well as showcasing the -XLR's interior, FTV3’s duties will also focus on demonstrating the aircraft’s operation on the expected route scenarios for its customers, especially so-called ‘demanding’ ones to validate the aircraft’s operation at the extremities of take-off weights, range, runway constraints, ground temperatures and weather conditions etc..

“We need to demonstrate the aircraft from multiple types of runways which would be experienced by the pilots, and so we plan to invite our customers as early as possible to fly with us – as they did on the A330neo. I'm sure we will learn a lot, so this campaign will ensure we will deliver the product which we have promised to our customers,” concludes Cottet."
Airbus and HeliDax sign first HCare Classics support contract to cover fleet of 36 H120s - Airbus,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wOS1haXJidXMtYW5kLWhlbGlkYXgtc2lnbi1maXJzdC1oY2FyZS1jbGFzc2ljcy1zdXBwb3J0LWNvbnRyYWN0LXRv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, French helicopter operator HeliDax and Airbus Helicopters have signed the first-ever HCare Classics support contract to optimise the availability of HeliDax’s H120 fleet. HCare Classics is Airbus’ new support package entirely dedicated to meeting the support needs of the company’s out-of-production legacy helicopters.



An H120 operator since 2008, HeliDax relies on its fleet of 36 H120s to provide basic and advanced training to the French and Belgian armed forces and the French Gendarmerie. Since the beginning of this partnership with the French government 14 years ago, HeliDax has maintained an availability level of 100% and has accumulated 246,000 hours of H120 flight time, training multiple generations of helicopter pilots. This translates to as many as 22,000 flight hours per year.



HeliDax’s fleet is the largest in-service H120 fleet in the world today. With eight years remaining in the pilot training programme contract, HeliDax selected HCare Classics to benefit from the OEM’s guaranteed support performance.



“To continue guaranteeing our fleet and service availability until the end of our contract with the government in 2030, it is essential to have a strong commitment from our major partner, Airbus Helicopters, in terms of support and obsolescence monitoring,” says Christian Prigentt, director of HeliDax. “The HCare Classics contract secures our supply chain and replaces our acquisition of safety stocks, whose quantities are based on estimates only without taking into account future logistical supply chain risks. In this respect, and thanks to its service, which is paid per flight hour, this contract will contribute directly to our management of maintenance costs, until the end of our agreement with the French government.”



“HeliDax is a great example of the many customers who continue to operate legacy helicopters to perform essential missions, and we’re honored to extend our relationship with them via this support contract. Through HCare Classics, Airbus Helicopters secures the supply chain and ensures sufficient provision of spare parts, as well as other support options specifically tailored to meet the needs of these unique operators,” says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters. “One example of how we approach the supply chain is by parting out aircraft as a means to inject parts into the pool, thus adding an important lever for sustainable life-cycle management of our fleet.”

Today there are more than 2,000 legacy Airbus helicopters in service with approximately 750 operators around the world. These out-of-production aircraft include the H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle and account for 15% of the flight hours generated by the entire Airbus Helicopters fleet.



HCare Classics is a multi-service offering created to meet the customer’s operational needs. Customers choose the services they need, ranging from obsolescence monitoring and management to spare parts support and maintenance planning.



HeliDax is based within the French Army Aviation’s school in Dax, France and is a full subsidiary of DCI Group.

easyJet to upgrade its Airbus A320 family fleet with Descent Profile Optimisation and Continuous Descent Approach to ... - Airbus Aircraft,"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLTA5LWVhc3lqZXQtdG8tdXBncmFkZS1pdHMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtZmFtaWx5LWZsZWV0LXdpdGgtZGVzY2VudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 26 September 2022 – easyJet is to upgrade its A320 Family fleet with Airbus’ “Descent Profile Optimisation” (DPO) – a fuel-saving enhancement to the aircraft’s on-board Flight Management System (FMS) performance database and “Continuous Descent Approach” (CDA) to reduce noise impact on the ground. The European short-haul airline will become the biggest operator worldwide using these powerful combined solutions.

While our ultimate ambition is to achieve zero carbon emission flying, we must continue our focus on reducing the carbon emissions in our operation each and every day. That’s why this multi-million-pound investment is an important step in achieving a permanent reduction in the short-term which will see us operating the largest fleet of DPO and CDA enabled aircraft in the world. But one crucial element to reduce carbon emissions right now cannot be achieved by the industry alone, and so we are also calling on governments to introduce airspace modernisation right now, including finally implementing the Single European Sky

said Captain David Morgan, easyJet’s interim COO.

“We are very pleased that easyJet will equip its entire Airbus A320-family-fleet with these state-of-the-art technologies. Emission reduction in aviation is most successfully achieved as a team effort - aircraft manufacturers joining forces with airlines and air traffic management. By combining the use of DPO and CDA,easyJet will further reduce its fuel consumption while optimising the trajectory of all its flights,” said Wouter Van Wersch, Executive Vice President, Region and Sales Europe.

The DPO and CDA functions allow aircraft to descend from cruise altitude using only idle engine thrust. This reduces fuel consumption and associated CO2 and NOx (nitrogen oxide emissions) reductions as well as to noise. To further enhance fuel reduction and noise impact, DPO and CDA maximise the time spent at efficient cruise level -by not starting the descent too early and removing the ‘level-off’ stage at the bottom of the descent when the aircraft’s engines generate thrust to maintain level flight in dense air prior to final landing approach.

Following this upgrade, which will be in place by the end of 2023, easyJet’s entire fleet, of more than 300 Airbus A320-Family aircraft, will be equipped with DPO and additionally and CDA for compatible aircraft.

Optimisation of the aircraft’s flight trajectory is one of the key factors to further improve efficiency in cooperation with Air Traffic Control. By optimising the descent trajectories of its aircraft and reducing the fuel flow to the engines -arising from the lowest ‘idle’ thrust setting during the descent phase- thanks to the DPO and CDA functions, easyJet will save more than 98,000 kg of fuel per year per aircraft across its network in Europe. This will reduce CO2 emissions by over 311 tons per year per aircraft, or 88,600 tons of CO2 each year for the entire A320 Family fleet, representing a significant contribution to more sustainable flight operations.

DPO and CDA are just some of the several flight operations optimisation solutions offered by Airbus and its flight operations services subsidiary NAVBLUE. Together with improved Air Traffic Management, these fuel savings and emissions reductions solutions enable operators to start aviation decarbonisation now.

Qatar Airways just received a major blow from Airbus as the two continue to quarrel over paint issues on the carrier's A350.

European planemaker Airbus confirmed to Insider on Friday that it has canceled all of Qatar's orders for A350 aircraft. The outstanding orders included 19 widebody jets, with Airbus saying it believed Qatar no longer wanted to honor the contract after refusing to take delivery of two A350s in February.

While Airbus says Qatar was unwilling to receive the widebodies, the carrier claims Airbus outright canceled the order. However, Qatar had previously said it would refuse any future deliveries until Airbus provided a full root-cause analysis for the problems, which the planemaker told Insider it had.

Qatar said it did not have a statement available at this time when contacted by Insider.

Airbus also canceled Qatar's order for 50 A321neos in January, which CEO Akbar Al Baker called ""a matter of considerable regret and frustration."" In July, Qatar firmed up an order for 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets to help fill its narrowbody needs.

Airbus' decision to nix Qatar's remaining A350 orders comes as the two companies battle over the condition of the jet's paint — an issue that Al Baker says ""destroyed"" the carrier's relationship with Airbus.

In August 2021, Qatar grounded its A350 jets due to concerns over surface paint issues, which it and the nation's aviation regulator said posed a threat to the safety and airworthiness of the aircraft. As of June 2022, the carrier has grounded 23 A350s.

A spokesperson told Insider in January that ""the defects are not superficial, and one of the defects causes the aircraft's lightning protection system to be exposed and damaged.""

Qatar also pointed to potential moisture and ultraviolet exposure to the composite structure and cracking in the composite that could damage a ""high percentage of rivets on the aircraft fuselage.""

Several other carriers, like Etihad Airways and Delta Air Lines, have also noted degrading paint on their A350s, per Reuters, but none have made the same claims as Qatar nor say the damage is a safety threat.

Since Qatar raised concerns over the A350, Airbus and the carrier have been at a stalemate on how to resolve the issue. Airbus has repeatedly pushed back on Qatar, saying the damaged paint is simply ""cosmetic.""

""The attempt by this customer to misrepresent this specific topic as an airworthiness issue represents a threat to the international protocols on safety matters,"" the planemaker said in a December statement.

The European Aviation Safety Agency has backed Airbus by saying the paint does not impact airworthiness, per Bloomberg.

While Airbus has ""provided necessary guidance to its customers and operators for continuous operations,"" Qatar is still unhappy with the planemakers' response. As a result, Qatar sued Airbus in a London High Court and is seeking $618 million in damages.

The trial will occur in the UK next summer, but, in the meantime, the court told Airbus it could sell its undelivered A350s to other carriers, like Air India, Reuters reported.

""On a personal level I am friends with everyone but when it comes to an issue with my company, then it's a different story,"" Al Baker told a news conference in June according to Reuters. ""If things were settled, we would not be still waiting for a trial to happen next year.""

Airbus told Insider that the company is still open to a settlement with Qatar, with CEO Guillaume Faury telling Reuters in June that there was ""progress in the sense that we are communicating."""
"Brazil buys new Airbus helicopters for Air Force, Navy - Defense News","Thu, 22 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIyLzA5LzIyL2JyYXppbC1idXlzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZm9yLWFpci1mb3JjZS1uYXZ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Brazil’s military has purchased new helicopters from Airbus, according to a statement from the European defense company.

The deal includes 27 single-engine H125 helos meant to “boost the training capacity” of Brazil’s Air Force and Navy, the Friday statement said. The new aircraft will replace AS350 and Bell 206 helicopters currently in use by the two services.

“This joint procurement contract represents the realization of a project that will equip both the Brazilian Air Force and Navy with modern aircraft that will meet the needs of the Forces for the next 30 years,” Lt. Brig. Carlos de Almeida Baptista Junior, commander of the Air Force, said in the statement.

Airbus, which lists its “headquarters” in the Netherlands and its “main office” in France, said the H125s will feature a G500H TXi double glass cockpit as well as a vehicle and engine multifunction display. The helicopters will also be compatible with night vision goggles.

An Airbus spokesperson said it is company policy to not comment on the purchase price.

Brazil’s military currently operates more than 150 Airbus helicopters from eight different bases around the country, according to the company, and its fleet ranges “from the light single engine Ecureuil family to the multi-purpose heavy H225M helicopter.”

The H125 helicopter has logged 37 million flight hours, and there are more than 5,300 in operation globally.

With its twin HOTBIRD 13G, both satellites will broadcast over 1,000 television channels across Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East

Toulouse, 13 September 2022 – The first of Airbus’ next generation geostationary Eurostar Neo satellites is ready to be shipped to Cape Canaveral for launch preparations.

HOTBIRD 13F will inaugurate the Eurostar Neo satellite era, while still benefiting from Airbus' strong heritage of 80 Eurostar family satellites already launched. It will be positioned at 13 degrees east along with its twin satellite, HOTBIRD 13G, also built by Airbus and being launched later this year.

The Eurostar Neo pair feature increased payload capacity, more efficient power and thermal control systems than previous generation and will replace three Eutelsat satellites currently in orbit at this location.

Francois Gaullier, Head of Telecommunications & Navigation Systems at Airbus said: “Eutelsat has been a valued partner for many Airbus satellite firsts from pioneering the previous Eurostar E3000 generation, to electric orbit raising or the first fully flexible payload – and now with our first Eurostar Neos. This new platform has been developed thanks to the support of ESA, showing the power of partnerships between industry, agencies and commercial players in Europe.”

Airbus aims to join up the data dots across its organization using Splunk - diginomica,"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGlnaW5vbWljYS5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtam9pbi1kYXRhLWRvdHMtYWNyb3NzLWl0cy1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24tdXNpbmctc3BsdW5r0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9kaWdpbm9taWNhLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYWltcy1qb2luLWRhdGEtZG90cy1hY3Jvc3MtaXRzLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi11c2luZy1zcGx1bms_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Image by Orna Wachman from Pixabay )

Airbus, the European aerospace designer and manufacturer, is undergoing a digital transformation that is seeing it move its existing on-premise workloads to the public cloud and create an enterprise-wide data platform that is built on Splunk. The aim is to improve customer experience, drive more innovation, enable quicker decision making and reduce costs - although cultural and organizational change is front of mind for the company too.

Chris Taylor, who was VP of Airbus’ Digital Accelerator (who now works at ServiceNow), spoke at a Splunk event where he said that the company’s business objectives were quite simple: faster time to market, lower cost, and the ability to adapt to new customer opportunities. However, the priority has been doing this on a global basis. The Digital Accelerator programme has been running for approximately three and a half years.

Airbus is fairly mature in its use of digital collaboration tools, according to Taylor, where all of these run in one of the major cloud provider’s environments. However, now the priority is moving the company’s core on-premise systems to the public cloud too. Taylor explained;

The thing about cloud is you can build it for one application or two applications, but building it for a global enterprise is quite a different challenge when you want to consume it in a democratized way. And so Airbus has been investing in that for the last two and a half to three years. We're now starting to pull more and more applications and workloads from on premise into the public cloud. It is a challenge. The focus was originally customer experience and scaling innovation, but now we're moving existing workloads that are on premise and moving them to the public cloud for cost saving opportunities.

A central part of this transformation is Airbus’ data strategy, which has a central purpose of creating value for customers, employees and suppliers - enabling them to make faster, better decisions to drive business performance. Taylor said:

That is the business objective. And so to do that at the scale of Airbus,you typically need a large global enterprise platform that can be self-service, that enables democratization of the centre of truth of data, and that people can consume. Because the value is not created by the platform, the value is created by people making faster, better decisions. We wanted to have a single enterprise data fusion platform, because the value is accelerated and magnified when you integrate the data together. You break the data silos - and by breaking the data silos you help to break the cultural and organizational silos that exist. And therefore, the value of digital transformation is about joining the dots across the organization. And so Splunk enables us to join the dots.

Taylor said that companies typically select Splunk for singular use cases, such as IT operations, or cybersecurity. However, at Airbus, Splunk is being used as one platform to deliver many segments of ‘business value. He added:

We chose IT operations. We've analysed business processes. We use it for running and helping IT as a business, but we also use it for cybersecurity. But not just security operations, but for compliance, for data driven decision making, and freeing the data out for the organization to use rather than the silos. Splunk is one of our key enterprise tools. And we've got several that enable our products and services to demonstrate adoption and value of the performance of those products. We also use it for a multitude of different topics - managing waste in an IT environment, running IT as a business. That’s a key topic, but obviously even more of a key topic in an environment such as COVID-19 and aircraft manufacturing. Splunk enables our teams to look at waste - what about our assets? Where are stranded assets? Where are underutilized assets? It really is used for many, many use cases. And very early on we realized that actually one platform with the data integrated can solve for many use cases and products - and help those products run as a business, manage value, manage costs, manage waste.

Security risks

Taylor explained that data had previously existed in silos at Airbus, which is suboptimal for delivering value. But, he added, people also do like to maintain this as a status quo, because silos mean that they can maintain control and manage their data. The key, Taylor said, is to open their minds to the fact that data is more valuable if it is shared and integrated with other data across the organization.

A key enabler for bringing people on board has been using cybersecurity as a showcase. Taylor said:

Cybersecurity is a business risk managed by collaboration across the enterprise. I cannot think of any cyber risk that is purely dependent on one control only. It's not the case, it doesn't exist. And so it's actually about the combination of controls. It's actually about teams collaborating together, prioritizing and analyzing the data so that you get control management and risk management. And so, cybersecurity is a great example where joining the dots across the organization, breaking down the silos and having a single version of the data referential, where you can see your cybersecurity environment, is incredibly important.

This issue became even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where people’s working habits changed. Taylor added:

We saw at Airbus a change in people’s behaviour due to COVID. People worked from home, but they also consumed services and data, and the data risk changed. And so we analyzed around 10 key dimensions in Splunk, and we used it to identify and measure the change in risk in our environment. We then use that very same data to reprioritize our investments and put in place new cybersecurity controls due to COVID, to manage that changing cyber risk. And this is really about devices spending a long time working from home. And then what we did was we used that to make investments about how we manage the risk of re-onboarding those devices. All of that was identified, prioritized, and measured the outcome and the benefits of, with Splunk.

Don’t underestimate culture change

Airbus is still part way through its journey to the cloud and the development of its data capabilities. But front of mind for Taylor and his team is bringing stakeholders on board - where cultural change is central to the strategy. He said that it’s important to identify people that are ‘data curious’ and to then reduce their barriers to access - whether that be providing training, or actual access to the data. He said:

Once you remove those barriers, then you start to get the volume, and then you start to get the tool adoption.

Getting this culture change piece right will be key to Airbus’ success in the future. Taylor added:"

The Military & Aerospace Electronics take:

19 September 2022 - Through this agreement, Airbus and Hiratagakuen will tackle crucial aspects required to launch a commercial transportation service with CityAirbus NextGen. As a major first step, the partners’ joint project to organise a simulation of ideal routes, concepts of operations and necessary equipment for safe eVTOL flights in the Kansai region, has been selected by the Osaka prefecture, with a demonstration flight scheduled for later this year.

With the aim to implement air mobility services beyond urban environments, the joint work of Airbus and Hiratagakuen will support the development of advanced air mobility solutions with CityAirbus NextGen, for use cases ranging from air medical services to commercial air transport and ecotourism in a variety of operational contexts. To reach this objective, and with the support of local stakeholders, Airbus and Hiratagakuen will use an H135 helicopter to test advanced navigation and communication technologies for safe operations of eVTOLs in urban environments, while simulating CityAirbus NextGen’s flight configuration.

Balkiz Sarihan, Head of UAM Strategy Execution and Partnerships at Airbus, said: “We are honoured to further our long standing collaboration with Hiratagakuen by working on this exciting journey towards zero emission flights. Their expertise in commercial air transport and air medical services operations makes them an ideal partner for defining the operational framework for advanced air mobility with CityAirbus NextGen in Japan”.

Forests will expand again - Airbus,"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA5LWZvcmVzdHMtd2lsbC1leHBhbmQtYWdhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Satellite imagery is vital when it comes to saving our Planet’s forests and wildlife - says Wendy Carrara, Senior Manager for Digital Services at Airbus Defence and Space.

Wendy, the EU Council recently agreed on new rules to drive down deforestation and forest degradation. What is Airbus doing to help save our planet’s vegetation?

The new EU regulation is the first of its kind to take such a global approach. I’m really looking forward to the final text being voted on by Parliament this autumn. All in all, for the regulation to have a sustainable impact, satellite imagery is going to be essential. And this is where we at Airbus come in: understanding the vegetation’s lifecycle using satellite images is something we have been working on and delivering for more than 20 years. Each crop or tree has its own characteristics that can be analyzed and recognised from space: through free and open data from Airbus-built Copernicus Earth Observation satellites or our own Pléiades Neo satellite constellation that offers very high resolution imagery of up to 30cm. More particularly when it comes to forests, our Starling solution provides industry-wide services to many stakeholders so that those operating in our rainforests can do so sustainably.

And how does that work exactly?

Starling combines more than half a million up-to-date satellite images with powerful machine learning analytics to monitor deforestation. Additional data such as boundary lines and protected areas are also used together with supply chain data provided by our users for various commodities such as palm oil, cocoa, pulp and paper.Thanks to all this data and powerful automated analyses developed by our Airbus experts, Starling sheds light on and helps understand the dynamics of forest cover change and the impact of human activities to better protect vital areas like rainforests. Users can therefore achieve their deforestation commitments when it comes to their supply chain . The use of Starling drives both awareness and local action, enhancing transparency and by doing so helps transform the way resources are produced or harvested. Our customers can then better measure their impact, communicate on their results and overall progress.

See infographics below to learn how Starling works

How much forest has Starling already saved?

It has already saved thousands of hectares of forest - for example in Africa or in South-East Asia. Food and beverage company Nestlé, for instance, has been using Starling since 2019 to track its palm oil supply chain. In 2021, Ferrero monitored 1,225 million hectares of forest, ensuring its palm oil supply chain was 99% deforestation free (for more details, click here). It’s not just palm oil, it’s also other commodities Starling supports, such as cocoa, pulp, paper and more.

What else?

Recently, we signed an agreement with NGO Fairtrade to develop a pilot on deforestation and environmental vulnerability together with smallholder farmers in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Typical actions here will result in further awareness raising around deforestation and forest degradation for further sustainable forest management practices linked to Cocoa (for more information, click here).

That sounds very promising. Where will deforestation stand in a decade from now?

I am optimistic that a lot can be achieved in the coming ten years. We have all the tools to do so and an unprecedented political will to move forward. It’s quite unique and exciting to have this double momentum. Humanity will be able to produce the necessary commodities for agro-food and manage deforestation caused by all sorts of other industrial activities in a sustainable fashion. More importantly, tools such as Starling can further support replanting activities and be a cornerstone for sustainable forest management globally. There are going to be areas where forests are gaining ground and expanding again. As a result, we might be lucky enough to even spot some species of birds or frogs again that we all thought were on the verge of disappearing. I am very much aware that we still have a long way to go, but we have already demonstrated positive results and the use of satellite imagery will make all this possible and at scale."
US private jet market ‘to continue record growth’: Airbus - Corporate Jet Investor,"Mon, 05 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnBvcmF0ZWpldGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VzLXByaXZhdGUtamV0LW1hcmtldC10by1jb250aW51ZS1yZWNvcmQtZ3Jvd3RoLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US private jet market ‘to continue record growth’: Airbus

news by CJI Expert September 5, 2022 Print this page

The US private jet market, currently numbering 14,632 aircraft or 62.5% of the world’s fleet, will continue record growth building on pre-Covid flight activity, according to research from Airbus.

Sean McGeough, vice president and head of Airbus Corporate Jets North America, said: “The US business aviation sector is the biggest in the world, and it is growing, in the first six months of 2022, the number of business aviation departures in the US was 15.2% higher than during the same period in 2019.”

McGeough told Corporate Jet Investor (CJI): “Many flight departments and fractional ownership card holders I have spoken to have already exceeded their flight allocation for the year. You will continue to see year-over-year growth in private jet travel never seen before.”

McGeough attributed this increase in demand to the lifestyle changes arising from the global pandemic: “People want to meet face-to-face and thus there was a drastic increase in the number of passengers flying privately for the first time,” he told CJI, “Customers re-evaluated values brought by business aviation, such as privacy, sanitary benefits to avoid crowded airports [and] freedom of schedule.” Also the big reduction in scheduled commercial flights – particularly among regional carriers – had also boosted the number of new entrants for private jet aviation.

Heavy or long-range jets accounted for 37.5% of the US fleet, with light jets totalling 36.5%, midsize 20.5% and very light jets at 5.5%.

“Because of the huge size of the US and its importance on the global stage, over one-third of private jets registered in the country are categorised as heavy or ultra-long range, which is where we focus,” said McGeough.

The Airbus research also revealed the three states with the largest private jet fleets are Texas, Florida and California with 1,651, 1,619 and 1,431 private jets respectively. Heavy jets accounted for 33.9%, 44.2% and 50.6% of each state’s fleet.

Houston was named as the US city with the largest private jet fleet of 329 aircraft. That was followed by Dallas with 327 jets, Fort Lauderdale with 307, Van Nuys with 273 and Miami with 229 private jets.

Meanwhile, McGeough told CJI that most of the ultra-long range (ULR) aircraft are operated within the US or to South America or Europe, flying for only a small part of the 17 hours duration. “Data shows in 2019 that only 1.4% of all the ULR aircraft based in the US fly further than 5,500 nautical miles,” he said. “This is another reason why the ACJ Two Twenty has such a strong value proposition at 5,650 nm intercontinental range, whereas other aircraft have range capacities that are well underutilised.

It mentioned Airbus Corporate Jets and its ACJ TwoTwenty. Seems that Airbus is pitching a corporate version of its A220—a design originated by Bombardier as the CS100, part of its CSeries of airliners. After a sequence of events triggered by Boeing’s claim that Bombardier was dumping the CSeries at bargain-basement prices, Airbus took over the program, rebranding the single-aisle, 100-seat CS100 as the A220-100.

Although Airbus launched the ACJ TwoTwenty in 2020, a push is now in gear to sell these plush 18-seat, five-zone, 5,650-nautical-mile converted airliners as the leaders in what the company calls “The Xtra Large Bizjet” segment. Although there have been predecessors with similar ambitions—Embraer’s Lineage 1000 and Boeing’s BBJ come to mind—Airbus has been doing its research and feels confident there’s a market for the ACJ TwoTwenty (please don’t say “A220”; that’s the airliner version) in the United States. Makes sense, because everyone knows that’s the biggest market for corporate jets—or any other kind of aircraft, for that matter.

Airbus figured that out by doing some digging and coming up with the number of heavy business jets, and their lesser cousins, based around the United States. It published an interesting chart that I’ll share with you, which shows the states with the most private jets.

Blow for Boeing as Airbus lands major plane order from China - RFI English,"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyMDkyMy1ibG93LWZvci1ib2VpbmctYXMtYWlyYnVzLWxhbmRzLW1ham9yLXBsYW5lLW9yZGVyLWZyb20tY2hpbmEteGlhbWVuLWFpcmxpbmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

China's Xiamen Airlines has ordered 40 new aircraft from Airbus, becoming the latest Chinese carrier to favour the European manufacturer over US rival Boeing.

Xiamen Airlines is ""switching to Airbus for its fleet growth, making the airline the newest Airbus customer,"" the manufacturer said in a statement on Thursday.

Until now the airline, part of the China Southern group, has exclusively flown Boeing aircraft.

Airbus said that Xiamen Airlines ""placed a firm order"" for 40 A320neo family aircraft.

At list prices, the order would be worth more $4 billion, but airlines usually negotiate considerable discounts when ordering multiple aircraft.

International tensions

The order comes nearly three months after four Chinese airlines – Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Shenzhen Airlines – placed a bumper order for 292 Airbus planes, worth an estimated $37 billion.

While weakened by the pandemic, airlines around the world are preparing for an expected doubling of air travel in the next two decades.

In July, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said that geopolitical tensions between the United States and China ""tipped the balance"" in Beijing's decision to start favouring Airbus over Boeing.

Yet while relations between the EU and Beiing also remain strained as well, tit-for-tat sanctions over human rights issues do not yet include major business deals.

Airbus A350 Getting Dimmable Windows - One Mile at a Time,"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWRpbW1hYmxlLXdpbmRvd3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At CES 2020, Airbus initially revealed that it planned to introduce dimmable windows in its aircraft cabins, including on the Airbus A350. This is expected to be introduced on planes as of this year (2022), though it’s interesting to note that at least one airline customer isn’t interested in this technology.

Airbus will start offering dimmable windows

Airbus intends to start delivering Airbus A350s with a dimmable window feature in the near future. This was recently confirmed, though the launch customer for this new feature hasn’t yet been revealed.

This is part of an overall change to the aircraft manufacturer’s signature Airspace cabin design, and it will bring the Airbus A350 in line with the Boeing 787 in this regard, as the latter plane has long (controversially) offered dimmable windows.

The new window shade technology is designed by Gentex Corporation, which is a supplier of electronically dimmable windows for the aerospace industry. With these latest generation electrochromic windows, passengers will no longer have to manually push the window shade up or down, but rather can adjust their window shade setting by the push of a button.

Gentex states that this new technology will allow passengers to selectively darken the windows while still viewing scenery outside. These dimmers will eliminate the need for window shades, and also incorporate a heat control solution that blocks infra-red energy from entering the cabin from outside, lessening the dependence on air conditioning systems.

These latest generation windows will feature high-speed transition between clear and dark, and will also offer an ultra-dark low-end transmission. Compared to previous designs, the latest windows will darken twice as fast and become 100 times darker, eliminating 99.999% of visible light.

Airbus A350s will soon get dimmable windows

Lufthansa not interested in dimmable windows

It’s interesting to note that while the first Airbus jet with dimmable windows is expected to enter service in the coming months, Lufthansa reportedly isn’t interested in this feature. The airline has quite a few Airbus A350s on order, and has opted not to install dimmable windows on these planes.

As reported by aeroTELEGRAPH, a Lufthansa spokesperson says that this isn’t about cost savings, but rather is about the passenger experience, and the general downsides of this window technology.

There’s a lot to look forward to with Lufthansa’s upcoming Airbus A350s, as the ones delivered starting in 2023 are expected to feature Lufthansa’s new business class, and will also feature a new first class product.

Lufthansa won’t have dimmable windows on its A350s

My issue with Boeing 787 dimmable windows

Many people like the window shades on the 787 and find them to be cool, though personally I strongly dislike them (this is actually one of the reasons I prefer the A350 to the 787):

Many times the crew will just “lock” the window setting on dark for the entire flight, meaning there’s no way you can look outside

Even when in the darkest mode, I find that it’s still somewhat bright, and worst of all if you’re on the same side of the plane as the sun, it can get hot

The dimming happens slowly, which sometimes makes it tough to figure out if you’re controlling the window shades correctly or not

All Boeing 787s feature dimmable windows

On the plus side, it seems that the dimmable window technology from Airbus addresses some of my concerns — the dimming will happen much more quickly than on the 787, and at the max setting, the dimming will be much darker.

However, it doesn’t address my biggest concern, which is airline crews trying to dictate window shade settings. Personally I love sitting in a window seat for the view, but unfortunately some airline crews take it upon themselves to “lock” the dimmers at the darkest setting, to make the cabin as dark as possible. While some airlines have told crews to stop doing this, it still happens.

Bottom line

Airbus A350s will be getting new dimmable windows soon, as part of an overall update to the Airspace cabin design.

On the surface I’m not a fan of this development, at least based on how these window shades are currently implemented. However, with the latest generation window shades, it sounds like many of my concerns are addressed. Assuming the window shades can dim more quickly, and get darker than they currently get, then I’m a little less opposed to this development.

To any airlines getting this technology, please emphasize that crews shouldn’t be controlling window settings for the entirety of the flight.

Fortunately it sounds like airlines will be able to opt out of this technology, and Lufthansa is on record as stating that it won’t offer this technology on its Airbus A350s.

What do you make of the Airbus A350 getting dimmable windows?"
Airbus MILSATCOM enlisted for the Czech Armed Forces + the Netherlands – SatNews - SatNews,"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2F0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xMS9haXJidXMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zLWFyZS1lbmxpc3RlZC1mb3ItYXJtZWQtZm9yY2VzLW9mLWN6ZWNoLXJlcHVibGljLWFuZC10aGUtbmV0aGVybGFuZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Satcom UHF.

Airbus has signed contracts with the Ministries of Defense of Czech Republic and the Netherlands to provide satellite communications for a 15-year period. The Armed Forces of Czech Republic and the Netherlands will use 2 and 3 channels respectively of the Airbus UHF (Ultra High Frequency) military communications hosted payload on-board the EUTELSAT 36D telecommunications satellite scheduled for launch in 2024.

EUTELSAT 36D satellite

With this new UHF payload, Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service to the armed forces, particularly those of European countries and NATO allies. As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource, this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed several firm orders for this capacity, well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Center in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable up to 200 simultaneous communications over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, large parts of Asia, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF satcoms are used by the armed forces for operations on land, at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are therefore very useful for multinational and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and offers a lightweight, robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land, at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Defence stands for peace and security, in the Netherlands and elsewhere. With a workforce of 58,000, the Ministry of Defence is one of the biggest employers in the Netherlands.

Jana Černochová Minister of Defence Czech Republic

Airbus has unique experience in operating UHF milsatcom services. This new payload will enhance its portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite. Airbus is the only armed forces private satcom operator to cover the full spectrum of military (UHF, X, Ka Mil) and commercial (L, C/Ku, Ka) frequency bands and applications.

The EUTELSAT 36D satellite will be built by Airbus based on its Eurostar Neo platform. In addition to the UHF payload, it will also be equipped with 70 Ku-band transponders for TV broadcasting."
Satair And Triumph Aviation Services Asia Extend Repair Agreement For Airbus Proprietary Parts - aviator.aero,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL3NhdGFpci1hbmQtdHJpdW1waC1hdmlhdGlvbi1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hc2lhLWV4dGVuZC1yZXBhaXItYWdyZWVtZW50LWZvci1haXJidXMtcHJvcHJpZXRhcnktcGFydHMv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL3NhdGFpci1hbmQtdHJpdW1waC1hdmlhdGlvbi1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hc2lhLWV4dGVuZC1yZXBhaXItYWdyZWVtZW50LWZvci1haXJidXMtcHJvcHJpZXRhcnktcGFydHMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Copenhagen, Denmark, September 1 2022 — Satair, an Airbus Services company, and Triumph Aviation Services Asia (TASA) have signed a multi-year agreement extending the longstanding provisioning of repair station services for Airbus Proprietary Parts powered by Satair.

Since 2015, Satair has partnered with TASA – part of Triumph Group Inc. of the USA -, which has carried out repair services for a wide range of Airbus aircraft operators with a progressive increase in the development of new repair capabilities and onboarding new aircraft programs, like the A350.

Under the new agreement, TASA will provide repair services for Airbus Proprietary Part for all A320, A330, A350 and A380 families, with a special focus on the structural and flight surfaces and including but not limited to rudders, elevators, sharklets, etc.

Michael Bohn, Head of Airbus Product Management, Satair, says “We are constantly pushing the envelope of servicing our customers and we are thrilled to continue our partnership with TASA to bring capable and high-quality repair support for Airbus aircraft operators in the Asia-Pacific and China - a key market of Satair”

In addition to the wide coverage of Airbus platforms, the extension is projected to establish the footprint and readiness to support additional repair services for NextGen aircraft such as the A350, as well as for legacy platforms including the Single Aisle (A320 family), Long Range (A330/340 family) and A380 programs.

“This contract extension is a pivotal milestone in our joint collaborative efforts”, says Monty Richardson, TASA President. “It validates our past successes and the best practices we’ve developed, and also affords new opportunities to align our capabilities and enhances our collaborative potential to address current and future market needs within APAC and China”"
Maverick and Commander: female aviation in the US Coast Guard - Airbus,"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA5LW1hdmVyaWNrLWFuZC1jb21tYW5kZXItZmVtYWxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLWluLXRoZS11cy1jb2FzdC1ndWFyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US Coast Guard Air Station in North Bend, Oregon is the first with an all-female command structure. Captain Breanna Knutson, USCG heads up the primarily search-and-rescue base and talked to us about her career in Coast Guard aviation.

“I love to brag about the women who work for me,” says Capt. Breanna Knutson, Sector Commander for Coast Guard sector North Bend. As one of currently two female commanders of a Coast Guard aviation unit, Capt. Knutson is supported by her Executive Officer, Operations Officer and Command Senior Enlisted Advisor—all of them women, a first for a Coast Guard Air Station.



In Capt. Knutson’s profession, admittedly it has been rare to see women in top command positions. Now, thanks to Coast Guard policies targeting equal opportunity and inclusion, female officers are increasingly seen in the marine blue and gold of this branch of the US Armed Forces.

Captain Breanna Knutson with Executive Officer/Deputy, Cdr. Maegan Schwartz; Operations Officer, Cdr. Tamara Whalen; and Command Senior Enlisted Advisor, Senior Chief Nicole Steele (not pictured).



Taking the lead

“A big part of how I see my job is to inspire people who are junior to me throughout the Coast Guard,” Capt. Knutson says. “This is the first Coast Guard aviation unit with all women in command positions. I love it; I think it’s amazing.”



Inspiring is the operative word. Capt. Knutson oversees 450 people posted at the North Bend Air Station and six boat stations along 220 miles of the Oregon coast. Their primary mission is the search and rescue of commercial fishing and recreational vessels and passengers.



“My main responsibility is to make operational risk management decisions and make sure that we’re sending the right assets. If I receive a brief and I’m confident everything’s being done to go help someone, then I don’t say anything else,” Capt. Knutson says.



Becoming commander of the Coos Bay-based sector has been a journey 23 years in the making. Knutson began her commissioned career aboard a Coast Guard ship in 1999 before enrolling in flight school two years later. “I spoke to pilots and crew of the helicopter deployed on our ship and became interested in the missions they were doing,” she says of her decision.



After graduating from flight school, there followed three tours in North Bend, New Orleans and Jacksonville* as a pilot and aircraft commander. In New Orleans, she was involved in rebuilding the Coast Guard air station that had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina the year before. In Jacksonville, she was assigned to the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON), a counter-narcotics unit.



It was at this point in her career that she was encouraged to apply for a staff job, which led to becoming an executive assistant for the Joint Task Force East within the Department of Homeland Security. Another stint flying, this time in Detroit, Michigan, was followed by a staff job in Washington, D.C. as a congressional liaison. And then, promotion to Commander of Sector North Bend.



Hard work and luck

Despite the impressive resume of exciting jobs, “I don’t feel that my career path was any more challenging than my peers’ in terms of being a woman. You definitely have to request the more demanding ops and do a variety of missions. I’ve done Rotary Wing Air Intercept, which is a separate qualification; I’ve done Airborne Use of Force. You have to take those hard jobs,” she says.



Nevertheless, having advisors played a critical role for her. “Back when I made Aircraft Commander, I was never looking to be a Commanding Officer. People encouraged me to take staff jobs that I didn’t think I was qualified to do. I was lucky to have mentors in my career who supported me.”



As for her sector’s current juncture having an all-women command, the Coast Guard’s policies might well have played a part for Executive Officer/Deputy, Cdr. Maegan Schwartz; Operations Officer, Cdr. Tamara Whalen; and Command Senior Enlisted Advisor, Senior Chief Nicole Steele. Officers typically stand long hours of duty and move every three to four years—playing havoc on family and making retention of mid-grade female officers a challenge. To become a Commanding Officer, they must first be assigned to a pre-command position, like Capt. Knutson’s Deputy and her Operations Officer. “We’re starting to see more women in these pre-command positions, which is the right direction,” she says.



An aviator first

She is surprised that she has continued quite so long in Coast Guard aviation. After completing flight school, she owed the agency 13 years of required service. “I knew aviation was the only career path in the Coast Guard where I would have been willing to obligate those years of service. I love flying and I love the missions we do in Coast Guard aviation.”



The Coast Guard – which is charged with ensuring the maritime and environmental security of US ports, coastlines and waterways – numbers cutters, boats and aircraft among its assets. Its MH-65 helicopters operate in missions ranging from sling operations to airborne use of force. Even as a Commanding Officer, Capt. Knutson still flies once a week “to mix the fun time in with the rest of what I do.” In a recent mission, she did a medical evacuation from a ship 50 miles offshore. “It is not often anymore that I get to be directly involved in the rescue portion of a mission,” she says. “It always feels great to be able to help people who need it – that never gets old!”

An airline rescued an Airbus plane stranded in Ukraine for seven months in a daring mission.

Flightradar24 data appeared to show the WizzAir jet flying at 10,000 feet with its transponder off.

WizzAir confirmed it repatriated the jet on Tuesday following an ""in-depth risk assessment.""

An airline rescued one of its planes stranded in Ukraine in a daring escape that involved flying at a low altitude and turning off its transponder, data suggests.

Budapest-based Wizz Air repatriated one of four Airbus jets that have been stranded in the country since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

Data from Flightrader24 showed that the Airbus A320 flew from Lviv in western Ukraine to Katowice in neighboring Poland on Tuesday. The jet was flying at 10,000 feet when it eventually reappeared on radar as it entered Polish airspace after appearing to switch off its tracking system.

Ukraine's airspace has been largely closed to passenger jets since Russia's invasion, as have a number of its airports, leaving four Wizz Air jets stranded for nearly seven months.

Flying at a low altitude may have helped the jet avoid being detected by radar or anti-aircraft missiles.

An airline spokesperson told Insider: ""Wizz Air confirms that, following an in-depth risk assessment and thorough preparation, its one aircraft based in Lviv departed from Danylo Halytskyi International Airport and successfully landed in Katowice on 13 Sep 2022.""

The rescue mission marks the first step in Wizz's plans to rescue its jets. The airline didn't comment on plans to liberate the remaining three Airbus planes that are still stuck in Kyiv.

Wizz Air is one of several airlines and leasing companies whose jets remain stranded in Ukraine and Russia. Global market leader AerCap has 152 planes trapped in Russia and Ukraine, according to aviation consultancy IBA.

The airline has long expressed a desire to start flying again to both Ukrainian and Russian cities. In March it offered 100,000 free tickets to Ukrainians in neighboring countries.

Last month the airline told Gulf News that it planned to return to Russia with an Abu Dhabi to Moscow route in October, before backpedaling citing ""industry supply chain limitations.""

DALLAS – Hungarian low-cost carrier (LCC) Wizz Air (W6) is to exercise purchase rights on a further 75 Airbus A321neo airliners. The move forms part of the airline’s expansion plans to have 500 jets across the company by 2030.

W6 ordered 102 of the European-built aircraft back in November 2021. The deal signed at the 2021 Dubai Airshow included 75 A320neos and 27 A321XLRs to be delivered between 2025 and 2027. Purchase rights were also given on an additional 75 aircraft for delivery between 2028 and 2029.

The delivery dates are now subject to approval from the airline’s shareholders, as well as finalizing the agreement with Airbus.

Future Growth

Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi said, “The combination of Wizz Air’s ultra-low-cost operation and the market-leading Airbus A321neo aircraft together create a strong platform for Wizz Air’s future growth in the coming decade as we further strengthen our position as one of the world’s most sustainable airlines.

It has not yet been confirmed which of W6’s subsidiaries, which include Wizz Air Abu Dhabi (5W), Wizz Air UK (W9), and the soon-to-be-launched Wizz Air Malta, will receive the aircraft.

Growth during 2022 has been slower than anticipated, owing to the ongoing labor shortages and effects of the pandemic.

Wizz Air currently operates a fleet of 165 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft.

Ethiopian Airlines Weighs New Airbus or Embraer Aircraft Order as Travelers Return - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Tue, 06 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9ldGhpb3BpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtd2VpZ2hzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtb3ItZW1icmFlci1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlci1hcy10cmF2ZWxlcnMtcmV0dXJuL9IBgQFodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvZXRoaW9waWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXdlaWdocy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLW9yLWVtYnJhZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXItYXMtdHJhdmVsZXJzLXJldHVybi8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ethiopian Airlines is keen to expand its lead in the African aviation market with plans for new aircraft to meet rising travel demand.

The Addis Ababa-based Star Alliance carrier expects passenger numbers to surpass 2019 levels during the year ending in June 2023, group CEO Mesfin Tasew Bekele said at a luncheon in Washington, D.C., on September 2. With the passenger recovery in sight, the airline plans to restart an aircraft order campaign for a roughly 100-seat plane that was paused in early 2020 when the pandemic hit. The aircraft, which Bekele said will be either the Airbus A220-100 or Embraer E195-E2, are needed to Ethiopian’s traffic growth forecasts.

“We are going to finalize our evaluation” of a 100-seat aircraft, he said. Bekele hinted that the A220 “best fits Ethiopian Airlines’ market,” and that Airbus had provided the best commercial terms.

An A220 order from Ethiopian would further expand the plane’s growing dominance of the 100-seat aircraft market. Owing to its small size and low costs it proved one of the more popular planes for airlines’ to fly during the pandemic, and coming out of the crisis has racked up a number of new orders. New commitments have come from existing operators, like Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways, and from new customers, including ITA Airways and Qantas. If Ethiopian ordered the A220, it would join the likes of Air Tanzania and EgyptAir operating the jet in Africa.

A roughly 100-seat A220 would sit between Ethiopian’s De Havilland Dash 8-400s with 78 seats and its Boeing 737-800s with at least 154 seats. The airline plans to retire its 9 737-700s that seat 118 passengers in the next few years, Bekele said.

Bekele was bullish on the recovery at Ethiopian, even as conflict in the airline’s namesake country continues. Asked about the impact of U.S. and EU restrictions on government travel through Addis Ababa — for example, all U.S. Embassy staff are barred from transiting through the city’s airport — he said the airline did not “see traffic decline as a result of this,” and cited the hubs status as a major connecting point for travel within and to Africa.

Passenger “traffic is doing well, and it’s growing,” he said broadly. During Ethiopian’s fiscal year that ended in June, passenger numbers hit 82 percent of 2019 levels, or 8.7 million travelers. That percentage was slightly better than previous forecasts for the period by airline executives.

For the eight months ending in February, Ethiopian carried 7 percent fewer passengers on 2 percent more seats on its flights to the U.S. compared to the same period ending in February 2020, according to the latest Department of Transportation data via Diio.

Ethiopian and other carriers are also benefitting from other African airlines’ challenges. Both Kenya Airways and South African Airways struggled during the crisis with the latter shutting down entirely for 18 months. Air France, Delta, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and United Airlines have all used the opportunity to expand to Africa with new flights and routes compared to 2019, Diio schedules show.

Ethiopian continues to grow out of the crisis, and not just in Addis. In June, it launched new nonstop flights between Washington Dulles and Lomé, Togo, where its affiliate Asky Airlines is based. The airline plans to increase the number of flights on that route to five-times weekly by year-end from thrice weekly today, and to daily in 2023, Bekele said.

In addition, Ethiopian is considering new U.S. service to Atlanta, and a resumption of flights to Houston Intercontinental that it flew for just six months before they were suspended in May 2020. “We would like to open up more destinations — providing more connectivity with the United States [and] Africa,” Bekele said. He did not provide a timeline for a potential Atlanta or Houston launch.

The U.S. is not the only place where Ethiopian is expanding. The airline will begin thrice-weekly flights between Addis Ababa and Amman, Jordan, on September 19. It also added Chennai and Dubai’s Al Maktoum airport to its map earlier this year, according to Diio by Cirium schedules."
Delta just scheduled its shortest Airbus A350 international route - The Points Guy,"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWF0bGFudGEtbGltYS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta's flagship aircraft, the Airbus A350, will soon be flying a new international route.

The Atlanta-based carrier filed plans over the weekend to deploy the A350 on its daily service from Atlanta to Lima, Peru, as first seen in Cirium schedules and later confirmed by the carrier. The airline will continue flying the Boeing 767-300 to the Jorge Chávez International Airport (LIM) through Feb. 15, 2023, after which it'll start deploying the A350 on this service.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Interestingly, the Lima service won't be flown by Delta's most premium A350. The carrier offers two configurations of the Airbus wide-body jet: one that features the signature Delta One Suites and Premium Select products and another that the airline acquired used from LATAM that still features the carrier's legacy two-cabin configuration.

These ex-LATAM A350s are currently outfitted with 30 Delta One seats in a forward-facing 2-2-2 configuration, along with 63 Comfort+ seats and 246 standard Main Cabin ones.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Delta eventually plans to retrofit these planes into its signature A350 configuration, but for now, you'll find the old LATAM seats reupholstered in Delta's color palette flying to Lima (and elsewhere). While the business-class product isn't nearly as spacious or private as Delta One Suites, it does offer one of the most comfortable lie-flat beds in the Delta fleet.

This move represents a major upgauge for the Atlanta to Lima service. Previously, the Boeing 767-300 operating the route featured a total of 226 seats, while the high-density ex-LATAM A350 features 339 seats, which is a roughly 50% increase.

For families and couples traveling together, the 2-2-2 business-class configuration may actually be an improvement over the airline's aging 1-2-1 product on the 767-300 fleet.

While the Lima route will be Delta's shortest international one operated by an A350, the airline regularly flies this jet on much shorter domestic missions during downtime or to reposition the aircraft between long-haul flights.

Flying on a wide-body plane on short domestic and international routes is a great way to experience an upgraded product without a major splurge for a long-haul ticket.

Malaysia Airlines A380s Find New Owner - Airways Magazine,"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vbWFsYXlzaWEtYWlybGluZXMtYTM4MHMtbmV3LW93bmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Malaysia Airlines A380s Find New Owner

DALLAS – After a series of attempts to sell the Airbus A380, Malaysia Airlines (MH) has found a new owner, Airbus. The dispatch came through Kuala Lumpur’s The New Straits Times.

The plan to give away the A380s was part of the recent deal where MH ordered 20 new A330-900 aircraft.

“The plan is for them (Airbus) to take back all the aircraft (A380) by the end of this year. It’s up to them what they want to do with the aircraft.”

“The discussion is ongoing. It’s a work in progress,” sources told The New Straits Times.

The downfall of Malaysia’s A380s

Last July, MH listed its A380s for sale, either the entire aircraft or parts. We’ve already passed July 2022, and nothing has happened. Solution? It’s time to get rid of them for good by the end of this year. Goes to say that there’s absolutely zero second-hand market for the A380.

A MAG spokesperson said the group planned to retire and exit the A380 by the end of 2022, as stated in the New Straight Times. “However, the terms related to the deal with Airbus remain confidential,” the spokesperson said when asked about the deal.” An Airbus spokesperson also cited a similar comment, saying, “the terms of our agreement with MAG are confidential.”

Malaysia Airlines CEO Captain Izham Ismail said in June that the aircraft was not included in the airline’s fleet anymore due to the sky-high operating costs of the type.

“If you look at future aircraft technologies, it’s all about twin-engine and long-range. So, if you want to be competitive, you cannot put an A380 in play because the operating cost is high.”

“It will not bring you to the level playing field to be competitive. No doubt the product on the A380 is superior, but at the end of the day it (comes down to) profit and loss,” he said.

Short-lived MH A380 Network and Future Fate?

The first A380 for MH came in May 2012 (MSN 78), and the remaining five joined the carrier by the following March. As the pandemic broke, all six were grounded and have remained in the state ever since. How were they configured and where did they fly to?

A solid 412 seats in Economy, 66 in Business, and 8 in First. Primarily operated on the Kuala Lumpur (KUL) – London Heathrow (LHR) route, twice a day in each direction. Paris (CDG) also was another European destination. Hong Kong (HKG) and Sydney (SYD), Australia were also on its network. During the Hajj season, The A380s flew rigorously to Mediana (MED).

As for the incoming 20 A330-900, 10 will be directly purchased and the remaining 10 will be leased. So what happens to the six A380s after Airbus receives them? Another shot at a resell, convert it into a demonstrator or as a research bed, or strip it apart and auction its parts?

American Airlines reveals A321XLR and B787-9 interiors - Aircraft Interiors International,"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmNyYWZ0aW50ZXJpb3JzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJsaW5lLW5ld3MvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQtb3ZlcmhhdWwuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines has revealed exciting new interiors for its Airbus A321XLR and Boeing 787-9 aircraft, due for delivery from 2024. The headline development is the Flagship Suite, a seat that sits somewhere between the airline’s current Flagship Business class and Flagship First in terms of luxury and experience, with a privacy door, a ‘chaise longue’ relaxed seating option and more personal storage space.

The B787-9 Flagship Suite is based on Adient Aerospace’s Ascent platform, optimised for Boeing cabins, customised in conjunction with Teague, and trimmed in fabrics from Tapis. For the narrowbody A321XLRs it has been suggested that the Collins Aurora seat has been chosen.

The new long-haul cabins will have more premium seating installed than on their current counterparts – indeed 45% more – with the B787-9s due to be fitted with 51 Flagship Suites seats and 32 premium economy seats. The Airbus A321XLR aircraft will feature 20 Flagship Suites and 12 premium economy seats.

Those Premium Economy seats are also new, and custom-designed for more privacy than the current model, with double the amount of in-seat storage space. The model? Customisation makes it difficult to say, but it appears to have much in common with the ZIMprivacy model.

Retrofits too

American also intends to retrofit its Boeing 777-300ER fleet with Flagship Suites. These 20 aircraft will be refreshed with the new interior schemes starting in late 2024, to include 70 Flagship Suite seats and 44 Premium Economy seats.

American will also retrofit its Airbus A321T fleet with new cabins, to align those 16 aircraft with the rest of its A321 fleet. American will continue to offer lie-flat seats on its transcontinental routes departing New York and Boston along with its Northeast Alliance partner, JetBlue Airways.

“We are enhancing the customer experience across their entire journey with American,” said Julie Rath, American’s VP of customer experience. “The arrival of new long-haul aircraft and the customised seat design of the Flagship Suite seats will offer customers a truly private premium experience on our long-haul fleet.”"
"Spoiled By New Planes, I Can't Stand Flying On Older Aircraft - God Save The Points","Sun, 25 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL25ldy1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"So noisy, so dry… and so old. That’s pretty much all I could think about, as I crossed the pond for the second time this week, aboard a Boeing 767-300ER.

The last time I had that feeling, I was in first class, on a 26 year old Boeing 777-200. I mention that purely to say that even the “best” class of service doesn’t always feel up to scratch on these older planes, once you’ve gotten used to the newer generation of aircraft.

The thing is, I’ve gotten spoiled. First world, I know, but it’s a real conversation at this point. If you haven’t experienced one of the newer long haul aircraft flying, you really should.

It’s not partisan, in fact both Airbus and Boeing have phenomenal competing aircraft, with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus A350 respectively. Each brings a notably better cabin experience.

Here’s what you need to know about these newer aircraft, and why I actively try my best to end up on one for the sake of my body.

New Vs Old: Passenger Experience

Do I have a cold? Or the other “c-word” — I don’t think so — I tested plenty — but I’ve definitely felt more refreshed, even after longer flights.

To me, that mental conversation is the primary difference between flying on a newer generation plane and the remarkably reliable, but not so “passenger friendly” plane I was on.

On a Boeing 787, Airbus A220 or Airbus A350, I can talk to someone across the aisle without remotely raising my voice. On an older generation Airbus A330, Boeing 777 or 767, you just hear a constant stream of intensely dry air drowning out other noises. The only benefit, in retrospect, was it helped dull the sound of farts in the air. It’s true!

Loud and dry, that’s the rally cry. Newer planes have solved that, thanks to new composite fuselage materials which require less intensive pressurization to keep us all sane and safe. Here are a few things you might notice, if you do a side by side flying comparison.

Better Humidity

Both the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 offer higher humidity levels, which keep your throat, nostrils and other key areas from going quite as dry. When these things become dry, they’re more susceptible to illness, so aside from feeling better, it is better.

Better humidity doesn’t mean it feels like stepping out in Singapore, but rather, just a lot less like stepping into the arctic. It’s a more natural cabin environment for the body, much more akin to what we feel down on the ground.

Larger Windows

This is a novelty, but larger windows are a major feature. The stronger materials used to build these planes allow for more liberties with design, and the 787 and A350 offer huge windows. Stargazing, or cloud surfing has never been better.

These large windows can help with things like claustrophobia for some passengers and just generally create a feeling of greater space. Fascinatingly, the Airbus A350-1000 was designed with “vertical side walls” to minimize the plane curvature at passenger level, so people don’t feel as confined.

Less Noise

Noise is a thing on planes. That constant whisking of dry air can grate on you after a few hours on board. Both of these newer generation planes claim to be at least 20% less noisy than legacy aircraft. I’d say that’s conservative.

You really can chat without raising your voice and feel a noticeable difference in calm. It’s a fantastic cabin experience that you really must “hear” to believe.

Have You Flown On A Newer Aircraft?

Look, I might be more focused on this stuff than the average traveler, but I feel a very noticeable difference in flight. I know many I’ve spoken to tend to agree. With that said, I’d love to hear what you think."

Airbus has started the flight test campaign of the A400M military transport aircraft with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The campaign is being executed by the company’s A400M programme team in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space division’s Military Air Systems unit.

The first test under this campaign was performed at the company’s San Pablo facility in Seville in July.

The aircraft travelled more than an hour towards the north of Huelva and safely returned to Seville.

Airbus said that the maiden test was successful and involved using a blended load of 29% SAF in one of the aircraft’s engines.

Limiting the use of SAF to one engine allowed the team to analyse the behaviour of the fuel system.

Airbus Defence and Space flight test engineer César González said: “During the flight, we performed a close comparison between engine number-2, one using SAF, and the other three engines using standard fuel Jet A1, so we had a very good opportunity to compare the performance of different fuels.

“The results we got confirmed that using this blended SAF does not affect engines or aircraft performance, so the A400M can receive the whole potential of it in terms of environmental benefit.”

The test further validated that the new fuel, which is a blend of 50% certified SAF, is compatible with A400M aircraft and its TP400-D6 engines.

Expected to be a proven alternative fuel, SAF can minimise carbon dioxide emissions by up to 85%, in comparison to traditional fuel.

Airbus will now establish a roadmap to achieve 100% SAF certification and readiness for A400M aircraft for a more sustainable military aviation.

The company has also received approval from EuroProp International, a company responsible for the TP400-D6 engine’s design, development and manufacturing."

Will the Airbus Beluga become the next Antonov An-225 Mriya? - AeroTime,"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzIyNTItYWlyYnVzLWJlbHVnYS1uZXh0LWFudG9ub3YtYW4tMjI1LW1yaXlh0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMjI1Mi1haXJidXMtYmVsdWdhLW5leHQtYW50b25vdi1hbi0yMjUtbXJpeWEvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the An-225 Mriya destroyed and the global Antonov freighter fleet not readily available, Airbus presented an alternative for the transportation of outsized military cargo.

For the past year and a half, Airbus Defense & Space has developed a self-funded cargo loading system and jig to “load heavy military cargo” into the Airbus Beluga A300-600ST aircraft

“The demand for outsized air cargo capability is on the rise. Capacity is scarce and, in light of current geopolitical developments, many customers are looking for new, fast and efficient solutions. This is exactly what we offer with our BelugaST fleet,” said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.

In collaboration with the Bundeswehr [the German armed forces – ed. note], the European manufacturer demonstrated the ability to load a Sikorsky CH-53 military heavy transport helicopter “in a reduced state of dismantling” into the BelugaST within less than an hour and a half.

The five BelugaST of Airbus Transport International were initially used to transport parts of the manufacturer’s airliners between production sites. They are being progressively replaced by six new-generation BelugaXL aircraft, which provide an upgrade in both cargo volume and mass.

A fitting substitute?

Until now, part of the strategic airlift for NATO and European Union member states was provided by Antonov Logistics SALIS, a German-based subsidiary of Antonov Company that kept two An-124-100s on standby at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEJ) and several more Antonov freighters available on request.

However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine greatly disrupted that capacity. Several aircraft were either destroyed or damaged during the battle of Hostomel Airport (GML), where Antonov Company was based. The Russian attack led to the destruction of the unique Antonov An-225 Mriya.

Though impressive in size with its distinctive whale-like silhouette, the BelugaST, and even its upgraded successor, can hardly compete with the performance of the Antonov An-124-100 Ruslan, let alone the late An-225 Mriya.

The system’s total lifting capacity, which requires no crane for its use, reaches 35 tons, according to the manufacturer. As a matter of comparison, the Ruslan can transport up to 150 tons, and the Mriya could airlift an outstanding 250 tons.

However, the BelugaST could very well be a stopgap solution before a better replacement is found. The Bundeswehr is to certify the solution in the coming weeks. France, whose military deployments heavily relied on the Antonov fleet, could be another potential customer.

As early as November 2021, the European Defence Agency identified a “critical shortfall for strategic transport for outsized and heavy cargo, a crucial enabler for military missions and operations.”

Consequently, the Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo (SATOC) project was launched, under which Germany (as project coordinator), France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia will be “harmonizing requirements and […] identifying and agreeing on a common European solution for the transport of outsized cargo.”

The initial study will run until 2023, with the potential solutions (which may include the development of a new aircraft) to be worked out by 2026."
