"Airbus unveils its ""Smarter Skies"" vision for the future of sustainable aviation - New Atlas","Sun, 09 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLXNtYXJ0ZXItc2tpZXMvMjQwNTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new report drafted by Airbus as part of its “Smarter Skies” initiative sees the aircraft manufacturing company looking toward 2050 and beyond, in order to consider what can be done to meet the expected growth in future air travel sustainably. The ambitious plans put forward include assisted take-off, free-glide landings, and aircraft flying in formation.

In the report, Airbus explains that the initial power required for a passenger plane to take-off is only needed for a brief part of the total flight. This therefore poses an opportunity for a ground-based device to provide the propulsion needed and free the plane of its additional burden. With this in mind, the engineers at Airbus came up with an idea dubbed ""eco-climb"" which appears to draw inspiration from the catapult-assisted take-off system utilized on aircraft carriers.

Airbus envisages the eco-climb system moving into position automatically and assisting passenger planes to take-off on shorter runways, with the benefit of a more rapid climb enabling aircraft to reach efficient cruising altitude quicker than before. A key concern in implementing such a design rests in keeping g-force within acceptable levels, and one can imagine such a system requiring ample stores of on-board sick bags.

The eco-climb concept would enable passenger planes to reach fuel-efficient cruising altitudes more quickly

Perhaps more practical for the somewhat near future, are the company's thoughts on landing more economically. Airbus promoted the benefits of a free-glide approach to airports, which could reduce emissions during the overall descent and limit noise too, as there would be no need for engine thrust or air breaking. However, even this idea would face a challenge to surmount current safety regulations.

Another possibility put forward concerns flying multiple aircraft in ""express skyways,"" with the use of highly sophisticated and automated aircraft navigation systems to bring passenger planes to within 20 wingspans of each other – much less than the four nautical miles which separates civil aircraft today, but still technically feasible. Just like migratory birds and military aircraft, commercial aircraft flying in a V formation would benefit from reduced drag due to the upwash from the wingtip vortices of the preceding aircraft, resulting in greater fuel efficiency.

Airbus also states that by further optimizing Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems and making better use of existing aircraft capabilities, changes in infrastructure and organization, could help reduce traffic congestion and delays, while more direct routes could cut travel times.

The company claims that flights in Europe and the U.S. could be around 13 minutes shorter on average, and flights in other parts of the world could be shorter too. Working on the assumption of approximately 30 million flights per year, the Airbus engineers worked out that such optimization could save around nine million tons of excess fuel annually, equating to over 28 million tons of avoidable CO2 emissions and a saving of five million hours of excess flight time.

While some of the plans cited in the Smarter Skies report will not be attainable for some time, if ever, optimization of existing technologies is something that could provide benefits to airlines and passengers in the near future.

"Airbus's vision for ""smarter skies"" - The Economist","Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZ3VsbGl2ZXIvMjAxMi8wOS8xNC9haXJidXNzLXZpc2lvbi1mb3Itc21hcnRlci1za2llc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By A.B.

A COUPLE of years ago I wrote about Airbus’s development of a concept plane, whose glossy details were published in a document called “The Future by Airbus”. That, it transpires, was just the beginning of the aeroplane-maker's mission to encourage a discussion (and show off its own ideas) about aviation in 2050. The next instalment of this futurological project, “smarter skies”, includes suggestions for changes Airbus thinks might be taking place outside the cabin.

These are five-fold:



Eco-climb – save energy by launching aircraft using an assisted-take-off mechanism. Since planes use so much power to leave the ground, the idea is to source that power from devices on the ground, rather than have them weighing down the plane. Then you could shorten the runways and lighten the aircraft, which would reach cruising altitude faster than at present.



Express skyways – planes travelling in formation (pictured), like a flock of birds, will use less energy. In Airbus's example, three aircraft heading east from Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco would meet over Utah and fly onwards together. Planes could also reduce the distances they have to fly if they take genuinely direct routes between A and B, rather than zig-zagging round different countries' airspace.



Free-glide approaches and landings – with better air-traffic management planes would be able to glide smoothly into airports, as opposed to descending in stages and wasting energy.

Ground operations – ""autonomous receiving vehicles"" that would get planes from runway to gate faster are among the ideas for improving operations at the airport.



Power - biofuels and other alternative sources of energy would reduce CO2 emissions and improve the security of energy supply.

That's a reasonable mix of the interesting and the obvious. It can be tricky with these sorts of document to avoid saying little more than ""do things better than they are done now""—and Airbus just about avoids that. Some of the ideas, such as the vehicles that help move aircraft around airports, are already with us, as this week's Economistdescribes. And if that's not enough excitement for a Friday, here is the light show with which Airbus launched this latest project in Berlin."
Airbus parent EADS and BAE in merger talks - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDEyLzkvMTMvYWlyYnVzLXBhcmVudC1lYWRzLWFuZC1iYWUtaW4tbWVyZ2VyLXRhbGtz0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDEyLzkvMTMvYWlyYnVzLXBhcmVudC1lYWRzLWFuZC1iYWUtaW4tbWVyZ2VyLXRhbGtz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Based on 2011 numbers, combined company would have sales of an estimated $92bn and as many as 220,000 employees.

EADS, the parent of Airbus, is in merger talks with Britain’s BAE Systems in a deal that would topple Boeing to become the world’s biggest aerospace giant.

Shareholders of EADS, or European Aeronautic, Defence & Space, would own 60 per cent of the combined group and BAE shareholders the remainder, BAE said in a statement.

Based on 2011 numbers, the combined company would have sales of about $92bn and 220,000 employees.

“BAE Systems and EADS have a long history of collaboration and are currently partners in a number of important projects including the Eurofighter,” BAE systems said in a statement.

BAE and EADS operates defence businesses in the US, UK, Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Australia, among other countries. As such the companies have begun talking to governments about the implications, BAE said.

“On the face of it, this will create one of the largest aerospace and defence organisations on the planet [depending on how much they have to spin out to get this past regulators], and change the European defence market beyond recognition,” Guy Anderson, defence analyst at IHS Jane’s, said.

“But a merger between BAE and EADS is unlikely and wouldn’t happen without a lot of trials and tribulations. It would have to navigate onerous regulatory hurdles and sell off many overlapping chunks along the way.

“If it did go ahead, it would create a Goliath in terms of scale, putting BAE/EADS ahead of Boeing in revenues. However, there is no telling how much of the combined offering would have to be sold off to satisfy regulators.”

National interests

Jim McNerney, Boeing chief executive, told Reuters news agency that his company was not threatened by the talks, and there may be more mergers in the defence industry as military spending in the US and Europe declines.

European governments have tried to engineer a merger in the past, but national interests have thwarted efforts. And BAE sold its stake in Airbus in 2006 to concentrate on its defence business.

“There is also an element of history repeating itself,” Anderson said. “The Blair government was trying to steer British Aerospace [as it was then] towards DASA of Germany in the late 1990s. DASA tied up with Matra of France to form EADS, and the rest was history. British Aerospace, meanwhile, tied up with Marconi to form BAE Systems.

“There is a political dimension. The fact that the UK will keep a stake of sorts in the combined group bodes well and the UK-France defence pact shows that pragmatism can prevail.

“While the UK government holds a so-called golden share in BAE Systems, France and Germany have ensured the maintenance of a Franco-German balance in EADS through both private and state-holdings.”"

In a delivery ceremony in Toulouse, the new aircraft was handed over to Captain Montree Jumrieng, Executive Vice President Technical at Thai, by Airbus’s Kiran Rao, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing.

Thai, which ordered a total of six A380s, will become the ninth operator of the world’s largest commercial aircraft in early October when it launches A380 service on its Bangkok-Hong Kong and Bangkok-Singapore routes. Flights to Frankfurt, Tokyo and Paris will follow.

The three class plane is outfitted with 507 seats divided among 12 private First Class suites, 60 lie-flat Royal Silk Class seats, and 435 Economy seats. Every seat features personal in-flight entertainment systems, USB and power outlets.

Powered by four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the A380’s 8,500 nm range will allow Thai to reach any destination in Europe nonstop, and reach any US city with one stop.

“With the A380 Thai will elevate its Royal Orchid Service to a new level,” said Montree Jumrieng, Thai’s Executive Vice President Technical. “In every class we are offering a new dimension in passenger appeal, from redesigned seating to the latest entertainment systems. These features, combined with the aircraft’s quiet and spacious cabin, will truly make the Thai A380 the smoothest way to fly.”

“We are extremely proud to welcome Thai as the latest operator of the A380,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “Today Thai joins a group of world class airlines that are redefining on-board comfort while flying more efficiently. With the A380 THAI will be well placed to meet the strong growth in air travel in the Asia-Pacific region in the most cost-effective way possible.”"

Airbus predicts catapult takeoffs and formation flying by 2050 - The Register,"Fri, 07 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA5LzA3L2FpcmJ1c19zbWFydGVyX3NraWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has detailed its plans for the future of air travel in 2050, when megacities and rising fuel costs will make flying a very different kettle of (flying) fish.

The company's ""Smarter Skies"" report has been two years in the making, using interviews within the aviation industry and with designers to come up with radical new aircraft and infrastructure designed to cope with the future cost of fuel and the limits placed on airports by the growth of megacities.

""Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with 'disruptive' ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to,"" said Charles Champion, Airbus VP of engineering in a statement.

""These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimizing the environment in which the aircraft operates. That is why our latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly but, how we may fly in 2050 and beyond.""

Aircraft will become totally recyclable, the report predicts, using interior fittings that are grown from vegetable matter and which will be self-cleaning and repairing. Bulkheads could be made of materials that can become transparent – which might cause some people with a fear of heights some problems – and the wings could change and adapt to different wind conditions for maximum efficiency.

Advances in design and materials science will make aircraft engines much more reliable and reduce the need for servicing, so they can be built into the hull of the aircraft for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. Airbus predicts that with the right incentives, biofuel will be used for 30 per cent of flights by 2030, which could rise to 50 per cent by 2050. Solar power and fuel cells could also augment the engines.

In 2050, flying begins with flinging

Once you're on board and strapped in, Airbus proposes that the energy needed to get you aloft could be cut drastically by using a catapult systems similar to that used on aircraft carriers today. This ""renewably powered, propelled acceleration"" system would be low-G enough for everyday travelers and would allow for shorter runways to save space – although the graphic of the takeoff angle suggests a lot of spilled drinks and freefalling cabin crew.

'Our cabin crew will be passing along the plane at freefall speeds' (click to enlarge)

Once aloft the aircraft will use predictive software to work out the most fuel-efficient route to its objective, and on busy flight paths aircraft would be coordinated to fly in formation to save fuel, just as birds and military aircraft do. The air vortices from the wings of the lead craft will provide free lift for those aircraft following, although the risk of collision might unnerve some passengers.

Taking a tip from the animal kingdom (click to enlarge)

In order to save yet more energy and reduce noise pollution, Airbus suggests allowing planes to power down their engines well before landing and glide onto the runway on momentum alone. This is possible today: in 2001 an Airbus A330-243 ran out of fuel mid-Atlantic and glided over 60 miles to land in the Azores. Aviation authorities, however, insist on powered landing for safety reasons.

It is possible that future landings will also be more complex. Airbus postulates that aircraft could land directly on a moving platform which would then shuttle it off the runway and to the airport building without needing to restart the engines. Since this would require every aircraft and airport to be outfitted with such a system, the European plane manufacturer admits this is quite a long shot.

All this futuristic stuff is good enough for 2050, but Airbus says significant savings could be made right now using currently available technology. Airbus estimates that if the current crop of air traffic management systems were properly used, the average flight time would be 13 minutes shorter and the industry could save nine million tons of fuel a year. ®"
Airbus 2050: the details are all in the future | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLTIwNTAtdGhlLWRldGFpbHMtYXJlLWFsbC1pbi10aGUtZnV0dXJlLzEwNjk2OC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has, for several years now, been promoting a vision of air travel in 2050. Starting with the basic structure, the ""concept plane"" was an attempt to imagine what might come to be if materials and aerodynamic ideas could be combined into a sort of ""engineer's dream"".

Airbus readily admitted that the result was ""a package of technologies that are unlikely ever to coexist in such a manner"". The package was pretty - ultra-long and slim wings, semi-embedded engines, a U-shaped tail - but not especially radical as visions of the future go.

Far more thought-provoking fare came a year later. On the eve of the 2011 Paris air show, Airbus fleshed out some more radical notions of the passenger-aircraft interface, particularly inside the cabin.

Imagine, for example, an aircraft built of intelligent membranes that turn from opaque to transparent on command, to do away with windows and provide a panoramic view of the sky. Enhanced reality projection could add to the scene, or even turn it into images tailored to suit each passenger. Indeed, Airbus imagines palm-recognition check-in, so the aircraft would know each passenger intimately and, thanks to its smart materials and neural networks, be able to learn their preferences for, say, cabin lighting, or even seat shape.

Other ideas may be less esoteric. Bionic-inspired structures that mimic birds' bones - strong where needed and light everywhere else - are already on the drawing board, and energy-harvesting techniques to capture passengers' body heat to power onboard systems are already in use in the Stockholm metro.

Hydrogen fuel cells could provide emission-free onboard electric power while on the ground, while solar panels on the wings and fuselage could be another way to provide some onboard power.

Also probably much closer than 2050 are self-repairing materials that would help keep a cabin in as-new condition. Fully recyclable plant fibres could replace many non-renewable materials used today.

OPERATIONS

Now, with a more careful look at how savings - particularly of fuel - may be found in operations, Airbus has perhaps opened the most interesting aspect of what it hopes will be a wide-ranging debate over the future of air travel. As some of its latest ideas could conceivably be put into practice with little modification of the existing aircraft fleet, it may not be necessary to wait decades for their realisation.

Least controversial among what Airbus executive vice-president engineering Charles Champion describes as ""disruptive ideas"" needed to spur aviation towards its goal of halving carbon emissions by 2050 are two concepts for greater on-the-ground efficiency. One involves using navigation technology to optimise an aircraft's actual landing position, so that an autonomous - and renewably powered - taxi tug could be waiting. The result could be that aircraft could switch off engines sooner but still be quickly pulled off runways, to optimise terminal space and remove runway and gate limitations.

Another is to create regional supplies of sustainable biofuels and energy sources ranging from hydrogen to solar electricity to power airports and aircraft.

Also not wildly futuristic are free-glide approaches and landings, which may be seen as an extension of the so-called 4D flights along optimum paths already being trialled and which are widely held to be possible if next-generation air traffic management systems are put in place. The purpose would be to remain in cruise altitude efficiency for longer, and reduce noise and emissions during approach by taking a steeper descent without engine thrust or air braking.

Airbus

Free-glide approaches would, Champion believes, also reduce landing speed - which would translate into shorter runways.

Also intriguing is Airbus's notion of formation flying. The concept is not new, but, as Champion explains, it may not take a great leap to realisation. Champion estimates that by riding in another aircraft's slipstream at a distance of about 1nm (1.85km), fuel burn could be reduced by 10-15% - about what might be expected by introducing the engines currently under development by Pratt & Whitney and CFM International to replace their popular V2500 and CFM56 narrowbody models around the middle of the decade.

He stresses that there is no question of attempting to maintain formations near airports; the idea only applies during flight in a ""stable trajectory""; for example, over the ocean. And, he says, safety comes first, so for an aircraft to join a queue would always be a pilot-controlled manoeuvre.

Rather more daunting is an idea for assisted take-off. As Airbus presents it, aircraft would be propelled to take-off speed partly by their own engines and partly by a tractor (renewably powered, of course). The result would be quicker acceleration on shorter runways and steeper climb to cruise; aircraft could carry smaller engines, too, saving fuel all around.

What happens to these tractors when they reach the end of the runway at take-off speed, however, is one of those details that still needs to be worked out.

It expects the biggest growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

European jet maker Airbus on Tuesday raised its 20-year industry forecast for aircraft deliveries, expecting healthy long-term growth of global aviation.

Unveiling its global market forecast in London, the plane manufacturer predicted that some 28,200 passenger jets and cargo aircraft would be sold between 2012 and 2031 for a total of $4.0 trillion (3.2 trillion euros).

Airbus stated the world's passenger fleet would more than double to some 32,550 planes as compared with the current level of 15,500 aircraft.

Lucrative deals ahead

""Emerging economic regions will represent more than half of all traffic growth in the next 20 years,"" Airbus said in a statement. CEO John Leahy said China in particular would play a decisive role in the process.

""In 20 years from now, China's domestic passenger traffic will overtake the US domestic traffic to become the number one traffic flow in our forecast,"" Leahy maintained.

He added that there would be strong demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, with about 10,300 passenger planes expected to be replaced by ""greener"" models.

Airbus hopes it will profit most from growing demand worldwide. Last year, the company - a division of European aerospace giant EADS - logged orders for 1,419 planes, compared with rival Boeing's 805.

Air travel in 2050: Autonomous planes flying in geese-like formations - ExtremeTech,"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJlbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9leHRyZW1lLzEzNTc3NC1haXItdHJhdmVsLWluLTIwNTAtYXV0b25vbW91cy1wbGFuZXMtZmx5aW5nLWluLWdlZXNlLWxpa2UtZm9ybWF0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One day in the not-so-distant future, semi-autonomous airplanes will fly through the skies like flocks of geese, reducing drag and saving fuel. This concept is part of a broader plan by airplane maker Airbus to modernize the industry over the next three decades.

""Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with 'disruptive' ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to,"" Airbus' engineering chief Charles Champion says. ""These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates.""

While planes presently fly with about 1,000 feet (300m) of vertical separation between them, computer-controlled planes could fly much closer. The planes' flight control systems could also ingest weather and atmospheric conditions and adjust to constantly fly the best available route, while at the same time maintaining a safe distance from other nearby planes.

This all may sound like an attempt at removing the pilot from the flying process, but Airbus cautions that is not the case.

The pilot is still in control of the aircraft, but the enhanced computer system will act as a backup, smoothing out the natural pilot error. Flying in such close formation obviously requires precision, far more than even the most experienced pilot can provide. Accidents and issues do happen, so Airbus sees it as important for the pilot to still have control. The goal here is efficiency, and the company's research shows that's exactly what such a system provides.

On average, thanks to reduced air resistance -- just like a flock of geese flying in a V formation -- flights will be about 13 minutes shorter, and about 9 million tons of aircraft fuel will be saved. Billions of dollars a year will be saved in fuel costs, which hopefully would have the effect of making air travel cheaper too. There's also an environmental benefit here: 28 million less tons of CO2 emissions would be put into our atmosphere each year.

Besides the more advanced computer systems in planes, Airbus has other concepts(Opens in a new window) that it plans to test, and has set a goal of the year 2050 to deploy these technologies.

In addition to computer controlled flying, Airbus proposes a superfast ground vehicle to launch aircraft into the sky, and free glides into airports. In both cases, this would require much less runway, which means airports could be constructed in highly-populated areas where land comes at a premium. Another time and fuel saving measure is optimizing the taxiing of planes around the airport, by using robotic taxi vehicles powered on renewable energy.

Champion says that while Airbus is serious about making air travel more efficient and cost effective, his company will not be able to do it alone. ""The future of sustainable aviation is the sum of many parts and success will require collaboration amongst all the parties who are passionate about ensuring a successful prospect for aviation,"" he says."
ILA: Airbus sharklet testing turns to A321 | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaWxhLWFpcmJ1cy1zaGFya2xldC10ZXN0aW5nLXR1cm5zLXRvLWEzMjEvMTA2OTQ4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will start test-flying the first A321 with sharklet wing-tips this autumn, as it wraps up testing A320s with the fuel-saving modification.

The airframer will conduct its first display routine with a sharklet-equipped A320 when MSN5098 carries out a demonstration at the ILA show, rehearsals for which were performed yesterday.

Its routine involves a 180kt (330km/h) steep climb to 1,500ft (460m) before a sharp turn back to the display area and a 360˚ orbit at 1,000ft. The A320 then returns and descends to 600ft to execute a slow pass at 120kt, with gear up, before climbing to 2,200ft and turning to land. Test pilots Christophe Cail and Martin Scheuermann will be crewing the jet.

MSN5098 is a CFM International CFM56-powered twinjet but Airbus also began testing an International Aero Engines V2500-equipped version, bearing Qatar Airways colours, in July.

Tests with these aircraft have been complementing the early flight-test campaign with the MSN1 A320 testbed.

Sharklets are intended to shave 3.5% off fuel-burn over longer sectors. They will enter service on CFM56-equipped A320s from the fourth quarter of this year and on the V2500 aircraft from the first quarter of 2013, although Airbus has yet to disclose which customers will be the first to receive them.

Airbus says it plans to put the first sharklet-fitted A321 into the programme in autumn.

It expects to perform 250h of tests, lasting some five months, carrying out back-to-back assessments with the regular wing-tip fence variant because the A321's wing structure differs from the A320's.

Sharklet-equipped A321s will be test-flown with both engine options and both types will enter service in the third quarter of 2013.

""We need to certify individually every combination of aircraft model and engine selection,"" says the airframer.

Testing of the modified A319 will be shorter, running to 120h, with the CFM56 version becoming available in the second quarter of 2013. The V2500 variant will follow in the third quarter, while the A318 - being tested for 90h, and only with CFM56 engines - will enter service in the fourth.

Airbus Sets New Targets for How Flight Should Look by 2050 - The Green Optimistic,"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVub3B0aW1pc3RpYy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNtYXJ0ZXItc2tpZXMtMjA1MC0yMDEyMDkxMi_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbm9wdGltaXN0aWMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1zbWFydGVyLXNraWVzLTIwNTAtMjAxMjA5MTIvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As aviation is nowadays one of the top polluters, aircraft manufacturer Airbus is now sharing their thoughts on how aviation should look by 2050. They devised a handful of measures that should be taken to regulate how fleets should be operated in the most sustainable way possible.

Therefore, they described all of their engineers’ ideas and concepts in the latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies. For example, if the Air Traffic Management and the onboard technology would be upgraded, around 9 million tons of fuel could be saved annually, which would in turn save over 28 million tons of CO2 emitted into the air. That translates into 5 million less spent in the air (per year). That is a staggering 570 years, the lives of 8 people living up to an average of 70.

The Smarter Skies vision contains five concepts.

Quoting Airbus, these are:

Aircraft take-off in continuous ‘eco-climb’ Also read: This Device Extends Your Phone's Battery Lifespan Like Nothing Else. 5% Discount Code: GREENOPT Aircraft launched through assisted take-offs using renewably powered, propelled acceleration, allowing steeper climb from airports to minimise noise and reach efficient cruise altitudes quicker.

As space becomes a premium and mega-cities become a reality, this approach could also minimise land use, as shorter runways could be utilised. Aircraft in free flight and formation along ‘express skyways’ Highly intelligent aircraft would be able to “self-organise” and select the most efficient and environmentally friendly routes (“free flight”), making the optimum use of prevailing weather and atmospheric conditions.

High frequency routes would also allow aircraft to benefit from flying in formation like birds during cruise bringing efficiency improvements due to drag reduction and lower energy use. Low-noise, free-glide approaches and landings Aircraft allowed to take free glide approaches into airports that reduce emissions during the overall decent and reduce noise during the steeper approach as there is no need for engine thrust or air breaking.

These approaches would also reduce the landing speed earlier which would make shorter landing distances achievable (less runway needed). Low emission ground operations On landing aircraft engines could be switched off sooner and runways cleared faster, ground handling emissions could be cut.

Technology could optimise an aircraft’s landing position with enough accuracy for an autonomous renewably powered taxiing carriage to be ready, so aircraft could be transported away from runways quicker, which would optimise terminal space, and remove runway and gate limitations. Powering future aircraft and infrastructure The use of sustainable biofuels and other potential alternative energy sources (such as electricity, hydrogen, solar etc) will be necessary to secure supply and further reduce aviation’s environmental footprint in the long term. This will allow the extensive introduction of regionally sourced renewable energy close to airports, feeding both aircraft and infrastructure requirements sustainably.

Along with these measures, the implementation of electric motors is still an optimistic thought that’s still in its infancy. However, it could be achieved once the electric car industry is put in place and cheaper/better batteries are invented.

One way or another, Airbus already predicts (and hopes) that people will fly more in the future and this should encourage all kinds of cleaner technologies to emerge, just to reduce costs and increase safety.

Holidaymakers may find themselves on planes that are flying in formation to ensure more passengers can reach popular destinations at one time.

Flock: A computer generated image shows futuristic Airbus passenger aircraft flying together in formation. The company believes this could become reality in the second half of the century

PLANES IN 2050: THE AIRBUS IDEAS THAT AIM TO IMPROVE FLYING

Aircraft climbing more steeply on take-off to minimise noise and allow for shorter runways;

Aircraft able to 'self-organise' and select the most efficient and environmentally-friendly routes.

Planes gliding into airports to reduce emissions and reduce noise;

Planes clearing the runway quicker on landing and passengers reaching terminals faster;

The use of sustainable biofuels and other potential energy sources such as electricity, hydrogen and solar power.

The optimisation of air traffic management and on-board technology systems.



Aviation giant Airbus are behind the radical plans which they say could happen as soon as 2050.



Other ambitious plans that could improve the holiday flight include steeper take-offs to reduce journey times and gentler, glide-in landings to improve noise problems and emissions.

Airbus added that by the middle of the 21st century flights in Europe and the USA could on average be around 13 minutes shorter, saving around nine million tonnes of fuel a year.

And highly-intelligent aircraft would be able to 'self-organise' selecting the most efficient and environmentally-friendly routes.

The shorter flights would lead to the saving of more than 28 million tonnes of avoidable C0 2 emissions a year as well as the saving of five million flying hours.

Airbus engineering executive vice president Charles Champion said: 'Our engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with ‘disruptive’ ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 targets we have signed up to.

'These and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the environment in which the aircraft operates.



'That is why our latest Future by Airbus Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly, but how we may fly in 2050 and beyond.

"Sharklets on an A320 Significantly Cut Fuel Consumption, Says Airbus - Softpedia News","Wed, 12 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zb2Z0cGVkaWEuY29tL25ld3MvU2hhcmtsZXRzLW9uLWFuLUEzMjAtU2lnbmlmaWNhbnRseS1DdXQtRnVlbC1Db25zdW1wdGlvbi1TYXlzLUFpcmJ1cy0yOTE2NDQuc2h0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As we previously reported, Airbus has long been making significant efforts towards cutting down the ecological footprint of the aviation industry, either by promoting the use of more environmentally-friendly plane fuels, or by making sure no precious resources are wasted when one aircraft is sent flying from one place to another.

Recent news on this topic informs us that, after carrying out several tests on an A320 fully equipped with innovative sharklets, engineers working with this company found that significant savings have been made in terms of fuel consumption.

More precisely, the official website for Airbus states that fuel consumption was reduced by as much as 3.5% - 4% without this having any consequences on the aircraft's ability to navigate the skies.

John Leahy, presently employed as chief operating officer for Airbus, made a case of how, “These new fuel-saving wingtip devices represent the next phase in our ongoing development of the best-selling A320 Family.”

He further explained that, “They will bring significant reduction in fuel burned: at least 3.5 per cent; in fact, our engineers are telling me that with the flight tests we're completing now, it's closer to 4 per cent.”

Moreover, these sharklets are expected to improve the plane's takeoff performance, and thus contribute even further to cutting down on the amounts of harmful emissions released by the aviation industry on a yearly basis.

In case anyone was wondering, it seems that, should all aircrafts soon be equipped with such devices, each and every one of them will cut its CO2 emission by about 1,000 tons on a yearly basis.

From where we stand, this is good news indeed, especially given the fact that air transportation is presently regarded by most people as one of the most efficient means of getting from one place to another.

Therefore, greening up this particular branch of the transportation industry stands to yield significant benefits in terms of environmental protection."

"Supersizing the superjumbo: Airbus says 1,000 seat A380 due 2020 - Executive Traveller","Wed, 26 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vc3VwZXJzaXppbmctdGhlLXN1cGVyanVtYm8tMS0wMDAtc2VhdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1kdWUtYnktMjAyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says that its upsized A380, capable of carrying up as many as 1,000 passengers, remains on the drawing board for launch in 2020.

Known as the A380-900, it's a big brother to the original A380-800 but was shelved in May 2010 due to soft demand for a supersized superjumbo.

""We have a design for the A380-900 which can be reactivated at the appropriate time"" Bob Lange, Airbus vice-president of marketing for the A380, told Australian Business Traveller.

""My best estimate of that appropriate time at the moment would probably be (to enter service) at the beginning of the next decade.""

Airbus is concentrating its energies on building the A380, Lange says, ""and at the high end of the market we are not seeing the strength of demand to launch that product.""

The A380-900 will carry at least 100 more passengers than current A380-800, with 650 passengers in a standard multi-class configuration and over 900 passengers if filled with with economy-only seating.

(Lufthansa and Air France-KLM had reportedly expressed interest in a 1,000 seat version, which is a lot of middle seats!)

TheA380-900 is essentially a stretched version of the A380-800, measuring 79.4m from tip to tail -- 6.4m (the length of a shipping container) more than today's A380.

Airbus executive vice president Tom Williams says that expanding the already huge A380-800 to even larger variants was the plan from the start.

“I lead the team that designed the wings of the A380, and (when she first saw the models) even my good lady wife was quick to point out that the wings are very big in comparison to the fuselage” Williams told Australian Business Traveller earlier this year.

“The wings are in fact designed for a much larger airplane, so we have the capability of going to a bigger fuselage – we can stretch the fuselage very easily.”

""And we have airlines today who tell us they love the A380 but it’s too small! Now it’s not an engineering issue – we can make it bigger – it’s more a question of what would be a good business case and where the market for this is.""

These supersized aircraft are central to Airbus' belief that the global travel market will settle on ""mega-hubs"" for long-haul travel – each of which will cater to more than 10,000 passengers per day – with other destinations being reached by transfers.

And according to Airbus, those mega-hubs will demand a mega-sized A380 to provide enough seats.

High-end negotiator: How did she get there? - Gulf News,"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9oaWdoLWVuZC1uZWdvdGlhdG9yLWhvdy1kaWQtc2hlLWdldC10aGVyZS0xLjEwODA4MzTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Name Celine Bouas

Age 34

Nationality French

Job Celine is a sales contracts director for Airbus, meaning she negotiates the sale

of Airbus aircraft to airlines. When she isn’t writing up billion-dollar deals (literally), she

is flying all over the world meeting high-flying airline execs.

I followed my passion...

“I’ve always been interested in aviation and space travel. When I was ten years old, I won a trip on Airbus’ first A320. I was fascinated by the aviation industry from then on. I didn’t want to be an engineer though, so at university I studied air and space law and finance instead. After university, I had the choice to work in the industry, or to earn a lot more money working as a lawyer. My dad said, ‘It’s not about the money. It’s about doing a job you are passionate about.’ And he was right. A lot of people in my industry are as passionate as I am. I’d say 80 per cent of us are verging on being geeks.”

I’m a woman in a man’s world...

“Sometimes I find myself in environments that are not comfortable for women. Other times there’s an awkward question mark on everyone’s faces when I walk into a room and I know I have to say something smart quickly so they start listening to what I say, rather than looking at who I am. I call this ‘the power of knowledge’ – if you know your stuff, they’ll forget who you are.”

To do my job...

“In my line of work, you need to have a lot of energy – and you need to be flexible and innovative, as each deal is different. You also need to have a high level of ethics, determination and strength. And if you’re married, or engaged, having an understanding partner is essential.”



It’s high stress, but high reward...

“I don’t think of the price tag of the deal when I’m in the middle of a negotiation. But when I’m lying awake at night, thinking of the huge loss to the company if I make a mistake, it hits me. But the moment the deal is signed, I feel so excited and so proud. Then there’s a big celebration and it’s in the papers and there’s so much hype... it feels like you’ve just finished your final university exams. I love that feeling.”

My advice to others would be...

“Know everything there is to know about your profession so you can add value to a conversation. If I want people to trust my opinion professionally, I need to know what I am talking about. I also think it’s very important to know the priorities of your manager. If you can help your boss achieve their goals, it will reflect well on you.”

I take inspiration from...

“Many pilots from the early years of aviation, for their courage, sense of adventure and dreams. As for a living role model, I would say Christine Lagarde, who heads up the International Monetary Fund. She is a French woman who really has made a career in a man’s world – in the world of French governmental politics. She achieved this through her determination and her competencies, but she stayed feminine and she is the mother of two children. In French we say, ‘Chapeau!’, which means, ‘Hats off to her!’”

Job joys

“I love the common passion I share with my colleagues. I’ve seen adults crying when one of their satellites is launched into space. I always think it must be the best industry ever.”



“I love the travelling. I thought I would eventually get bored of it, but I enjoy meeting people from all over the world and being inspired by them.”



“I find the intellectual side of putting a deal together exciting. The creation and the strategy... the more complex, the better.”

Work woes

“The feeling that you are taking a big risk without a safety net. Sometimes I wake up in the morning with a scared feeling in my stomach – but, at the same time, you need the adrenaline as that powers you through the intense negotiating period.”



“After closing a deal, the admin of drafting it up is a low point for me.” “Filling in my expenses sheet after a business trip away.”"

Part of the bill was for hotel accommodation and “catering” in Montreal and Berlin for the eight Canadian public employees (two military flight crew members and six Montreal police officers) who flew to Germany and returned with a ninth Canadian, the aforementioned Magnotta. Those expenses are not wildly unreasonable, although the $2,000 bill for “catering” in Berlin works out to $250 per Canadian public employee—a little steep for dinner and breakfast when you consider they were in Berlin for 12 hours. Maybe box lunches for the return flight were thrown in by the caterers as well. Who knows.

The hospitality expenses are mere chicken feed, however, compared to the $370,570 transportation bill taxpayers are apparently being dinged with for the expedition.

A look at the hourly price tag:

According to federal documents obtained by the Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act, that $370,570 total is based on an estimated operating hourly rate of $15,505 assessed by the Royal Canadian Air Force for 23.9 hours of flight time logged by the Airbus CC-150 Polaris aircraft employed in the venture.

Now, that seems awfully high to me for a round trip across the Atlantic. I’ll be making the same journey in less than a week for somewhere closer to $400 return (when you knock off taxes). It just doesn’t make sense that it would cost almost 1,000 times as much to fly Luka Magnotta across the same body of water.

At the time arrangements were being made to extradite Magnotta, the Globe and Mail quoted a Montreal police spokeswoman saying, “We made checks and there was no interest from commercial airlines.”

Apparently the necessity to clear out “a complete section” of a commercial airliner to accommodate the accused killer and his guards was just too much to contemplate. (Not naming any particular Canadian airline, but I’ve been on trans-Atlantic flights where the entire business-class compartment could be freed up by moving two or three people up to first class.)

But even if a regular commercial flight was out, why the gargantuan leap to a military Airbus at the cost of $15,505 an hour?

According to the documents CP unearthed, the request for military help came from Public Safety Canada, the federal government’s catchall law enforcement department headed by Minister Vic Toews.

Did Public Safety ever consider renting private aircraft instead?

Just to put my fevered mind at rest, I checked how much that would have cost for the same flight earlier today.

There are plenty of private jet charters out there, but the one I used was PrivateFly, a British company that acts as a clearinghouse for 7,000 charter aircraft worldwide and says it can arrange “the best available private aircraft at the most competitive, transparent market price” within 90 minutes.

Looking through the list of long-range jets offered by PrivateFly, I settled on a Gulfstream 350, which, the website states, “has the ability to carry 8 passengers, travel 3800 nautical miles at Mach 0.8 and cruise at 45,000 feet. It can handle domestic jaunts and transcontinental flights with equal ease.”

The Gulfstream 350 was actually built to accommodate 13 passengers, but PrivateFly’s version obviously gives you a little more legroom — an important feature if you’re wearing manacles and legirons, I would think.

Montreal to Berlin is within the Gulfstream 350’s range on a tank of gas and its 410-knot speed (that’s about 758 km an hour) would make it an eight-hour flight, give or take an hour (depending on weather and headwinds).

And the price?

According to Private Fly, the average cost is $7,030 per flying hour.

That’s a big step back from $15,505 an hour.

I’m sure there are add-ons and other costs to factor in, but nothing that would come close to doubling the cost of the charter.

Flying hours:

Another puzzling question are the flying hours that are being billed to Canadian taxpayers on account of the military Airbus.

Even if you want to make the flight time between Berlin and Montreal 10 hours each way just to be on the safe side, you’re talking a $140,000 bill—not a $370,000 bill. (Just imagine the police overtime that could be paid with that extra $230,000!)

The 23.9 hours of flying time billed by the RCAF for its Airbus included flight time from Cold Lake, Alberta, to Montreal before the trans-Atlantic hop and from Montreal to Trenton, Ontario, after the delivery, according to the documents obtained by CP.

Now, the RCAF’s five converted Airbus transports—including the VIP version used to extradite Magnotta—are operated by 437 Squadron based at CFB Trenton. So I’m not really sure why the Department of National Defence would get to charge for the Cold Lake-Montreal leg of the journey when the aircraft’s home base is within spitting distance of Montreal (in aviation terms).

Picking up the bill:

And who exactly will pay for all this? It will be interesting to see.

The parties involved seem to be Service de police de la Ville de Montreal (which headed the murder investigation and sent six members of its force to Berlin to get Magnotta), Surete de Quebec (because they were involved in the overall Magnotta investigation and fugitive hunt), the RCMP (because Magnotta is charged with mailing body parts and criminally harassing Stephen Harper and other Members of Parliament), Public Safety Canada, the Department of National Defence and the Attorney General of Canada (because he is responsible for international extraditions, according to the Extradition Act of 1999).

My suspicion is that, after a certain amount of horse trading, Harper will tell the various federal departments involved to each pick up a share of the transportation tab, while the Montreal police will foot the bill for the six officers’ overtime and victualing in Berlin.

If there’s one bright spot in all this—apart from the important fact that Luka Magnotta is back in a Canadian jail cell and preparing for trial in a few months—it’s that the Canadian military is apparently learning how to pay for itself.

It’s too much to think the forces will actually become a profit centre, but profit margin now seems to be as relevant as mission when it comes to strategic planning.

Can the day of the $748 pliers (U.S. Air Force) and the $640 toilet seat (U.S. Navy) be far away for the RCAF and Royal Canadian Navy?"

Airbus increasing industrial cooperation in South Africa; partnering on titanium manufacturing process - defenceWeb,"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNld2ViLmNvLnphL2luZHVzdHJ5L2luZHVzdHJ5LWluZHVzdHJ5L2FpcmJ1cy1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY29vcGVyYXRpb24taW4tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLXBhcnRuZXJpbmctb24tdGl0YW5pdW0tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1wcm9jZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and Aerosud have agree to partner on a research project to test the application of titanium powder-based Additive layer Manufacturing (ALM) for the fabrication of large and complex aerospace components. ALM promises to be faster and cheaper than conventional manufacturing processes.

The initiative is another example of Airbus’s industrial partnerships with local South African industry. The titanium ALM project is the latest in a series of Airbus Research and Technology partnerships established under a 2006 agreement with the Department of Science and Technology.

It will see Airbus, supported by EADS Innovation Works, cooperating with South African aerostructures manufacturer Aerosud and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR’s) National Laser Centre (NLC). Together, they will test and evaluate this new approach as it is applied to producing larger-scale titanium parts at high speed by using the NLC’s expertise in high-powered lasers and laser-based manufacturing expertise.

If successful, the project could have significant cost and environmental efficiency ramifications for airlines, aircraft operators, the aerospace and other manufacturing industries in addition to boosting South Africa’s minerals beneficiation strategy, Airbus said.

“ALM involves forming an object from powder, which is arranged in layers and fused by high-speed lasers. It is a process completely devoid of bulk machining, cutting and welding thereby minimizing waste and optimizing the manufacturing process. It’s like printing in 3D,” explained the CSIR’s Hardus Greyling, project coordinator of project Aeroswift at the CSIR.

Aerosud and the CSIR NLC have been developing the innovative ALM approach under the Department of Science & Technology-funded Aeroswift project. Initial proof-of-concept studies were carried out a few months ago and based on the results a decision was made to construct a full scale prototype system to demonstrate the technology. This technology will allow the production of large geometrically complex items. “Typically focusing on parts which are prohibitively expensive or impossible to make using traditional methods,” said Aerosud Managing Director, Dr Paul Potgieter.

“SA is the second-largest supplier of (titanium) mineral ore…but adds little value to that before export,” Deputy Science and Technology Minister Derek Hanekom said at the launch of project Aeroswift in January this year. “The CSIR has developed a novel process whereby titanium metal powder can be produced from our abundant mineral resource. Currently the primary titanium process is being commercialised and a pilot plant will be built during the year.”

The heart of Aeroswift is the NLC’s new 5 kW IPG single-fibre diode laser. The CSIR NLC has already, in its proof of concept trials, achieved production speeds 8.3 times greater than currently available commercial selective laser melting machines. The proof of concept trials involved the production of small parts, no longer than 50 cm. With Aeroswift, the aim is to produce parts as big as 2 x 0.5 metres

“There is no doubt that ALM is changing the small-scale component manufacturing landscape and with Airbus joining the partnership, it will be possible to test and evaluate the manufacturing process on large components for passenger jetliners,” explained Dale King, Airbus Senior Manager International Research & Technology Projects.

“The above-mentioned projects have been supported through research and technology development funding grants of approximately R65 million over the last six years from the Department of Science and Technology” said Beeuwen Gerryts, Chief Director at the Department of Science & Technology. He said he was excited to see the ALM initiative at this stage of development and added that it was an example of the importance of global research and development.

The project is central to South Africa’s national titanium beneficiation strategy, which aims to transform the country from an exporter of raw materials to an exporter of semi-finished or finished goods, which can be sold at a premium compared with the material in its raw state. South Africa has spent R200 million since 2006 on the titanium beneficiation programme, including the ALM project.

Current manufacturing relies on traditional milling and machining where components are cut and carved out of a metal billet, a process that typically sees up to 95 percent of expensive raw material going to waste. In contrast, the ALM technique minimizes material wastage by building up a component from powder, with the optimal amount of material being consumed in the process. Any powder left over can be dusted off and used again. The potential cost savings in raw materials could potentially amount to millions of dollars on every jetliner built. In addition, the weight savings are likely to result in significant cost savings and reduced emissions through lower fuel consumption.

Aerosud expects to turn on the new titanium ALM machine in March 2013, and run it as a pilot plant. Full-scale production will start approximately two years after that. The company is collaborating with Airbus on guiding the manufacturing process for aircraft components – the titanium ALM process is a South African project involving South African funding and South African intellectual property. Components will mostly be used in engines, where heat-resistant titanium is required.

“We’re here in South Africa, we’re committed and we recognise the sills you have here,” said King, affirming Airbus’s commitment to build skills in the country.

Airbus launched its South African R&T programme in 2006 under an agreement with the Department of Science & Technology and the Department of Trade & Industry. Airbus’s South African R&T projects are coordinated through the DTI’s National Aerospace Centre. Airbus has forged partnerships with Stellenbosch University, WITS University, University of Cape Town and various units of the CSIR, working on a variety of projects.

Airbus has a long history of industrial cooperation with South African industry, and considers South Africa to be a strategic industrial partner for its range of commercial aircraft and the Airbus Military A400M airlifter.

Airbus works with three main suppliers in South Africa, Cape Town based Cobham Omnipless, Johannesburg based Denel Aerostructures and Aerosud in Centurion.

Aerosud has steadily taken on responsibility for manufacturing an increasing variety of wing and fuselage items for Airbus. They include avionics-bay racks, flap track cans and wing parts for the entire Airbus single-aisle aircraft family (A318, A319, A320 and A321) and the wing tips, galleys, rigid bulkhead and linings for the cockpit, nose fuselage and cargo hold for the A400M.

Aerosud manufactures A350 track can components for the A350 XWB through a contract awarded by Kansas based Spirit AeroSystems, one of Airbus’ major risk sharing partners on the A350 XWB programme. Aerosud is also contracted produce the CFRP Frame Clips for the centre section of the A350 XWB, which links the composite skins to the frames and stringers. The Frame Clips are the first composite airframe components of any Airbus commercial aircraft to be produced in South Africa.

Cobham provides satellite communication systems for the entire Airbus family of aircraft, including the A380 and the A350 XWB.

Denel-Saab Aerostructures hosts a dedicated A400M Design Engineering centre at its facility opposite O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. It is home to over 50 engineers tasked with the design and integration of complex hybrid assemblies for the new military aircraft. Denel-Saab Aerostructures manufactures the A400M’s top-shells and the wing-fuselage fairing. This fairing is an aerodynamically critical section of the aircraft, measuring 15.5 m long x 7 m wide x 2 m deep, making it the largest single aircraft structural component ever produced in South Africa.

Other South African suppliers for Airbus aircraft include Saab Avitronics (A400M life-time monitoring system) and AAT Composites (buyer-furnished seat components and cabin stowages certified for use in all Airbus products).

Airbus was also instrumental in the establishment of Africa NDT, a Pretoria-based non-destructive testing centre serving South Africa’s aerospace community. Africa NDT is jointly owned by NDT Expert, a Toulouse based subsidiary of Airbus’ parent, EADS, France’s industrial standards agency, Bureau Veritas and Aerosud."

The Airbus A350 is a family of long-range, wide-body jet airliners under development by European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The A350 will be the first Airbus with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. It will carry 250 to 350 passengers in three-class seating, depending on variant. The A350 was born as an A330-derived minimum-changed competitor to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the larger Boeing 777, but was unanimously rejected by prospective customers. Airbus was forced to redesign the initial proposal, but airlines voiced support for a complete overhaul. The eventual proposal incorporates major changes, which Airbus says will be more fuel-efficient, with up to 8% lower operating cost than the Boeing 787. The redesigned A350 was marketed by Airbus as the A350 XWB, where the XWB stands for Extra Wide Body. The launch customer for the A350 is Qatar Airways, which ordered 80 aircraft across the three variants. Development costs are projected to be US$15 billion. The airliner is scheduled to enter airline service during the second half of 2014. As of 20 January 2012, 561 orders had been placed for the new aircraft ."

The aircraft exhibited on static and flying display at the ILA Berlin Air Show is the flight test aircraft for CFM engines and will also be delivered to AirAsia in 2013. In 2009 Airbus launched a new blended winglet design which the company called a ""sharklet"", designed to enhance the payload-range performance of the A320 Family. Offered as a retrofit option, sharklets are expected to result in a reduced fuel burn of at least 3.5 percent over longer sectors, corresponding to an annual CO2 reduction of around 700 tons per aircraft. The A320 will be the first model fitted with sharklets, which became available in 2012. ""The A320 has played a key role in our success, enabling us to offer our passengers the lowest fares possible and completely redefine short haul travel in Asia.” said Tony Fernandes, AirAsia Group CEO. “Now we are looking forward to become the first airline in the world to start operating this most fuel-efficient aircraft.”"
