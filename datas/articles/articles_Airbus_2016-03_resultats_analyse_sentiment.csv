Pioneering bionic 3D printing - Airbus,"Thu, 03 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLXBpb25lZXJpbmctYmlvbmljLTNkLXByaW50aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Breakthrough for future Airbus A320

Autodesk and Airbus have unveiled the world’s largest 3D printed airplane cabin component: a ‘bionic partition’ to separate the passenger cabin from the galley. The innovative design mimics the organic cellular structure and bone growth found in living organisms.



For passengers, it’s a distinctly unremarkable part of a plane’s interior, but for aircraft manufacturers it’s one of many significant pieces in a major engineering puzzle to minimise weight, while retaining great design and infrastructure safety.

Fixed between the passenger seating area and plane’s galley, this particular partition is a dividing wall that in some seating configurations will be used to support the jumpseats used by cabin crews during takeoff and landing. As such, it needs to be strong, which, with traditional materials and manufacturing processes, makes it heavy and bulky.

The new bionic partition’s structure represents a radical departure in that it has dispensed with much of the material, weight and bulk inherent to traditional design. Together, Autodesk and Airbus have harnessed the expertise of 3D printing experts of APWorks, an Airbus subsidiary, in a design collaboration with experts on generative design from TheLiving, an Autodesk Studio.

A disruptive potential

The result of the project creates sounded expectactions: a partition that is structurally very strong but also lightweight, weighing 45% (30 kg) less than current designs. This makes the bionic partition a groundbreaking development for a sector in which less weight equals less fuel consumption.

When applied to the entire cabin and to the current backlog of A320 planes, Airbus estimates that the new design approach could save up to 465,000 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.

APWorks – Home of groundbreaking materials

The new bionic partition uses Scalmalloy®, a second-generation aluminium-magnesium-scandium alloy created by APWorks, an Airbus subsidiary.



An Engineer at Airbus Innovations in Filton removes excess powder from a part made by Additive Layer Manufacturing (3D printing). 3D printing has many advantages for example weight saving and new design flexibility.

Scalmalloy®

Lightweight, high-strength material

APWorks makes proven aerospace technologies and innovations accessible to other industries, focusing on modern production processes such as additive layer manufacturing and advanced materials.

One of these groundbreaking materials is Scalmalloy®. Specifically designed for use in 3D printing, it offers outstanding mechanical properties, meaning it can undergo significant stress and stretching before breaking. This is the first time it has been used on a large scale inside an aircraft component.

The rise of generative design

A key element in the creation of the new bionic partition is the rapid evolution in generative design. This capitalises on the power of cloud computing to generate thousands of design alternatives that meet specific goals and constraints.

Generative design can explore new solutions that even experienced designers might not have considered, while improving design quality and performance. Because the designs are nearly impossible to manufacture using traditional methods, additive manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are critical to generative design’s success.



Future of aerospace design and manufacturing

Airbus’ titanium cabin bracket was produced with the help of 3D metal printing. The bionic component weighs 30 percent less than the traditionally milled piece.

The combination of rapidly improving 3D printing with nature’s secrets is bound to open up new industrial horizons. Airbus' Bionic Network with partner universities is already developing several aviation-applicable ideas.



Airbus' bionic 3D printing

Building on a network of universities

The field of bionics, exploring the mechanics and structures of the natural world and investigating their potential applications in modern technology, has become a significant focus for Airbus. It has created a Bionics Network that connects its 3D printing experts to academic institutions at the forefront of research in the bionics field.

“It isn’t as simple as copying nature,” explains Peter Sander of Emerging Technologies and Concepts at Airbus. “Successful bionics depends on establishing a deep understanding of natural materials and then working out how to apply that knowledge in the industrial world.”

Airbus' capacity to use metal powders of high quality and strength is increasing. “These technologies will ultimately revolutionise the way we design and build aircraft, enabling improvements in fuel efficiency, passenger comfort and a drastic reduction in the environmental footprint of air transport overall,” highlights Sander.

Taking 3D metal printing to the next level

Proof of these new technologies is a method called selective laser melting, through which thin layers of melted metal are put on top of each other. The technique allows the use of common industrial alloys, like steel or titanium in 3D printing, producing durable components with great accuracy and precision.

Partnering with Professor Claus Emmelmann, from Hamburg’s Technical University, and selective laser melting expert Frank Herzog, Peter Sander has now brought this technology to Airbus. To demonstrate its potential, the team printed a bionic titanium bracket for the A350 XWB.

This innovative collaboration project was nominated for the 2015 German Future Awards (Deutscher Zukunftspreis) and Airbus plans to launch series production using this 3D printing approach in 2016.

Flying All 3 Big Gulf Carrier Airbus A380s in First Class on a Single Trip - View from the Wing,"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9mbHlpbmctYWxsLTMtYmlnLWd1bGYtY2Fycmllci1haXJidXMtYTM4MHMtaW4tZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mtb24tYS1zaW5nbGUtdHJpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having wrapped up the British Airways first and business class trip report from my long weekend at Paris staying at the Park Hyatt Vendome, I’m about to commence on my next report: flying all 3 of the major Gulf carriers in first class on their Airbus A380s.

The funny thing is I didn’t even set out to do that, but wound up in Airbus A380 First Class on Emirates, Qatar, and Etihad using miles. But it would be the Emirates onboard shower spa and all-around bling, Qatar — an airline I hadn’t yet flown, and a visit to their brand new first class lounge in Doha, and the single best first class product in the sky the Etihad First Apartment.

I wanted to visit Bangkok for a few days largely for the street food and also to have some new suits made.

And I’ve had visiting the Museum of Islamic Art on my mental list of things I’d really like to do for quite some time. I had a week where it was convenient to travel.

I also had a whole series of reservations I had made in Etihad first class for their New York JFK – Abu Dhabi flight that started operating as the Airbus A380 (and thus offering the new First Apartment) in late November. When the switch was first announced seats were wide open for award booking.

The First Apartment of course is on the upper deck of Etihad’s A380. Upstairs Emirates has 14 suites, configured four-across. Etihad has 9 suites and the Residence, with a two-across configuration. It’s a single aisle on the upper deck of the superjumbo with seats that are large enough you can walk around inside your suite even when you’re in bed mode.

I decided to use one of the Abu Dhabi – New York JFK awards I had booked (for 90,000 American AAdvantage miles + $39.30 taxes per person).

For the outbound I booked an Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan award on Emirates for Houston – Dubai – Bangkok in first class (100,000 miles + $19.10 taxes per person). I wound up somewhat worried when Emirates assigned their new high density Airbus A380 without a first class cabin to fly to Bangkok, but it didn’t affect my flight.

I then decided to book Bangkok – Doha on Qatar in first class, one of the few routes with an A380 and thus with first class (45,000 miles + $22.35 taxes apiece). First class awards are highly available on the route.

Incidentally Qatar first class passengers have access to the Thai Airways first class lounge in Bangkok. But it turns out the gate they use is nowhere near the first class lounge, and there’s a tiny satellite first lounge much nearer that I had never been to. And it was pretty strange.

At the time I set up the award back in the fall the only segment I had difficulty with was Doha – Abu Dhabi, so I kept checking and a month or so later seats opened up on Etihad and I called to add the flight. Then a month after that space opened up on Qatar, so I decided to switch: Qatar offered a wide body for the short one hour flight, but more importantly codes the intra-Middle East segments as first class meaning I’d have access to the brand new al Safwa lounge.

For hotels I settled on the St. Regis Bangkok for three nights which was selling suites for about $200.

And I stayed two nights at the W Doha which had cash and points available (6000 points and $110 per night). The W Doha is only one of two W’s I know of with a club lounge (the other being Guangzhou).

It was a fantastic trip, I got to see some things I hadn’t seen before and enjoy some familiar things. I tried new travel products, and learned some tips and tricks about those products along the way. So I look forward to sharing it with you.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
Airbus Ventures Takes Off by Going Local - Institutional Investor,"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3RpdHV0aW9uYWxpbnZlc3Rvci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yYnN4dXpoMXJhajBhem42OWxpNGcvcG9ydGZvbGlvL2FpcmJ1cy12ZW50dXJlcy10YWtlcy1vZmYtYnktZ29pbmctbG9jYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"John (Jay) Rogers Jr., CEO and co-founder of Phoenix-based start-up Local Motors, was sitting in the desert in 2004 as a Marine on his last tour in Iraq when he decided he wanted to go home and create a new kind of car company — one that would build a new kind of vehicle. “I was thinking about how much oil we were pulling out of the ground,” he says. “I thought, if we can make cars differently, we can get off the oil habit. We can change the world through something that I love, which is the vehicle.”

Rogers developed a vision of doing everything about cars differently. He didn’t want to concentrate solely on the power train, a frequent focus of innovative efforts. Instead, he wanted to remake the sensors, the materials, safety, comfort, usability — all of it. He decided he would start by rethinking how vehicles get made in the first place.

That desire to approach manufacturing from a brand-new direction is what makes Local Motors, the start-up Rogers would go on to found in 2007, a perfect fit as the first portfolio company of Airbus Group Ventures, the new venture capital arm of the Netherlands-based aerospace behemoth. Airbus Group CEO Thomas Enders has committed $150 million to the venture arm’s first fund and installed Tim Dombrowski, formerly a partner at $4.2 billion Silicon Valley VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, as its head. Enders’s charge to Dombrowski: Find the technologies and start-ups that are poised to disrupt the aerospace industry.

“What happens in research and development organizations is typically incremental innovation on top of existing products,” says Dombrowski, who spent much of his early career in design engineering and program management focused on commercial aircraft, defense, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle programs at Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Sikorsky and United Technologies. “A real disruption might not happen there; that’s what’s great about what [Airbus] is doing.”

Dombrowski is focusing on early-stage growth investments, adding that he’s looking into angel and seed investments too. “That [earlier stage] would be a very small segment of what we want to do, but there are too many things that are interesting there to pass them up,” he says. Although Dombrowski won’t comment specifically on how much the firm plans to invest in each company or how many investments its first fund intends to make, he says he wants to make sure it has enough reserves set aside for a possible follow-on round in each of the start-ups in which it invests.

The Airbus Ventures chief first heard about Local Motors while doing research around advanced manufacturing, an area that includes 3-D printing. “Local Motors kept popping up,” Dombrowski says. As he learned more about the company, he found he was most interested in its embrace of crowdsourced engineering to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. A “recovering engineer,” as he describes himself, the former HP Software and Opsware executive says he believes the mentality Local Motors models — loosening the tight, secretive grip on intellectual property and soliciting feedback from engineers outside of the company in the interest of bringing good ideas to market quickly — could be game-changing. Given that Airbus Group CEO Enders is eager to speed up the process by which his 136,000-employee organization brings new innovations to market, the investment makes sense.

Local Motors’ Rogers first heard about crowdsourcing through a company called Threadless, which sells T-shirts printed with designs submitted by independent artists. The model made him curious: What would happen if a vehicle company posed a challenge to engineers sitting at home on their computers — say, how to create a 3-D-printed automobile — and crowdsourced possible solutions? Having worked for a medical device manufacturer in China briefly before joining the Marines, Rogers also wondered why the automotive industry remained so steeped in mass manufacturing, when new technologies, like 3-D printing, made possible distributed microfactories (specialized facilities focused on prototyping and producing a small batch of products at a rapid pace).

Rogers created Local Motors as a platform that would incorporate both crowdsourcing and distributed microfactories — thereby, he hoped, courting disruption within sea, land and air vehicles, as well as appliances. Local Motors has partnered with General Electric Co., for example, to source ideas online from engineers to improve upon existing GE products and prototype new ideas. The most popular innovations will be built and tested in a new microfactory. Local Motors has also established a commercial partnership with Airbus — in a deal separate from the venture investment — to help develop the aerospace company’s drones using the same process.

The investment from Airbus Ventures will likely be used by Local Motors to develop a new microfactory in Germany and laboratories that bring together engineers to collaborate both online and in person. Dombrowski says his team — which includes himself and two other investment partners —will play a close advisory role with Local Motors, and board seats are still being discussed.

As he searches for Airbus Ventures’ next investment, Dombrowski is both bowed and energized by the scope of his mandate, which includes any technology or system that could prove accretive to any of the products within Airbus Group. Commercial aircraft is a particular area of interest — given that it represents 70 percent of Airbus’s revenue — but military aircraft, helicopters, launch vehicles, rockets, unmanned air vehicles (or drones) and satellites are also promising. Technology that touches on any of those areas could include engines of all kinds, avionics, aircraft software systems, sensors to feed into the Internet of Things, analytics to analyze those data, materials like aluminum composites and even in-flight entertainment. Dombrowski says he’s happy to have been granted full independence from Airbus, which means he can make investment decisions quickly, without reporting to any higher-ups within the company.

“There’s no more exciting time to be starting a venture business,” says Dombrowski, noting that private markets are softening. “This is going to be good for us.”

My First Airbus A350 Flight – On TAM Airlines - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy9maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1mbGlnaHQtdGFtLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recently, I had the opportunity to fly on my first Airbus A350 and I was excited. It was on TAM Airlines from Miami (MIA) to Sao Paulo (GRU), which is an eight-hour flight — enough time for me to put it to the test. It was also special, because this was the first international commercial flight for the TAM A350 (when it flew to MIA).

Over two and a half days, I would fly about 14,000 miles and stay in Brazil for one night to take this flight. When I did something very similar (minus the sweet A350) back in November 2014, I thought I would never do something like it again. But when invited, there wasn’t a moment of hesitation. The ability to fly on my first A350 — on TAM? Yes please!

Going into it, my big question was, “is the A350 better than the Boeing 787 and/or the 777?” In the end, the answer to that question was not so easy.

The TAM product can be a little confusing, since LAN and TAM are in the process of merging (to be called LATAM), but are operating independently for now. Following the merger, both airlines will feature the same interior product. This new look has already made it to LAN’s 787-9s, and now the TAM A350. The new interior design will slowly make its way to both airlines’ international fleet, and there will be another unified product for domestic aircraft.

Although the new interiors have begun rolling out, the world has not yet seen the new LATAM livery (although we got our first clue on a 787). The airline has not said when this new livery will be revealed, but they earlier stated that it will be seen on the fourth A350, which should be delivered in June. However, that might not be the first aircraft sporting new livery. It is likely that the new LATAM will make a big deal of the reveal, so it will be hard to miss. But for now, my A350 wore the standard TAM livery — and I have to say it looks good on that plane!

I had flown from Seattle to Miami (via Atlanta) and had a three-hour layover before the A350 was scheduled to depart. As the six of us in the press group waited to board early (to take photos of the empty cabin), we saw people with neon vests sitting in the flight deck — this was not a good sign. After waiting just outside the gate door for a while, we were informed that there would be a mechanical delay. We headed back to the lounge, hopeful things would work out quickly.

Due to crew rest rules, and there being no spare TAM A350 pilots in Miami, we knew the plane needed to be boarding by 2:00 am or the flight would have to be cancelled and rescheduled. At about 10 minutes before the cutoff, a TAM airport agent entered the lounge. I was hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. Luckily, we were told that we could board.

It turns out that there was an indicator light that was on, and we couldn’t depart until it was handled. Not a huge deal, more of a pain, and these things happen — either way I was happy to get on board.

I was impressed upon walking into the A350’s cabin — the lighting and colors were very welcoming and I almost felt at home.

TAM’s A350s have 30 Premium Business Class seats in a 2-2-2 layout, with 74″ seat pitch (their 777s currently are 2-3-2). The economy cabin has 318 seats in a 3-3-3 configuration, with 31″ of seat pitch. Of course it would be better if every seat had aisle access, but many airlines still are not offering it. I asked why this decision was made and TAM stated, “During the seat selection for our Premium Business Class, passenger experience and technical variables were taken into consideration. Regarding passenger experience, a 2-2-2 layout offers the benefit of a comfortable bed, with a comfortable width, that allows for a restful experience on long and overnight flights.” They also pointed out that this layout is beneficial to interact with those you might be traveling with.

As far as 2-2-2 layouts are concerned — this became my favorite, and I actually would rather fly in this product than some 1-2-1 setups I have flown.

Although I enjoyed the LATAM cabin, I was also interested in seeing how I felt about the A350 itself. I noticed that the walls were flatter and more upright, giving it more a sense of being on the ground than in the air. The windows are quite large and offer plenty of viewing space and natural light. The only downside is the outside of the window and the inside plastic are about 2″ apart. It might improve sound and make people feel removed from the flight experience a bit, but makes it harder to take good photos — but not impossible.

Whereas the Boeing 787 has the electronic-dimming windows, the A350 rocks the old-school sunshades (although Qatar made theirs pretty cool). After flying the 787 quite a bit, I have to say there are times that I enjoy the electronic windows (when I want to see outside) and other times that I do not (when I want control over my window or I am trying to sleep).

Like the 787, I enjoyed the different lighting options and their ability to slowly transition from one cycle to the next (boarding, take off, meal, sleep, wake up time, and landing).

We had some time before we would push back, so I took a tour of the rest of the plane, including economy, the rear crew rest area, and of course the flight deck. Being my first time on the A350, I haven’t see the flight deck in person. I was greeted by huge displays, great sight lines outside, and plenty of space to move around (also a USB plug — cool).

As I made my way back to my seat, I couldn’t help but notice how empty the plane was — I was told that there were only about 50 passengers. This meant everyone would have more than enough room and it felt VIP.

I got situated at my seat and we started to push back. I was anxiously waiting for those sweet Trent XWB engines to start up. The time came and their sound whirling up was music to my ears.

We started to move forward on our own power and headed to the runway. After lining up, I waited in anticipation for the engines to go full throttle. Although quiet, their sound was enjoyable and I got goosebumps as we rocketed forward and lifted off.

We ascended until hitting our cruise altitude of about 40,000 feet — higher than most airliners. While we climbed, I started to explore the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system.

There is an easily accessible universal power outlet and USB port under the armrest (there is a second USB port by the screen). In front of the seat is a 19″ touchscreen (Panasonic eX3) and a remote in the armrest to control it. The remote is better than TAM’s older IFE, but it was still hard to navigate the system. I found it much easier to use the touchscreen, however it was too far away (even for my long arms) and required me to lean out of my seat. There were a few times I got frustrated enough to get up and just touch the screen. The resolution was crisp and the sound from the TAM headphones provided a great movie viewing experience.

The movie and TV options were quite diverse, but with my recent flying and binging a bit on Netflix, I had a hard time finding something I was excited to watch (even more so on my flight home). One unique aspect was each movie showed an IMDB rating — steering me clear of bad movies.

While I started watching a movie, meal service began. The main choice was between three entrees: chicken, fish, or steak.

BONUS: Touring TAM’s Maintenance Operations Center in Brazil

I went with the steak — or as they described it: “Grilled steak with rustic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.” I have to say I was quite disappointed — it was dry and tough. I would assume it was that bad since it had to sit on the ground for an additional three hours. On my flight home, I also ordered the steak and it was better, but not great. Although the sides (and bread) on both of my flights were quite good.

When I was done with my steak, I decided to skip desert (ice cream or caramel flan) and prepare for sleep.

Sleep. Finally. I had gotten up at 5:00 am PDT and it was about 3:30 am EDT by the time I had a chance to sleep on the lie-flat seat. One of the friendly flight attendants offered to make my bed and I accepted. TAM is testing out mattress pads that go on top of the seat and I am a strong supporter. Not only does the mattress pad provide more cushioning, it keeps you from lying in other peoples’ sweat.

TAM does not provide any PJs, but I had a nice collection at home. I decided to bring pair of my own (BYOPJs) and decided on Qatar Airways. Why? Because both airlines are oneworld partners and figured that made sense (and I didn’t want to insult my hosts and yes, I think I am funny).

My five hours of rest were great. Even with a seat between me and the aisle, I felt very isolated and away from other people in the cabin (much more so than their previous product). The big downside was that the bed wasn’t quite long enough for me. The stats show the bed at 74″, but at 6’1″ (73″), my feet and head touched each end of the seat. If I slept a bit diagonal or had my knees a little bent it was fine. Overall, the bed was roomy (width-wise) and the pillow and blanket were cozy, so I ended up with some great sleep.

When I woke up, I was a bit surprised — my nose felt very dry — weird. I had thought that the A350 had the same “more humidity” option that the Boeing 787. Turns out, that is not always the case.

All Airbus A350s provide the lower cabin altitude (6,000 feet), but the humidified air is not standard — something that TAM opted not to get. Sure, the down sides are the up front costs, the expenditures related to the additional weight of flying the equipment, and repair costs. But do those outweigh the benefits?

I wish that Airbus did not make this an option. Sure, more costs, but then passengers would become more brand-loyal to the A350 — knowing each one offers the additional humidity. I also wish that TAM saw the cost benefit of choosing this option. I know flying the 787 (with humidified air) back-to-back with a 777 or 767 (as I previously did with LAN), there is a noticeable difference. Oh well.

Then it was time to wake up. Earlier in the flight, I filled out a menu form to choose what I wanted to eat for breakfast — I haven’t seen that before and thought it was pretty smart. There were lots of choices and I went with some eggs, a croissant, and potatoes. It was better than my dinner, but still below other business class food on other airlines I have tried. The red glasses for water and juice were a nice touch.

I have only visited Sao Paulo once before. I forgot how the city is so huge and spread out — very impressive. We made up some time in the air, but still arrived quite late. Once we cleared customs, we had lunch, visited TAM’s flight attendant training academy, had dinner, and returned to the hotel to sleep. Almost seven hours later, I was back in the lobby and started my 22-hour journey home (on a 777-300ER).

Back to the question comparing the Airbus A350 to the 787 and 777. I like the A350… I really do. However, it is hard for me to do a direct comparison, since I have only flown on one Airbus A350 on one airline. I have had much more experience flying the 787 and 777 on different airlines.

BONUS: Flight Review of TAM’s Business Class on a Boeing 777-300ER

Pooling all my experiences together, all things being equal, I would choose an Airbus A350 over the Boeing 777. That says a lot — I love the 777. Even flying on a brand-new, well configured 777, the A350 just feels newer, more fresh (and not just talking about the product, but the basic interior look). The large windows, high ceiling, reduction of turbulence, and LED lighting put it in the lead (an airline with the optional extra humidity would just lock this in more).

Determining a winner between the 787 and A350 isn’t as obvious for me. Since the A350 is wider than the 787, the Airbus feels more spacious. If an airline opted for the higher humidity cabin, I think the A350 would be my choice. Even without, I think for now (knowing there is a “newness” factor), I would choose to fly on the A350 over the 787. Once the A350 becomes more common, I am not sure which aircraft will become my favorite. I will need to fly more A350s (a task that I am willing to take on).

If you have flown the 787, 777, and A350 give me your thoughts on the three in the comments. I am interested to see how others compare the three.

Was it worth flying 14,000 miles for one night in Sao Paulo? Absolutely! The TAM and Airbus A350 combination is very strong and made the jetlag all worth it. Although TAM has cut “The Magic Red Carpet,” from the side of the A350 (there’s another logo there, aircraft specific), they still offer the red carpet service. I am excited to see how the new LATAM brand grows and their products unify and improve.

Airbus Gauges Interest in a New 400-Seat Twin-Engine Jetliner - Fortune,"Fri, 04 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy8wNC9haXJidXMtd2VpZ2hzLW5ldy00MDAtc2VhdC1qZXRsaW5lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Boeing’s 777-9 enters service toward the end of this decade, the 406-seater will be the largest offering in the popular twin-engine, wide-body jet category. Not to be outgunned by its American rival, European plane-maker Airbus is now shopping around its own 400-seat twin-engine jetliner, escalating an ongoing competition to build the world’s biggest twin-engine commercial jet.

Airbus (EADSY) is reportedly seeking airliner support for a new variant of its A350 wide-body with extended seating capacity and better seat mile economics than the 777-9, an Airbus sales rep tells Reuters. The 777-9 already proved itself a commercial success for Boeing (BA), notching more than 250 orders since 2013 from airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Cathay Pacific, and Qatar Airways.

Dubbed the A350-8000 for now, the new Airbus jet would target airlines that need high-capacity, long-range aircraft but not necessarily require the same high-performance characteristics that have made the 777-9 so popular with Middle Eastern airlines. (The Gulf region can be hard on an airliner.) Airbus’s current A350 variants seat approximately 360 passengers at most, and a higher capacity twin jet would help Airbus compete for customers requiring high-capacity jets but don’t want to make the leap up to Airbus’s four-engine, double-decker A380—currently the world’s largest passenger airliner.

But building a larger airliner isn’t as simple as stretching the fuselage and bolting in some additional seats. Assuming Airbus finds enough airline support to justify pursuing the A350-8000 beyond the drawing board, it will have to convince engine maker Rolls-Royce to develop a new derivative of the engine slated for the A350-1000, currently the largest of the A350 variants. The first flight of the A350-1000 is slated for the second half of this year.

For more about Airbus, watch:

Rolls-Royce may not have the bandwidth or budget to do so, and it could prove an expensive proposition—like half-a-billion dollars expensive, by one estimate. But that investment could be worth it in the long-term. While orders for Airbus’s massive A380 have been far softer than the company anticipated, the market for high-capacity, twin-engine jets is valued at around $1.9 trillion over the next two decades.

The company is expected to provide an update on the A350-8000s future at the Farnborough International Air Show outside of London in July.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8793597221374512}",positive,0.8793597221374512,1
4D printing and digital materials - Airbus,"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLTRkLXByaW50aW5nLWFuZC1kaWdpdGFsLW1hdGVyaWFsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"4D printing: the extra dimension

Airbus is aiming to revolutionise the aerospace industry with a new generation of intelligent materials, partnering with some of the world’s leading researchers.



4D printing: the extra dimension

Cutting-edge technology doesn’t always imply greater complexity. At least that’s what Skylar Tibbits thinks. The Research Scientist at the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT) Department of Architecture is pioneering work on so-called '4D printing', creating dynamic 3D printed materials that can change shape by themselves when confronted with outside forces such as water, movement or a change in temperature.

Shape-shifters

The technique has potential for a wide range of uses, including the aerospace sector, and Tibbits is collaborating with Airbus to develop a special air inlet component.

Today’s nacelle ventilation air inlets are static, so the air flowing through them varies greatly according to the speed of the aircraft. At cruise condition, air flow is much greater, which can adversely affect fuel consumption.

This collaboration with Airbus was born around the company's ProtoSpace facilities, where researchers and engineers develop disruptive concepts and accelerate the pace of innovation.

Thanks to programmable carbon fibre, the new air inlet would adjust itself automatically to control air flow used to cool the engine. This would remove the need for the heavy mechanical system currently performing this task.

‘Responsive’ objects

Airbus has already successfully tested the inlet in a wind tunnel, and the potential is clear, as Christophe Cros, from Airbus’ Emerging Technology and Concept team explains. “Air vehicles have lots of air inlets for ventilation or thermal control that could benefit from this technology. We could also envisage extending the application to movable surfaces or even aircraft cabins to mediate pressure or make them more breathable.”

Digital fabrication – Developing 'industrial Lego'

Together with MIT, Airbus is exploring the use of digital manufacturing in aerospace. This disruptive approach echoes the body's construction of proteins from amino acids to build complex structures.

Digital aerospace structures

While many others are focusing on 3D printing, Neil Gershenfeld has dedicated his research to something called digital fabrication. “It will allow individuals to design and produce tangible objects on demand, wherever and whenever they need them,” claims the Director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms.

On an industrial scale, he compares it to “carbon-fibre Lego” that will help reduce mass and save weight. “Parts will join like snap-together building blocks to give a structure that is lightweight, extremely durable and easy to assemble and reassemble.”

Airbus’ collaboration with MIT

Airbus has signed a deal with MIT to work with Gershefeld on exploring the use of digital fabrication in aerospace. “Currently, everything is so big – you need huge tools to produce large parts and then transport them for assembly,” he says.

“Digital materials could use smaller, interlocking pieces. Rather than building large, monolithic, single-use components, we turn the materials into simple, repeating, functional bits.”

4D printing at MIT: Self-assembling components

The expanding materials were placed strategically on the main structure to produce joints that stretched and folded like a bendy straw when activated by water, forming a broad range of shapes.

In the future, the technique is expected to produce larger structures which can handle more complex transformations, as well as smaller, miniaturised models that can be used in an aircraft's body.

Other successful stimuli used to change shapes are electroactive polymers, pressurised fluids or gasses, chemical stimulus and even light.

Founder Vincent Loubière says his team are “shooting for the moon to make the world a better place.”



Vincent Loubière: Exploring the future

“ProtoSpace embodies agility,” says Vincent Loubière. “We can move from concept to demonstrator quickly.” The ‘agility’ method is modelled on proven successes in the computer industry but the ProtoSpace team also works with automotive and communications blue-chips, as well as start-ups whose creations could have applications in aerospace.

ProtoSpace also helps Airbus manage risk associated with new developments by producing large-scale prototypes – notably for the installation of A320 Family Sharklet wingtip devices.

For example, the Airbus team is looking at using off-the-shelf virtual reality devices to expand a pilot’s field of vision during taxiing, and collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to explore new ‘digital’ materials. A number of ProtoSpace concepts are already under consideration for use on commercial aircraft. Furthermore, as part of a new agreement signed with Google, the team will look into more modular open hardware platforms for aeronautical applications.

In its first year, 14,000 people attended meetings and workshops at ProtoSpace facilities, producing 2,800 prototypes.

How to make almost anything

ProtoSpace is based on MIT’s Fab Lab digital fabrication workshops and Google’s hallmark flexible working environment. The aim is to be able to make ‘almost anything’ and then test it.

“It’s a question of tangibly and functionally representing ideas. When a concept is presented, people offer opinions, but if you put something concrete on the table, people really get involved, make constructive remarks and things progress faster,” Loubière explains.

ProtoSpace empowers people to do things for themselves. “The facility satisfies the urge to make something happen quickly,” Loubière enthuses. “I say to our users – ‘just do it!’”

ProtoSpace: An environment created to encourage innovation

Where inspiration comes from

Each ProtoSpace room is named after a sci-fi hero or iconic innovator, “Someone who shot for the moon to make the world a better place,” as Vincent Loubière puts it. US engineer Douglas Engelbart is Loubière’s favourite. In a seminal 1968 conference he predicted many of the developments that have since defined human interaction with computers including the desktop, video conferences and even the mouse.

Place of wonders

ProtoSpace’s workshops are an Ali Baba’s cave of invention (such as the Toulouse workshop shown here). There’s a 3D printer here, a milling machine there. Cockpit mock-ups jockey for space with tailcones for ejectable beacon trials, lightweight drones to inspect aircraft in final assembly and 360-degree virtual reality goggles that can relay real-time video of an aircraft’s exterior to the flight crew. There’s a sidestick attached to a prototype actuator to control the rudder instead of the pedals in use today.

Across the world

Airbus’ Emergency Technologies and Concepts team runs four ProtoSpaces in Europe and more are planned across the world. Each facility specialises in the areas of expertise of its host country: fuel systems, wings, landing gear for the UK, cabin for Germany and tail planes for Spain, as well as field requests from across the business. These ProtoSpaces have additional capabilities such as a large hangar (pictured here) in Filton that can host full-size wings.

Empowering the engineers

Alongside the workshop and manufacturing tools, the facilities in Toulouse host both an IT/electronics and integration lab. This entire environment has been conceived to reinforce the engineering spirit. Its aim is to better empower people to do things for themselves, while also offering a place in which they can engage actively with start-ups from around the world and bring innovation to the aircraft more quickly.

A330neo to commence the new chapter of the Airbus flying experience

Maximizing both passenger wellbeing and airline operations

Airbus has launched its new Cabin brand “Airspace by Airbus”. At the heart of this new philosophy Airbus connects the wellbeing for passengers with the operational performance for its airline customers. Representing the best of Airbus’ cabin innovation and design, Airspace will offer a sophisticated, flexible canvas as a back-drop to enhance the airlines’ own brands. Airbus also launches the new cabin for the forthcoming A330neo airliner, which embodies Airspace by Airbus and is inspired by the cabin of its Widebody sibling, the new A350 XWB in service.

Dr. Kiran Rao, Airbus’ Executive Vice President of Strategy and Marketing commented: “Airbus’ history of success is down to innovation – which has always included the cabin as a key driver. With the great passenger feedback on the A350 XWB, and our application of A350 cabin technology and features to the A330neo, we are proud to embrace our cabin design principles through our new brand – Airspace by Airbus.”

He adds: “The new A330neo is the launch vehicle for this brand, which along with the A350 XWB begins a new family of Airbus cabins. These will inspire and empower airlines to build the next generation of personalized flying experience for their passengers, while and at the same time optimizing the economic performance of their aircraft space.”

Encompassing four key dimensions: Comfort, Ambience, Service and Design*, Airspace cabins will be more relaxing, inspiring, beautiful and functional, they will stimulate a unique and leading passenger experience. For example, passengers will appreciate the larger overhead storage bins, spacious and contemporary lavatories, wider seats & aisles, and unobstructed under-seat foot space. In addition, signature design elements will be consistently recognizable throughout all Airspace cabins – examples include the latest LED technology ambient lighting, clean, straight lines and shapes, clear surfaces, and also a unique, customizable welcome area. Altogether, these aspects result in an aesthetically-pleasing design combined with not just a ‘feeling’ of space, but real space – which is fulfilled in the brand new cabin for the A330neo.

Airbus produces the world’s most modern and comprehensive family of airliners and continually invests in new innovations. These aircraft range in capacity from 100 to more than 600 seats and over 16,300 of which have been sold to more than 380 customers worldwide. Airbus has design and manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, the UK, and Spain, as well as subsidiaries in the US, China, Japan, India and in the Middle East.

*Note for Editors, the four key dimensions of Airspace by Airbus comprise:

· ‘Comfort’ is offered without compromise to provide more personal and relaxing space;

· ‘Ambience’ is enhanced with mood lighting, quietness and overall sense of space;

· Next generation ‘Services’ throughout the cabin provide interactive entertainment and connectivity, contemporary lavatory features and an enhanced working environment for the crew;

· ‘Design’ elements whichcreate visually appealing customizable cabins and ergonomic features and are also ‘designed to perform’ for the benefit of the airlines’ operations.

India is playing an increasingly important industrial role for Airbus as this country’s air transportation market continues to grow.Airbus’ cooperation with India offers the benefits of cost-competitiveness and a highly-skilled workforce, and is fully aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign to further develop the nation’s manufacturers, according to Dr. Srinivasan Dwarakanath, President of the Airbus Division at Airbus Group India.“I’m proud to say there’s something ‘made in India’ in every one of our aircraft being produced today,” Dwarakanath added.One of the largest Indian partners is Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which produces approximately half of the A320 Family’s forward passenger doors. HAL began supplying Airbus in the 1990s.Dynamatic Technologies in Bengaluru has been the sole supplier of A320 and A330 Family flap track beams since 2008, delivering these assemblies on which the wing flap surfaces extend and retract.Tata Advanced Materials Ltd provides composite parts for the A320 and A350 XWB wing, while TAL Manufacturing supplies over 500 sheet metal and machined parts and sub-assemblies.Supporting these major suppliers is a growing network of small and medium-sized companies, all being developed with Airbus’ encouragement to reach ramp-up capacity. CIM Tools, Gardner-Pranitha, Triveni and Sansera Aerospace are some of the better-known of these second-tier suppliers.The Airbus Engineering Centre in Bengaluru, which opened in 2007, is home to over 350 engineers who work across programmes and divisions. The city also hosts a BizLab accelerator, which helps Airbus speed up the transformation of ground-breaking ideas into valuable business propositions.In addition, Bengaluru is the nerve centre of the Emerging Technologies & Concepts team, responsible – among other things – for running Airbus’ Protospace rapid prototyping facilities. Since 2011, Airbus has operated two design centres in the city for fuselage and wings/pylons in partnership with the Indian companies AxisCADES and QuEST.“Made in India” components are flying on the expanding number of Airbus jetliners operated by Indian airlines, including the A320neo (new engine option), which has just entered the inventory of IndiGo – India’s largest airline by passenger numbers. IndiGo has ordered 430 A320neos, making it the largest customer for this aircraft type, with the airline acquiring 530 A320 Family jetliners in total.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9982378482818604}",positive,0.9982378482818604,1

The Spaceplane has been in the works since 2006, when Astrium, then a subsidiary of EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company) began developing the vehicle. Development slowed down in 2011, but the company has continued to work on the project in spite of the global economic crisis. ""We keep the investment going,"" said Astrium CEO François Auque in a BBC report. ""We continue to mature the concept, maintaining the minimum team, in order that when we find the relevant partnership we are ready and have progressed sufficiently.”

In June 2011, the development team was joined by a consortium of Singapore companies. At the time, Astrium officials said they were seeking more partners before establishing the project commercially. In 2014, EADS was restructured and reorganized as the Airbus Group, with what was previously known as Astrium being included in the Airbus Defence and Space division.

In June 2014, Airbus tested a quarter-scale demonstrator off the coast of Singapore. The demonstrator flew to 3 km and was piloted from a barge.

The vehicle currently in development at Airbus will carry four passengers as high as 100 kilometers, and be able to take off and land at a conventional airport. According to Airbus, the vehicle will operate in between the standard airplane and satellite altitudes, and open up a whole new market segment. The spaceplane could be used as a transfer service or for experiments and work in a part of space not occupied by many other vehicles.

During flight, a rocket engine will ignite at about 12 km to bring it up to operational flight, bringing it up to an altitude of 60km in only 80 seconds. The rocket propulsion system will then shut down as the plane’s inertia carries it on to over 100km, with weightlessness lasting for a few minutes at the top of the flight arc. The plane will then slow down and ignite the engines again for a runway landing. The entire trip is expected to last approximately two hours.

According to Airbus, the target is to produce five aircraft per year and eventually maintain a fleet of 30+ aircraft within the next ten years. Flights will cost about $225000 per passenger.

Although the plane underwent an in-atmosphere flight test in 2014, Airbus has not yet released a launch date. So far, they say that it could be possible to get into space ""about seven years after procuring development financing.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999165534973145}",neutral,0.9999165534973145,0

An easy-to-use testing tool for inspecting the composite airframe of Airbus’ popular A350 XWB jetliner has become a commercial success itself, with key airline customers ordering the device to support their daily operations.Named the Line Tool, this ultrasound system is used to inspect an A350 in the event of impact shocks. These can occur at airports if, for example, catering trucks, baggage loaders or other vehicles make hard contact with an aircraft.Easily portable in a small-sized suitcase, the Line Tool offers a simple and cost-effective solution for on-site inspections, and can be utilised by airline personnel who are not experts in composite materials. In addition, Line Tool employs the non-destructive testing (NDT) principle that allows damage assessments to be made without affecting the fuselage or wing area that is examined.“The Line Tool delivers an automatic diagnosis, which means that airlines can carry out their own tests straight away,” explained Patrick Métayer, the head of non-destructive testing at Airbus.A350 XWB customers ordering the inspection units to date are Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Finnair, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, TAM and Vietnam Airlines – which are acquiring a combined total of 70 systems from Airbus Customer Services.The Line Tool has been developed and commercialized using competencies from across the Airbus Group. Launched by Airbus in advance of the A350 XWB’s service entry, the system benefitted from structural health engineering capabilities of Airbus Group Innovations, the corporate-level research and technology network. TESTIA – the Airbus Group’s non-destructive testing and training subsidiary – has been involved in the product’s industrialization for Airbus Customer Services.In producing the A350 XWB jetliner family, Airbus uses carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) in more than 50 percent of the aircraft’s fuselage, wings and tail, providing the composite material’s benefits of lighter weight, as well as resistance to corrosion and fatigue.To further pursue non-destructive inspection concepts for airlines, Airbus is developing a similar solution for more “classic” metallic airframes. Called the Clad Tool, this follow-on device already is applied internally in Airbus final assembly line applications, and will be offered to customers beginning this summer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9339144229888916}",neutral,0.9339144229888916,0

Continued commitment to safety - 2nd FCOM released in under two years

Louisville, Kentucky (USA) – Airbus Helicopters is continuing to deliver on its commitment to safety as its number one priority with the release of the H175 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), coming just over a year after the release of the helicopter industry’s first-ever FCOM for the H225 in oil & gas configuration.The newest FCOM, designed specifically for the super-medium H175 in offshore configuration, was developed using the same methodology and objectives as for the H225.“The FCOM is an important source document providing best practices and recommendations directly from the manufacturer,” explained Gilles Bruniaux, Airbus Helicopters Vice President of Aviation Safety. “When we began working on the very first FCOM, it was already part of a larger strategy to expand to other aircraft in the Airbus Helicopters fleet. The H175 FCOM is the latest step in this roadmap, and we are proud to be able to offer this second information source that contributes to standardized operations throughout the industry.”Following the model applied for the H225, topics covered by the H175 FCOM include aircraft manufacturer guidance for enhanced operational safety during both routine and abnormal situations, with work-share management among pilots, focusing on procedures for operating state of the art glass cockpits and automated systems. In this respect, the H175 FCOM brings new added value as being the first to introduce operational guidance for the latest-generation Helionix avionics systems.Airbus Helicopters will continue to update both existing FCOMs in accordance with upgrades initiated on the helicopters. Plans are also underway to extend the scope to other missions, such as Search & Rescue (SAR) operations.Be sure to follow Airbus Helicopters for all the news and events throughout the show:Twitter: @AirbusHCAirbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide.

Airbus touts 400-seat 'A350-8000' jetliner - Jamestown Sun,"Thu, 03 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWVzdG93bnN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdG91dHMtNDAwLXNlYXQtYTM1MC04MDAwLWpldGxpbmVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PHOENIX - Airbus is seeking airline support for a new 400-seat jetliner provisionally dubbed the A350-8000 as competition escalates with Boeing over the world's largest two-engined jets, airline and aviation industry sources said.

After talking up the possibility of a new member of its A350 family, the European planemaker has swung into an active pre-marketing phase as it responds to a recent upgrade in the competing Boeing 777.

While Boeing has scored successes in the Gulf with its biggest-ever twin-engined jet, the 406-seat 777-9, Airbus is expected to aim its design at airlines that do not always require the performance needed for extreme Gulf conditions.

""It would have similar capacity and range (as the 777-9) and substantially lower seat-mile costs,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in an interview on the sidelines of the Istat Americas air finance conference.

""We are showing it to airlines right now.""

The project is the latest move in a game of leapfrog played by Airbus and Boeing over the past decade in the market for big twinjets, valued at about $1.9 trillion over 20 years.

It marks a shift in priorities after the oil price collapse eased pressure on Airbus to upgrade its larger four-engined A380, the output of which is declining because of slow sales.

Two airlines whose stance could be decisive in whether Airbus launches the new jet are Singapore Airlines and British Airways.

Singapore took delivery of its first smaller A350-900 model this week and has long been weighing up the 777-9.

Both airlines declined to comment.

In Singapore, where Airbus' planemaking president, Fabrice Bregier, stopped over on Thursday after a China visit, a company spokesman declined to comment.

The A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) family was launched after a string of setbacks in 2006 to compete with Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777.

Boeing responded to the all-new jet by upgrading its existing 777 family to include the 777-9, one of a pair of jets also known as the 777X series.

ADVERTISEMENT

Boeing has sold 306 777X jets. But after an initial burst, sales have hit a lean patch. Airbus has sold 181 A350-1000s.

KEY DECISIONS

The new, bigger A350 would use a derivative of the latest Rolls-Royce Trent XWB planned for the A350-1000. One person briefed on the plans said it would boost thrust to just over 100,000 pounds from the current 97,000.

Airbus believes that would compete well for a large majority of the industry's needs and eclipse the heavier 777X.

Boeing dismissed the proposal.

""We're not surprised that Airbus is attempting to fill a hole in its product lineup after losing market share to the 777X. At the end of the day, we'll still have the better airplane,"" Marketing Vice-President Randy Tinseth told Reuters.

Some analysts said a key to the project would be how easily Rolls-Royce could expand a full slate of projects, even without pushing performance to the limits needed by Mideast carriers.

ADVERTISEMENT

""This sounds like they are making a virtue of its lack of hot-and-high performance compared to 777-9 when maybe it's the case that Rolls can't afford, or doesn't want to, do a much bigger and substantially new engine,"" said Nick Cunningham of UK-based Agency Partners.

One engine expert estimated the upgrade could cost half a billion dollars and require a bigger fan and new materials.

Rolls-Royce was not immediately available for comment.

To give the new jet enough capacity and range, Airbus would boost the maximum takeoff weight to just over 319 tonnes from 308 tonnes on the A350-1000, the person briefed on the plans said.

But it would sacrifice some range compared with the 8,000-mile A350-1000.

Airbus says it has not made a final decision on whether to launch a new A350 and will provide an update at the Farnborough Airshow in July.

It has been weighing what to call the new member of the A350 XWB family, reflecting deeper decisions on market positioning that can affect billions of dollars in sales.

It needs to strike a balance between protecting sales of the A350-1000, by emphasizing what is new, without weakening its long-held mantra of commonality between related aircraft.

ADVERTISEMENT

Until now, the possible new model was widely known in the industry as the A350-1100, continuing a sequence from the 276-seat A350-800 to the 315-seat A350-900 and 366-seat A350-1000.

Sources now say it is being pre-marketed with a surprise new identity, the A350-8000, although a final decision has yet to be taken. An earlier working title was A350-1000 XL.

Leahy confirmed Airbus was reluctant to call it A350-1100.

""You don't want it so close to the 1000 that it is an either-or decision. You have the 1000 and another airplane, with equal gaps of 40 seats between the 900 and 1000 (models), and then whatever this becomes.""

Eight is a number widely used by planemakers and is seen as a symbol of success in a key battleground for sales: Asia.

""Eight is a very nice number out in Asia, but we are not going to comment until we launch the program,"" Leahy said.

If the name is confirmed, Airbus will be hoping to bury any association with the last jet to use the 8000 model code: a VIP version of its A340, only one of which was ever built.

3-Mississippi DPS - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLTMtbWlzc2lzc2lwcGktZHBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Southern heat and high precipitation characterize operations for Mississippi’s Department of Public Safety, charged with security and law enforcement for a state as vast as the river it’s named after. To get the job done, one helicopter stands out above the rest—the H125 which, this year at HAI Heli-Expo 2016, is being displayed at the Airbus Helicopters stand.

Bordered by the great Mississippi River to the west, open to the Gulf of Mexico in the south, Mississippi’s landscape comprises plains, farmland, and acres of pine, hardwood swamp, and coastal grasslands. Temperatures in summer can reach into the 90s (33˚C) and average annual rainfall is more than 50 in (127 cm). In other words, “hot and muggy,” says Captain Ron Kelley, Director of Air Operations for the Mississippi Highway Patrol and Department of Public Safety (MHP/MDPS).For the department’s H125 helicopter, tasked with covering airborne law enforcement for the state, that means a variety of terrain and conditions to contend with. “Visibility is the biggest challenge,” says Kelley. “We see a lot of trees and ground vegetation outside of the city areas. Mississippi is rural with a lot of forest—unless you’re working in the Delta area, which is flat farmland.”When the department needed to replace its aging aircraft fleet, visibility and cockpit size were factors in the choice of new helicopter. “In the H125, we have the ability to see more area when visually searching during the day, as well as during night vision goggle (NVG) operations,” says Kelley. “The amount of room in the cockpit for controllers, keyboards and helmets with mounted NVGs is like no other helicopter on the market. The cockpit’s space and visibility are key in providing a safe operational environment.”That ability to see and be seen aids the airborne division in operations involving manhunts, search and rescue (SAR), disaster relief and marijuana eradication—and, often, missions where simple altitude is needed. “We received a call about an elderly woman who had been missing for 24 hours,” says Kelley. “Temperatures were in the upper 90s, so dehydration was a big concern. We located her an hour into the search about 150 yards in a cornfield. Because of how far she was inside the field and the height of the corn, it would have been almost impossible for searchers on the ground to locate her. What made this mission so special was that the next day was July 4th, a day for family, and a burden had been lifted from this woman’s family.”The Mississippi DPS’s H125 was produced entirely in Columbus, Miss., where Airbus Helicopters Inc. also builds UH-72A Lakotas. Since 2014, the site has added a full final assembly line for the H125. The law enforcement completion package was handled at the company’s headquarters in Grand Prairie, Texas. With its ability to accommodate a variety of mission packages, the H125 has become a favorite with law enforcement agencies around the country.For the Mississippi Highway Patrol’s Air Wing, the AStar’s multi-role mission configuration also serves in carrying out law enforcement across a state comprising almost 3 million people. “The H125’s power and speed benefit us on every mission,” says Kelley. “But I really like how this platform is so versatile. This helicopter can be effective in multiple roles.”Having access to local technical support has proven to be a key element in keeping the helicopter up and doing its job. “We had a minor maintenance issue and the response from Airbus Helicopters was immediate,” Kelley says. “They were quick to include other parties who needed to be involved, to get the issue resolved.” And operations get a boost from the DPS’s personal commitment to safety. “We ensure that our pilots and maintenance personnel receive the best training possible and we give them the best equipment to accomplish the mission,” Kelley says. “I truly believe that the training we receive from Airbus Helicopters is paramount in helping us maintain a great safety record.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999793767929077}",neutral,0.9999793767929077,0
"Airbus reveal ""Airspace"" interior for A330neo ahead of Interiors Show - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy8yNC9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFsLWFpcnNwYWNlLWludGVyaW9yLWEzMzBuZW8tYWhlYWQtaW50ZXJpb3JzLXNob3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"March 24, 2016, © Leeham Co.: Airbus launched its Airspace brand for a new cabin design for the A330neo, two weeks ahead of the big, international Aircraft Interiors Expo April 5-7 in Hamburg. The news made a big splash in social media and ups the game in the passenger experience competition with rival Boeing.

A series of Airbus photos may be found here.

The interior redesign for the A330 is overdue. While the current offering is pleasant enough, and it’s functional, Boeing’s interior designed for the 787 and subsequently adapted to the 737 and 747-8, was stunning when first unveiled more than a decade ago.

Airbus continues to promote its 18-inch wide seats in the Airspace design. This is in eight abreast. This compares with the 17-inch wide seats in the 787 in the most common configuration ordered by airlines today, nine abreast. Boeing initially intended the 787 to be an eight abreast, 18-inch wide seat. This would have matched the A330 comfort, but airlines are cramming more seats in the 787 and the Boeing 777, reducing the seat width of 17.1 inches. A few low cost carriers configured the A330ceo to nine abreast, resulting in a 16.7 inch wide seat.

Other features of Airspace:

Airbus relocated the crew rest quarters to the lower deck.

Larger overhead baggage bins have been adopted.

New lighting and customization allows for up to 16.7 million color variations. (This falls into the overkill category.)

Magazine racks, window bezels and other features have been redesigned.

New In-Flight Entertainment features have been upgraded to what Airbus calls fourth generation design. These boxes have been moved from underseat locations to allow more legroom.

Lavatories have been redesigned, providing some wheelchair access.

The latter is welcome, when one considers that more recently, “space-saving” lavs have been designed and introduced on Airbus and Boeing narrow-body airplanes to permit more seats in the cabin. One wag noted that these new lavs make it nearly impossible to, ahem, wipe oneself.

The passenger experience battle between Airbus and Boeing is nothing new. For many years, Boeing has shown renderings of the 777 cabin overlaid an A330 cabin, and later, the A350. The former is wider than either of the latter. Boeing uses these illustrations to promote more shoulder and head room for the 777. Airbus in recent years retaliated with its 18-inch seat width campaign, using an effective photo of three people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder in the Boeing seats compared with more comfortable Airbus seats.

Ironically, Airbus made its Airspace announcement the day after Aviation Week published a story about cramming more seats into airplanes.

Airbus Helicopters begins H160 commercialization - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWJlZ2lucy1oMTYwLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxpemF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters will begin taking letters of intent for the H160 as HAI Heli-Expo 2016 gets underway in Louisville, Ky., today, as the manufacturer officially begins the aircraft’s commercialization phase.

The new 5.5- to 6-tonne aircraft has seen rapid development since it was unveiled as the result of Airbus Helicopters’ X4 program at Heli-Expo 2015 in March last year. The first prototype (PT1) was assembled in just nine months and performed its first flight on June 13, 2015, and was followed in flight by the second prototype (PT2) on Jan. 27, 2016. The first flight of PT2 also marked the first flight of the 1,200-shaft-horsepower Turbomeca Arrano engines in an H160 (the Arrano is the engine that will be used in the production version of the aircraft), and as Heli-Expo opened its doors, the two prototypes had accumulated a total of over 100 flight hours.

“We’ll [now] start to talk with customers and we are willing to sign letters of intent with them and enter into a process of negotiation in order to sign contracts in a few months,” said Bernard Fujarski, head of the H160 program, at a press briefing ahead of the show. “We believe that we now have the maturity to be able to do that. Before you take commitment, you have to know exactly what you are able to do. And we will know that regarding the performance of the helicopter in a few months from now.”

Fujarski pointed to the two “Helicopter Zero” test bench aircraft, created at Airbus Helicopters’ facility in Marignane, France, as one of the reasons the program has matured so quickly. “System Helicopter Zero” houses the aircraft’s electrical equipment and harnesses, together with the H160 cockpit, to refine and ensure the functionality of the electrical systems; “Dynamic Helicopter Zero” contains the H160’s engines, transmission, rotors and tail boom.

“Each month [on previous programs] we used to fly about 10 to 12 hours, [and] we are flying now 20 percent more because we have been able to test and mature the definition and design on our Helicopter Zeros,” he said.

Flight tests have seen the H160’s flight envelope gradually expanded, with the aircraft recording a max speed of 182 knots — 12 knots higher than its planned never exceed speed of 170 knots. While hesitant to provide too much detail of the pilot feedback, Fujarski praised the aircraft’s aerodynamic behavior and handling qualities.

“We performed most of the first 20 hours of flight without the autopilot, and it was very easy for the crew to control the helicopter,” he said. “There is a sort of natural decoupling between the axis, which is extremely good.”

Aiding that control is one of the aircraft’s most striking design features — its 12-degree tilted Fenestron. “The tail rotor is working a little bit better than expected,” said Fujarski. “In fact, it’s asking for less power for the same efficiency than predicted by the simulation.”

Without having completed official performance tests for the Arrano-powered PT2, Fujarski declined to compare its performance to the PW210E-powered PT1, but said that the data would be available within the next few weeks. “On the bench . . . the [Arrano] engine is 100 percent compliant to the specification,” he said. “But we don’t have the final data yet. The feeling is good, but we don’t have a measurement, and we haven’t performed all the flight tests according to the specifications.”

So far, the most significant modification from the first two prototypes to the likely production aircraft will be to address a slight nose-up attitude in the hover. To correct this, the H160’s electrical master boxes will be moved from the rear of the aircraft to the nose — beginning with the third prototype aircraft (PT3), which is set to join the testing fleet at the start of 2017.

Maturing the Design

In tandem with the development of the aircraft, Airbus Helicopters has been designing the manufacturing program to be employed for the full-scale production of the H160. For the serial aircraft, the manufacturer will use a “major component assembly” model, whereby five modules (tail boom, central fuselage, front fuselage, main dynamic components, and blades) are fully built and tested in parallel, then shipped to the H160’s final assembly line (FAL) in Marignane. The aim is to reduce the lead time on the assembly line from the Dauphin’s 36 weeks, to 18 weeks with the H160.

For now, Airbus Helicopters is beginning to validate the industrial model using a digital mockup and through the first pre-serial helicopter (of a total of five or six), which, for some equipment, will be created using a method borrowed from the automotive industry called “the ring.”

“Let’s take, for instance, the example of flight controls,” said Fujarski, explaining the concept. “The day we will install flight controls within the [first pre-serial] helicopter, we will have the designer of flight controls together with the guy in charge of fitting flight controls, plus a member of quality. Together they will be protected by a physical ring, [so] nobody is interfering with what they are doing, and the guy in charge of assembly will try to apply the procedure. If it does match, it is ok. If there’s a problem with the procedure, it is corrected live. If it is a problem with the design, the designer is there, and eventually the supplier is there as well to take into account the correction and implement it very rapidly.”

The first station on the FAL is set to be delivered by the end of the year. Currently, the plan is for the H160 FAL to use the building currently occupied by the Dauphin FAL. However, Fujarski said a timeline hasn’t been set for H155 production to stop. “It depends on the market and the ability of the Dauphin program still to capture sales and our ability also to ramp up as predicted,” he said. “We have a plan, but it will be probably adjusted depending on the environment and the circumstances.”

The H160 will be produced in one of several “favorite configurations,” similar to the existing manufacturing process for the H135, H145, and H175. Anthony Pecchi Photo

Work is due to begin on the first production H160 early next year. The assembly line will begin as a flow line with limited speed, said Fujarski, before pushing to a full production rate of 50 helicopters per year around aircraft number 12 or 13.

Finally, in order to have a fully mature product at entry-into-service, Airbus Helicopters has been working on the H160’s maintenance support and services. This has included the selection of Helisim and Thales for the design and manufacture of an H160 full flight simulator, and the creation of digital maintenance documentation and a digital flight manual to support the target of creating a paperless aircraft.

Upcoming Developments

Looking ahead, PT1 will soon take a break from flight-testing to be re-engined with the Arrano. (It is currently fitted with the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210E — which was originally planned to be one of two engines offered with the aircraft, before Airbus Helicopters decided to continue development with the Arrano alone.) PT1 and PT2 will then be joined by PT3 — the final prototype H160 — at the beginning of 2017. Those three aircraft, together with the two Helicopter Zero test bench aircraft, will take the program’s development through to certification and first delivery.

The H160 will be produced in one of several “favorite configurations,” similar to the existing manufacturing process for the H135, H145, and H175. As things stand, the “transport” configuration — which covers both oil-and-gas and emergency medical services missions — will be the first configuration offered when the aircraft is certified in 2018. A year later, a VIP version will be available, followed by a public service configuration a year after that.

“We are using the coming months, starting at HAI [Heli-Expo] until the summertime, to really assess the market and see if that order is still the right one,” said Fujarski. “We’ll be able, if necessary, to readjust the sequence in the summertime.”

A military version of the aircraft has not yet been launched, but Fujarski said the manufacturer has entered discussions with the French ministry of defense about offering a H160M to meet the requirements of its upcoming hélicoptère interarmées léger (HIL) program. The acquisition process for the HIL program, which would replace hundreds of light and medium helicopters operated by all three branches of the French military, is expected to begin in 2020.

Fujarski said the H160 had already generated a huge amount of interest since its debut last year. “The attractiveness of the aircraft has gone far beyond our expectations,” he said. “It was confirmed as well during the Paris Air Show and Dubai Airshow where we got a lot of feedback — and especially from the VIP market, where it was less expected.”

While the H160 will not be making a physical appearance at this year’s Heli-Expo, visitors will have the opportunity to explore it through a brand new, interactive virtual reality presentation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999898672103882}",neutral,0.9999898672103882,0
Airbus believes passengers will seek out A330neo with new cabin - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDMvYWlyYnVzLWJlbGlldmVzLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtd2lsbC1zZWVrLW91dC1hMzMwbmVvLXdpdGgtbmV3LWNhYmluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new Airspace by Airbus cabin offering was unveiled in London this morning, bringing details of the A330neo interior into view and demonstrating some of the new features which the airframer will make available to its airline customers and, of course, passengers.

The new design builds on improvements the A350XWB brought to the cabin and focuses on improvements in four key areas: Comfort, Ambiance, Service and Design. These touch on both the passenger and crew comfort on board, ultimately allowing Airbus to provide a spacious and pleasant experience for passengers, even while adding 10 seats on the A330neo model compared to the A330ceo.

The most significant and truly new development the Airspace interior brings to the cabin is a new overhead bin design. The company claims a 66% increase in bag capacity (five bags can be stowed in a typical bin with the new design), which will increase passenger satisfaction and reduce boarding time. The bins also feature new doors which offer an integrated hand grip and LED lighting to improve the passenger experience. The bins sit higher when closed, adding a more spacious feel to the cabin. The lavatories will also see updates based on the Space-Flex hybrid galley/lav concept. Lavs will include options for ambient aroma and sound amenities while also offering antimicrobial surfaces and touchless fixtures as part of the standard offering.

The company believes that the overall offering will be significantly better than the #PaxEx offered on competing aircraft types, both because of the default 18″ seat width and the other factors. It believes passengers will seek out the A330neo as they plan their flights. Indeed, Airbus executives are keen that the Airspace cabin interior is something to be talked about and discussed on social media, just as much as the airline brand.

Building this brand – an Airbus brand – is a significant part of the new offerings, says EVP marketing & strategy Kiran Rao during the press conference. “It is not just about the seat. it is much more than that. There are many more aspects to the cabin that need to be looked at. The spaciousness, the whole environment of the airplane. When you start pulling all of that together it starts to represent a brand.”

This point – taking over the branding of the cabin interior from the airlines – presents obvious challenges and Airbus backed off a bit throughout the morning after starting with that strong statement. They do expect that the airlines will own the branding but they want to provide a “luxury apartment building to which the airline can bring its own furniture”. There will be plenty of options for airlines to choose from, whether it is the 16 million colors in the LED lighting system or the ability to custom design lighting schemes for monuments in the boarding entryway via 3D printing systems. But there will also be significant consistencies, the “infrastructure” Airbus will provide to ensure the comfortable passenger experience and over which the airlines will layer their custom design attributes.

Airbus expects that passengers will come to recognize that they are on an Airbus aircraft, that they are flying in an Airspace cabin (on the A330neo or the A350 with the significant similarities) and then that they are on a particular airline’s plane. Airbus is listening both to its customers (the airlines) and also to their customers (the passengers) to come up with solutions that can meet the needs of all parties. It is also working to make sure that its name and brand are part of that experience, hopefully in a positive way.

Just how airlines take to this approach will depend on many factors but the most significant is likely to be just how comfortable the offering is for their passengers. Airbus acknowledges that it is constantly watching online and social media channels to gauge passenger impressions of different aircraft configurations. Francois Caudron, Airbus’ SVP marketing, described the initial feedback from airline customers as overwhelmingly positive, saying, “The first message was ‘Thank you, Airbus, for investing in the place where we make our revenue. We’ve seen over the past years some of your suppliers being more proactive and innovative than you were. We’re really glad to see you back in cabin innovation.’ Clearly they really see great value in the alignment in the A350 and A330 and eventually the single aisle.”

The launch event was big on ideas and renderings; we must wait a couple short weeks until the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg to get “hands on” with a cabin mockup. Airbus has promised to have such at its booth at the show for visitors to explore.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9019232988357544}",positive,0.9019232988357544,1

The plane flew in to the record books Wednesday when it landed in Auckland, New Zealand after an 8,824 mile non-stop journey from Dubai.

The journey beat the previous record set by Qantas which travels 8,577 miles between Dallas Fort Worth and Sydney.

The Emirates return flight to Dubai was expected to set a new flight-time record at 17 hours and 15 minutes, but landed earlier than scheduled according to New Zealand media.

Any time-record the route does set won't last long, as Emirates has already announced another non-stop service to begin this month between its headquarters in Dubai and Panama City.

Emirates said that route, while shorter in distance than Dubai to Auckland, will see passengers spend 17 hours and 35 minutes in the air.

The aircraft contracted for Wednesday at Heli-Expo 2016 in Louisville, Ky. will be delivered to the California law enforcement agency in March and is expected to be in service this summer.

Orange County currently operates a pair of earlier model Airbus AS350 B2 AStars, one of which will be replaced by the new H125 (formerly AS350 B3e).



Orange County uses its AStars for a variety of law enforcement and public service missions including patrol flights, search and rescue, long line personnel insertions for drug eradication and airborne SWAT team sniper operations.



“The Orange County Sheriff’s Department Aviation Support Unit is looking forward to replacing its older Airbus AS350 B2 Helicopter with the upgraded and more powerful Airbus H125 Helicopter,” said Sgt. William Fitzgerald. “Airbus Helicopters has served the Orange County Sheriff’s Department well over the past 12 years. We are looking forward to continuing our relationship with Airbus Helicopters.”



The H125 (also known as AS350 B3e) is produced by Airbus Helicopters Inc. at its plant in Columbus, Miss. The highly reliable, high-performance, multi-mission H125 is the most popular single-engine helicopter among U.S. law enforcement agencies.



Four other California law enforcement agencies have recently taken delivery of new H125s. Two each were delivered to the California Highway Patrol and Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, and one each to the Los Angeles Police Department and Ontario Police Department.



“We are pleased that the Orange County Sheriff’s Department has shown their continued faith in Airbus Helicopters and the AStar family of aircraft,” said Ed Van Winkle, Senior Sales Manager of law enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “They join a growing list of respected law enforcement agencies that have found Airbus Helicopters AStars to be the right aircraft for their missions, and who are now upgrading to the more capable H125.”



The H125 is an ideal law enforcement platform because of its enhanced power and maneuverability, load carrying capacity and hot- and high-performance capabilities. The single-engine H125 is the latest version of the Airbus Helicopters AStar family of helicopters.



Powered by the Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine, the H125 boasts a high cruise speed up to 140 knots and extra lifting capability. It is equipped with a dual digital engine control (FADEC) system, Engine Data Recorder, and Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) – enhancing safety and systems management while reducing workload for pilots.

A further significant step in Airbus’ internationalization and partnership with China

Marking a new milestone for Airbus international footprint and strategic partnership with China, construction has begun for Airbus’ A330 the Airbus A330 Completion and Delivery Centre in Tianjin, China. Duan Chunhua, Vice Mayor Tianjin– Lin Nianxiu, Vice Minister of NDRC– Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO– and Lin Zuoming, Chairman of AVIC are pictured from left to right at the groundbreaking ceremony

Airbus has taken additional steps in the expansion of its global footprint and its strategic partnership with China as construction gets underway for the Airbus A330 Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC) in Tianjin, China.The A330 C&DC will be co-located at the same site as the Airbus Tianjin A320 Family Final Assembly Line and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre.“The ground breaking ceremony for the A330 C&DC in Tianjin marks a new milestone for Airbus’ international footprint and underlines the strong cooperation with our Chinese partners,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO. “This event is significant because the A330 C&DC in Tianjin is our first completion and delivery centre for widebody aircraft outside Europe. Airbus’ long-standing cooperation with China spans single aisle and now also widebody aircraft and we will continue to look for further opportunities in the future.”In summer 2014, Airbus, Tianjin Free Trade Zone (TJFTZ) and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) signed a framework agreement on setting up an A330 C&DC in Tianjin. The A330 C&DC Tianjin will cover the aircraft completion activities including cabin installation, aircraft painting and flight test, as well as aircraft delivery and customer flight acceptance. The A330 Family aircraft to be completed at the A330 C&DC Tianjin will be assembled in Toulouse while painting and cabin fitting will be performed in Tianjin.This latest development of Airbus’ cooperation in China perfectly supports the forecast for passenger air traffic in China which is set to grow well above the world average of 4.6%. The average annual growth for the domestic air traffic market in China will be at 6.9% and that for the international market is forecast to be at 6.8%. The key underlying factors for the forecast are as follows: China’s long term economic outlook remains positive, Chinese middle class continues to increase and Chinese outbound tourism is expanding.According to Airbus’ 2015-2034 Global Market Forecast, new deliveries of passenger aircraft over 100 seats and freighters greater than 10 tonnes for China will be around 5,400 comprising 3,630 single aisle aircraft and 1,770 twin-aisle and very large aircraft. This represents about 17 per cent of the world total demand for some 32,600 new aircraft in the same period. The total market value for the forecast new aircraft to be delivered to China is over US$840 billion.At present, the in-service Airbus fleet with Chinese operators comprises more than 1240 aircraft (over 170 A330 Family and over 1,000 A320 Family aircraft). Airbus A330 is the most popular wide-body aircraft in China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6820869445800781}",neutral,0.6820869445800781,0

The latest addition to the fleet was received with a water-cannon salute at Changi Airport in Singapore, after a long journey from the Airbus delivery center in Toulouse, France. ""The addition of the A350-900 exemplifies Singapore Airlines' longstanding commitment to operate a young and modern fleet,"" Goh said. ""The A350 will be a game-changer for us, allowing for flights to more long-haul destinations on a non-stop basis, which will help us boost our network competitiveness and further develop the important Singapore hub.""

Singapore's Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, was a guest of honor for the arrival of the new aircraft. The delivery marks the first step in the airline's major overhaul of its current fleet in the medium to long-haul range, in a bid to maintain its position as the standard-setting full service carrier in Asia. The aircraft will be operated on Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur flights on a temporary basis while crew are trained on it, before being put to work on 13-hour flights to Amsterdam from May 9. Singapore Airlines also plans to use the aircraft to add services to Dusseldorf, Germany, from July. The airline will offer business, premium economy and economy class seats on the flights, as well as what Singapore Airlines' SVP for Marketing Planning Lee Wen Fen described as the world's most advanced in-flight entertainment system.

The carrier said the addition to its fleet would offer customers an improved travel experience, with new features including higher ceilings, larger windows and special ambient LED lighting that is designed to reduce jetlag and project ""special effects"" onto the ceiling of the plane.

AirlineRatings.com Editor Geoffrey Thomas said the A350 gave Singapore Airlines a big advantage over other regional carriers because it allowed it to compete with airlines that had the Boeing 787. ""The A350 is slightly larger than the 787 and is a true Boeing 777-200 replacement,"" he told CNBC. ""The A350 is a major leap forward over the Boeing 777 in economics and passenger comfort thanks to its composite structure and new technology engines."" Airbus claims the A350 has 25 percent better fuel consumption than its current aluminum long-range competitors, and that despite being 68 times more powerful than a F1 racing car, it's also one of the quietest in its class. According to Singapore Airlines, the first batch of A350-900s for long-haul flights will seat 253 passengers across the three classes of seating.

Competitive advantage

Singapore Airlines is Airbus's biggest customer for the A350-900, having placed its first order for the aircraft in July 2006.

It now has 67 A350s on firm order, including seven of an ultra-long-range model that will be delivered in 2018 for use on non-stop services between Singapore and the U.S. Singapore Airlines expects to take delivery of 11 A350-900s in the aircraft's first year of operation and has the option to purchase 20 additional A350s. AirAsia X, Air China, Asiana Airlines, Japan Airlines, Thai Airways and Vietnam Airlines have also placed orders for the aircraft, while Asian rival Cathay Pacific is set to receive its first A350 ""in the coming months"" according to reports. ""The Asian market is extremely competitive with China emerging as a big threat to traditional dominant players such as Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways,"" Thomas said. ""There is also long haul competition from the Middle East giants. Plus, recently old players such as U.S.-based United Airlines are dramatically up-gauging their product with 787s and offering new non-stops such as San Francisco to Singapore from June 1.""

Airbus Airspace cabin is built with Coach Comfort in mind - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDMvYWlyYnVzLWFpcnNwYWNlLWNhYmluLWlzLWJ1aWx0LXdpdGgtY29hY2gtY29tZm9ydC1pbi1taW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We all know that in first class and business class you can create beautiful spaces. But most passengers make their way to the back of the airplane and that’s where the squeeze is on.

The new Airspace by Airbus cabin concept was released this week and, for once, an aircraft interior launch appeared to be focused squarely on the 3 billion travelers who board a flight each year in the back of the plane. That’s not to say premium cabins were ignored – they were not – but multiple Airbus executives took the stage in London or sat with media throughout the event and they were all actually excited about the economy class cabin, shifting the conversation in that direction rather than trying to avoid such discussions. Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus’ VP marketing summed up the feeling well early in the day, explaining that Airbus wants “to create an awareness and desire for passengers to fly more comfortable”. And he was quite clear: This is not just about big spenders in the lie-flat beds.

Have we finally found a product truly designed around the volume of passengers more than just the theory of luxury which can be delivered up front?

Arguably most important is that Airbus is sticking to its 18″ seat width for 8-abreast coach, with a good portion of the presentation spent talking about both the actual and perceived benefits the “extra inch” brings to each passenger. Comfort and Ambiance are two of the four design pillars the Airspace cabin is driven by and both benefit from that extra width. But seat width is not the only area where Airbus is focused. The company is quick to point out that the new Airspace layout takes advantage of the nextgen v4 entertainment systems design which dramatically reduces the impact of the seat box on legroom. Again, just an inch here or there under the seat but that makes a big difference, especially for taller passengers already feeling the squeeze.

That does not mean, however, that everything about the economy cabin is going to be more spacious. Airbus still plans to add an extra row or so of seats with a comparable comfort level to the prior iteration of the cabin. This comes through use of the Space-Flex galley/lav design and other, small tweaks which add up throughout the cabin to eke out the inches necessary for the extra seats. Wuggetzer described some of these tweaks, saying, “We have a new location for the crew rest. We [have] done smart lifts in a way that the interior space is the same but due to how we do the piping and electricity the outer dimension gets smaller. By combining those smart monuments you collect inch-by-inch, then you get a row. It is not one element; it is a set of elements with different needs from different airlines based on their needs and segmentation.”

Of course, all of this optimism could come crashing down in a hurry if airlines decide to push the density issue to 9-abreast. And, just like on the A380 and the A350 and the A330ceo, Airbus executives acknowledged that the company would facilitate that decision if an airline customer chose it. The 9-abreast option remains alive in the A330neo fuselage, sacrificing seat width below the 18″ comfort standard the company is pushing. That would be a shame from a customer perspective but it would be naïve to believe it will not happen at some point.

So, does the coach experience in the new A330neo cabin have a chance to be great? Based on what Airbus is showing off so far the answer is a resounding yes. And probably even worth dealing with the smaller lavs and the logo etched on the windows to get there.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.883624792098999}",neutral,0.883624792098999,0

In its on-going effort to help reduce aviation’s contribution to climate change, Airbus has designed and built an innovative paint booth for its new-generation A350 XWB jetliner that uses significantly less energy than standard facilities, while also minimising CO2 emissions.Airbus’ current livery painting process requires a constant temperature of 21-26 deg. C, as well as a humidity rate between 45 and 70 per cent – which presents a particular challenge during summer and winter months, when more energy is needed to overcome hot/cold outside temperatures and maintain the necessary conditions for painting.Now in service at Airbus’ Saint-Nazaire plant in France, the new paint booth recovers heat from the paint shop using a rotary heat exchanger called an Enthalpic wheel. To complete the system, the project team replaced gas-heated boilers with a CO2 heat pump – heating water to 85 deg. C and furnishing 21 deg. C inside the booth, eliminating the CO2 emissions from gas combustion.“This project is giving a 67-per cent saving in energy use and an 86-per cent reduction in CO2 emissions, with the remaining 14 per cent CO2 emissions coming from the electrical power required for fans and the heat pump,” said project leader Pascal Danthony.He added: “The huge advantage of this project is that it can be applied across all our paint shops on other sites. With a return on investment of four years, this project is really leading the way for future energy reductions and achieving zero CO2 emissions from our industrial processes.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8402706980705261}",negative,0.8402706980705261,-1

(Or at least make icebergs jiggle a bit.)

Airbus revealed its new will-actually-happen cabin, called Airspace, in London this week, and it is designed to make travelers happy online and in the air.

The aircraft manufacturer credited social media and the Internet for making their designers sit up, take notice and write stuff down, before heading back to the drawing board.

""In the past, we just created a great product and we allowed the airlines to customize it and to do what they want to do on the airplane,” explained Dr. Kiran Rao, executive vice president of strategy and marketing at Airbus. “Today we're reaching out to the passengers who fly on the aircraft. Today they are making big decisions based on product, and the experience that they have. So we listen to our customers and our customers' customers.""

The customers of customers

Those “customer’s customers” would be us — the tweeting, sharing, raving, rating, flying public.

""They, through social media, are ... comparing one airline versus another, they're comparing one seat versus another,” said Rao. “They're comparing the experience they have from one airline to another. That is what has driven the change from what we've done in the past.”

Airbus’ new Airspace cabin will launch on the manufacturer's new A330neo aircraft in 2017.

The Airspace borrows a lot from the attractive design features of Airbus’ new A350 aircraft — which is good.

With a well thought out cabin layout and a well-lit open airy cabin feel, the A350 has proven to be a nice way to fly.

The Airspace cabin adds appropriate touches which fit the new Airbus A330neo model, and decorative touches which let airlines personalize their aircraft without (hopefully) messing the whole thing up.

Airbus even proposed 3D printed decorative panels to play off special cabin lighting, creating pleasing decorative light displays. The manufacturer later clarified that 3D printed panels are not included, and were merely a future decor suggestion.

Still, Airbus created both a feeling of space onboard and — this is the important bit — actual space.

Airbus also said they will stick to their guns and insist airlines pick a reasonably passenger friendly cabin lay-out, avoiding cabin crowding and ensuring each passenger gets an 18” inch seat. But airlines make the final decision.

Because social

To persuade airlines to leave Airspace alone, Airbus will use feedback from the online community.

“We do see some metrics coming out from social media,” said François Caudron, Senior VP Marketing. “So you can see that those things are happening. I mean six months ago there was nothing.”

Note: We did not have the heart to interrupt Caudron to tell him that social media, the internet and travel rating sites are not six months old. He’s such a nice man and seemed so pleased with his discovery that we just let him talk.

“You go on the TripAdvisor site and you see all airlines labeled and they are being rated. It is a big change and, yes, I think the passenger is becoming a consumer,” Caudron continued. “Basically, like any other product, he's not just buying the product but the experience that goes with it. He wants to share his own experience but also benefit from others' experience. ‘OK, you flew on that airline. You flew on this airline. What did you think of it?’ It is very quickly changing. We can notice the difference over the past six months.” (Awww. Bless.)

The manufacturer hopes to assuage passenger fears and persuade airlines that they need to pay attention to online customer feedback.

“Previously, the customer would go on the web and book his flight and mainly check the prices,” Caudron continued. “Today there are tools available with Seat Guru and things like that — which have been around for quite some time — but now there are much more collaborative platforms coming up with Routehappy and TripAdvisor.”

Caudron’s point: People talk about planes online, and Airbus gets that.

People have also been freaking out about some sadly misunderstood patent concepts floating around the interwebs over the past year, and Airbus gets that too.

The manufacturer hopes to assuage passenger fears and persuade airlines that they need to pay attention to online customer feedback.

“These different factors are coming into the decision making process. I mean, if you're a passenger, what else do you care about other than the cabin? This is the place where you can live for 8 or 12 hours. This is your prime focus. ‘What kind of comfort am I going to get?’” Caudron asks — just as you might.

The cabin with the most ""likes"" wins

If we had a skeptical nature, we’d say that all this talk of social media is a selling pitch to persuade airlines that Airspace by Airbus is the flyer-preferred option. But we would never say a thing like that. We’ll let Airbus say it.

“It's essential to us that when a passenger wants to book a flight they check whether it's an Airspace cabin, and if it's an Airspace cabin it means spaciousness and smartness and comfort features,” Caudron said.

Bottom line, with monuments and galleys redesigned to leave more room for passengers, a lovely welcome onboard area, plenty of room for luggage in the overhead bins, better environmental controls and soothing decorative lighting, the Airspace by Airbus should be a very pleasant flying experience — assuming airlines get out of its way.

Check it out: Airbus offers an immersive virtual reality tour on-line.

Nice. Right? You have yourself, your friends, and all the people you've ever hearted, thumbs-upped or starred to thank for this. The online community has finally sparked a flying revolution.

Well, not a ""revolution"" per se — Airspace by Airbus is more ""familiar cutting-edge cozy.""

But still! People power!

With its investment, Premium Aerotec is following the plans of Airbus. According to Peter Sander, Airbus Head of Emerging Technologies & Concepts, Airbus is planning to print one ton of metal powder a month in 2018. Accordingly, additive manufacturing production and processes should be consistently promoted and expanded through 2018.



Premium Aerotec’s new production hall for 3D metal printing commenced operation on January 20, 2016. This heralded the start of industrial series production of a double-walled pipe elbow in the fuel system of the A400M transport aircraft. These complex parts were previously produced from individually cast parts, which were then welded together to form one assembly. In the hall, two M2 cusing Multilaser machines and one X line 1000R machine from Concept Laser produce 3D parts in the LaserCUSING process. “By the middle of 2016, another X line 2000R will be added. It features what is currently the world’s largest build envelope (800 x 400 x 500mm3) in the field of powder-bed-based laser melting and is also equipped with 2 x 1000W lasers,” says Gerd Weber, site manager in Varel.

Airbus touts 400-seat 'A350-8000' jetliner - CNBC,"Fri, 04 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDMvMDQvYWlyYnVzLXRvdXRzLTQwMC1zZWF0LWEzNTAtODAwMC1qZXRsaW5lci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"watch now

Airbus is seeking airline support for a new 400-seat jetliner provisionally dubbed the A350-8000 as competition escalates with Boeing over the world's largest two-engined jets, airline and aviation industry sources said.

After talking up the possibility of a new member of its A350 family, the European planemaker has swung into an active pre-marketing phase as it responds to a recent upgrade in the competing Boeing 777. While Boeing has scored successes in the Gulf with its biggest ever twin-engined jet, the 406-seat 777-9, Airbus is expected to aim its design at airlines that do not always require the performance needed for extreme Gulf conditions.

Airbus

""It would have similar capacity and range (as the 777-9) and substantially lower seat-mile costs,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in an interview. ""We are showing it to airlines right now."" The project is the latest move in a game of leapfrog played by Airbus and Boeing over the past decade in the market for big twinjets, valued at about $1.9 trillion over 20 years. It marks a shift in priorities after the oil price collapse eased pressure on Airbus to upgrade its larger four-engined A380, output of which is declining because of slow sales. Two airlines whose feedback could be decisive in whether Airbus launches the new jet are Singapore Airlines and British Airways. Singapore took delivery of its first smaller A350-900 model this week and has long been weighing up the 777-9, while putting pressure on Airbus to offer it a choice. Both airlines declined to comment. Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier was visiting Singapore on Thursday, where a spokesman declined to comment. The A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) family was launched after a string of setbacks in 2006 to compete with Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777. Boeing responded to the all-new jet by upgrading its existing 777 series to include the 777-9, which has outsold the A350-1000 by about 40 percent but has entered a lean period. Boeing has disclosed 306 sales of 777-9s and a similar variant, while Airbus has sold 181 of its A350-1000s. ""It is clearly an airplane that is on its own in the marketplace and the airplane is selling very well,"" Boeing marketing chief Randy Tinseth told the Istat Americas air finance conference, referring to the latest 777 model.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. offers highly realistic Inadvertent Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IIMC) training at its facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. The training is conducted using an AS350 Level B Full-Motion Flight & Mission Training Simulator, but the course is designed to be non-airframe specific, so it applies to all pilots.

The state-of-the-art simulator can be customized to allow for numerous settings and can provide realistic scenarios for all helicopter missions. The complete training program aims to improve safety for all helicopter operations. Pilots learn tools to avoid getting into IIMC, but also how to initiate a proper recovery if such conditions are encountered.

“IIMC training is about teaching pilots how to react and improve their margin of safety if they get into deteriorated weather conditions and low visibility. Airbus Helicopters Inc. offers IIMC training to operators of all type helicopters as part of its strong commitment to improving safety in our industry,” said Anthony Baker, Vice President of Customer Support.

“It was eye-opening, to say the least,” said Capt. Frank Peck of the Nebraska State Patrol, after completing the IIMC course. “I don’t want to be a statistic. Any training that could save my life is worth it. Whether you are a brand new pilot or have been flying for years, this is worth your time.”

Airbus let the Web dictate the look of its new futuristic planes - TNW,"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV4dHdlYi5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYWlyc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Web is where chaos lives and sometimes, just sometimes, that can be a good thing.

There have been countless viral articles recently that speculated about the planes of the future – where we might have glass bubbles on top of the aircraft or one with no windows, just screens giving an uninterrupted view of the world outside.

Well, these ideas, as innovative as they are, probably won’t become reality anytime soon but Airbus has just revealed its plans for its new aircraft cabins and admitted that its designers used the viral posts to learn what people really wanted from a plane.

Called Airspace, the new cabin is in development and Airbus is hoping it will give passengers a sense of more space, comfort and inspiration on their journeys.

Set to launch on the manufacturer’s new A330neo aircraft in 2017, it’s offering lots of extra space, including wider seats as standard, no control boxes under seats for the in-flight entertainment system, which means it’s all open for you to stretch your legs.

The planes will offer improved built-in broadband connectivity that’ll allow passengers to use their phones and tablets as normal, even making calls and sending and receiving text messages.

The layout and design of the cabin has been made more modular so each airline can customize the layout of their planes, which should mean wider aisles that aren’t taken over by lavatories and trollies.

The overall design offers more space for you and your luggage, more room to walk around and actually enjoy the surroundings on your journey and not be completely disorientated when you land, thanks to better environmental controls and changeable mood lighting.

Being able to stay connected with the ground below via Wi-Fi and now making calls and texts from 35,000 ft makes flying a less daunting experience for anyone who’s nervous. If it gets a little bumpy or you’re feeling anxious, you can now call your friend for a distraction or get lost on Twitter for a while.

Every airline that purchases the new aircraft from Airbus will have the option to customize it as they see fit so here’s to hoping they end up looking something like the concept images.

First of two H215 (formerly AS332L1e) to be delivered this year. Existing AS332 L1 fleet to be retrofit to H215 configuration. Operating in demanding conditions for SAR missions.



Louisville, Kentucky (USA) – Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first of two H215s to join the Finnish Border Guard fleet, announced today at the Heli Expo Trade Show, where an H215 can be visited on the static display.



The first H215 arrived in Finland on February 28 following a training session at the Airbus Helicopters headquarters in Marignane, France. The second is set to arrive upon completion of a second training session in April. More than 140 flight hours will be performed during the trainings.



The Finnish Border Guard already operates three AS332 aircraft and has in addition signed a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) HCare contract to retrofit these AS332s to the new H215 multirole configuration. The H215s will be used to perform Border Security and Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) duties from the Turku and Helsinki bases. The Air Patrol Squadron of the Finnish Boarder Guard carries out more than 4,000 flight hours annually, 1,400 of which in their Super Pumas.



“Finland is the 8th largest country in the European Union but the most sparsely populated, with large sea areas and forest terrains and, due the northern location, very challenging weather conditions for SAR operations,” said colonel Antti Pesari at the Finnish Boarder Guard. “The H215’s avionics and autopilot combined with its capability to provide excellent performance in day or night operations are the reason why we are excited to have it join our fleet.”



The H215 is a twin-engine, versatile, economic and robust helicopter that combines advanced avionics and a reliable platform for rugged multi-mission capabilities. It offers long range capabilities, power, speed, a large useful payload and very good lifting performance in hot and high environments. Both EASA and FAA certified, the aircraft is equipped with the latest, most modern technologies meeting the latest safety requirements of the market. This includes a glass cockpit and the renowned 4-axis autopilot used on the H225, which provides flight envelope protection, unrivalled precision, and stability in even the harshest operating conditions.



“The H215 a highly performing helicopter that also offers a very innovative and flexible cabin,” said Marie-Agnes Vève, Senior Vice President of the Super Puma programme at Airbus Helicopters. “This helicopter represents a new and modern business concept, offering a standardized equipment definition, therefore providing customers with a smart choice when it comes to a specific kind of mission need.”



The H215 is tailored for a full range of missions, including: utility airlift with internal and external loads, passenger transportation; law enforcement and search & rescue missions; firefighting and medical evacuation; and peace-keeping and humanitarian deployments.

Airspace by Airbus Is a Plane Cabin That Uses Design Tips Crowdsourced From Real Customers - Yahoo News,"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYWlyc3BhY2UtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lLWNhYmluLXVzZXMtMTYxNTAwODMxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airplane manufacturer Airbus has released designs for its new cabin called Airspace by Airbus that'll debut in the company's 2017 A330neo plane, according to Mashable. Instead of basing the cabin off what the airlines want, the Airspace by Airbus was designed using crowdsourced suggestions and feedback by real customers over social media and online.

Airbus made the shift because it finally caught on that sites like TripAdvisor and SeatGuru are allowing people to publicly share and rate their airplane experience.

""Today we're reaching out to the passengers who fly on the aircraft,"" Kiran Rao, executive vice president of strategy and marketing, said, Mashable reported. ""Today they are making big decisions based on product, and the experience that they have. So we listen to our customers and our customers' customers.""

The customers' customers are the customers of the airlines, also known as us. However, the airlines do get the final say in the end.

The airy open cabin's improvements focuses on two important flying experiences: storage and legroom, according to a press release. The cabin is slated to have 18-inch seats and bigger overhead bins instead of below-seat storage to provide more lovely legroom. There'll also be LED ambient lighting and wider aisles.

The plane will also have ""improved built-in broadband connectivity,"" so that fliers can use their phones or laptops with greater functionality, Refinery29 reported.

""I mean, if you're a passenger, what else do you care about other than the cabin?"" François Caudron, senior vice president of marketing, said, according to Mashable.

news by Alasdair Whyte 30 March 2016 Print this page

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police has been given the approval to buy a new Airbus H145, with delivery targeted for March 2017. The new helicopter will operate in a search and rescue (SAR) role and replace one of two HH-1H helicopers which date back to the early 1970s. The Metropolitan Police committee on fiscal affairs approved the purchase of the new helicopter on Monday morning, after more than a year of discussions, according to reports.

This will be the first twin-engined helicopter operated by the police department. The unit’s current fleet consists of four MD530Fs and one Bell 407, alongside the two Hueys. The Air Support Unit operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and flies 6,000 hours annually.The department said it averages 160 rescues each year.

Department chief finance officer Rich Hoggan told local news outlets that the price of $9.6M, including spares and training, is being partially offset by $1.6M from the sale of an existing aircraft, and $2M from a lawsuit settlement. Hoggan is also leading an initiative to seek an increase in fees at Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and Lake Mead National Recreation Area to help support the helicopter SAR operations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998244643211365}",neutral,0.9998244643211365,0

The Airbus Group has submitted the C295W light transport plane to the Indian AIr Force, as part of its teaming agreement with Tata Advanced Systems. The group also proposes different helicopters to be manufactured by Mahindra Defence. At Defexpo Airbus highlights three helicopter models competing to win different Indian programs – H125M Fennec, AS565MBe Panther and EC725 (marketed here as the H225M).

“We use Defexpo to present our plans to produce defense platforms in India and basically ‘build an industrial eco-system’ supporting it in collaboration with local partners. This would involve creation of thousands of local jobs, skilling people, technology absorption, etc.” said Pierre de Bausset, President & Managing Director, Airbus Group India.

The selection process for the C295W medium transport aircraft is ongoing. The aircraft is proven around the world as a tough, reliable and high-performance workhorse with outstanding lifecycle costs and excellent performance on short or unpaved runways. To date, 144 C295s have been delivered out of 165 on order and it is in service in 20 countries.

Airbus is proposing Panther helicopter for the Indian Navy’s Naval Utility Helicopter (NUH) program calling for the deployment of around 100 all-weather capable helicopters on board ships and offshore, on maritime surveillance missions, search and rescue, casualty evacuation, vertical replenishment, offshore patrolling and counter-terrorism.

The H125M Fennec is foreseen for the Indian Army’s and Air Force’s Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter (RSH) need of around 400 units. The H225M is under selection process for the Indian Coast Guard’s 14 shore-based helicopter tender. It will also answer the future requirement of the Indian Navy 120+ Naval Multi-Role helicopters under the (NMRH) program.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999904632568359}",neutral,0.9999904632568359,0

By Sarah Young

LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus unveiled a new cabin brand on Wednesday designed to help cost-conscious airlines carry more passengers on long-haul flights while avoiding additional discomfort.

The move reflects the rivalry between major planemakers to jazz up interiors and give airlines more flexibility on cabins as the industry struggles to capture more traffic without angering passengers.

Airbus said the ""Airspace by Airbus"" brand would debut on its upgraded A330, the A330neo, which is due in service from late 2017, before the new designs are rolled out to other jets.

Airlines will still be able to choose what cabin layout they want but with the new designs an A330neo will on average gain 10 seats compared with the existing A330 model, which can take up to 300 passengers.

Airbus and rival Boeing are vying to add more seats to make their jets more economically attractive for airlines while claiming passengers will not feel the difference, though many consumer groups say cabins feel increasingly crowded.

The trend has produced increasingly bitter industry branding wars in recent years, with each of the world's two largest planemakers accusing the other of sacrificing comfort.

Airbus said by rearranging galley and lavatory space, the extra seats would be added to the A330neo with no reduction in seat width and still with eight seats across each row.

""We are putting more passengers on the same amount of space but because of the cleverness and the way we have designed it we don't have to compromise on comfort,"" Airbus's executive vice president of strategy and marketing Kiran Rao said.

The same set of options will later be available on the long-haul A350 and A380, adding 12 seats and 50 seats respectively, Airbus said.

Adding seats is one way to reduce operating costs per seat, a key industry barometer, alongside changes to the structure of the aircraft itself or more efficient engines.

At the same time, planemakers are increasingly stepping into areas previously jealously guarded by airlines and specialist cabin suppliers by offering eye-catching effects, competing more on cabin experience rather than launching costly new models.

Story continues

Boeing has a cabin brand called Sky Interiors and recently unveiled projections of light and images on ceilings and walls.

Airbus said its new brand would include a quieter cabin and new ambient lighting options as it tries to address the growing importance of cabins on social media, where passengers post reviews and photos, and make decisions based on them.

Analysts also said a standardised palette of cabin options could help to reduce the delays which have plagued the plane cabin industry and threatened some deliveries as airlines demand more and more customised features.

Fabrice Bregier, president of planemaking at Airbus has said French seatmaker Zodiac, which has been dogged by production delays, would not be involved with the A330neo.

Los Angeles Police Department - Airbus,"Tue, 08 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLXBvbGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

The city of Los Angeles covers 1,290 km2 (468 sq mi) cradled in a basin between the Pacific Ocean and the San Fernando Valley to the east. To cover the law enforcement needs of such a vast region, the Los Angeles Police Department need just one type of helicopter: the H125.

From their start in 1869, the Los Angeles municipal police have grown to become one of the biggest policing institutions in the United States. Approximately 10,000 officers and more than 3,000 civilians work to ensure the safety of Los Angeles’ 3.8 million residents.The force’s motto is the famous “to protect and to serve,” known from numerous film and television series featuring the LAPD and the City of Angels. From scenes of the distinctive black-and-white cruisers in high-speed chases, the agency and its officers are at once mythic and very real in the popular imagination. Its sheer size and influence has also allowed the department to bring change to the country as a whole: the nation’s first policewoman was accepted into the LAPD, and the agency was the first to establish a SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) team.Divided into six principal services, the LAPD’s airborne law enforcement program is the Air Support Division (ASD). Their mission: to lend aerial support to ground-based officers, contribute to the safety of agents and residents, reduce the incidence and fear of crime, and perform surveillance and photo flights. Fourteen H125 helicopters comprise the fleet, and are equipped with a spotlight, thermal imaging and moving map systems. In a typical day that might see the fleet on between 16 and 20 patrol flights, two H125 are dedicated full-time to active surveillance.Pilot David Swanson describes the division’s work as one of proactively searching suspicious zones, watching and intervening in criminal areas, and responding to calls. The team, he says, also works a lot of the time for traffic enforcement by keeping watch and stepping in when necessary. Suspicious activity is called into the ground agents.Forty-nine pilots and 25 members of tactical teams – all officer grade – comprise the unit, headed by Captain Alfonso Lopez. Their activities consist primarily of their regular duties under ASTRO (Air Support to Regular Operations). Based at Hooper heliport, the unit also maintains the LAPD’s Special Flights Section (SFS) which, since its start in 1976, has provided critical support in detective and undercover operations, narcotics investigations, and seizure of contraband.“The mission is the same, only the vehicle has changed.” Such is the dictum at the ASD, where its fleets of H125s might be considered patrol cars in flight. With ample power reserves and a small body able to negotiate urban confines, the H125 has allowed the LAPD to invest in a single aircraft type for the long term. “It’s a very good tool for work in law enforcement,” says LAPD chief pilot Kevin Gallagher. “It can transport all necessary equipment like the thermal imaging system and the cameras. It’s very powerful and flexible, which lets us manage an array of missions like patrol, surveillance, transportation and drop-off of tactical teams, and the deployment of aerial teams of elite shooters.”The need for crack shots is the domain of the LAPD’s SWAT team, who are called in for missions requiring a coordinated response, such as barricade/hostage incidents or situations involving a suspect considered to be a significant threat to public safety. “When we’re called for an operation that has a criminal or dangerous element,” Gallagher says. “The H125 serves as a shooting platform for the SWAT team.”“The principal differences,” he adds, comparing the H125 to the ASD’s fleet of earlier aircraft, “Are the power, payload, cockpit configuration and its ability to support the equipment for missions. The H125 is superior in each of these areas.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999936819076538}",neutral,0.9999936819076538,0
Airbus' innovative cable tie solution transitions from the shop floor to the world - Airbus,"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLWFpcmJ1cy1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLWNhYmxlLXRpZS1zb2x1dGlvbi10cmFuc2l0aW9ucy1mcm9tLXRoZS1zaG9wLWZsb29yLXRvLXRoZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ patented, paper-based cable tie solution saves time and money compared to the traditional use of plastic ties

A patented, paper-based Airbus solution that improves the process for installing cables and wires throughout an aircraft is now going global, underscoring the company’s continuing role as an innovation leader.The idea began with Marc Bennion, a long-time Airbus employee working at the aircraft manufacturer’s Broughton, UK facility – which is responsible for assembling wings for all Airbus commercial jetliners, including the new-generation A350 XWB.Bennion was fitting wiring to a wing when he realised that using pliers to snip off the plastic ties – which keep the cables organised – sometimes caused accidental damage. As even very minor damage results in the replacement of an entire cable, this was increasing costs and time spent, as well as causing frustration for Bennion and his colleagues.As an alternative, Bennion proposed the idea of paper ties that could be torn off by hand instead. After experiments with several designs, a prototype was approved and subsequently patented by Airbus UK. “Marc’s name appears on the patent alongside Airbus,” said project leader Maud Didnee. “It proves that every idea matters and that innovation can be about simple ways of making a routine job easier.”The next step was to industrialise the idea, which required a cross-functional, transnational approach. Didnee summarized the situation: “We had an idea from Broughton, UK; a plan to use the ties at Airbus’ Bremen, Germany facility; Airbus’ corporate innovation team providing crucial support from Toulouse, France; and the possibility of a supplier from anywhere.”Airbus ultimately chose to partner with Gravic, a supplier from the south of France, and concluded a licensing agreement under which Airbus will receive 15 per cent of the sale price of the paper ties – which will be available on the open market. Added Maud: “The price for each tie is tiny, but sales should be high enough to repay development costs in a year.”Among the applications already planned for Airbus’ cable tie solution is the company’s A350 XWB jetliner programme.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9941798448562622}",neutral,0.9941798448562622,0
MAJOR MILESTONE: First Alabama-made Airbus A320 takes to the skies - Yellowhammer News,"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8veWVsbG93aGFtbWVybmV3cy5jb20vZmlyc3QtYWxhYmFtYS1tYWRlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXRha2VzLXRvLXRoZS1za2llcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

MOBILE, Ala. — The first ever made-in-Alabama Airbus A320 took off this morning on a successful test flight from Mobile. The three-hour journey began shortly after 9:30 AM CST at the Mobile Aeroplex, the site of Airbus’ $600 million U.S. manufacturing facility.

“We’ve come to an exciting milestone in the production of any aircraft, but this one is particularly special,” said Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility. “The Mobile team has worked hard, and I’m proud that their skill and talent have brought us to this moment. Together we are fulfilling the promise we made to the city of Mobile, the state of Alabama, and the Gulf Coast region—we’re creating a new center of commercial aircraft production in the U.S. This is just the first of many aircraft to come.

The A320 is in widespread use around the globe, with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles. It is capable of flying routes ranging from short European commuter sectors and charter operations to coast-to-coast U.S. flights, and more.

The A320 typically seats 150 passengers in a two-class cabin – or up to 180 in a high-density layout for low-cost and charter flights. As a result of an optimized cabin space and increased exit limits, the A320neo new engine option accommodates 165 passengers in two classes or up to 189 in a high-density configuration.

The passenger jet sported the colors of its eventual owner: JetBlue Airways. Airbus plans to deliver the aircraft tested today to JetBlue later this spring from the Alabama facility. Other A321s, destined for American Airlines, are already being assembled at the Mobile Aeroplex production center, which currently has around 300 workers.

By 2018, Airbus says the Alabama manufacturing facility will produce 40 to 50 A320 family aircraft per year, supporting around 1,000 jobs.

RELATED: Airbus expansion could lead to Alabama aerospace boom

“The initial test flight of the first Alabama-made Airbus passenger jet is another exciting chapter in the partnership that Alabama has developed with Airbus,” said Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“This is an inspiring accomplishment for the skilled workforce at the company’s Alabama manufacturing facility, and we know that there are many more impressive developments to come as Airbus ramps up production at the Mobile Aeroplex facility.”

Alabama landed the Airbus facility due to its ‘Right-to-Work’ laws and friendly business climate. “By assembling the planes with nonunion American workers, and in using dollars, Airbus also stands to reduce production costs,” the New York Times wrote at the time.

“When we narrowed it down to the finalists, Alabama to us was the most business-friendly state we could find,” Airbus Group Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Allan McArtor said. “We found in Alabama a willingness to work with us, a willingness to train our employees, proven history with the automobile industry and the aerospace industry that was already in Alabama, and a state and local government that was going to be our partner.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.997417688369751}",positive,0.997417688369751,1
Airspace by Airbus: Airline Cabins Reimagined - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy9jYWJpbnMtcmVpbWFnaW5lZC1haXJzcGFjZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last Wednesday, I attended the London unveiling of “Airspace by Airbus“- the European aircraft maker’s bold strategy to create a distinctive cabin brand that it hopes will represent the pinnacle of passenger comfort and aircraft operational performance.

I must confess to being perplexed by what Airbus could possibly display in the tiny Searcys space on the top floor of the Gherkin building, especially on a cold and grey London morning. Luckily, Airbus had quite a bit of colorful things to show off and I was intrigued on what Airspace was all about and when we might start seeing it on actual Airbus aircraft.

Upon arrival, we were whisked up to the 39th floor, offered breakfast canaps, juice, and coffee, then ushered to our seats by the friendly Airbus PR team. Following a respectful round of applause in solidarity for the very recent terrorist atrocities in Brussels, Dr. Kiran Rao (EVP Strategy and Marketing), Ingo Wuggetzer (VP, Cabin Marketing), and Francois Caudron (Senior VP, Marketing) took to the stage to introduce Airspace by Airbus.

Airbus has generally focused its marketing on aircraft performance and efficiency – the usual pitch to airlines eager to manage their cost base so vigorously. Why, then, would the aircraft manufacturer care so much about the look and feel of the interior? This is traditionally the domain of the airlines, many of whom manage their branding equally vigorously. Well, Airbus intends to begin tapping directly into passenger sentiment. And not just the premium passengers, but the three billion economy class ticket holders who take to the skies each year, and tell the rest of the world about it on social media.

BONUS: Airbus Announces Details of the A330neo + Photos

Airbus has long been proud to offer an 18-inch seat width as the the factory preset (taking a swipe at 17.2″ and 16.9″ respectively), however Airspace seeks to go further by creating the perfect cabin space as the default setting. Airspace puts economy passengers fully front and center (for design purposes, of course, not in the aircraft) in accordance with what Airbus calls, the four pillars of Airspace: Comfort, Ambiance, Services, and Design.

%CODE1%

Now, I could regale you with an in-depth analysis about what those four pillars mean to Airbus, including the perception of greater space, the ergonomic design, the clever use of mood lighting, and the quietest cabin in class. The video above lets you watch the presentation video for yourself. As the Zohan would say, it is silky-smooth. Impressive.

Like most of the journalists there on the ground, I was more interested in why this strategy was being launched with the A330neo’s arrival in 2017, and not with the earlier A350 XWB, and more importantly, how this would sit with airlines’ own cabin strategy, especially with the growth of cabin “densification.”

I asked Airbus Head of Architecture & Industrial Design Paul Edwards why Airspace had not been launched with the A350, an aircraft that had been given as much attention in the opening presentations as the A330neo. He said that many of the Airspace design principles had already been mapped out on the A350, but that they had not considered marketing them the under a label with which consumers could identify.

BONUS: Taking the Qatar Airways Airbus A350 XWB Delivery Flight

The A330neo’s entry into service in 2017 provides the perfect lead-in time to support Airspace and build brand awareness. Nevertheless, as Dr. Rao had earlier said in his presentation, “I am keen for people to start realizing that it is an ‘Airspace’ cabin rather than it being an A350 or an A330 one.”

So will airlines respond to consumer demands for an Airspace-equipped fleet as standard (both in wide-body and eventually narrow-body aircraft), if the Airspace campaign gains traction? Is Airbus treading on airlines’ livery-colored toes and will Airspace cause confusion, or simply fade into the background?

Francois Caudron, SVP Marketing, was coy in his response to a small group of us at the end of the morning. He recognized that the look and feel of the cabin will essentially be defined by the airline and, with a palette of 16 million colors to choose from, passengers will certainly know on which airline they are flying. However, requested changes to the fundamentals of Airspace will be a matter of (no doubt heavy) negotiation between Airbus and its clients.

In the film, they unfortunately only show business class seats. I think that’s a pity because the message that Airbus most definitely sought to deliver was that it was all about the comfort of those in “cattle class.” To be fair, they did not shy away from the fact that 9-, 10-, and even 11-abreast configurations (on board the A380) would, on some level, present a challenge to Airspace.

In appropriate Gallic fashion, it reminded me of Jean-Paul Sartre’s famous quote that “hell is other people.” And, more to the point, Prince Philip’s gaffe in 2002 saying that, “If you travel as much as we do, you appreciate the improvements in aircraft design of less noise and more comfort, provided you don’t travel in something called economy class, which sounds ghastly.” The virtual reality headset tour (because they weren’t about to lug a mock-up A330 cabin interior all the way to the top of the Gherkin – the mock-up will be on display at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg next month) was fun and painted a different picture.

I am generally aircraft manufacturer-agnostic. I do not subscribe to the Boeing vs. Airbus debate. I love the 747 “Queen of the Skies” as much as I do the A380. That said, how the other manufacturers respond to Airspace may become a matter of (heated) debate. Overall, I think Airspace is a shrewd, long-term move on the part of Airbus. It’s a seemingly nonchalant gimmick on the surface, but listening to what the traveling public at large wants might prove to be a cunning strategy to retain and cement Airbus’ position in a competitive global market.

The new, trunk-like instrument of the ‘E-nose’ can detect micro-bacterial contamination in every corner of the Space Station. Viktor Fetter (left) and Thomas Hummel from Airbus Defence and Space take samples in an ISS ground module.

The E-nose, an electronic device for detecting microbiological contamination due to bacteria or fungi on board the International Space Station, will in future be used even more ‘flexibly.’ When a Soyuz launcher (TMA-20M) launches from the spaceport in Baikonur (Kazakhstan) on 18 March, it will be carrying new instruments for the E-nose, which was developed by Airbus Defence and Space for the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). These include a 70-centimetre-long flexible gooseneck probe for taking samples.

The flexible probe can sniff for bacterial contamination behind racks and panels and other hard-to-reach places. This trunk is not simply an extension, but rather an exterior part of the instrument. The coaxial system (tube-in-tube principle) contains filters and moisture regulators and can adhere itself to the area being tested. The sampling heads are replaced after each use in order to prevent contamination from the previous measurement.

The E-nose has been on board the International Space Station since the end of 2012 and was qualified during three series of tests. The test results from this phase had to be brought back to Earth on a memory card to be evaluated, however the new elements will in future allow the data to be received and evaluated in near-real time inside the ISS. This would enable direct monitoring of the environment, a concept which is now to be tested in a two-year extended trial with several ISS crews.

"Ruskin gyrocopter pilot flew close to Airbus turbojet, prosecutors say - Tampa Bay Times","Sat, 05 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdXJ0cy9jcmltaW5hbC9ydXNraW4tZ3lyb2NvcHRlci1waWxvdC1mbGV3LWNsb3NlLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy10dXJib2pldC1wcm9zZWN1dG9ycy1zYXkvMjI2ODExNC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The former Ruskin mail carrier who flew a small gyrocopter through protected Washington airspace before landing outside the U.S. Capitol last spring was seconds away from colliding with a Delta flight that had taken off from Reagan National Airport, prosecutors said.

In a court filing Friday, prosecutors said Doug Hughes flew his one-person aircraft almost directly into the oncoming flight path of the 150-person Airbus turbojet last April. Hughes came within 1,400 yards of Delta Flight 1639, while safety rules require aircraft to remain separated by more than 3,000 yards.

""If the gyrocopter had drifted slightly west, or the airline had taken a slightly more easterly path, a collision could have occurred,"" prosecutors said. Such a collision could have been ""catastrophic,"" they added.

Hughes, who agreed to a plea deal in November, is set to be sentenced April 13. Prosecutors are asking for 10 months in prison, arguing that Hughes put countless lives at risk.

Hughes' attorneys say they don't think he should have to serve any more time behind bars, noting that no one was injured and no property was damaged. Hughes spent one night in jail after the stunt, served five weeks in home confinement and had his travel privileges restricted for nearly a year.

Mark Goldstone, an attorney for Hughes, said they will look into the government's claim about the Delta flight. But he questioned why prosecutors are now saying Hughes flew closer to the plane than they previously reported.

Hughes, in a telephone interview with the Washington Post, rejected the allegation. He cited testimony by U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine before a congressional committee last spring that showed that the Delta plane took off at 12:58 p.m., 25 minutes before he landed.

""I was there. It didn't happen,"" Hughes said. ""They said I flew within 1,500 yards. I wasn't within 30 miles of it.""

Hughes pleaded guilty in November to a felony of operating a gyrocopter without a license. The charge carries a potential three years in prison, but prosecutors agreed not to ask for more than 10 months in prison as part of a plea deal.

Hughes has said he was trying to send a political message — in the form of letters to members of Congress — about the need for stronger campaign finance restrictions by flying the aircraft to Washington after taking off from Gettysburg, Pa. He told investigators during an interview after he was arrested that the only way he potentially put lives in danger was if ""authorities overreacted"" and tried to shoot him down.

Hughes' attorneys argue that while Hughes broke the law, prosecutors should not respond in a way that discourages Americans from expressing their grievances about their government.

Prosecutors said Capitol Police officers were in position to shoot Hughes when he landed and that one of the officers had him in his gunsight with a round in the chamber. They noted that Hughes' flight took him less than a mile from Vice President Joe Biden's home, about 175 feet from the Washington Monument and close to other landmarks.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989217519760132}",neutral,0.9989217519760132,0

By Tim Hepher

PHOENIX (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is seeking airline support for a new 400-seat jetliner provisionally dubbed the A350-8000 as competition escalates with Boeing (BA.N) over the world's largest two-engined jets, airline and aviation industry sources said.

After talking up the possibility of a new member of its A350 family, the European planemaker has swung into an active pre-marketing phase as it responds to a recent upgrade in the competing Boeing 777.

While Boeing has scored successes in the Gulf with its biggest-ever twin-engined jet, the 406-seat 777-9, Airbus is expected to aim its design at airlines that do not always require the performance needed for extreme Gulf conditions.

""It would have similar capacity and range (as the 777-9) and substantially lower seat-mile costs,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in an interview on the sidelines of the Istat Americas air finance conference.

""We are showing it to airlines right now.""

The project is the latest move in a game of leapfrog played by Airbus and Boeing over the past decade in the market for big twinjets, valued at about $1.9 trillion over 20 years.

It marks a shift in priorities after the oil price collapse eased pressure on Airbus to upgrade its larger four-engined A380, the output of which is declining because of slow sales.

Two airlines whose stance could be decisive in whether Airbus launches the new jet are Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and British Airways (ICAG.L).

Singapore took delivery of its first smaller A350-900 model this week and has long been weighing up the 777-9.

Both airlines declined to comment.

In Singapore, where Airbus' planemaking president, Fabrice Bregier, stopped over on Thursday after a China visit, a company spokesman declined to comment.

The A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) family was launched after a string of setbacks in 2006 to compete with Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777.

Boeing responded to the all-new jet by upgrading its existing 777 family to include the 777-9, one of a pair of jets also known as the 777X series.

Story continues

Boeing has sold 306 777X jets. But after an initial burst, sales have hit a lean patch. Airbus has sold 181 A350-1000s.

KEY DECISIONS

The new, bigger A350 would use a derivative of the latest Rolls-Royce (RR.L) Trent XWB planned for the A350-1000. One person briefed on the plans said it would boost thrust to just over 100,000 pounds from the current 97,000.

Airbus believes that would compete well for a large majority of the industry's needs and eclipse the heavier 777X.

Boeing dismissed the proposal.

""We’re not surprised that Airbus is attempting to fill a hole in its product lineup after losing market share to the 777X. At the end of the day, we’ll still have the better airplane,"" Marketing Vice-President Randy Tinseth told Reuters.

Some analysts said a key to the project would be how easily Rolls-Royce could expand a full slate of projects, even without pushing performance to the limits needed by Mideast carriers.

""This sounds like they are making a virtue of its lack of hot-and-high performance compared to 777-9 when maybe it’s the case that Rolls can’t afford, or doesn’t want to, do a much bigger and substantially new engine,"" said Nick Cunningham of UK-based Agency Partners.

One engine expert estimated the upgrade could cost half a billion dollars and require a bigger fan and new materials.

Rolls-Royce was not immediately available for comment.

To give the new jet enough capacity and range, Airbus would boost the maximum takeoff weight to just over 319 tonnes from 308 tonnes on the A350-1000, the person briefed on the plans said.

But it would sacrifice some range compared with the 8,000-mile A350-1000.

Airbus says it has not made a final decision on whether to launch a new A350 and will provide an update at the Farnborough Airshow in July.

It has been weighing what to call the new member of the A350 XWB family, reflecting deeper decisions on market positioning that can affect billions of dollars in sales.

It needs to strike a balance between protecting sales of the A350-1000, by emphasizing what is new, without weakening its long-held mantra of commonality between related aircraft.

Until now, the possible new model was widely known in the industry as the A350-1100, continuing a sequence from the 276-seat A350-800 to the 315-seat A350-900 and 366-seat A350-1000.

Sources now say it is being pre-marketed with a surprise new identity, the A350-8000, although a final decision has yet to be taken. An earlier working title was A350-1000 XL.

Leahy confirmed Airbus was reluctant to call it A350-1100.

""You don't want it so close to the 1000 that it is an either-or decision. You have the 1000 and another airplane, with equal gaps of 40 seats between the 900 and 1000 (models), and then whatever this becomes.""

Eight is a number widely used by planemakers and is seen as a symbol of success in a key battleground for sales: Asia.

""Eight is a very nice number out in Asia, but we are not going to comment until we launch the program,"" Leahy said.

If the name is confirmed, Airbus will be hoping to bury any association with the last jet to use the 8000 model code: a VIP version of its A340, only one of which was ever built.

Dartmouth-Hitchcock Advanced Response Team (DHART), an air medical transport services provider for Northern New England, has contracted with Airbus Helicopters Inc. for the purchase of one H135-series helicopter.

With bases in Lebanon and Manchester, N.H., DHART provides air ambulance services throughout New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut.

DHART operates more than 1,400 missions per year with two EC135 aircraft equipped with the latest IFR (instrument flight rules) avionics and medical technology. The new aircraft, which will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2016, will replace an older EC135, which will be transitioned to a dedicated backup role. Metro Aviation of Shreveport, La. will operate and provide aviation services for the new DHART aircraft.

DHART’s new H135-series helicopter will be outfitted with the latest avionics technology – the Garmin GTN 750, a fully integrated GPS/NAV/COMM multifunction avionics display system. This feature-rich system provides terrain mapping, air traffic viewing, satellite weather reporting and detailed geo-referenced charting.

The state-of-the-art technology will allow DHART to maximize use of their Helicopter Low-Level IFR Enroute and Approach Structure to serve 30 hospitals in New Hampshire and Vermont in poor weather conditions. The new technology provides the pilot and crew with superb situational awareness and current data to enhance the already efficient and safe IFR transport system.

“We chose the H135-series because it fits our mission profile for outstanding performance in our operating environment,” said Kyle Madigan, Program Director of DHART.

“Northern New England consists of challenging mountain terrain and coastal communities. We needed a helicopter that offers maximum maneuverability and safety in the areas we service, while providing the high- and low-altitude performance margins needed to accomplish our mission of saving lives.”

“DHART purchased its first EC135 from Airbus Helicopters over 17 years ago and was the first to operate a single pilot IFR EC135 in the nation,” said Treg Manning, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Airbus Helicopters, Inc. “DHART’s decision to add a new H135-series aircraft to their air medical fleet is a strong endorsement for Airbus Helicopters, and also for the proven safety track record and exceptional performance of the H135/EC135 family of aircraft.”

Airbus Helicopters’ H135-series rotorcraft is the twin-engine platform of choice among air medical service providers due to its performance, safety features, operator efficiency and cabin flexibility.

The H135/EC135 family accounted for nearly 60 percent of U.S. air medical service helicopter deliveries in the last decade. H135-series options include a wide range of dedicated air medical and EMS interiors that provide ample room for equipment, medical crew, and single- or dual-patient transport.

In-flight intensive care stations (including resuscitation functionality), incubators and hygiene-convenient flooring can be installed in the cabin. The Fenestron tail rotor and rear-fuselage clamshell doors offer a safe environment for loading and unloading patients.

Having actively participated in the A350 XWB programme’s design and definition in close collaboration with Airbus, Singapore Airlines is equipping its aircraft with the carrier’s newest-generation cabin products to provide maximum comfort for passengers, making the most of the A350’s Xtra-wide cabin.

The A350 XWBs ordered by Singapore Airlines are the A350-900 version, with the 67 aircraft being acquired to include seven having ultra-long range capability for flights of up to 19 hours. This will enable the carrier to resume non-stop service to the U.S. – ranked among the world’s longest routes without a stopover – which previously were performed by Singapore Airlines’ Airbus A340-500s.

Singapore Airlines has a long relationship with Airbus, having introduced the cornerstone A300 into the carrier’s service in February 1981; followed in November 1984 by the shorter-fuselage, longer-range A310-200 version. In February 2004, Singapore Airlines inaugurated its first A340-500 service by setting a non-stop commercial flight record from Singapore to Los Angeles, subsequently bettering this record in June 2004 with non-stop Singapore-Newark flights.

The carrier marked another airline industry milestone in October 2007 by inaugurating the world’s first A380 commercial flights, and expanded its Airbus fleet in January 2009 with the A330-300’s introduction.

Today, Singapore Airlines has all members of Airbus’ in-production widebody jetliner family in its inventory: the A330, A350 XWB and A380.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9454606175422668}",neutral,0.9454606175422668,0
Upgraded Puma fleet reaches 10000 flight hours - Airbus,"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLXVwZ3JhZGVkLXB1bWEtZmxlZXQtcmVhY2hlcy0xMDAwMC1mbGlnaHQtaG91cnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

The Royal Air Force’s fleet of Pumas reached the 10,000 flight hour mark in February. Under the direction of the Puma Life Extension Programme, a landmark in fleet renewal programs, the helicopters have been upgraded to new-generation standards and are now operating in the U.K. and on overseas deployments.

In 2008, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) was faced with a perfect storm: a financial crisis rocked the world just when budget constraints and the high operational tempo in Iraq and Afghanistan were placing a heavy toll on the U.K.’s military rotary wing fleet. At the same time, the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) aging AS330 Puma helicopters were set to go out of service. With few alternatives to replace them, retiring the Puma fleet put the nation’s rotary wing capability into a vulnerable position.Through its offices in the U.K., Airbus Helicopters approached the MoD with a proposal for a Puma upgrade that would cost significantly less than investing in a new fleet and which could be delivered in less time: the Puma Life Extension Programme (LEP). This proposal involved carrying out a major retrofit of the RAF’s Puma AS330 BA helicopters that would equip the aircraft with modern 21st Century capabilities. “The British MoD was one of the first defence organisations to consider the significant upgrade of older aircraft rather than buying new,” says Ian Morris, Head of Defence for Airbus Helicopters U.K. “In terms of providing a cost effective solution, their decision, which had many detractors, could be described as visionary.”The LEP, initially planned for 28 aircraft, had to be cost-effective to ensure affordability by British taxpayers. As the capability to be delivered was refined, the fleet number dropped to 24, partly because, thanks to the upgrade, the Pumas’ life would be extended while greatly improved fuel efficiency, weight and operational capabilities would allow the RAF to use fewer aircraft to perform the same missions.Four initial helicopters were sent to Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France to aid in the design, early upgrade and flight-testing of a prototype. The remaining 20 Pumas were sent to Airbus Helicopters Romania and upgraded according to the French design specifications. “A crucial aspect of this program was that Romania had both built and maintained more AS330s than anyone else in the world,” says Simon Heath, program manager for the Puma LEP. “They were considered to be the centre of excellence for the aircraft type, and the most cost effective solution.” The helicopters then returned to Airbus Helicopters U.K. for final completion and installation of U.K. specific avionics. The first deliveries were made to the RAF in 2012; all 24 are now in the Air Force’s hands.The advantages over the older model are myriad. “When we stripped all the wiring out and put in modern avionics, we saved about 250 kilograms. We replaced that with additional fuel carrying capacity,” says Heath. A fifth fuel tank was coupled with a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption, thanks to two new Makila 1A1 engines, leading to a considerably increased operating range and nearly double the payload. The more powerful engines mean the Puma has an increased maximum all-up mass, offering more disposable mass, which can be delivered in the most demanding of environmental conditions for use in either fuel or troops. Safety is also significantly enhanced with advanced avionics, and the latest 4 axis digital autopilot, which allows for ‘carefree handling’ to free up the pilot’s capacity to ‘fight the aircraft’ more effectively. The on-board systems are extremely effective in allowing operations to continue safely in limited visibility conditions such as ‘brown outs’ during desert landings.In a relatively short time frame, the Puma 2s began operations, thanks in large part to the partnership between the MoD, the RAF and Airbus Helicopters. Working in close cooperation to cover all operational requirements, the manufacturer was instrumental in helping the Ministry achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the Puma 2 fleet in February 2015. Together with Airbus Helicopters Romania and Vector Aerospace, a team working at RAF Benson completed modifications and maintenance. Three weeks later, ahead of schedule and to cost, the Puma 2s were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation TORAL, NATO’s training and support mission.It quickly became the backbone of the UK’s Afghan operations; to date, shortly after achieving Full Operating Capability in January 2016, the RAF has flown over 10,000 flight hours in the upgraded Pumas. “The abiding comment you get about the Puma 2 from the crews is that it’s ‘awesome’,” says Heath.The Puma Mk2 has been embraced by U.K. crews and has become the hero of the country’s military helicopter fleets. “The Puma Mk2 is a fantastic aircraft that has already proven itself incredibly capable in operations in Afghanistan. While it may still look like the original Puma Mk1 to the untrained eye, the leap in capability has been profound and has made a real difference to the operational output of the Puma Force. The achievement of 10,000 flight hours highlights the remarkable commitment and excellent teamwork by the squadron personnel, Airbus Helicopters and the project team amongst many others,” says Group Captain Simon Paterson, the UK’s Puma Force Commander.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9949758052825928}",neutral,0.9949758052825928,0
HELI-EXPO: Airbus Helicopters launches HForce common weapons system - Flightglobal,"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaS1leHBvLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1sYXVuY2hlcy1oZm9yY2UtY29tbW9uLXdlYXBvbnMtc3lzdGVtLzExOTgxNC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has unveiled a common weapons system for its range of civil-derived military helicopters, giving operators an affordable and incremental upgrade path.

In development for the last two years, the new system – dubbed HForce – will initially be available on the H225M, with a number of integration milestones already passed, says Philippe Kohn, operational marketing manager at the manufacturer.

So far ballistic weapons have been added to the 11t-class platform, including an FN Herstal 12.7mm machine gun, Nexter 20mm cannon and 70mm unguided rockets. Live test firings as part of a qualification campaign will take place later this year.

Integration of guided weapons will be complete by year-end, adds Kohn.

Key to HForce is the use of a common Rockwell Collins Deutschland mission management system across the three helicopters initially enrolled in the programme: the 2.5t H125M, the medium-class H145M, and the heavy H225M.

This will allow operators to order the helicopter in a baseline configuration without weapons, yet still retain the ability to easily upgrade them.

Airbus Helicopters

“Incremental means you will buy the helicopter you need when you can afford it because we can come back to plug and play weapons on it,” says Kohn, who describes the solution as a “Swiss Army knife”.

He says: “Even if you buy Option Zero [on the H125M] your neighbours know you will be able to transform it into a light attack helicopter very quickly.”

Ballistic weapons can be fired by the pilot alone, using his helmet-mounted sight display, or with the addition of an electro-optical/infrared targeting sensor – initially the L-3 Wescam MX-15/20 – the co-pilot can effectively act as a gunner. Guided weapons would also be controlled by the gunner.

“For the first time on such a commercial helicopter we can split the workload in two… just like on an attack helicopter,” says Kohn.

Around eight potential nations are “deeply interested” in acquiring new helicopters equipped with HForce, he says. The H225M being utilised for flight testing is a customer model, taken from the line early in anticipation of a three- or four-unit order.

Airbus Helicopters

Two additional countries are keen on a retrofit programme. This is mainly focussed on the installation of the new mission computer and electrical systems.

Air-to-ground guided missiles will be available on request, although the customer will fund the integration work. And, depending on customer demand, air-to-air missiles could be provided later.

“But the key is to gather all these things into an incremental weapons system. If a customer comes and asks us for something different – a specific machine gun, for example – then we will have to develop it,” says Kohn.

“But we wanted to be realistic. We have the people who have the knowledge to integrate on all kinds of helicopters these kinds of weapons.”

Larger overhead bins. Greater comfort. These are all aircraft cabin features that Airbus continues to tout, most recently through the launch of the Airspace cabin interior concept just last week. And yet, despite all the talk, the 11-abreast A380 layout is once again up for discussion and Airbus is pushing it, arguably more than ever, in a presentation given to investors on the very same day that Airspace was unveiled. The outlook for coach (and even some premium) customers will have dimmed a bit, if airlines warm to these ideas.

It is no secret that the A380 has stagnated in the market of late. Airbus is working hard to expand the order book for the super jumbo and it continues to explore ways to improve space utilization on board; more seats means better margins and the airframer knows that it must convince airline customers of even better economics to sell the type. A re-engined “neo” model seems unlikely as does a stretch configuration and so the company is looking for ways to make the existing space “more efficient” and more profitable.

In an investor presentation released last week the company highlighted many “cabin enablers” to help boost the revenue potential for the type. And, while some of them are truly neutral to the customer, the majority are almost certainly downgrades to the passenger experience (#PaxEx).

It was almost exactly one year ago that Airbus presented the A380 11-abreast mockup at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg. That went over about as poorly as one would expect, particularly considering the way in which an 18″ seat width was promised – by narrowing the armrests to increase the measurement while not actually adding more personal space. Airbus is not the only firm making that play, which is unfortunate for all passengers, but in the case of the A380 it is especially unfortunate as it creates an incredibly dense layout with more middle seats – who wants the middle seat of a 3-5-3 configuration? – and also significantly reduced comfort at the windows. At that time, the concept was presented as just an option, something an aircraft lessor or two might be interested in. Today it appears to be key to the company’s drive to convince airlines that the A380 is a profit machine.

As for the rest of the aircraft, things don’t get much better in the premium cabins, either. Airbus is suggesting that some of the other benefits the type offers be removed or reduced to further increase density. On the upper deck, sidewall bins exist today because the sidewall curves in too much to comfortably move the seats closer to the wall. The airframer’s marketing slides call for removing that storage to increase revenue.

Similarly, the company is calling for an increased density in the Premium Economy cabin, at least on the main deck. Currently Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines offer such, both in a 2-4-2 layout. Airbus’ new marketing effort calls for a 3-3-3 arrangement instead. Other airlines offer Premium Economy on the upper deck in a 2-3-2 layout; Airbus does not seem keen to change that, other than suggesting it move downstairs where greater density can be achieved.

There are some ways in which the “cabin enablers” are arguably passenger neutral. A combined crew rest compartment should not adversely affect passengers. And the alternative stair-galley module (currently in development, not actually offerable yet) should mostly be neutral, though it does raise questions about overall galley space and levels of passenger comfort vis-a-vis catering and room to move during the longhaul flights the A380 is built to serve. The Space-Flex galley was also supposed to be passenger-neutral and that has not proven to be the case in reality.

I’ve flown on the A380 with five different airlines, sampling both economy and premium products. I’ve enjoyed each of those flights immensely. But a significant portion of that enjoyment came from the fact that the offering was comfortable, even as 400-500 other people were on the plane with me. I’ve walked through the Emirates two-class A380 with 600+ seats on board and I believe it to be a surprisingly comfortable layout. Going 11-abreast on the main deck and potentially tighter upstairs as well would almost certainly break down that comfort factor.

It is the airlines, of course, which ultimately make the choice; not the airframer. And carriers are constantly looking for ways to shave costs and increase revenues. That’s what a good business does. But if they’re not careful they’ll ultimately ruin the goodwill and positive impression the A380 has created in the industry. Passengers love flying the type, according to Airbus data and feedback on social media. But they love it in the current layouts, not one squeezing 10% more seats on board. Airlines must be very careful on that front as to not destroy the well-earned reputation the type has today.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5306392312049866}",neutral,0.5306392312049866,0

One of America’s leading entrepreneurs, David MacNeil, owner of MacNeil Automotive Products Ltd. in Bolingbrook, Ill., placed an order for an Airbus Helicopters H145 for use with his highly successful company that manufactures the acclaimed WeatherTech automotive products.



MacNeil said the decision to buy the H145 was based on the performance, quality and safety features of the powerful twin-engine aircraft, and his experience as an owner-operator of an

Airbus Helicopters H125.



“This is an outstanding aircraft that will be an extremely useful tool to help in managing our business and enabling us to better serve our customers,” said MacNeil. “And my customer support experience with Airbus Helicopters has been outstanding.”



“We are pleased and honored that an extraordinary entrepreneur like David MacNeil has once again selected an Airbus Helicopters aircraft for his business transportation needs,” said Chris Emerson, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc.



“David’s choice is a vote of confidence in the capabilities of our class leading H145 helicopter and of the ability of the Airbus Helicopters Inc. team to provide him with world-class customer support.”



MacNeil has built a highly successful automotive accessories business. His entire WeatherTech product line, which consists of floor liners, floor mats, cargo liners, side-window deflectors, car covers, license plate frames, mud flaps, pickup truck bed liners, BumpSteps and home/business doormats, is made in America; much of it in the company’s suburban Chicago factory.



The H145 provides a roomy cabin that can seat eight or more passengers. The two Turbomeca Arriel 2E engines, with dual channel FADEC, provide strong performance; they generate 951 shaft horsepower for take-off and allow for substantially improved hover and one-engine inoperative performance, as well as increased max gross weight capability.



The H145 is equipped with the Airbus Helicopters developed Helionix avionics system, including a standard 4-axis digital Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS), for reduced pilot workload and improved situational awareness. A Fenestron enclosed tail rotor dramatically reduces noise levels. The helicopter’s tail boom is constructed of composite materials.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998693466186523}",positive,0.9998693466186523,1
Would a Bigger Airbus A350 Be a Boeing 777X Killer? - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9nZW5lcmFsLzIwMTYvMDMvMTIvd291bGQtYS1iaWdnZXItYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtYmUtYS1ib2VpbmctNzc3eC1raWxsZXIuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The so-called A350-8000 might be more fuel efficient than Boeing's 777-9 -- but that wouldn't make it more popular.

After initially downplaying the idea, Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) executives have started to seriously consider launching an even larger version of the new A350 widebody jet. This new model -- tentatively named the A350-8000 (or perhaps the A350-1100) -- would compete with the 777-9 that Boeing (BA -1.90%) is currently developing.

John Leahy, Airbus' chief salesman, has stated that a stretched A350 would be similar in size to the 777-9 and offer lower unit costs. Even so, Airbus is unlikely to break Boeing's dominance of this 400-seat market segment -- and may not even try.

Airbus warms to the 400-seat segment

At a recent industry conference, Leahy noted that he had initially been skeptical about the potential demand for a plane 40-45 seats larger than the A350-1000. However, as he has spoken to customers in recent months, his opinion has shifted somewhat.

Leahy thinks that some of Boeing's design choices for the 777-9 create an opening for Airbus. For the 777X, Boeing had to meet the exacting specifications of the big Middle Eastern carriers: Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad. These airlines needed a plane with a big wing and very powerful engines in order to take off fully loaded during the summer. (High temperatures reduce aircraft engine performance.)

By meeting these demands, Boeing secured 235 orders for the 777X from these three carriers, mainly for the larger 777-9 variant. However, the 777X's big wing and powerful engines add weight, which hurts its fuel efficiency on shorter flights.

The A350-1000 is significantly lighter than the competing 777-8. That will give it a fuel-efficiency advantage. A larger A350-8000 should have a similar weight and fuel-burn advantage over the 777-9.

Airbus faces a trade-off

The trade-off for having a lighter aircraft is lower range. If Airbus were to stretch the A350 again, it would face a big choice. It could design a significantly larger wing in order to keep the airplane's range in the same ballpark as the A350-1000. However, that would add weight, reducing or eliminating any fuel-burn advantage over Boeing's 777-9.

On the flip side, it could minimize the design changes relative to the A350-1000 to maximize fuel efficiency. That's what Boeing chose to do with the 787-10. The result was an extremely fuel-efficient plane with about 1,200 nautical miles less range than the 787-9 it was derived from.

Airbus is far more likely to choose the second path. Leahy admits that Boeing has won the battle for Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad. Instead, he wants to optimize a stretched A350 for the likes of British Airways and United Continental. But would those airlines necessarily buy a 777-9 rival with better fuel efficiency but shorter range?

The problem is that most airlines want to simplify their fleets. The A350-8000 would be able to cover most long-haul airline routes, but most airlines do operate some flights beyond its likely range. If they need the 777-9's range for some routes, they might be willing to sacrifice some fuel efficiency rather than buying two planes in the same size segment.

It's instructive to note that Boeing has more than three times as many orders for the 787-9 as it does for the larger, shorter-range 787-10. Airbus' A350-900 -- which is similar in size to the 787-10 with more range but somewhat higher fuel burn -- has outsold the 787-10 by a similar margin.

Airbus has fewer than 200 firm orders for the A350-1000 model today. A larger model with less range would probably sell fewer units -- and some of those would be cannibalized from the A350-1000. This casts doubt on whether Airbus will find enough of a market to justify developing a larger A350.

What will Airbus do?

Airbus expects to announce a decision on stretching the A350 at the Farnborough Air Show in July. If it can keep the development costs relatively low, Airbus may go ahead even if the market size seems relatively small.

However, a stretched A350-8000 would hardly be a 777X killer. In addition to having less range, the A350-8000 would probably be about 265 feet long, making it the longest plane in the world by nearly 15 feet. Emirates President Tim Clark recently pointed out that this would complicate ground handling at some airports.

Airbus will also probably have its hands full meeting demand for the A350-900 and A350-1000 until well beyond 2020. As a result, Boeing is likely to maintain its supremacy in the 400-seat airplane market for the foreseeable future.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8569382429122925}",positive,0.8569382429122925,1
