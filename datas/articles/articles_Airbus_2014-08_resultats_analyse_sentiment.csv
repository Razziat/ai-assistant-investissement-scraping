Half time 2014 for Boeing and Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wOC8wNy9oYWxmLXRpbWUtMjAxNC1mb3ItYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The major OEM’s have published their half time 2014 results and we can make an analysis of their half year results together with orders / deliveries and the state of their product lines. We compare Boeing and Airbus on the high end and in a follow up article Embraer and Bombardier on the low end. To make orders and deliveries comparable we include the month of July as the OEMs collected business to be announced at Farnborough mid July.

Boeing had a strong first half 2014. Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) business is now past the initial problems on the 787 program and delivered 48 units January to June 2014 (8 per month) which is the same numbers as for the 777 program. The 737 is now at rate 40 per month with a first half total of 239 deliveries. The 747-8 is at rate 1 with only 6 deliveries and the 767 has stopped as a commercial program with only 1 delivery during the first half year. The commercial deliveries of 342 aircraft drove a 4% increase in company overall revenue and a 5% increase in earnings compared to first half 2013 (both non-GAAP i.e. the core business performance), this despite a Defense, Space and Security side which was down 5% on revenue and down 15% on earnings.

The troubled unit is Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) which is struggling with its 767 tanker program (KC46A charged BMA with $187 million and BCA with $238 million due to increased development costs) and it is also fighting to not have its major military airplane program, the F18, stop 3 years from now from lack of orders. The military aircraft order drought contrasts with BCA where first half orders was 783 aircraft, mainly 737 but also 777X, where Emirates and Qatar confirmed their orders for 200 777X.

In the same period Airbus logged 705 net orders, mainly A320 (732 units) and A330 (29 units) whereas A350 finished January-June with -70 airplanes after Emirates cancellation. The A380 came out at 14 net orders. Airbus deliveries of 303 aircraft for 1H 2014 drove Airbus group’s results with +6% in both revenue and earnings as we reported previously.

Accounting differences

It is important to know that the profitability of Boeing and Airbus can not be compared by these simple numbers. Boeing practices program accounting for their large aircraft programs. In short this means that the total anticipated costs of the project is calculated (development-, tooling-, production- and warranty costs) and spread over the accounting block (the number of aircraft they plan to sell). The average cost per unit in this accounting block is then used as cost of goods sold (the picture shows the principle for production costs), revenue for goods sold is actual net revenue at delivery.

This means that the high up-front costs for the 787 program is deferred and will be consumed little by little as the accounting block of 1300 units is worked through. In contrast the high initial costs of the A380 is already shown in the earnings of Airbus over the last years, as of 2015 when the production costs shall equal the net price of an A380 (according to Airbus) any gains in paid price over actual production and warranty cost will add to the bottom line of Airbus. It is important to understand these differences when one looks at Boeing’s and Airbus earnings. It can seem that Boeing is gaining a first look advantage when the costs of large programs like the 787 are spread out outside the year of the cost being incurred but late in a program it works the other way, it lowers profits when a direct accounting method would have shown higher profits. In essence it is just two different way to look at costs and how these shall be best accounted for in large projects.

Product lines

When comparing the present state of the civil aircraft programs for Boeing and Airbus the following picture emerges:

SINGLE AISLE: Airbus took an early lead with the A320neo but Boeing has done a good job of catching up both in product attractiveness and sales. It is now a dog-fight for every airline sale and whereas the A320 had an initial lead in overall promised efficiency there is, what we can see, nothing separating the two today after Boeing gradually increased the efficiency gain to 14% over the 737NG. The A320 has a slightly wider cabin but the 737 has the Sky Interior which is more attractive to airline passengers then the dated A320 cabin. We see these programs evenly matched with Boeing having the upper hand in the mid range (737MAX8 vs. A320) and Airbus on the high end (A321 vs. 737MAX9).

DUAL AISLE 250 to 300 seats: This has been Airbus turf in the present with the A330 and Boeing’s business going forward with the 787, the 787-9 out-competing Airbus single entry in the range, the A350-800. As the A350 program went into flight test last summer it was clear the A350 had reached a weight increase that made the “cut and shut” A350-800 more than 5 tonnes heavier then the slightly larger 787-9. With this weight deficit our proprietary model showed the -800 could no longer compete with the 787-9. We then modeled an upgrade of the A330 to a neo status with engines from the 787. This was clearly a better proposition and we predicted during autumn 2013 that the A350-800 would have to leave the scene for a revamped A330. We finally put figures on our conviction 29th of December and since then the A330neo got more and more concrete until it was launched at Farnborough as A330-900 (aka A330-300neo) and A330-800 (A330-200neo). Capacity wise the A330-900 vs. 787-9 and the A330-800 vs. 787-8 are more similar then e.g. A321neo vs. 737MAX9 or A320neo vs. 737MAX8, yet still Boeing tries to avoid a direct comparison by pitting the 787-10 against A330-900. The 787-10 has a capacity which is higher than A350-900 and is more than 30 seats larger then A330-900. Our first analysis of the launched A330neo shows it to be close to the 787 in efficiency, close enough so that Boeing now has a more difficult competitor on hand then A350-800 ever was.

—-

If the customers usage of the 300 seat models is mainly within 10 hours missions there is little to choose in per seat efficiency for a 787-9 versus A330-900, for longer missions the 787-9 is the only choice. The 787-9 is more efficient on a trip level by virtue of lower weight but the cabin changes for the A330neo has bought it at least 4 seats, so on a per seat basis it is very close. The A330-800 can fly the same 15 hour sectors as the 787-8 but this cost the -800 in the weight domain and therefore efficiency. Here there is a clearer efficiency difference but not larger than can be fixed by aggressive pricing. It will be an interesting segment to follow with the new lineup.

DUAL AISLE 300 to 400 seats: The competitive landscape is here more complex, there is no single model which is close to the other in payload or range. The entry level contains A350-900, an efficient 315 seater which can fly 15 hour missions. The alternative would be the somewhat larger 787-10 but it will only perform 12 hour missions when outfitted with a realistic cabin and a payload containing any cargo. If your network requirements are within the capabilities of the 787-10 it is clearly more efficient then a A350-900, so much that a A350-900 Regional (a de-papered A350-900 with lower price and due to the lowered max weight lower airport and underway fees) has to be priced aggressively to compete.

—-

The next step up pits the 777-8X versus the A350-1000. The shorter 777-8X has the same passenger capacity as the A350-1000 by virtue of 10 abreast economy and a more efficient door layout then 777-300ER (4 door pairs like the -1000 instead of 5 for the -300ER). It trails the -1000 in cargo volume capacity (-10%) and has slightly lower efficiency as it uses the engines and wing from the larger -9X. Consequently it has the legs to carry the famous 45 tonnes of payload between Dubai and Los Angeles, a long time requirement of Emirates for a 777-300ER replacement. In fact the -8X can carry more but the cargo hold will be full before any weight limits are reached (for cargo with normal densities). The A350-1000 could only fill half the free cargo positions for such a trip, it would be weight limited at around 15 LD3 positions filled out of the 30 which would be free after passenger bags are loaded.

—

The 400 seat segment has only one player today, the 777-9X. By virtue of being the largest twin available with very good economics and payload-range it has sold extremely well since launch last autumn. Up to 1 of August 2014 243 orders are confirmed, adding the 43 777-8X orders brings the 777X program to a record 286 orders within less of a year of launch. This can be compared to 175 orders for the A350-1000 but there many eventual orders are hidden by A350-900 deposits (ref. United’s recent exchange of 787-8 positions for 787-10 deliveries). Still the success of the 777X program should cause concern at Airbus. When the competition was 777-300ER the difference was so large in favor of the A350-1000 that even long time Boeing customers choose the more efficient alternative, now the pendulum has swung the other way and Airbus is working on schemes to convince its -1000 customers to not feel compelled to add the -9X to their fleets. Such schemes involve using the cabin space more efficiently without compromising the 18’’ economy comfort (smart galley and WC solutions etc). We have modeled this and what a stretch A350-1100 would bring, we are convinced a A350-1100 decision will come before long.

VLA segment: There is not much competition in this segment, the market did not accept the 747-8i when the next smaller Boeing model was 777-300ER and this will not improve now when the 777-9X is on the price list. This leaves the A380 as the only alternative for slot restricted hub to hub traffic when a 777-9X can not do the job. If you are Emirates this limitation does not apply, they fill the A38o out of their Dubai hub to more normal destinations. British Airways has now experienced the same customer reactions as Emirates has long known to leverage, when an A380 is available for your trip the passenger selects the cruise ship of the skies in preference to other aircraft, it brings such a difference in comfort. It remains for Airbus to figure out how more airlines shall be convinced that they can fill an A380.

Finnair Reveals Its Cabins for Its New Long-Haul Airbus Fleet - Skift Travel News,"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMDgvMTMvZmlubmFpci1yZXZlYWxzLWl0cy1jYWJpbnMtZm9yLWl0cy1uZXctbG9uZy1oYXVsLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldC_SAV9odHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDE0LzA4LzEzL2Zpbm5haXItcmV2ZWFscy1pdHMtY2FiaW5zLWZvci1pdHMtbmV3LWxvbmctaGF1bC1haXJidXMtZmxlZXQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Finnair respected the best features of the A350XWB by choosing to keep it simple, and roomy. We can only hope other airlines which will fly the A350 will be inspired by this approach.

Just after the A350XWB aircraft touched down at Helsinki Airport for a quick hello, national carrier Finnair announced its interiors cabins for this new aircraft. Finnair is the European launch customer for this new Airbus aircraft model.

Finnair plans to begin service on its first A350s in the second half of 2015, initially serving Shanghai, Bangkok, and Beijing, with Hong Kong and Singapore A350 service to be added in 2016. The airline has placed 11 firm orders and 8 options for A350 aircraft with Airbus, which will form the backbone of the company’s long-haul fleet and drive its expansion plans.

Room, Room, Room & Mood Lighting

Skift toured the A350XWB earlier this year during its Hamburg debut. We noted that it had plenty of room and we hoped airlines would use it well. It’s clear that Finnair felt the same. The airline went out of its way to respect the space and comfort features of the A350’s original design concept, resulting in optimized cabins, which provide passengers the comforts they care about most, and a little something extra to make the travel experience more pleasurable.

Finnair’s new cabin design for its new flagship longhaul product is the brain-child of top Helsinki firm dSign Vertti Kivi & Co, also the designer of Finnair’s new Premium Lounge at Helsinki Airport. The design firm made the most of A350’s bright and spacious cabin features, including large panoramic view windows and comfortable seating arrangements in both classes, Economy (with an Economy Plus section) and Business. We admired the mood-lighting options on the A350 during our walk-through in Hamburg, and Finnair has chosen to make the most of this feature.

“We have worked hard to create a special customer experience onboard the new A350XWB aircraft and are proud to bring Finnish design to Finnair’s passengers,” says designer Vertti Kivi. “Our Space Alive concept means dynamic lighting, colours and moods to suit the time of day, destination or season. For example, when descending in the East the aircraft can be awash in warm orange tones, or surface interiors may glow in fresh blue hues when arriving in Helsinki.”

Welcome to Helsinki, A350! The start of a beautiful friendship, we're sure. #A350XWBTour pic.twitter.com/9TIvDuaFAH — Finnair (@Finnair) August 12, 2014

As the airline states: “Gradual changes in dynamic ambient LED lighting ease customers into a relaxing flight experience and help create a calming and fresh atmosphere.”

For the rest of the new Finnair cabin reveal, we’ll start at the back. The airline gave due consideration to its Economy passengers on this aircraft. Finnair provides a 31-inch seat pitch in Economy, and a 9-abreast configuration: meaning the seats are wider and easier to get in and out of, with a 3+3+3 configuration.

Finnair selected Zodiac Z300 slim-line seats its 208 Economy Class and 43 Economy Comfort seats—which will get comfy headrests, high-quality headphones and four extra inches of leg room. All Economy and Economy Plus seats get an 11-inch touch screen In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system and USB power outlets to keep their devices charged during those long flights.

The aircraft, carrying 297 passengers in all, also includes 46 seats in Business Class in a 1+2+1 layout, giving all Business Class passengers direct aisle access. The airline selected Zodiac Cirrus III seats, which convert to fully flat beds, and gave Business Class passengers a 16-inch touch-screen Inflight Entertainment System loaded with films, TV shows, music and other digital content on demand in numerous languages. Seats in Business Class also come equipped with AC and USB power outlets.

Finnair tells Skift that it is still deliberating on the final selection of IFE and in-flight Wi-Fi suppliers, and will let us know when it’s ready to make that announcement.

“Since Finnair’s founding in 1923, we have had a long history of operations using the most advanced aircraft available,” says Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo. “As the first European operator of the A350 we are proud to carry forward this tradition on behalf of our passengers, whose safety and comfort remain our first priority.”

Beauty of Simplicity

What we love best, is what Finnair didn’t do to these cabins. It didn’t clog up the visual space of what is an otherwise cavernous aircraft with broken lines and colour pollution. Instead, the airline reflected its Nordic nature choosing a light grey colour scheme, which can be cool or warm according to how it plays off the changing lighting effects in the cabin, or the never repeated light selection—straight from mother nature through those nice large windows.

Far from drab, we’ve seen cabins designed in this neutral shade glow like pearls in the sunlight. It is an exquisitely light-friendly color, though it does require special care in cleaning. We have no doubt Finnair’s cabins will have all that shimmer, while keeping the passenger’s eyes at rest with slim lines and hidden minimalist elements. The old design adage, less is more, has been around a while because it is so very true.

Just the right amount “less” is also feature of the A350. The aircraft has an eco-smart design, delivering more than 25 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency and operating cost over the previous generation of aircraft in its class, reducing the carbon footprint of Finnair and its passengers.

And the Upgrades Continue

Finnair has also announced that Economy Comfort will become a feature of all its long-haul flights, not just the A350, with those extra four inches of legroom. Economy Class meals are updated with an additional complimentary mid-flight snack on day-time flights, a new wine selection and—wait for it—Free Bubbly in Economy! Definitely a way to win passengers hearts. Business Class will receive a new amenity kit with “high-quality brand products,” the airline states.

“During the past year we have carried out detailed surveys of nearly 8,000 customers from our key markets in both Europe and Asia,” says Jarkko Konttinen, Finnair’s VP Marketing and Product Development. “With these product updates in tune with customer expectations and desires, we can support our core goal of growing Asian revenue and becoming a preferred airline in travel between Asia and Europe.”

Finnair will also introduce Sky Bistro, offering a wide mix-and-match selection of foods and beverages which combine flavors of Europe and Asia. Meals can be picked out in advance on line, at Finnair.com, or bought onboard in flight. Sky Bistro will be available on nearly all European flights and meals for Business Class are included in the price of the ticket. The coffee, tea and Finnair’s signature blueberry juice will continue to flow freely into your cup, no matter what class you’re flying.

Business Class will convert to fully flat beds on almost all long-haul aircraft. To complete the unique Finnair passenger experience, there is the sauna and new shower suites we wrote about earlier this year at the Finnair Lounge at Helsinki Airport, where passengers can relax prior to take off. Finnair Plus Gold and Platinum members, and other oneworld top tier customers, can enjoy the exclusive new Premium Lounge annex.

Finnair didn’t forget the importance of tech to the travel experience. The airline will roll out a new mobile travel companion application (for iOS in the fall, later for other mobile platforms). The app will give up-to-the-minute flight information, store boarding passes, and can be used to check in, select seats, buy upgrades, and check Finnair Plus point status. Finnair will also be sending special offers to its customers via the app.

Helsinki Steps Up Its Game

The close relationship between Finnair and its home airport, Helsinki, continued today; with Helsinki revealing its ambitious plans for a new future-proofed terminal for 2020:

We already enjoy saunas at the Finnair lounge and yoga classes at the terminal, but the future terminal will have state-of-the-art technology integrated throughout, restaurants and shopping, all to make the travel experience care-free and fun. Which is exactly as it should be.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999847412109375}",neutral,0.9999847412109375,0
Freshly Painted Qatar Airways Airbus A350 - Airline Reporter,"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wOC9mcmVzaGx5LXBhaW50ZWQtcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways and Airbus have released photos of their newly-painted Airbus A350-900XWB. The aircraft has just been released from the paint hangar in Toulouse and is the first to feature the full Qatar Airways livery. Unlike other aircraft, which had a hybrid Airbus & Qatar livery, this one in the airline’s standard grey livery with signature Oryx on the tail – it certainly does look sleek.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said that the airline is currently in the midst of a massive fleet expansion program and the incoming delivery of the Airbus A350 type into the fleet will be a significant milestone for the airline. ’œWe take pride in introducing the latest products and services available to the industry and this new aircraft is a prime example of that. We look forward to offering to our passengers even more choice and variety in the young and modern fleet which we operate to more than 140 destinations across the world.’

With deliveries of the Airbus A350 set to begin later this year, the airline has not yet fully set out the schedule of the initial flights of the A350, but they have announced that it will do short-haul routes around the Gulf region. After that, the A350 is destined to my home country, Australia, where it will start operating on the Qatar to Perth route. This long and thin route is exactly what the Airbus A350, and its competitor the Boeing 787, were designed for.

Qatar has over 80 of the A350 on order from Airbus. With the aircraft completing a round-the-world test flight recently, it is nearing certification. Once certified, Qatar can take the first of their aircraft as launch customer of the type, and usher in a new generation of aircraft. Qatar was also set to receive the first of their A380s this year, however they have been significantly delayed due to issues with aircraft acceptance.

When the A350 enters service with Qatar Airways, it will mean a new aircraft to work out how to get on. Maybe now I will have more of an excuse to go home to Australia again?

What Planes Will Russia Fly If Boeing and Airbus Ditched Over Sanctions? - The Moscow Times,"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1vc2Nvd3RpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA4LzI3L3doYXQtcGxhbmVzLXdpbGwtcnVzc2lhLWZseS1pZi1ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1kaXRjaGVkLW92ZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLWEzODc4N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After the Boeing planes flown by Russia’s first low-cost airline, Dobrolyot, were grounded by EU sanctions in July, Russian officials have revived their efforts to stimulate production of Russian civilian airliners.

Dobrolyot’s plane-leasing agreement with an Irish company was derailed when it was sanctioned for flying to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in March. The move highlights the vulnerability of Russia’s airlines: 90 percent of places flown by Russian airlines are Boeings and Airbuses leased from the West. Most of the major carriers fly to Crimea.

In response, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the defense industry, has championed the transition to domestic airliner designs. Two weeks ago, Rogozin said the government was considering launching a new airline “to ensure regular air travel to Crimea with a domestic fleet.”

Russia’s government and president have lent their weight. President Vladimir Putin proposed earlier this month to restart production of certain Russian airplane designs to be used by Russian airlines. On Wednesday, the government said it would backstop a $400 million loan to help develop Russia’s next-generation MC-21 airliner.

Local airlines opt for Boeing and Airbus jets because they are safer, more reliable, use less fuel and can be easily leased. The Soviet Union was a plane-making powerhouse, but a long funding drought has left Russia’s civil aviation industry weak.

To achieve self-sufficiency in aircraft manufacturing capacity, Russia would have to find domestic alternatives to passenger planes capable of servicing short range routes under 5,000 kilometers, medium-haul routes under 10,000 kilometers, and long-range routes under 15,000 kilometers.

So what will Russians fly in a hypothetical post-Boeing and Airbus world?

The Moscow Times has examined the options.

Ilyushin Il-96

Dzerod / Wikicommons Ilyushin Il-96

The Il-96 is Russia’s only long-range civilian airliner. It is an advanced upgrade of the Soviet Il-86, the only long-range wide-body airliner developed by the Soviet Union. This would be the only viable domestic replacement for the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 airliners that fly internationally from Moscow. The Il-96 is currently operated exclusively by a special division of Aeroflot subsidiary Rossiya Airlines for Russian government flights. Aeroflot no longer flies the aircraft, having put their six Il-96 planes sale in April 2014, according to business daily Vedomosti.

President Vladimir Putin’s “Air Force One” analogue is a specially modified Il-96.

Unit Cost: $40 million-$50 million. The A330 costs about $220 million, and the Boeing 777 costs anywhere from $260 to $320 million.

Seating Capacity: 240-350 passengers, depending on the model and seat configuration. The Il-96 stacks up well to the Airbus A330, which can typically seat about 250-350 passengers. The Boeing 777, which has several variants with longer bodies, can fit anywhere from 300 to 500 passengers.

Number Produced: Only 29 Il-96 planes have been constructed since its introduction in 1993, while its Boeing and Airbus rivals have rolled out over 1,000 of their respective models.

Range: 10,000-15,000 kilometers, depending on payload and fuel load. This is on par with the range of both the A330 and Boeing 777.

Sukhoi Superjet 100

Anton Bannikov / Wikicommons Sukhoi Superjet 100

The Superjet 100 is built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in collaboration with U.S. and European partners to compete in the medium-haul airliner market. The 110-seat plane entered commercial service in 2011.

Though Russian-built, the Superjet 100 is heavily invested with Western technology. It was developed as part of an international joint-venture between the Sukhoi design bureau and several Western aerospace firms. This makes the Superjet potentially vulnerable to future sanctions. Last week, United Aircraft Corporation, which owns Sukhoi, said it was expanding production of the Superjet, denying that tensions had any impact on supplies of foreign components.

Though sales have been slow, the Superjet has found buyers both inside and outside Russia.

The Superjet’s primary competitors are the upcoming Canadian Bombardier CS100 jet and Brazil’s Embraer E-Jet.

Unit Cost: $35 million. A Bombardier CS100 costs $62 million, while E-Jets cost anywhere from $28 to $47 million.

Seating Capacity: 110 passengers. The CS100 seats the same, and the E-Jet series can fit 80-110 passengers depending on the model.

Number Produced: 68 have been built so far, with 25 of them rolling off the assembly line last year. Sukhoi says it plans on building 40 in 2014, and 50 in 2015. Production of the CS100 has yet to begin, as the plane is still being tested. Embraer has produced more than 1,000 E-Jets.

Range: 3,000-5,000 kilometers, depending on the model. The maximum range of a CS100 will be about 5,000 kilometers. The E-Jet has slightly shorter range, capping out around 4,500 kilometers on certain models.

Tupolev Tu-204

The Tu-204 was commissioned in the late 1980s to match the Boeing 757 regional airliner. Last week Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin proposed expanding production of the Tu-204 to be used by Russian airlines and ease their vulnerability to Western sanctions targeting leasing agreements for Airbus planes. It would likely fulfill the role of an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737.

Unit cost: $35 million. A Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 costs around $75-95 million depending on the model.

Seating Capacity: 160-200 passengers, depending on the layout. An Airbus A320 seats 150-220 people, depending on model, while the Boeing 737 seats 160-215.

Number Produced: 76 Tu-204s have been built since the 1980s. Boeing has built almost 5,000 737s since 1996, and Airbus has built more than 6,000 A320s and related models since 1986.

Range: 4,500 kilometers. This is a little lower than the A320, which has a range of about 5,000 kilometers, and the Boeing 737, which can have a range of 5,000 kilometers to 10,000 kilometers, depending on the model.

Antonov-148

Igor Dvurekov / Wikicommons Antonov-148

A Ukrainian airplane, the Antonov-148 first flew in 2004 and went into commercial service in 2009. It is primarily operated by Rossiya Airlines and Ukraine International Airlines. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia might mean the An-148 is off the table, but strong ties between Antonov and its Russian counterparts may keep the company in Moscow’s orbit. The plane is another rival to the Superjet, with a similar seating capacity, cost and range. It’s advantage over the Superjet is a mature design.

Unit Cost: $24-30 million.

Seating Capacity: 70-90, depending on the layout.

Number Produced: 33

Range: 2,000-5000 kilometers, depending on the model.

Ilyushin Il-114

KALX999 / Wikicommons Ilyushin Il-114

According to President Vladimir Putin, rebooting production of the Il-114 — a small, propeller-driven regional airplane — is a preferred option for shoring up domestic vulnerabilities. The only problem is that the plane has been out of production for two years. Only 20 were ever built, and they are all owned by Uzbek airlines. The plane, although designed by the Ilyushin design bureau, was built in Tashkent. Putin proposed two weeks ago to commission feasibility studies on the possibility of mass-producing the Il-114 at the Aviakor aviation plant in Samara.

The main competitors to the Il-114 are the Bombardier Dash 8 — which costs anywhere from $13 million to $35 million, depending on the model — and related small propeller driven aircraft.

Unit Cost: Out of production, not clear.

Seating Capacity: 64 passengers, while the Bombardier Dash 8 can hold anywhere from 35 to 86 passengers, depending on the model and layout.

Range: 2000 kilometers, comparable to the Bombardier Dash 8.

Irkut MC-21

United Aircraft Corporation Irkut MC-21

Still on the drawing board, the MC-21 project is supposed to supply Russia’s next-generation series of mid-range commercial airlines. There are three variants of the MC-21 under development, each one with a different body length and passenger capacity. The designation MC-21 means “airliner of the 21st century”

The MC-21 is a twin-engine, medium-range airliner intended to replace the aging Tupolev Tu-154 and Tu-204. It will be a competitor to the massively successful Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft.

The Russian government on Wednesday backed a $400 million investment from state-lender Sberbank to Irkut for the project’s development.

The first prototype of the MC-21 was initially supposed to fly this year, but the date has been pushed back to 2015. Production models should hit the market by 2017, assuming there are no further delays in the project.

The MC-21 would be a competitor to the Airbus A320.

Unit Cost: Estimated around $70 million. In February news agency RIA Novosti reported that $4.6 billion will be spent on its development, which should be completed by 2017. The sum will be split between government and private investment.

Seating Capacity: 130-230 passengers, depending on the model

Range: 5,000 kilometers

Tupolev Tu-144

Kristoferb / Wikicommons Tupolev Tu-144

If the situation returns to full-fledged Cold War, aviation geeks may hope to see a revival of the Soviet answer to the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner, the Tu-144.

Aside from passenger routes, the Tu-144 served other uses. For example, the Soviet space program used the sleek jets to train pilots for their aborted Buran space shuttle program. Later, in the 1990s, NASA purchased one for high-speed aerodynamic research.

But the plane has been out of commercial use for some time, and it is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to start production.

Seating Capacity: 140 passengers

Number Produced: 16

Range: 6,000 kilometers

Top Speed: As one of the only two supersonic passenger planes ever built, the Tu-144 was fast, capable of reaching Mach 2.15, about 2,633 kilometers per hour. The top speed of a Boeing 737 is a mere 876 kph.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995495676994324}",neutral,0.9995495676994324,0

Type Certification is the point where aviation safety authorities judge the airworthiness of an aircraft in its manufacturing design and in commercial aviation where aircraft can be delivered to customers and fly commercial passengers.



Airbus A350 MSN 5 Landing at Toulouse – Image, Airbus

During it’s tour, the A350-900 has visited 14 cities over three weeks, performing a mixture of long and short flights in all weather conditions flying 81,700 nautical miles (or 151,300 km) in some 180 flight hours.

Some interesting legs shown include the ultra long-haul legs of Johannesburg to Sydney, and Auckland to Santiago – showing the plane is capable of ultra long haul flying. Doha to Perth is in an interesting route – and will be of interest to launch carrier Qatar Airways.

So what next? Now the final parts of type certification needs to be completed so that deliveries can begin to Qatar Airways (as well as other airlines) who have ordered the A350 aircraft. Route proving is one of the last major hurdles for new aircraft to clear, proving they can do what they say they can in the real world.

For those on the hunt to fly new planes, the journey of the A350 from a development aircraft into an aircraft you can fly aboard is getting more closer each day…

Finnair has become one of the first carriers to unveil what the interiors of its new Airbus A350XWB widebody jets will look like.

Finnair, which describes the A350 as its ""new flagship long-haul aircraft,"" also detailed its first A350 destinations: Shanghai, Bangkok and Beijing. The airline is projected to take delivery of its first A350 next year.

Finnair will configure its A350s with 297 seats, including 46 in business class that will be arranged in a 1-2-1 layout with direct aisle access for each. Each seat converts to a full-flat bed and has a 16-inch touch-screen in-flight entertainment system in addition to AC and USB power outlets.

Seats in Finnair's main economy cabin will be arranged in a 3-3-3- layout. The Zodiac Z300 slim-line seats will have 31-inch seat pitch. At the front of its economy section, Finnair will offer 43 Economy Comfort seats that it says come with ""comfier headrests, high-quality headphones and four extra inches of leg room."" All of the coach seats on Finnair's A350s will have an 11-inch touch screen inflight entertainment system and USB power outlets.

All Finnair A350s will be equipped to offer Wi-Fi.

""Since Finnair's founding in 1923, we have had a long history of operations using the most advanced aircraft available,"" Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo says in a statement. ""As the first European operator of the A350, we are proud to carry forward this tradition on behalf of our passengers, whose safety and comfort remain our first priority.""

Finnair expects to puts its A350 into commercial service during ""the second half of next year, initially serving Shanghai, Bangkok and Beijing."" The airline says A350 service to Hong Kong and Singapore will be added in 2016.

All told, Finnair has 11 A350s on order with options for 8 more. The carrier says the aircraft ""will form the backbone of the company's long-haul fleet and drive expansion plans.""

The A350, of course, is the newest commercial passenger aircraft to be made by European jetmaker Airbus. The jet, more than half of which will be made from carbon fibers, is set to be delivered to launch customer Qatar Airways by the end of 2014.

The A350 – along with Airbus' recently announced update to its A330 widebody – is expected to help Airbus ratchet up competition against Boeing in the long-haul market, where Boeing's 777 and 787 ""Dreamliner"" models have enjoyed strong sales.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999868869781494}",neutral,0.9999868869781494,0

Spirit Airlines is accelerating the start date for five new routes, a move the carrier says is facilitated by the earlier-than-expected delivery of several Airbus 320 aircraft.

""Spirit operates one of the newest aircraft fleets in the Americas,"" Mark Kopczak, Spirit's VP of Network Planning, says in a statement. ""We're excited to add more brand-new Airbus A320 airplanes to our … fleet, and to start service to many locations earlier than planned.""

The routes getting an earlier-than-planned start:

- Atlanta-Chicago: Daily service now starts Oct. 24, up from Nov. 2

- Atlanta-Detroit: Daily service now starts Oct. 24, up from Nov. 2

- Chicago O'Hare-New Orleans: Daily service now starts Oct. 30, up from Nov. 6

- Detroit-New Orleans: Daily service now starts Oct. 30, up from Nov. 6

- Boston-West Palm Beach: Daily seasonal service now starts Nov. 14, up from Nov. 21

Anna.aero , a website that tracks airline route and network news, takes note of Spirit's rapid growth. The airline's fleet is projected to grow by 50% over a two-year period that ends in late 2015, providing ample opportunity for Spirit to add both new destinations and new routes between cities it already services.

With that, Anna.aero writes ""it seems likely that route development folk from airports across the U.S. will be making regular visits to Spirit's (headquarters) in Miramar, Fla., in the hope of benefitting from Spirit's rapid growth.""

Other new routes already on the docket for Spirit this year are:

- Fort Lauderdale-Houston Bush Intercontinental: Daily service begins Sept. 3

The event drew representatives from major international airports, homeland security agencies, and law enforcement. Click here for high-resolution version

ASHBURN, VA--(Marketwired - Aug 14, 2014) - Airbus Defense and Space, Inc. recently hosted a successful demonstration of its SONEX-P threat detection system to representatives of major international airports, homeland security agencies, and federal, state, and local law enforcement organizations. Attendees included representatives of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Pennsylvania State Police, Virginia State Police, and the Domestic Nuclear Defeat Organization.

During the demonstration, which was held at the Airbus Group storage facility, SONEX-P accurately detected and identified a range of hidden explosive threats -- each in a single scan.

What sets SONEX-P apart is its combination of neutron technology with 3D imaging, enabling faster threat detection and more accurate views of a threat compared to X-ray based detection devices. The system's 3D imaging capability and laptop interface allows first responders to interrogate suspicious packages from a safe distance without handling them. The system software is fully customizable and can be optimized to detect other emerging chemical, nuclear and radiological threats.

Easy to use, SONEX-P also eliminates the need for lengthy training to interpret readings. The device does all the work -- signaling a live threat with a red light on its console and a non-threat condition with a green light.

""SONEX-P is automatic detection of threats,"" said Michael Cosentino, president of Airbus Defense and Space, Inc.

""The SONEX-P system represents the future of threat detection; faster results, clearer views of the threat and a greatly improved degree of safety for first responders and explosives technicians,"" he added.

Weighing about 50 pounds, SONEX-P is lightweight, and comprised of only two elements -- a man-portable detection head and a companion laptop computer -- that work in tandem to identify, detect and discriminate chemical, radiological, nuclear or explosive threats located in parcels, luggage, ordnance or abandoned bags.

The first Canadian installations will be performed on two EC135’s owned and operated by Phoenix Heli-Flight in Fort McMurray.

The flight data system is comprised of a Voice and Video Recorder (CV2R), Multi-Function Data Acquisition Unit (MFDAU) and Quick Access Recorder (QAR). The North system is the first affordable Lightweight Aircraft Recorder System (LARS) that is fully integrated into the Airbus EC135. The system provides a crash-protected CVR/FDR that far exceeds the recent ED155 data capture guidelines and enables the operator to record well over 250 engine and airframe parameters, as well as six individual audio channels with the video recording. The initial STC was completed on a PHI Air Medical EC135 and is now installed on over 100 EC135’s throughout North America. The system includes the ability to record all autopilot data streams, as well as analog or digital radar altimeter data. The recorded airframe and engine data is supplemented by an internal Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) data stream. The addition of hook load or other accessory equipment data can easily be accommodated by the North system.

Paul Spring, president of Phoenix Heli-Flight commented, “Since Phoenix first installed HFDM & CVVR equipment in our fleet in 2008, I have been looking for the next meaningful advancement in light and affordable recorders that would provide airframe and engine parametric data to complete the knowledge we gain from basic geospatial data. I know the maintenance and safety benefits first-hand and I won’t operate a helicopter without data recorders. I am extremely grateful that North Flight Data Systems has acquired a Canadian STC to allow us to install this vital equipment in our new EC135 T2e that will be used in the demanding HEMS and SAR roles”.

“This Transport Canada STC represents the first of many FAA STC’s we will have validated in Canada,” said North Flight Data Systems president Jeff Warner. “I have had a long relationship with Paul Spring. He is setting the standard with fully integrated recorders, and it is just another example of the forward thinking he brings to the Canadian market. We have designed our system so that it is adaptable to all the different light single and twin engine aircraft on the market. We are continuing to reach our goal of being able to provide helicopter operators with affordable voice, video and flight data recording equipment that provides the detailed data that has, to this point, only been available on the larger aircraft. We couple our hardware with software that is very user friendly and designed to enable our customers to get useful FOQA and MOQA data.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8081691265106201}",neutral,0.8081691265106201,0

Aerospace and defence group Airbus - then called EADS - and German industrial group ThyssenKrupp jointly bought Atlas Elektronik from BAE Systems in 2005, beating out France's Thales.



Die Welt said Airbus was to make a decision on a sale of its stake in the coming months. ThyssenKrupp likely has a right of first refusal, it said.



Airbus declined to comment and ThyssenKrupp said it would not comment on speculation. Atlas said it was up to its owners to comment on the report.



The news comes only days after Germany's economy minister told the country's arms industry that its future lay in consolidation with European peers, as Berlin becomes more cautious on arms exports.



Atlas Elektronik - which makes a range of products for submarines ranging from combat systems to torpedoes, marine minesweepers and communication systems - generated about a third of its 2013 sales of 441 million euros ($584 million) outside Europe, according to Die Welt.



The paper speculated that Thales could launch a fresh approach if Airbus decided to sell its stake, having lost out in 2005 due to political resistance to a foreign firm becoming part-owner in a German defence business.



While governments and industry agree on the rationale for consolidation in the European defence industry, in practice governments often find deals unpalatable for security or domestic political considerations.



Thales declined to comment on the matter.

Profits are up at the parent company of British Airways, thanks in large part to improving finances at Spanish subsidiary Iberia.

International Airlines Group (IAG), whose holdings include British Airways, Iberia and Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling, says the company's profit surged 55% in the second quarter.

Reuters writes IAG's earnings improvement was ""driven by a recovery at Spanish airline Iberia and (the company) signaled its confidence in the carrier with plans to renew its long-haul fleet."" The carrier is slated to take eight of Airbus' new-age A350-900 jets next year as well as eight new Airbus A330-200 jets. For the A350s, IAG is converting options for the eight planes from a previous order with Airbus.

The aircraft would be valued at about $4 billion at list prices, though airlines receive substantial discounts in making such orders with jetmakers Airbus and Boeing.

Iberia's A330 order will be for the current-generation model of the jet. Airbus has announced a new modernized version of the A330, but that will not be ready until 2017 and beyond – later than Iberia wants, according to Bloomberg News.

Iberia's improving finances were a key factor for parent IAG in moving ahead with the new widebody jets, which The Wall Street Journal says will be used ""to replace 16 less fuel-efficient A340 jets"" currently flying for the Spanish carrier. Iberia has negotiated new contracts with some union groups and has eliminated about 3,000 jobs with plans to cut another 1,400.

""Iberia has taken significant steps to restructure its business and the progress made so far means that we can bring new long haul aircraft into the airline's fleet,"" IAG CEO Willie Walsh is quoted as saying by the Journal.

Individually, IAG's British Airways had a second-quarter profit of €332 million ($446 million) while Iberia reported a profit of €16 million ($21.5 million, according to the Journal. The profit was Iberia's first profitable second-quarter since 2007, says the Financial Times. Iberia lost €35 million during the same quarter a year ago. IAG's Vueling unit reported a second-quarter profit of €30 million ($40 million), according to Reuters.

""All of our airlines had their highest second quarter operating result since 2007,"" Walsh says to the Journal.

Recent events prompt safety notice for AS350 helicopters - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcmVjZW50ZXZlbnRzcHJvbXB0c2FmZXR5bm90aWNlZm9yYXMzNTBoZWxpY29wdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two recent events in which pilots of AS350 series helicopters may have taken off with their yaw servo hydraulic switches in the “off” position have prompted manufacturer Airbus Helicopters to issue a safety information notice for AS350 B3, AS550 C3, and AS355/AS555 aircraft equipped with dual hydraulic systems.

Issued on Aug. 21, the safety information notice (No. 2776-S-29) does not identify the events in question, which it states are still being scrutinized by “the applicable governmental investigative authority.” According to the notice, however, available evidence indicates that the pilots in these events likely omitted the step of returning their collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic switches from “off” to “on” during their pre-takeoff hydraulic checks.

Such an omission results in a complete lack of hydraulic boost to the tail rotor system, yet does not trigger an illumination on the caution/warning panel (CWP) on AS350 aircraft equipped with dual hydraulics. Because of the dramatically increased load required to move the yaw pedals, it is possible for the lack of hydraulic boost to be incorrectly perceived as a tail rotor control failure.

The purpose of the safety information notice is to remind pilots of AS350 B3, AS550 C3, and AS355/AS555 models equipped with dual hydraulics of the procedures and indications for the run-up hydraulic checks in these aircraft, and of the importance of strict compliance with the pre-takeoff checklist.

The difficulty in controlling yaw without hydraulic assistance on AS350 helicopters is related to the high zero pitch return moment of the increasingly large aft tail rotor blade surface area on B1 and higher models. On these aircraft, a yaw load compensator installed in parallel with the tail rotor servo actuator provides the assist required for an average pilot to control the aircraft in the event of a hydraulic system failure.

Airbus Helicopters attempted to move away from the complexity of the yaw load compensating system with the AS350 B3e, which originally incorporated additional tail rotor balancing weights in lieu of the system. However, unexpected stress on the B3e tail rotor’s laminated half-bearings resulted in a series of airworthiness directives, which ultimately required removal of the extra weights and installation of a yaw load compensator on these models

The yaw load compensator is central to the pre-takeoff yaw servo hydraulic check on AS350 helicopters, the correct procedure for which is reiterated in the safety notice. To conduct the check on dual-hydraulic AS350 models, the pilot first switches the collective-mounted yaw servo hydraulic switch to the “off” position, which isolates the tail rotor servo control. At this stage, the yaw load compensator remains boosted by trapped hydraulic pressure, and the pilot verifies that yaw pedal loads remain relatively low.

The pilot then pushes the ACCU TST button “on,” which releases trapped hydraulic pressure through a solenoid valve, eliminating the control assistance provided by the load compensator. The pilot verifies correct operation of the solenoid valve by checking that high loads are felt on the yaw pedals.

When the pilot returns the ACCU TST button to the “off” position, the solenoid valve closes and the ACCU TST push button light extinguishes. However, the yaw load compensator is not recharged until the pilot returns the yaw servo hydraulic switch to the “on” position, at which point the pilot should confirm restoration of hydraulic pressure by checking that no loads are felt on the yaw pedals.

If a rushed or distracted pilot omits these final actions, the CWP will not illuminate unless the aircraft has been equipped with modification 07.4622, which incorporates dedicated amber caution lights for each hydraulic circuit (HYDR1 and HYDR2) and integrates a flashing mode on HYDR2 when the yaw servo hydraulic switch is turned “off.” According to the latest safety information notice, this modification has been incorporated on the new aircraft production line, and will be introduced via a service bulletin to retrofit aircraft already in operation. An Airbus Helicopters spokesperson told Vertical that this service bulletin will not be mandatory, and that “it will probably be up to the operators” to bear the expense of this safety-enhancing retrofit.

The notice indicates that Airbus Helicopters is also working on a future modification to help mitigate the possibility of leaving the ACCU TST button in the “on” position, by replacing the existing push button, with two stable positions, by a stable/momentary position push button similar in the design to the CRANK button. The company spokesperson told Vertical that the timeframe for availability of this modification has not yet been determined.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964101910591125}",neutral,0.9964101910591125,0

Singapore Airlines will deploy the A380 from 27th October 2014, swapping out the existing Boeing 777-300ER between Singapore and Auckland, booked on the following timetable:

SQ285 DEPART SIN 20:50 ARRIVE SIN 11:45+1 SQ286 DEPART AKL 13:30 ARRIVE SIN 19:00 Operates to 26th October 2014 with a Boeing 777-300ER Operates from 27th October 2014 with an Airbus A380 to end of winter season

Combined with other services which use the lower capacity Boeing 777-200ER, this is a seat boost capacity that shouldn’t be overlooked.

The fares and flight changes have been loaded on the Singapore Airlines website, and should be available through other booking engines that are vastly easier to use.

Over the Northern summer period the plane will switch back to a Boeing 777-300ER to reflect the reduced capacity during the southern hemisphere winter.

So how much capacity does this add? Lets compare:

FIRST/SUITES BUSINESS ECONOMY TOTAL 777-300ER 8 42 228 278 A380 12 60 399 471

So, per extra 193 seats a flight a day in each direction during peak months is quite a capacity increase – or for those who prefer to work in weeks, 1,351 extra seats with boosts in First, Business and Economy Class.

Other services will be run with Air New Zealand’s Boeing 777-200ERs and Singapore Airlines 777-200ERs.

For those who want to fly the A380 SuperJumbo to Auckland in some comfort, this can be a rather good option for you to select.

The plane was escorted into Manchester by two Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons after the pilot reported a possible explosive device aboard the plane reported by a passenger.

Manchester Airport was closed for 25 minutes during the incident, with nine flights diverted during the incident. Services resumed around 14:00 local time.

Q23 was operated with an Airbus A330-300 on its schedule service.

After landing, a passenger – 47-year-old man from the North West of England was escorted from the plane by armed police, and was being held in custody for questioning.

Passengers were allowed to disembark the plane as normal, with a full baggage search and crew cooperating with enquiries.

Qatar Airways state:

Qatar Airways can confirm that flight QR23 from Doha to Manchester, an Airbus A330-300, landed safely at Manchester Airport ahead of its scheduled arrival time of 13:15. There were 269 passengers and 13 Qatar Airways crew on board. The crew had received a threat about a possible device on board and #QatarAirways immediately took all the necessary precautions to alert British authorities. The crew is now fully assisting police at the airport with their inquiries. The safety and well-being of our passengers and crew is our top priority. As this is a matter of a police investigation, we cannot comment further at this time.

On Thursday, the airline released photos of “freshly painted” Airbus A350 XWB on the factory lines in Toulouse, France.

Qatar Airways has ordered 80 of the widebody A350 XWB, which will be deployed on a variety of routes on its network of around 140 destinations, it said in a statement.

The A350 MSN005 development aircraft recently concluded a world tour, touching down in 14 cities, demonstrating its “readiness for airline operations on a global scale.”

Qatar Airways Group CEO, Akbar Al Baker, said that the airline is currently in the midst of a massive fleet expansion programme and the incoming delivery of the Airbus A350 XWB type into the fleet will be a significant milestone for the airline.

“We take pride in introducing the latest products and services available to the industry and this new aircraft is a prime example of that,” he said.

Airbus received a big blow earlier this year, when Dubai carrier Emirates cancelled all 70 of its planned A350 XWB orders following a “fleet requirement review.”

Emirates originally placed the order for 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 in 2007, with first delivery slots scheduled from 2019. The deal was reportedly worth around $16 billion as per list prices in 2007.

However, the European planemaker said that it was confident about the A350 XMB programme. The aircraft had 742 firm orders as of June this year, and Airbus hopes that more will follow.

“Interest in the A350 has always been very high with customers and we expect the A350 order book to continue growing in 2014,” it said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999677300453186}",neutral,0.999677300453186,0

The Airbus A350XWB is the French-based plane maker's latest entry in the ""war of the widebodies"" and is taking on rival Boeing's Dreamliner and 777s and landed following a flight from Sydney.

Some Air New Zealand staff will look over the plane today before it flies on to Santiago, Chile at 3pm.

Both planes boast many of the same features -- extensive use of lightweight carbon fibre materials and titanium, more comfortable cabin pressure and many variations of mood lighting throughout the cabin. The A350 that landed about 7.30pm had a sample cabin provided by Airbus, which has 742 orders for the plane.

However, the development of the Airbus started several years after the Boeing and the French company has refined several of the systems Airbus A350 marketing director Mike Bausor said the Airbus was more expensive than its nearest Boeing rival because it was a bigger plane.

The new layout gives direct aisle access to 90% of business class guests, along with AC and USB power outlets and free on-board wi-fi.

Also in the revamp is an improved on-board meal service with matching wines for a “truly top restaurant experience” and a side of “modern Ireland service culture”, with on-demand dining available throughout the flight, rather than only at designated meal times.

Mainly appearing on the longer flights from Dublin to New York (JFK), Boston, San Francisco and Chicago, the new A330 seats come based on the Vantage Suite platform created by Thompson Aero Seating, and are similar to what you’ll now find on JetBlue in the United States.

For getting some rest, the seats transform into a fully-flat, two-metre bed, furthered by a turndown service for some decent shuteye…

If you’re flying out of New York (JFK) or Boston, you’ll also have the option to dine before you fly, giving you the chance to maximise your sleep in the air.

The seats have easy-to-use controls and come with a massage feature, which is both standard and expected in international business class.

On the entertainment front, a larger 16” touchscreen serves to entertain with new-release movies, 90 hours of television content and over 1,000 music albums at your beck and call.

There’s also space for your small tablet or document wallet…

… and for your shoes and laptop.

Perhaps the best feature? When you fly with Aer Lingus from Dublin or Shannon to the United States, you’ll pre-clear U.S. passport and customs formalities in Ireland.

Then, when you arrive in the land of the free, you can wander straight to the baggage carousel or out of the terminal – just like a domestic passenger.

"New Finnair Airbus jets ""could skirt Russia to reach Asian destinations"" - YLE News","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiGmh0dHBzOi8veWxlLmZpL2EvMy03NDA5NzQ20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If Russia closes its airspace to European airlines, Finnair's future fleet could have the potential to fly around the restrictions. However, such an airspace closure would still be a blow to Finnair, which has built its strategy on rapid Europe-Asia connections.

The article is more than 9 years old

At Helsinki Airport on Tuesday, Finnair showed reporters a new Airbus 350 XWB aircraft of the type it will begin flying next year. The national air carrier has ordered 11 of the planes, with the first to be delivered in late 2015.

Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo said that he believed it would be technically possible for the planes to reach Asian destinations by skirting Russian airspace.

Vauramo declined to comment on whether Finnair is one of the European airlines that Russia has threatened to block from flying over Siberia in response to EU economic sanctions on the heels of the Ukraine crisis.

The Finnair chief believes that the new planes will boost the airline's competitiveness.

”This is the biggest investment that Finnair has ever made. They were ordered in 2005 and we received them at a very attractive price,” says Vauramo.

Finnair is to be the first European airline to fly the fuel-efficient planes.

”This new plane uses 30 percent less aviation fuel than previous-generation aircraft and that’s very important in this industry, where a third of costs come from fuel. In addition, there are more seats and modern comforts for passengers,” says Finnair’s Director of Communications Arja Suominen.

The total cost of the plane acquisition has not been disclosed, but Suominen confirms that it is in the billions of euros.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998992681503296}",neutral,0.9998992681503296,0

Airbus and Boeing are going head to head in the lucrative market for long-haul jets.

The latest Airbus has been frozen, subjected to super-hot temperatures, had its brakes jammed on until they reached 1400C and its wings bent to breaking point.

Now the new entry in the fierce battle between Airbus and Boeing - the Airbus A350XWB - is heading for Auckland from Sydney late tomorrow on a route-proving tour before being delivered to its first customer.

Its round-the-world flight gives Airbus the chance to check the performance before certification and to show it off to potential customers who are being spoiled for choice with new Airbus and Boeing's Dreamliner models in production or about to be launched.

The A350 can seat between 270 and 350 passengers and will compete against the Dreamliner and new versions of the Boeing 777. All are twin aisle, widebody planes competing in a cut-throat market in which airlines can play off the plane-makers against each other.

Of airlines serving New Zealand, Cathay Pacific has signed for the A350XWB (which stands for extra wide body), expects to start getting the planes in 2016 and the Hong Kong-Auckland route will be among the first on which it is used.

Air New Zealand - whose 10 Dreamliners are arriving - says the largest version of the A350 will be a candidate for evaluation later this decade as it looks to refresh its Boeing 777 fleet.

Air NZ's new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (pictured) is under competition from Airbus' new A350XWB - that's coming to Auckland on a promotional flight this week.

Singapore Airlines also has A350s on order.

Just like the Dreamliner, the A350 promises a big reduction in fuel burn through lightweight construction using carbon fibre and more efficient engines and added passenger comfort in its three different size models of the plane which is estimated to have cost the European aerospace conglomerate close to $17 billion to develop over eight years.

But, just like the Dreamliner, the new Airbus has been hit with delays, although not as severe as those that plagued Boeing.

Airbus has learned from Boeing's trouble. When the Dreamliner started having problems with its lithium-ion batteries Airbus reverted to more traditional powercell units.

While Airbus says there were 742 orders from 38 customers worldwide for the A350 at the end of June, the programme suffered a setback that month when Emirates scrapped a deal for 70 of the planes valued at around $18 billion. This month Hawaiian Airlines switched from the smallest version A350 to a new generation of the Airbus A330, the A330neo.

The A350 has been put through a battery of tests, including stalls and an aborted take-off at full speed and during the ""maximum energy event"" the brakes of the plane glowed red hot.

It has undergone extreme weather tests at a United States Air Force base in Florida during which it was subjected to temperatures up to a high of 45C and to lows of -40C.

So far the five-strong A350 test fleet has accumulated more than 540 flights and clocked up 2250 hours. The Auckland-bound plane is due to arrive about 7pm. It will be on the ground on Wednesday before flying on to Santiago in Chile.

Airbus is due to deliver the first A350 to Qatar Airways this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9767962694168091}",neutral,0.9767962694168091,0

The Airbus A380 and Boeing 787-9 will play a fundamental role in the development of Etihad Airways’ network.

Etihad Airways, the national airline of the UAE, has reaffirmed its commitment to start Airbus A380 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner operations in December 2014 with additional flights on sale this week for both aircraft and an extensive pilot training programme now underway.

During its first year of operations, the Airbus A380 will be deployed on Etihad Airways’ three daily flights between Abu Dhabi and London, together with selected flights to Sydney, which was on Wednesday confirmed as the second destination to be served by the aircraft.

Between December 2014 and June 2015, the Boeing 787-9 will be introduced on six of the airline’s routes, including Dusseldorf, Doha, Washington DC, Mumbai, Brisbane and Moscow. Etihad Airways will debut its exciting new first, business and economy class products onboard the forthcoming aircraft, and will also introduce The Residence by Etihad, a ground-breaking concept exclusive to its Airbus A380, which features the only three-room cabin in the sky.

James Hogan, president and chief executive officer of Etihad Airways, said: “Our initial Airbus A380 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner flights have been on sale for almost four months and demand has exceeded our expectations, showing that the public share our passion for comfort, service, hospitality and style.”

“The Airbus A380 and Boeing 787-9 will play a fundamental role in the development of Etihad Airways’ network. On existing high-demand routes such as London and Sydney, the A380 will provide additional seats and meet demand for increased capacity, especially in first and business class. The Boeing 787-9 will be used to launch flights to new destinations, add capacity in existing markets and progressively replace existing, less-efficient aircraft.”

Etihad Airways has a total of 10 Airbus A380s on firm order, the first of which will be delivered later this year. The aircraft will initially operate on services between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow, starting with flights EY11 and EY12 from December 27; EY17 and EY18 from March 1, 2015; and EY19 and EY20 from May 1, 2015. As a result, Etihad Airways’ London Heathrow route will be served exclusively by Airbus A380 aircraft from next year.

Tickets can also be purchased on Etihad Airways’ Airbus A380 service between Abu Dhabi and Sydney, with the aircraft operating on selected flights from June 1, 2015.

Each Airbus A380 is designed to carry 496 passengers in four living spaces, including two VIP guests in The Residence by Etihad, nine guests in the innovative first class apartments, 70 guests in the new business class studios and 415 guests in economy class.

Etihad Airways has 71 Boeing 787s on order, including 41 787-9s and 30 787-10s, making it the world’s largest operator of the aircraft type. Deliveries commence this year and the aircraft will operate on the Dusseldorf and Doha routes from December, followed by Washington DC and Mumbai from January 1, 2015, and Brisbane and Moscow from June 1, 2015.

Hogan said: “With additional routes for our Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 now on sale, passengers have a unique opportunity to experience the most-advanced cabins in aviation history. This applies on services between our Abu Dhabi hub and the selected routes, and seamlessly on connecting services where Abu Dhabi is a stopover.”

In preparation for their entry into service, Etihad Airways commenced a training programme for the Airbus A380 in January 2014 and the Boeing 787-9 in February 2014. A total of 149 pilots are undergoing a combination of simulator and classroom training, in addition to flying the aircraft with other airlines that already operate the A380 and 787.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99978107213974}",neutral,0.99978107213974,0
