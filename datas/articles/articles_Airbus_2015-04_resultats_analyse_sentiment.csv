Airbus A380 hits 10-year anniversary amid an uncertain future - USA TODAY,"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDQvMjcvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaGl0cy0xMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWFtaWQtYW4tdW5jZXJ0YWluLWZ1dHVyZS8yNjQzODY2Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380 hits 10-year anniversary amid an uncertain future

The world's biggest commercial passenger jet made its first test flight 10 years ago Monday. European jetmaker Airbus celebrated the milestone for its flagship aircraft, saying the jet was helping to ""shape the future of air transportation.""

Indeed, the company's A380 brought the term ""superjumbo"" into aviation vernacular. The plane is capable of seating more than 850 passengers in an all-coach class configuration, though no airline has yet opted for such a ""high-density"" configuration. Most versions of the jet seat between 407 and 540 passengers, though Emirates recently announced plans for a 615-seat layout. Russian carrier Transaero has detailed plans for a 652-seat A380, the biggest so far.

No matter the layout, the double-decker jet's footprint has grown dramatically since Singapore Airlines become the first airline to fly an A380 with paying passengers in 2007. And, even though no U.S. airline has ordered the jet, A380 routes to the United States continue to multiply.

But Bloomberg News suggests that ""at the tender age of 10, the Airbus A380 is already entering a mid-life crisis.""

The A380 did help Airbus end rival Boeing's decades-long monopoly in the market for jumbo jets. But orders for Airbus' giant superjumbo have remained relatively modest, though so too have sales for Boeing's latest and biggest 747 model -- the 747-8 Intercontinental.

As for the A380, 13 passenger airlines currently have the jet in service. Singapore Airlines was the launch customer. Dubai-based Emirates is by far the biggest operator; its 140 orders account for close to half of all those Airbus has received for the plane.

Airbus initially projected that it would sell more than 1,500 A380s when it formally launched the product in 2000. But, as of April 2015, the company has sold only 317 of the jets. More than half of those have already been delivered, and no new airline orders have come in since 2013.

Bloomberg News writes ""by contrast, the two-engine A350 that Airbus introduced in 2006 had secured 780 orders by the time it first entered service early this year.""

One Airbus official even suggested in December that the company could end production of the jet later this decade. The jetmaker has since walked back that comment, saying emphatically it won't pull the plug on the A380.

""The A380 was always a small market, but it's a growing market,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy says to The Wall Street Journal.

Leahy tells the Journal that A380 orders are about in line with what Airbus expected, though the newspaper says that's ""after taking into account that a planned larger version of the A380, and a freighter offshoot, were never built. Airbus scrapped those derivatives when the program fell years behind schedule and ran over cost.""

Leahy continues to strike a bullish tone on the aircraft's future.

""This will be a very good year for A380 deliveries and orders,"" he tells Reuters, saying talks are underway with ""several airlines.""

Leahy acknowledges to the Journal that ""the market will remain a little bit soft for the next couple of years,"" though he predicts ""very strong growth"" for the A380 from 2020 forward as Asian passenger traffic increases and as major airports there begin to brush up against their flight capacities.

Andrew Gordon, Airbus strategy marketing analysis director, echoes that sentiment to The Sydney Morning Herald. Gordon says airlines across the globe have shown a preference for bigger aircraft types in orders placed during the past few years.

""We see average aircraft size going up; we see airlines trying to put more seats into their existing aircraft; we see the backlog primarily for bigger variants of [aircraft from] the existing programs,"" he tells the Morning Herald. He even pointed to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner as an example, noting orders for the bigger 787-9 variant have already outpaced Boeing's initial and smaller 787-8 variant.

The upside for such higher-capacity aircraft – and especially for the A380 – is especially evident at busy international hubs that are at or close to their maximum flight capacities. High on that list would be London's slot-controlled London Heathrow. In the U.S., New York's JFK airport faces similar constraints. A number of foreign airlines use their A380s for JFK service, but no U.S. airline has yet to express interest in the jet. Delta, the USA's third-biggest airline, has even said publicly that the A380 would likely be a bad fit for the carrier.

For now, Airbus appears steadfast in the belief orders for the A380 will pick up soon enough to keep the model going well in to the future.

""This program will be around for 40 to 50 years,"" Leahy says in a video that Airbus put out specifically for the 10-year anniversary of the A380's first flight.

""No doubt in my mind about that,"" he adds.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9913892149925232}",neutral,0.9913892149925232,0
Smithsonian Launches New IMAX Laser Technology at Airbus IMAX Theater - Smithsonian Institution,"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmVkdS9uZXdzZGVzay9yZWxlYXNlcy9zbWl0aHNvbmlhbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctaW1heC1sYXNlci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFpcmJ1cy1pbWF4LXRoZWF0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Smithsonian Theaters is launching IMAX’s new laser projection system in the Airbus IMAX Theater at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va., May 1—just in time for the release of Marvel’s latest film, Avengers: Age of Ultron. The new system represents a quantum leap forward in cinema technology—providing audiences with the sharpest, brightest, clearest and most vivid digital images ever, combined with a new level of immersive audio.

The Airbus IMAX Theater will be among the first few theaters in the world to feature this cutting-edge technology. The Airbus Theater’s 86-by-63-foot screen is one of the largest screens in the region. The theater’s upgrade will include a brand-new screen and new state-of-the-art 3-D glasses that optimize the laser-system experience in addition to the new sound and projection system. The theater will reopen with a new lineup of films, including Journey to Space, Living in the Age of Airplanes, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and coming soon: Tomorrowland.

The new IMAX laser system is a reimagination of the movie-theater experience. The dual 4K laser projection system is equipped with a new optical engine and suite of proprietary technologies capable of projecting an image with up to a 1.43:1 aspect ratio with maximum resolution and sharpness, unparalleled 2-D and 3-D brightness, industry-leading contrast and an expanded color gamut that will allow filmmakers to present more vivid and exotic colors than ever before.

The next-generation sound system delivers greater power and precision for ultimate audio immersion. The new system has been upgraded to 12 discrete channels plus sub-bass, and includes additional side channels and new overhead channels that will improve the system’s ability to position sounds around the audience.

In addition to built-in image calibration and audio-tuning features, the system is linked to a 24/7/365 Network Operations Center that is constantly monitoring thousands of points of information to ensure optimum performance, show after show. The combination of these new advances together with images and soundtracks remastered specifically for the new laser system will further elevate the audience’s ability to suspend disbelief through the world’s most advanced cinema technology.

“Airbus is proud to be a longtime supporter of the National Air and Space Museum, and we are very pleased with these improvements being made at the Airbus IMAX Theater,” said Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas. “The enhanced experience offered to theater goers by the new laser projection system will serve to underscore why the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is a truly ‘can’t-miss’ destination for visitors in the National Capital area.”

Tickets are available at the Airbus IMAX Theater box office or online at www.si.edu/imax. Groups of 10 or more may reserve tickets now for any date during the film’s expected run by calling 866-868-7774 or visiting www.si.edu/groupsales. The Airbus IMAX Theater is located on the second floor of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va., which is located at 14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway.

Airbus A380 celebrates 10 years: Does it have a future? - CNN,"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtMTAteWVhci1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

So what do you get one of the world’s biggest aircraft for its 10th birthday?

How about a future?

A decade after it first took to the skies with the promise of revolutionizing commercial aviation, the Airbus A380 has so far failed to deliver.

Sales, though initially strong, have tailed off in recent years.

And despite denials from the European manufacturer’s top brass, speculation continues to mount about whether it can continue to produce this giant of the skies.

There have also been moves to make existing A380s more commercially viable, squeezing extra seats into a cabin that once set new standards of spaciousness.

Even before the A380 first lifted off the runway as 50,000 people looked on at France’s Toulouse-Blagnac Airport on April 27, 2005, there were questions about the A380’s viability.

Airbus had sunk $13 billion and 11 years of work – blowing its original deadline and budget – in the hope that orders would flood in.

New breed of superjumbo

The gamble was that airlines would need larger aircraft to fly passengers between expanding major air hubs.

Back in 2005, that seemed like a realistic prospect.

Many major airports were already upgrading their facilities to accommodate the new breed of superjumbo.

Airbus already had 154 firm A380 orders in the bag, while rival Boeing was working on a larger version of its own aeronautical behemoth, the 747.

Plus the double-decker was an instant hit with the flying public, particularly those in premium seats who loved the spacious accommodation and its impressive range of 15,200 kilometers.

Singapore Airlines was the first to take delivery of an A380 in 2007. Other premium brands, including Emirate, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa, soon followed.

The A380’s debut journeys were greeted with excitement around the world, attracting crowds to marvel at its vast dimensions – a 79.8-meter wingspan and 73-meter-long fuselage.

Amid A380 fever, some airlines made outlandish promises of kitting out their new superjumbos with casinos and gyms, although none did.

Alarm bells

John Strickland, director of aviation analytics firm JLS Consulting, says the consumer reaction and economies of scale enjoyed by airlines operating the A380 do tell a success story.

“It’s delivering in its promise in terms of economics, and passengers like it,” he tells CNN.

“Customers are prepared to pay and prepared to pay a premium. Some airlines such as BA report they’re being asked if it’s an A380 when taking bookings.”

That excitement hasn’t translated into solid returns for Airbus, however.

While the initial flurry of orders has since doubled, the pace of sales has notably slackened, with the cumulative total now at 317, of which 156 are in service.

So far this year, Airbus has sold a grand total of zero A380s.

This is against a backdrop of continued expansion in the aviation market – the International Air Transport Association forecast passenger demand to rise 31% between 2013 and 2017.

Meanwhile Airbus – and Boeing for that matter – has seen no shortage of demand for its other, smaller and more economical aircraft, such as the A320, A330 and new A350 XWB.

So, it’s no surprise that stories have circulated about cold feet at Airbus, backed by quotes that appear to cast doubt on the A380’s fate.

In late 2014, Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders sounded alarm bells when he said the manufacturer faced “a decision over the near to midterm on the future of the A380.”

Airbus’s finance chief, Harald Wilhelm, admitted that one option would be to “discontinue the product.”

However, just days later, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier hit back, telling journalists that the manufacturer was fully committed to the A380.

He said such speculation was “just crazy… after all the efforts we have made.”

“I can tell you the A380 will have a brighter future as the market gets bigger.”

Time for a rethink?

Moves are afoot to try to make the A380 a more profitable carrier – a recently unveiled seating reconfiguration that ups the maximum passenger manifest beyond its current maximum of 853 received a tepid response.

There’s also talk of a revamp.

Emirates has been the A380’s biggest champion, building a fleet of 59 with orders in for 81 more.

It’s pledged to significantly increase those numbers if Airbus upgrades its design to create an A380 “neo” capable of supporting a larger payload through newer, more efficient engines, and redesigned wings.

Airbus has yet to commit to any rethink, wanting other airlines to show support.

Such a move would involve more billions spent recreating an aircraft that has to fully offset the expense of its original development.

It would certainly be a nice birthday present for the A380, but would it be money well spent?

Yes, according to Strickland, who says that while Airbus predictions of demand for superjumbos may be wide of the mark, demand will certainly increase.

He says the Emirates is seeing substantial demand for A380 seats as the larger aircraft feeds smaller routes via the incredibly busy Dubai International Airport hub.

That’s a model he sees being replicated across Asia as rising numbers of middle class travelers create more demand for flights and put more pressure on major airports already facing constraints.

“While demand for the aircraft may be light at the moment, it’s going to pick up again in years ahead,” says Strickland.

So, for the A380, there may be many more birthdays to come.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.4847245514392853}",positive,0.4847245514392853,1
Airbus to bolster IFE options for widebody customers - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDQvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWJvbHN0ZXItaWZlLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLXdpZGVib2R5LWN1c3RvbWVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a bid to provide a wider selection of IFE to its widebody customers Airbus is expected to formally add Zodiac Inflight Innovations’ RAVE solution to its A330 catalogue this year. Additionally, following a protracted competition, sources say the Zodiac unit – known as Zii – is in line to be named the third supplier of IFE on the A350 XWB.

Zii’s RAVE seat-centric IFE is already being rolled out on various airlines including Lufthansa and SAS via post-delivery retrofit modification. “We are an approved supplier [on theA330] for Airbus now, as well as conditionally offerable for installations 3Q 2015. Our first customer (SAS) aircraft should deliver in summer of 2015, and we should then be “officially” in the Airbus catalogue,” says Zii VP sales and marketing Harry Gray.

He flatly declined to discuss anything in relation to A350 catalogue inclusion, noting, “Other OEM offerability efforts are underway, however I am unable to disclose further information at this time.”

Indeed, the entire A350 project has been cloaked in mystery. Airbus – which put out a call for tender for “light” A350 IFE proposals years ago – insisted in December that the selection process was still ongoing. And Airbus spokesman Martin Fendt added, “Confidentiality of the process unfortunately does not allow us to communicate yet on the subject.”

But multiple sources tell RGN that Zii has surmounted the initial hurdles, and has entered joint development phase with Airbus. Receiving final approval would be a coup for Zii, as the A350 catalogue offers only two IFE choices – next generation systems from IFE heavyweights Panasonic Avionics and Thales.

Lumexis is also understood to have bid for A350 linefit offerability, though the company declined to comment.

On the other side of the pond, however, Lumexis is now tantalizingly close to receiving full linefit offerability for its fiber-to-the-screen (FTTS) IFE system on the Boeing 737, a type operated by Lumexis’ customers flydubai and Lion Air units.

One thing is clear – airframers are no longer interested in simply featuring two seat-back IFE options in their catalogues. Viva la competition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999899864196777}",neutral,0.9999899864196777,0
"Airbus won't pull plug on A380 superjumbo, CEO says - USA TODAY","Wed, 15 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDQvMTUvYWlyYnVzLXdvbnQtcHVsbC1wbHVnLW9uLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1jZW8tc2F5cy8yNTc2MzI0My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus won't pull plug on A380 superjumbo, CEO says

Airbus says it has no plans to discontinue its Airbus A380 model even as sales for the superjumbo jet remain slow, Reuters quotes CEO Fabrice Bregier as saying in a Sunday story by the French newspaper Les Echoes.

Airbus has received about 317 orders for the A380, which made its first commercial passenger flight in 2007. About half of Airbus' A380 orders have already been delivered. It's also been more than a year since the company has netted a new airline order for the jet.

Emirates, with 140 of those orders, has by far been the biggest A380 customer. Emirates has taken delivery of about 60 of those planes so far. Beyond Emirates. 12 other carriers have ordered the jet. Singapore Airlines, the No. 2 operator of the jet, has ordered 24 total.

Despite the modest overall order count, Bregier tells Les Echoes the A380 program should reach its break-even point later this year.

Airbus also will evaluate design updates that top-customer Emirates wants for the jet. The Dubai-based carrier has pushed publicly for Airbus to update the jet with newer engines that would boost the aircraft's efficiency.

First, though, Airbus is apparently looking to increase the number of seats it offers in standard layouts for the A380. The Wall Street Journal wrote in March that Airbus already had ""upped the advertised average seat count on its flagship plane in a bid to convince airlines the double-decker jetliner is a money maker.""

Airbus now lists 544 passengers as an average A380 seat count, up from 525 previously. Airbus did so by suggesting 11-across seating in coach class instead of 10 seats per row, according to Reuters.

""We have updated our A380 standard cabin layout to reflect the latest cabin innovations and trends, which have evolved since the A380 first entered service,"" an Airbus spokeswoman tells Reuters.

More seats, of course, would help lower unit costs for airlines considering buying the jet. Reuters adds the ""move comes as Airbus steps up efforts to boost sales of the plane, which has not found an airline customer since 2013.""

As for the engine upgrades being called for by Emirates, Reuters quotes Bregier as telling Les Echoes:

""We are already working on ways to make the A380 more attractive economically by adding seats while preserving the amazing comfort of the plane. Long-term, the question will be how to improve its performance by working on aerodynamics and motorization. But we will not do that until a good business plan can be found. That is not the case now and we have no intention to spend indiscriminately.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9473603963851929}",neutral,0.9473603963851929,0
Airbus pitches adding an extra seat to every row in its A380s - USA TODAY,"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDQvMTYvYWlyYnVzLXBpdGNoZXMtYWRkaW5nLWFuLWV4dHJhLXNlYXQtdG8tZXZlcnktcm93LWluLWl0cy1hMzgwcy8yNTg2NzYxMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More middle seats? Airbus proposes 11-across A380 seating

The dreaded middle seat may soon become harder to avoid. That's thanks to a new seat layout unveiled by Airbus this week at the Aircraft Interior Expo in Hamburg, Germany.

The European jetmaker has come up with a seating layout giving airlines the option for even more seats in the economy section of its A380 double-decker superjumbo jet. Airbus is doing so with a layout that squeezes an extra seat into each row in economy.

Previously, Airbus' high-density configuration for its A380 fit 10 seats per row. Now, there will be 11 for airlines that chose the layout. Airbus showed a mock-up of the 11-across seating in Hamburg that featured a 3-by-5-by-3 arrangement.

The layout is one of three new economy class ""choices"" Airbus customers can select for their planes. They're dubbed Premium, Comfort and Budget.

Business Traveller magazine writes ""Premium will be similar to today's premium economy product, which comes with a 19-inch width, and is aimed at business and wealthy leisure travelers."" The Comfort layout will be similar to a typical economy seat.

But it's the Budget layout that will feature the 11-across seating in the A380 and will be targeted toward carriers looking to lure more coach-class passengers while keeping fares low. They could be installed into Airbus' planes as soon as 2017, according to NBC News.

""Ninety percent of world travelers are economy but not all are homogeneous,"" Christopher Emerson, Airbus SVP of Marketing, tells the Leeham Co. aviation consultancy via its News and Comment blog. ""We want to give a choice to the 90% of the economy passengers.

""They are going to be the driver of the growth, the doubling of growth in the next 15 years,"" he adds.

A Budget configuration also apparently will be available on Airbus' other widebodies, which would lead to narrower seating in a 9-across layout on Airbus' A330s and a 10-across layout on its A350s. Emerson tells Leeham Co. that those layouts were designed for markets where price is fliers' top -- and perhaps only -- concern.

""This is the Budget Economy matter,"" Emerson says to Leeham, noting such markets skew heavily toward China and Southeast Asia. ""They are completely agnostic to comfort.""

As for the extra A380 seats, how has Airbus come up with the room?

John Walton, a ""passenger experience"" expert, offers this explanation via the Runway Girl Network:

""Airbus has achieved its record density by cutting seat width by between 1 and 0.5 inches, slashing armrest widths by just over 2cm (nearly an inch), angling window armrests outwards, trimming aisles and — in perhaps the worst case of foot space restriction for window passengers since Bombardier's Q400 turboprop — jamming window seats up against the wall so far that they overhang six inches above the start of the curved sidewall.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999814033508301}",neutral,0.9999814033508301,0

Finnair has begun selling tickets for its first passenger flights on its new Airbus A350 aircraft.

The A350, of course, is the world's newest aircraft to be rolled out by the world's major jetmakers. Qatar Airways became the first airline in the world to take delivery of the aircraft last year, and flew the first-ever A350 flight with paying passengers in January.

Finnair will become the first European airline to put the new jet into service. The carrier will begin flying the A350 on routes between its Helsinki hub and four cities in Asia: Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore.

Finnair says Shanghai will be served with daily A350 service starting Oct. 25. Beijing will follow with daily A350 flights beginning Nov. 21. To Bangkok, Finnair will begin mixing in A350 service with its existing A330 service starting Feb. 1. Similarly, Finnair will begin mixing the A350 into its existing Singapore service starting May 5.

Prior to those long-haul flights, however, Finnair will fly its A350 on ""crew familiarization flights"" throughout Europe during October. The first will come Oct. 5, when Finnair's A350 flies a round-trip between Helsinki and northern city of Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland. Finnair has a full schedule on a special A350-themed web page.

""We are thrilled to reach this important milestone as we gear up for a seamless transition to A350 operations,"" Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo says about the launch of sales for its A350 flights.

""Our A350 investment program is the largest in the company's 92-year history and these aircraft will form the backbone of our long-haul operations for years to come while also playing an essential role in our sustainable, long-term profitability. I can truly speak for all employees when I say we cannot wait to welcome passengers on board,"" Vauramo adds.

For routes where Finnair operates the A350 with a mix of other aircraft, the carrier says:

""Customers can determine the planned aircraft type of their flight by clicking on the flight number during the online booking process at Finnair.com, or by consulting with their travel agent. Changes in aircraft type are possible for operational reasons.""

Finnair will configure its A350s with 297 seats, including 46 in business class that will be arranged in a 1-2-1 layout with direct aisle access for each. Each seat converts to a full-flat bed and has a 16-inch touch-screen in-flight entertainment system in addition to AC and USB power outlets.

Seats in Finnair's main economy cabin will be arranged in a 3-3-3- layout. The Zodiac Z300 slim-line seats will have 31-inch seat pitch. At the front of its economy section, Finnair will offer 43 Economy Comfort seats that it says come with ""comfier headrests, high-quality headphones and four extra inches of leg room."" All of the coach seats on Finnair's A350s will have an 11-inch touch screen inflight entertainment system and USB power outlets.

All Finnair A350s will be equipped to offer Wi-Fi.

The A350 itself is the third all-new aircraft to be rolled out by either Airbus or Boeing during the past decade. It joins Airbus' superjumbo A380 – which debuted in 2007 – and Boeing's new-age 787 ""Dreamliner,"" which made its first flight for an airline in 2011.

In part, the A350 is Airbus' answer to Boeing's Dreamliner. Like the Dreamliner, the new A350 is made partially from lightweight carbon composite fibers that improve fuel efficiency and enhance comfort for passengers by allowing for things like larger windows and more comfortable pressurization and humidity levels.

Also like the Dreamliner, Airbus promises the jet will allow airlines to begin flying routes between cities that previously could not profitably support nonstop service.

Boeing's Dreamliner has delivered on that promise. United, for example, says its Dreamliners allowed it to add nonstop service between San Francisco and Chengdu, China. And British Airways used its Dreamliner to connect London and Austin, giving the Texas capital its first-ever regularly scheduled flight to Europe.

Both the A350 and 787 burn less fuel than other comparable widebody jets that fly long-haul routes. The A350 holds roughly 275 to 370 passengers, depending on the variant and how airlines choose to configure the aircraft.

HAMBURG, Germany – Nepal Airlines took delivery of a new Airbus A320 that will fly to the earthquake-ravaged nation with 5 tons of relief supplies. The Thursday morning delivery completes Nepal Airlines' order for two new Airbus A320 aircraft. The carrier received its first of the aircraft in February.

The delivery date for the second A320 had been planned prior to Saturday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake that shook much of Nepal. But given its timing, European jetmaker Airbus teamed up with German relief organization Humedica to help send the aid.

""It's a plane that's being sent out anyway,"" Humedica coordinator Heidi Nicklin said Thursday morning from a hangar at Airbus' Finkenwerder assembly line facility in Hamburg. ""Because it's flying empty, we have been given the opportunity to fly about 5 tons of relief supplies.""

The shipment – which includes medicine as well as items such as tents and water purification supplies – can help up thousands of victims, Nicklin says.

""We've also been given 10 seats on the plane, as we are able to send a team – mainly doctors and two nurses,"" Nicklin adds.

The flight will travel from Hamburg to Nepal by way of Doha, Qatar, where the A320 will make a needed refueling stop. The flight could leave as early as Thursday, though the exact timing will depend on when a landing slot opens in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu. Operations at that airport -- Nepal's busiest -- have been difficult in the wake of the earthquake.

Nicklin says the team going out in the delivery flight will join another Humedica relief team already on the ground in Nepal.

The scale of the disaster in the Himalayan nation has been immense, with at least 10,000 thought to be injured and thousands killed. The original quake and the powerful aftershocks that have followed have destroyed around 70,000 houses and damaged another 530,000, according to the United Nations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9919137954711914}",neutral,0.9919137954711914,0
"On Airbus 380's 10th anniversary, a lack of sales - UPI News","Mon, 27 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3NfTmV3cy8yMDE1LzA0LzI3L0EtbGFjay1vZi1zYWxlcy1mb3ItQWlyYnVzLUEzODAtb24taXRzLTEwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkvNjE2MTQzMDEzMzcxMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British Airways' Airbus A380 arrives to Washington Dulles International Airport for its inaugural arrival, in Dulles, Virginia on Oct. 2, 2014.

BLAGNAC, France, April 27 (UPI) -- The Airbus A380, jumbo-jet workhorse, enters its 10th year of production this week with no orders from a new airline customer in two years. The aircraft, built by a consortium of French, Spanish, German and British manufacturers, can carry over 500 people, depending on how many bars, showers and other luxuries each plane contains.

The jet was rolled out to acclaim in 2005 as a solution to overcrowded airports and as the future of modern aviation. Today it needs a promotional boost, prompting Airbus to organize a campaign involving members of its sales, engineering, marketing and design staffs.

""It's true the market hasn't developed as much as we've liked. This plane was probably launched 10 years too early,"" said Fabrice Bregier, Airbus chief executive.

A proposal from Tim Clark of Emirates Airlines suggested new engines would improve the planes, adding his airline might expand by 200 newly-outfitted planes.

A more common idea, and one to which Airbus is dedicating its efforts, is to bring the plane back to its original purpose; bulk delivery of passengers. Ten-abreast seating in the economy section will be reconfigured to 11 seats per row, and space-occupying perks like bars and duty-free shopping area, will be eliminated in favor of additional seats.

Planes already in use are also facing adjustments. Emirates, which has 60 A380s in use and orders for 80 more, will remove much of the plane's first-class seating in favor of economy seats, boosting capacity to 615 people on some planes. The Russian carrier Transaero claims it has designed the configuration to accomodate 652 passengers.

Still, the Airbus A380 has only had 317 orders since it was announced in 2000; about 1,200 were projected in its first 20 years. No U.S. airline has ordered the plane, and only five were ordered in China, the world's fastest-growing aviation market.

Airbus no longer takes a loss on each A380 built, although it admits it will never recover its $25 billion investment in the program.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999669790267944}",neutral,0.9999669790267944,0
Flight Review: Taking TAP Portugal’s Business Class to Lisbon on an Airbus A330 - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wNC9mbGlnaHQtcmV2aWV3LXRha2luZy10YXAtcG9ydHVnYWxzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXRvLWxpc2Jvbi1vbi1hbi1haXJidXMtYTMzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recenty, I was booked to fly on TAP airlines from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Lisbon Portela Airport (LIS). On my way there, I flew on their Executive product (aka business class) and on the way home, I flew in economy.

At the airport, I looked for a priority line, but did not see one, so I waited in the standard line. Upon check-in, I was provided with a green sticker on my boarding pass, which indicated I was to receive an expedited security clearance. There was no discussion of whether I had lounge access and the ticket agents did not seem to know — actually, different agents told me to go to different lounges.

I was a bit frustrated, but it was only an hour until my flight anyway, so I decided to relax in a secluded part of the gate with the economy passengers. Checking out TAP’s website, I was able to confirm that I had access to the Lufthansa’s Business Class lounge in Terminal B.

I was hoping to pre-board to get photos of the business class product without other passengers, but it didn’t work out. There were quite a few elderly that needed to pre-board, so by the time I got onto the A330, almost the entire business cabin was full, and taking a shot of the cabin’s seats was not possible.

Once I found my seat (1A), I was offered a choice of water, juice, or sparkling wine before takeoff. Being the fancy gal I am, I went with the sparkling wine — a 2012 Luà­s Pato Espumante Blanc de Blancs.

The cabin setup is 2-2-2, with only four rows. Although it was an intimate cabin, it felt a bit cramped for business class seating, despite being in the bulkhead row.

My first impression was that the business class product felt a bit dated. The seats had ample legroom, but were not overtly cushiony (yup, I am using that as a descriptor) and luxurious. I actually found the seats in economy to look fresher and feel a bit more comfortable (I did have an empty middle seat in economy).

Do not get me wrong — the overall hard and soft product of business excels over economy, but I didn’t feel that much of a difference between the two that I do on other airlines.

There is also WiFi offered and I didn’t intend on really using it, but I wanted to see just how it worked, so I purchased 10MB for about $13 (you know, for science). You also have the option to ’œopen a WiFi tab’ and use it for as much as you want, and get charged at the end. I would not recommend doing this, as you will pay too much money for a super slow, basically useless WiFi connection. My 10MB ran out in about 30 minutes and the most I could do was wait for my Facebook page to load on my phone.

Amenities kits were handed out after takeoff. Enclosed, in a square tin, were some pretty nondescript products; earplugs, an eye mask, a tooth brush and toothpaste kit, socks, a paper-covered pen, lip balm, and some French-made hand cream (why it was not a Portuguese brand, I’m not sure, as the Portuguese are known for their luxurious body lotions and soaps).

The eye mask was actually pretty amazing, and seemed to conform perfectly to my head despite having a single elastic band — not a shred of light was let in. I also liked the adorable airplane foot pads on the socks — it was a nice touch.

Most impressively, their dining service provided a pleasant distraction and helped pass the time. My Portuguese seatmate explained that the wine selection was an excellent example of local choices, and I was able to try the 2010 Casa Ferreirinha Callabriga, produced in the Douro region of Portugal. I thought that was pretty cool and a nice representation of what was offered in the country I was traveling to.

I also loved the tiny TAP-branded glasses, an adorable accompaniment to some of the best airline wine I’ve tried.

Canapes and bread came out first, followed by a choice of starter. I chose the soup, a creamy tomato bisque, then went with the chicken entre which was both tasty, filling, and plated nicely.

There was a funny debate between the flight attendants and my seatmate ’“ apparently halibut is difficult to translate into Portuguese, so they labeled it as ’œalibut.’ Neither the flight attendants nor my seatmate knew what ’œalibut’ was. It became the joke of the flight.

For dessert I chose a plate of fruit, as the former meal had been quite heavy. Bars of dark chocolate labeled with ’œSaudade’ (the best of untranslatable Portuguese words) were handed out at the end. I still have mine and am not sure I will ever eat it – it’s just so pretty.

And of course, I closed out the meal with a glass of Port chosen by my Portuguese seatmate. Maybe more like three glasses or so — I’m not sure, it gets a little hazy. But the Porto Ferreira Quinta do Porto aged 10 years was some of the best Port I had all week.

With a full belly and a head full of wine, it was time to go to sleep. Perhaps the least preferable aspect of the trip was the angled-flat sleep setting for the seats. I had read about this prior to the trip, but never actually experienced it. I actually sleep better at a slightly raised angle, so I figured I’d be alright with the arrangement.

Oh hell no — I was wrong — angled flat is really just a flat surface, on an angle, like you’re sleeping on a playground slide. It felt awkward and became distracting when I couldn’t find myself in a comfortable position; I sort of felt like a mummy or a vampire.

I will give credit where credit is due, however; the pillow was fluffy and comfortable, and the blanket was an actual quilt, warm, soft, and large enough to wrap up in during the hour and a half or so I managed to sleep deeply.

I awoke to a breakfast that was light and nothing overtly special; bread, jam, and a sandwich with some ham on it (I am unable to eat pork and there was no other option, so bread with butter and jam it was). The coffee was good, thick and strong Portuguese espresso style.

The flight was super short ’“ about five hours and twenty minutes total. Between the coursed dining service and delightful conversation with my seatmate, I didn’t even have time to watch a full film. I started exploring the options about an hour before we began our final descent. The on-demand entertainment system aboard TAP’s A330-200 was definitely something to note.

There was an excellent selection of films, television shows, music, games, kids activities, and informational programming. A mix of recently released movies (Birdman, Interstellar) and classics (tons of awesome Charlie Chaplin throwbacks and Audrey Hepburn films), along with some hot TV shows (Game of Thrones, House of Cards) made me wish the flight was slightly longer.

I was able to take advantage of this on the way back, as the same in-flight entertainment system is also provided in economy class. I actually preferred the clean, clear touch-screen seat-back TV to the far away business class screen that was navigated with a nasty joystick (I’m just not into joystick technology, it always feels gross to me).

But unlike economy class, noise-cancellation headsets were provided for business class flyers. These, coupled with the earplugs from the amenities kit, provided the perfect sound barrier when it was time to sleep.

Landing was smooth, and because of the jetstream we actually landed an hour earlier than expected. I’ve never been in an airport at 5am, and it’s a bit creepy ’“ everyone is bleary-eyed and jetlagged.

Typically there is not an arrivals lounge for those arriving into LIS. However, I was fortunate enough to be given access to TAP’s Premium Lounge. Public transportation did not start running from the airport until 7am and instead of paying for a cab, why not hang out in the lounge for a while?

The lounge was quite nice. There are some great snacks (little appetizers really, not just cocktail peanuts) and a full bar to enjoy. I stuck to coffee and some pastries/fruit, which were fresh and tasty.

Because of my fatigued state, I did not take any photos. I wish I did however, because across from where I sat were a group of Portuguese punk rockers knocking back whiskey and beer at 6am. Baller.

There aren’t many choices when looking to fly from the New York area to Lisbon non-stop. The only other flight that really competes is United, which flies either a Boeing 757 or 767 from EWR to LIS (US Airways/American also flies seasonally from Philadelphia). A 767 United premium product could be competitive (possibly better — haven’t flown on it), but I am not sure if I would want to fly on a 757, when I have wide-body options.

There do not seem to be any short-term plans for TAP to upgrade their business class product, but they do have 12 Airbus A350-900s on order. The problem is, that they are not scheduled to enter the fleet until 2017.

Overall, I had a pleasant experience aboard TAP’s Executive product from Newark to Lisbon. But in the end, I’m not sure if what I received in business class versus economy is worth the upgrade. Yes, the food, wine, service and benefits at the airport are a sure win for the premium cost. But the hard product was quite dated and I found some positive aspects of the economy class product (especially if the seat next to you is empty).

Note: TAP provided a complimentary upgrade from economy to business one-way for this review. Opinions are those of the author.

Airbus D&S focuses on commercialisation of Zephyr HAPS - Flightglobal,"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY2l2aWwtdWF2cy9haXJidXMtZGFuZHMtZm9jdXNlcy1vbi1jb21tZXJjaWFsaXNhdGlvbi1vZi16ZXBoeXItaGFwcy8xMTY0MjUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence & Space is preparing for full commercial operations of its Zephyr high altitude pseudo satellite (HAPS), envisioning the establishment of launchpads that could deploy an aircraft anywhere in the world within 24h.

The company is in the process of building a prototype of the next generation of the system – the Zephyr 8 – which will be ready “by the end of the year” and will be the first variant available for customer purchase.

Zephyr, which relies on solar power that is stored during daylight and utilised at night, is a year-long operated lightweight (50kg) surveillance aircraft that is best launched in good weather conditions. As such, five undisclosed launch locations have been earmarked to provide suitable conditions for the aircraft's operations.

Zephyr 8’s predecessor, the Zephyr 7, underwent testing with the UK Ministry of Defence in 2014 at an undisclosed location in the southern hemisphere. It remained aloft for 11 days, reaching an altitude of some 70,000ft, and was the first HAPS to receive a UK Military Aviation Authority registration – PS001.

Notably this happened in winter conditions, so days were shorter and nights were longer, thus putting more stress on the system. Satellite communications were also tested during the flight, which demonstrated a reliable communications link, Airbus says.

Airbus Defence & Space

Furthermore, the company is focusing on developing a system that will be certifiable within national airspace.

In 2014, the older Zephyr 6 variant was tested in Dubai in coordination with the Emirates Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, during which a 30h flight test was conducted in civil airspace with the permission of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.

Procedures and quality assurance is routine to Airbus because of its experience in developing military and commercial satellites, says Paul Brooks, HAPS head of business development and sales at Airbus Defence & Space, so redundancy and safety measures have been incorporated within the design from the start.

The company is looking to aggregate a number of flight hours in order for the Zephyr to be regulated. It also says that Zephyr acts like a glider on descent – “like a shuttlecock” – and therefore poses a low level of risk should it unintentionally descend.

“In principle the flight path is entirely predictable from launch,” says Christopher Kelleher, technical director and flight operations manager for HAPS at Airbus. It typically takes 7h to ascend to 60,000ft.

“It was well worth the effort on both sides getting this through the certification with the MoD,” Brooks adds.

Airbus Defence & Space

Zephyr can carry a 5-10kg payload, which can range from electro-optical/infrared and communications relay to ground radio frequency monitoring. The same payload capacity is found in the Zephyr 7 and 8, but the 8 can fly it for longer due to increased battery performance and solar cells with three times the performance of those found in the 7.

“There is nothing fundamental about the physics of optics that says they have to be heavy,” notes Kelleher.

Four Zephyr 8s will be built initially, and an aircraft with a suite of payloads will be ready for testing should a customer require it. A single 40ft (12m) ISO container will carry three Zephyrs and one ground control system, and it will take two pilots to fly four Zephyr 8 aircraft.

Poland selects Airbus Helicopters H225M for multi-role program - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcG9sYW5kc2VsZWN0c2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzaDIyNW1mb3JtdWx0aXJvbGVwcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Helicopters H225M has been pre-selected for the Polish tender for a new multi-role helicopter fleet. Anthony Pecchi Photo

Airbus Helicopters appears to have won out in the competition to replace Poland’s multi-role military helicopter fleet, with the manufacturer’s H225M (formerly known as the EC725) Caracal pre-selected by the country’s Ministry of National Defence. The procurement calls for 50 multi-role helicopters (reduced from the originally-requested 70), and testing is set to take place in Poland in May and June this year.

In addition to Airbus Helicopters, which partnered with Heli Invest Services, the program had attracted final proposals from AgustaWestland, which submitted the AW149 through its PZL-Swidnik subsidiary, and Sikorsky, which offered the S-70i (an international version of the Black Hawk,) through its PZL Mielec subsidiary.

“We are fully committed to providing Poland with the best product and support for this long-term strategic program,” Airbus Helicopters said in a statement announcing the decision. “We believe our offer will deeply strengthen the defence capabilities of Poland by creating the most value operationally, industrially and technologically.

“We are now preparing ourselves for the next steps of the tender process, cooperating during this test period to answer all requests and questions from the Polish armed forces, and further demonstrate that the Caracal matches all criteria of the tender and their operational needs.”

Investment in the country was believed to be a key component of bid proposals, and Airbus Helicopters recently expanded its Polish presence with the opening of a new engineering design office at Łódź, which will employ approximately 100 engineers. However, the two failed bids would seem to have a more established foothold in the country through their Polish subsidiaries. AgustaWestland even signed memoranda of understanding on offset contracts worth nearly €800 million (US$859 million) with four key Polish industrial sector companies grouped in the Polish Armaments Group as part of its offer.

Sikorsky said its offer would have provided interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces, have seen 70 aircraft delivered while meeting the original stated budget, and have maximized the contributions of Polish industry. “Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation is extremely disappointed that the Polish Ministry of Defense did not select our offer,” the company said in a statement. “Sikorsky remains ready to deliver affordable, low-risk multi-role helicopters that can address Poland’s urgent and compelling security requirements.”

The new helicopters will replace the country’s aging fleet of Mil Mi-8/17 utility and Mi-14 anti-submarine aircraft, and deliveries are expected to begin as early as 2017.

This story was edited on April 24 to reflect the revision of the number of aircraft requested for the program, from 70 to 50.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998233914375305}",neutral,0.9998233914375305,0
Tom Cruise Hangs on to a Flying Airbus (Really) in the Next Mission Impossible - Smithsonian Magazine,"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWl0aHNvbmlhbm1hZy5jb20vYWlyLXNwYWNlLW1hZ2F6aW5lL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtaGl0Y2hlcy1yaWRlLXNpZGUtYWlyYnVzLWE0MDBtLWVtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXJvZ3VlLW5hdGlvbmVtLTE4MDk1NDgwNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is not what we usually mean by “flying standby.”

The recently-unveiled trailer for the summertime action extravaganza Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation builds to a shot of what is presumably the movie’s blue-chip stunt: Star (and producer) Tom Cruise hot-foots his way across the wing of a taxiing Airbus A400M, then grabs hold of the military airlifter and holds on for dear life as it takes off and climbs, the ground beneath him falling away like taillights in a rearview mirror.

As with the prior instances of gravity-defiance in the five-film-deep, 19-year-old franchise—most notably, a stroll up the side of the world’s tallest building in 2011’s Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol—the aircraft-hang is no greenscreen-enabled illusion. It’s a genuine feat of (meticulously planned and rehearsed) derring-do by Cruise, now 52 years old but determined to maintain his much-publicized habit of keeping stunt doubles in the unemployment line.

Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation Trailer Watch on

In an interview with Yahoo! Movies last week, Cruise and Rogue Nation director Christopher McQuarrie discussed the genesis and execution of the set piece, which was shot at RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire, England, last November. Preparation involved the creation of a special frame to mount a camera under the wing of the airlifter and withstand wind resistance, as well as a pair of full-eyeball contact lenses for Cruise so that he could open his eyes while the aircraft was in flight. As the actor told Yahoo! Movies:

The things we were all very concerned about were particles on the runway and bird strikes. We spent days clearing out the nearby grass of any birds, and they brushed the runway as best they could. My stunt coordinator would poke me if he got reports of bird strikes. The pilot had to be on the lookout for anything in the air that could impact me in any way. I also was testing how to keep my eyes open so you have a shot—I can’t have my eyes closed the entire time. The thing that no one else was thinking about, but I was, was the fuel. You have jet fuel coming right out of the back at me because I’m on the wing above the engine. Even when we were taxiing, I was also inhaling the fumes and they were going in my eyes.

Because the script called for Cruise’s character to wear a tailored gray suit, there was no protection from the cold at 5,000 feet. He performed the stunt eight times before he and McQuarrie were satisfied they had enough footage to create a thrilling action sequence.

The movie’s first poster features an image of the airplane-hang in progress. When it was unveiled, I wondered why a military cargo airplane would have a suspiciously-handhold-sized lattice on its side. The piece of equipment Cruise is holding onto, prominently visible in this Daily Mail photo gallery, is a “deployable baffle,” intended to give paratroops an instant to get clear of the massive aircraft when jumping before they’re caught in the Jetstream. Airbus’ website notes the A400M—a four-engine turboprop design that had its first flight in 2009—can be configured to carry up to 116 paratroops. Dispersing that many soldiers quickly would likely necessitate the use of the cargo ramp as well as the spoiler-protected paratroop doors on either side of the fuselage.

While the stunt represents Cruise’s first flight, or eight flights, on the outside of an aircraft, he’s held a pilot’s license since 1994, according to Forbes contributor Matthew Stibbe. The star’s personal fleet includes a World War II-era P-51 Mustang. No pilot license is required for PC users to download Airbus’ A400M—The Game. I’m using a Mac, so I can’t tell you whether or not the game includes a level where you must try to shake off an unusually determined secret agent who’s fixed himself to the side of your airplane.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999517202377319}",neutral,0.9999517202377319,0

From 2020 MERLIN will measure methane (CH4), one of the main greenhouse gases, in the Earth’s atmosphere. MERLIN is the first joint Earth observation satellite programme between the French (CNES) and German (DLR) space agencies.

“We are happy to run the first Franco-German Earth observation satellite programme and we will build the spacecraft on both sides of the Rhine,” said François Auque, Head of Space Systems. “Thanks to this contract, our new satellite platform AstroBus-S has its second order (after Perusat-1), proving its competitiveness in this range of small Earth observation satellites on the global market.”

MERLIN is one of the European satellite programmes designed to study greenhouse gases and the phenomenon of global warming. Using its LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) instrument, MERLIN will “probe” the atmosphere to determine the varying concentrations of methane, which, together with carbon dioxide (CO2), is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect.

Airbus Defence and Space has already been selected by DLR as prime contractor for early development phases (0-B) of the MERLIN payload. The LIDAR instrument shines a laser at two different wavelengths through the atmosphere, and measures their reflections off the Earth’s surface or the cloud tops. As one wavelength is absorbed by the methane and the other is not, this difference can be measured and the methane content in the atmosphere determined. Being an active instrument with its own light source on board, the MERLIN LIDAR instrument does not have to rely on Sun illumination of the observed areas and can therefore operate day and night.

MERLIN is the first institutional programme to be based on the new AstroBus-S platform, developed by Airbus Defence and Space in partnership with CNES, as part of the French Investment for the Future Programme (Plan d’Investissements d’Avenir – Myriade Evolutions). AstroBus-S will form the basis of the Airbus Defence and Space range of 400 kg class Earth observation satellites for imaging, climatology and science missions. AstroBus-S complements the current AstroBus range, which has underpinned commercial export successes for more than 15 years (Chile, United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Peru, etc.) and been the technological spearhead of the most emblematic institutional missions (MetOp-SG, Spot, etc.).

The MERLIN programme will be carried out under the aegis of CNES and DLR. On behalf of CNES, Airbus Defence and Space in France (Toulouse) will be responsible for the satellite, its platform and its integration with the instrument. The LIDAR instrument will be designed and built by Airbus Defence and Space teams in Germany (Friedrichshafen, Ottobrunn) on behalf of DLR.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999963045120239}",neutral,0.9999963045120239,0
A380 sales disappoint - DW (English),"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9lbWlyYXRlcy1jZW8tZmlnaHRzLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtb2YtZ2lhbnQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAvYS0xODQxMDY0OdIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9lbWlyYXRlcy1jZW8tZmlnaHRzLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtb2YtZ2lhbnQtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAvYS0xODQxMDY0OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It has been ten years since the inauguration of the Airbus A380, the world's biggest passenger airliner. Sales have been disappointing, but the giant aircraft still has fans - with Emirates its biggest supporter.

The maiden flight of the Airbus A380 ten years ago today, on 27 April 2005, was meant to usher in a new era of airline efficiency. The huge aircraft with its two passenger decks offering room for up to 853 passengers would replace two or three smaller aircraft on busy routes, so the thinking went, thereby reducing landing-slot congestion and improving fuel efficiency per capita.

Airbus was confident that there was a market for about 1,500 giant passenger aircraft between 2005 and 2025 - and it had only one competitor for the supersized-airliner market niche: Boeing's freshened-up 747-8 Jumbo.

So far, however, Aircraft has had orders for just 318 A380s, and only about 160 of the aircraft have been delivered to clients. Around 20 of the deals currently on the order books are uncertain. Several airlines, including Russia's Transaero, China's Hong Kong Airlines, or the UK-based Virgin Airlines, are openly considering withdrawing their A380 orders.

It's not clear whether Airbus will ever recoup the roughly 20 billion euros in development costs it invested in designing the A380. But for all that, some airlines remain committed supporters of the big jet.

It started so well

Things looked so promising on that April morning ten years ago, when the first A380 left the tarmac at Toulouse-Blagnac airport in southwest France. Fifty thousand people were on hand to witness the giant's maiden flight. They thought they were watching the future take wing.

The massive jet, 421 tonnes heavy, lifted off into the mid-morning sunlight with apparent ease. The watching crowd was impressed by the quietness of the engines. Three hours and 54 minutes later, the colossus landed again, to rousing cheers from enthusiastic Airbus workers.

The first commercial flight of the A380 occurred two and a half years later. On 25 October 2007, a Singapore Airlines A380 landed in Sydney, Australia, to headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald proclaiming that ""the future has landed in Sydney"".

Commercial crosswinds have slowed A380 sales

By now, it's clear that in commercial terms, the A380, in its current form, is proving a bit of a flop. There have been repeated setbacks affecting the A380's order books in strategically important markets.

Among them: India's Kingfisher Airlines went bankrupt, Japan's discount airline Skymark withdrew its orders shortly before delivery of several A380s - Airbus is currently taking it to court - and even solid operators like Lufthansa and Air France have reduced the size of their A380 fleet orders.

Some setbacks and cancellations were due to delays in A380 delivery due to production problems, but these have been overcome. The bigger setbacks have had more to do with economic conditions. The global financial crisis that began in 2007-8 was a heavy blow. Changes in airline passenger travel trends, however, have been the most important factor.

Nowadays, many airlines offer travellers direct nonstop flights in medium-sized aircraft between medium-sized cities. It is often no longer necessary to fly from megacity to megacity, change aircraft, and proceed onward to one's final destination. Airlines have been able to run profitable businesses between smaller cities by buying smaller, more fuel-efficient jets like the Boeing 787 or the Airbus A350.

Passengers like the giant aircraft

That's not to say that passengers don't like flying in A380s or Jumbos. Travellers enjoy the roomy cabins.

A380s have so far shifted 85 million people between destinations, some of them in first-class luxury. Image: picture-alliance/dpa

Emirates, which has bought more A380s than any other airline, has two on-board showers available for first-class passengers on its A380s.

Like Qatar Airways and Etihad, Emirates also features a lounge with a bar. Korean Air even has an on-board duty-free shop.

Etihad, Abu Dhabi's carrier, recently broke new ground in commercial airline travel luxury with ""The Residence"", a sort of private apartment on-board its A380s, featuring a butler, bedroom, and shower.

Even passengers in the economy section of the A380s often find the aircraft a special treat. ""About half of the economy passengers still take photos before they enter or exit the aircraft,"" according to Emirates boss Sir Tim Clark. ""The Boeing 747 had a wow-factor phase in the 1970s, but the A380's wow-factor phase seems to be lasting much longer.""

A380's future: Redesign or cancel?

The Emirates CEO is a big supporter of the A380, with 140 orders on the books and 60 of the big aircraft already in operation in his fleet. The giant aircraft is perfect for Emirates' business model. Clark was accordingly shocked to learn that Airbus's financial chiefs openly discussed, in December 2014, a possible end to A380 production.

Emirates is promoting a different solution: a redesigned, longer A380-900, something which had always been part of the A380's long-term production plan. Clark also wants the A380 to be fitted with new, more efficient jet engines, noting that most of the technology on which the current version of the A380 is based stems from the 1990s. Emirates is offering to buy 100 more A380s if the improvements Clark favors are made.

Emirates Airline CEO Sir Tim Clark is doing what he can to persuade Airbus to keep producing A380s Image: dapd

A stretch version of the A380 would enable Emirates to transport over 650 passengers in luxurious surroundings. Today's A380s transport between 407 (Korean Air) and 519 (Emirates) passengers. Putting more passengers on a stretched A380-900 would improve the aircraft's profitability.

Clark has said that the A380's operating costs could be shrunk by 13 percent given new, more efficient jet engines. Those are significant numbers in the airline business, which generally has tight margins.

But Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier is so far reluctant to agree to Clark's proposals. He doesn't yet see sufficient demand to support the estimated three billion euros in additional development costs that would be necessary to generate an improved A380.

Airbus would require orders for around 250 additional A380s to justify investing in a redesigned version of the aircraft, according to Brégier, who has said that he thinks the A380's production had been a planning failure. ""The aircraft was introduced probably ten years too early,"" he recently said.

Sir Tim Clark, by contrast, has expressed optimism about the giant aircraft, and has hinted that there could be significant news coming from Emirates in autumn 2015. Clark never stops trying to drum up enthusiasm for the big birds: ""I try to persuade everyone, including my competitors, that the A380 is a great aircraft.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8913316130638123}",positive,0.8913316130638123,1

Emirates pushes A380 seating capacity past 600 - USA TODAY,"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDQvMTYvZW1pcmF0ZXMtcHVzaGVzLWEzODAtc2VhdGluZy1jYXBhY2l0eS1wYXN0LTYwMC8yNTc3MTc0Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates pushes A380 seating capacity past 600

Emirates has detailed its highest-density configuration yet for its Airbus A380 superjumbo jets.

The new 615-seat layout tops the carrier's 517-seat versions of the jet and will begin flying this year on a route between Dubai and Copenhagen.

The move would make Emirates the only carrier to fly the A380 with a seating capacity above 600. The densest current A380 configurations have between 507 and 538 seats. Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Thai Airways are among the airlines flying the aircraft with in those layouts with more than 500 seats. At just 407, Korean Air's offers the lowest seating capacity on the A380.

The A380 has a maximum capacity of 853 seats in an all-coach class configuration, though no carrier has yet outfit an A380 in such a way. Air Austral, a French carrier based on the Indian Ocean territory of Réunion, had ordered two 840-seat versions of the A380. That airline has since abandoned the idea of a single-class A380.

But even before Emirates begins flying its high-density A380s, the ""crown"" could end up going to Russian carrier Transaero. The airline is scheduled to begin taking delivery of 652-seat A380s sometime this year.

As for Emirates, it is able to up its seat count on the planes by eliminating the first-class cabin, going from a three-cabin layout to one with just two classes of service: business and economy. The new-layout A380s will feature 58 flatbed seats in business class and 557 in coach.

Emirates' first class cabin, of course, is known for its high-end ""suites."" The cabin also has two showers for the exclusive use of first-class fliers, though there's a five-minute time limit per passenger for running water.

Australian Business Traveller writes ""Emirates will retain its original three-class A380 layout for the most profitable long-haul routes, while using additional two-class A380 to serve selected markets where there's a high demand for seats, but not at high prices.""

As for Emirates' launch of the high-density, two-class A380s on the Copenhagen route, that will come in December.

""Based on strong load factors, we are happy to further upgrade the route,"" President Tim Clark says in a statement.

""We made significant investments to expand Copenhagen Airport and upgrade its facilities in order to make it A380-compatible,"" adds Copenhagen Airports' CEO Thomas Woldbye, noting Copenhagen will become the first airport in Scandinavia to get regularly schedule A380 service. ""We are very excited about Emirates' decision to deploy an A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft, to our airport. Copenhagen will be the first in Scandinavia to offer a scheduled A380 service.""

Emirates' A380s will replace the smaller Boeing 777 it currently operates on the route.

Emirates is by far the world's biggest operator of the A380, accounting for close to half of all the orders that Airbus has received for the world's biggest commercial passenger plane. Emirates has order 140 A380s in total, and has received about 60 so far. Emirates' ""ultra-long range"" A380s seat 489 passengers in a three-class layout.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99988853931427}",neutral,0.99988853931427,0

A new version of the twin-engine EC145 rotorcraft has received its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency. The EC145 (formerly known as EC145e) has been developed by Airbus Helicopters to offer a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for utility users.

Integrating a standardized interior and an equipment list tailored specifically for utility missions, the EC145s payload is increased by 146 kg from the previous EC145 utility variant.

“By offering a multi-role helicopter configured with a basic cabin layout and mission-tailored systems, the EC145 meets the needs of utility and commercial operators, while being highly competitive in price and available with reduced delivery times,” said Manfred Merk, who is head of the H145 program at Airbus Helicopters.

With EASA certification, the EC145 is approved for single-pilot day/night operation in VFR (visual flight rules) conditions. Certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is expected mid- 2015.

The weight of the EC145 has been reduced through removal of such items as the automatic flight control system and the replacement of conventional cockpit instruments by Garmin’s G500H avionics suite with dual electronic flight displays.

The EC145 is well adapted for a full range of utility duties, from passenger transport and aerial fire fighting to airlift missions with both internal and external loads. Following its first flight in August 2013, the no. 1 EC145 confirmed its capabilities – including during firefighting demonstrations in Spain.

The EC145 for utility missions enlarges the Airbus Helicopters’ H145 family, from which more than 700 rotorcraft are in service. It is the perfect complement to the next generation helicopter H145, which Airbus Helicopters debuted on the market in summer 2014. With some 120 customers in 44 countries and 1 million flight hours accumulated, the /H145 offers flexibility and versatility in worldwide operations.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5611451864242554}",positive,0.5611451864242554,1
Airbus wants answers from Germany over U.S. spying claims - CNN,"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxNS8wNC8zMC9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1nZXJtYW55LW5zYS1zcHlpbmcvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNNMoney —

Airbus is demanding answers from the German government following media reports that it helped the U.S. National Security Agency spy on the company.

The aviation group, based in France, said it would file a criminal complaint about suspected industrial espionage in an attempt to force an explanation from Berlin.

“After all this reporting, with no clarification, it’s time to file that application for investigation in order to find out what happened,” said Airbus (EADSF) Group CEO Tom Enders on CNN’s Quest Means Business.

“We have heard nothing from the German government so far, so there are plenty of questions…we are asking for a normal thing – for clarification and investigation.”

Earlier this week, Germany’s Bild newspaper reported that U.S. spy agencies had targeted Airbus and other companies for years, and that the German government had been aware of it since 2008.

Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung said that the NSA had used a German intelligence service listening post to spy on European countries for more than a decade. It said the main targets were senior officials in the French foreign ministry, the office of the French president, and the European Commission. Some companies were also targeted, it said.

The new claims of cooperation with the U.S. in spying activities are putting pressure on the German government, which has for years characterized itself as a victim of snooping. In 2013, the U.S. came under fire for allegedly tapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.

Airbus is the only serious rival to Boeing (BA) in the large jet airliner market. The competition is fierce, and the companies have accused each other of receiving illegal state aid in the past.

The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it does collect information about economic and financial matters, and terrorist financing.

“What we do not do, as we have said many times, is use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of - or give intelligence we collect to - U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line,” it said in a statement.

“Nobody knows right now what the truth is,” Enders said. “If there’s so much smoke, I guess there must be some fire somewhere.”

Boeing clings to lead over Airbus in long-haul jets - Jordan Times,"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vam9yZGFudGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLWNsaW5ncy1sZWFkLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLWxvbmctaGF1bC1qZXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK — Boeing is fighting tough efforts by rival Airbus to score big gains in the market for long-haul jets, a segment of the massive aircraft market that the US giant has dominated.

Neck-and-neck with Boeing in sales of single-aisle, 150-200 passenger jets, Airbus has badly lagged its US archrival in wide-body aircraft with 250-450 seats.

But Airbus has high hopes for its new A350, which it says is ""setting a new standard of efficiency in its class"" with a lightweight, carbon fiber composition that can save up to 25 per cent in fuel consumption.

Airbus believes the A350 can compete with Boeing's classic 777 aircraft as well as the its heavily-touted 787 Dreamliner, which also boasts carbon fiber construction to cut weight.

But Boeing executives say they are confident the US company's lead will stick.

Airbus ""still don't have the market coverage we do, especially on the upper end of the market"", said Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth. ""You see it with the orders. You see it with the market share. They are just not doing that well.""

Tinseth said Airbus would need to develop a new version of its A350 with 450 seats to compete with the Boeing 777-9X.

But some analysts see a more competitive landscape than Boeing is letting on.

""If you exclude the 777-9X, the other models can run the same routes with the same capacity and a similar level of performance,"" said Michel Merluzeau, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.

Airbus has ""got a foot in the market of the 787 and a foot in the market of the 777"", Merluzeau added.

Jumbo jet demand rising

The appeal of long-haul aircraft is the same for both of the world-leading aircraft makers: greater profits.

Whereas Boeing's smaller 737 line sells for $78-$113 million, the 787 is listed at $218-$297 million and the 777 at $269-$388 million.

A new round of jumbo plane orders is expected from carriers seeking to cut their fuel costs. Demand for the bigger planes will reach 7,800 units worth about $1 trillion in the coming 20 years, according to Airbus.

Boeing currently leads with about 55 per cent of the market. It has logged 1,105 orders for the 787 against 780 for the Airbus 350, according to the most recent figures.

But Airbus has had some major wins of late. In November, US carrier Delta Air Lines announced a firm order for 25 new A350 widebodies.

""You can't debate the fact that it is a massive endorsement of your product line,"" said Airbus chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy.

Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier has set a goal of winning more than half the global market.

To win market share, it is offering aggressive commercial terms to carriers, as suggested by Airbus accounts: in 2014, Boeing had a profit margin of 10.7 per cent per order compared with 6 per cent at Airbus.

Boeing remains a step ahead in the race for delivering large planes, producing ten 787s per month since the middle of 2014 with plans to reach 12 per month in 2016.

Airbus plans to produce 15 of the A350 in 2015 with output reaching 10 per month in 2018.

""Boeing should be able to maintain its market share through the end of this decade,"" said an analyst note from Trefis.

Recent successful launches by Boeing in the 777 and 787 lines should allow it to ""maintain its lead over Airbus in the wide-body airplane segment"", Trefis added.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.4896261394023895}",positive,0.4896261394023895,1
Nova Systems enhances its flight test capability through purchase of Airbus Helicopters H135 - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL25vdmFzeXN0ZW1zZW5oYW5jZXNpdHNmbGlnaHR0ZXN0Y2FwYWJpbGl0eXRocm91Z2hwdXJjaGFzZW9mYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nova Systems’ new H135 will be fully instrumented and will be used to test the latest sensors, avionics and mission systems, as well as providing flight trials support for both military and civilian organizations.

Aerospace and professional services provider Nova Systems is expanding its European business (Nova Systems U.K.) with the purchase of an Airbus Helicopters H135 – providing the option of low cost and reliable flight trials for governments and manufacturers alike.

The aircraft will be fully instrumented and will be used to test the latest sensors, avionics and mission systems, as well as providing flight trials support for both military and civilian organizations. This will include the development of novel and technologically advanced sensors and electronics, to ensure they can be safely operated by pilots under the remit of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), utilising Nova’s in-house EASA approved, aerospace design organization.

The timely option of low cost and reliable flight trials – something traditionally reserved for expensive front line platforms – comes against a backdrop of defence budget cuts.

The Nova helicopter trial capability will deliver services through the use of the best value for money twin engine aircraft in its class, coupled with pilots and engineers trained at the internationally renowned Empire Test Pilots’ School (ETPS).

Operated from the Kemble Aerodrome in Gloucestershire, U.K., the Nova Systems helicopter project was developed by Simon Sparkes – an ex Royal Navy helicopter pilot and former Commanding Officer of ETPS.

“This project is an exciting step for the company and something which will serve to enhance Nova Systems reputation as the premier independent flight test company in Europe,” he said.

CEO of Nova Systems U.K., Steve Camporeale added: “Our investment in this helicopter, and the capabilities it brings to Europe, are geared towards providing a fully integrated and high quality service to our customers, both military and civilian.”

Global CEO and chairman of the board Jim Whalley said: “It’s a significant expansion of our U.K. and European service offering and will allow Nova to further cement is position as the leading provider of independent flight test services in the region.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5005698800086975}",neutral,0.5005698800086975,0
"""Choice"" becomes new PaxEx curse word on 11-abreast A380 - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 15 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDQvY2hvaWNlLWJlY29tZXMtbmV3LXBheGV4LWN1cnNlLXdvcmQtb24tMTEtYWJyZWFzdC1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an enormous U-turn on its previous “18 inches for all” economy class campaign, Airbus is finally displaying its much-anticipated eleven-abreast A380 main deck seating at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, setting a new record for most seats abreast on any aircraft cabin, ever.

Airbus had promised to show the 3-5-3 layout at last year’s AIX, but never brought the goods to the aviation industry’s largest interiors trade show in 2014.

Airbus’ relatively newly appointed vice president marketing Ingo Wuggetzer, whose start date in October coincides with the last time RGN heard Airbus pushing its 18” agenda, is insistent that the 3-5-3 “basic economy” on an A380 would be a relatively good “basic economy” product — and indeed it would be less terrible compared with the other Airbus basic economy options, the middle seat of five excepted.

A centre section of five is, of course, nothing new. The Douglas DC-10, McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and Boeing 777-200 aircraft families were available and outfitted in 2-5-2 configurations throughout their history, although passengers and the industry eventually came to prefer the 3-3-3 layout common on the 777 or A350-sized cross-section. 2-5-2 was, after all, significantly more pleasant when load factors were not at all time highs and the middle seats of five were not routinely filled.

Yet the 3-5-3 A380 is obviously a downgrade from the passenger experience point of view. Leaving the centre seat of five aside, Airbus has achieved its record density by cutting seat width by between 1 and 0.5 inches, slashing armrest widths by just over 2cm (nearly an inch), angling window armrests outwards, trimming aisles and — in perhaps the worst case of foot space restriction for window passengers since Bombardier’s Q400 turboprop — jamming window seats up against the wall so far that they overhang six inches above the start of the curved sidewall.

In pure passenger experience terms, this results in a pretty dire experience for the window passenger in particular, as demonstrated below by RGN’s’s Jason Rabinowitz (whose 6’1”/185cm frame is by no means Brobdingnagian). It’s simply impossible for window passengers to put their feet flat on the floor. That’s one thing on a 30-90 minute Q400 hop, but quite another on an aircraft like the A380 that flies the longest nonstop commercial flight in the world.

Last year, Airbus was mooting the idea of raising the cabin floor by approximately two inches to avoid this overhang issue, but Airbus staff confirmed to RGN that the airframer elected not to add this reengineering effort to the eleven-abreast offering, which is supported by seatmakers Geven (the rounder headrest version) and Zodiac (with the more trapezoidal shape).

Airbus’ shift away from its previous push for 18” width for all was marked this week by Airbus’ longstanding head of aircraft interiors marketing Zuzana Hrnkova at Monday’s Passenger Experience Conference, and by VP marketing Ingo Wuggetzer in a media briefing on Tuesday.

The seatmaker is now seeing a three-way segmentation in the economy sector, i.e., everything below business class, which its subsidiary Stelia (formerly Sogerma) is segmenting further, with four separate types of longhaul business seating on display at AIX.

Let’s get the worst of economy out of the way first: the new “basic economy” situation for the 11-abreast A380, 10-abreast A350 and 9-abreast A330 that willl be narrower than 17” on the latter two aircraft — less than the existing much-loathed high density Boeing seating on the 10-abreast 777 and 9-abreast 787. Airbus is also calling these the “max abreast” seating. Wuggetzer told RGN that Airbus has also managed somehow to change the 16.4” width previously quoted for 3-4-3 A350 layouts to 17”, but it’s as yet unclear how the airline has found a full six inches across the cabin for this addition.

In the middle of the economy pack is what Airbus was previously pushing as the standard for the back of the bus, which it now calls “comfort economy” (let’s hope the lawyers at Delta aren’t feeling testy this week). This is the 10-abreast A380, 9-abreast A350 and 8-abreast A330 that are currently the roughly 18″ passenger pleasers. (A330 measurements are often cited as 17.5” depending on seatmaker and exactly is being measured.) A key differentiator is that comfort economy has one fewer seat in each row compared with basic economy’s max abreast.

At the top end is premium economy, much as we now know it — around 19” seat width, with two seats fewer than max abreast. Airbus’ Wuggetzer took great pains to show how many airlines currently have premium economy (26, according to the airframer), and how many A380 operators do (five: Qantas, Air France, BA, Lufthansa and Singapore), in what seemed very much like a deflection from the passenger experience implications of 11-abreast 3-5-3 A380 seating.

Using the “well, passengers who don’t want 3-5-3 can buy premium economy” argument would be fine, except that those airlines fly a minority of the existing A380 fleet — and Airbus’ same presentation highlighted that premium economy fares are twice economy, compared with four times for business class.

The gulf between the best longhaul business class seats (as seen on A380 operators without premium economy like Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Asiana, as well as on announced A350 operators like Qatar and Finnair) and the basic economy seats that Emirates or Etihad offer on their 777s, and Qatar offers on its 787s, is widening. How do we pull it back?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999847412109375}",neutral,0.9999847412109375,0
Airbus squeezing extra economy seat into A380 superjumbo aircraft - Fox News,"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtc3F1ZWV6aW5nLWV4dHJhLWVjb25vbXktc2VhdC1pbnRvLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1haXJjcmFmdNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtc3F1ZWV6aW5nLWV4dHJhLWVjb25vbXktc2VhdC1pbnRvLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1haXJjcmFmdC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flyers are already feeling the squeeze in coach class but it looks like things may get worse.

While Southwest is adding extra seat width on new aircraft to accommodate growing bodies, Airbus is continuing the trend of shrinking seats, announcing plans to offer an 11-across economy seat configuration on new A380 superjumbo carriers, reports Aviation Week.

Currently, the Airbus A380 seats 10 passengers in an economy row with a 3-4-3 configuration. The new layout would add an extra seat to the middle row, squeezing people into a too-close-for-comfort 3-5-3 configuration. Though the new seats will be same width as the current design—18inches across—Airbus has slightly modified the entire cabin to raise the plane’s capacity from 525 passengers to 544.

But according to Harvard data, the average human shoulder width is also 18 inches. Airbus has not released official measurements detailing length on the entire row but given the seat dimensions, it does not take a professional mathematician to figure out that many passengers-- big or small-- may literally be sitting shoulder to shoulder in the new seat configuration.

Attendees at Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany were offered the chance to test out the new seats and none seemed particularly eager about the possibility of welcoming an extra companion into a cramped economy class class row.

Emirates, which initially supported the idea of adding an extra seat to its existing fleet of A380 aircraft for more efficient service, says that it will not proceed with ordering any of the newly designed aircraft. But according to Aviation Week, Airbus is still moving forward with delivery, with two manufactures on board to make the seats available by 2017.

After unveiling the new configuration, Airbus Vice President-Cabin Innovation and Design Ingo Wuggetzer said that he sees major growth potential in the “budget economy” segment to help airlines increase annual revenues.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995224475860596}",neutral,0.9995224475860596,0
Airbus offers three economy class 'choices' – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTUvMDQvMTQvYWlyYnVzLW9mZmVycy10aHJlZS1lY29ub215LWNsYXNzLWNob2ljZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled a choice of three different economy class concepts — Premium, Comfort and Budget.

Premium will be similar to today’s premium economy product, which comes with a 19-inch width, and is aimed at business and wealthy leisure travellers.

Comfort will be roughly akin to today’s standard economy product, and will have an 18-inch wide seat and is for cost-conscious passengers.

Budget, or “economy minus” as some cynics describe it, will on Airbus’ upcoming 11-across A380 also have an 18-inch wide seat but narrower armrests. On other plane types the seat might be slimmer still.

Airbus announced the new products at an aviation trade show in Hamburg today. No information on seat pitch was given as this will likely be set by each airline.

Some years away: A380 11-across seating

Another display showed the 11-across A380 economy class configuration, which was first revealed a year ago (see news, March 2014).

Eighteen months ago, in an attempt to score points over rival Boeing, Airbus called for the airline industry to adopt a minimum 18-inch seat width in economy class (see news, October 2013).

Airbus’ intentions may have been good but, at the end of the day, the airlines (the ones who determine the seating layouts) are the customers and Airbus must dance to their tune.

And so that is how it has turned out. With today’s hugely varying marketplaces, fares and yields, no single carrier can afford to offer more comfort than another.

It appears that Airbus now accepts this fact. Right now, most Airbus planes offer better comfort than those manufactured by Boeing.

But things are set to change in future years. Increasing numbers of airlines are squeezing in more and more passengers to drive “yield” or revenue per seat.

The revenue gains are significant. Taking a four-class A380 with 11-across economy seating, the extra revenue per airline would be US$20 million per aircraft per year, according to Airbus.

But the 11-across A380 is some years away. Right now, most carriers are moving to ten-across layouts on their Boeing B777s while almost all carriers retain eight-across seating on their Airbus A330s and A340s (the equivalent Airbus products).

So, advantage Airbus. But although all carriers have gone nine-across on their new B787s and A350s, chances are that some will move to ten-across seating on the latter in future years. (Budget carrier Air AsiaX has already said it will go 10-across on its A350s.)

However, ten-across seating will not be possible on the B787 on account of its slimmer cabin.

Those few carriers, like Air AsiaX, Cebu Pacific and PAL, who have moved to nine-across on their A330s are mainly based in Asia. In that region, price tends to matter more than comfort and where a new generation of travellers is taking to the air for the first time.

It is becoming clear that in future there will be no single economy class. The standard product as we know it today is on the way out.

In future, travellers will have a choice of products each with its own price point, so better comfort will be available but expect to pay for it.

Subscribers can read our Feel the Squeeze feature on long-haul economy in the March issue of Business Traveller. Also, look out for a premium economy feature in the forthcoming June issue.

Well, it would be unsurprising if Airbus didn’t respond – and they have with the Airbus Pivot bin.

Originally announced in September 2014, this is a line fit/retrofit product that can be installed aboard the A320 family aircraft.

Here’s the rendering:



Airbus Pivot Bin aboard the A320neo – Rendering Airbus

But how does it look in the real world?



Airbus Pivot Bin in the closed position, Airbus stand at AIX2015.



Airbus Pivot bin in the open position – four identical bags loaded. Airbus stand at AIX2015.

Again, this an overhead bin that will have bags on their sides as opposed to flat back, and passengers stow them as such.

The bins offer more space – around 10% more space than the current shelf style bins being deployed on aircraft. Of course with the luggage stored a bit more optimally – Airbus thinks this will be more like 60% extra space

In terms of looks, they look like most modern pivot bins – curved and blended into the cabin as opposed to the usual stick-out. Also, airlines seems to love curves in the cabin as it gives the illusion of additional space.

Delta will be the launch customer of these pivot style bins, which will fly from early 2016 onwards aboard new Airbus A321 aircraft.

It’s welcome to see these new designs enter the market – and hopefully be fitted on more planes. The only problem – and it’s the same with the Boeing Space Bin – is that all the mockups and demonstration units so far have used the same size peice of luggage in a bin.

And the real world doesn’t work like that. We all have different sized rollaboard bags (or in your writers case, a rucksack) that bulge in different ways.

How these bins will work in the real world will be the acid test.

Douglas’ comments are illuminating, as flight frequency has proven to be an important factor for passengers. By offering multiple flight times, travellers benefit from increased flexibility and are thus able to schedule their travel conveniently. One of the high-density routes here in Asia is Hong Kong to Singapore. Cathay Pacific (CX) and Singapore Airlines (SIA) alone operate 15 return daily nonstop services. While SIA flies the A380 once daily on the route, CX does boast more frequencies between the two cities. In particular, the Hong Kong-based carrier is the only one to offer a red-eye flight to Singapore – one that is attractive to business travellers who want to get a full day in the Lion City.Ten reasons to love the A380 Another point of contention is the fuel efficiency of the A380, as the superjumbo only becomes a cost-saving aircraft at full capacity.

French Gendarmerie describe recovery operation following Germanwings crash - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZnJlbmNoZ2VuZGFybWVyaWVkZXNjcmliZXJlY292ZXJ5b3BlcmF0aW9uZm9sbG93aW5nZ2VybWFud2luL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On March 24, Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, near the Tête du Travers summit , killing all 150 people on board. Up to 17 helicopters worked at the scene as recovery work began.

When Lieutenant Colonel Laurent Le Goff first flew over the remote part of the French Alps into which the Germanwings Airbus A320 had crashed just a few hours earlier, he noticed something odd. “Where is the plane’s wreckage?” he asked his Gendarmerie colleagues. There was no evidence of an impact below them, and while there was a scattering of debris, none of it was of a significant size. The aircraft — which had been en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, with 144 passengers and six crew — was simply pulverized as it hit the mountain at an estimated 430 mph (700 km/h).

The first helicopter on site had flown from the Gendarmerie air base at nearby Digne after the order came in from France’s military air control center in Lyon. It received the call on March 24 at 10:55 a.m. (local time), took off at 11:00, and found the remains of the plane at 11:07.

As more resources arrived in the region, Le Goff, chief of staff of the Forces aériennes de la Gendarmerie Nationale (the Gendarmerie air force), worked to coordinate helicopter missions to the almost-inaccessible crash site, which was below the Tête du Travers summit, at around 5,000 feet. The helicopters involved in the recovery operation were based at a small airfield in Seyne-les-Alpes, southeast France, which is usually a base for gliders.

In total, there were up to 17 helicopters on the airfield on the day of the crash. Among them were two Airbus Helicopters EC145s from the Sécurité Civile emergency preparedness organization, an Airbus Helicopters SA330 Puma from the French Army, an Airbus Helicopters AS532 Cougar from the French Air Force, and a commercial emergency medical services helicopter, which had all been called in the hope that survivors might be found. Such hopes quickly vanished.

The Gendarmerie had seven helicopters participating in the recovery operation, which arrived from various bases around the country. In addition to the Digne-based EC145 that discovered the wreckage, another three EC145s arrived from Briançon (in southeastern France), where they had been conducting mountain training. Another one came from Lyon (east-central France). The last EC145 came from Paris, bringing personnel and DNA identification kits. Finally, one Airbus Helicopters EC135 came from Hyères (also in southeastern France).

From Wednesday, March 25, there were only four helicopters, all Gendarmerie-operated, remaining on site — three EC145s and one EC135.

In addition to seven Gendarmerie helicopters, a French Army SA 300 Puma and French Air Force AS532 Cougar were based at a small airfield in Seyne-les-Alpes, from where the recovery operation was coordinated.

The EC145s were in charge of hoisting investigators to and from the crash site, in addition to carrying out the remains of the A320’s passengers and crew; the personnel working on the crash site were almost entirely dedicated to collecting human remains. The only debris from the aircraft itself that was considered for recovery were the cockpit voice recorder (which was found two days after the crash) and the flight data recorder (for which the investigators are still searching). The Gendarmerie also carried the seven agents the BEA (the French air accident investigation agency) sent on site for their safety investigation.

The EC135, equipped with a Wescam camera, had a reconnaissance and information-gathering role (such as transmitting images to the Ministry of the Interior in Paris). LeGoff said the aircraft also had an important role to play when the heads of state — from France, Spain and Germany — came to visit the site, as it served to secure the convoy. Finally, the EC135 carried the photographers and cameramen of the Ministry of the Interior’s communications team.

A Challenging Environment





The surroundings of the crash site were so rocky and steep that the EC145s could not land or even lay a skid on the ground to embark or disembark passengers; therefore, all operations involved hoisting. Hoists were used at a height of 50 to 60 meters (160 to 200 feet), and took place close to the investigation scene, but not directly above it. The idea was to avoid having the aircraft’s downwash dispersing or contaminating evidence.

With the crash site spread over 400 meters (1,300 feet) in height, two working areas were defined — a higher area and a lower area. The Mariaud pass was used as a base camp to regroup staff and litters to be hoisted back. Although the use of litters were not strictly necessary, their use was considered appropriate because they were carrying a human load.

Airbus president and CEO Fabrice Brégier arrives at Seyne-les-Alpes, France.





A technical briefing took place every day early in the morning so that operations could start right after sunrise. The end of the working day was at about 5:30 p.m., when personnel were hoisted back to Seyne-les-Alpes. As most investigators were not used to a mountainous environment and were not familiar with hoisting, they worked in pairs with specialist gendarmes who regularly rescue skiers and climbers.

The main difficulty was the geographic environment, which included steep glens and ridges. Atmospheric conditions were tough, too, with strong winds (up to 100 km/h) and turbulence, which occasionally caused flights to be suspended. Even the lighting conditions were challenging — at certain times of the day, there were stark contrasts between sun and shade.

“Mountain flying techniques are complex and an additional dimension, this time, was the massive number of hoisting operations we conducted,” Le Goff said. The top priority was the safety of all personnel, especially as there were, unfortunately, no crash survivors to rescue.

The aircraft crews consisted of one pilot and one on-board technician, who was in charge of navigation assistance (such as watching traffic and obstacle avoidance), hoisting, and some maintenance on the ground. For safety reasons, a decision was made to fly with a light payload. Therefore, the number of passengers was limited to four — two pairs of investigators and mountain specialists. The quantity of fuel was also limited, but two small fuel trucks were available nearby thanks to the interrupted mountain flight training session in Briançon. Each could carry 2,000 liters (528 U.S. gallons), which made on-site refueling easier. Over the first five days of the recovery operation, 10,000 liters (2,642 U.S. gallons) of fuel was consumed.

As for maintenance, each on-board technician was taking care of his hoist, which required servicing every 100 cycles.

The crash site was so steep and rocky that the only way in and out was by helicopter hoist, which was conducted by Gendarmerie EC145s.





There were 11 pilots and 11 technicians involved in the operation. As they were military staff, there was no flight time limitation, and each helicopter flew four or five hours each day. The flight time to the crash site was just four minutes, which gives an idea of the number of return flights the aircraft completed each day.

Coordination of the aircraft involved in the mission was mainly about safety and avoiding traffic collisions. All helicopters were therefore required to depart and approach following a virtual line between two villages — Seyne-les-Alpes and Vernet. Depending on the wind conditions, they had to keep the virtual line on their left-hand or right-hand side, Le Goff explained. All helicopters working on site were asked to use the so-called mountain radio-frequency, 130.00 MHz.

The Gendarmerie used all its skills at unprecedented scale, and Le Goff therefore expects the experience to provide useful feedback for the organization’s future operations.

Since Sunday, March 29, there have been just two EC145s operating on the crash site, flying in from their respective bases in Digne and Briançon. They keep availability for other missions, such as responding to mountain rescue calls, and will not be involved in recovering aircraft debris.

Two German Bell UH-1D military helicopters are set to join the effort in Seyne-les-Alpes on April 3. The framework is a “technical and operational collaboration” with Germany, especially as the German minister of Interior is to visit the site on that day.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999350309371948}",neutral,0.9999350309371948,0

He's fresh from a visit to Franco-German aviation giant Airbus' Toulouse headquarters.

Airbus executives rolled out the red carpet for Narendra Modi on Saturday, showing the visiting prime minister the flagship A380, a plane that frequently flies to India but is not currently used by any domestic carrier.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Airbus executives Tom Enders and Fabrice Brégier accompanied Modi on his tour of the facility. On Friday, after arriving in France, Modi unveiled plans to purchase 36 French-built Rafale fighter jets, in a deal worth some 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion). India thus becomes the second foreign government, after Egypt, to sign up for the new fighters.

Airbus looking to produce in India

The aviation giant also issued a statement after the tour, reaffirming its ""commitment to produce in India,"" echoing the chosen theme of Modi's European tour, where he's promoting a ""Make in India"" campaign seeking international outsourcing projects.

""India already plays an important role in our international activities and we even want to increase its contribution to our products,"" Enders told the press.

Airbus' comments also pointed to the existing ""two engineering centers, one research and technology center in India, employing a total of 400 highly-qualified people,"" saying these efforts already represented an investment of $400 million per year, ""providing a living to 5,000 staff from 40 companies.""

Indian airlines have purchased around 800 Airbus passenger planes since 2005, a major recent order from November 2014 was an order for 250 of the A320neo model for low-cost carrier Indigo.

Fabrice Brégier, executive president of Airbus' commercial arm, said that he was ""sure that one day there will also be an Indian company that will fly with an A380 in its colors.""

Modi and Merkel will share the stage as the Hannover Messe officially opens

'Hannover Messe' and Merkel next

On Sunday evening, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Modi are scheduled to jointly open the ""Hannover Messe"" - Germany and the world's biggest industrial trade fair.

India is the 2015 official partner country of the annual fair, which is open from April 13 to April 17 in Hanover. Some 6,500 companies from around 70 countries will be showcasing their wares in the northern German city.

Airbus A380 haunted by lack of orders as it marks decade in the skies - The National,"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaGF1bnRlZC1ieS1sYWNrLW9mLW9yZGVycy1hcy1pdC1tYXJrcy1kZWNhZGUtaW4tdGhlLXNraWVzLTEuMjE2NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the tender age of 10, the Airbus A380 is already entering a mid-life crisis.

The double-decker aircraft has failed to win a single order from any new airline customer for two years now, and senior management was forced to come to the airliner’s defence in December after the planemaker’s parent introduced the possibility of axing the A380 outright. As the mid point of the year approaches, the plane has yet again drawn a blank on deals.

It’s a far cry from the jubilations in 2005, when the giant airliner took off for the first time, hailed as the star of 21st century aviation. Airbus said the A380, certified to carry as many as 853 passengers, would push arch-rival Boeing out of the monopoly on jumbo jets it held for decades and herald a new dawn of travel, pairing ultra-luxury with mass transport while alleviating the strain on congested airports.

“It’s true the market hasn’t developed as much as we’d have liked,” Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier said this month. “This plane was probably launched 10 years too early.”

Mr Bregier is now trying to breathe fresh life into the A380 campaign. Airbus has assembled a team of employees from within sales, marketing, engineering and design to lobby existing and future customers of the aircraft — including those who may buy the aircraft second-hand.

Airbus said the “new organisation will enhance our ability to respond to market trends and customer needs quicker, by developing and deploying complete solutions faster — in order to explore and open up new market segments,” the company said in response to questions.

The lack of commercial success lies in part in a misuse of the A380’s basic purpose. When Airbus introduced the plane, it was touted as the ideal response to crowded skies, with airlines benefiting from scale and better economics by packing in more seats. Instead, carriers used the vast real estate to embrace custom extravagances including bars, showers and duty-free shopping zones, turning many A380s more into exotic luxury liners rather than vehicles of mass transportation.

Airbus wants customers to re-discover the A380 as a work horse, encouraging existing and prospective buyers to use denser configurations, seating 11-abreast instead of 10 in economy, while still exploiting the cabin’s size to keep perks like bars that distinguish the plane. The company has lifted standard seat capacity to 544 in a bid to pull customers along.

It’s already helped Qantas Airways move in that direction and Singapore Airlines is now refurbishing its 19 A380s to add premium economy seats. Emirates, the A380’s biggest operator with 60 in use and another 80 on order, has some double-deckers flying in a two-class layout for 615 seats, stripping out its first-class berths.

Since 2000, the A380 has won just 317 orders, less than a third of the 1,200 Airbus projected in its first 20 years. Not a single US airline has ordered it, and only five have been contracted for China, which will be the world’s largest aviation market in 20 years.

By contrast, the two-engine A350 that Airbus introduced in 2006 had secured 780 orders by the time it first entered service early this year. To be sure, the Boeing 747-8, the latest iteration of the US manufacturer’s largest plane, has fared far worse than the A380, with Boeing cutting production to adapt.

The tepid response has haunted Airbus, particularly since the A380 is a hit with the flying public. The ride is smooth and quiet, and perks like bars where business-class passengers can mingle on Emirates planes have created buzz. Etihad Airways has gone as far as fitting a three-room residence into the front of its A380s, complete with a bed and a butler.

The success of large and efficient two-engine aircraft has made marketing of more fuel-intensive four-engine models a harder task. Boeing's 777 wide-body, powered by two of the world's largest commercial jetliner engines, has been wildly successful with customers, while Airbus was forced to bury its four-turbine A340 model conceived for ultra-long routes. Even with cheap oil, fuel costs remain the single-biggest expense for airlines and cutting the fuel bill is a major incentive.

One modest success that Airbus aims to celebrate this year is no longer producing each A380 at a loss, though admits the overall programme itself will never recoup its US$25 billion investment.

So long as Airbus can persuade the parent company to ride out the current order dearth, the A380 has a chance to find a new generation of buyers attracted by the plane’s economics. That at least is the view of John Leahy, the 64-year-old Airbus salesman who’s sold more than 12,000 planes in two decades.

“This programme will be around for 40 to 50 years,” Mr Leahy said in a promotional video Airbus released for the anniversary. “No doubt in my mind about that.”

Cramping Your Style — Airplanes Are About to Get A Lot Smaller - Yahoo! Voices,"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvY3JhbXBpbmctbXktc3R5bGUtYWlycGxhbmVzLWFib3V0LXRvLWdldC1hLWxvdC0xMTU4NjE3MzEwMzcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus both have plans to release planes with more seats and less legroom. (Photos: Boeing and Airbus)

If it wasn’t clear how airlines felt about their passengers, it is now: They hate us.

Airlines are lining up to purchase new planes from Boeing and Airbus, which in addition to being more fuel-efficient, will also feature more seats in the airplanes’ cabins. Translation —your flights are about to get a lot more cramped.

Boeing’s 737 MAX is due to enter service in 2017, and plans to feature 189 seats (currently the Boeing 737-800 has about 160 seats). Ryanair called in a special request and asked that 11 additional seats be added to create a model called the 737 MAX 200 (because it has 200 seats!).

The low cost airline has already placed an $11 billion order for 100 of the new planes. “It means that we are going to expand and grow very strongly in Europe, both in new markets and in going in and taking traffic away from incumbent carriers,” said Michael O’Leary, CEO of Ryanair. “I hope it will hasten in an era of a new price war in Europe over the next 10 years.”

Not to be outdone, the Airbus A320neo is set to be released in late 2016 and was intended to come with 180 seats. But just last month, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave permission to add 15 additional seats, bringing passenger capacity to 195.

So how are these seats going to feel? Seat pitch is the distance from any point on one seat to the exact same point on the seat in front of you. It’s not a perfect science, but can help you estimate the amount of legroom to expect.



As of now the Boeing 737 MAX 200 plans to have a seat pitch of 29 or 30 inches. For comparison, current models of the popular Boeing 737-800 have a seat pitch of 31 in their economy classes.

The Airbus 320neo is a shorter aircraft is expected to have a seat pitch of just 27 inches. This compares to the widely used Airbus 320 which has about 150 seats and a pitch of 30-32 depending on the carrier.

So unless humans start getting shorter, the future of flying is looking a lot more uncomfortable.

INTERIORS: Airbus gains traction with Space-Flex concept - Flightglobal,"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW50ZXJpb3JzLWFpcmJ1cy1nYWlucy10cmFjdGlvbi13aXRoLXNwYWNlLWZsZXgtY29uY2VwdC8xMTYyNDQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over the decades, cabin designers have become increasingly adept at squeezing a quart into a pint pot. For metric users that is the equivalent of compressing 1.136 litres into a 568ml container – well, nobody ever claimed that British Imperial measures were particularly logical, but you get the idea.

Airbus’s Space-Flex attempts to do more with less by making more efficient use of the space at the rear of the cabin. It replaces an A320-family aircraft's full-width rear galley with a smaller unit that occupies around one-third of the aft-facing surface, with the remainder of the space taken up by one or two lavatories.

This allows the two lavatories that are usually located on either side of the central aisle to be removed. The space liberated allows airlines to do one of two things: either give passengers a little extra legroom throughout the cabin… or to install up to three additional revenue-generating seats.

Airbus says that, so far at least, airlines that have specified Space-Flex have opted for the increased legroom option. However, do not be surprised if some carriers choose the higher capacity option.

Airbus says that the new lavatories with Space-Flex are larger than those on rival aircraft. The can also be configured to offer a full persons with reduced mobility (PRM) lavatory for the first time on a single-aisle aircraft. The larger, PRM-friendly model is installed by a simple process that converts the two single Space-Flex lavatories into one PRM unit.

Space-Flex concept

Airbus

Space-Flex remains an optional configuration, but Airbus believes there will be a growing trend towards its uptake. Given the move by airlines in recent years to install slimmer seats so as to fit additional passengers into the space available, this seems a reasonable assumption on the part of the airframer.

European low-cost carrier Vueling took delivery ofits first A320 incorporating Space-Flex on 16 March. Configured in a single-class 186-seat layout, the A320 is the first of a 62 new narrowbodies due to be delivered to the carrier in coming years.

“We foresee a growing popularity for Space-Flex as it is a key enabler for more seats in the cabin,” says Airbus. “Since the launch of the A320’s increased exit limit, 70% of low-cost carriers/charter operators, having done their definition, have selected Space-Flex.”

Space-Flex v1 entered service at the end of 2013 with South American airline group LATAM. From 2014, Airbus offered a new version, Space-Flex v2, which will enter service in 2016. The v2 variant will give increased galley capacity: “It will offer additional trolley capacity with eight half-size trolleys or three full-size trolleys plus two half-size trolleys, while maintaining a PRM-capable lavatory, Airbus says.

Unsurprisingly, Airbus sought assistance from airlines on Space-Flex, both in validating the basic concept and then, at a later stage of the design, in fine-tuning volume and space allocation for the various components of the integrated unit. It was prompting from airlines that brought about the v2 version of the unit, as some carriers indicated that they needed to have greater trolley capacity, important when dealing with higher-density seating configurations.

The v2 version “builds on the in-service experience from Space-Flex v1”, says Airbus. “We believe that we have reached a solution that meets airline requirements and a complementary offer with either full PRM or simple PRM solution.”

Another proposed Airbus cabin option is still being considered by carriers. The manufacturer suggested in 2014 that it could provide cabins with varying seat widths. Some seats on the aisle could be made wider, at the expense of the other two places in a typical A320 row, to accommodate larger passengers. Needless to say, they would pay extra for the privilege.

“The Extra Wide Seat was presented as an idea to benefit from the A320 wider cross-section and offer airlines the opportunity for ancillary revenue generation,” Airbus says. “A lot of airlines have shown interest in this concept so far, even if no one has selected it yet.”

Whether this is because airlines think the Extra Wide Seat is unnecessary or because they do not want to irritate the passengers in the other, narrower seats is not clear.

"Pontifications: Meet the ""A320neo MAX 195"" - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 06 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNC8wNi9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1tZWV0LXRoZS1hMzIwbmVvLW1heC0xOTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 6, 2015: There is a saying in America: keeping up with the Joneses.

This means that if your neighbor buys something, you have to go buy something similar to “keep up.”

In the case of commercial aviation, Keeping Up with the Jones has been an international past time for decades. Boeing developed the 247. Douglas developed the DC-2. Douglas developed the DC-4. Lockheed developed the Constellation. The DC-6 begot an improved Connie which prompted the DC-7 which in turn prompted the 1649 Connie. Boeing developed the 707 and Douglas the DC-8. And so it goes today, with the tit-for-tat between Airbus and Boeing.

So the latest: Boeing 737 Max 200, meet the Airbus “A320 Max 195.”

That gnashing of teeth you hear is coming from Toulouse not only at the characterization but also the label.

Last month Airbus received certification for a 195-passenger configuration for the A320neo. This compares to the 737 Max 200, designed for 200 passengers (but in practice, more likely 194-197).

.

When I heard of the “A320 Max 195,” thanks to a story by Mary Kirby of Runway Girl Network, my mind boggled. The A320 is shorter than the 737-800/8 and Airbus had to creatively struggle to find a Layout ofPassenger Accommodations (LOPA) to bring seating to 189, using 28-inch pitch and smaller and fewer lavs and galleys. How in the world could Airbus fit another six seats into the airplane?

I could scarcely hide my incredulity when I queried Toulouse.

“Following successful evacuation tests performed in 2014, Airworthiness Authorities have granted us with an enhanced egress rate that applies to the existing forward and aft doors of the whole A320 Family,” an Airbus spokesman said in an email. “This has allowed us, [last] month, to certify the A320 with an envelope of 195 pax, providing us margin for future cabin developments. All the enablers we have today allow us to market up to 189 pax on the A320 but, to answer market needs, we keep looking at innovative ways to add more revenue seats at equivalent comfort standard.

“[The] 195 pax is just a theoretical certified envelope, based on our new overall doors’ rating and on the A320 bearable structural loads constraints,” Airbus said. (Emphasis is theirs.) “This gives us margin for future cabin developments but is not specifically linked to an existing LOPA. [A]ll the enablers we have today allow us to market up to 189 pax on the A320 but we keep looking at innovative ways to add more revenue seats at equivalent comfort standard.”

In this case, Airbus would have to use a 27-inch seat pitch (seat maker Zodiac already has a design).

Mary Kirby posted this video: and had this story about Zodiac’s design and the 195-seat A320.

“Of course, one needs to put everything into perspective,” Airbus continued. “An A320 in a theoretically possible 195 seats layout would be for special ‘high-density’ configurations for airlines who want it for certain markets with certain business models. But obviously if a passenger pays a full-fare mainline ticket he or she would not expect to be sitting at 27inch pitch. On the other hand, if a backpacker just wants to ‘get around’ at the lowest possible cost, then even at 27 inch pitch (in a new-gen-seat 18-inch wide in an A320) that will likely be much more comfortable than the bus or train they subsequently take to their sightseeing tour. In short, nobody is forcing anybody to do anything – it’s just a question of what’s possible to offer customers. And the market – ie you the passenger, at the end of the day – is free to decide what they buy.”

Well.

I could see airlines like Ryanair or Spirit Air, neither of which is particularly concerned about what the passenger wants or doesn’t want, presenting what essentially is a take-it-or-leave-it fleet-wide configuration like this. Imagine trying to evacuate a 195-seat A320 (or a 200 seat MAX, for that matter) in 90 seconds. With seat pitch like that, and the growing population of, shall we say, plus-size people, it might take 90 seconds just to get out of the damn seats let alone to the exits.

But Boeing has a 200 seat 737-8. To Keep Up with the Joneses, Airbus now has a 195 seat A320neo.

Revolution in cockpit design inspired by...IKEA? - USA TODAY,"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvcm9hZHdhcnJpb3J2b2ljZXMvMjAxNS8wNC8zMC9yZXZvbHV0aW9uLWluLWNvY2twaXQtZGVzaWduLWluc3BpcmVkLWJ5LWlrZWEvODMzMDg5Njgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Revolution in cockpit design inspired by...IKEA?

Inspiration never comes among philosophers in gardens anymore. For Airbus systems designer Raphael Andre, inspiration struck along the floor arrows at the IKEA in Toulouse, France. Looking at all the cheap, flat-back, DIY, furniture, it suddenly dawned on Andre that the same approach would work just as well in cockpit design. Bringing his idea to the Airbus ProtoSpace in Toulouse, where innovators are encouraged and enabled to work, Andre and colleague Laurent Saint-Marc put together the prototype of the ""flat-pack cockpit kit.""

Although it doesn’t look like much, the project became an almost instant success with plane designers, who loved the easy, throw-together set up, in distinct contrast to the usual months it takes to mock-up a full simulator. With new technologies, systems, and innovations coming in fast, the flat-pack cockpit kit lets cockpit designers quickly build and test them. It’s already seen action in the development of the superjumbo A380 and is now crossing over into the automobile industry, as a tester of dashboard interiors.

Andre’s invention also comes at a time when cockpit design is under close analysis, especially following this year’s Germanwings crash, and Air France Flight 447 in 2009 — both attributed in part to cockpit design. Plus, with planes virtually able to fly themselves these days, the role and position of the pilot is a big part of the debate.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8965125679969788}",neutral,0.8965125679969788,0
Airbus gets its heavyweight Airbus A330 certified by EASA... and plots the path to the A330neo - Economy Class ... - Kevin Marshall,"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMTUvMDQvMDIvYWlyYnVzLWdldHMtaXRzLWhlYXZ5d2VpZ2h0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLWNlcnRpZmllZC1ieS1lYXNhLWFuZC1wbG90cy10aGUtcGF0aC10by10aGUtYTMzMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has had its heavyweight Airbus A330-300 certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency yesterday, paving the way for the introduction of the latest variant of the Airbus A330.



Delta Airbus A330-300 242T Rolls out – Image, Airbus

This heavyweight variant of the A330-300 is rather important – least of all for its 242 tonne Maximum Take-off weight limit. As well as allowing for a higher take-off weight, it also updates the aerodynamic package, engine improvements and a 2% fuel reduction.

More importantly, this sets the foundation for the A330neo (new engine option) project, as Airbus will be using the A330 242T as is development base for the A330neo.

The first of the A330 242T’s will be an A330-300 powered by GE CF6 engines. Airbus will be working to certify its A330-200 aircraft (the range optimised version of the A330), along with engines from Rolls-Royce (Trent 700 engines) and Pratt & Whitney (The PW400 series engines).

With EASA certifying the A330-300 242T version, it now falls to the other major agency – the US Federal Aviation Administration to certify this heavyweight aircraft.

As you can see from the lovely picture provided by Airbus, Delta will be the first operator of this new variant of the A330 during 2015. A total of 11 operators have this updated on order.

It’s good to see aircraft evolve and change – showing there is life in a design that rolled out in 1992, and first flew commercially in 1994.

And with the A330neo on the horizon, the evolve and change. All those nips, tucks and changes will hopefully lead to improved performance and lower operating costs.

And for passengers – hopefully lower fares.

Airbus A380 haunted by feeble orders marks decade in skies | Mint - Mint,"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvVENKd2lLa0VpckZlbld6WXk0Zks2Sy9BaXJidXMtQTM4MC1oYXVudGVkLWJ5LWZlZWJsZS1vcmRlcnMtbWFya3MtZGVjYWRlLWluLXNraWVzLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy9UQ0p3aUtrRWlyRmVuV3pZeTRmSzZLL0FpcmJ1cy1BMzgwLWhhdW50ZWQtYnktZmVlYmxlLW9yZGVycy1tYXJrcy1kZWNhZGUtaW4tc2tpZXMuaHRtbD9mYWNldD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The double-decker aircraft has failed to win a single order from any new airline customer for two years now, and senior management was forced to come to the airliner’s defence in December after the planemaker’s parent introduced the possibility of axing the A380 outright. As the mid point of the year approaches, the plane has yet again drawn a blank on deals.

It’s a far cry from the jubilations in 2005, when the giant airliner took off for the first time, hailed as the star of 21st century aviation. Airbus said the A380, certified to carry as many as 853 passengers, would push arch-rival Boeing Co. out of the monopoly on jumbo jets it held for decades and herald a new dawn of travel, pairing ultra-luxury with mass transport while alleviating the strain on congested airports.

“It’s true the market hasn’t developed as much as we’d have liked,"" Airbus chief executive officer Fabrice Bregier said this month. “This plane was probably launched 10 years too early.""

Bregier is now trying to breathe fresh life into the A380 campaign. Airbus has assembled a team of employees from within sales, marketing, engineering and design to lobby existing and future customers of the aircraft—including those who may buy the plane second-hand.

Adding seats

The “new organization will enhance our ability to respond to market trends and customer needs quicker, by developing and deploying complete solutions faster—in order to explore and open up new market segments,"" Airbus said in response to questions.

One possible way to rekindle demand is to fit the aircraft with new engines, a project championed by Emirates president Tim Clark, who has said he’d be in the market for as many as another 200 A380s should Airbus take the step. For now, Airbus is more focused on incremental improvements in aerodynamics and the engines, saying the business case must be clear before investing as much as €2 billion ($2.2 billion) to fit new engines.

The lacklustre commercial success lies in part in a misuse of the A380’s basic purpose. When Airbus introduced the plane, it was touted as the ideal response to crowded skies, with airlines benefiting from scale and better economics by packing in more seats. Instead, carriers used the vast real estate to embrace custom extravagances including bars, showers and duty- free shopping zones, turning many A380s more into exotic luxury liners rather than vehicles of mass transportation.

Airbus wants customers to rediscover the A380 as a work horse, encouraging existing and prospective buyers to use denser configurations, seating 11-abreast instead of 10 in economy, while still exploiting the cabin’s size to keep perks like bars that distinguish the plane. The company has lifted standard seat capacity to 544 in a bid to pull customers along.

Two-class layout

It’s already helped Qantas Airways move in that direction and Singapore Airlines Ltd is now refurbishing its 19 A380s to add premium economy seats. Emirates, the A380’s biggest operator with 60 in use and another 80 on order, plans by year-end to have some double-deckers flying in a two-class layout for 615 seats, stripping out its first-class berths.

Since 2000, the A380 has won just 317 orders, less than a third of the 1,200 Airbus projected in its first 20 years. Not a single US airline has ordered it, and only five have been contracted for China, which will be the world’s largest aviation market in 20 years.

By contrast, the two-engine A350 that Airbus introduced in 2006 had secured 780 orders by the time it first entered service early this year. To be sure, the Boeing 747-8, the latest iteration of the US manufacturer’s largest plane, has fared far worse than the A380, with Boeing cutting production to adapt.

Creating buzz

The tepid response has haunted Airbus, particularly since the A380 is a hit with the flying public. The ride is smooth and quiet, and perks like bars where business-class passengers can mingle on Emirates planes have created buzz. Etihad Airways PJSC has gone as far as fitting a three-room residence into the front of its A380s, complete with a bed and a butler.

The success of large and efficient two-engine aircraft has made marketing of more fuel-intensive four-engine models a harder task. Boeing’s 777 wide-body, powered by two of the world’s largest commercial jetliner engines, has been wildly successful with customers, while Airbus was forced to bury its four-turbine A340 model conceived for ultra-long routes. Even with cheap oil, fuel costs remain the single-biggest expense for airlines and cutting the fuel bill is a major incentive.

One modest success that Airbus aims to celebrate this year is that it no longer produces each A380 at a loss, though the company admits the overall program itself will never recoup its $25 billion investment.

So long as Airbus can persuade the parent company to ride out the current order dearth, the A380 has a chance to find a new generation of buyers attracted by the plane’s economics. That at least is the view of John Leahy, the 64-year-old Airbus salesman who’s sold more than 12,000 planes in two decades.

“This program will be around for 40 to 50 years,"" Leahy said in a promotional video Airbus released for the anniversary. “No doubt in my mind about that."" Bloomberg

"Those confusing aircraft seat measurements, explained - Runway Girl Network","Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDQvdGhvc2UtY29uZnVzaW5nLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXNlYXQtbWVhc3VyZW1lbnRzLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How wide is your airline seat? The answer to that question depends on another question: what are you measuring?

It’s an important question, because the difference can be as much as two full inches — the difference between an ultra-narrow, high-density seat on a nine-abreast A330 operated by AirAsia X, Air Transat or Cebu Pacific and the most spacious economy seats around on an eight-abreast 787 or 10-abreast A380.

The crux of the issue — explosively flagged at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg by both Airbus (in its 3-5-3 Airbus A380) and all-Boeing operator Southwest Airlines (with its new post-Evolve seat) is that seatmakers, airlines and airframers use one of three different measurements of seat width depending on what point they’re attempting to make. Here’s an illustration:

Which of B or C is the width of a seat? When it comes to measuring larger passengers, most airlines will take B, the “inside the armrests measurement” (and decide whether you need to buy a second seat based on, among other factors, whether you can put the armrest down).

But are they actually quoting C – the “half an armrest either side” option – on their websites and press releases? Or, even more questionably, are they measuring a notional specification D, double-counting each armrest? Discounting D as a blatant cheat, we’re left with two options.

The B measurement would seem to be the most reasonable. After all, only the skinniest passenger with a mere modicum of body fat doesn’t experience a little bit of hip spread when seated, and the width of an armrest is a reasonable amount of leeway.

The problem with using measurement B on its own, however, is that it incentivizes airlines to narrow the armrest. Compare a seat from a 747 or an A320 from 20 or 30 years ago and after you stop goggling at the pneumatic headphone jack, you’ll note that the newer armrests are less bulky overall — and notably narrower. B also doesn’t measure the seat pan, which is either a plus or a minus depending on whether you’re an advocate for more actual room or better looking statistics.

So, how about measurement C? In C’s favour, it exactly splits up measurement A, the block of three seats that’s a typical comparator between seatmakers on a Boeing 737, Airbus A320 or as the three-block of a Boeing 777 or 787.

The problem with C is that it quite literally allows no wiggle room. If your thighs are as wide as C, you’re brushing up against that person next to you. Your level of comfort with that might well differ if it’s a 45-minute hop up the coast or a 14-hour ultra-longhaul flight between continents.

During my time as Director of Data at Routehappy, when we collated, categorised and ranked the world’s most detailed database of seat parameters, width was the perennial sticking point. We knew that, in a reverse Orwellian twist, wide seats were good, narrow seats bad, but the data were (and are) incredibly dirty: we didn’t know whether a source (however trustworthy) was measuring B, C, D or something entirely different.

“We have standards for pitch, but width is the new pitch and it’s the Wild West out there right now,” notes Routehappy data research manager – and fellow RGN contributor – Jason Rabinowitz.

The commercial aviation industry is at a turning point. Passengers aren’t getting smaller, and the 17-point-something inch measurement at shoulder level — which is, these days, the more generous C – is an extra small according to clothier Brooks Brothers’ sizing chart. To be blunt, how many people in 2015 wear an extra small?

It’s time to agree on one standard measurement for width. At the end of the day, it matters less whether the industry chooses B or C — but it’s time to choose, to state measurements clearly and openly, and to provide options (such as the Airbus 20-17-17 A320 seat, Acro’s 18-19-18 A320 product or a Eurobusiness-style middle seat free purchase option) so that airlines and their passengers can make informed, responsible decisions about the amount of space they need.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

When contacted, an IndiGo spokesperson confirmed the deferment of aircraft deliveries.

“We currently have a fleet of 94 aircraft…… It will be 96 by the 3rd week of April 2015, the spokesperson told PTI in response to a query.

The airline, however, did not specify reasons for pushing back the delivery schedule.

The airline said it had added three aircraft between 20 February and 31 March this year, which took its fleet size to 94 planes.

Tiger Air, which is now majority-owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, had decided to sublease these planes to IndiGo as part of its capacity and cost management programme.

Airbus Photo

Airbus and Recaro Aircraft Seating plan to offer for the first time a “supplier-furnished-equipment” (SFE) Economy Class seat option for A320 Family operators. The proposed new seat, named “3530Swift”, is based on Recaro’s “BL3530” already developed for the A320 Family.

Showcased at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, the 3530Swift is planned to become available later this year, both in line-fit and retrofit. Up to now, all economy-class seats for the A320 Family are supplied as “buyer-furnished-equipment” (BFE). Being SFE, rather than BFE, the new seat would be available in predefined, pre-qualified and pre-certified Airbus layouts and catalogue configurations which would save considerable time normally required for individual product approval. The new SFE option would sit alongside the existing Airbus BFE product offering and the A320 Family’s BFE catalogue will continue to be updated.

“We are looking forward to being the first seat supplier to deliver SFE seats to Airbus for A320 Family customers,” says Dr. Mark Hiller, chief executive officer and shareholder of Recaro Aircraft Seating. “The Airbus decision to work with us to integrate our BL3530 as the basis for the new 3530Swift confirms our product strategy focusing on passenger comfort, lightweight design and efficiency. Our consistent performance in terms of process stability, product quality and reliable delivery also played a key role in the decision.”

“Airbus is very pleased to enter into this partnership with Recaro Aircraft Seating – and we are already working with them to bring our A320 Family customers an SFE economy seat option for the first time,” says Heino Ostermeier, Airbus’ senior vice president of cabin procurement. He adds: “We are confident that Recaro’s 3530Swift will be the right solution to meet the requirements which our customers expect, especially in terms of short lead times, an efficient selection of customization options, reliable scheduling and on-time delivery.”

Once it is fully available to order for the A320 Family, airlines would be able to customize the 3530Swift with various catalogue options which include leather dress covers, comfort cushions, more stowage space and a six-way adjustable headrest. Customers would also be able to select a tablet PC holder and tablet PC stowage, as well as a power socket for USB and PC. Moreover, the seat would take full advantage of A320’s wide cabin to offer a comfortable 18-inch width between armrests, while its excellent pitch efficiency will also enable airlines to install more rows in an aircraft whilst maintaining leg room.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998908042907715}",neutral,0.9998908042907715,0

The defence and space unit of Airbus has also plans to develop and manufacture electronic sensors with a partner in India, and has advanced discussions to support state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd’s combat aircraft programmes.

In a statement, Airbus said one of its units, Airbus Helicopters is in discussion with Indian companies to finalise teaming arrangements for various helicopter programmes, including the Naval Utility Helicopter, the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter as well as the Naval Multi-Role Helicopter competitions.

This was announced during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the Airbus production facilities in Toulouse on Saturday.

“India already takes a centre-stage role in our international activities and we want to even increase its contribution to our products. We support Prime Minister Modi’s ‘Make in India’ call and are ready to manufacture in India, for India and the world,"" said Airbus Group chief executive officer Tom Enders.

It was in April 1975, state-run Indian Airlines (now Air India Ltd) ordered three A300B2s, the first contract secured by Airbus in a country previously dominated by American aircraft manufacturers. Airbus had set up an Indian fully-owned subsidiary, Airbus India Operations, in December 2013.

In India, Airbus Group already operates two engineering centres — one focused on civil aviation and the other on defence — and a research and technology (R&T) centre which together employ over 400 people.

During the meeting with Modi, the Group’s senior representatives conveyed their decision to expand these centres so that they can take on comprehensive design responsibilities for future Airbus Group programmes.

At present, Airbus commands over 70% market share in the fleet of Indian scheduled airlines. In 2014, Airbus’ procurement from India stood at over $400 million from around 40 companies (public and private) which together support more than 5,000 jobs locally. The top three procurement areas have been in engineering & IT services, aero-structures, and detailed parts & systems.

“The prime minister was informed that procurement from the country is set to grow further as the Group plans to award additional manufacturing and engineering work packages to local companies, which will accelerate their integration into the Group’s global supply chain,"" Airbus said in a statement.

Airbus said it is willing to set-up final assembly lines and establish supply chains and related infrastructure for military transport aircraft and helicopters in the country. “These would be in full compliance of the procurement policies specified by the Indian Ministry of Defence and local Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) guidelines,"" it said.

Airbus’ defence and space had submitted a joint proposal with Tata Group to produce the modern C295 aircraft in India as a replacement for the ageing Avro aircraft of the Indian Air Force.

On 20 February, Mint reported that Airbus Group is in advanced talks with India’s largest engineering company Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) for setting up a radar manufacturing facility in India quoting Christian Scherer, executive vice-president (head of marketing and sales) and member of executive committee at Airbus Defence and Space GmbH.

Airbus also works directly with Indian companies in designing and manufacturing aerostructures.

These companies include Tata Group, Mahindra Group, Aequs Pvt Ltd, L&T, Dynamatic Technologies Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Geometric Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.

As of now, only four airlines have released details about their A350 aircraft: Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines. Qatar has already commenced A350 operations, while Cathay Pacific, Finnair and Vietnam Airlines are still awaiting delivery of their A350 aircraft.

Cathay Pacific: Cathay Pacific has a total of 48 A350 XWBs on order. 22 of the orders are for the -900 variant. These will be used to replace the Airbus A340-300 in Cathay’s fleet. The A340-300s mainly operated to Europe and Oceania. Cathay Pacific plans to take 12 of the -900s in 2016, while the remaining ten will be delivered in 2017. All of the -900s will be in an identical three-class configuration. The three classes will be business, premium economy, and economy class. The remaining 26 orders will be of the -1000 variant. This variant, the largest variant, will be used primarily to replace the Boeing 747-400. The role of the 747-400 in Cathay’s fleet was primarily a high-density, regional role. The -1000 will also fly higher capacity routes in North America. Cathay will take six A350-1000s in 2018, and ten each year in 2019 and 2020. Cathay Pacific plans to introduce a new business class seat and an enhanced premium economy seat on the A350 fleet.

Finnair: Finnair will take delivery of its first A350-900 XWB this fall. Finnair has a total of 19 A350-900XWB on order after just firming up an order for eight more. Before branching out to Asia, the A350 will be deployed throughout Europe from October 5th to the 15th. Beginning Oct. 25, the first A350 route to Asia will begin with a once daily service to Shanghai Pudong (PVG). On November 21st, the A350 will be deployed daily to Bejing Capital (PEK).

Asiana Airways plane hits communications tower at Hiroshima airport - The Guardian,"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L2Fwci8xNS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWFzaWFuYS1haXJ3YXlzLXBsYW5lLWhpdHMtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtdG93ZXItaGlyb3NoaW1h0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTUvYXByLzE1L2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tYXNpYW5hLWFpcndheXMtcGxhbmUtaGl0cy1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy10b3dlci1oaXJvc2hpbWE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



Aviation authorities in Japan and South Korea have launched an investigation after an Asiana Airways aircraft struck a communications tower as it came in to land in Hiroshima, leaving dozens of passengers with minor injuries.

The accident on Tuesday night bore similarities to a more serious accident involving the South Korean carrier in July 2013 that was blamed on pilot error.

Aerial footage released on Wednesday showed damage to the communications facility – a gate-like structure located some distance from the runway – at the airport in western Japan.

At least one large fragment of the tower, which sends signals to incoming planes, had broken off and come to rest on the tarmac, and wheel marks were visible on a grassy area in front of the runway. The tower’s antenna was stuck in one of the plane’s wheels, reports said.

Several hundred metres away, skid marks showed the Airbus A320 had careered off the runway and rotated more than 90 degrees before coming to a halt on a grass embankment.

Airport officials said the plane’s tail had touched the runway while landing, while its left wing and engine were also damaged.

Passengers aboard flight OZ162, which had begun its journey in Incheon, near Seoul, said panic had broken out in the cabin as the plane came in to land at about 8pm local time on Tuesday.

“There was smoke coming out and some of the oxygen masks fell down,” an unidentified female passenger told Japanese TV. “Cabin attendants were in such a panic and I thought we were going to die.”

Japan’s Kyodo news agency quoted another passenger as saying that the plane had bounced when it touched down, then skidded off the runway and stopped on the grass.

Another described seeing flames in the engine. The public broadcaster NHK quoted a passenger as saying smoke entered the cabin before the evacuation.

All 73 passengers and eight crew evacuated using escape chutes; 27 people, including two crew, sustained minor injuries, according to Japanese authorities. The airline, however, said 18 passengers had been hurt.

“We could … hear people shout ‘Hurry up before the plane explodes’. But the doors open and we swiftly got out and slid to the ground and felt a sense of relief. We thought it would explode so we were running away from the airplane,” a passenger told Japanese media.

An aviation safety official at the Japanese transport ministry said investigators had been sent to the scene to try to determine the cause of the accident.

Asiana Airways, meanwhile, said in a statement that it would work closely with aviation authorities. It added: “Asiana Airlines apologises for causing concern to the passengers and the people over the accident. [We] have immediately set up a response team to cope with the aftermath.”

An Asiana Airways Boeing 777 crashed two years ago after its tail clipped a seawall as it was coming in to the land at San Francisco’s airport, killing three teenagers and injuring 182 other passengers.

The South Korean transport ministry ordered a 45-day suspension of the airline’s service to San Francisco as a penalty.

The Trouble with Germanwings Flight 9525 - Geopoliticalmonitor.com,"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlb3BvbGl0aWNhbG1vbml0b3IuY29tL3RoZS10cm91YmxlLXdpdGgtZ2VybWFud2luZ3MtZmxpZ2h0LTk1MjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The reported discovery of the second “black box” of Germanwings Flight 9525, the Airbus 320 that crashed in the French Alps last month, appears to have put the Germanwings story to rest as far as the mainstream media is concerned. In a laconic press release published less than 24 hours after the plane’s Flight Data Recorder was reportedly found by a female gendarme, France’s air safety investigative authority, the BEA, announced that a preliminary reading of its contents confirmed that the flight’s co-pilot intentionally brought about the plane’s fatal decent. The hypothesis that the plane was intentionally crashed by its allegedly suicidal co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had first been floated by French prosecutor Brice Robin just two days after the crash. It has dominated the headlines ever since, quickly taking on the aura of established fact.

Numerous aviation experts and professional associations have condemned this rush to judgment and the role of French authorities in fueling it. They include, most recently, the International Federation of Airline Pilots’ Associations (IFALPA), which, in a statement, describes the scenario depicted by the French prosecutor as “beyond our comprehension” and pointedly notes that the conduct of the Germanwings investigation does not meet internationally accepted standards. The IFALPA statement calls attention, in particular, to the damage done to the integrity of the investigation by “leaks of protected information, media pressure, and political considerations.”

What the aviation experts and professional associations undoubtedly know, but the broader public in general does not, is that a known malfunction in a cockpit computer on the A320 family of planes could initiate a controlled descent like that Lubitz is accused of having intentionally brought about and, furthermore, that so long as the computer is running, the pilot or pilots would not be able to override it.

Including Germanwings 9525, no less than three planes of the same type have either crashed or narrowly escaped doing so in the just the last four months. According to published reports, both of the others suffered a computer malfunction.

Thus, on November 5, a Lufthansa Airbus 321 en route from Bilbao to Munich went into a descent shortly before reaching cruising altitude. The A321 is a longer version of the A320. The BFU, Germany’s air safety investigative authority, has established that the descent was automatically programmed by the plane’s Flight Augmentation Computers (FAC), a component of Airbus’s so-called Fly-by-Wire system. Ironically, the Flight Augmentation Computers are supposed to provide protection against pilot errors. In the case of Lufthansa flight 1829, however, the computer system was itself erring due to faulty data from frozen sensors on the exterior of the plane. After an initial loss in altitude of some 4000 feet in about a minute, the crew battled for nearly three quarters of an hour to keep the plane afloat, pulling constantly on the joystick to counteract the programmed descent.

According to the BFU’s preliminary report on the incident, after consultation with technical staff on the ground, the pilots were able finally to regain control of the plane by shutting down one of the data units reporting faulty information. This in turn caused the computer to disengage. (A recent article in the German weekly Der Spiegel tells a still more dramatic, but apparently erroneous, story. According to Der Spiegel, the captain of the aircraft had finally to resort to flipping circuit-breakers in order to cut off electricity to the computer system.)

On December 28, just six weeks after the Lufthansa 1829 incident, an Asia Airlines Airbus 320 en route from Surabaya to Singapore suddenly went into a sharp climb, then stalled and crashed into the Java Sea. Indonesian authorities have refused to issue a preliminary report. But here too a malfunction of the Flight Augmentation Computers appears to have played a role. Citing sources with knowledge of the investigation, Bloomberg has reported that in the case of Air Asia flight 8501, the captain of the aircraft did indeed pull a circuit breaker cutting off power to the Flight Augmentation Computers shortly before the crash. It appears to have been this unplugging of the computer system – perhaps combined with manual inputs from the co-pilot? – that provoked the plane to climb too abruptly and stall.

Given the recent precedents of Air Asia 8501 and Lufthansa 1829, it is hardly surprising that many pilots and aviation experts immediately assumed that Germanwings Flight 9525 had suffered a computer malfunction due to frozen sensors. (See, for instance, the comments to an Aviation Herald synopsis of the BFU report on Lufthansa 1829 here. As chance would have it, the synopsis was posted on March 24, shortly before the ill-fated Germanwings flight departed from Bilbao.)

Now, however, the analysis of the 2nd “black box” by the BEA appears to have confirmed that the French prosecutor’s “suicide” hypothesis is correct, after all. But the problem is that when the prosecutor first affirmed that Lubitz manually reset the target altitude of the aircraft, i.e. to assure its destruction, he appears to have had no way of knowing this. It should be noted that the prosecutor made this affirmation likewise on the basis of information provided to him by the BEA. At the time, the BEA is known to have had at its disposal only the first “black box” or Voice Cockpit Recorder, not the Flight Data Recorder containing the technical details of the flight’s operation.

Per the prosecutor’s account and leaks to the media, the BEA’s investigators are supposed to have “heard” that Lubitz reset the target altitude. But Gérard Arnoux, a recently retired Air France pilot who flew A320s for eighteen years, has noted that the control in question makes “no noise whatsoever.” Indeed, during an appearance on the French current affairs program Le Grand Journal, Arnoux pointed to several anomalies in the prosecutor’s account.

Thus, as proof that Lubitz was alive and conscious during the plane’s descent, the prosecutor has claimed that Lubitz’s “normal breathing” is audible on the recording. (It can be noted in passing that this would not in fact prove that Lubitz was conscious and, under the circumstances, might even be taken as proof to the contrary.) Given the high-level of ambient cockpit noise, however, Arnoux insisted that it would be impossible to hear breathing on the recording.

Finally, Arnoux has noted that if in fact the pilot was locked out of the cockpit, as the prosecutor has suggested, he ought to have been able to gain entry by using an emergency code – unless, that is, the co-pilot intentionally chose to deny entry by using a switch on the control panel. Even in the latter case, however, the emergency code ought to have set off an alarm in the cockpit. But the reconstruction of the last minutes of the flight, as ostensibly based on the cockpit recording, makes no mention of any such alarm.

Arnoux is the president of the Surveillance Committee on Air Safety, a French citizen’s group formed by the families of victims of plane crashes. In the aftermath of the Germanwings crash, he immediately called attention to the possibility of computer-error, citing the recent episodes of pilots’ losing control of Airbuses. He likewise pointedly told the French daily Le Figaro that, contrary to what was said in the media, there were in fact storm clouds reported in the path of the Germanwings flight and these could have caused sensors to freeze.

Apart from the specific anomalies in the BEA’s account of the Germanwings crash, Arnoux has also pointed to a more general structural problem with the BEA itself: namely, the fact that, contrary to international norms, it is not an independent agency, but rather directly subordinate to the French government. In the case of an Airbus, this dependence upon the French government creates a glaring conflict of interest. France is one of the two major shareholders in the Airbus Group, holding some 12% of the company’s stock. The other major shareholder is, incidentally, Germany, which likewise holds 12%.

Arnoux’s comments on Le Grand Journal have provoked controversy in France and the accusation that he was fueling “conspiracy theories.” In response to queries from the weekly L’Express, he appeared to relativize the import of the remarks, now endorsing the prosecutor’s thesis and dismissing the anomalies as merely a problem of “communication.” The article in L’Express, which is ostensibly dedicated to debunking these “conspiracy theories,” refers only to such theories as are so absurd as not to require debunking – like that the flight was shot down by experimental American weaponry. Revealingly, it makes no mention of the more banal possibility that Arnoux and other aviation experts invoked in the immediate aftermath of the crash: namely, that of computer error.

Contacted by the author, Arnoux reiterated his concerns about the lack of independence of the BEA investigation, noting that Airbus is the “sole engine of France’s balance of trade” and hence “untouchable.” Nonetheless, he insisted that he now believes that the theory of pilot suicide provides the best available explanation for the crash. Any other explanation, Arnoux said, would require a highly improbable conjunction of events: firstly, that the plane began its descent on its own (which, as Arnoux acknowledges, is possible); secondly, that Lubitz lost consciousness in the cockpit; and, thirdly, that the system permitting entry to the cockpit malfunctioned. It should be recalled, however, that Arnoux’s own earlier observations call into question whether the captain of the aircraft ever in fact entered the emergency code that could have opened the cockpit door from the outside.

Arnoux’s colleague, Henri Marnet-Cornus, has a more radical view of the BEA’s failings. Himself a former airlines pilot, Marnet-Cornus is the co-author with Gérard Arnoux of a widely-cited report on Air France flight 447, an Airbus 330 that crashed into the Atlantic en route from Rio to Paris in 2009. “How can one trust an agency that tells us in a press conference on March 25 that the analysis of the Cockpit Voice Recorder will take a long time (days or even weeks) and then, the following night, breaks the rules by making a transcript of the recording available to the media,” Marnet-Cornus told the author, “that says that on the recording one hears the noise of a control that does not make any noise?” “I don’t believe what the BEA says anymore,” Marnet-Cornus concluded, “Anything is possible.”

Tom Cruise - Mission: Impossible 5 Stunt 'The Most Dangerous Thing I've Ever Done' (Exclusive) - Yahoo Movies UK,"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdWsueWFob28uY29tL21vdmllcy90b20tY3J1aXNlLW1pc3Npb24taW1wb3NzaWJsZS01LXBsYW5lLXNjZW5lLTExNDQwODk2MTU2Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tom Cruise told Yahoo Movies that a sequence in the upcoming ‘Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation’ is “undoubtedly the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done”.

- Mission: Impossible 5 First Teaser Trailer

- Cruise Brings Trafalgar Square To A Standstill



The scene in question, which can be seen at the end of the brand new trailer, sees his character Ethan Hunt strapped to the side of an Airbus A400M plane as it takes off… and Cruise was doing it for real.

Watch the trailer below:

We spoke to the 52-year-old star, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, in depth about the mind-blowing stunt.

How did the stunt come about?

Tom Cruise: “I knew I wanted to have an airplane sequence. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. As a kid I remember flying on an airplane and thinking: ‘what would it be like out on the wing or on the side of the airplane?!’”

Christopher McQuarrie: “We knew we needed a stunt. The bar had been raised to such a point [with the Burj Khalifa scene in ‘Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol’, see below] that the expectations was so high. We kept looking for a location. Unfortunately when you’ve climbed the tallest building in the world you cant have an action sequence on the second tallest building in the world! So any skyscraper was out.

“So we came up with two incredibly physically punishing things for Tom to do and we ended up using both in the film. The first is the Airbus A400M scene, the second has only been fleetingly alluded to in the trailer.

“While searching for different locations, the production designer James Bissell bought me a model of this Airbus airplane and presented it as something we could use in the movie. I suggested to Tom ‘what if you were on the outside of this thing when it took off’. I meant it as sort of a half joke, but he said back to me: ‘yeah I could do that!’”

How did they do it?

Tom Cruise: “The things we had to figure out were: the engineering of putting a camera outside the airplane; figuring out where I could go outside the airplane and the images that we had in mind for it.

Story continues

“Then it was physically getting the shot because we wanted to climb at a steep angle so you could see the ground rush away from below me. And that’s a very big airplane. So we met with the test pilot and the guys who created the A400m Airbus and we just talked the numbers on how it could be done.

“Then we had to design the rig [for the camera] – because anytime you’re using that kind of power from the engines with that speed you want to make sure the camera doesn’t break off and hit me!”



Check out the camera below.

What were the dangers?

Tom Cruise: “The things we we’re all very concerned about were particles on the runway and bird strikes. We spent days clearing out the nearby grass of any birds, and they brushed the runway as best they could. My stunt coordinator would poke me if he got reports of bird strikes. The pilot had to be on the look out for anything in the air that could impact me in any way.

“I also was testing how to keep my eyes open so you have a shot – I can’t have my eyes closed the entire time. The thing that no one else was thinking about, but I was, was the fuel. You have jet fuel coming right out of the back at me because I’m on the wing above the engine. Even when we were taxying I was also inhaling the fumes and they were going in my eyes.

“So we came up with this idea of a lens that covered my entire eyeball. So that when I opened my eyes my pupils and retina had protection from any particles and hard air from the runway.

“I remember one time we were going down the runway and there was just a little particle that just hit me, it was smaller than a finger nail. I was thankful it didn’t hit my hands or face, if it did I’d have a problem because those parts were exposed, but it still could have broken my ribs!

“Also there was the temperature because we’re in England, because it gets colder every thousand feet. It was so cold, especially because I wanted to wear a suit on the side of the plane!”

Christopher McQuarrie: “As dangerous as the Burj Khalifa was [in M:I 4] - and it was incredibly dangerous - the Burj Khalifa was static. And here you’re moving at such high speeds.

“If a bird hit him at that sort of a speed, that would have been it. That was the one variable that we were constantly aware of.

“But the flying wasn’t nearly as bad as the taxiing on the runway because of the exhaust fumes he was inhaling. You cannot understand how physically punishing that stunt was.

“I read about a guy in the ‘70s who did something similar, whose name was something like “the human fly”, and it started raining and the rain was actually cutting his skin and they had to touch back down. Certainly nobody’s ever done it in a business suit!”

How did they complete the scene?

Tom Cruise: “Once I was on the side of the airplane that was it. We had a loading station where everyone got in and checked the cameras. Then they wire we me up for sound. Then I’m on. There’s no way to get me off the airplane half way through!

“I’m on the side of the plane from the moment the engine starts to the moment the engine shuts down. The climb, the taxi, down the runway, getting the shot, leveling off, turning around and landing. And I did it EIGHT TIMES to get the shot.”

Christopher McQuarrie: “I’ve never been more stressed my entire life than I was watching that plane take off and land. True to form the big note that Tom gave me before we took off was ‘Just remember if I look like I’m panicking, I’m acting! Do not cut unless I do this’ and he touched the top of his head. Sometimes it was difficult to distinguish one from the other. But the truth of the matter is he had a great time doing it.”

Tom Cruise: “I fly warbirds (vintage military aircrafts), I fly aerobatic airplanes, but this was pretty damn exciting and exhilarating. The adrenaline was flowing!

“When that thing was going down the runway it was everything to keep my feet down, then it went up and my body was slamming on the side. I was like whoa, this is intense.

“It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done to be honest. The Burj Khalifa scene [from Mission: impossible - Ghost Protocol] was incredibly dangerous, so was Moab [the climbing scene in ‘Mission: Impossible 2’].

“Motorcycle scenes are dangerous because I can’t wear pads and I don’t wear a helmet. I’m going at high speeds and anything can happen. But I’m in control on a motorcycle… I can put the breaks on.

“But outside the airplane there’s so many factors. Just too many things can happen. You don’t want to do it. Once we had it, it was ‘We’re not doing it anymore’!”

‘Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation’ co-stars Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. It is released in the UK on 31 July 2015.

In 2012, when Air France Flight 447 crashed, it was thought that the design of the Airbus A330-200 cockpit was to blame. So aircraft manufacturers spend years creating the safest and most effective control panels for their planes.

However, one plucky designer, Raphael Andre, decided to buck the trend after being inspired by a trip to Danish home store giant, Ikea, in Toulouse, France.

The flat-pack cockpit kit developed by Airbus inspired by the ready-to-assemble furniture of IKEA

Andre, a researcher at aircraft manufacture, was so taken by the simplicity of ready-to-assemble furniture he suggested applying the same principle to a cockpit.

'After a trip to look at some furniture (at Ikea), it occurred to me that a simple-to-construct, wooden version of a cockpit would do the job very well,' he explained.

Two years after his initial light-bulb moment, Andre visited the Airbus ProtoSpace in Toulous, where innovation and prototyping are encouraged, and after doing some basic drawings, he created a cockpit prototype which didn't require any tools, as the parts just slotted together.

Companies like Boeing and Airbus take years to create the safest and most effective aircraft control panels

Andre created a cockpit prototype which didn't require any tools, as the parts just slotted together

Then together with a colleague, Laurent Saint-Marc, he constructed a small cardboard version of the cockpit mock-up at an Airbus fabrication laboratory, followed by a full-sized wooden prototype.

The prototype was taken on board by Airbus, and was ready to use in a few days.

And Airbus states on its website that Ikea-inspired prototyping is also being used by Continental - who make dashboard interiors.

Meanwhile Hong Kong's Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a unique ‘double-decker’ armrest

It's not the only area of aviation design set to be revolutionised by simplistic design. Hong Kong's Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a unique ‘double-decker’ armrest on long-haul economy seats designed by James Lee.

The armrest was inspired by the simplicity of a paperclip and would allow two passengers to use the armrest, one one the upper deck and one below.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997718930244446}",neutral,0.9997718930244446,0

Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD), the aerospace manufacturing division of the Korean Air Group, has been selected by Airbus to supply new Sharklet wingtip devices including a wingspan extension for the A330neo – the new variant of the best-selling A330 Family of widebody aircraft.

Under the terms of the agreement, KAL-ASD will manufacture the new composite wingtip devices at its Busan facility in South Korea, and supply them to the A330 Family final assembly line in Toulouse. Inspired by the curved wingtips on the A350 XWB, the A330neo’s devices will increase overall wingspan from 60.3m of today’s A330ceo to 64m while conferring increased lift with reduced drag.

Along with the A330neo’s latest generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, these new wingtips plus other aerodynamic enhancements and new cabin features will enable the aircraft to achieve an overall 14% reduction in fuel burn per seat compared with A330ceos in service today. The application of these incremental innovations will not only make the A330neo the most cost-efficient widebody in its size category, but will also allow operators to benefit from a range increase of up to 400 nautical miles while giving operators all the operational commonality advantages of the Airbus Family. Deliveries of the A330neo will start in Q4 2017.

KAL-ASD is a long-term industrial partner of Airbus, with a relationship dating back more than 25 years. Today KAL-ASD manufactures and supplies parts for various Airbus programmes including the Sharklets for the best-selling A320 Family, fuselage skin panels and floor assemblies for the A330 Family and the composite cargo doors for the A350 XWB.

The A330 Family, which has now attracted more than 1,500 orders, is serving over 100 operators worldwide who continue to benefit from numerous on-going product enhancements. This family is part of the world’s most modern and comprehensive widebody product line, which also includes the larger A350 XWB and double deck A380. Together, the various family members and type variants efficiently cover all airline widebody requirements for regional, medium and long-haul operations, seating from 250 to over 500 passengers and sharing unique levels of operational commonality.

Finnair will deploy its first Airbus A350 initially on short-haul routes – much like any airline that wishes to boost its crews knowledge and flight hours aboard an aircraft. It will then begin to deploy its A350 on longer routes.

In the first instance, the Airbus A350 will operate from Helsinki across the Finnair short-haul network from the 5th October, with the destinations such as Rovaniemi, Oulu, London Heathrow, Frankfurt-am-Main, Stockholm Arlanda, Paris Charls De Gualle, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Oslo, Barcelona, Malaga Berlin-TXL, Gothenburg, Düsseldorf, Vienna, Munich and Brussels.

A full list and dates is at http://www.finnair.com/A350

Long haul services will target the Far East with destinations such as Shanghai, Beijing, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Singapore, based on the following flight pairs and dates:

AY57/AY58 Helsinki to Shanghai commences 25th October 2015

AY51/AY52 Helsinki to Beijing Capital commences 21st November 2015

AY89/AY90 Helsinki to Bangkok commences 4th December 2015

AY69/AY70 Helsinki to Hong Kong commences 1st February 2016

AY81/AY82 Helsinki to Singapore commences 5th May 2016

The full list and dates is at http://www.finnair.com/A350

Again, changes may/will occur dependant on deliveries of A350 aircraft, and maybe substituted with A330 aircraft.

Finnair will be operating the plane in a two class configuration based on:

46 Business Class seats in a 1-2-1 formation

Airbus supports PM's 'Make in India' initiative - Business Today,"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vbGF0ZXN0L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtcmVhZHktZm9yLWRvbWVzdGljLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctb24tbWFrZS1pbi1pbmRpYS01MDc1NC0yMDE1LTA0LTEx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus on Saturday said it was ready to manufacture in India, expressing support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' initiative during his visit to the aircraft manufacturer's facility in Toulouse, France.

Modi took the tour of the facility where planes are manufactured. He was given a briefing by officials on the functioning.

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders, who received Modi, said, ""We are honoured to host Prime Minister Modi in Toulouse and convey to him our desire to forge a stronger industrial bond with India. India already takes a centre-stage role in our international activities and we want to even increase its contribution to our products.""

""We support Prime Minister Modi's 'Make in India' call and (we) are ready to manufacture in India, for India and the world,"" Enders added.

External affairs ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted, ""500% increase in 5 years. @Airbus to PMA @narendramodi : Indian outsourcing to increase from $400 mil to $2 billion.""

""Make in India gains further momentum. $2 billion cumulative outsourcing planned by @Airbus from India by 2020,"" Akbaruddin posted on Twitter.

In India, Airbus Group already operates two engineering centres - one focused on civil aviation and the other one defence - besides, a research and technology (R&T) centre which together employ over 400 highly qualified people.

The group's senior representative conveyed their decision to expand these centres so that they can take on comprehensive design responsibilities for future Airbus group programmes.

The Prime Minister was given a tour of the Airbus A380 final assembly line. Currently, four A380 flights serve India daily.

""Much larger markets are waiting to be tapped, the potential for A380 to help Indian carriers win greater multinational market share with a flagship aircraft is enormous,"" an Airbus press release said.

The aircraft manufacturer is willing to set up final assembly lines and establish supply chains and related infrastructure for military transport aircraft and helicopters in India, the press release said.

These would be in full compliance with the procurement policies specified by the Ministry of Defence and local FDI (foreign direct investment) guidelines, the release said.

Airbus Defence and Space has submitted a joint proposal with Tata to produce the modern C-295 aircraft in the country as a replacement for the ageing Avro aircraft of the Indian Air Force.

The division also plans to develop and manufacture electronic sensors with a partner in the country and has advanced discussions to support Hindustan Aeronautics' (HAL) combat aircraft programme, the release said.

Airbus Helicopters is in discussions with domestic companies to finalise teaming arrangements of various helicopter programmes, including naval utility helicopters, reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters as well as naval multi-role helicopters.

Modi also visited the French CNES space agency's facility where a group of Indian students greeted him and posed for photographs and took selfies.

Plane cabins on Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo to squeeze in more seats - Sydney Morning Herald,"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L3RyYXZlbGxlci90cmF2ZWwtbmV3cy9wbGFuZS1jYWJpbnMtb24tYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwbmVvLXRvLXNxdWVlemUtaW4tbW9yZS1zZWF0cy0yMDE1MDQyMS0xbXB6dHouaHRtbNIBjAFodHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L3RyYXZlbGxlci90cmF2ZWwtbmV3cy9wbGFuZS1jYWJpbnMtb24tYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwbmVvLXRvLXNxdWVlemUtaW4tbW9yZS1zZWF0cy0yMDE1MDQyMS0xbXB6dHouaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Seat pitch"" - the space between your seat and the same point on the chair in front - may well also be affected. On Ryanair aircraft now in operation - the carrier's 300-strong fleet largely comprises the 189-seat Boeing 737-800 aircraft - this is 30in (76.2cm). The airline has said it does not want to drop below this, but the Boeing 737 MAX 200 may cut the gap to 29in (73.6cm). The A320neo could go as low as 27in (68.6cm). This latter statistic will help Airbus overcome the fact that while the A320neo will feature five fewer seats than the Boeing 737 MAX 200, it is a marginally shorter aircraft. The expanded capacity on the standard Boeing 737 MAX means that the design includes an extra exit door to assist passenger movement - and an extra two on the Ryanair model. Although this ""pack-them-in"" strategy will result in more attractive balance sheets for airlines, the profits will come at the expense of economy-class passengers. Michael O'Leary has also revealed that the Ryanair incarnation of the Boeing 737 MAX will use ""slim"" seating, although frequent customers of the airline may suggest that the carrier's facilities already qualify for this flattering description. The Boeing 737 MAX can fit in enough seats to hit Ryanair's 'sweet spot' according to boss Michael O'Leary. A survey by Business Traveller in 2012 listed Ryanair's seats as the tightest offered by 32 major airlines - at 16in (40.6cm). The same figures showed that British Airways economy seats could be as wide as 18in (45.7cm), with those on Virgin Atlantic stretching to 19in (48.3). Seat width on Ryanair's key low-cost rival easyJet was listed at 171/2in (44.5cm). Of course, airlines could argue that cramped seating conditions are not entirely their fault - and that passengers are as much to blame. A 2012 report by CNN revealed that while the average width of the American posterior in the sixties was 14in (35.6cm), in the second decade of the 21st century it has crept up to a more generous 15in (38.1cm).

The Boeing 737 MAX 200 is, however, unlikely to play host to an unusual item that is floating around drawing boards at Boeing's headquarters. The firm has filed a patent for what is described as a ""Transport Vehicle Upright Sleep Support System"" - a device to help economy-class passengers doze off while seated. Effectively a pillow with a hole for breathing, it can be strapped to the headrest of your chair, cradling your face and chest as you lean forward in a bid to enjoy some rest. It will be no match for the flat beds that give first and business-class passengers a full night's slumber, but it may be an answer to the issue of sleeplessness in less luxurious parts of the aircraft. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary. Credit: Reuters However, the device would be most useful on long-haul flights. While Ryanair says it will begin services from Europe to the United States in the next decade, the Boeing 737 MAX 200 will not have the range to cross the Atlantic. There is more to the respective developments of the A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX 200 than a simple attempt to create modern aircraft in a competitive market. The race is part of the wider - and frequently bitter - rivalry between Seattle-based Boeing and Toulouse-based Airbus. Airbus has been vocal about its opposite number's work, saying that the two extra doors on the Boeing 737 MAX 200 will increase the weight of the aircraft and, therefore, reduce its fuel efficiency, while also suggesting that the rush to squeeze in more passengers will mean a noticeable reduction in the quality of in-flight service, with three of the standard eight galley trolleys used to offer food, drink and duty-free sales needing to be removed from the aircraft to accommodate the added seating.

""Even low-cost carriers need more [trolleys] than that if they are serious about on-board sales and ancillary revenues,"" Airbus spokesman Mary Anne Greczyn said. Boeing has contented itself with defending its product. ""The 737 MAX 200 is the perfect fit for Ryanair,"" said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, at September's launch. ""It will provide improved efficiencies, 20 per cent lower emissions, increased revenues and a high level of passenger comfort."" Whatever the ramifications for the paying clientele in the average economy-class cabin, passengers are unlikely to be able to avoid this new generation of aircraft. Airbus received more than 2000 orders for the A320neo in the two years following its launch in December 2010, with Qatar Airways putting in a request for 50 of the aircraft in November 2011. Boeing had more than 2500 orders for the 737 MAX by the end of 2014.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997559189796448}",neutral,0.9997559189796448,0
