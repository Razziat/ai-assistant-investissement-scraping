Airbus and Georgia Tech Open Center for Overall Aircraft Design | News Center - Georgia Tech News Center,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmdhdGVjaC5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDE4LzExLzAxL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtZ2VvcmdpYS10ZWNoLW9wZW4tY2VudGVyLW92ZXJhbGwtYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVzaWdu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Officials from Airbus and the Georgia Institute of Technology met to celebrate opening of the new Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)-enabled Overall Aircraft Design (OAD) center.

Airbus and Georgia Institute of Technology have officially opened the Airbus / Georgia Tech Center for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)-enabled Overall Aircraft Design (OAD).

This center will contribute to the development and demonstration of a concurrent overall aircraft design process – taking full advantage of MBSE, interactive, parametric design space exploration and digital enablers with a team of 30 Georgia Tech researchers, doctoral students and Airbus experts.

The opening ceremony was attended by Marc Fischer, Senior Vice President Flight Physics at Airbus; Amanda Simpson, Vice President of Research and Technology for Airbus Americas; and Mark Costello, chair of Georgia Tech’s Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.

“We are proud to take the partnership with Georgia Tech to the next level,” said Fischer. “Our future aircraft developments will benefit from much more integrated and interdisciplinary processes. Model Based Systems Engineering is at the foundation of this ambition and allows us to cover not just the conventional OAD disciplines, but also trade opportunities between engineering and manufacturing. This partnership aims to build a much larger ecosystem within and beyond Airbus, bringing our European and international partners on board.”

""This collaboration between Airbus and our Aerospace Systems Design Lab provides a unique opportunity for our students and faculty to work on research projects that are defining the next generation aircraft,” Costello said. “Model-based Systems Engineering is a specific strength of the Aerospace Engineering School, and this collaboration with Airbus will enable us to help develop the next generation of aircraft design thinking.""

The collaboration has moved from a framing and ideation phase into project mode - delivering along a multi-year roadmap. Beyond contractual research work in the traditional sense, Airbus and Georgia Tech have engaged in a truly collaborative effort, where industrial experience and state-of-the-art research are combined.

“This Center is further demonstration of the value our American education institutions contribute to our entire global enterprise,” said Simpson.

Airbus and Audi demonstrate mini-me version of flying car at Amsterdam show - GeekWire,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE4L2FpcmJ1cy1hdWRpLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlLW1pbmktdmVyc2lvbi1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWFtc3RlcmRhbS1zaG93L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A flying car developed by Airbus, Audi and Italdesign took a high-profile test flight today at the Amsterdam Drone Week conference, but its size was low-profile.

The modular vehicle was a quarter-scale demonstration model of the “Pop.Up Next” transportation system that the three companies are developing.

The idea is to have a passenger compartment that can sit on top of a four-wheeled electric vehicle to travel the roads, or attach to the bottom of a quadcopter to fly through the air. At the Amsterdam show, the three companies displayed impressive full-scale mockups of the flying car, but the gizmo that actually flew was basically a drone with brackets attached.

When the drone landed onstage, a toy car drove up beneath it, and the car’s chassis was pulled up to the drone’s underside. Then the drone flew off, leaving the car’s four-wheeled base behind. During the final part of the demonstration, the drone set down again, waited for the wheeled vehicle platform to drive beneath and deposited the chassis on top.

You can see how it worked in this video:

Audi and its subsidiary, Italdesign, took the wraps off its partnership with Airbus earlier this year, but this week’s Amsterdam show served as a coming-out party for the small-scale prototype.

“Flying taxis are on the way. We at Audi are convinced of that,” Bernd Martens, who is an Audi board member and Italdesign’s president, said in a news release. “More and more people are moving to cities. And more and more people will be mobile thanks to automation.”

Audi is already conducting tests of on-demand air taxi services in Mexico City and São Paulo in cooperation with Voom, an Airbus subsidiary. Customers can book helicopter flights through Voom, and get a ride to or from the airport in an Audi.

Airbus and Audi are also gearing up for a flying-taxi test project in the German city of Ingolstadt, Audi’s corporate headquarters.

“Services like this help us to understand our customers’ needs better,” Martens said. “Because in the future, flying taxis will appeal to a wide range of city dwellers. With Pop.Up Next we are simultaneously exploring the boundaries of what is technically possible. The next step is for a full-size prototype to fly and drive.”

It’s not clear just how quickly Pop.Up Next will turn into a widely available commercial service. Audi says it could happen “as soon as the coming decade.”

Meanwhile, other flying-car efforts are gathering steam: Uber says it will begin pilot projects in Dallas-Fort Worth, Dubai and Los Angeles by as early as 2020. Boeing is involved in several ventures targeting the air-mobility market, including Aurora Flight Sciences (a Boeing subsidiary that’s working with Uber) and SkyGrid (a platform partnership with SparkCognition).

Other companies working on electric-powered, vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles, also known as eVTOL aircraft, include Opener, Kitty Hawk, Joby Aviation, Terrafugia, VerdeGo Aero, Britain’s Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce, the Dutch venture PAL-V, China’s EHang, Germany’s Volocopter and Lilium, Switzerland’s Passenger Drone, Slovakia’s AeroMobil and Japan’s Cartivator Project.

Pop.Up Next isn’t Airbus’ only foray into flying cars: Airbus Ventures is supporting the development of Vahana’s electric-powered air vehicles, which went into flight testing early this year in eastern Oregon.

All this activity is what led Jaiwon Shin, NASA’s associate administrator for aeronautics, to say during a Seattle conference this month that there’s a “revolution coming in aviation.” Over the next few years, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration are planning a series of Urban Air Mobility Grand Challenges to lay the groundwork for what they hope will be a peaceful revolution.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987549781799316}",neutral,0.9987549781799316,0
Airbus A330 delivery brings dedicated tanker capability to South Korean Air Force - Defense News,"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxOC8xMS8xMy9haXJidXMtYTMzMC1kZWxpdmVyeS1icmluZ3MtZGVkaWNhdGVkLXRhbmtlci1jYXBhYmlsaXR5LXRvLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhbi1haXItZm9yY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia ― The first Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport for the Republic of Korea Air Force has landed in South Korea for its acceptance tests.

According to a news release from the manufacturer, the aircraft, which was piloted by a joint Airbus and Air Force crew, arrived at Gimhae Air Base in Busan after a ferry flight from the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Getafe, Spain, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada.

It will now undergo ground and flight tests in Gimhae. The Air Force will be supported by a team from Airbus, which will be based in South Korea for the duration of the tests and until the aircraft is officially handed over to the customer.

Airbus did not specify how long the acceptance tests will last, and referred questions about the specifics of the test program to the Air Force.

This aircraft is the first of four ordered by South Korea. Its arrival marks the second regional customer of the A330 MRTT to receive its first aircraft this year, with the first of Singapore’s six aircraft having been delivered in August.

Another customer, France, had also taken delivery of its first MRTT in October.

RELATED

The A330 MRTT marks the introduction of a dedicated tanker capability for South Korea’s Air Force, and it will allow the service’s fighters to increase their persistence during missions.

The service is currently operating the Boeing F-15K Slam Eagle and the Lockheed Martin KF-16C/D Fighting Falcon as its primary combat aircraft. South Korea has also ordered the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, with the first one for the Air Force rolling out earlier this year.

South Korea selected the A330 MRTT for its $1.26 billion KC-X program in 2015 after evaluating competing proposals from Boeing, with the KC-46 Pegasus, and Israel Aerospace Industries, who proposed converting 767 airliners in a tanker aircraft.

Airbus A380: Facts about the world's largest passenger jet - USA TODAY,"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvY29sdW1uaXN0L2NveC8yMDE4LzExLzE4L2FpcmJ1cy0zODAvMjAxODMwNjAwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Captain: Reader questions about the Airbus A380

Question: How high above the ground does the pilot of an A380 sit?

– submitted by reader Charles Dzogbenuku, Accra, Ghana

Answer: The eye height for an Airbus A380 pilot is 7.2 meters (23.6 feet). It is lower than the Boeing 747, which is 8.7 meters (28.5 feet).

Q: How easy is it to land the largest jumbo jets?

– Azlan Allam

A: A pilot with significant experience can transition to a very large airplane quickly. There is little difference in the handling characteristics, but the flight deck height and wingspan require practice.

The 747 and A380 pilots I know characterize both as easy airplanes to fly.

Q: How much fuel does a jetliner hold in gallons?

– Richard, Sebring, Florida

A: The A380, the largest airplane in commercial airline service, can hold nearly 86,000 U.S. gallons of jet fuel. Other airplanes hold much less, such as the A321 that holds up to 7,800 U.S. gallons.

Q: Why do the most modern A320s have the tall, upswept winglets (sharklets) rather than the smaller wing fences at their wingtips that the older models had? Has Airbus discovered that the new winglets are more effective than their older wing fences? If so, why does the A380 have similar style of wing fences as the older A320s?

– Jennifer von Geldern, Yuba City, California

A: The large winglets (sharklets) are more fuel-efficient than the earlier smaller fences. The A380 aerodynamic engineers found that the fences are efficient enough. Each wing is different.

Q: In the last few years, I've flown a couple of long haul flights on the A380 (Air France) and A330 (Iberia). Neither of them had A/C vents at the seats. Needless to say, both flights got quite warm. I assume this is for cost reasons?

– Bret, Morgan Hill, California

A: When an airline orders a new airplane they can specify if they do not want air vents. It is a cost savings, however most airplanes are delivered with passenger air vents. I am surprised to hear that an A380 was ordered without them.

Airbus A220 Airliner: Delta unveils single-aisle jetliner for US flyers - CNN,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAtYWlybGluZXItZGVsdGEtdXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlanta, Georgia CNN —

For some folks, flying on a brand new airliner is almost as exciting as riding in a spanking new car.

So get ready air travel fans: Beginning in January, travelers in the USA will get to fly on the first newly designed large single-aisle airliner in nearly three decades.

Delta Air Lines, the world’s second largest carrier, unveiled its new Airbus A220-100 during a ceremony Monday at its headquarters at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

With the roar of jet engines in the background, excited employees lined up to tour Ship 8101, as Delta named it, the first of 75 A220s that Delta is expected to bring into its fleet over the next two to three years.

SWISS, Korean Air and airBaltic already fly these jets, but Delta will be the first carrier in the US. Taking the stage at the celebration, Delta CEO Ed Bastian welcomed the A220 as “a beautiful new member of the family.”

This $81-million jet has racked up several firsts:

– It’s the first Airbus airliner designed and built by another company — Canada’s Bombardier.

– It’s the first single-aisle airliner to have super-strong, lightweight, non-metal wings made with a special process called resin transfer injection – squirting carbon fiber resin inside the wing skin. (This matters because carbon fiber wings have fewer rivets than metal wings. They slip through the air more smoothly, and they need less maintenance.)

– It’s the first single-aisle commercial airliner with electric brakes instead of typical hydraulic brakes. (No more leaky hydraulic brake lines equals less maintenance.)

Delta plans to use the A220 as part of a fleet modernization program. Some airplanes on Delta’s domestic routes are more than three decades old, with retro-fitted passenger seat power ports and no in-flight entertainment systems.

“The simple idea is to provide customers what it is they tell us they want,” said Delta Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Tim Mapes. “That means space, innovative technology and comfort. All of those things are evident in this plane.”

The A220s, along with about 100 other new jets, will replace 20% of older, less-efficient aircraft by 2020, according to Delta. The airline also plans to replace 25% of its domestic fleet over the next three years, Bastian said, “taking delivery of more airplanes than at any time in our history.”

One reason behind this move is a massive projected increase in passengers.

Last year, worldwide air passenger traffic crossed 4 billion for the first time, up 7.3% from 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association. By 2036, that number is expected to nearly double.

In the US, about 965 million passengers flew commercial airlines last year, an increase of more than 3%, according to the Department of Transportation. By 2036, the industry predicts the number of passengers in the US will exceed a billion.

Airlines are looking to meet that need with the help of a new generation of jets designed to offer creature comforts travelers want while keeping profits strong. The Airbus A220-100 is one of those new jets.

Seats

Once you step aboard this plane, you immediately notice it just feels bigger than a typical single-aisle airliner. Nearly 7-foot-high ceilings and windows larger than many other kinds of jets.

The cabin is a spacious 10-feet, seven-inches wide.

Delta has designed its A220-100s to seat 109 passengers — including 12 in first class, 15 in premium economy and 82 in economy. Up front, first class seats are in a 2-2 configuration with head rests and other accoutrements, including water bottle holders and adjustable arm rests.

In Economy, travelers may like the seat width — measuring 18.6 inches — the widest main cabin seats in Delta’s fleet. If you’re wondering about leg room in coach, the seat pitch ranges from 30 to 32 inches. Delta’s Boeing 717s, which seat about the same number of passengers, have a seat pitch of 31 inches in economy.

Another reason the main cabin feels big is the 2-3 seat configuration.

That means fewer middle seats – which is great news if you hate that “trapped feeling” some folks get when they’re in a middle seat.

If you’re in a window seat, you’ve got a bit more shoulder room, thanks to cleverly designed indentations in the cabin walls. For the window shades, this plane went old school. No push-button electronic dimmers required. Just your typical pull-down window shades will do fine, thank you very much.

Delta’s A220 also offers full LED spectrum lighting, so crew members can change the color and brightness of the interior light based on various moods throughout the day.

In-flight entertainment

Main cabin seats will include seat-back screens for in-flight entertainment. In first class, the A220 offers the largest seatback in-flight entertainment screens in Delta’s fleet.

The jet’s Wi-FI uses a 2Ku satellite system, which Mapes said is the fastest in the fleet. It’s designed to provide around 70-100 megabits per second, he said, “which will allow anybody to do what they need.”

A deep library of TV and movies is available on any of the large seatback screens on each seat. Delta’s rival, American Airlines, has been moving away from seatback screens and instead requiring passengers to use their own devices to stream in-flight entertainment.

Restroom with a view

Traveling with small children is pretty common, so it’s nice to see airliner restrooms are getting more family friendly. The lavatories on this plane are large enough to change babies – and a pullout baby-changing table is available in the right rear restroom. They’re also large enough for a 6-foot-plus-tall person to stand up straight – which isn’t always the case on other jets.

There are three lavatories on this plane. Remarkably, one of them has something you don’t see very often in airliner restrooms: a window.

“The engineers saw an opportunity to put one in and we said ‘go for it,’” said Bastian.

It’s hard to know if the window will result in longer waits for the restroom, because passengers will be inside snapping photos.

Routes

The jet can fly nearly 3,400 miles, so Delta says it plans to use it for direct routes to cities that don’t usually fill larger planes.

If you have plans to fly from New York to Dallas-Ft. Worth or to Houston, Delta is hoping you’ll take notice. Those are two of the first routes the airline plans for these new jets beginning in January and April, respectively.

By the way, it’s no coincidence that those two cities are dominated by Delta’s competitors, United Airlines and American Airlines. Will the A220 allow Delta to give United and American a run for their money in these markets?

“Pretty good chance of it,” says Richard Aboulafia, aviation industry analyst at Teal Group.

The A220 also helps increase profits by saving fuel. Airbus says it’s 20% more fuel efficient than similar sized jets.

The A220’s weird history

But for many aviation enthusiasts, the weirdest thing about the A220 is the fact that for the first time in Airbus’s nearly half-century-long history, it’s selling a plane designed and built by another company.

How did that happen?

Basically, France-based Airbus stepped in last year and bought a controlling interest in the plane from a rival manufacturer – Canada’s Bombardier.

Before that, the plane – and its larger version – actually had different names – the CS100 and CS300. Airbus simply renamed them the A220-100 and A220-300.

“A truly shocking moment,” said Aboulafia. “You can’t write this stuff in a novel, no one would believe it.”

Experts say Bombardier was driven to make the deal because they feared the Trump administration’s trade policies with Canada would sink the company.

“Bombardier simply said, if we keep going with this program on our own, it’s doomed and it will drag us down with it,” Aboulafia said. “So by giving it to our arch rival, Airbus, then they can rescue it and at least we can build structures for it.”

“Airbus has spent the past ten years trying to kill this jet — and now it gets it for free,” he said.

More new jets

Of the four major US carriers, American Airlines boasts the youngest fleet. Its planes are an average of 10.5 years old, according to airfleets.net. Delta’s fleet is the oldest – averaging 16.3 years.

But that statistic will likely begin to change next year when Delta accepts delivery of new Airbus A330neos. These fuel-saving twin-engine widebodies will be used for medium haul trans-Atlantic routes and flights connecting Asia with the US West Coast.

Another jet – Boeing’s super-efficient 777-9X – is expected to make its first test flight next year. That plane — expected to be the world’s largest twin-engine jet — will have an all-metal body, but its wings will be made from light-weight, super strong carbon fiber composite material.

Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa and Emirates are among several international airlines that have ordered the 777-9X.

Also next year, Boeing is widely expected to announce its plans to build a new midsized airliner — which has already been unofficially nicknamed the 797.

It all means that your chances of flying on a newer plane are rising, as more air travelers take to the skies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999884843826294}",neutral,0.999884843826294,0
Delta Air Lines orders 10 additional Airbus A330-900s - Airbus,"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMS1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtb3JkZXJzLTEwLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtOTAwc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines has ordered 10 additional Airbus A330-900 widebody aircraft, expanding their A330neo order book from 25 to 35 aircraft. This latest order supports Delta’s international growth strategy in the near to medium term.

Simultaneously, Delta and Airbus have agreed to defer 10 previously ordered A350 XWBs to 2025-26 in order to accommodate the airline’s long-term growth strategy. Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects a further four in 2019-2020. Delta’s A330 fleet stands today at 42 widebody aircraft.

“The A330-900 is going to be an important addition to Delta’s fleet,” said Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian. “Airbus has infused this next generation of the successful A330 family with new technology and features providing advanced levels of comfort for our passengers and significant operating cost reductions that will make our airline stronger in the decades to come.”

“Operational efficiency and an exceptional passenger experience are core to Delta’s successful recipe, and it speaks volumes that they have chosen the A330-900,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “Delta has been endorsing the Airbus wide-body family from the outset by committing to both the A330 and the A350. We are listening to our customers and proud to be in the position to flexibly respond to their fleet requirements for more A330s and equally appreciate the ongoing commitment for more A350s as part of their long-term growth strategy.”

Scherer added: “This reconfirmed endorsement by one of the world’s largest and most respected airlines validates the economic credentials of our versatile Airbus widebody family in the most advanced and competitive environments.”

Building on the proven success of its popular twin-aisle, twin-engine, widebody A330 Family, Airbus launched the A330neo programme – comprising the A330-800 and A330-900 versions – in July 2014. The A330neo brings significant efficiency improvements while also introducing the Airspace by Airbus cabin, which offers the newest and most advanced in-flight experience with extra personal space and state-of-the-art ambient lighting.

Incorporating the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, along with aerodynamic enhancements – including new extended composite wingtips, which provide 3.7 metres of increased overall span – as well as increased lift and reduced drag, the A330neo is a more efficient aircraft which will generate savings through reduced fuel burn.

Twenty-four startups join Airbus accelerator programme - Airbus,"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMS10d2VudHktZm91ci1zdGFydHVwcy1qb2luLWFpcmJ1cy1hY2NlbGVyYXRvci1wcm9ncmFtbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 12 November 2018 – Airbus has selected twenty-four new startups to join its BizLab for the launch of the fourth accelerator programme, providing a platform to develop previously untapped technologies and ways of working in the aerospace sector.

Airbus BizLab is a global aerospace business accelerator where startups and Airbus intrapreneurs speed up the transformation of innovative ideas into valuable businesses. Since starting in 2015, Airbus BizLab has accelerated 50 startups and 40 internal projects, which have raised a combined € 19.5 million.

This year, Airbus BizLab also challenged startups to propose technical solutions contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals that Airbus is committed to.

With the opening earlier this year of Airbus BizLab’s fourth site in Madrid (Spain) - after Toulouse (France), Hamburg (Germany) and Bangalore (India) - the selected firms will join a unique consolidated global network within the four sites. During the six-month acceleration programme, the 24 startups will receive support from an international team of experts from various fields and have access to dedicated coaching staff, networking opportunities and co-working spaces. Hailing from ten countries around the world, the new startups were selected out of 495 applications from 64 countries. One of the main criteria used in the selection process were the synergies between the startup projects and Airbus’ innovation strategy.

Many fledgling aerospace businesses struggle today to turn innovative ideas and technologies into commercial reality, others face difficulties accessing customers or endure long certification processes. This significantly slows the pace of innovation. To overcome these hurdles, Airbus BizLab has developed a “hybrid” concept that helps startups better navigate the challenges of working with large firms.

Airbus BizLab already counts several success stories:

· Toulouse-based startup UWINLOC offers the world’s first connected battery-less indoor location solution designed for large volume tracking of assets in the manufacturing and logistics industries. UWINLOC raised € 4.5 Million in a Series A funding round led by ELAIA Partners to expand its operations in the United States and China.

· Neewee and EFLIGHT, both Bangalore BizLab alumni, signed contracts with Airbus. Neewee uses advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to improve manufacturing supply chain and procurement operations, while EFLIGHT has developed a solution that optimizes jet pilot response to flight conditions.

The 24 startups selected in the four BizLab campuses are as follows:

Toulouse campus:

AVE (France): Develops chimaera polymers by using molecular grafting technology.

Caddie Engineering (Bulgaria): New water-based air filtering technology for all biochemical and mechanical pollutants.

H24E (United Kingdom): Ultra-short pulse laser that splits water into hydrogen more efficiently than electrolysis.

Modularity Grid (United Kingdom): Digital platform that enables mini-grid operators to deliver affordable and reliable electricity in low income communities.

Reynolds (Russia): Advanced gas turbine generators for UAV and eVTOL markets.

Indiego (United States): Bridging the gap between human mobility constraints and existing transport infrastructure.

Hamburg campus:

Sensifai (Germany): Automatic video semantics recognition for large-scale

multimedia management.

The second of two A330neo models took the sky Tuesday morning in Toulouse and with it cleared Airbus’s flight test calendar that saw a complete revamp of its twin-engine aircraft portfolio over the last nine years. The first A330-800 wrapped its four-hour and four-minute maiden sortie, kicking off a comparatively brief flight test campaign that will lead to the jet’s certification and delivery to (newly-minted) launch operator Kuwait Airways in 2019.

It’s been an extraordinarily productive decade for Airbus. Since 2010, Airbus has launched and developed the incrementally-improved A320neo and A330neo families, completed flight test and certification of the all-new A350 (-900 and -1000), and acquired the A220 (-100 and -300) from Bombardier. Huge challenges remain as Airbus works to deliver its mountainous backlog and deliver a verdict on the future of the A380.

Airbus has nearly completed its development plans for the decade. No doubt there are concepts on the drawing board, but none yet have been given the full industrial go-ahead. The longer-range A321XLR waits for Boeing’s move on NMA, but Airbus’s 2020s are clear as it picks its priorities — and promotes new leaders — for the next decade. -J.O.

JetBlue has rolled out its latest specialty aircraft, an Airbus A320 painted in the colors of the Brooklyn Nets NBA pro basketball franchise.

JetBlue unveiled the jet, dubbed ‘BK Blue,” at a Thursday event at New York’s JFK Airport where the carrier announced it has renewed a partnership to remain the “Official Domestic Airline” of the Brooklyn Nets and the Barclays Center arena where the team plays. That pact has been extended for another five years.

“Straying from the airline’s traditional blue paint scheme, this all black and white aircraft includes the Brooklyn Nets logo on the tail, the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge and Barclays Center on the fuselage, and the phrase ‘Spread Love’ on the underbelly,” JetBlue says in a statement accompanying the unveiling.

JetBlue has rolled out a number of special aircraft “liveries” – or paint schemes – in recent years.

A number of those have been sports-related, including ones painted in the colors of the New York Jets pro football team, the Boston Celtics NBA team and the Boston Red Sox pro baseball franchise. Not coincidentally, New York JFK and Boston are JetBlue’s two busiest hubs.

Other special paint schemes for JetBlue during the past few years have included ones that pay homage to the New York City Fire and Police departments, the “binary code” computer language and one designed in an imaginary retro livery.

London/Toulouse, 19/11/2018 – Airbus has been selected by Eutelsat, one of the world’s leading satellites operators, to build two HOTBIRD new generation telecommunication satellites that will replace the current spacecraft and enhance capacity at Eutelsat’s premium broadcasting position 13° East.

The two satellites will deliver improved performances over the European and Middle-Eastern footprint, reinforced by a powerful European Superbeam.

They will ensure full service continuity over the operational 102 Ku-band transponders/frequencies, secure deployment and capacity redundancy at the HOTBIRD position. The HOTBIRD fleet forms one of the largest broadcasting systems in Europe, broadcasting 1,000 television channels to more than 135 million homes in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

The new spacecraft will be based on the Eurostar Neo platform, Airbus’ new geostationary telecommunications satellite standard design, a significant evolution of the highly reliable and successful Eurostar series with an entire range of major innovations. Eurostar Neo combines increased payload capacity and more efficient power and thermal control systems with reduced production time and optimized costs.

The satellites combine electric power of 22 kW with a launch mass of only 4,500 kg, thanks to the EOR (Electric Orbit Raising) version of the Eurostar Neo platform.

Due for launch in 2021, they will be the ninth and 10th high power all electric Eurostar satellites, harnessing multiple electric propulsion thrusters for faster orbit raising and on-station manoeuvres.

Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “The continuing confidence of Eutelsat in our products means that they are now the launch customer for Eurostar Neo which will be our new flagship telecommunications satellite. They have been our key partner for most of our firsts, including Eurostar E2000+ and Eurostar E3000, as well as electric orbit raising.”

Eutelsat CEO Rodolphe Belmer said: “We are delighted to sign this contract with our long term partner Airbus. It marks another milestone in our objectives to provide customers with premium satellite technology with the highest level of performance, and to expand reliability and service security at the 13 degrees position, which has been our leading neighbourhood for over 20 years, serving Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.”

Nicolas Chamussy continued: “Eurostar Neo combines innovation with tried-and-tested technologies, resulting in a product line that will be as reliable as ever while delivering the best performance in the market. Eurostar Neo will be produced within the digital factory 4.0, a completely new way of manufacturing which will guarantee end-to-end data continuity up to the final in-orbit test results.”

The development of Airbus’ Eurostar Neo platform has been supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and space agencies across Europe in the framework of the ARTES-14 programme line led by ESA and CNES, and strongly supported by the UK Space Agency.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999895095825195}",positive,0.9999895095825195,1
Airbus delivers first European Service Module for NASA's Orion spacecraft - Airbus,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMS1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtZXVyb3BlYW4tc2VydmljZS1tb2R1bGUtZm9yLW5hc2FzLW9yaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe is providing propulsion and life support systems for missions that will take astronauts beyond the Moon

Airbus is leading the European project team on behalf of ESA from Bremen, Germany

First mission in 2020 will herald a new era of human spaceflight

@NASA @Nasa_Orion @ESA @LockheedMartin #OrionESM @AirbusSpace

Bremen, 02 November 2018 – Airbus will deliver the first European Service Module (ESM) for NASA’s Orion spacecraft from its aerospace site in Bremen, Germany on 5 November 2018. An Antonov cargo aircraft will fly the ESM to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA. This is the result of four years of development and construction, and represents the achievement of a key milestone in the project. ESA selected Airbus as the prime contractor for the development and manufacturing of the first ESM in November 2014.

The ESM is a key element of Orion, the next-generation spacecraft that will transport astronauts beyond low Earth orbit for the first time since the end of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. The module provides propulsion, power and thermal control and will supply astronauts with water and oxygen on future missions. The ESM is installed underneath the crew module.

“The delivery of the first European Service Module for NASA’s Orion spacecraft is a hugely significant moment, and NASA’s ground-breaking deep-space mission is continuing to pick up speed. Very soon, the crew module and the service module will come together for the first time at Kennedy Space Center, and integration and testing can then begin,” said Oliver Juckenhöfel, Head of On-Orbit Services and Exploration at Airbus. “Working on the Orion project has cemented our exceptional, efficient and close relationships with our customers, ESA and NASA, and with our industrial partner, Lockheed Martin Space. We are committed to further reinforcing the trust that ESA and NASA have already placed in our know-how and expertise when it comes to the development and construction of the first ESM. We have already begun work on the integration of the second service module in our clean rooms.”

The launch of the Orion spacecraft with NASA’s new Space Launch System rocket is known as Exploration Mission-1 and is scheduled for 2020. This mission will be uncrewed and will take the spacecraft more than 64,000 kilometres beyond the Moon in order to demonstrate its capabilities. The first human spaceflight mission, Exploration Mission-2, is planned for 2022.

The design of the Orion spacecraft enables astronauts to be transported further into Space than ever before. The spacecraft will transport the four astronauts into Space, providing life support for the crew during the flight and enabling a safe return to Earth’s atmosphere, at extremely high re-entry speeds. NASA will use this mission beyond the Moon to develop the capabilities to send humans to Mars – heralding a new era of human spaceflight.

More than 20,000 parts and components are installed in the ESM, from electrical equipment to engines, solar panels, fuel tanks and life support materials, as well as several kilometres of cables and tubing.

The ESM is a cylinder that is around four metres in both height and diameter. Comparable to the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV 2008 – 2015), also built by Airbus, it has a distinctive four-wing solar array (19 metres across when unfurled) that generates enough energy to power two households. The service module’s 8.6 tonnes of fuel can power one main engine and 32 smaller thrusters.

At launch, the ESM weighs a total of just over 13 tonnes. In addition to its function as the main propulsion system for the Orion spacecraft, the ESM will be responsible for orbital manoeuvring and position control. It also provides the crew with the central elements of life support such as water and oxygen, and regulates thermal control while it is docked to the crew module. Furthermore, the unpressurised service module can be used to carry additional payload.

During the development and construction of the ESM, Airbus has drawn on its extensive experience as prime contractor for ESA’s ATV, which provided the crew on board the International Space Station with regular deliveries of test equipment, spare parts, food, air, water and fuel.

Three operating MetOps to further improve weather forecasting

@AirbusSpace @eumetsat @ESA_EO #METOPC #CSTHEDAY #VS19

Kourou, 07 November 2018 - MetOp-C is in orbit: This morning at 01:47 h (CET) a Soyuz launcher lifted-off successfully from the European spaceport Kourou (French Guiana) carrying the four ton weather satellite. Built by Airbus, MetOp-C is the last of the first generation of EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) series of three polar-orbiting satellites. MetOp-C is joining its predecessors MetOp-A and -B in a 817 kilometre orbit. Both predecessors have exceeded their designated lifetime by far. The MetOp programme has made the biggest positive impact on improving the accuracy of weather forecasts from 12 hours to 10 days ahead.

The MetOp satellites have been developed by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, and are part of a joint Europe-US cooperation.

Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, said: “Initially, the plan was for each satellite to replace its predecessor, however, the excellent performance of the first two MetOp satellites allowed a dual operation of MetOp-A and -B with a significant contribution to the reduction of Day-1 forecasting errors. It is expected that this trend will continue with the third spacecraft now in orbit.”

Each MetOp satellite carries a total of 12 instruments (10 for MetOp-C), making the system extremely versatile. Two of the instruments have been built by Airbus: the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The MHS measures water vapour near the Earth’s surface, and as well as flying on the MetOp spacecraft, two additional microwave humidity sounders are already flying on US NOAA satellites, delivering matching data from a different orbit to enhance weather models.

The other Airbus-built instrument, the “Advanced Scatterometer” (ASCAT) is an active radar instrument which measures wind speed and direction over the open sea. It also provides data for ice and snow coverage as well as surface moisture. ASCAT will scan two 500 kilometre wide corridors and can, therefore, provide almost global coverage within 24 hours.

MetOp also monitors the ozone layer in the stratosphere, as well as relaying meteorological measurements collected by boats, buoys and research stations. MetOp-A and -B also feature a receiver to relay signals sent by people in distress.

In addition to the expected benefits on weather forecasting, MetOp-C will continue the time series of data begun by MetOp-A, and this long-term dataset is crucial for climate monitoring.

Under development at Airbus, the MetOp-SG (second generation) spacecraft will provide continuity and enhancement of meteorological data with improved spectral and spatial resolution compared to the measurements currently provided by the first generation of MetOp satellites. A complete range of observations will be realised using 10 different instruments, covering ultra-violet, visible, infrared and microwave spectral bands.

From 2021 onwards, MetOp-SG will further increase the benefits of accurate weather prediction based on state-of-the-art European technologies and keep contributing to socio-economic benefits worth several billion Euros year for European citizens.

First A330-800 becomes airborne for its maiden flight - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMS1maXJzdC1hMzMwLTgwMC1iZWNvbWVzLWFpcmJvcm5lLWZvci1pdHMtbWFpZGVuLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A330-800 flight-test programme now underway;

Flight Test Aircraft MSN1888 will prepare A330-800 for certification.

The first A330-800 took off this morning at Blagnac in Toulouse, France at 10:31am local time, for its maiden flight taking place over south-western France. The aircraft, MSN1888, will perform the dedicated flight-physics tests required for this variant.



The crew in the cockpit comprise: Experimental Test Pilots Malcolm Ridley and François Barre and Test-Flight Engineer Ludovic Girard. Meanwhile, monitoring the aircraft systems and performance in real-time at the flight-test-engineer’s (FTE) station are Catherine Schneider and Jose Corugedo Bermejo. The A330-800’s certification development programme itself will last around 300 flight-test hours, paving the way for certification in 2019. Its sibling, the larger A330-900 family member, recently completed its development testing and certification programme, which validated the A330neo Family’s common engines, systems, cabin and flight & ground operations.

Launched in July 2014, the latest generation of Airbus’ widebody family, the A330neo builds on the A330ceo’s proven economics, versatility and reliability while reducing fuel consumption by a further 14 percent per seat. The NEO’s two versions – the A330-800 and A330-900 – will accommodate 257 and 287 passengers respectively in a three-class seating layout, are powered by the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, offer new “Airspace” cabin amenities and feature a new larger span wing with Sharklet wingtip devices.

The A330 is one of the most popular widebody families ever, having received over 1,700 orders from 120 customers. More than 1,400 A330s are flying with over 120 operators worldwide. The A330neo is the latest addition to the leading Airbus widebody family, which also includes the A350 XWB and the A380, all featuring unmatched space and comfort combined with unprecedented efficiency levels and unrivalled range capability.

Airbus touts A330-800 PaxEx advantage but jet may land with 9-abreast - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMTEvYWlyYnVzLXRvdXRzLWEzMzAtODAwLXBheGV4LWFkdmFudGFnZS1idXQtamV0LW1heS1sYW5kLXdpdGgtOS1hYnJlYXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a successful takeoff of the A330-800’s first flight in Toulouse, Airbus met with gathered press to tout the economic and aerodynamic benefits of the newest member of the A330neo family.

While the A330-800, which is the neo version of the A330-200, could replace aged -200s and Boeing 767s in the market, Airbus has set its sights directly on the Boeing 787-8 as the competing aircraft for comparison.

In terms of cabin capacity, Airbus head of A330 marketing Crawford Hamilton explained that the A330-800 can fit more passengers than the 787-8, regardless of configuration, while offering lower fuel burn.

The airframer attests that the longer fuselage of the A330-800 gives the aircraft an advantage that offsets a narrower tail and still ends up with an up to 27-seat advantage over the 787-8, with a high-density 9-abreast configuration.

Airbus suggests it can offer a 9-abreast A330-800 cabin that would accommodate economy class seats around 17” inches in width, just as on the 787-8. For comparison, current 9-abreast A330s – such as the A330-300s flown by AirAsia X – offer a seat width of just 16.5”, according to SeatGuru. So Airbus may have played with the angles and the sidewalls, as it said it would do for 10-abreast A350s.

The A330-800 cabin itself is the Airspace cabin, which was designed to create more lateral room, compared to older generation A330 models, just as the A330-900 and A350 cabins have been. That might make the 17” possible. But Airbus would not be drawn on the exact specifics today.

Even with an 8-abreast configuration – as is more standard on today’s A330s – airlines can fit 18 more seats on the A330-800 than on an 8-abreast 787-8, notes Airbus.

“If we look at what we do with business class and first class and such like, for both aircraft it’s about equal. But we have a cabin that is 2.5 meters longer [than the 787-8] … which is approximately four rows of seating. We gain 36 seats there. With the same number of 9-abreast seats [we] get about three extra seats, but we have a slightly bigger taper at the end so we lose six there. We also have an under floor crew rest so we lose a few seats there as well. But it’s more efficient than it was previously, because now we have a combined crew rests with pilots in a defined area,” said Hamilton.

There are no announced customers yet for the A330-800 variant, though Airbus expects them. When Runway Girl Network asked whether customers should expect airlines to favor the 8-abreast layout that Airbus now describes as “comfort economy” or 9-abreast configurations, Hamilton replied: “In terms of the first [A330neo] aircraft into service, that’s 8-abreast. But there are customers who have signed who have 9-abreast … and they will be delivered.”

Hamilton could not reveal details about which customers favored 9-abreast seating, and said that cabin configurations are still being drafted and might change.

As mentioned, the A330-800 will be outfitted with the “Airspace by Airbus” cabin that has become the company’s signature cabin. It includes a customizable service area, larger overhead bins, touchless features on lavatories and ergonomic galleys.

Some might argue that the extra inch (plus or minus) on the economy class seat will not make the most dramatic difference to comfort, and that the right structure can ease the squeeze, but in reality a 2-4-2 configuration is more comfortable.

It’s not just about room, but familiarity. The 2-4-2 config allows more opportunities for single travelers to find a widow or aisle and for and couples to sit together. It also leaves room in the middle for families and groups.

A 3-3-3 configuration may fit more seats but fewer people will have their choice of companions and people’s sense of space is affected by proximity to strangers. In terms of comfort, the 9-abreast 787 used by Airbus for comparison has not showered itself in glory in the eyes of passengers.

Airlines will need to examine their markets to see whether squeezing odds together is really worth it on longer flights.

One thing that might make the difference as airlines ponder the best way to optimize revenue on this aircraft is cargo capacity on passenger configurations. Hamilton told RGN that the passenger variant of the aircraft can carry 10-15 metric tons of cargo. He said some A330neo customers have already discovered that they are picking up profitable cargo business to supplement seat revenue, especially on routes to and from Asia.

With the right plans in place, cargo can be profitable enough to pay for a little extra passenger room.

Some have raised concerns that 787 Rolls Royce engine troubles could trickle down to affect the Trent 7000 engines used on the A330neo. Peter Johnston, head of customer marketing at Rolls-Royce, said: “Engine deliveries are ramping up now. They have been slower than we wanted, really, because of pressure in the supply chain on industrial ramp-up, not because of technical issues that we are seeing on the [Dreamliner] Trent 1000 engines. Those are two separate topics.”

Both of these widebody aircraft incorporate new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, nacelle, titanium pylon, new wings and offer an exclusive ‘Airspace by Airbus’ passenger experience. The larger A330-900 will accommodate up to 287 seats in a typical three-class layout, while the A330-800 typically will seat 257 passengers in three classes.

At the end of September 2018, Airbus’ orderbook includes 14 customers who have placed orders for a total of 224 A330neos, with more to be added soon.

Background for editors: A330-800 overview

The A330-800 is the second member of the A330neo family and is the market’s newest-generation 250-seat aircraft, and is also the new entry-level widebody aircraft in the Airbus Family. Based on the A330-200, which itself has sold 650+ aircraft with hundreds of operators, the new -800 version offers an even greater range capability of up to 8,150nm (similar to the A350) and representing more than 17 hours flying time, which covers 98 percent of all widebody routes flown today. This performance, which is made possible thanks to the NEO’s 3D-optimised wing, fuel-efficient Trent 7000 engines and a new optional maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 251 metric tonnes, unlocks up to 1,300nm more range versus the earlier A330-200 models and enables non-stop routes from South-East Asia to Europe and transpacific routes from South East Asia to the US West Coast. Moreover, with its superior economics, range, cabin comfort and passenger experience versus the 787-8, the A330-800 is also best placed to replace ageing 767s in the near-term, and eventually the older A330-200s, in service.

The A330 is one of the most popular widebody families ever, having received over 1,700 orders from 120 customers. More than 1,400 A330s are flying with over 120 operators worldwide.

The first upgraded aircraft, G-POLF, was first delivered to UK police in 2002 and, with more than 15,000 flight hours, is a global H135 fleet leader. The standardised upgrade, common to all seven helicopters, will deliver the latest NVIS capability and bring these aircraft in line with NPAS’ current NVIS-capable H135 fleet, allowing NPAS to benefit from commonality across the entire fleet.

Oliver Dismore, NPAS T/Accountable Manager, said, “Airbus Helicopters’ UK design team is recognised as a European leader in the design and integration of night vision capabilities across the company’s range of helicopters, while the company’s 30 year heritage supporting the development of UK police aviation and their collaborative approach has meant the impact on fleet availability and operations has been minimised.”

Colin James, UK Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters, highlighted, “Whether designing innovative rotary-wing solutions for UK and overseas customers or supporting UK helicopter fleet availability, our aircraft are the best fit for policing and emergency services missions and our UK team, working 24/7 from sites across the UK, ensures these can be relied on to deliver day in, day out.”

The upgrade includes stripping and re-equipping the majority of cockpit instrumentation across all seven helicopters, including flight and mission equipment and new FENN700+ night vision goggles, to precisely the same standard. NPAS will now operate an enhanced night vision capability across its H135 fleet while standardisation ensures ease of use for pilots and crew.

Airbus Corporate Jets Sends Its New Bizliner Off into the Wild Blue Yonder - Robb Report,"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtamV0cy1zZW5kcy1uZXctYWNqMzIwbmVvLWJpemxpbmVyLXdpbGQtYmx1ZS15b25kZXItMjgzMDQxMC_SAXdodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL21vdG9ycy9hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWpldHMtc2VuZHMtbmV3LWFjajMyMG5lby1iaXpsaW5lci13aWxkLWJsdWUteW9uZGVyLTI4MzA0MTAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On November 16, Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) pushed its newest bird out of the nest, sending off the first ACJ320neo on its inaugural flight. The corporate version of the Airbus A320neo jetliner, the new aircraft departed from Airbus’s factory in Hamburg, Germany, bound for Basel, Switzerland, where it will have its cabin interior completed and its exterior repainted in the acquiring company’s livery.

The flight only lasted two hours and 40 minutes, but it represents an important milestone for the ACJ320neo family, which also includes the ACJ319neo, whose first delivery is expected to follow next year. Though commercial A320neos were announced in 2010 and have been in operation since 2016, the first ACJ320neo order came in in 2015, when Acropolis Aviation—based out of Farnborough airport in England—bought one of the jets. However, even though it is the first ACJ320neo, its built on a platform that has proven itself at this point, with around 500 A320neos already in commercial service.

The new business jet can seat up to 19 passengers, though private owners can outfit the jet however they see fit, perhaps even adopting the Melody concept from Airbus or enlisting a designer like Winch Design to implement its “home in the sky” interior concept. Either way, you won’t be at a loss for space: its cabin is a just shy of 90 feet in length and its width comes in at 12 feet and two inches. And you can be sure none of your guests will have to stoop (except for the tallest of NBA players) thanks to its 7-foot, 5-inch cabin height.

With a range of 6,905 miles under the right conditions, the jet can fly nearly anywhere in the world in one stop. This is in part thanks to its new, more efficient engines; the neo nomenclature actually stands for “new engine option,” which is one of the main differences between it and the previous ACJ320 generation. Between the engines and the new drag reducing winglets, the 320neo cuts fuel consumption by 15 percent.

The thing we’re most excited about? Bringing you images and videos of some of the outlandish interior that the blank canvases of the ACJ320neos are sure to provide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998903274536133}",neutral,0.9998903274536133,0

The H125 at the top of the world - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTExLXRoZS1oMTI1LWF0LXRoZS10b3Atb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud - Photos: Fishtail Air and Air Dynasty.

Article adapted from Rotor magazine #112.

The challenges of climbing in the Himalayas are legendary. So are the challenges of flying there, yet many a climber owes thanks to the H125 and its pilots.

“Our pilots have to take precautions,” says Suman Pandey, CEO of Fishtail Air. “There are many things they need to be careful of.”

Flying in the Himalayan mountains is no picnic, yet the pilots and helicopters that carry out thousands of mountain rescues annually play an essential role there. Every year, people come to Nepal to experience one of Earth’s most extreme environments. Mount Everest, at 29,029 feet (8,848 m), draws high-altitude climbers and trekkers. With no road transportation to Lukla’s TenzingHillary Airport – the staging point for Everest expeditions – air transport is the only way travelers can make the trip from Kathmandu—or be evacuated back. Flights are a technical feat, as the majority of rescues are at altitudes from 12,000 to 17,000 feet. Many more take place from Everest’s Base Camp 2, at 21,000 feet (6,400 m).

CHALLENGES TO MAN AND MACHINE

“Our pilots have to be careful about altitude, so they go oxygen-equipped before taking off,” says Pandey. “They have to be careful of the wind. When there is snow on the ground, there are problems with light reflections. They have to be careful at the landing area, and the hardness of the ground.” The pilots’ physical burdens are matched by those placed on the aircraft. To perform at such a high density altitude, the helicopters can’t be too heavy, so they take off from Kathmandu with marginal fuel and refuel on their return journey. Engines are kept running during rescues. Takeoffs are done into a head wind to help with lift, since many landing spots are in a bowl in the mountainside, surrounded by peaks.

The H125 is the best machine that I’ve flown in my 14 years as a pilot.

- Shashwot Dulal, captain with Air Dynasty.

NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART

The majority of rescues happen during the fall and spring, yet operators undertake missions year-round. Climbers succumb to frost bite, heat exhaustion (spots on the mountain can reach 90 °F or 20 to 30 °C), snow blindness, and altitude sickness. “We have people who get sick in the high altitude and our main mission is to bring them down,” says Pandey. “Some fall and have accidents. Some get lost and we do search and rescue evacuation. Some are stuck at high altitudes, including Annapurna rescues [another Himalayan peak], and we evacuate them at different elevations, and by using a long line.”

The H125 is the acknowledged pro, comprising 85% of the light single-engine fleet in Nepal. “The H125 is the best machine that I’ve flown in my 14 years as a pilot,” says Shashwot Dulal, a captain with operator Air Dynasty. “It has good performance. At Camp 2, it’s difficult to carry anything but we always have engine power, so we can rescue from those altitudes.”

For Dulal, one rescue stands out. “I conducted a flight at Lobuche, at around 16,000 feet,” says Dulal. “The climber had broken her leg and was suffering from altitude sickness. The weather was really bad. I took off from under the clouds and went to the glacier. It took time to bring up the passenger and I saw the clouds starting to come in, and almost impossible conditions. We always do a takeoff into the wind but that time, I had to take off tailwind, and I had to use a lot of power to climb. It was a big challenge for me, bad weather at 16,000 feet and a critical patient on board. I could have waited, but the patient would not have been in a good condition, so I came down to Lukla and back to Kathmandu. That was really a top mission for me.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996563196182251}",neutral,0.9996563196182251,0

The A330-800 has completed its maiden flight, with this highly-efficient addition to the A330 twin-engine widebody jetliner product line performing an evaluation lasting four hours and four minutes from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport.

The Airbus crew for this first flight – Captain François Barre, Copilot Malcom Ridley, Test Flight Engineer Ludovic Girard, as well as Flight Test Engineers Catherine Schneider and Jose Angel Corugedo Bermejo – put the aircraft through its paces and highlighted the new-generation jetliner’s operational advantages.



As the second member of the A330neo Family, the A330-800 is the most efficient, longest-range entry-level widebody aircraft. It joins the longer-fuselage A330-900 variant, which offers the lowest seat-mile cost in midsize widebody category and will soon be entering airline service with launch operator TAP Air Portugal.

The A330-800 and A330-900 have more than 99% commonality across the two A330neo versions, and they share the same type rating with the other members of Airbus’ A330 Family – which are the best-selling midsize widebody aircraft ever. Additionally, the two A330neo aircraft have a common type rating with the A350 XWB, facilitating pilots’ transition among these widebody Airbus aircraft for maximum efficiency.

A highly-efficient member of the A330neo Family

Passenger capacity of the A330-800 variant is 257 passengers in a three-class configuration, with the A330-900 version seating 287 passengers with similar typical three-class layout.

The A330neo has the quietest and most comfortable cabin in its category. Fitted with the new Airspace by Airbus cabin, the A330neo features an innovative and customisable entrance, full LED ambient lighting, new lavatories, as well as the latest in-flight entertainment system for an exclusive experience aloft.

Rolls-Royce’s Trent 7000 powers the A330-800 and A330-900, offering a significant reduction in fuel burn. With 25 percent less fuel consumption than previous generation aircraft, these A330neo jetliners can travel farther with lower operating costs. For the A330-800, this results in a range of up to 8,150 nautical miles, enabling non-stop flights between Southeast Asia and Europe, as well as transpacific travel between Southeast Asia and the U.S. West Coast.

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus delivered its first A330neo jet to TAP Portugal on Monday as it seeks to trump U.S. rival Boeing in the fiercely competitive battle at the lower end of the market for long-haul jets.

The face-off between the A330neo and Boeing 787 pits two generations of jetliner against each other in one of the most crowded but potentially lucrative parts of the aircraft market, predicted to represent $1 trillion in sales over 20 years.

Airbus said its upgraded A330neo, seating 250-298 passengers, would dovetail with the European planemaker's hot-selling A321neo narrowbody jet, which seats about 200, in the race to address a gap between single-aisle and twin-aisle jets.

Boeing is weighing up proposals to develop a new-generation jet carrying 220-270 passengers in a development analysts say could severely hurt the A330, the most profitable Airbus series.

The European planemaker is attempting to close its jaws around the same part of the market through a combination of the A330-800neo and the smaller A321neo, industry strategists say.

Sales of the A330neo have fallen short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from Boeing's 787, but the head of Airbus twin-aisle marketing predicted that it would hold its ground in the same way as the current A330 has done after Boeing was hit by production delays on the 787.

Despite weighing more than Boeing's 787 because of its metal structure, Airbus says the A330neo saves airlines money because of a more efficient wing.

Boeing, however, says the lightweight composite design of its 787 wins on economics despite its higher sticker price.

The aircraft delivered to TAP Portugal on Monday is the 298-seat A330-900neo, the larger of two versions developed by Airbus and one that dominates the tally of 242 aircraft on order.

The smaller A330-800neo took its first flight this month.

Airbus launched the revamped A330neo series in 2014 after failing to win as many orders as it had hoped for the A350-800, the smallest version of its own new-generation composite jet, the A350, which competes with most 787s and the larger 777.

The first A330neo delivery was delayed by setbacks at Britain's Rolls-Royce , which recently rescheduled deliveries of the Trent 7000 engine as it focuses on resolving difficulties with a sister engine that powers some Boeing 787s.

This occasion marks another step forward to meeting our industry’s goal for sustainable aviation,” he added.

The A330neo is a true new generation aircraft building on the A330’s success and leveraging on A350 XWB technology. It incorporates the highly efficient new generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, and a new higher span 3D optimised wing with new sharklets fully optimized for the best aerodynamic performance. Together these advances bring a significant reduction in fuel consumption of 25 percent compared with older generation competitor aircraft of a similar size. Moreover, new composite nacelles, a fully-faired titanium pylon and zero-splice air inlet technology provide the A330-900 with state-of-the-art aerodynamics and acoustics.

Airbus and TAP already have a long and happy relationship, dating back to 1987, when TAP commissioned three Airbus A310 aircraft. Today, TAP Air Portugal operates an Airbus fleet of 72 aircraft: 18 A330s, four A340s and 50 from the A320 family (A319, A320 and A321).

This year alone, TAP has already received six new Airbus aircraft: one Airbus A319ceo, one Airbus A320ceo, one A320-251neo, two A321-251neo - the last of which last week – and, now, TAP receives the first Airbus A330neo in the world for its long haul fleet.

About TAP Portugal

TAP is Portugal’s leading airline and a member of the global airline Star Alliance since 2005. Flying since 1945, TAP celebrated its 70th anniversary on March 14, 2015, before completing its privatization process later that year, now with the Atlantic Gateway Group as private shareholders.

TAP’s network comprises 84 destinations in 34 countries worldwide. The airline currently operates around 2,500 weekly flights, with a modern fleet of 63 Airbus aircraft. TAP Express, the airline’s regional arm, operates an additional 17 aircraft.

With TAP’s privatization process, it has restructured its network, launched new fare products and is renewing its medium and long-haul fleet. TAP has 53 Airbus neo aircraft on order and, by 2020, its long-haul fleet will either have been replaced with new aircraft or newly reconfigured aircraft. TAP Express now operates a new fleet of 8 ATR 72 and 9 Embraer 190.

TAP is one of Europe’s most awarded airlines. Global Traveler (USA) named TAP as Best Airline in Europe from 2011 to 2016, and the World Travel Awards named TAP as both Europe’s Leading Airline to Africa and Europe’s Leading Airline to South America from 2014 – 2017. Previously TAP was awarded World’s Leading Airline to Africa, in 2011 and 2012, and World’s Leading Airline to South America from 2009 through 2012. TAP’s Inflight Magazine, UP, received the World Travel Award as Europe’s Leading In-flight Magazine for 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Vietjet to finalize $6.5 billion Airbus order: sources - Egypt Today,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVneXB0dG9kYXkuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMy81OTc5NC9WaWV0amV0LXRvLWZpbmFsaXplLTYtNS1iaWxsaW9uLUFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1zb3VyY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380 is taking part in a flying display during the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 23, 2017 - REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol

HONG KONG - 1 November 2018: Fast-growing budget carrier Vietjet Aviation is set to finalize a $6.5 billion jet order with Europe’s Airbus during a visit to Hanoi by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Friday, people familiar with the matter said.



The order for 50 A321neo jets is part of an aggressive investment in the Vietnamese airline’s fleet that has provided lucrative business for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing.



It is also a boost for Airbus as it seeks to turn a raft of provisional orders put together at July’s Farnborough Airshow into hard revenues, narrowing a gap against Boeing this year.



The deal is the biggest economic component of an official visit to France’s former colony by Philippe from Nov. 2-4, during which he will oversee deals with French firms and hold talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc, they said.



Airbus and Vietjet both declined to comment.



Vietnam and France also signed an agreement in September to expand defense collaboration, although details are scant.



VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao told Reuters this week that Vietjet plans to maintain an average fleet age of just three years to keep fuel and maintenance costs low.



It placed provisional orders for the A321neo jets and 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets at the Farnborough Airshow and has been negotiating to firm them up, with deliveries expected between 2020 and 2025.



The latest deal will help to dispel doubts over the substance of deals announced in Farnborough, which was marked by a rash of vague or incomplete announcements.



However, aircraft finance industry sources have expressed doubts over whether all the planes ordered by Vietjet will be delivered on schedule amid a glut of airplane orders in Asia.



Vietnam’s expansion has also been peppered with trade sensitivities as Vietjet juggled Airbus and Boeing procurements, a strategy also designed to win bigger discounts.



Two years ago, Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching a bumper order for 100 737 MAX jets during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Until then, VietJet had only bought from Airbus, including a similar order for 92 jets in 2013.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999585151672363}",neutral,0.9999585151672363,0

The first ACJ320neo made a successful first flight from Hamburg on November 16, 2018.

Derived from the popular A320neo airliner family, some 500 of which are in airline service, the corporate jet version includes features such as extra fuel-tanks in the cargo-hold that will deliver even more intercontinental range, plus greater cabin-pressure for better passenger comfort.

These features are being tested before delivery of the aircraft to Acropolis Aviation in the coming months. The aircraft will then undergo cabin outfitting by AMAC in Basle, Switzerland, and be repainted in customer colors.

“The ACJ320neo first flight heralds a new Airbus corporate jet era, delivering a range improvement that enables nonstop travel between even more cities, in what is widely recognized as the best cabin of any business jet,” said ACJ President Benoit Defforge. “The ACJ320neo Family’s improved fuel-efficiency also means that it compares even more favorably in operating costs with traditional business-jets,” he added.

Continuous improvements mean that the ACJ320 Family now comprises the ACJ319neo, flying eight passengers 6,750 nm/12,500 km or more than 15 hours, and the ACJ320neo, flying 25 passengers 6,000 nm/11,100 km or more than 13 hours.

On hand for the delivery ceremony at the aircraft’s assembly line in Mirabel were members of the A220 team as well as government officials and executives from Delta, Airbus, Bombardier and Investissement Quebec.

“It is with great pride that we take delivery of our first, state-of-the-art A220-100,” said Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian. “We have big plans for our A220 fleet and are confident that Delta customers and Delta people alike will be delighted with the in-flight experience provided by this thoroughly modern and efficient aircraft. We value our longstanding partnerships with Airbus and Bombardier and are grateful for the great design and manufacturing work done by the team here in Mirabel.”

Delta’s A220 will enter service in early 2019, making Delta the fourth global airline to operate the aircraft previously known as the Bombardier C Series. The C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP) welcomed Airbus as lead partner earlier this year, prompting the change of name to the Airbus A220. Delta is the largest A220-100 customer, with a firm order for 75 aircraft.

Guillaume Faury, President of Airbus’ commercial aircraft business, said, “We at Airbus are dedicated to providing our customers the right products for a marketplace that needs modern, efficient and passenger-friendly aircraft – and the remarkable A220 certainly delivers. When a great airline like Delta puts a new aircraft into service as a platform for their outstanding passenger service, the entire industry takes note. The A220 team is gratified by the confidence that the Delta family has placed in this excellent, Canadian-born aircraft.”

The A220-100 delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency. It brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

With an order book of over 400 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market, estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

As of the end of September, Delta was operating a fleet of 235 Airbus aircraft, including 182 A320 Family members, as well as 42 A330s and 11 A350 XWB, or eXtra Wide Body aircraft. The airline has more than 275 additional Airbus aircraft on order.

Airbus considering regional A330neo - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMS8yOC9haXJidXMtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctcmVnaW9uYWwtYTMzMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus considering regional A330neo

The Airbus A330neo is currently bathing in attention, with the delivery of the first A330-900 to TAP Air Portugal a few days ago and the maiden flight of the A330-800 earlier this month.

Despite this attention being focused on the two A330neo members which make up the revamped family, Airbus is looking at whether to offer a regional variant of the A330neo to airlines that want to fly short trips with high load factors.

With Boeing set to make a decision on the ‘797’ in the coming year, Airbus wants to ensure they’re in a position to counter their move, even though they’re confident the A321neo, A321LR and potential A321XLR can cover the market, with the A330neo taking over the slightly longer and heavier routes. Airlines are still waiting to see what Boeing is considering, however the A320 and A330 families are proven and would see any new developments or modifications enter the market much sooner that Boeing’s proposed ‘797’ entry into service in the mid 2020s.

Regional variants of medium to long haul aircraft come to fruition by reducing engine thrust and adjusting systems, which ultimately reduces the fuel load and burn as well as maintenance. Paperwork adjustments will see the maximum takeoff weight reduced to lower takeoff, landing and airport fees.

Regional variants of the A330 aren’t a new concept, however, with Airbus announcing the A330-300 Regional in 2013 as having a reduced maximum takeoff weight of 199 tons, lowered engine power and lowered range. Combining the modifications, Airbus advertised the aircraft to offer 26% lower operating costs than the standard A330-300. Saudia was the launch customer for this type.

Current models of the A330neo have a maximum takeoff weight of 242 metric tons, however engineers have stated a 200 ton option is easily accomplished. The target engine thrust for this takeoff weight option would be around 68,000 pounds of thrust, which is a 4000 pound reduction from the 72,000 pounds Rolls-Royce advertises with the Trent 7000 – the only engine option for the A330neo.

As Airbus’ management takes a major leap in the rapidly approaching 2019, announcements for future aircraft developments in the widebody and narrowbody segment are expected. Confidence is evident in the company, with statements about the A330neo Family and A320 Family working hard to close the gap between single-aisle and long range flying.

Customers for these potential developments are part of these announcements expected in 2019, which is also when more airlines will begin looking at options for their A330 fleet replacement strategies. Part of the presentation Airbus had during the delivery of the first A330neo was the fact that it entered the market before the full replacement cycle kicks in. Will they satisfy their thirst for more orders or will Boeing continue to strangle them with the 787 Dreamliner?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999887228012085}",neutral,0.999887228012085,0
Delta Boosts Its Order for the Slow-Selling Airbus A330neo - The Motley Fool,"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE4LzExLzIwL2RlbHRhLWJvb3N0cy1pdHMtb3JkZXItc2xvdy1zZWxsaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwbmVvLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The U.S. airline giant has added 10 more A330-900neos to its order book -- and it moved the first delivery up to 2019.

Four years ago, Delta Air Lines (DAL 0.66%) ordered 25 Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) A330-900neos. Delta became Airbus' first marquee customer for the A330neo family, which had been officially launched just a few months earlier.

Since then, Airbus has struggled to build up a robust backlog of A330neo orders. But last week, Delta announced that it has ordered 10 additional A330-900neos -- and that it may continue to add to that order in future years.

A disappointing start

Airbus hoped that Delta's initial A330neo order would provide a seal of approval for the updated version of its A330 wide-body family, giving other airlines the confidence to order the new models.

However, the Delta deal failed to drive much in the way of additional order activity. Airbus already had 121 commitments for the A330neo before it received the Delta order in late 2014. As of the end of September 2018, Airbus had only 224 firm orders for the A330neo family.

This has forced Airbus to steadily reduce its production plans for the A330 family as a whole. The European aerospace giant plans to deliver just 50 A330s (including both the first-generation models and the ""neo"" models) in 2019, down from more than 100 annually between 2012 and 2015. To avoid further production cuts -- and eventually return to production growth -- Airbus needs to secure more orders.

More A330neos coming -- and they're arriving sooner

Last Friday, Delta Air Lines and Airbus confirmed that the airline has expanded its A330-900neo order by 10 units, to a total of 35 aircraft. At the same time, Delta deferred its last 10 orders for the longer-range (and pricier) A350-900 to 2025 and 2026. It also has further flexibility on that order, and it could eventually convert the remaining 10 A350 orders to A330neos.

This order almost certainly explains the 10 A330-900neos that showed up in Airbus' backlog last month, attributed to an unidentified customer.

Delta also accelerated its A330neo deliveries. (Or, to be more accurate, it reversed a previous delay to its delivery schedule.) The carrier had originally planned to receive its first four A330-900neos in 2019, but by the beginning of this year, it expected the first four deliveries to come in 2020. Now, Delta expects to receive its first A330neo in 2019 once again.

The A330-900neo has enough range to cover the vast majority of Delta's current routes. Some of these aircraft may be used for growth (especially in the lucrative transatlantic market), but they will mainly replace Delta's oldest Boeing 767s. Indeed, Delta has 19 767s that are at least 25 years old today -- and thus near the end of their useful lives -- and dozens more that were built in the mid to late 1990s and will be ripe for replacement a few years down the road.

A smart choice for Delta

The A330-900neo will be much cheaper to operate on a per-seat basis than Delta's 767s. This order will contribute to the carrier's effort to hold annual non-fuel unit cost increases to less than 2%, while improving fuel efficiency.

Meanwhile, by accelerating the delivery schedule a bit, Delta Air Lines will also be able to build up its inventory of international premium economy seats faster, without having to invest in cabin modifications for older planes that will be retired soon anyway.

Many airlines are reluctant to order aircraft types like the A330neo, which don't seem to be catching on with other operators.

This latest order supports Delta’s international growth strategy in the near to medium term.

Simultaneously, Delta and Airbus have agreed to defer 10 previously ordered A350 XWBs to 2025-26 in order to accommodate the airline’s long-term growth strategy. Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects a further four in 2019-2020. Delta’s A330 fleet stands today 42 widebody aircraft.

“The A330-900 is going to be an important addition to Delta’s fleet,” said Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian. “Airbus has infused this next generation of the successful A330 family with new technology and features providing advanced levels of comfort for our passengers and significant operating cost reductions that will make our airline stronger in the decades to come.”

“Operational efficiency and an exceptional passenger experience are core to Delta’s successful recipe, and it speaks volumes that they have chosen the A330-900,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “Delta has been endorsing the Airbus wide-body family from the outset by committing to both the A330 and the A350. We are listening to our customers and proud to be in the position to flexibly respond to their fleet requirements for more A330s and equally appreciate the ongoing commitment for more A350s as part of their long-term growth strategy.”

Scherer added: “This reconfirmed endorsement by one of the world’s largest and most respected airlines validates the economic credentials of our versatile Airbus widebody family in the most advanced and competitive environments.”

Building on the proven success of its popular twin-aisle, twin-engine, widebody A330 Family, Airbus launched the A330neo programme – comprising the A330-800 and A330-900 versions – in July 2014. The A330neo brings significant efficiency improvements while also introducing the Airspace by Airbus cabin, which offers the newest and most advanced in-flight experience with extra personal space and state-of-the-art ambient lighting.

Incorporating the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, along with aerodynamic enhancements – including new extended composite wingtips which provide 3.7 metres of increased overall span – as well as increased lift and reduced drag, the A330neo is a more efficient aircraft which will generate savings through reduced fuel burn.

The longer-fuselage A330-900 version can accommodate 287 seats in a typical three-class layout or up to 440 for high-density configurations and can provide a range of 7,200 nautical miles.

Extending Combat Air Capabilities With Unmanned Systems: An Airbus Defence and Space Perspective from the ... - Second Line of Defense,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3NsZGluZm8uY29tLzIwMTgvMTEvZXh0ZW5kaW5nLWNvbWJhdC1haXItY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzLXdpdGgtdW5tYW5uZWQtc3lzdGVtcy1hbi1haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2UtcGVyc3BlY3RpdmUtZnJvbS10aGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1maWdodGVyLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtMjAxOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Robbin Laird

At the 2018 International Fighter Conference held in Berlin from November 13-15 2018, one of the topics for presentation and discussion is the European concept and approach to what is being called the Future Combat Air System.

Here the target is to shape a new combat system by 2040, which will drive change in both European industry and force structure.

The presentation by Bruno Fichefeux, Head of the FCAS Programme in Airbus Defence and Space, focused on a key building block in the FCAS trajectory, namely working manned-unmanned teaming.

As Airbus Defence and Space already builds and supports two key non-fighter elements for a 21stcentury combat force, namely the A330MRTT and the A400M and is working through 2 “big wing” potential contributors to the integrated battlespace, namely: The EuroMALE Unmanned Air Systems and the A320neo multi-mission aircraft, it is clear that a core opportunity for Airbus Defence and Space rests on shaping FCAS as a business approach for legacy as well as newly introduced combat systems.

The manned-unmanned teaming research and approach clearly can do both, namely, build towards a new combat fighter capability in the 2040s and support the evolution of air combat fleets, whether operating legacy or fifth generation assets.

In his presentation, Fichefeux argued that manned-unmanned teaming would be increasingly part of the combat air space and function as remote carriers. The manned and unmanned assets would collaborate in the battlespace and be connected through a combat cloud ecosystem.

At the heart of the ability to shape such a future, software needs to be developed which allows for manned-unmanned teaming and as that software evolves, the capability to manage swarming and its effects would become part of the combat force.

The graphic below captures how he has conceptualized the approach and the effort.

He underscored that although the vision is futuristic, the needs are not.

And he mentioned in his brief that Airbus Defence and Space had recently demonstrated the manned-unmanned teaming approach in a dynamic display to a wider audience in order to visualize the obvious benefits it has for air warfare already today.

After his presentation, I had a chance to sit down with Bruno Fichefeux to discuss the experiment and how that experiment laid down a building block for the future. He explained that Airbus Defence and Space put a core software development team together to work the integration necessary for a manned aircraft to work a team of remotes to execute a variety of missions.

The focus was upon the pilot in the cockpit setting the tasks and passing that task off to the swarm of remote carriers, which then would distribute among themselves and execute the task or mission autonomously.

The team worked for a year preparing for the experiment, which was conducted in the North of Germany over the Baltic Sea and the experiment was conducted a month ago. The team used off the shelf drones and equipment; the focus was on the software development.

Five drones were flown in formation flight with a C2 manned aircraft, which provided real time mission tasking.

“The pilot is not piloting the drones; he is just giving the swarm a High level command which then sort out their mission allocation among themselves. You give the machines the task; and then it executes the task.”

As the tasking requires only a minimum of attention from the pilot the teaming has far more benefits than costs.

Customers were invited to the experiment and invited to set unplanned tasks during the course of the experiment underscoring the flexibility of the software rather than having a scripted pre-programmed event.

The capability demonstrated by Airbus Defence and Space is a core one for them going forward.

Rather than being considered primarily a platform company, with the FCAS transformation process, software development, integration and evolution of a team of combat assets becomes a core focus of attention.

While the tangible part of Remote Carriers is expected to be relatively simple in architecture and as such affordable and potentially attritable, the Remote Carrier’s brain and behavior will be the valuable game changer on the battlefield.

And given the company’s significant capabilities in a variety of lift, tanking, ISR and C2 platforms already, clearly these platforms and their evolution and the formulation of a new platform approach will be informed by this core software development and integration capability.

Teaming capability in the connected battlespace is a core competence being worked by Airbus Defence and Space, and they will work as well to inform Eurofighter evolution as well with these new and evolving capabilities.

In the past, Airbus Defence and Space had worked the Barracuda program, performing the first “European made” Unmanned Air System mission on air which was designed to provide Eurofighter with an unmanned partner.

This experiment built on that effort to extend it to the swarming environment.

Fichefeux underscored the importance of working non-stove piped software approaches so that cross-domain interoperability would be enhanced.

“By developing common cross-domain mission systems software for manned and remote air platforms, we can get the kind of interoperability we need and is a core goal of the FCAS program.

“The platform is much less relevant than the teaming capability and intelligence you put into it; and the way you allocate the performance among the manned-remote capabilities as a system.”

He added a key point:

“Following this rationale, many existing airframes can be transformed into Remote Carriers and taken into real missions where they reduce the risk for the legacy manned assets already tomorrow.”

The International Fighter Conference is held by IQPC and next year’s conference will be also held in Berlin from November 12-14 2019 and if this year’s conference is anything to go by, it is highly recommended that persons interested in the evolution of the air combat force attend.

Although the focus is upon fighters, given the evolution combat, the scope is rapidly expanding to a discussion of operations in the integrated battlespace.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.993827760219574}",neutral,0.993827760219574,0

Nov. 26 (UPI) -- Serbian Minister of Defense Aleksandar Vulin has accepted the first H145M helicopter for the Serbian Air Force at the Airbus Helicopters Donauwörth site in Germany. The delivery, announced by Airbus on Friday, is the first of nine helicopters Serbia is set to receive from the company. Advertisement

Two more H145Ms are planned to be delivered to the Serbian Ministry of Interior in December, and four will eventually be delivered to the Serbian air force equipped with the HForce weapon management system designed for light attack roles.

""We assess the implementation of the contract as an example of successful cooperation and positive business practice,"" Vulin said at a ceremony marking the delivery.

""We are particularly pleased to point out that the activities of the industrial cooperation covered by the contract are taking place within the planned timelines,"" Vulin added.

The contract involves technology transfers, spare parts, tools and other maintenance equipment along with certification of the Serbian Moma Stanojlovic aircraft plant to maintain them and Gazelle light helicopters. Serbia and Airbus plan to make the plant a supplier for export of parts and services for the helicopters.

The Н145M can come with several kinds of modular payloads that are installed or removed depending on the mission. It is a digitally controlled twin-engine helicopter already in use by Germany, Hungary and other countries. Airbus claims that it is the quietest helicopter in it's size-class, making its approach harder to detect at low altitude.

It can function as a general purpose utility helicopter or be outfitted for surveillance, medical evacuation, search rescue and armed reconnaissance.

The Serbian H145s will have cameras, ballistic panels for light armor, fast ropes and fire support systems, as well as electronic countermeasures.

HForce is a weapons management system designed to outfit military and civilian helicopters as light attack platforms, including rockets, machine guns, guided missiles and targeting pods.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999804496765137}",neutral,0.9999804496765137,0

MSN 1888, the first Airbus A330-800neo, has performed its maiden flight, taking the A330neo family as a whole, one step closer to being complete.

The aircraft took off from Toulouse Blagnac, France at 10:31am local time. The following crew members are onboard the flight:

Experimental Test Pilot Malcom Ridley

Experimental Test Pilot Francois Barre

Test-Flight Engineer Ludovic Girard

Flight-Test-Engineer Catherine Schneider

Flight-Test-Engineer Jose Corugedo Bermejo

Since the A330-900 has been certified and has completed the bulk of the testing, the A330-800 will only perform a roughly 300h long campaign, focusing on flight physics. Ground handling, maintenance, aircraft systems and flight operations are the same as on the larger A330-900.

Two Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines power the A330neo family, and despite the production delays recently announced by Rolls-Royce, have been performing on spec, and in some cases, better than Airbus expected.

Although there are no firm orders for the A330-800, Airbus isn’t worried. The replacement cycle for A330s of the current engine option is not yet here, however is approaching at a steady speed. When airlines begin to look for replacements, Airbus is confident the A330neo will act as a good aircraft and stand strong against its closest competitor, the Boeing 787.

The first A330-900 is expected to be handed over to launch customer TAP Air Portugal in the very near future. Airbus aimed to have 15 A330-900s delivered by the end of the year but engine delays might cause an issue for this figure.

Airbus released this inforgraphic to outline the key features of the A330-800:

During the world tour of the A330-900, the aircraft was praised for its excellent interior acoustics, which is all part of the passenger experience improvement scheme that comes with the Airspace cabin. This will be the same on the A330-800 which shares a common cabin with the A330-900.

An “In the Making” video was released by Airbus prior to the flight, which you can watch here:

Here are some additional photos from Airbus of the first flight:

Once the aircraft nears the end of its campaign and airlines begin to look for replacements, the A330-800 will gain some orders. The A330neo will build from the original A330 and its success in the widebody market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9588451385498047}",neutral,0.9588451385498047,0
