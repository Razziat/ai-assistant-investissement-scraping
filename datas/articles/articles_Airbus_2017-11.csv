Airbus will test its Vahana electric 'flying car' by the end of 2017 - The Verge,"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE3LzExLzEzLzE2NjMzMzkyL2FpcmJ1cy12YWhhbmEtZmx5aW5nLWNhci1hLWN1YmVkLXBob3Rvc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is making progress on its new electric-powered vertical take-off and landing aircraft — colloquially (and incorrectly) known as a “flying car.” The European aerospace giant posted a series of photos today from its Vahana project, showing its team working on a pair of single-seat, tilt-rotor vehicles with a paint job that would make a Stormtrooper envious.

Airbus has said it wants to build a fleet of electric, autonomous, multirotor VTOL aircraft that can be used to fly from rooftop to rooftop in dense cities where traffic is often at a standstill. The project launched in early 2016 as one of the first pursuits of A³ (pronounced A-cubed), its Silicon Valley subsidiary. (Vahana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the vehicle or mount of a god.) Since then, the company has reported regular updates, including a concept video of the user experience.

In its post, the company says that a full-scale demonstrator is currently under production, with the goal of taking flight by the end of the year. The prototype was recently moved from California to a new flight test center in Pendleton, Oregon, where it will conduct its first demonstration. A³ has said it plans to have a production-ready version by 2020.

Airbus, which competes with the US-based Boeing, is best known for large jetliners like the double-decker A380. However, the flying car project shows that the Toulouse, France-based company is not above dabbling in some high-concept, and perhaps unrealistic, aviation ideas."

Leahy reflects on 33 years at Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMS8yOC9sZWFoeS1yZWZsZWN0cy0zMy15ZWFycy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"John Leahy will retire in January and stay for a short transition to help his successor, Eric Schulz, who was named EVP, Chief of Sales, Marketing and Contracts. Leahy is Chief Operating Officer-Customers. During his three-decade long tenure at Airbus, the company moved from a single-digit market share to surpassing Boeing for more than a decade in sales. Leahy spoke with LNC about his retirement.

Nov. 28, 2017, © Leeham Co.: John Leahy was a salesman at Piper Aircraft, a small general aviation aircraft producer when he received a call from a headhunter to join Airbus North America as its top salesman.

Leahy was head of marketing at Piper. With a pilot’s license, he would take various Piper aircraft to conventions or air shows and on sales calls for demonstration.

“It was great fun,” he said. “It was really an enjoyable job.” Leahy said Piper was consolidating everything in Vero Beach (FL) and he wasn’t sure he wanted to move there. He wanted a more direct sales role and accepted a position with Piper in Geneva, Switzerland, as Director of the Eastern Hemisphere. “I felt that was pretty cool.”

Before moving, the headhunter called.

European experience

“If you want some international experience, before you go live in Europe five or 10 years, you’ll still be an American working for an American company in Europe, that’s

like military guys who go over there and say they lived three years in Europe,” Leahy says the headhunter told him. “They didn’t live in Europe at all. They lived in an American air base,” the headhunter said.

The headhunter said Leahy should work for a European company if he wanted a European experience.

“I thought that sounded intriguing,” Leahy said. The short-term irony, of course, is that he was hired by a European company, Airbus, working in America—initially in New York City at Rockefeller Center and then in Herndon (VA), a distant suburb of Washington (DC).

That was in January 1985. Leahy worked out of Herndon until the summer of 1994, eventually rising to president of Airbus North America, when he and his family transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, as head of commercial for Airbus Worldwide.

Leahy now holds the title of Chief Operating Officer-Commercial.

“I guess I’m an example of the Peter Principal,” he says, with his typical wry humor. “I can’t get promoted above that. I stayed essentially in the job of commercial for 23 years.”

The positions above that are president and COO or CEO of Airbus or of what used to be known as Airbus Group. These positions were traditionally held by French or German nationals until a few years ago when Tom Williams, a UK citizen of Scotland, was named president and COO of Airbus commercial.

One person close to Leahy once quoted him as saying he held the wrong passport (American) as the reason why he wouldn’t become president.

First deal

Leahy’s first deal was selling to Northwest Airlines, which until then had been a solid Boeing customer with a sidetrack to the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 (one of two customers for the Pratt & Whitney-powered DC-10.)

Northwest ordered the A320.

Making the pitch to Northwest presented Leahy with a special challenge, he recalls. No carrier in the US had ordered the A320. Breaking precedent was a problem.

Nobody ever lost their job by buying IBM in data processing, Leahy said. “If you bought Boeing, and it didn’t turn out to be right, well, it was Boeing’s fault,” he recalled three decades later. “If you went out on a limb and bought this crazy European airplane and it didn’t turn out, people’s careers would be over at that point in time.”

The safest bet, he said, was always going with Boeing.

“We had to get that turned around. To a lesser degree, we had the same thing with McDonnell Douglas, which was still around. By the time I came over to Toulouse, Douglas was basically a shadow of itself.”

United win prompted the 737NG

Then Leahy sold the A320 to United Airlines.

“We were probably responsible for the [Boeing] 737NG because a lot of people thought the 737 Classic could outsell the A320,” he said. “At least the guys in Seattle thought that. But when the dyed-in-the-wool, 100% Boeing customer United switched over to the A320, that’s when they panicked and decided they needed to update the 737.”

Boeing offered the 737-400 in the competition. Impartial observers noted that the -400 was slower and shorter-ranged than the A320. Secure in the assumption the Boeing-only operator United wouldn’t stray, the order from Airbus indeed prompted Boeing to redesign the 737 into the Next Generation. The 737-800, the successor to the -400, was given a new wing and 12 more seats than the A320. Generally, it’s agreed that the -800 has a better seat-mile cost than the A320 (before later improvements).

Creative deals

Leahy subsequently sold the A300 to American and Continental airlines.

Selling the A300-600s to American required some innovation. American’s wide-body fleet was principally the DC-10-10/30 and 767-200/ER. Boeing pitched the new 767-300ER against the A300. The CEO, Bob Crandall, was the hard-charging, cost-focused executive at American but the CFO, Jack Pope, and his lieutenant, Gerard Arpey, were tough negotiators.

Pope negotiated walk-away leases for 25 A300-600s, shocking Boeing (and the industry). The deal allowed AA to return the airplanes after a specified period at little or no penalty. Pope then turned around and negotiated walk-aways with Boeing for a similar number of 767-300ERs.

The deals were extremely rare but not unheard of. McDonnell Douglas did five-year walk-aways for American’s first deal for MD-80s, a deal that ultimately led to American buying hundreds of MD-80s.

Before Leahy, Airbus had literally loaned four A300B2 to Eastern Airlines for a test run. This led to an order for what was then a large number of aircraft.

These deals all paid off. American kept the 25 A300s and ordered 10 more.

“It was a pretty cheeky gamble on our part, but we had faith in the airplane. Sure enough, they over the years gave up on the walk-aways. It worked out.”

American also bought a large number of -300ERs.

Pan Am and the revolving A320s

Airbus was willing to make high-risk deals to gain market share. Not all turned out well. One was with Pan Am.

When Leahy came on board Airbus, Pan Am had ordered the A300 and A310 but the contracts weren’t completed. Leahy wrapped these up.

“The 310s probably kept Pan Am alive longer than they would have stayed alive otherwise,” Leahy said. “At least they could fly internationally across the Atlantic with less than half the operating costs of those old 747-100s.”

Pan Am ordered A320s to replace its aging Boeing 727-200s used to feed its New York and Miami hubs, but neared collapse before taking delivery. Leasing company GPA purchased the contract and began leasing the aircraft to Braniff II. Braniff took delivery of about six before it collapsed. Then the contract and aircraft were assigned to America West Airlines.

“I wasted Christmas to New Year’s in [the law offices for Airbus]. We were helping them sell that contract to [lessor] GPA and America West. We got it done at one minute before midnight on New Year’s Eve.”

America West later went through bankruptcy. Airbus provided some exit financing. AWA later acquired US Airways, also an A320/A330 customer, becoming the largest operator of Airbus aircraft in the world. AWA adopted the US Airways name. It later acquired American Airlines, taking American’s name. American by then ordered some 400 A320 family aircraft to replace its aging MD-80s.

So, it all worked out in the end.

One walk-away that walked

One Leahy deal that didn’t turn out well was selling nine A310-300s to Delta Air Lines after Delta acquired the type with its purchase of Pan Am’s European assets, including airplanes. These also had walk-away provisions. Delta exercised them in a massive cost-cutting program under then-CEO Ron Allen during the 1990-91 airline industry disastrous period in which 40% of the US seating capacity was operating under bankruptcy. Delta avoided following other airlines into Chapter 11 then, but those nine A310s Leahy sold Delta were returned in the process. All the Pan Am Airbuses were disposed of.

Delta would never operate another Airbus aircraft until acquiring Northwest in 2010. It wouldn’t place an order for Airbus until 2013 (for the A321ceo.)

Exclusive deals

The reason Delta would buy another Airbus aircraft was a controversial set of deals Boeing struck, first with American, then with Continental, Delta and United.

These were, for the time, unprecedented exclusive supplier contracts to eliminate competition and bind the four airlines to buying airplanes in their categories only from Boeing.

Leahy and Airbus were taken by surprise by the first, the American deal.

“I was actually pissed off by the exclusive deal,” Leahy recalled more than 20 years later. (At the time, this was what might be described as a vast understatement, according to those close to Leahy then.)

“That was probably about the beginning of 1994, or late 1993, right when I was beginning to move over here [Toulouse]. I was in a state of shock. I remember [American Airlines officer Gerard] Arpey called me up and said, ‘John, you better think of something to do. Bob’s sitting there with Ron Woodard, who was running Boeing [Commercial] at the time, and they’re cooking up something that’s going to keep you out of competition until both you and I are long retired.”

(That turned out not to be the case. Both Leahy and Arpey outlived the exclusive supplier agreement at Airbus and American.)

“I said, ‘you must be joking. Why would any company eliminate competition going forward?’” Arpey didn’t have an answer, Leahy said.

“We tried to come in, but at this point, basically I think Boeing came to the conclusion that no matter how painful it was, it was better to give the current management anything they wanted to agree for 20 [Boeing] years [for exclusivity]. Because it might be painful now, but over 20 years, [Boeing] will find a way to get it back. Sure enough, they did.”

Boeing went ahead and signed similar 20-year exclusive deals with United, Delta, Continental and Southwest, Leahy said.

Deal ruled illegal, but honored

The European Union had to review the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas three years later and found the agreements to be illegal. Boeing agreed to abrogate the agreements, but one CEO—Crandall—years later acknowledged he did a side letter agreeing to honor the terms. It’s likely the other airlines did, too.

United didn’t buy an Airbus airplane again until Glenn Tilton was CEO and ordered the A350. Delta stayed true to Boeing until 2013—about 20 years. Continental remained an exclusive Boeing customer and, except for playing with the A350 orders and ultimately upping them to 45, United has remained exclusively Boeing. United is now populated by Continental management, following its acquisition of United.

“We finally broke back into Delta [in 2013],” Leahy said. “I remember we did lose a deal (the A321ceo vs 737-900ER).”

Airbus won the next round for the A321ceo. Delta since reordered the 737-900ER and the A321ceo, buying more than 100 of each. The airline is running a competition between the A321neo and the 737 MAX. A decision is due next month.

"Hawaiian Airlines Welcomes First A321neo, Readies for U.S. West Coast Expansion - Hawaiian Airlines | Newsroom","Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uaGF3YWlpYW5haXJsaW5lcy5jb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtd2VsY29tZXMtZmlyc3QtYTMyMW5lby1yZWFkaWVzLWZvci11LXMtd2VzdC1jb2FzdC1leHBhbnNpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HONOLULU – Hawaiian Airlines today welcomed to Honolulu the first of 18 Airbus A321neo aircraft that will shortly begin flying between Hawai‘i and the U.S. West Coast. The company’s new fleet of single-aisle aircraft will offer guests non-stop flights to more islands, starting with service to Kaua‘i, Maui, and the Kona Coast on the Island of Hawai‘i.

Hawaiian held a blessing ceremony today for its first A321neo, “Maile,” named after a vine native to Hawaii and traditionally used for lei making and celebrations. Fittingly, Hawaiian’s A321neo is adorned with a new livery featuring a silver maile lei wrapping around the fuselage as the carrier’s “Flower of the Sky” Pualani icon gazes forward from the tail of the aircraft.

“Our new A321neos are ideal for our West Coast to Hawai‘i markets. They will bring Hawaiian’s unique blend of Hawaiian hospitality and industry leading operational performance to more travelers than ever,” said Mark Dunkerley, president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “As we welcome our A321neo fleet, some of our wide-body aircraft serving the U.S. West Coast will be deployed for further long-haul expansion.”

Hawaiian’s inaugural A321neo flight is scheduled for Jan. 8 on the carrier’s existing Kahului-Oakland route. New A321neo service between Kahului and Portland will launch on Jan. 18. Hawaiian’s seasonal summer wide-body service currently offered between Līhu‘e and Oakland will resume April 11 as a daily A321neo flight. Daily service between Kona and Los Angeles launches March 11 with wide-body aircraft before converting to the A321neo in the summer. Guests may visit www.hawaiianairlines.com to purchase tickets for all routes operated by Hawaiian Airlines.

The mid-range A321neo aircraft will complement Hawaiian’s fleet of long-haul, twin-aisle aircraft used for service between Hawai‘i and 11 U.S. gateway cities, along with 10 international destinations. The airline’s narrow-body Boeing 717 fleet offers approximately 170 flights between the Hawaiian Islands.

Hawaiian’s A321neos blend unmatched fuel efficiency and comfort.

The 189-passenger aircraft includes 16 luxurious leather recliners in the Premium Cabin, 45 Extra Comfort premium economy seats, and 128 Economy seats. Textiles and other materials throughout the cabin pay homage to traditional Hawaiian crafts such as bark cloth (kapa) and fishing nets. Other details range from sand-inspired wall panels to Hawaiian language signage and LED mood-lighting evoking Hawaii's soothing sunrises and sunsets. Guests will enjoy access to wireless streaming entertainment, USB outlets, and additional overhead stowage space.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney PurePowerr® Geared Turbofan™ (GTF) engines and incorporating the latest in aerodynamics, the A321neo is the quietest and most fuel efficient aircraft in its class, leading to 16 percent lower fuel burn and carbon emissions over previous generation aircraft.

“Airbus aims to further its customers’ goals for passenger and revenue growth, and market penetration by incorporating new technology and design into industry-leading models that deliver both a better passenger experience and economic efficiency,” said John Leahy, Airbus commercial chief operating officer-customers. “For a unique and discerning airline like Hawaiian, the A321neo delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and lower noise and carbon emissions, reducing the environmental impact.”

“We’ve been powering aircraft at Hawaiian since 1929 and we appreciate the continued confidence in Pratt & Whitney,” said Chris Calio, president, commercial engines at Pratt & Whitney. “From the Wasp-powered Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker to the PW4000-powered Boeing 767 to the GTF-powered A321neo, we’re honored to continue the tradition.”

Hawaiian’s A321neo flight deck features next-generation communication, navigation and surveillance avionics – including a completely digital low-range altimeter, and transponders and multi-mode receivers that are fully compliant with future airspace mandates – from Rockwell Collins, a pioneer in innovative aviation solutions.

The aircraft also benefits from the company’s MultiScan™ ThreatTrack weather radar, which alerts flight crews of potentially disruptive weather, allowing for smoother flights and more on-time arrivals.

“We’re committed to keeping our customers and their passengers safe, connected and informed. This is an exciting opportunity to bring that commitment to the Hawaiian Airlines family,” said Jennifer Waterman, director, Air Transport Sales for Rockwell Collins.

Facebook and Airbus Working Together to Advance High Altitude Connectivity - Facebook Engineering,"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZW5naW5lZXJpbmcuZmIuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvMTkvY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5L2ZhY2Vib29rLWFuZC1haXJidXMtd29ya2luZy10b2dldGhlci10by1hZHZhbmNlLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At Facebook, one of the ways we’re helping bring the world closer together is by pioneering new technologies to bring affordable connectivity to more people, faster. This includes our work on the Aquila program, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) broadband connectivity system.

This type of HAPS architecture includes much more than just a fleet of aircraft carrying communications payloads. It will eventually augment terrestrial and satellite networks from approximately 20 km above ground, with minimal infrastructure and maintenance. We believe that HAPS connectivity is an important enabler of the next generation of broadband infrastructure, making it possible to bring broadband connectivity to rural regions where internet connectivity is lacking or non-existent.

Connecting the world in this way will require strong collaboration between companies, organizations, and governments. We’ve been excited to see continued investment by companies in the aerospace industry to deliver connectivity to communities around the world, as well as global regulatory initiatives from aviation and spectrum organizations to enable broadband HAPS commercial services.

To further these efforts, today we announced that we’re collaborating with Airbus to advance spectrum and aviation policy and continue to demonstrate the viability of HAPS systems for providing broadband connectivity.

To be viable, HAPS requires broadband radio spectrum. Radio spectrum is the band of frequencies where radio electomagnetic waves propagate. We have been working with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and governments around the world to make more spectrum available for HAPS, and we are encouraging the ITU to facilitate the necessary spectrum identifications that will support broadband HAPS systems when they meet in November 2019 at the World Radiocommunication Conference. Similarly, we are also encouraging the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and civil aviation authorities around the world to continue their work supporting the integration of HAPS into the worldwide aviation infrastructure.

We’re committed to working closely with industry stakeholders, governments, and regulators to demonstrate how HAPS can accelerate deployment of broadband networks to help connect those without internet access. We look forward to sharing more updates as we work with Airbus to advance the use of high altitude aircraft to help connect the world."
Review: Lufthansa (Airbus A350) Business Class - The Points Guy,"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE3LzExL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1hMzUwLWJ1c2luZXNzLXJldmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

After a pleasant trip from SIN to HEL on Finnair's A350, followed by a fantastic event to celebrate Emirates' 100th A380 at Airbus' delivery center in Hamburg, Germany, it was time to make my way back to the US.

At the moment, I'm focused on trying as many A350s as possible, so Lufthansa's version seemed the next logical fit. Unfortunately the only US route is between Munich (MUC) and Boston (BOS) at this point, so I was looking at a three-segment trip from Hamburg (HAM) home to New York. Given that there was business-class award availability on exactly the flight I needed, and I'd finally get to fly Lufthansa's A350, it seemed worth the extra effort.

Currently, Lufthansa's fleet includes just five Airbus A350s, and eventually that number will grow to 25. For the time being, these planes are all based in Munich, and fly to Boston, Beijing (PEK), Delhi (DEL), Hong Kong (HKG) and Mumbai (BOM). Each plane is named for a different German city — as of now, the fleet includes Nürnberg (registration D-AIXA), Stuttgart (D-AIXB), Saarbrücken (D-AIXC), Bonn (D-AIXD) and Essen (D-AIXE). I flew on Bonn, a three-month-old A350 delivered in mid-August.

We've reviewed Lufthansa's new(ish) business class before, on the Boeing 747-8, and the seats are largely the same here — they're simply not competitive from a comfort and privacy perspective, given that they're arranged in a dense 2-2-2 configuration and many competitors are shifting to 1-2-1 with direct aisle access, as I experienced on Finnair's A350. Still, I had a great flight, as you'll see below, and I certainly wouldn't mind flying this product again.

Booking

Snagging a seat on this flight was entirely straightforward. One-way fares were running over $6,000, so it was clear that an award ticket would be the way to go. I headed right over to United's site and searched for the flights I needed — there was business space both on my A350 segment across the pond, and the connecting flight from Hamburg to Munich.

Ideally, we would have booked using Aeroplan miles, since just 55,000 are required through that program. However, for one reason or another the Aeroplan agents weren't able to see this particular itinerary, so we ended up booking through United MileagePlus, for 70,000 miles plus about $100 in taxes and fees, which we paid with The Platinum Card from American Express to earn 5x points on airfare.

The other issue was that Lufthansa's Boston flight arrives in the evening — 7:30p, at the time of the flight (6:30pm now, since we've switched to Daylight Saving Time.) There weren't any flights to New York in the evening, given that it was a Saturday, so I had no choice but to overnight in Boston. I settled on the Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor, which is near the airport and offers a free shuttle, then I flew home to New York the next morning on a separate United ticket, since the layover time was too long to count as a connection. It was worth the extra hassle and expense for a chance to fly the A350, though.

Airport and Lounge

Munich recently opened a new terminal section, called Terminal 2-Satellite, which comes complete with a brand-new lounge.

My Hamburg flight arrived there, so I headed directly to the new Senator Lounge, which I could access thanks to my Star Alliance Gold status via United 1K. Otherwise I would have ended up in the Business Lounge, which is fairly comparable.

The lounge was very quiet when I arrived a bit after noon, with the exception of the lady seated behind me, who decided to watch YouTube videos using her iPhone's speaker function.

There were plenty of other areas I could have moved to, though, including these odd booth-like seats near the windows.

There was a decent selection of food and beverage items, including soft drinks, beer and liquor.

Food included breads, pretzels, soup, hot items and salads.

The salads looked appealing — if you haven't tried German potato salad, I definitely recommend it.

There were a couple local specialties as well, including a Bavarian pork loaf.

I settled on a Weissbier and a cheese pretzel. Yum!

There was free Wi-Fi, too, of course, and speeds were perfectly sufficient.

After a while in the lounge, I made my way to the US departure gates, which gave me a chance to experience the new ""enhanced screening"" procedure for US-bound flights. As I wrote, I was just waived through once the agent saw my US passport.

We boarded and pushed back more or less on time, around 3:40pm. We were clearly one of the last US-bound flights of the day.

Cabin and Seat

Lufthansa's A350s offer a sizable business-class section, with 48 lie-flat seats spread between two cabins. As you can see from the seat map below, business class starts with Row 1 — there's no first-class section on this plane.

The main cabin has six rows of seats, in a 2-2-2 arrangement.

The forward section felt quite large, and while my cabin had several open seats, the first cabin was nearly full.

I'm glad I opted for the much smaller rear cabin, which has just two rows of seats.

As you can tell, it feels much more private, and since there are only two rows there's much less chance of encountering a particularly disruptive passenger.

There were two lavatories located between the cabins, near the mid galley. There was a third lavatory up front near the cockpit, too, but oddly it was off-limits during our flight — I was told that it's only accessible to passengers when business is entirely full, and since we had a half dozen or so empty seats, it was reserved for the crew.

Otherwise, the cabin was fairly standard for an A350, including those large overhead bins.

There were overhead lights and a fancy digital indicator panel, but unfortunately Lufthansa chose to leave out the overhead vents. Boo! The cabin temperature was perfectly comfortable, though.

I carefully selected seat 8G, which ended up being a phenomenal pick. I've found that agents typically fill the cabin from front to back, and being the last row of business class it seemed likely that foot traffic would be minimized as well.

I ended up really lucking out — 8D, the seat next to mine, was empty, as was 8H across the aisle.

I'm really glad I didn't have a stranger sitting next to me — this seating arrangement isn't particularly private, especially considering this odd footwell.

The bulkhead footwell is far better for sitting next to a stranger, since your feet won't be pointed towards each other. If you'd prefer the footwell below, select a seat in rows 1 or 7.

Storage is fairly limited as well, but I was able to tuck my backpack under the footwell, at least.

Otherwise, there's a small compartment underneath the armrest, but there isn't space for much more than a cellphone and headphones in there.

The seats lie flat, and I found the controls to be straightforward enough. I also liked that you could select the cushion firmness, and I actually noticed a significant difference — I ended up going with the medium-firm setting.

And here you can see 8D in lie-flat mode. The seats are comfortable for sleeping, but there isn't any special bedding on offer — if you're choosing between Lufthansa and its partner United for a transatlantic flight, I'd opt for United if bedding is most important, assuming you don't get stuck on the older 777 with 2-4-2 seats in biz.

On the sleep front, I've heard that Lufthansa's been trying something a bit unique on this route as well, using the A350's LED lighting to help reduce the effects of jet lag. The results have yet to be seen, but it was definitely interesting to watch — I found the deep red to be fairly relaxing, for example.

Overall, I really liked Lufthansa's hard product, despite the dense 2-2-2 arrangement — but as I've mentioned several times, having an empty seat next to me really made all the difference.

Amenities

A few minutes after boarding, I discovered a small compartment to the right of my footwell — it turns out that's where Lufthansa stores a water bottle and the amenity kit.

The amenity kit is branded Samsonite — I don't know about you, but I don't exactly think of Samsonite as being a particularly high-end luggage brand. The contents were fairly basic, but it was a high quality kit overall.

There were also more amenities in the lavatories, including shaving sets, mouthwash, combs and makeup remover pads.

In-Flight Entertainment

There's a large, on-demand in-flight entertainment system mounted at the front of each seat.

I found the picture to be sharp, and the screen was bright and vibrant, especially after I slid it out to the side, which improved the angle a bit.

There's a decent variety of content, including dozens of new releases.

You can control the entertainment system directly on the screen...

...or via the basic wired remote.

I really liked the interactive air show, too — you can choose the view you prefer, rather than waiting for it to cycle through all the options.

The ""overhead view"" option was my favorite, so I set that on 8D's screen and watched movies on my own.

The included noise-canceling headphones were of decent quality, though I still prefer Sony's MDR1000X and the Bose QuietComfort 35. Nobody rushed to collect mine as we began our approach for Boston, though, which I appreciated.

Wi-Fi was available for $19 for the entire flight, and the performance was actually very good. I had no problem staying on top of email and sharing photos from the flight.

Food and Beverage

Having flown Lufthansa's first class a handful of times, I was really looking forward to trying out the business-class catering. I was even more excited once I saw the menu — I came just in time to try Lufthansa's special holiday goose dish!

I was offered a beverage shortly after boarding, and opted for some water and a glass of Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne. Since I was in the very last row, I also asked the flight attendant if she could reserve a goose dish for me, and she said she'd do her best.

That was it for a while, though — the next round of drinks didn't arrive until an hour and 20 minutes after takeoff, when I also received my pick of appetizer, the venison pie, which I very much enjoyed.

Next was a lamb's lettuce salad with potato dressing, which came out 20 minutes later — simple but delicious.

And I lucked out! The flight attendant was able to hold a roast goose for me, which was served 10 minutes after the salad, alongside red cabbage and potato dumplings. It was quite the treat.

Finally, about two hours after takeoff I had my pick of cheese, fruit and ice cream for dessert. I went with the cheese and fruit.

The cheeses included a sheep's cheese with rosemary, Gouda, Montagnolo and a soft cheese with apricot ginger chutney. All were fantastic.

After the meal was complete there was a small self-service beverage station in the galley, with orange juice, apple juice and water.

Then, exactly 90 minutes before landing a flight attendant came by with a pre-arrival meal of a lamb's lettuce salad with ham, potato, tomatoes and cheese, served alongside a lemongrass soup, with a chocolate cherry cake for dessert. All were delicious. I also requested a pretzel and an Erdinger beer.

Overall Impression

I was very pleasantly surprised by this flight. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I hadn't heard the best things about Lufthansa's new business-class seats — and rightfully so; with a 2-2-2 configuration they're hardly competitive.

The crew, catering and plane really made this flight outstanding, though, along with the fact that 8D stayed empty — if there had been a surly stranger sitting there I'm sure I would have walked away with an entirely different impression. Based on this experience, I'd happily fly Lufthansa's A350 business class again."
Landing on Everest: Didier Delsalle Recalls his Record Flight - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2xhbmRpbmctZXZlcmVzdC1kaWRpZXItZGVsc2FsbGUtcmVjYWxscy1yZWNvcmQtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: Vertical recently visited Nepal to report on that country’s civil helicopter industry, which you can read more about in a future issue of the magazine. In the meantime, we’ve teamed up with Airbus Helicopters to bring you exclusive bonus content from Nepal, here and on social media. Find more at verticalmag.com/nepal and on Instagram @verticalmag and @airbus_helicopters.

It’s no exaggeration to say that the development of the Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) AS350 B3 changed the landscape of helicopter operations in Nepal. Powerful enough to land and take off at previously inaccessible altitudes in the Himalayas, while retaining the versatility and economy that have made the AS350 series a bestseller, the B3 quickly became the most popular civil helicopter in Nepal. Today, that market is dominated by its successor, the AS350 B3e (now called the H125).

Given the importance of the model to operations in the High Himalayas, it’s fitting that the AS350 B3 proved its chops by touching down on the highest peak of them all: Sagarmāthā, better known outside of Nepal as Mount Everest.

“The idea was to prove to our customers all the margins they have while they’re using the helicopter in the normal certified envelope, compared to what the helicopter is capable of during the flight test,” explained Airbus Helicopters test pilot Didier Delsalle, who made the record-setting flight in a stripped-down production aircraft on May 14, 2005. With the AS350 B3 certified to a maximum operating altitude of 23,000 feet, it was clear that taking off from Mount Everest’s 29,029-foot (8,848-meter) summit would demonstrate a healthy safety margin.

While the achievement made international headlines at the time, you may not know the story behind it, particularly if you’ve joined the helicopter industry in the past 12 years. So we asked Delsalle to go back in time to 2005 and explain how his famous flight came together.

Decades in the Making

Delsalle started by going even further back in time, to 1972. That’s when legendary French aviator Jean Boulet, piloting an Aérospatiale SA 315 Lama, set the world record for the highest altitude flight in a helicopter at 12,442 m (40,820 ft). According to Delsalle, the achievement planted the seed of an idea that would only be realized three decades later.

“At the time, he thought about landing on Everest. But the company was not too keen to do that, and the type of helicopter was quite sensitive to power variations at high altitude [due] to the way the engine was governed,” Delsalle explained. “So it was not the helicopter to fly in the very turbulent environment at high altitude.”

Two years later, in 1974, Aérospatiale conducted the maiden flight of the first AS350 prototype. Over the next 30 years, the AS350 Écureuil or “Squirrel” — known in North America as the “AStar” — evolved through successively more powerful variants. In the early 2000s, Delsalle was assigned as a test pilot for the most powerful version yet, the AS350 B3, when it occurred to him that he might have found a helicopter with the potential to land on Everest.

“It was a kind of personal feeling with my flight test engineer at the time, Bernard Certain, that we had the capability to do that,” he recalled. “That was not planned at all at the time, but little by little the idea came in…”

Aérospatiale had by that point merged into Eurocopter, and the company initially discouraged the idea. But in 2004, when a new software version of the Turbomeca (now Safran Helicopter Engines) Arriel 2 engine performed better than expected, Delsalle broached the subject again. “I went back to the company and said we have to do that, we have the capability, and I will prove to you by some local tests here around the south of France that we have the capability to do that with an acceptable level of safety,” he said.

Those local tests started in April 2004 with an experimental flight up to 8,992 m (29,500 ft). They continued for a year, culminating in April 2005 with another experimental flight up to 10,211 m (33,500 ft), plus “time to climb” records to heights of 3,000, 6,000 and 9,000 m. Meanwhile, Delsalle was also busy organizing the logistics and clearances for his trip to Nepal, which “was quite difficult,” he said.

From Southern France to Eastern Nepal

By April 2005, Delsalle and his team of four mechanics and a ground engineer were ready. The helicopter was flown from France via cargo plane to New Delhi, India, where they reassembled it for the flight to Nepal. However, they narrowly escaped disaster when a sandstorm nearly destroyed the hangar they were working in. According to Delsalle, “it was only by chance that the helicopter had not been damaged. It was on the very first day we arrived, and we had been very lucky not to be hurt ourselves.”

Delsalle arrived with the aircraft in Kathmandu around the first of May, where he said his first step was to confirm his clearances with Nepal’s civil aviation authority. (This became a point of contention after the fact, when Nepal initially denied that Delsalle had secured appropriate permissions for the flight, and also that he had landed on Everest at all. Eurocopter would express regret for the “misunderstanding,” but stood by Delsalle, whose achievement was eventually certified by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, or FAI.)

From Kathmandu, Delsalle repositioned to Lukla, the remote mountain airport that is the jumping-off point for Everest climbers and trekkers. There, Delsalle and his team worked to prepare the helicopter for the record attempt — with a brief diversion to rescue two Japanese trekkers who were suffering from medical issues. Delsalle also began conducting recce flights to determine the best way of approaching the summit, quickly discovering that the path to the top wasn’t a simple one.

“On one side of the mountain, on the updraft side, I wasn’t able to approach the mountain because even taking out all of the power of the aircraft, I was still climbing,” he recalled. “But of course on the other side you had the downdraft side, and on this side even with maybe 60 knots on the airspeed indicator I was going backward . . . and the helicopter at full power was not powerful enough to counteract that.”

For Delsalle, making his way to the summit meant navigating the fine line between Everest’s updrafts and downdrafts. With the engine’s governing system operating outside its certified flight envelope, it was particularly essential that he find a path that would allow him to fly smoothly, without abrupt collective inputs. He made several approaches to the summit during his recce flights, but did not attempt a touchdown, “because I had felt that it was not the right time, the right feeling,” he recalled. “You have to of course be very comfortable in this kind of thing, and in fact you have to let the mountain accept you.”

Delsalle was also cognizant of the hazards that his rotor wash might pose to any climbers beneath him. In fact, his record-setting flight was timed to take advantage of a time period when there were no climbers near the summit.

“I had been lucky, and the climbers unlucky, because we had two days of bad weather, and all of the climbers had to go down because it was very, very bad weather,” he explained. “So just after the thunderstorm [passed], as soon as the summit was clear on the 14th of May, I tried my chance to go there, and I succeeded.”

On Top of the World

Delsalle recalled that the landing was a tricky one, due to the 65-knot winds and the lack of visual references.

“When you reach the summit you reach the updraft point, and of course the updraft winds have enough force to throw you away as soon as you put the collective down,” he said. “I had to stick my skids on the summit and push into the mountain to stay on the summit. Another big problem there is that you have no visual of the summit, and you have no specific cues, because you are on the highest point. You are in free air in fact, and you have to try to find where is the summit exactly.”

Not only that, Delsalle had his windows open to keep the windshield from icing up with the humidity of his breath (a problem that had plagued Boulet in 1972). The temperature was -35 C, and because Delsalle doesn’t like to fly with bulky flight suits, he was wearing only two layers of thermal undergarments, plus his flight suit. “But you know, in these conditions, you forget the cold,” he laughed. “You are so hot inside your mind, the cold is nothing.”

Touching skids was the hard part. Delsalle had no trouble when the time came to depart from the summit after 3 minutes and 50 seconds, nearly double the 2-minute skids-on-ground time required by FAI. After investing so much effort in reducing the weight of the aircraft — and even his own weight through dieting — Delsalle actually found that the helicopter was lighter than he would have preferred in the windy conditions. “It was very easy to take off,” he said. “I had just to pull a little bit on the collective and I went to flying very easily.”

Delsalle was understandably elated by his successful mission. But his mood changed when he returned to Lukla and downloaded what should have been the recording of his flight, necessary for proving his accomplishment to FAI.

“We had some very bad news, because when I checked on my computer . . . there were no recordings,” he said. “I remember I got a very bad temper at the time and I decided tomorrow morning I had to go again, before the climbers. In fact I went again on the 15th and I did it a second time.”

This time, the recording equipment worked. (In fact, it was later determined that the apparent absence of recordings from the first flight had been a software glitch, and the data from that flight was eventually recovered.)

Recognizing His Limits

Delsalle said he wouldn’t hesitate to make the flight again, as he was fully comfortable with the safety margins of the aircraft and the way in which the flight was conducted. “It was not crazy, everything was planned, and we had a good tool to do that, because the AS350 B3 is really a very powerful aircraft,” he said.

However, he came away from Nepal with a greater respect for Everest and the inherent challenges of flying helicopters on the highest mountain on Earth. Delsalle had been motivated, in part, by a desire to expand rescue capabilities for Everest climbers, hundreds of whom have died in their attempts to summit. He was not entirely disappointed in this hope, as in recent years an impressive number of Everest rescues have been conducted by AS350 B3 and H125 helicopters.

“But there are some limits, that was one of the conclusions of this mission,” Delsalle said, pointing out that Everest’s extreme winds and weather conditions make some rescues unacceptably risky, if not outright impossible. “Because in fact is it worth it to risk the life of a pilot and co-pilot to maybe rescue one [person] at such altitudes? Sometimes maybe it’s too dangerous, and you have to accept that it may not be possible.”"

The three companies together announced the groundbreaking collaboration, bringing together some of the world’s foremost experts in electrical and propulsion technologies, at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London.

The E-Fan X hybrid-electric technology demonstrator is anticipated to fly in 2020 following a comprehensive ground test campaign, provisionally on a BAe 146 flying testbed, with one of the aircraft’s four gas turbine engines replaced by a two megawatt electric motor. Provisions will be made to replace a second gas turbine with an electric motor once system maturity has been proven.

“The E-Fan X is an important next step in our goal of making electric flight a reality in the foreseeable future. The lessons we learned from a long history of electric flight demonstrators, starting with the Cri-Cri, including the e-Genius, E-Star, and culminating most recently with the E-Fan 1.2, as well as the fruits of the E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration with Siemens, will pave the way to a hybrid single-aisle commercial aircraft that is safe, efficient, and cost-effective,” said Paul Eremenko, Airbus’ Chief Technology Officer. “We see hybrid-electric propulsion as a compelling technology for the future of aviation.”

The E-Fan X demonstrator will explore the challenges of high-power propulsion systems, such as thermal effects, electric thrust management, altitude and dynamic effects on electric systems and electromagnetic compatibility issues. The objective is to push and mature the technology, performance, safety and reliability enabling quick progress on the hybrid electric technology. The programme also aims at establishing the requirements for future certification of electrically powered aircraft while training a new generation of designers and engineers to bring hybrid-electric commercial aircraft one step closer to reality.

As part of the E-Fan X programme, Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Siemens will each contribute with their extensive experience and know-how in their respective fields of expertise:

- Airbus will be responsible for overall integration as well as the control architecture of the hybrid-electric propulsion system and batteries, and its integration with flight controls.



- Rolls-Royce will be responsible for the turbo-shaft engine, two megawatt generator, and power electronics. Along with Airbus, Rolls-Royce will also work on the fan adaptation to the existing nacelle and the Siemens electric motor.

- Siemens will deliver the two megawatt electric motors and their power electronic control unit, as well as the inverter, DC/DC converter, and power distribution system. This comes on top of the E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration between Airbus and Siemens, launched in 2016, which aims at development and maturation of various electric propulsion system components and their terrestrial demonstraion across various power classes.

Paul Stein, Rolls-Royce, Chief Technology Officer, said: “The E-Fan X enables us to build on our wealth of electrical expertise to revolutionise flight and welcome in the third generation of aviation. This is an exciting time for us as this technological advancement will result in Rolls-Royce creating the world’s most powerful flying generator.

“Siemens has been driving innovation in core technology fields at full speed,” said Roland Busch, Chief Technology Officer of Siemens. “In April 2016 we opened a new chapter in electric-mobility with the collaboration with Airbus. Building up electric propulsion for aircraft, we are creating new perspectives for our company and also for our customers and society. With the E-Fan X partnership, we now take the next step to demonstrate the technology in the air.”"

November 28, 2017, ©. Leeham Co: Eric Schulz, President of the Civil Aerospace division at Rolls-Royce, has been appointed as the successor of John Leahy, COO-Customers, at Airbus.

Schulz will join Airbus as EVP, Head of Sales, Marketing & Contracts for the Commercial Aircraft business end of January 2018.

Leahy, also called Mr. Airbus by his customers, is retiring after having sold 16,000 aircraft over 33 years at Airbus. Leahy will stay on until early spring 2018 to help the transition to Schulz.

Schulz has been heading Civil Aerospace at Rolls-Royce since January 2016. He joined Rolls Royce in February 2010 as Chief Operating Officer of Gas Turbine Services and ran the Civil Large engines business from 2013.

I met Schulz at the Airbus A330neo first flight a month ago, where he headed the Rolls-Royce group. He is a very approachable and I got a good impression after only 10 minutes of discussion, while waiting for the A330neo to taxi in after its first flight.

Schulz is of French origin but speaks perfect English after 10 years in the US. He worked as president for EADS’ and Northrop Grumman’s EADS Aeroframe company (who successfully sold the Airbus A330 for the US Air Force tanker program, which was overturned on appeal by Boeing) and then president of Goodrich Actuation Systems until joining Rolls-Royce in 2010.

Schulz is now going full circle, as his first job after Masters Degrees at the Ecole d’Ingenieurs of Geneva and ESTA Engineering and Technology School (Paris), was at Airbus (then Aerospatiale).

Airbus to sell 430 planes to Phoenix private equity firm Indigo for $49.5 billion - USA TODAY,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLzIwMTcvMTEvMTUvYWlyYnVzLXNlbGwtcGxhbmVzLWluZGlnby84NjUzOTYwMDEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to sell 430 planes to Phoenix private equity firm Indigo for $49.5 billion

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Airbus signed a $49.5 billion deal on Wednesday to sell 430 airplanes to the Phoenix-based private equity firm that owns Frontier Airlines, striking the European aerospace company’s biggest deal ever at the Dubai Air Show.

Meanwhile, Boeing reached an agreement with low-cost carrier FlyDubai to sell 225 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft — a deal valued at $27 billion. The developments came ahead of the biennial air show closing on Thursday.

The Airbus deal with Indigo Partners will see 273 A320neos and 157 A321neos split up among Denver-based Frontier, JetSMART of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and Wizz Air of Hungary, all ultra-low-cost airlines associated with Indigo.

More: For airlines, two engines are better than four

The surprise announcement comes after Airbus on Sunday suffered the embarrassment of believing it had struck a major deal with the state-owned carrier Emirates to sell its A380 double-decker jumbo jet, only to see Boeing sit on the podium with the airline and sign a $15.1 billion deal.

“Just to clarify: This is not an A380 press conference,” joked John Leahy, Airbus’ sales chief, as the start of the announcement.

A320neos list for $108.4 million apiece and A321neos at $127 million. Airlines and manufacturers negotiate lower prices for big deals like these, something Indigo’s managing partner Bill Franke was quick to stress afterward speaking to journalists.

“Here’s hoping,” he said. “Their objective is to sell aircraft at the best possible and our objective is to buy aircraft at the best possible price. I’ve known Mr. Leahy for 25 years. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I win.”

Asked if he won, Franke said: “That’ll be a good question.”

Airbus’ previous biggest-ever sale came in August 2015, when it sold 250 A320neos to Indian budget airline IndiGo, a deal estimated to be worth $26 billion at list prices. IndiGo and Indigo Partners are separate firms with separate management.

Franke is a pioneer of the cheap tickets and high fees airline business that has spread overseas and is growing in the United States. Such carriers offer low base fares but adds fees to stow a carry-on bag, get an assigned seat and other extras. That’s led to soaring customer complaints against Frontier.

Franke was previously the chairman and chief executive of America West, which was acquired by U.S. Airways in 2005.

President Donald Trump also came up in Franke’s conversation with journalists on Thursday, as Franke said the American leader would be happy to know the A321neos purchased by Indigo would undergo final assembly in the Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Shortly after, FlyDubai and Boeing announced their $27 billion deal. FlyDubai said the planes would bring the low-cost carriers total fleet up to 320. FlyDubai has begun to code-share flights with Emirates; both airlines are owned by Dubai’s government.

Until Wednesday, the only major deal announced at the Dubai Air Show came on Sunday, when long-haul carrier Emirates purchased 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners in a $15.1 billion deal.

Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has pinned hopes of continuing production of its A380 double-decker jumbo jet on Emirates, the world’s largest operator of the aircraft. Reports circulated before the air show that a major A380 sale would be coming.

Airbus employees even filled a news conference on Sunday, expecting the A380 sale, instead to find state-owned Emirates making the deal with Boeing in front of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Emirates now relies solely on the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 777 for its flights, making it the largest operator of both. It has 165 Boeing 777s in its fleet today and took possession of its 100th A380 earlier this month.

The Emirates’ snub even came up at the news conference Wednesday, when a reporter asked Airbus if another deal could be coming.

“I think you’ve got to walk over to the chalet with Emirates on the door and ask them,” Airbus’ Leahy said.

Analyst: Airbus could eventually terminate CSeries program - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 07 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMS8wNy9hbmFseXN0LWFpcmJ1cy1jb3VsZC1ldmVudHVhbGx5LXRlcm1pbmF0ZS1jc2VyaWVzLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nov. 7, 2017, © Leeham Co.: The Bombardier CSeries may go the way of the McDonnell Douglas MD-95, a Wall Street aerospace analyst suggests: that is, the program is likely to remain unprofitable and be shut down.

Doug Harned, the analyst for Bernstein Research, draws a parallel between Airbus’ acquisition of a majority stake in the CSeries program and Boeing’s 1997 acquisition of McDonnell Douglas in which the MD-95 joined the Boeing family of airplanes.

The 110-seat MD-95 was renamed the Boeing 717. Boeing attempted to market the airplane, without success. Production was terminated after 156 airplanes were built.

Good airplane, no future

Harned acknowledged the 717 was a good aircraft. It remains in high demand on the used aircraft market. But it was an orphan—just one model was produced—and had no commonality with the larger Boeing 737 family.

Boeing was unable to reduce costs because suppliers, facing a low-production future, were unwilling to cut costs, Harned said.

He believes Airbus faces similar challenges with the CSeries.

Likely to remain unprofitable

Harned believes the CSeries, although in two models vs the one for the 717, will remain unprofitable, eventually leading to a decision by Airbus to shut the program down. (It should be noted that Bombardier has the right to repurchase Airbus’ shares.)

He believes that like Boeing, Airbus won’t be able to cut costs because suppliers already see a difficult path to profits.

Harned believes the CSeries needs to sell for about $30m to be profitable. Airlines want prices in the low $20m range, he said.

Harned also cast doubt on the current skyline quality (something LNC has noted many times), with the prospect of cancellations.

An unidentified European customer last week signed an LOI for 31 firm and 30 option CSeries. This contract is to be firmed up by year-end, Bombardier said.

Eliminating a competitor

Harned sees the Airbus deal as a mechanism to eliminate a competitor and benefit from learning from the advanced technology in the airplane. But even at a $30m sales prices, this will account for only about 2% of sales, he projects, an inconsequential revenue producer for Airbus.

The market demand is a matter of debate.

Bombardier forecasts a demand of 6,800 aircraft in the 100-150 seat sector the CSeries serves. In 2014, the last year Airbus identified the demand for this sector in its 20-year forecast, Airbus projected a demand of just over 4,100 aircraft.

Boeing hasn’t publicly projected a demand in the 100-150 seat sector, but in a research note issued today by Cowen & Co., Cai von Rumohr cites a Boeing forecast of 3,000-4,500.

The Airbus-Bombardier deal is expected to close in 2H2018. Airbus plans to assemble the airplane in Mobile (AL), supplementing the current Montreal assembly line.

Airbus develops world's first Mixed Reality Trainer for A350 XWB - Airbus,"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMS1haXJidXMtZGV2ZWxvcHMtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LW1peGVkLXJlYWxpdHktdHJhaW5lci1mb3ItYTM1MC14d2LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and JAL cooperate and explore benefits of mixed reality technologies for mechanics and crew training for aircraft operations

Airbus, in cooperation with Japan Airlines (JAL) and JAL Engineering (JALEC), has developed a prototype application supporting new training solutions, taking advantage of the world’s most advanced Mixed Reality technology, Microsoft “HoloLens” and immersive headsets. This will enable the airline community to benefit from cost-effective and highly enhanced training and operational solutions, pushing the boundaries of what is currently available.

HoloLens and immersive headsets provide access to aircraft digital data which can be viewed from any angle to run specific aircraft procedures, virtually.

This innovative technology brings key business value as users can learn from anywhere, without the need of the physical aircraft, via a holographic coach or an interactive, shared 3D virtual system.

“Aircraft manufacturer Airbus and airline operator JAL have cooperated together and combined high expertise from the both sides on this innovation, making a step forward into a new training era. The success of this cooperation will set new standards in terms of training for the industry,” said Yuji Akasaka, Managing Executive Officer, Engineering & Maintenance, President of JAL Engineering.

Stéphane Ginoux, President of Airbus Japan, “We believe this technology, developed in cooperation with JAL and JAL Engineering, will bring significant value across our business. It will change fundamentally the way people interact with our data and work process.”

Airbus recently became one of the rare industrial players to be a member of the Microsoft Mixed Reality Partner Program. As such, Airbus expertise in Mixed Reality is not only recognised but certified by Microsoft, meaning the company can build and exploit Mixed Reality on behalf of Microsoft.

In 2013 JAL signed a purchase agreement for 31 A350 XWBs (18 A350-900s and 13 A350-1000s), plus options for a further 25 aircraft. The delivery of the first A350 XWB to the airline is scheduled in 2019. Airbus plans to offer “HoloLens” for some selected training scenarios to airlines in the world including JAL on the introduction of the A350 XWB."

Work is starting on the first A380 “six-year” C-check for a third-party customer airline at Airbus’ and Etihad Airways Engineering’s joint A380 MRO Services offering in Abu Dhabi. The aircraft, A380 MSN072 belonging to Lufthansa, arrived at the end of October, and following an initial inspection phase, is getting ready to undergo the heavy check at Etihad’s state-of-the-art heavy maintenance facility. The extensive work scope, which includes major structural checks and incorporation of the mandatory Service Bulletins, is supported by an onsite Airbus technical advisory team.

First agreed last year, this joint services collaboration materializes Etihad Airways Engineering’s recently announced membership of the international “Airbus MRO Alliance”, while for airlines it establishes OEM-backed third-party A380 maintenance, engineering and embodiment capabilities in Abu Dhabi, delivering efficient turnkey solutions under one roof. During the actual heavy maintenance visit, Airbus Customer Services provides technical advisory, logistical support and planning optimisation managed by a dedicated on-site expert team, allowing minimised downtime of the aircraft.

Latest A321neo build standard with “Airbus Cabin-Flex”, 97t MTOW option and long-range capability nears rollout

Final assembly of the first A321neo, which combines “Airbus Cabin Flex” (ACF) with a new 97 metric tonne MTOW (Maximum Take Off Weight) capability and an option for additional fuel capacity, is underway at Airbus’ facilities in Hamburg. This variant introduces new door and fuselage enhancements, which when coupled with the new higher take-off weight, allows airlines to either increase maximum capacity to 240 passengers for their intra-regional high-density missions, or allows installation of an additional (third) underfloor fuel tank for up to 4,000nm intercontinental range with around 206 passengers.

The most visible changes compared with the previous A321 variant are the ACF-related enhancements. These include: the removal of the door just ahead of the wing (known as “Door-2”); the addition of new upward-swinging double emergency over-wing exit doors (ie four in total); and the moving further back by four frames of the door just aft of the wing (known as “Door-3” on previous A321s). One pair of the over-wing doors and the relocated “Door-3” (now further aft of the wing) can be activated or de-activated depending on the respective layout and seating density. Moreover, the deletion of Door-2 facilitates for the first time an uninterrupted seating zone spanning the entire forward half of the aircraft, thus enabling variable business class sizes without degrading layout efficiency.

In addition to these cabin features on the main deck, the A321 “ACF” model also brings more flexibility in the ‘underfloor’ cargo area where a third “Auxiliary Centre Tank” (ACT) can now be installed. Previously, the A321 offered the provision for up to two ACTs the size of a cargo container. Combined with the increased MTOW of 97 metric tonnes, the third ACT adds a further 400 nautical miles of range making this variant of the A321neo the longest range single-aisle airliner in production known as the A321LR. Airlines will thus be able to make long-haul flights up to 4,000 nautical miles with 206 passengers. The A321neo ACF is an option for now, but will become the default build standard for all A321neos from 2020. Following final assembly, the aircraft will make its first flight in the coming months, with first delivery expected for Q2 2018. As for the A321LR, the first delivery is scheduled for Q4 2018.

First BelugaXL takes shape in Toulouse

Work on assembling the first BelugaXL large transporter is progressing well, and attachment of its main cargo door is set to commence in mid-November. Recently received parts for the aircraft's specially designed tail section which have been installed on the aircraft include the horizontal tailplane (HTP), the tail cone and the vertical tailplane (VTP). Airbus has also launched the electrical and mechanical systems installation for the whole fuselage, in readiness for electrical power-on at the end of the year and subsequent ground tests early in 2018. Integration work will start soon on the second aircraft.

The first BelugaXL is scheduled to fly in Q3 2018, ahead of a 10-month flight test certification campaign and will enter service with Airbus Transport International (ATI) in 2019. Aircraft ‘number one’ is the only aircraft which will take part in this campaign and so it is being equipped with a ‘full’ flight-test instrumentation (FTI).

The project was launched in November 2014 to address Airbus’ future ramp-up capacity requirements. Derived from the freighter version of Airbus’ A330-200, the BelugaXL is six metres longer, one metre wider and has a payload lifting capacity six tonnes greater than the current Beluga A300-600ST. When operational, the fleet of five BelugaXLs will take over transporting complete sections of Airbus aircraft among the company’s production sites around Europe and to final assembly lines in France, Germany and Spain.

Certification of A320neo SHort AiRfield Package (SHARP) by Brazil’s aviation authority – ANAC – paves way for service entry

The recent certification received from the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) for Airbus’ SHort AiRfield Package (SHARP), paves the way for the start of operations with Avianca Brasil and Azul Airlines in the very near future. SHARP is a unique combination of aerodynamic, flight control, braking and software modifications improving both the take-off and landing capabilities of A320neos operating in complex airports. SHARP will bring new efficiencies to Brazilian airlines operating in Rio de Janeiro’s Santos Dumont Airport (SDU), allowing them to maximize their capacity and profitability. ANAC’s certification award joins other leading aviation authorities which certified SHARP – namely the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – in July 2017. Azul, followed shortly thereafter by Avianca Brasil, selected SHARP for their growing A320neo fleets and are the first two customers worldwide to opt for the solution package.

SHARP is a result of a close collaboration between Airbus, its customers and engine manufacturers (CFM and Pratt & Whitney) to enhance payload capabilities for airlines which operate in complex airports while also bringing a sustainable and competitive advantage for their A320neo fleets. The key components of the package are a Kevlar composite panel modification to the wing’s ‘Root Fillet Fairing’ to enable the improved landing performance and vortex generators attached to the vertical tail plane improving take-off performance.

Mobile USA FAL receives its 50th A320 Family shipset

Airbus’ US final assembly line (FAL) in Mobile, Alabama, recently received its 50th shipset of A320 Family subassemblies. These components will become the 50th Airbus aircraft produced in the US – an A321 for Delta Air Lines to be delivered in December. The Mobile FAL received the component for its first aircraft in June 2015. At the time of writing, in November, the facility had delivered 43 aircraft to four customers and had reached a production rate of four per month. In other recent news, in October, AirAsia took delivery of the first A320neo to be assembled at the Airbus Final Assembly Line Asia (FALA) in Tianjin, China. Today Airbus has A320 Family FALs located in four countries: Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China; and Mobile in the US.

A350 goes digital for parts traceability

The A350 programme has become the first to introduce digital Auto-ID / RFID* part marking for flyable components in production. Auto-ID part-marking will soon supersede traditional paper-based traceability means in all A350 plants and the final assembly line (FAL). Going forward, as parts are fitted to an aircraft, installation will be confirmed with an electronic scanner. Accurate aircraft parts traceability is necessary for assuring Airbus product quality and regulatory compliance, which has historically been managed manually using thousands of parts ID slips – one for each part fitted. The introduction of digital Auto-ID for flyables ensures better quality data and represents significant cost savings thanks to accelerated traceability tasks and total paper trail elimination on a large scale. Airbus’ other aircraft programmes will adopt the new approach in due course, with traceability automation becoming a reality for the A380 before year end, followed by the A320 and A330 in 2018.

* RFID = “Radio Frequency ID”

New competency-based pilot training now available for customers

A new ‘Type Rating’ pilot training course prioritising pilot competence acquisition is now available for the A320 and A330 programmes following its approval by the EASA ahead of schedule. This competency-based training approach, which had been previously introduced on the A350, incorporates all Airbus’ latest manufacturer recommendations. It focuses on the following principles: development and assessment of fundamental pilots' competencies (competency-based teaching, grading & assessment); reinforcement of basic flying skills through new training modules; explanation of the underlying behaviours required for successful execution (instead of focusing on the outcome of events or exercises); and increased practice time, with the manual handling of the Full Flight Simulator (FFS) being introduced earlier.

Included are the new ‘Intermediate’ optional modules, available for the A320 and A330. These allow for an adapted curriculum with the opportunity to refresh or reinforce the fundamental skills and competencies expected for a pilot: Instrument Rating reinforcement; Multi-Engine exposure; Jet orientation course; and Multi-Crew Cockpit cooperation. Meanwhile, the Type Rating modules (eg. the ‘Advanced’ modules) provide the student with a smooth transition from basic flight environment to a complex flight environment.

Sichuan Airlines signs A350 XWB Flight Hour Services (FHS) components support and AiRTHM agreement with Airbus

Sichuan Airlines, an all-Airbus-fleet airline based in Chengdu, has selected Airbus Flight Hour Services (FHS) and Airbus Real Time Health Monitoring Service (AiRTHM) to provide components and predictive maintenance support securing the highest service level and operations for its new fleet of four A350 XWBs. Sichuan Airlines is to operate the A350 XWBs in the coming months on its international routes including Chengdu to the US. This long-term FHS-Components and AiRTHM agreement provides an extensive scope of A350 line replaceable units (LRUs) and APU, guaranteed spare parts availability through pool access service and on-site stock at the customer’s main base, as well as component reliability management and maintenance. In addition, AiRTHM brings a proactive maintenance mode to A350 operations. With this latest agreement, Airbus FHS has now been selected to cover more than 400 aircraft, ranging from the A320, A330, A380 to the A350 XWB.

ST Aerospace and Airbus strengthen collaboration with airframe MRO agreements

ST Aerospace (STA) and Airbus have entered into General Terms Agreements (GTAs) for the provision of airframe heavy maintenance and modification services by STA to Airbus and its customers. With these GTAs, which have an effective period for three years, Airbus will benefit from greater access to STA’s strong Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) capabilities at four of its facilities specialising in airframe maintenance across the Asia and North America region to support in-service requirements of its customers’ fleets. STA has a long history and wide experience in servicing Airbus aircraft, which will be valuable in meeting Airbus’ need for a strong partner with a global network to support the rapidly growing Airbus fleet around the world.

China Airlines becomes an Airbus approved supplier for MRO services and aircraft conversion services

Following an in-depth Airbus evaluation process earlier this year, China Airlines (Taiwan) has been approved and qualified as a supplier for MRO services and aircraft conversion services. The centre will be based in Taipei. This qualification, which will help China Airlines to develop its MRO centre for heavy maintenance capabilities and modification embodiment, follows the launch of a joint development project with Airbus on the Internet of things (IOT) applied to MRO services. China Airlines also recently became part of Airbus’ MRO Alliance – which was announced in June at the Paris Air Show."
Airbus Helicopters terminates H120 program - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRlcm1pbmF0ZXMtaDEyMC1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Citing a dichotomy between the lower end of the light single market and a “high added value” in its product on the segment, Airbus has decided to terminate the H120 (nee EC120 Colibri) program.

Deliveries had been stagnating at a very low level for years. In 2016, five H120s were handed over, compared to 63 Robinson R66s. The turbine derivative of the R44 is much more affordable, especially for owner-pilots. But Airbus had, for years, been excluding the R66 and the H120 from its calculation when it worked out its market share for civil rotorcraft.

“We want to position ourselves on the highest added-value [products], . . . we are going to walk away from the lower end of the market where you see turbine helicopters derived from piston-engine helicopters; we are not playing on in this segment, it is a commodity market,” CEO Guillaume Faury said. The H120 is not longer on Airbus’ catalog but “we will keep supporting it,” he promised.

The smaller the helicopter, the least the added technological value is interesting for the customer, David Prevor, head of marketing, explained. For example, an airframe that enables fitting a hoist induces an extra weight. It makes more sense on the H125 and the H130, the other two light singles in Airbus’ range. Light singles account for only 17 percent of the market in value and, with the H120, “we are talking about the lower end of that segment,” Prevor added. “Our helicopters are too sophisticated for that market.”

The last H120 was delivered in October from Airbus’ factory in Marignane, France. There, it used the same final assembly line as the H125 and the H130.

With a 36-strong fleet, the largest operator of the H120 is Helidax. A civil company, it provides helicopter training to French Army pilots. The Dax, southwest France venture is a subsidiary of Babcock MCS and DCI."

As part of Air Côte d'Ivoire’s corporate social responsibility policy, this mission will support the education and health sector – areas in great need in the region.

The aircraft took off from Toulouse on 25 November carrying 3 tonnes of goods, donated by Aviation Sans Frontières, to Air Côte d'Ivoire’s home base in Abidjan. The relief items will be distributed to the three NGOs Health Alliance, Children of Africa and SOS Village d’enfants d’Abobo.



“We are honoured to be working with Aviation Sans Frontières and the Airbus Foundation to perform this humanitarian flight,” said René Décurey, General Director Air Côte d’Ivoire. “The acceptance of our latest A320 is made more meaningful as we transport humanitarian goods to children in need. At the same time, this highlights the essential role that aviation plays in addressing humanitarian emergencies and supporting relief operations.”

“Whenever possible with our customers, we try to use delivery flights of new aircraft to ship humanitarian donations to countries or regions in need,” said Fabrice Brégier, President Airbus Commercial Aircraft and member of the Airbus Foundation’s Board of Directors. “I welcome Air Côte d'Ivoire to our network of partners and thank the airline as well as Aviation Sans Frontières for their logistics support and tireless efforts to make this mission a reality.”

Boeing versus Airbus: Who won the battle of Dubai? - CNBC,"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvMTcvYm9laW5nLW9yLWFpcmJ1cy13aG8td29uLXRoZS1iYXR0bGUtb2YtZHViYWkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380 jet airliner (top), a Boeing 777 jet airliner (L), and the Al Fursan aerobatic team in flight at the 2017 Dubai Airshow.

Airshows are traditionally an opportunity for the big aircraft manufacturers to seal the deal on long order negotiations with airlines and leasing companies. The likes of Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer will look to defeat each other in the smaller-sized jet market, but the headline battle in commercial aviation is conducted between Europe's Airbus and the U.S.' Boeing. The Dubai Airshow 2017 was no different as the big two looked to outdo each other for new business. Leading into the show, Boeing held a healthy lead over Airbus for orders in 2017, accounting for an estimated 65 percent of new order value. But could the firm stretch that lead or did Airbus manage a fight back in Dubai?

The U.S. manufacturer stunned observers with an opening day order from Emirates for 40 787-10 Dreamliners. The current list price for the deal is $15.1 billion. Emirates will receive the medium twin-aisle plane from 2022. Azerbaijan Airlines then placed a new order for five earlier models of the same aircraft, the 787-8 Dreamliner. Along with a provisional commitment to buy two large freighters, the deal added another $1.9 billion to Boeing's order book. Following that, Ethiopian Airlines doubled a previous commitment to Boeing and will now buy four 777 freighters. The list price for that deal was $1.3 billion. Ethiopian currently has 30 of Boeing's 737 MAX planes on order as it looks to take advantage of rapid aviation growth in Africa.

Boeing saved its best until the second last day of the airshow, however. It signed an agreement with budget carrier flydubai for 225 737 MAX planes, holding a list price of $27 billion. Boeing said the deal represents the largest-ever single-aisle jet order, by both value and number of aircraft, from any Middle East carrier. On the last day of the airshow, Boeing signed a final purchase agreement with Kazakhstan's SCAT Airlines for the purchase of six Boeing 737 MAX 8s. That deal is valued at $674 million. SCAT Airlines also has an opportunity baked into the deal that allows it to purchase another five aircraft at a later date.

Airbus was heavily tipped to announce an Emirates order for 30 new A380 planes on day one of the airshow. The deal never happened and Emirates President Tim Clark offered an indication why, when he explained that Airbus needed to commit to the superjumbo program for at least 10 years. It wasn't until day three of the show that Airbus announced a commercial order. Golden Falcon Aviation signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for 25 of Airbus's popular A320neo aircraft. Although the contract value was not unveiled, the list price for one A320neo is approximately $108 million, giving a total order of $2.7 billion. The planes will be used by Kuwait's resurrected Wataniya Airlines. Then came the big one. Airbus turned its fortunes around with a mammoth order of 430 jets from the A320 family, worth a list price total of $49.5 billion. The buyer, who will seek financing for the deal, was U.S. private equity firm Indigo Partners. Signing the deal for Indigo was veteran airline investor Bill Franke, who described it as the largest aircraft order ever.

Airbus Helicopters ramping up H175 production - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXJhbXBpbmctaDE3NS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is, at last, ramping up the production of the H175 super medium twin to levels the company had been planning before the offshore oil-and-gas downturn hit in 2013 to 2014.

Eleven examples of the H175 will be delivered this year, according to program director Marc Allongue. Next year, the production rate is to increase to 14 or 15. The full capacity, 30, is expected to be reached in 2020.

In June 2014, six months before the entry into service of the H175, Airbus was planning on 18 deliveries in 2015. The plan had to be drastically altered. In March this year, only 12 H175s were in service.

But the program is gaining momentum. The 20th aircraft has just been delivered and is to enter service soon. A total of 100 aircraft have been ordered and the main customer, Belgium-based NHV, is operating 10. The average availability in the in-service fleet has been measured at “more than 80 percent,” Allongue said.

The H175 meets the needs of the offshore oil-and-gas industry in terms of safety and comfort, according to Airbus Helicopters chief executive officer Guillaume Faury. In addition to NHV, two major offshore operators — Babcock and CHC — have the type in their fleet. Some own the aircraft, while some lease them from companies like Milestone Aviation. Seventeen H175s have been delivered for oil-and-gas offshore operations.

The sector has not recovered but it still needs helicopters. David Prevor, Airbus Helicopters’ head of marketing, also noted a softening in the trend to automate oil rigs. Over the past five years, 40 to 50 percent of the new rigs were automated, at a significant investment.

Another factor in the current success of the program has been orders — three — from the VIP sector. One H175 flies to and from a 480-foot super-yacht.

Finally, parapublic missions have been the source of more sales, to Thailand and Hong Kong, for instance. The “Public Services” variant is being developed for its first customer, Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service. “Technical acceptance” is scheduled for late this year and the first delivery is to take place in the middle of next year.

The H175 is a 50/50 joint development with China’s Avicopter. Although the program started in 2005 and the first flight took place in 2009, the quality of the Chinese components — such as the tail boom — still has to be carefully monitored. Some 20 Airbus Helicopters employees are with their counterparts at Avicopter’s factories in Harbin and Changsha. They help with both H175 production and development of the Chinese version, the AC352.

The 18-passenger version is in development, targeting a mid-2018 entry into service. In addition to the interior layout, emergency evacuation procedures have to be reworked and life rafts have to be adapted.

On the final assembly line in Marignane, southeast France, ongoing improvements include reducing the production cycle to 15 weeks, from 52."

Introduction

Nov. 6, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Boeing took a pass on assuming ownership of the Bombardier CSeries, according to a report in the Toronto Globe and Mail—the same deal rival Airbus took.

In doing so, Boeing passed on acquiring a new airplane program at pretty much zero risk, no cash investment and no research-and-development cost. The market demand ranges from 4,000 to 6,000, depending on whose study you believe.

Rival Airbus wouldn’t have a response and, given its current turmoil, would have been unlikely to pursue a response.

Instead, Boeing may embark on a risky, high-cost development of the New Midrange Aircraft for which market demand remains a controversy, suppliers are reluctant to take risk-sharing positions and which will almost certainly provoke a response from Airbus.

Airbus A350-1000 receives EASA and FAA Type Certification - Airbus,"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLXJlY2VpdmVzLWVhc2EtYW5kLWZhYS10eXBlLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft on target to first customer delivery by year end

Following an intensive flight test campaign performed in less than a year, the A350-1000 has received Type Certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The certified aircraft is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

The EASA A350-1000 Type Certification document was signed by EASA’s Certification Director, Trévor Woods, and the FAA A350-1000 Type Certification document was signed by FAA’s International Section Manager, Bob Breneman. Both certificates were handed over to Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering, Charles Champion.

“Receiving the A350-1000 Type Certification from EASA and FAA less than one year after its first flight is an incredible achievement for Airbus and for all our partners who have been instrumental in building and testing this superb widebody aircraft,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus COO and President Commercial Aircraft. “The A350-1000 benefits from the maturity of its successful brother, the A350-900, which has translated into excellent right-on-time performance. We now look forward to deliver the first aircraft to Qatar Airways by the end of the year.”

The Type certification is a requirement for the aircraft to enter commercial service. This milestone comes after an intensive flight test trials that have taken its airframe and systems beyond their design limits to ensure the aircraft successfully meets all airworthiness criteria. The three A350-1000 flight test aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce engines successfully accumulated over 1,600 flight hours. Of these 150 flight test hours were completed with the same aircraft in an airline like operational environment to demonstrate its readiness for entry into service.

The A350-1000 is the latest member of Airbus’ leading widebody family, showing high level of commonality with the A350-900 with 95% common systems part numbers and Same Type Rating. As well as having a longer fuselage to accommodate 40 more passengers than the A350-900 (in a typical 3-class configuration), the A350-1000 also features a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. Along with the A350-900, the A350-1000 is shaping the future of air travel by offering unprecedented levels of efficiency and unrivalled comfort in its ‘Airspace’ cabin. With its additional capacity the A350-1000 is perfectly tailored for some of the busiest long-haul routes. To date 11 customers from five continents have ordered a total of 169 A350-1000s.

"Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens develops Hybrid-Electric demonstrator - Leeham News and Analysis","Wed, 29 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMS8yOS9haXJidXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2Utc2llbWVucy1kZXZlbG9wcy1oeWJyaWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

November 29, 2017, © Leeham Co.: Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens yesterday announced they will fly a hybrid-electric demonstrator by 2020, E-Fan X (Figure 1).

The aircraft, a BAe 146 four engine regional jet, will have one if its turbofans replaced by a Rolls-Royce/Siemens electric fan propulsor. The demonstrator is part of a technology program exploring the challenges around electric flight.

E-Fan X goals.

The E-Fan X program will fly a electric propulsor that is 30 times larger than Airbus’ first demonstrator, the E-Fan, which crossed the English channel in 2015 (Figure 2). The program brings the electric flight components into the domain where they can fit a regional airliner.

But it’s early days, showed by Airbus’ answer when I poked a bit deeper into the battery technology:

We have not yet designed the amount of energy storage we will put on board. There are many challenges which we expect to encounter during this project. Some of the key challenges we have are around the electromagnetic interference generated by a 2MW system, the end-to-end thermal management required on the electric motor, power electronics, the generator/gas turbine combination, and, of course, some electrical characteristics like corona effect and partial discharge.

The demonstrator programme will be investigating the best solutions, sometimes testing them in advance on the ground, and ultimately proving them in flight. The aim of the E-FAN X demonstrator is to pull the technology and pull the solutions which in some cases we don’t already have today. This is a change in the way we do research at Airbus and we expect it to accelerate technology development compared to the traditional approach.

This is refreshing. Instead of working on perfecting all these challenges in the labs, the trio puts together a flying demonstrator to try things out and learn.

The demonstrator

The platform for the demonstrator is the only four-engine regional jet, the BAe 146. The starboard inboard 7klbf thrust Lycoming ALF502 turbofan is replaced with a 7klbf thrust Rolls-Royce AE3007 turbofan/nacelle, Figure 3.

The inboard AE3007 powerplant has its core replaced with a 2MW Siemens electric motor + inverter. Siemens also designs the 3kV DC power distribution system.

In the back of the fuselage, Rolls-Royce installs the core of the AE3007, now as the turboshaft AE2100. The Liberty T406 for the tilt-rotor V22 Osprey is the cores’ origin. The AE2100 turboshaft (Advanced Hercules) and AE3007 turbofan (Citation X, ERJ-145) are derivatives from the Osprey core. The air inlet for the AE2100 turboshaft on the demonstrator is visible in Figure 1 behind the wing.

The AE2100 is mated to a Rolls-Royce-designed 2.5MW generator with control electronics. This feeds the 3kV DC distribution system through its AC/DC converter.

Complementing the system is an Airbus supplied battery system. It occupies the forward and aft cargo holds and weighs two tonnes. It can deliver 2MW power by means of its DC/DC converter to the distribution network/propulsor; how long is not finally decided (and by it its kWh energy sizing).

The whole system is controlled and supervised by an Airbus-supplied E-supervisor system and cockpit monitors.

Technology level

The Siemens motor and Rolls-Royce generator are non-superconducting (non-cryogenically cooled) designs. This means the power chain “AE2100 turbine to AE3007 fan” has efficiency losses above 15%.

There are enough challenges to master for such a demonstrator before chasing the last percent of efficiency losses would be our conclusion. Here are the challenges the partners have:

For Siemens to design a light 2MW motor is a first, with a Power/Mass ratio “significantly” higher than the Paris Air Show Extra330 demonstrator’s motor of 5.2 kW/kg. To this shall be fed by a 2MW DC/AC inverter and a low loss 3kV DC distribution network, which can work in the thin air of 20,000-25,000ft.

Rolls-Royce has experience of integrated gasturbine-generators but in industrial and naval applications. This is a first for a flying unit. As is the needed AC/DC converter in the 2.5MW class.

For Airbus, the 2MW power class of the system and batteries is a 30 times step up from the E-Fan. As Airbus said in the response above there are a multitude of challenges that must be researched and mastered. The 2MW E-Fan X project is an important stepping-stone towards electric airliners, Figure 4.

Finally, EASA, the European airworthiness authority, will take part in the program to develop certification criteria for electric airliners. Without adapted certification rules, electric flight will not take-off.

Airbus seals record $50bn deal with Indigo Partners for 430 planes | The Independent - The Independent,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXJlY29yZC1kZWFsLWluZGlnby1wYXJ0bmVycy00MzAtcGxhbmVzLWEzMjAtYXZpYXRpb24tbWFudWZhY3R1cmVycy1hODA1NTYzNi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Airbus announced the biggest commercial-plane deal in its history, securing an order valued at nearly $50bn (£37bn) for 430 planes from its single-aisle A320neo line.

The pact with US investor Indigo Partners gives Airbus the upper hand at the Dubai Air Show, where it has been trailing Boeing in orders. It’s also a crowning achievement for Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who is set to retire after a multi-decade career in which he has struck deals for thousands of jets and lifted the European planemaker into a duopoly position with its rival.

For Indigo Partners, led by Bill Franke, the Airbus accord provides upgraded narrow-body aircraft to boost the fleets of low-cost carriers from Denver to Budapest. The planes will go to four companies in Indigo’s investment portfolio: Frontier Airlines, Mexico’s Volaris, European operator Wizz Air and upstart JetSmart, which began operating this year in Chile.

The deal features 273 A320neo jets together with 157 of the larger A321neo variant and is worth $49.5bn before customary discounts, Airbus said. Leahy, 67, called the transaction “remarkable”, while Franke, 80, who co-founded Indigo in 2002, said it underscores his confidence in the A320 and the bargain fares, no-frills travel model he helped develop.

More to come?

Even with the massive haul from Indigo, Airbus may not be done at the Dubai event. Other mooted orders may still materialise on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter have said, including an accord with EgyptAir Airlines for A320neos and one with discount carrier FlyDubai. The latter is weighing an order for as many as 175 narrow-body planes that could be split between the A321neo and Boeing’s 737 Max.

The Indigo deal more than doubles Airbus’s previous order book for the year, which stood at about 290 aircraft as of 31 October, pushes the planemaker’s backlog above 7,000 jets and reverses expectations that orders will trail deliveries in 2017.

The haul will also help Airbus catch up to Boeing in the order tally this year, with the European planemaker having chalked up 343 contracts at the end of last month, compared with 690 for its Chicago-based rival as of 7 November. The order also trumps a 2015 deal for 250 single-aisle jets worth $27bn by Indian budget carrier IndiGo. The two companies aren’t related.

The massive A320 win takes the sting out of a possible defeat on the A380 superjumbo, which has so far failed to clinch a follow-up deal with local carrier Emirates at the Dubai show. The companies have been in talks on a deal for about 36 additional double-deckers valued at $15.7bn, people familiar with the negotiations have said.

The A380 has become all but a fringe product for Airbus, with a total order book of 317 -- more than 100 short of the A320s that Indigo plans to buy.

The breakdown of the Indigo order is as follows:

Wizz -- 146 planes (72 A320neo, 74 A321neo)

Frontier -- 134 planes (100 A320neo, 34 A321neo)

Volaris -- 80 planes (46 A320neo, 34 A321neo)

JetSmart -- 70 planes (56 A320neo, 14 A321neo)

The purchase provides a boost to Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who has found himself on the defensive amid an investigation into bribery allegations at the company. Mr Enders has warned employees that the probe is likely to be a drawn-out process that could result in “serious consequences” and “significant penalties”.

A German who has run Airbus for five years, Mr Enders orchestrated another coup last month when he struck a deal with Bombardier to take a majority stake in the Canadian company’s C Series jet programme. That will give Airbus access to advanced technology while throwing Bombardier a lifeline for its slow-selling aircraft.

Fly-by-Wire Pioneer

The A320 is Airbus’s best-selling product and the aircraft that put the company on the map when it was introduced in the late 1980s with cutting-edge technology such as fly-by-wire controls and a side-stick to steer the plane rather than Boeing’s central yoke.

Airbus was first to pioneer the new-engine variant of its existing single-body model. The A320neo first flew in 2014 and has been delivered to customers around the world. Boeing’s response, the 737 Max, only entered commercial service this year.

Narrow-body aircraft, which typically seat six abreast in economy class, are the workhorses of the global airline fleet. Burgeoning demand for air travel will push jetliner sales to more than 34,000 worldwide in the next 20 years, according to Airbus’s 2017 global market forecast. Almost three-quarters of that will be single-aisle models, the company said.

While a huge commercial hit, the A320neo hasn’t been without technical faults. Output is being disrupted by manufacturing delays at Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, which supplies the plane’s geared turbofan engine. The A320neo is also powered by engines made by CFM International, a venture between General Electric and Safran.

Airbus makes the A320 family at different sites around the world, including its main factory in Toulouse, France, as well as in Hamburg, Germany. The company also builds the plane at an assembly line in China, and has recently pushed into the US with a plant in Mobile, Alabama.

The deal is for 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners valued at $15.1bn at current list prices.

Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman of Emirates, said the aircraft had been chosen over the Airbus A350.

The 787-10 is the largest member of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner family and more than 65 customers have ordered more than 1,275 Dreamliners to date.

“Emirates' orders today will be delivered from 2022, taking the airline well into the 2030s,” Sheikh Ahmed said. “Some of these will be replacements so that we maintain a young and efficient fleet, and others will power our future network growth.

“We see the 787 as a great complement to our 777 and A380 fleet, providing us with more flexibility to serve a range of destinations as we develop our global route network.”

Emirates is the world's largest Boeing 777 operator and will be the first to receive the new 777X in 2020. It said the 787-10 would complement the 777 fleet.

The order is a further kick in the teeth for Airbus as the carrier had been expected to announce a big order for the Airbus A380 superjumbo at the media briefing.

Speaking to CNBC Emirates' chief executive Tim Clark said he wouldn't rule out buying more Airbus A380s in future, but stressed the airline needs assurances that Airbus won’t cancel the A380 programme.

“The ownership, my bosses here, will not sanction any further acquisitions unless they know the line is going to be continued and they have a full understanding of what would happen if there was a cancellation,"" he told the news organisation.

Airbus has not won a new A380 order from any airline for more than two years and does not expect any for the rest of this year. In July, the manufacturer revealed that production would fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and just eight in 2019.

In addition to the Emirates order, Boeing has also landed a deal with Azerbaijan Airlines for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters. The agreement is valued at about $1.9bn at current list prices.

The orcers come as Boeing has forecast that airlines in the Middle East will need 3,350 new airplanes over the next 20 years, valued at an estimated $730bn. Twin-aisle airplanes are expected to make up nearly 50 percent of the orders.

""Traffic growth in the Middle East is expected to grow at 5.6 percent annually during the next 20 years,"" said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

""The fact that 85 percent of the world's population lives within an eight-hour flight of the Arabian Gulf, coupled with robust business models and investment in infrastructure, allows carriers in the Middle East to channel traffic through their hubs and offer one-stop service between many cities.""

Airbus partners with Rolls-Royce and Siemens to build an electric airplane - Electrek,"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAxNy8xMS8yOC9haXJidXMtcGFydG5lcnMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2Utc2llbWVucy1idWlsZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1wbGFuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Battery technology improvements are expected to soon enable electric flight and companies in the field are preparing their powertrain technology to support it.

In a major move toward that goal, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens have announced a new partnership to gradually convert a plane to electric propulsion.

The project they are collaborating on is the ‘E-Fan X’, a BAe 146 plane on which they are testing their electric motor technology.

During ground tests, they already replaced one of the four gas turbines by a two-megawatt electric motor.

Paul Eremenko, Airbus’s CTO, commented on the project:

“The E-Fan X is an important next step in our goal of making electric flight a reality in the foreseeable future. The lessons we learned from a long history of electric flight demonstrators, starting with the Cri-Cri, including the e-Genius, E-Star, and culminating most recently with the E-Fan 1.2, as well as the fruits of the E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration with Siemens, will pave the way to a hybrid single-aisle commercial aircraft that is safe, efficient, and cost-effective. We see hybrid-electric propulsion as a compelling technology for the future of aviation.”

Once they better test and understand the first electric motor, they will replace a gas turbine with another one and batteries will support takeoff and climbing.

Here are the roles of each member of the new partnership:

Airbus will be responsible for overall integration as well as the control architecture of the hybrid-electric propulsion system and batteries, and its integration with flight controls.

Rolls-Royce will be responsible for the turbo-shaft engine, two megawatt generator, and power electronics. Along with Airbus, Rolls-Royce will also work on the fan adaptation to the existing nacelle and the Siemens electric motor.

Siemens will deliver the two megawatt electric motors and their power electronic control unit, as well as the inverter, AC/DC converter, and power distribution system. This comes on top of the E-Aircraft Systems House collaboration between Airbus and Siemens, launched in 2016, which aims at development and maturation of various electric propulsion system components and their terrestrial demonstration across various power classes.

Electrek’s Take

In terms of commercial aircraft, this is likely the biggest electrification effort to date.

Both Siemens and Airbus have separately produced all-electric aircraft, but those were much smaller planes. Airbus’ E-Fan was the first electric plane to successfully fly across the English Channel and Siemens’ electric plane set new records for a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph) and first electric aerotow.

But this new effort is for a larger commercial aircraft.

Those are not likely to go electric until some major improvements in energy density for batteries, but it looks like they are focusing on electric motors and controls to be ready when batteries do catch up."

The announcement came at the Dubai Air Show and the deal includes 273 A320neos and 157 A321neos. The airlines that use the aircraft will include Frontier Airlines, JetSMART of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and Wizz Air of Hungary.

A320neos list for $108.4 million apiece and A321neos at $127 million. Airlines and manufacturers often negotiate lower prices for big deals like these.

Airbus lands £38bn deal for record 430 budget airline planes - The Guardian,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L25vdi8xNS9haXJidXMtZGVhbC1wbGFuZXMtZHViYWktYWlyc2hvdy1ib2VpbmfSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNy9ub3YvMTUvYWlyYnVzLWRlYWwtcGxhbmVzLWR1YmFpLWFpcnNob3ctYm9laW5n?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has landed the aerospace industry’s biggest-ever deal by number of planes, with an agreement to sell 430 jets worth up to $50bn (£38bn) to budget airlines.

The preliminary deal for A320neo narrowbody jets was signed at the Dubai airshow on Wednesday and offers a major boost to Airbus, which has lagged its rival Boeing in deals this year.

But Boeing immediately hit back with a provisional agreement to sell 175 planes to the budget airline flydubai. Including options to buy a further 50 planes, that deal could be worth $27bn at list prices.

The deal between Airbus and US budget airline investor Bill Franke’s Indigo Partners is the industry’s largest ever by number of aircraft.

Indigo plans to supply the A320neo narrowbody jets to four airlines in which it has stakes: US carrier Frontier Airlines, Mexico’s Volaris, Chilean carrier JetSmart and Hungary’s Wizz Air.

Airbus said it expected to finalise the transaction with the 80-year-old Franke in the coming weeks. Its shares were up by 2.5% to €85.59 at midday on Wednesday.

The agreement, along with flydubai’s deal for Boeing’s 737 Max narrowbody jets, underscores how budget carriers are rewriting the industry rulebook by combining bargain fares with optional services and upgrades for which passengers pay extra.

According to some delegates at the air show, the deals also suggest airlines are taking advantage of a recent slowdown in demand for new jets to negotiate competitive prices.

This year Airbus’s share of the global plane order market had dropped to 35% prior to the Dubai show, as a rejuvenated Boeing management made advances in Singapore and elsewhere.



Airbus management is also dealing with investigations by British, French and US authorities after the company uncovered inaccuracies in sales documents.

Altiscope: building blueprints for the sky - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTExLWFsdGlzY29wZS1idWlsZGluZy1ibHVlcHJpbnRzLWZvci10aGUtc2t50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A³, Airbus’ Silicon Valley innovation outpost, has launched Altiscope, a project to help define air traffic management (ATM) in a way that will allow the different types of flying vehicles to share airspace safely and efficiently.

By 2030, air traffic will increase more than tenfold as autonomous aircraft join existing traffic in the skies, according to Airbus’ internal estimates¹. Low-altitude delivery drones, autonomous urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, high-altitude conventional planes, helicopters and other aircraft could all be in use above us. But in order for this to happen, decision-makers need tools to understand their regional airspace.

Altiscope is building a simulator to evaluate ATM policy options and operational models that can enable all forms of airborne traffic in a wide range of geographies and jurisdictions. In collaboration with partners around the world, Altiscope is safely enabling new uses of our airspace through deep analysis, policy simulation, and decision-modelling.

Developing safe and effective airspaces

One of the newest members of the team, former technologist at the Peace Innovation Lab at Stanford, Jessie Mooberry is the head of deployment for Altiscope. In this role, she works with global partners to build tight feedback loops and deploy products that support the mission of creating safe, effective airspaces. Mooberry says the A³ team is already working on discrete projects with a variety of global organisations across the public and private sector with engagements like risk modelling and operational analysis.

“For example, we might evaluate how urban air mobility vehicles, cargo drones, and commercial aircraft interact in the vicinity of shipping and logistics hubs. Our airspace is complex, and ensuring safety is at the forefront of regulators, operators, and manufacturers alike. Enabling missions like Vahana, CityAirbus, and Skyways will require quantitative and data-driven rulemaking demonstrating how these new missions will integrate safely into the airspace,” she says.

A new approach

Karthik Balakrishnan, who heads Altiscope, says that with the backing of Airbus and its worldwide resources, the project is being developed in an open ecosystem using a small internal team to partner with the best minds around the world. The bottom line is that current air traffic management systems are not equipped to manage that traffic, meaning that a fundamentally new approach is required.

“Creating the new order of the sky isn’t a new question and there are many parties working to solve the complexities of this pressing challenge. Altiscope brings a unique perspective to the table,” says Balakrishnan. “To start, we aren’t building an ATM system and we aren’t beholden to a specific policy, product or geography. Rather, Altiscope’s unique simulation framework is policy agnostic and globally relevant.”



“What exactly does that mean?” he continues. “Other ATM efforts are making tremendous strides in this space, typically focused on a given set of operation and mission goals. On the other hand, we are focused on evaluating different options for the new rules of the air and aren’t specifically tied to any particular ATM architecture. We aim to create a framework that accounts for any type of aircraft operation, system, aircraft platform, geography, and mission profile — without prioritising one kind over another.”

Successful future airborne traffic management depends on a solution that is both flexible and scalable as-yet-unimagined applications are developed and take flight."
Is the Airbus A380 On Its Last Legs? - Popular Mechanics,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMTM3MzI3MDgvaXMtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLW9uLWl0cy1sYXN0LWxlZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The era of the A380 might be coming to an end. The double-deck, widebody, four-engine commercial plane has been a standard for luxury since it first started flying in 2005 but flying it makes less and less financial sense. At a recent trade show in Dubai, even the plane's main backers have shown caution in committing to the plane.

""The A380, I'll be honest with you, has not been a wildly successful aircraft given that [Emirates] is the main operator of the plane,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian tells Business Insider in an interview. ""Most operators of the A380 I've talked to are not thrilled with the performance of the A380 given the cost.""



The A380 was predicted to determine the future of commercial flying. At the time of its maiden flight in 2005 from Toulouse, France, where Airbus is headquartered, Aviation Week quoted a local remarking that ""this is the first time, since Concorde's first flight in early 1969, that a commercial transport generated such a tremendous interest."" An industry forecast at the time predicted that ""if the A380 lives up to its promises in terms of improving airline profits and attracting passengers due to its space, comfort and services—the so-called “WOW” factor—then many other airlines may be obliged to respond or suffer the economic consequences.""

Hailed by then-French President Jacques Chirac as a ""European success,"" heads of state from Germany and England came to pay homage at an opening ceremony. Later, the World Trade Organization would rule that the European Union's $13 billion subsidization of the A380 was illegal.

Seating 555, more than the Boeing 747, the A380 was supposed to usher in an era of affordable superjumbo flight. While problems with wiring in production and the plane's unusually quiet atmosphere emerged by 2008, the plane began to sell.

Luxury airlines like Emirates took to to the A380 in large part due to the freedom it gave to them to experiment by creating high-end lounges and shower spas. Emirates quickly emerged as the main buyer of the plane. Of the 317 firm orders made on A380s, Emirates has made 240, slightly more than three-fourths of all purchases. But this week, Emirates announced a surprise purchase of 40 787-10 airplanes from Boeing, which seat a mere 320 passengers. The planes will be deployed on shorter regional routes that don't require the A380's size and can't bear its operating cost.

This will all take place several years from now—the Boeings won't enter the Emirates fleet until 2022. While Emirates is ""concerned"" about future production of the A380, President Tim Clark, speaking at the Dubai trade show, said that ""I don't believe that [commitment] would be difficult for Airbus to deliver."" He also noted that Emirates has a backlog of 42 A380 orders, which will see the continuation of the plane to the ""middle of next decade"".

""If it's an Emirates order that sustains the line, so be it.""

Update: An Airbus spokesperson has responded with the following comment:

“The A380 is here to stay. We continue to invest in its future and bring new innovations to the aircraft for present and future customers. Air traffic doubles every 15 years, and 90% of long-haul passengers pass through 60 hubs, the majority of which are congested. The A380 remains the best solution to unlock growth at congested airports, and at the same time continues to offer the highest comfort level in all classes to its passengers.”"

Airbus is looking to develop autonomous aircraft and technologies that will allow a single pilot to operate commercial jetliners, helping cut costs for carriers, chief technology officer Paul Eremenko said.

“The more disruptive approach is to say maybe we can reduce the crew needs for our future aircraft,” Mr Eremenko told Bloomberg Television. “We’re pursuing single-pilot operation as a potential option and a lot of the technologies needed to make that happen has also put us on the path towards unpiloted operation.”

The aerospace industry has begun seeing a similar trend as the car market, where car makers are investing in or acquiring autonomous driving startups. Plane manufacturers including Airbus and Boeing are racing to develop artificial intelligence that will one day enable computers to fly planes without human beings at the controls.

Turning that idea into a practical reality won’t be easy in an industry where at least two pilots in the cockpit have been the norm for commercial flights for several decades. After a Germanwings pilot flew an A320 plane into the French Alps in March 2015, killing all 150 people on board, many airlines around the world made at least two people in the cockpit mandatory at all times.

In addition to there being no transport-category aircraft certificated for a single pilot or pilotless flight, it’s unclear whether passengers or their insurers or carriers would accept or permit it, said aviation consultant Robert Mann, a former American Airlines executive.

“People are arguably apprehensive about these kind of things,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “You have driverless cars, driverless buses, but for something that flies, that’s something different.”

Airbus has a division called Urban Air Mobility that is exploring technology from on-demand helicopter rides to delivery drones. Boeing said last month it purchased a company that is developing flying taxis for Uber and also bought into a hybrid-electric airplane company.

Last week, Airbus agreed to set up an innovation centre in China’s Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. The facility will help accelerate research needed to chart the future of air travel, and China will provide Airbus an opportunity to design and develop such technologies, Mr Eremenko said.

Take a Leap

“I think the general aviation space in China is just opening up,” Eremenko said in Hong Kong. “There’s an opportunity for China to sort of take a leap ahead as it has been prone to do in other areas and design the aerospace system, design the regulatory regime to be future looking, forward looking to enable urban air mobility.”

The Toulouse-based company is also exploring technologies that will bring more automation to the cockpit of planes that could help resolve shortage of pilots in countries like China, which is set to emerge as the world’s biggest aviation market in less than a decade. Discussions are on with Chinese companies such as Baidu to find ways to apply self-driving vehicles to the aviation industry, Mr Eremenko said.

Boeing estimates that 637,000 pilots will be needed to fly commercial aircraft globally in the next two decades. The industry needs to find ways to produce more cockpit crew as only 200,000 pilots have been trained since the start of the aviation industry, Mr Eremenko said.

Airbus’s A3 Silicon Valley think tank has been working on its proposed Vahana flying taxi, due for its first test before the end of this year. The pilotless, electric-powered vehicle could be hailed like a conventional cab, but won’t get stuck in traffic jams. The single-person flying machine could slash journey times for city dwellers over a range of 50 miles, according to Airbus.

Of the 317 A380 superjumbos that Airbus has sold in the 15 years since it began building the massive aircraft, one airline — Emirates — has bought nearly half.

The airline, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, operates 100 A380s — a double-decker aircraft that can carry as many as 800 passengers on long flights — while no other airline owns more than 19.

So when Emirates opened the 2017 Dubai Air Show this week with a blockbuster $15.1 billion order for 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners — a sleeker, more efficient aircraft made by Airbus's rival — it was a massive surprise. In fact, as Bloomberg News reporters at the show noted, Airbus was expected to announce a deal of that very size for the A380.

Even though Emirates' president, Sir Tim Clark, told CNBC on Monday that the company hadn't ruled out buying more A380s in the future, the reason he gave for going with the Boeing aircraft was particularly troubling. Emirates won't order any more A380s, he said, until Airbus can firmly commit to not canceling the superjumbo.

Clark's concern may become a self-fulfilling prophecy for Airbus.

For most other planes, Airbus could firm up its order books and stabilize the program by fishing for sales elsewhere.

But it can't do that with the A380. At this point, Emirates isn't just the plane's most important customer — it is effectively the plane's only customer. And that means what happened in Dubai this week could mark the end of the giant aircraft.

Airbus was not immediately available for comment.

It was going to revolutionize air travel

A rendering of Emirates' new Boeing 787-10. Emirates

When Airbus unveiled the A380 in the mid-2000s, it was supposed to revolutionize air travel.

It was to usher in a new era of luxury and comfort, with the economics to make airlines happy. We were dazzled by visions of flying casinos and stylish in-flight lounges. And the sheer magnitude of the aircraft is awe-inspiring.

Even though the casino never materialized, the A380 has certainly delivered on the luxury and comfort it promised.

But for airlines, the airplane hasn't quite delivered the financial returns operators sought — especially when compared with cheaper, more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets like the Boeing 787 and 777, and even the Airbus A350.

Is the end really here?

The plane billed as the second coming of the Boeing 747 is really no more than a niche product. The 747 itself is on life support, with production rates slowed to one plane every two months.

These days, the bulk of long-haul flying is done by twin-engine wide-bodies. The big four-engine jets are relegated to special high-density routes.

""The A380 still has a role on airports that have slot restrictions"" — where you can't add a second flight — ""or where the scheduling windows work"" for a single flight, like out of Los Angeles, Joyce said.

That means the only thing that can save the superjumbo is airport congestion.

It's the same argument Clark has made in support of the plane.

""Airport congestion around the world is getting worse,"" Clark told Business Insider in 2016. ""And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this.""

Clark and Emirates may still order another tranche of A380s. The airline likes to keep its average fleet age at about six years, and some of its older superjumbos are approaching the 10-year mark. And updating the A380 could be pricey. For instance, Singapore Airlines is spending $850 million for new interiors in its 19 A380s. It may be more economically prudent to order new planes.

Whether that will be enough to save the A380 remains to be seen."

Dubai, 15 November 2017 – Airbus and Indigo Partners’ four portfolio airlines have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase by the four airlines of 430 additional A320neo Family aircraft. The aircraft will be allocated among the ultra low-cost airlines Frontier Airlines (United States), JetSMART (Chile), Volaris (Mexico) and Wizz Air (Hungary) upon the completion of final purchase agreements between Airbus and the four airlines.

The 430-aircraft commitment, comprised of 273 A320neos and 157 A321neos worth $49.5 billion at list prices, was announced at the Dubai Airshow by Bill Franke, Managing Partner of Indigo Partners, and John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. When added to existing Airbus A320 Family orders, the new agreement will make Indigo Partners one of the largest customers by order number in the world for the Airbus single-aisle aircraft family. Airlines in the Indigo Partners family previously have placed orders for 427 A320 Family aircraft.

“This significant commitment for 430 additional aircraft underscores our optimistic view of the growth potential of our family of low-cost airlines, as well as our confidence in the A320neo Family as a platform for that growth,” said Bill Franke. “Our airlines know that a great aircraft coupled with a great business plan will create value for our customers. We look forward to bringing comfort and low fares to more passengers around the world as Wizz Air, Volaris, JetSMART and Frontier continue to expand.”

John Leahy said; “Indigo Partners have been a tremendous customer and supporter of the Airbus single-aisle fleet for many years. An order for 430 aircraft is remarkable, but it’s particularly gratifying to all of us at Airbus when it comes from a group of airline professionals who know our products as well as the folks at Indigo Partners do. We are proud to augment their airline fleets in Latin America, North America and Europe with the single-aisle aircraft that offers the lowest operating costs, longest range and most spacious cabin: the A320neo Family.”

Also present at the announcement were Enrique Beltranena, CEO of Volaris; Barry Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines; Estuardo Ortiz, CEO of JetSMART; and József Váradi, CEO of Wizz Air. They confirmed their firm’s individual aircraft orders as follows:

Wizz - 72 A320neo, 74 A321neo

Frontier - 100 A320neo, 34 A321neo

JetSMART - 56 A320neo, 14 A321neo

Volaris - 46 A320neo, 34 A321neo

Indigo Partners’ Bill Franke indicated that engine selections will be made and announced at a later date.

The A320neo Family incorporates the very latest technologies, including new generation engines and Sharklet wing-tip devices, which together will deliver 20 percent fuel savings by 2020. With more than 5,200 orders received from 95 customers since its launch in 2010, the A320neo Family has captured nearly 60 percent market share.

Indigo Partners LLC, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is a private equity fund focused on worldwide investments in air transportation."

Passengers to enjoy unrivaled comfort and convenience of Hawaii inspired interior

Hawaiian Airlines has taken delivery of its first Airbus A321neo, the highly fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft the Honolulu-based carrier will use to expand its service on routes to U.S. West Coast markets beginning in early 2018.

Hawaiian will launch daily A321neo non-stop service between Maui and Portland in January. This will be followed by A321neo service on the Kaua’i-Oakland and Kona-Los Angeles routes as Hawaiian receives additional aircraft. Airbus will deliver a second A321neo to Hawaiian later in 2017 with 14 aircraft to be delivered in 2018 and beyond.

“Our new A321neos are ideal for our West Coast to Hawaii markets. They will bring Hawaiian’s unique blend of Hawaiian hospitality and industry-leading operational performance to more travelers than ever,” said Mark Dunkerley, President and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “As we welcome our A321neo fleet, some of our wide-body aircraft serving the U.S. West Coast will be deployed for further long-haul expansion.”

“Airbus aims to further its customers’ goals for passenger and revenue growth, and market penetration by incorporating new technology and design into industry-leading models that deliver both a better passenger experience and economic efficiency,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. “For a unique and discerning airline like Hawaiian, the A321neo delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and lower noise and CO 2 emissions, reducing the environmental impact.”

Hawaiian’s A321neo seats comfortably 189 passengers in a three-class configuration, including 16 First Class, 45 Premium Economy, and 128 Economy seats. The aircraft is equipped with the airline’s signature “Hawaii Inspired” interior cabin, which draws on the islands’ natural beauty. LED cabin lighting evokes Hawaii’s spectacular sunrises and sunsets and reflects the islands’ idyllic environment in textiles, textures, and color. Passengers will also enjoy wireless streaming entertainment and benefit from additional overhead stowage volume thanks to new pivoting bins.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney PurePower engines and ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operations) certified for lengthy overwater flights, the A321neo will allow Hawaiian to fly more direct and fuel-efficient routes.

The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family, seating up to 240 passengers, depending on cabin configuration. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances, and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a reduction in fuel consumption of at least 15 percent per seat from day one and 20 percent by 2020 as well as a 50 percent noise reduction."
"Frontier will triple in size over next 10 years, parent places $49.5 billion order for Airbus planes - The Denver Post","Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvMTUvZnJvbnRpZXItYm9vc3RzLWZsZWV0LXNpemUv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAxNy8xMS8xNS9mcm9udGllci1ib29zdHMtZmxlZXQtc2l6ZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Airbus signed a $49.5 billion deal on Wednesday to sell 430 airplanes to the Phoenix-based private equity firm that owns Frontier Airlines, striking the European aerospace firm’s biggest deal ever at the Dubai Air Show.

Meanwhile, Boeing reached an agreement with low-cost carrier FlyDubai to sell 225 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft — a deal valued at $27 billion. The biennial air show closes on Thursday.

“It’s ended up going out on a high,” airline analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting said. “It shows once again the importance of this part of the world to the big airplane manufacturers.”

The Airbus deal with Indigo Partners will split 273 A320neos and 157 A321neos among Denver-based Frontier, JetSMART of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and Wizz Air of Hungary, all ultra-low-cost airlines associated with Indigo.

The A320neo and the A321neo are twin-engine, single-aisle planes popular among airlines because of their reduced fuel consumption.

Denver-based Frontier said the order signals the ultra-low-cost carrier’s intent to triple in size over the next decade. CEO Barry Biffle in a news release said the new aircraft will moderize the fleet and put Frontier in a position to carry more than 50 million passengers a year by 2026.

The aircraft are to be delivered to Frontier from Airbus’s plant in Mobile, Alabama, between 2021 and 2026.

The surprise announcement came after Airbus on Sunday suffered the embarrassment of believing it had struck a major deal with the state-owned carrier Emirates to sell its A380 double-decker jumbo jet, only to see Boeing sit on the podium with the airline and sign a $15.1 billion deal.

“Just to clarify: This is not an A380 press conference,” joked John Leahy, Airbus’ sales chief, at the start of the announcement.

A320neos list for $108.4 million apiece and A321neos at $127 million. Airlines and manufacturers negotiate lower prices for big deals like these, something Indigo’s managing partner Bill Franke was quick to stress afterward.

“Here’s hoping,” he told reporters. “Their objective is to sell aircraft at the best possible and our objective is to buy aircraft at the best possible price. I’ve known Mr. Leahy for 25 years. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I win.”

Asked if he won this round, Franke said: “That’ll be a good question.”

Airbus’ previous biggest-ever sale came in August 2015, when it sold 250 A320neos to Indian budget airline IndiGo, a deal estimated to be worth $26 billion at list prices. IndiGo and Indigo Partners are separate firms with separate management.

Shares in Airbus rose on the news, closing 2.4 percent higher at 85.58 euros in Paris.

Franke is a pioneer of the cheap ticket and high fee airline business that has spread overseas and is growing in the United States. Such carriers offer low base fares but add fees to stow a carry-on bag, get an assigned seat and for other extras. That’s led to soaring customer complaints against Frontier.

President Donald Trump also came up in Franke’s conversation with journalists on Thursday, as Franke said the American leader would be happy to know the A321neos purchased by Indigo would undergo final assembly in the Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Shortly after, FlyDubai and Chicago-based Boeing Co. announced their $27 billion deal. FlyDubai said the planes would bring the low-cost carrier’s total fleet on order up to 320. FlyDubai has begun to code-share flights with Emirates. Both are owned by Dubai’s government.

The Boeing 737 MAX 10, a twin-engine, single aisle plane capable of carrying 230 passengers, has a list price of $124.7 million. They’ll complement FlyDubai’s fleet of Boeing 737s and keep them a Boeing-only shop, something Airbus no doubt had hoped to change.

“Today marks the next chapter in FlyDubai’s success story,” FlyDubai CEO Ghaith al-Ghaith said.

Until Wednesday, the only major deal announced at the Dubai Air Show came on Sunday, when long-haul carrier Emirates purchased 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners in a $15.1 billion deal.

That deal also saw Emirates CEO and Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum bring up the 787-10 buy’s ability to create jobs. Trump himself promoted that during a February visit to the South Carolina plant that builds the carbon-fiber, 330-seat plane.

Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has pinned hopes of continuing production of its A380 double-decker jumbo jet on Emirates, the world’s largest operator of the aircraft. Reports circulated before the air show that a major A380 sale would be coming.

Airbus employees even filled a news conference on Sunday, expecting the A380 sale, instead to find state-owned Emirates making the deal with Boeing in front of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Strickland said that while the massive Airbus sale Wednesday likely took months to negotiate, it still helped Airbus save face at the air show.

“It would have been great relief,” the analyst said.

Emirates now relies solely on the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 777 for its flights, making it the largest operator of both. It has 165 Boeing 777s in its fleet today and took possession of its 100th A380 earlier this month.

The Emirates’ snub came up at the news conference Wednesday, when a reporter asked Airbus if another deal could be coming.

“I think you’ve got to walk over to the chalet with Emirates on the door and ask them,” Airbus’ Leahy said.

Airbus has been selected by Singapore Airlines (SIA) to provide cabin retrofit services for 14 A380 aircraft currently in service with the carrier. The retrofit programme, which will be undertaken at SIA Engineering Company in Singapore, will see the airline’s recently launched cabin products installed on the aircraft. The new cabin products will debut on five new A380s to be delivered this year and next year.

Under the agreement, Services by Airbus will be responsible for Service Bulletin (SB) and aircraft cabin parts-kit delivery. Its teams will also contribute their A380 design knowledge and engineering expertise to integrate SIA’s customised cabin fittings into the A380’s spacious double-deck interior. The retrofit work is expected to start in late 2018, with all 14 aircraft scheduled for completion by 2020.

Singapore Airlines’ new A380 cabin offers more personal space in all classes. The aircraft will accommodate a total of 471 passengers, with six private Suites and 78 Business Class seats on the upper deck and 44 Premium Economy Class and 343 Economy Class seats on the main deck.

“We are very pleased to have been selected by Singapore Airlines to integrate its new A380 cabin, which will offer its passengers the best and latest on-board products,” said Laurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus. “Singapore Airlines’ trust in our retrofit competencies is a positive sign for the development of our services business, in particular in the fast growing Asia-Pacific region.”

Airbus’ Global Market Forecast projects that over the next 20 years the commercial aircraft upgrades services market will be worth US$180 billion, driven in part by high competition between airlines who value the ‘passenger experience’ as a differentiator (comfort, connectivity etc.), as well as systems upgrades. Notably, 38 per cent of this demand will come from the Asia-Pacific region.

"With triple the number of jets, Frontier Airlines wants to more than triple its customers in a decade - The Denver Post","Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvMTUvZnJvbnRpZXItYWlyYnVzLWpldC1wdXJjaGFzZS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzExLzE1L2Zyb250aWVyLWFpcmJ1cy1qZXQtcHVyY2hhc2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the verge of going out of business less than a decade ago, Denver’s Frontier Airlines is now charting a course to triple in size within the next 10 years.

On Wednesday, the ultra-low-cost carrier bought 134 fuel-efficient A320neo Family Airbus jets that aviation-industry experts say are well suited to get it there.

Whether the big buy will pay off in the long run is, however, up for debate.

“It’s state of the art for the type of aircraft for their business model,” airline industry consultant George Hamlin said of the planes that will be joining Frontier’s fleet between 2021 and 2026. “This is a bold stroke. But there is an old saying: There are old pilots and bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots.”

Frontier’s big purchase — listing price $15 billion — was a slice of a larger pie. Indigo Partners, the private equity firm that owns Frontier, on Wednesday signed a $49.5 billion deal for 430 A320neo Family planes, Airbus’s biggest deal ever. The twin-engine, single-aisle planes will be split between Frontier and other Indigo carriers, JetSmart of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and Wizz Air of Hungary.The jets are popular with budget airlines because of reduced fuel consumption.

Frontier already had orders out for 67 A320neo aircraft prior to Wednesday’s announcement. The carrier also had ordered 18 A319neo planes that it has converted to the 320neo family, meaning it will be receiving 85 of the jets even before the new order is filled.

The new planes will triple the size of Frontier’s fleet from the 70 today to more than 200 by the time all are delivered and have animal photos slapped on their tails, spokesman Richard Oliver said. After carrying 15 million people to their destinations in 2016, Frontier’s stated goal is to serve 50 million flyers in 2026.

“Most of this is funding growth of the airline,” Oliver said. “Current deliveries end in 2021 with existing orders, so it was time to evaluate the fleet needs looking forward.”

The order comes as the airline is working to expand its service network, eventually increasing its total number of destinations by 30 percent and doubling its number of routes. That expansion, announced at Denver International Airport in July, will be complete in the next six months, Oliver said. The airline currently reaches 80 destinations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Dominican Republic via 300 daily flights.

Hamlin, the president of Fairfax, Va.-based Hamlin Transportation Consulting, said Frontier’s business model — where passengers pay low fares but are charged extra for carry on bags and for other services that come standard on larger airlines — is basically a commodity in his view. Customers would consider another carrier if the fare was $10 or $15 cheaper. By growing and by adding new, less-experienced flight crews, Frontier can keep costs down, but Hamlin wondered how far the airline can go with that model.

“The fact that you are basically going to triple in size should have a positive impact on operating cost, but can you continue that?” Hamlin said. “This resembles a Ponzi scheme in that you can’t keep it up forever. The airline has got to become and remain profitable consistently for things to work. You will have to put more cash into the business.”

Frontier filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June in advance of an anticipated public stock offering.

The offering has not happened yet, and company officials decline to comment on the status, but the paperwork does provide insight into Frontier’s recent surge. The company’s net income has risen the past two years, reaching $200 million in 2016. It was $146 million in 2015 and $140 million in 2014. That comes as the airline has spent less on fuel. Frontier paid $343 million to gas up its jets last year, down from $369 million in 2015 and $538 million in 2014. The airline’s revenues for nonticket services, such as baggage fees, nearly doubled to $726 million last year from $401 million in 2015.

Frontier’s pending bigger fleet will mean new jobs. The expansion should create more than 5,000 positions with the airline, including pilots, operations staff and roles at corporate headquarters, Oliver said. Frontier is looking to hire 160 pilots and 500 flight attendants next year alone, he said.

The airline is in the midst of mediation with its pilot union over a new contract. That union, representing about 1,200 pilots, has already vowed to strike if terms cannot be reached.

Capt. Alan Christie, who handles public relations for the Air Line Pilots Association’s Frontier unit, wondered Wednesday how his employer hopes to attract pilots amid a national shortage when it is offering contracts that he says are 40 percent below market rates. He said the airline’s greatly expanded fleet would require at least doubling its number of pilots.

“What (this purchase) tells me is that they found a niche that they are very good at and they see market potential for that type of airplane,” Christie said. “Without getting a market-rate contract in place, we’re frankly questioning how they intend to attract qualified pilots to achieve that growth.”"

Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Siemens are collaborating to create the technology necessary for a hybrid electric plane, the companies said Tuesday. Known as the ""E-Fan X programme,"" the collaboration started in 2012 as a response to the European Union's desire to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and nitrogen oxide pollution.

While the companies want to test a hybrid electric plane by 2020 and have one flying commercial flights by 2025, their goals are more modest in the short term. The first step is creating an electric engine that could be placed on a traditional aircraft, the BAe 146.

The most pressing obstacle the companies will have to overcome is the current weight of the batteries and cooling equipment necessary for electric flight. If they're able to do so, it could make life much easier for airlines, who devote a significant amount of their budgets to fuel costs. Electric motors would also reduce the amount of noise airplanes make, which could allow airlines to schedule more evening flights."

Remember Tempe-based America West Airlines?

Its former chairman and CEO Bill Franke is making international headlines for a planned nearly $50 billion purchase of 430 Airbus jets.

Franke, 80, is the head of Phoenix-based Indigo Partners, a low-key investment firm with offices in the Camelback Esplanade complex.

The firm specializes in airline investments and owns discount carrier Frontier Airlines and a few international budget carriers. Indigo previously owned discounter Spirit Airlines.

Franke, a longtime Arizona business executive, fell in love with the airline industry in the early 1990s when he was asked by then-Arizona Gov. Fife Symington to organize local investors to help America West Airlines reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

When the airline emerged from bankruptcy in 1994, Symington hailed him as a “modern American corporate alchemist.”

The America West gig started as a temporary job, but Franke ended up leading America West as chairman and chief executive officer, a position he held until 2001. He was succeeded by Doug Parker. Parker is now the chairman and CEO of American Airlines. Parker engineered the 2005 merger of America West and US Airways and the 2013 merger of the new US Airways and American Airlines.

Despite bruising battles with America West’s unions, major layoffs and other challenges during Franke's nearly 10-year tenure at America West, the airline industry got into the no-nonsense executive’s blood.

Franke went on to become chairman of successful discounter Spirit Airlines, based in Florida, and a few foreign airlines. The firm bought Frontier in 2013 and switched it to a budget airline model, with low fares and a pile of add-on fees.

In Arizona, Franke's name is on the business school at Northern Arizona University.

In a 2013 interview, Franke recalled how America West's founding executives didn’t let him forget he was an industry newbie.

“No offense intended,’’ one executive told him, “ but probably the only thing you know about the airline industry is sitting in (seat) 14D.’’

Poised for the future - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 01 Nov 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3BvaXNlZC1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s no secret that tough times have been had in the helicopter industry, but this has not stopped Airbus Helicopters. On the contrary–the leader in the civil and parapublic market yet again this year continues to set its sights on providing the best helicopters and services to customers who protect, serve, save lives and transport citizens in the safest and most efficient way possible.

Thanks to a robust product development and internationalization strategy, the company is drawing closer to customers in key emerging markets, improving its existing products and setting the standard for the future of rotary-wing aviation.

At this year’s Helitech International Helicopter Expo and Conference, Airbus Helicopters will showcase on stand No. C100 an H145 for emergency medical services (EMS) use, as well as a private and business aviation (PBA) H125.

Building on its leadership in the PBA market, Airbus Helicopters launched last May Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH), offering a unique level of quality finish, craftsmanship and bespoke service for the most demanding requirements. The versatile H125 is a go-to aircraft for multiple missions, with more than 4,500 in operation around the world.

The twin-engine H145 is one of the company’s best sellers for EMS, law enforcement and offshore wind turbine missions. Since the beginning of the year, German company Wiking Helikopter Service has been flying the first H145 in offshore configuration to operate in the North Sea.

Wiking transports men and equipment to offshore wind power platforms and facilities, a mission that requires helicopters to meet the most stringent safety, performance and cost-effectiveness requirements. With most of its flights taking place in the colder months of the year when the sea is too rough to transport people by boat, Wiking relies on the power and reliability of the H145.

Another reason for the success of the H145 in this specific mission is its increased maximum power with one engine inoperative (OEI) and the ability to hover outside ground effect for two minutes. This allows Wiking to carry an additional 350 kilograms (770 pounds) of payload, which is crucial for offshore wind farm operations.

A considerable advantage of the large and diverse Airbus Helicopters fleet is the true standardization in the cockpit, thanks to the in-house designed avionics system, Helionix.

Available on the H175, H145, H135 and the future H160, Helionix has been hailed by users for its intuitive human machine interface and autopilot, allowing pilots to concentrate on the mission rather than multiple instrument feeds and inputs. The rotary-wing element of the U.K. Military Flying Training System was the first program to benefit from Helionix across its H135 and H145 fleets, with the customer’s initial fielding team demonstrating how the commonality Helionix offers can help optimize the training experience and ease transition to frontline aircraft.

To date, Airbus Helicopters has already delivered all three contracted H145 aircraft and 12 of the 29 H135s on order–all fitted with the latest standard Helionix system. Two additional Helionix H135s are scheduled for delivery to NOLAS and DRF this year. The H135 is the unbeaten market leader in light, twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopters.

Earlier this summer, the heavy twin H215 helicopter, a member of the world-renowned Super Puma family, demonstrated its multi-mission capabilities for firefighting, power line missions, law enforcement, and passenger transportation during its debut demo tour in China–a key country for Airbus Helicopters’ development.

The two-week-long tour took the H215 on ferry flights from Zhuhai to Shenzhen to Lijiang, covering more than 2,000 kilometers (more than 1,200 miles) and attesting in real time to its excellent long range capabilities, power, speed, and large useful payload. The highly robust and versatile H215 is perfectly suited to meet China’s growing demand for heavy helicopters as it prepares to build up its forest aerial surveillance and firefighting capabilities.

It will easily complement the current fleet of nearly 40 Super Puma aircraft already in the country. Airbus Helicopters is the leader in the civil turbine market in China with a market share of about 40 percent, and has seen steady annual growth of about 20 percent over the past five years. Construction has begun on the H135 final assembly line (FAL) in Qingdao, which is the first FAL established by a Western helicopter manufacturer in the country.

The H160, unveiled at Heli-Expo 2015 in Orlando, Florida, is pioneering changes in the way Airbus Helicopters designs, industrializes and supports helicopters with new development tools such as the system helicopter zero and the dynamic helicopter zero and three traditional prototypes, all aiming to bring the aircraft to a level of operational maturity at entry into service. By July 2017, the two flying prototypes had culminated around 500 flight hours and were expected to be joined at the end of the summer by a third prototype.

“We will be continuing flight demos in the second semester for potential customers so that they can experience first-hand the advantages of Helionix and the incredible cockpit visibility,” said Bernard Fujarski, senior vice president and head of the H160 program. “They will also experience the new standard in vibration levels even at high speeds and the groundbreaking advance in sound control provided by the Blue Edge blades,” he added.

While the prototypes continue certification testing like this summer’s hot weather campaign, ahead of entry into service in 2019, the H160 program has been focusing on preparing the industrialization and the maintenance aspects of the serial aircraft. During the summer, one of the prototypes was used during the Operator Zero campaign to mature the maintenance plan, the technical publications and support tools prior to entry into service. Airbus Helicopters will inaugurate the H160’s brand new integrated final assembly line which will start operations at the end of 2017.

The H175, coming to a platform near you

The H175 has made a strong debut in the oil-and-gas world, demonstrating a new standard in comfort and reliability in offshore operations and having flown more than 10,000 hours to date.

There are currently 13 H175s flying for offshore transportation for three different customers in the North Sea and one in the Gulf of Mexico, as the H175 makes its mark in this mission segment. The H175 provides outstanding performance and unmatched cost efficiency, offering low direct maintenance costs (DMC) for its class.

The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) extension to 7.8 tonnes was certified end of 2016 and will be introduced in all H175s this year. Customers appreciate its excellent handling characteristics, speed and range, and passengers are impressed with the cabin comfort, smooth ride and low sound levels.

In the North Sea, the H175 can already be seen flying out of Aberdeen, Den Helder and Ejberg."

The tested system included guns (FN Herstal HMP400), unguided rockets (Thales FZ231) and cannons (Nexter NC621) as well as an electro-optical targeting system by Wescam (MX15) and a helmet mounted sight display by Thales (Scorpion). All planned and required tests were performed in a tight and demanding time schedule.

“This is an important milestone towards the qualification of HForce on the H145M, which is planned for end 2018”, said Axel Humpert, Head of H145 Programme. “The positive results of this first ballistic development test are the outcome of a very good and professional cooperation between all parties involved, especially with the Hungarian Ministry of Defence.”

Next steps prior to the qualification of HForce on the H145M are the development testing of laser-guided rockets in Sweden before the end of the year as well as additional live-firing trials in summer 2018.

HForce is an innovative, incremental and integrated high performance weapon system that can easily be fitted (“plug and play”) into Airbus Helicopter’s military platforms such as H125M, H145M and H225M for ambitious and smart military operations where flexibility of mission equipment is a vital criterion. It is designed to meet the requirements of defence agencies seeking light attack mission capabilities or a complement to their existing fleet of specialized attack helicopters. Meanwhile, qualification of the core HForce system is on track for end 2017, following an extensive flight-test campaign carried out on a H225M testbed.

The H145M is a proven military helicopter, derived from the H145, a rugged workhorse and best in its class for rough EMS and police missions. First delivery of the H145 took place in 2014. The entire H145 fleet has now clocked up more than 80,000 flight hours. With a maximum take-off weight of 3.7 tonnes the H145M is an agile light attack helicopter. It perfectly matches the needs of Special Forces, can be used for a wide range of tasks, including armed reconnaissance, ground fire support, anti-tank warfare, escort, tactical transport, MEDEVAC and CASEVAC. Customers for the H145M include Germany – which in June received their 15th and final H145M LUH SOF helicopter on time and on budget – as well as the Republic of Serbia and the Kingdom of Thailand.

Airbus to sell 430 planes to Phoenix-based Indigo for $49.5B - KMPH Fox 26,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8va21waC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvYWlyYnVzLXRvLXNlbGwtNDMwLXBsYW5lcy10by1waG9lbml4LWJhc2VkLWluZGlnby1mb3ItNDk1YtIBYWh0dHBzOi8va21waC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL2FpcmJ1cy10by1zZWxsLTQzMC1wbGFuZXMtdG8tcGhvZW5peC1iYXNlZC1pbmRpZ28tZm9yLTQ5NWI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Airbus signed a $49.5 billion deal on Wednesday to sell 430 airplanes to the Phoenix-based private equity firm that owns Frontier Airlines, striking the European aerospace firm's biggest deal ever at the Dubai Air Show.





Meanwhile, Boeing reached an agreement with low-cost carrier FlyDubai to sell 225 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft — a deal valued at $27 billion. The biennial air show closes on Thursday.

""It's ended up going out on a high,"" airline analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting said. ""It shows once again the importance of this part of the world to the big airplane manufacturers.""

The Airbus deal with Indigo Partners will split 273 A320neos and 157 A321neos among Denver-based Frontier, JetSMART of Chile, Volaris of Mexico and Wizz Air of Hungary, all ultra-low-cost airlines associated with Indigo.

The A320neo and the A321neo are twin-engine, single-aisle planes popular among airlines because of their reduced fuel consumption.

The surprise announcement came after Airbus on Sunday suffered the embarrassment of believing it had struck a major deal with the state-owned carrier Emirates to sell its A380 double-decker jumbo jet, only to see Boeing sit on the podium with the airline and sign a $15.1 billion deal.

""Just to clarify: This is not an A380 press conference,"" joked John Leahy, Airbus' sales chief, at the start of the announcement.

A320neos list for $108.4 million apiece and A321neos at $127 million. Airlines and manufacturers negotiate lower prices for big deals like these, something Indigo's managing partner Bill Franke was quick to stress afterward.

""Here's hoping,"" he told reporters. ""Their objective is to sell aircraft at the best possible and our objective is to buy aircraft at the best possible price. I've known Mr. Leahy for 25 years. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I win.""

Asked if he won this round, Franke said: ""That'll be a good question.""

Airbus' previous biggest-ever sale came in August 2015, when it sold 250 A320neos to Indian budget airline IndiGo, a deal estimated to be worth $26 billion at list prices. IndiGo and Indigo Partners are separate firms with separate management.

Shares in Airbus rose on the news, closing 2.4 percent higher at 85.58 euros in Paris.

Franke is a pioneer of the cheap ticket and high fee airline business that has spread overseas and is growing in the United States. Such carriers offer low base fares but add fees to stow a carry-on bag, get an assigned seat and for other extras. That's led to soaring customer complaints against Frontier.

President Donald Trump also came up in Franke's conversation with journalists on Thursday, as Franke said the American leader would be happy to know the A321neos purchased by Indigo would undergo final assembly in the Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Shortly after, FlyDubai and Chicago-based Boeing Co. announced their $27 billion deal. FlyDubai said the planes would bring the low-cost carrier's total fleet on order up to 320. FlyDubai has begun to code-share flights with Emirates. Both are owned by Dubai's government.

The Boeing 737 MAX 10, a twin-engine, single aisle plane capable of carrying 230 passengers, has a list price of $124.7 million. They'll complement FlyDubai's fleet of Boeing 737s and keep them a Boeing-only shop, something Airbus no doubt had hoped to change.

""Today marks the next chapter in FlyDubai's success story,"" FlyDubai CEO Ghaith al-Ghaith said.

Until Wednesday, the only major deal announced at the Dubai Air Show came on Sunday, when long-haul carrier Emirates purchased 40 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners in a $15.1 billion deal.

That deal also saw Emirates CEO and Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum bring up the 787-10 buy's ability to create jobs. Trump himself promoted that during a February visit to the South Carolina plant that builds the carbon-fiber, 330-seat plane.

Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has pinned hopes of continuing production of its A380 double-decker jumbo jet on Emirates, the world's largest operator of the aircraft. Reports circulated before the air show that a major A380 sale would be coming.

Airbus employees even filled a news conference on Sunday, expecting the A380 sale, instead to find state-owned Emirates making the deal with Boeing in front of Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Strickland said that while the massive Airbus sale Wednesday likely took months to negotiate, it still helped Airbus save face at the air show.

""It would have been great relief,"" the analyst said.

Emirates now relies solely on the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 777 for its flights, making it the largest operator of both. It has 165 Boeing 777s in its fleet today and took possession of its 100th A380 earlier this month.

The Emirates' snub came up at the news conference Wednesday, when a reporter asked Airbus if another deal could be coming.

""I think you've got to walk over to the chalet with Emirates on the door and ask them,"" Airbus' Leahy said.

Skyways: urban air delivery explored - Airbus,"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTExLXNreXdheXMtdXJiYW4tYWlyLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWV4cGxvcmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As we move towards a future where autonomous urban flight becomes technologically normalised, we need to develop a world that can welcome and support it. This means proving safety, efficacy, and economic viability for the technologies and the operational management systems supporting them.

In February 2016, Airbus Helicopters signed an agreement with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore for “Project Skyways” to experiment with and develop the regulations, technologies, and operational requirements to safely operate a drone parcel delivery service in urban environments. The Unmanned Air System (UAS) developed by Airbus to meet such requirements will be first demonstrated on the campus of the National University of Singapore (NUS) in early 2018.

The Skyways UAS over the NUS campus aims to provide efficient delivery of small parcels to students and faculties using a “system-of-system” of drones, ground control systems, air navigation systems, operational procedures, and maintenance procedures that embodies aviation safety at the core of its design. After this pilot test, we are hopeful that commercial projects will be possible to launch in the Asian city and to extend the testing to passenger transport.

The Skyways drone is a fully autonomous octocopter that flies parcels in containers located on its underside along routes called ‘aerial corridors’ to-and-from designated stations where it is automatically loaded or unloaded. These “parcel stations” store the delivered parcels in lockers which a customer can open at any time once receiving notification on their smartphone of the arrival of their package.

The success of Skyways will help evolve the regulatory and operational framework for the use of autonomous air vehicles in an urban area and be a first step towards self-piloted aircraft system operations in our future cities.

At this year’s Singapore Airshow, a fully-functioning Skyways autonomous parcel delivery drone will be on display, which is at an advanced stage of development in collaboration with partners in Singapore."
Airlines are using fewer Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 jumbo jets - Quartz,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzExNDEyMzMvYXJlLXdlLXdpdG5lc3NpbmctdGhlLWVuZC1vZi10aGUtanVtYm8tamV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First it was the Boeing 747 now it’s the Airbus A380. The world’s largest airplanes are falling out of favor with passenger airlines.

In 2017, as the slow death march of the 747 continued, the number of A380 flights was stalling. Departure growth of the A380—the rate airlines are flying new flights with the plane—is at its lowest ever. 2018 could be the plane’s turning point.

Emirates, the largest operator of the A380 with 100 planes, is in negotiations to order more but is dragging its feet. Amedeo, one of the worlds largest leasers of A380s, recently announced plans to start an A380-only airline rather than continue to face the difficulty of leasing the planes to reticent operators.

Additionally, competition from budget airlines has caused carriers to reassess every expense. With four engines each, both the A380 and Boeing 747 are gas guzzlers. As such, over the last decade, airlines looking to carry high volumes of passengers have turned to two-engine models, like the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330.

Jumbo jets also have higher operational costs. That’s not an issue for companies that can fill larger planes and spread the cost over hundreds of passengers, but larger planes are harder to fill.

The same passengers that fill an A380 can be distributed to a number of smaller planes, and that allows airlines to control more runway slots at airports. From a competitive standpoint, more takeoffs and landings means less room for the competition, even if those competitors have the biggest plane in the market."

The new cabin results from four years of development and an investment by the airline of $850 million, reaffirming its ongoing full commitment to the aircraft type.

“Singapore Airlines set new industry benchmarks for premium full-service travel when we introduced our first A380s in October 2007,” said Marvin Tan, Senior Vice President - Product & Services. “A decade later, we continue to receive highly positive feedback about the travel experience on the aircraft.”

The new cabin products were unveiled yesterday in Singapore with the theme: “Space made personal, experience the difference.” Their service entry is to begin next month with the delivery of the first of five new A380s. Retrofit work will start in late 2018 on 14 aircraft already in service, with all targeted for completion in 2020.

Leased Airbus A330s to help grow AirAsia X network - Aviation Week,"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2xlYXNlZC1haXJidXMtYTMzMHMtaGVscC1ncm93LWFpcmFzaWEteC1uZXR3b3Jr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AirAsia X, the low-cost long-haul subsidiary of AirAsia, is to lease more Airbus A330s in 2018 to focus on shorter China routes and redeploy its existing fleet to new markets.

The carrier operates a core fleet of 30 A330-300s, with a seat configuration of 12 Premium Flatbeds and 365 economy seats. It said the third-party leased aircraft would be all-economy class and be deployed on medium-haul routes.

The move will support its network expansion before its A330neos are due to arrive towards the end of next year. AirAsia X currently has 66 A330-900s on order.

“Looking ahead, we continue to fine tune our network and introduce new markets that strengthen our network, as well as support our revenue and profitability targets,” said Datuk Kamarudin Meranun, chief executive of AirAsia X Group.

“Earlier this month, we launched Kuala Lumpur-Jeju and Kuala Lumpur-Jaipur which will commence inaugural flights in December 2017 and February 2018 respectively.

“Our bookings for 4Q17 and 1Q18 are ahead of last year showing that demand to fly remains strong and reflects growing evidence that consumers are prioritising expenditure on flights and holidays above other non-essential items.”

AirAsia X posted a net loss of 43.3 million ringgit ($10.6m) in the three months to 30 September 2017, compared with 11 million ringgit profit a year earlier, due to a one-off provision for doubtful debt.

Revenue climbed to 1.12 billion ringgit ($273.6m), up 14 percent year-on-year, boosted by a 22 percent increase in scheduled flight revenue and 29 percent rise in ancillary revenue.

During the July-September period, the number of passengers carried jumped 23 percent to 1.5 million.

AirAsia X Thailand’s financial performance weakened in the third quarter, but AirAsia X Indonesia posted profit of $2.15m on the back of strong revenue performance especially from its Denpasar-Narita and Denpasar-Kuala Lumpur routes.

Earlier this month, AirAsia X celebrated its tenth anniversary at at Gold Coast International Airport, Australia, which was the maiden destination of the carrier on 2 November 2007.

Datuk Kamarudin Meranun said: “This tenth anniversary is definitely a memorable milestone for all of us at AirAsia X. For an airline that many thought would not succeed in the beginning, we sure have a lot to celebrate for after ten amazing years.

“We have grown from strength to strength since our inception in 2007, having flown over 30 million guests to over 25 destinations in different regions including the US, while at the same time forming the most extensive flight network of over 125 destinations in Asia and beyond with our short-haul affiliate AirAsia to serve a broader spectrum of guests, making us one of the largest airline groups in the world.”"
Airbus to build Türksat 5A and 5B satellites - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMS1haXJidXMtdG8tYnVpbGQtdHVya3NhdC01YS1hbmQtNWItc2F0ZWxsaXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Türksat contract for Airbus

First all-electric satellites for Türksat

Ankara / Toulouse, 09/11/2017 - A contract for two new generation communications satellites was signed today by Türksat with Airbus Defence and Space.

The satellites, Türksat 5A and Türksat 5B, are based on the latest Electric Orbit Raising (EOR) version of Airbus’ highly reliable Eurostar E3000 platform, which uses electric

propulsion for in-orbit raising and station-keeping. “We are very pleased to welcome Türksat as a new Eurostar customer for the most powerful satellites of their fleet. We were the first to demonstrate full electric propulsion technology for satellites of this size and capacity, and this will enable the Türksat spacecraft to be launched in the most cost-efficient manner,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.

Türksat 5A is a broadcast satellite which will operate in Ku-band at the 31⁰ East longitude slot in geostationary orbit, covering Turkey, the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and South Africa. The spacecraft will have a launch mass of 3,500 kg and electrical power of 12 kW. It is planned for in-orbit delivery in 2020.

Türksat 5B is a broadband satellite which will operate in Ku- and Ka-bands at the 42⁰ East longitude slot in geostationary orbit. Its HTS (High Throughput Satellite) payload will provide more than 50 Gbps of capacity over a wide coverage including Turkey, the Middle East and large regions of Africa. The spacecraft will have a launch mass of 4,500 kg and electrical power of 15 kW. It is planned for in-orbit delivery in 2021.

The satellites will be built by Airbus in its UK and French facilities, with valuable Turkish contribution. Both satellites are planned for a service lifetime largely in excess of 15 years. Türksat 5A and Türksat 5B are the 57th and 58th Eurostar E3000 satellites ordered, and the 7th and 8th in the Eurostar E3000e version, which recently completed the fastest electric orbit raising ever from transfer to geostationary orbit.

Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB)has taken delivery of its first A350-900, leased from Air Lease Corporation (NYSE: AL) (ALC), becoming the 17th airline to operate the world’s newest, most modern and efficient twin engine widebody airliner. The delivery was celebrated upon arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

ALC receives its first A350-900 out of an order for 29 A350 Family aircraft. Eventually Malaysia Airlines will operate six A350-900s, all leased from ALC.

Malaysia Airlines will initially deploy the aircraft on flights within Asia. From the first quarter of 2018, the A350 will fly on the airline’s premier long haul service from Kuala Lumpur to London.

Malaysia Airlines is the first carrier to offer a First Class cabin in the A350-900. The aircraft is configured in a three class cabin layout with a total of 286 seats. This comprises four in First Class, 35 in Business, featuring convertible seats to fully flat beds and 247 in Economy.

Malaysia Airlines already operates 24 Airbus aircraft including six A380, 15 A330-300 and three A330-200F on its regional routes and long haul services.

Malaysia Airlines CEO Captain Izham Ismail said, “We are very excited to welcome this new addition to our family. With its technological advancements the A350-900 is an important milestone for us on this journey, helping boost our competitiveness on our long haul flights. The addition of the A350-900 also underlines our commitment to operate a young and modern fleet.”

“Our first A350-900 represents a milestone for ALC, and for Malaysia Airlines. We are very confident that the A350-900 will deliver outstanding performance, efficiency, and economics for our airline customers” said John Plueger, CEO and President of Air Lease Corporation.

“We are proud at Airbus to count Malaysia Airlines as a new operator of the world’s most modern and efficient aircraft,’’ said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer- Customers, Airbus Commercial Aircraft. ‘’Congratulations also to ALC for receiving the first A350 XWB in its fleet, proving the popularity of this aircraft in the lessor community across the globe. We are looking forward to our continued partnership with Malaysia Airlines and ALC - two major companies in the aviation industry.’’
