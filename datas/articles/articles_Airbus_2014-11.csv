Airbus crafts 'disruptive' technology - AOPA,"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTQvbm92ZW1iZXIvMTkvYWlyYnVzLWlubm92YXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus crafts 'disruptive' technology Aerospace giant backs aircraft large and small

The multinational giant whose name is long associated with airlines has invested recently in a few notable aviation development efforts on a smaller scale. The electric E-Fan, an all-electric prototype that made its first flight in March, will be certified as a two-seat trainer and four-seat general aviation aircraft, the company announced in July —the same month that a partnership with the Perlan Project , a team building a high-altitude glider primarily for scientific research, was announced . Less than two months later, Aerion, a company working to bring a supersonic business jet to market in 2021, announced it has also secured Airbus backing, an agreement that will provide engineering and certification support from Airbus that promises to accelerate Aerion’s effort .

One might think Airbus is suddenly aiming small, so to speak, perhaps establishing a beachhead in general aviation that Wichita, Kansas, companies might worry about.

All of that begged a question: Is Airbus moving into the turf of Textron, Cirrus, and the like? Not exactly, said Chairman and CEO Allan McArtor, who oversees Airbus Group, Inc. operations and strategy in North America and Latin America.

“Our intent really is not to enter the general aviation market per se,” McArtor said in a telephone interview. “That would be really a departure from our core business.”

The E-Fan project (presented in detail on the Airbus Group website) will indeed be built by a subsidiary created for the purpose, and “it might spin off rather interestingly,” McArtor said. Scaled up to 50 or 100 seats, however, it could become a hot ticket for airlines seeking a low-noise, zero emission people-mover that requires no jet fuel. “Now we’re talking.”

McArtor said a dedicated team is working with Aerion to develop and certify the Mach 1.4 business jet envisioned. Airbus Group will learn much along the way, though McArtor does not envision that particular aircraft being scaled up for the transportation market. Airlines, said the former airline executive and FAA administrator, are primarily focused on seat mile cost rather than speed.

“The sonic modeling that they’ve done, sonic laminar flow, is very interesting to us,” McArtor said. “We have no intention of building or offering a supersonic business jet, but we like their business plan … for the first mover, the first guy, there’s a legitimate market.”

McArtor said Perlan II, the plan to build a carbon fiber glider able to reach 90,000 feet or higher, is interesting because of the data it will be able to collect to advance understanding of the uppermost reaches of the atmosphere. It didn’t hurt that some members of the Airbus Group leadership team are glider enthusiasts, McArtor added.

These projects are higher visibility than some, but by no means the sum total of Airbus Group investments in innovation. McArtor said the company is backing research that goes beyond aviation and aerospace, and the Airbus Group website offers details on many efforts that extend beyond aviation and aerospace. (Airbus, meanwhile, offers a look at future concepts for commercial aviation here.)

“What we’re really well-known for is innovation,” McArtor said. “For more than 40 years that’s been our value add to the industry. I think you’ll see Airbus more visible in the future as we continue to explore these very, very interesting and some very disruptive technologies.”

Disruptive, you say?

McArtor offered a couple of teasers about what else is in the pipeline: antennas being developed to significantly improve satellite connectivity for aircraft, and laser-based measurement of airspeed and angle of attack that could prove particularly useful for helicopters, replacing pitot static systems unable to provide precise or accurate airspeed information below 40 knots.

Airbus Group opened an innovation and research hub on the campus of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, in 2012, and McArtor said that is one of many collaborations with universities, laboratories, and other centers of innovation that promise to raise the company profile as a technology engine in the coming years.

“Best to just say stay tuned,” McArtor said."

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is hoping to patent a new plane that looks more like a doughnut or flying saucer than the usual cylinder-shaped passenger plane.



The France-based company filed a patent application at the end of October for a new type of aircraft, structured to limit the strain of cabin pressurization. The design also offers space for more passengers, who will sit in a 360 degree cabin, rather like an amphitheater. In the U.S. patent application, citing the investors as Patrick Lieven, Romain Delahaye and Catalin Perju, Airbus said that the usual ""cylindrical geometry"" of aircraft increased pressure at the front and back of planes and limited passenger-carrying capacity. ""The purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple, economic and efficient solution to these problems to at least partially overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages,"" the filing said.

Airbus Group Sells Part of Its Stake in Dassault Aviation - Airbus,"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNC0xMS1haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtc2VsbHMtcGFydC1vZi1pdHMtc3Rha2UtaW4tZGFzc2F1bHQtYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group (stock exchange symbol: AIR) in an off-market block trade has sold to Dassault Aviation a total of 810,072 Dassault Aviation shares at a price of € 980 per share, representing a total amount of around € 794 million pre transaction costs.

The French State has agreed to waive its rights under the shareholder agreement with Airbus Group, which provides in particular a right of first offer to its benefit, for this block trade, which represents approximately 8 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital.

After this transaction, Airbus Group will hold 38.32 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital and associated voting rights and then following the cancellation by Dassault Aviation of 9 percent of treasury shares, Airbus Group will own 42.11 percent of the Dassault shares with associated voting rights. In this context, Airbus Group will solicit from the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) an exemption to the requirement to launch a public offer.

Further to today’s block trade, Airbus Group has provided a best efforts commitment until 30 June 2015 to sell up to 10 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital, subject to market conditions. This additional transaction should take place in the form of an accelerated book-building through either one or several placements. Airbus Group will have the ability to increase the size of the placements beyond this 10 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital.

Dassault Aviation has committed to support the implementation of these efforts and will place an order on 50 percent of the size of such placements, within a global limit of 5 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital, at a maximum price of € 980 per share. Airbus Group has committed to serve Dassault Aviation with 50 percent of the shares sold and within the same global limit of 5 percent of Dassault Aviation’s share capital, at the price of the relevant placement. Should the placement price be higher than € 980, the price of the Dassault Aviation shares sold at the same time to Dassault Aviation would be capped thereat while the price of the shares sold to third parties would remain the same.

“This transaction marks an important step in our stated intentions to monetise our stake in Dassault Aviation. Furthermore, we have retained market and timing flexibility, together with support from Dassault Aviation, that should allow us to optimise further monetisation steps during 2015,” said Marwan Lahoud, Airbus Group Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer.

"Airbus interview: research, innovation and the future of aviation - ComputerWeekly.com","Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXB1dGVyd2Vla2x5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIyNDAyMzM5NDgvQWlyYnVzLUludGVydmlldy1yZXNlYXJjaC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWFuZC10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWF2aWF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Research and innovation is at the core of the Airbus business strategy. From creating lighter, quieter aircraft to implementing augmented reality for passengers in the cabin, the aircraft manufacturer is on the bleeding edge of design and technology. And IT plays a substantial role in creating the aircraft of the future.

Airbus research and development spend is among the highest in the world, standing at €3.1bn. Some 800 researchers work on its technical excellence strategy, which is shaped around 20 key technology strategies.

Simon Bradley, vice-president head of global innovation network, systems and product architecture and engineering at Airbus Group, said one of the really interesting areas is advanced manufacturing and the factory of the future, which uses processes and tools including 3D printing in the aerospace industry.

“The challenge is the things we make are very large and there’s a lot of investment involved in building an aircraft,” says Bradley.

He explains that it can be challenging to introduce disruptive technologies such as 3D printing to production lines which already work very well, often churning out 40 aircraft every month.

And the design, development, production and ongoing support process is enormously long. “When you look at the life of an aircraft, from the time someone puts it on a piece of paper, designs, tests and puts it into the world – it could potentially be 75 years,” says Bradley.

Software and hardware And 75 years is a long time when it comes to software. The Airbus A380 has 120 million lines of code. “When considering 120 million lines of software over a 75-year period, think about safety and quality – you can’t just bring it back for a quick software upgrade,” says Bradley. “And the international space station, the software that went up there, barring some updates, it has to work – you can’t send a software engineer into space.” More on Airbus Airbus deploys modular datacentre strategy to boost HPC capacity

Airbus looks north to reduce datacentre energy costs

Air France Airbus crash: its last few minutes? When building the A300 craft, Airbus had to maintain a complete library of all the code that was around in the 1970s. Additionally, aircraft require single-core processors which, in a smart technology market, are not easy to get hold of. “When building an aircraft, we have to stock up and buy lots of single-core processors, which is a major challenge,” he says, explaining that chip manufacturers no longer have an interest in making single-core processors. When building a new craft, Airbus stockpiles a lot of single-core processors, meanwhile the manufacturer also owns its own clean rooms and component manufacturing facilities to build some of these rare computing parts. “We’re working with some of the chip manufacturers on getting multi-core certified for flight, but there are a lot of hoops and we represent a small part of the market compared with smartphones,” he says. “It’s supply and demand.”

Big data While on-board software aids in aircraft operations, the planes are also fitted with thousands of sensors which store information. An Airbus 320 takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world. Every 30 minutes they generate 1TB of information – that’s a lot of terabytes Simon Bradley, Airbus Group “If you fly from London to Paris, typically you’ll be on an Airbus 320 small family aircraft. One of those takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world. Every 30 minutes they generate 1TB of information – that’s a lot of terabytes,” says Bradley. Gathering this volume of data helps Airbus manage fleet maintenance, predict weather patterns, plan efficient routes and maximise flight efficiency. While some information gets transmitted back to base while in flight, the majority of maintenance information isn’t considered a priority and is gathered as the plane approaches the gate. Using this information, Airbus can look at a specific part that will soon need replacing, say in three months’ time, and can find out in advance where that plane is going to be so the part can be shipped to the designated airport. This use of data is called predictive maintenance. Airbus also uses predictive maintenance for its defence and space craft. “The interesting big data challenges are not in the production, but the design of a product,” says Bradley. “If you want to change the shape of a wing or helicopter body, it traditionally takes two to three days to recompute all of the design parameters. We’re looking at new mathematical algorithms to reduce that to 30 minutes.” Many airlines recognise the benefits of a big data strategy, according to Bradley.

Customer experience Meanwhile, airlines are also using big data to improve passengers’ journey through the airport and provide them with information about their flight. “Quite a few people don’t bother with boarding cards, using their smartphones instead,” notes Bradley. “Five years ago, that concept didn’t exist, but BA now shows where I’ve flown in the past 10 years, how many times, where I’m going – it’s all about improving the customer experience.” Airbus is also concentrating on the customer experience factor, by researching how to create next-generation cabins at its innovation centre in Hamburg. Bradley says the company is looking to augmented reality to help improve the passenger experience, as well as lighting technologies to change the interior lights to match the time zone to reduce jet lag. “We’re also looking at state-of-the-art OLED screens for the side of the aircraft so you can look out and picture the destination you’re going to,” he says. “You could then use your tablet to find information. For example, if you’re flying to Singapore we could give you a tour projected onto the back of the seat in front of you.”"

Airbus has filed a patent for a new plane that looks decidedly more Star Trek Enterprise than airplane.

The Financial Times dubbed it ""flying doughnuts."" According to the patent application, the craft would address a long-standing problem for plane designers — pressurized cabins, which stress planes on the front and back ends and require heavy, reinforced frames.

The patent says the new design would distribute that pressure in a way that would be more ""economic and efficient.""

Airbus says the design also has an additional benefit: Seating passengers in a circle, doughnut-style, allows for more fliers than the old-fashioned paper-towel-holder-with-two-wings.

""An approximately cylindrical geometry limits possibilities for increasing the passenger carrying capacity of the aircraft,"" the patent says.

Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon, though, told NPR that the design is not currently in production — and may never be. Dubon says the company files more than 600 patents every year.

""Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use,"" he says.

Still, Dubon says, ""There are some very clever people here that have fantastic ideas. And who knows? Maybe one day they will come to light.""

"Airbus Aims to Boost Capacity, Quality with New Mobile Facility - Aviation Pros","Tue, 25 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbnByb3MuY29tL3Rvb2xzLWVxdWlwbWVudC9pbnN1cmFuY2UtZmluYW5jZS9haXJjcmFmdC9hcnRpY2xlLzExNzA2MjQzL2FpcmJ1cy1haW1zLXRvLWJvb3N0LWNhcGFjaXR5LXF1YWxpdHktd2l0aC1uZXctbW9iaWxlLWZhY2lsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Labeling the A320 family “the hottest-selling … in the industry,” Allan McArtor, chairman and CEO of Airbus Group Inc., says business in the airframer’s single-aisle arena is “disturbingly good” – so good that it faces a “huge backlog.”

Cutting that backlog – and improving quality – are key reasons Airbus opted to build a final assembly facility at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, the site of a former Air Force base. Airbus’ piece of the price is $600 million.

“We’ve got to get our capacity up,” says McArtor. “The Mobile assembly facility will allow us to increase our monthly rate on the [A320] family…significantly. It’s coming along exactly at the right time.”

Consider, as of August 2014 Airbus had booked firm orders for some 3,257 A320-family neos [new engine option] aircraft. That’s a significant slice of the 10,500-plus overall orders booked to date in a program first launched back in 1984.

Quantity drove Airbus to embrace the Gulf Coast. “We think it’s going to allow us to increase our market share in the U.S.,” says the man who oversees Airbus companies in the Americas. But the impetus for the move had more to it than that. “To be honest with you, we’re struggling with quality and on-time delivery in some of our European assembly facilities,” says McArtor. “We’re looking to Mobile to set a new standard for quality, and on-time deliveries.”

Construction of the facility is well underway on the shores of Mobile Bay. Plans are for assembly to begin in 2015, followed by delivery of Mobile-assembled aircraft in 2016. The goal is for four A320-family aircraft to roll off that assembly line per month by 2017.

That projection is predicated on the premise “that the supply chain can stay up” with demand says McArtor. In keeping with Airbus’ policy of spreading major component assembly (MCA) manufacturing among various countries, MCAs will be shipped to nearby docks abutting Mobile Bay – wings, fuselages, empennages, nose sections, and such. Then there are shipping containers packed with parts and engine pylons. The latter will be mated to the powerplants themselves close to the Brookley facility.

Slow, Measured Start-up

While the hot new A319, A320, and A321neos – with available fuel-efficient engine options of either Pratt & Whitney PW1100Gs or CFM LEAP1As – are dominating the order book just now, McArtor says Mobile will start out by producing traditional A320-family ceo, or current engine option, aircraft.

McArtor says Airbus is going that route “in order to make sure that the jigs and tools in Hamburg are mature for the neo … It’s not really a work force issue. It’s tooling. We don’t want to run the tooling for both ceo and neo” at the same time.

It appears the first craft off the Mobile line will be bound for nearby Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines. McArtor says the carrier recently increased its A320ceo order by 15 airplanes. “They’re to be delivered in 2017, and they want them out of Mobile.”

Plans are to finish the Delta order and then convert the line to an all-neo affair. McArtor thinks most of the subsequent aircraft will be the stretched A321 variant, and that they’ll sport fuel-saving ‘sharklet’ wingtips.

The 116-acre facility aims to be as efficient as possible, producing as many as 50 narrowbodies per year by 2018. One of the ways Airbus intends to do that is by eliminating a couple to station stops along the line says McArtor. The idea is to do “more precise, more efficient and high-quality work at each stop” along the final assembly line. Enabling that added quality, he says, is that “We’ll have better alignment tools available to us.”

The hoped-for result: the most efficient assembly process “in our entire global system,” asserts McArtor – this by virtue of incorporating lessons learned at other Airbus facilities.

Why Mobile?

Airbus has a history when it comes to Mobile. It was at Brookley that the airframer proposed to build its A330 tanker variant for the United States Air Force, a contract that ultimately went to Boeing. It thoroughly vetted Mobile’s proposal – geographically and demographically – before settling on Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley for the hoped-for tanker work. “We needed access to a deep-water port, as well as an airport,” says McArtor. The icing on the cake was that the seaport and airport were right next to one another.

After the tanker loss Airbus decided “not just to fold the tent” on future relationships with Mobile says McArtor. The idea was to “see what else we might be able to do” at the prime piece of Gulf Coast property. It took a year for the company to work up a business case for a single-aisle line at Brookley. The fact that the site would serve the largest single-aisle market on the planet, the United States, didn’t hurt. Nor did Mobile’s southern U.S. proximity to growing Latin American demand.

The Gulf Coast givith, and it taketh away – the latter often in spectacularly catastrophic fashion.

On September 12, 1979, Hurricane Frederic swept into normally placid Mobile Bay, producing winds in excess of 125 miles per hour and a storm surge of between 12 and 15 feet. Before it arrived, a half-million residents fled. By the time it departed billions of dollars in damage lay in its withering wake.

Airbus is not unaware of this. “Nothing’s hurricane-proof,” accedes McArtor. But, “We’re very comfortable with the fact that the facility and its infrastructure will be as solid as we can possibly make it.”

Airbus’ America’s chief believes the real risk lies less with the disruption the wind and tides wreak themselves as with what would happen with the work force.

Airbus intends to employ about 1,000 people at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. While McArtor insists, “the facility itself is very survivable,” he says worker access to Brookley, power supply and the infrastructure of the city itself in the wake of a hurricane could pose the biggest problems.

Such are the geographics. Demographically, Airbus is recruiting the lion’s share of its employees from the Gulf Coast. So far, competition has been keen. McArtor says there have been some 100 applicants for every job vacancy. “We were encouraged by the talent attracted to the automobile industry in Alabama.”

He contends, “The level of talent has been remarkable,” and not just when it comes to sheet metal folks. He notes that while some European Airbus people assumed highly skilled positions such as quality assurance engineer would have to go to European expatriates assigned to America, “To their surprise” they discovered the southeastern regional talent pool in the U.S. contains not just applicants of comparable talents, “but probably better talent than [Airbus has at its facilities] in Hamburg and Toulouse.”

Most of the Mobile jobs require experience, and that – so far – Airbus hasn’t had any problems in filling positions. Down the road it’s working with Alabama Industrial Training, or ADIT to keep the talent flow going. “They’ve created a training facility on-site [at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley]. “It’s a beautiful facility for skills training,” says McArtor. “And they have a relationship with junior colleges and vocational/technical schools.”

Geography, demography, and an insistent demand for more airplanes. Allan McArtor and Airbus believe they auger well. “The [Mobile] program’s got legs,” he says. “It will be around for a long time.”"
Airbus wins Delta wide-body order - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMS8xOS9haXJidXMtd2lucy1kZWx0YS13aWRlLWJvZHktb3JkZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has won the hotly-contested competition for 50 wide-body airplanes, two sources tell Leeham News and Comment.

Airbus will sell Delta 25 A350-900s and 25 A330-900s, our sources say. Rolls-Royce is the sole-source engine supplier.

Boeing hoped to sell Delta the 787-9 and also offered five new 777-200LRs as bridge lift until delivery slots for the 789 were available, according to our information.

Losing is a major disappointment for Boeing, not only because of the sheer number of wide-body airplanes involved but also because this is one of the Big Three US carriers; and there was the slim chance Delta might take Boeing up on the 777LR order, which would help fill the struggling production gap for the 777 Classic.

For Airbus, winning Delta is a major coup for many of the same reasons: the sheer size of the deal, Delta’s status and, while the A330neo order won’t help the A330ceo’s production gap, this gives a good boost to the neo program and adds a prestigious name to the customer list.

According to our information, Boeing couldn’t find early delivery slots for the 789–hence the offer of the 777LR–but Airbus was able to move the A350 skyline around enough to provide the airplane early.

The A359 is intended for the Pacific and the A339 for the Atlantic. Delta is building up a major international hub at Seattle, where some of these airplanes will fly from.

Airbus told LNC, “We do not comment on rumor or speculation concerning discussions with our customers.” Boeing declined comment.

Delta did not respond to a request for comment. Delta’s plan was to announce this at Investors’ Day on December 11.

In the hotly contested sales battle between the world preeminent airplane makers — Boeing and Airbus — Delta's monster order is a huge victory for the Europeans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Delta's order includes 25 next-generation A350-900XWB and 25 upgraded A330-900neo widebody airliners to replace the airline's current fleet of Boeing 747-400 and 767-300ER jets.

In fact, this week's order marks the second major Airbus order placed by Delta in the span of 14 months. Last September, the Atlanta-based carrier ordered 40 Airbus jets, including 10 international widebody A330-300 and 30 large domestic narrow body A321 jets.

For a long-time operator of American-built Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed aircraft, Delta seems to have hitched the future of its long-haul fleet to the European Airbus bandwagon — which is a major blow for Boeing.

In recent years, Delta has built a solid reputation for being the consummate value shopper in the airline industry — opting to buy affordable secondhand aircraft instead of investing billions in new ones.

Think of it this way: Delta has been the guy trying to buy used iPhone 4Ss on ebay for $80.00 when others are forking over hundreds on the iPhone 6.

But this week's order is like that same person pre-ordering the latest smartphone weeks before its debut.

So does this massive $14 billion dollar order mean Scrooge McDelta has abandoned its long-held frugality?

Not quite. Here's why.

Delta's Widebody Fleet Is Ancient

A Delta Boeing 767. Wikipedia

Among America's three remaining legacy carriers — American, Delta, and United — Delta has, by far, the oldest fleet, according to Airfleets.net. While United and American's aircraft are on average between 12-13 years old, Delta's fleet is just under 17 years old. This is especially the case for Delta's large widebody planes that fly passengers across the ocean.

Today, the airline's long haul duties are primarily the responsibility of its fleet of Boeing 747, 767, 777, and Airbus A330 wide bodies with narrow-body Boeing 757s pressed into service for long-range trips, as well.

Of the planes in Delta's long-haul fleet, this week's order will replace its collection of ""college age"" Boeing 747-400 and 767-300ERs. Delta's 13 747 jumbo jets were inherited from Northwest Airlines after the companies merged in 2008. They're 22 years old, on average. Delta's fleet of twin-engine 767-300ERs are an average of 18.5 years old.

For the airline, a fleet of aging planes require more thorough maintenance and hundreds of millions of dollars of extra fuel annually. While for the passengers, they tend to translate into fewer modern amenities and a louder, less serene ride.

Fortunately for Delta, its nearly 800 aircraft fleet provide a certain level of flexibility when a plane does break down. In addition, the airline has the best maintenance operation in the business, AirwaysNews senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider.

Fuel Economy Matters

During the 2000s, when Delta needed to upgrade its domestic fleet of older Boeing 727 and DC-9 aircraft, the airline bought used instead of new. As other airlines at the time spent billions to order hundreds of brand new fuel efficient Boeing 737s and Airbus A320 series aircraft to serve as the backbone of their domestic fleets, the used airplane market became flooded with older, but still very capable, MD80/90 series airliners. Delta snapped them up at a very low price.

""Delta identified— at that time — used aircraft were incredibly undervalued,"" Bhaskara said. ""They realized they could get many years of service out of those for cheap.""

So why can't Delta follow the same strategy to replenish its widebody fleet?

After all, in the months leading up to Delta's latest announcement, there were rumors circulating about the airline acquiring a number of secondhand Boeing 777-200s that were being retired by middle-east and Asian carriers — for a very affordable price.

The answer to this question is fuel economy, says Bhaskara. The MD80/90s are cheap to acquire but their older generation engines and aerodynamics make them gas guzzlers. Since fuel is any airline's number one expense, fuel economy matters. Delta is able to get away with flying gas guzzling MD jets because they operate on shorter routes.

However, on long distance routes, fuel economy become more challenging for older planes cautions Bhaskara. Even at bargain basement prices, the next generation avionics, engines, and aerodynamics of the A350, Boeing Dreamliner, and even the A330neo make them a better long-term prospect than a used 777.

Delta Got Costco-Sized Discounts

With a reported catalogue price of $14.3 billion, this is the priciest airplane order in Delta's recent history. However, it is highly unlikely the airline paid anywhere near that much. Delta, like most major airlines, probably recieved discounts ranging from 30-50% off the sticker price, Bhaskara said. Other analysts agree. The Seattle Times reported that aviation valuation firm Avitas put the actual sale price of the 50 Airbus jets at $6.2 billion.

Boeing's Dreamliner Is Sold Out

When Delta announced that it would buy a new fleet of long-range widebody jets, it also said the airline would need to take delivery in 2017 or 2018. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been selling like hotcakes. It's production slots for the next few years are completely filled. Which means Delta could not have received delivery of a fleet of Dreamliners in the time frame the airline requires.

According to Reuters, this may have tipped the balance towards Airbus in this deal: ""Airbus emerged as the front-runner in part after it became clear its revamped A330neo could be delivered earlier than Boeing's temporarily sold-out 787 Dreamliner."""
China sets its sights on breaking the Boeing-Airbus duopoly - The Conversation Indonesia,"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9jaGluYS1zZXRzLWl0cy1zaWdodHMtb24tYnJlYWtpbmctdGhlLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtZHVvcG9seS0zNDE4MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global civil aerospace market has long been a classic duopoly. The sector has been dominated by European company Airbus and the US giant Boeing, with only limited competition in the regional jet market from Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil.

But this could be set to change now that China’s state plane maker, Comac, is speeding up its efforts to launch a commercial passenger aircraft.

A market winner

Comac, with funding from China Merchants Bank, is manufacturing C919 single-aisle commercial jets with a view to achieving first flight in 2015 and first customer deliveries in 2018. At the recent Zhuhai Airshow in China, Comac announced 430 orders from 17 clients for the 168-seat C919, with additional pledges for another 23 of its ARJ21-700 passenger jets, including its first order from Africa.

These orders will make Comac’s new aircraft more attractive to the Chinese market. This will be crucial, given the expectation by both Airbus and Boeing that China will become the world’s largest aircraft manufacturing centre within two decades, as well as the world’s fastest-growing aviation market with a surge in travellers fuelling the expansion. And so Comac poses a clear challenge to Airbus and Boeing’s long-term future in China, where they have already been hotly competing for business.

The ultimate aim will be to supply the lucrative international market too. Forecasts predict that the global civil aerospace market could see demand for around 27,000 new commercial airliners by 2031, with an additional 24,000 regional business jets and 40,000 of smaller, rotary-wing aircraft. Altogether the burgeoning market is expected to exceed US$4.5 trillion over this period, with around half of the new demand coming from emerging economies, including China and India.

A long time coming

China has long been poised to offer new international competition in civil aerospace. In the latest Five Year Plan, which sets out the country’s direction of development, the government expressed a commitment to growing the commercial aerospace sector with investment already exceeding $9bn.

But it has taken China time to develop the expertise to enter this market. The basic technological knowledge was built up through offset agreements that were negotiated between major Western aerospace companies and their Chinese subcontractors. Entry into the high-potential Chinese aerospace market for Western companies was impossible without adopting Chinese partners and these agreements inevitably meant that crucial knowledge transfer took place from prime contractors to Chinese suppliers.

By 2010, China had secured sufficient knowledge and expertise to enter the commercial aircraft market on its own terms and also on an internationally competitive basis. Initially, it will operate in the more competitive regional jet market with its new aircraft, the 168 seat C919 manufactured by Comac. This not only provides immediate competition for Boeing’s 737 aircraft but also offers a foundation on which to build future global competition in medium-to-large-bodied aircraft in the 2020s.

Economic logic

By far the most important explanation for Chinese success in this sector is the capacity to maintain low production costs. Chinese manufacture means potentially higher transportation costs, additional supply chain and management complexity, and considerable risk of supply disruption. Despite these potential extra cost elements, the actual cost of manufacturing aircraft structures (body panels, wings and so on) is 20-25% lower than in the West. Much of this is down to to labour costs which are three to five times lower, which also makes China a desirable place to conduct maintenance and repair work on aircraft.

These cost advantages are only just being explored in China in the aerospace industry and that sector has much to learn from successful experience in automobiles and electronics. In aircraft, for example, just 3% of global aircraft manufacturing currently emanates from these low cost areas compared with 33% in automobiles and 85% for electronics.

Chinese suppliers already manufacture structural components for Airbus and Boeing and fuselages for Bombardier. The Chinese are about to handle the final assembly of the A320 and will doubtless gain much from the experience. And they also have aircraft building experience from their role in developing the Embraer ARJ21 regional jet for the Chinese market.

Essentially, the new entrant to the aerospace manufacturing global market has all the key elements it needs for success – a dedicated government, large funds, opportunities for economies of scale in development and in manufacturing, and, through its long liaison with Western companies, the capability to design, build and market globally competitive aircraft."
Airbus Might Face Higher Costs on Delayed Military Transport Plane (Published 2014) - The New York Times,"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTQvMTEvMTUvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9haXJidXMtbWlnaHQtZmFjZS1oaWdoZXItY29zdHMtb24tYTQwMG0tY2FyZ28tcGxhbmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The Airbus Group warned Friday that the costs associated with a much-delayed military transport plane could increase after the European aerospace giant failed to meet a deadline for equipping the aircraft with combat capabilities.

Airbus said the latest production snag involving the A400M Atlas cargo plane — which cost 20 billion euros, or $25 billion, to develop — risked adding to the €4 billion in added expenses that the group has already absorbed since 2006.

“I cannot rule out that there is a charge” in the fourth quarter, Harald Wilhelm, the company’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts. “We are still assessing it, but our target remains to avoid any incremental charge.”

Mr. Wilhelm said that Airbus had failed to meet a Nov. 1 target date for making ready certain unspecified combat features on the planes, a factor that, according to the original sales contracts, would entitle government customers to cancel some or all of their orders."
Delta confirms it's going with Airbus in big 50-jet order - USA TODAY,"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMTEvMjAvcmVwb3J0cy1kZWx0YS1zcHVybnMtYm9laW5nLXBpY2tzLWFpcmJ1cy1mb3ItNTAtamV0LW9yZGVyLzE5MzE4NTM3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta confirms it's going with Airbus in big 50-jet order

Delta will go with Airbus in deal for 50 wide-body jets that would be worth more than $14 billion at list prices. The Wall Street Journal calls the order ""a big victory for the European company in its battle with Boeing to sell long-range passenger aircraft.""

Delta said it will buy 25 Airbus A350-900 jets and 25 Airbus A330-900neo jets. Those aircraft would have a list price of about $14.3 billion, though big airlines receive significant discounts on such orders. The order comes after Delta announced in April that it was planning an order for wide-body long-haul jets to replace its older Boeing 747-400 and 767-300ER models.

""Delta always approaches fleet decisions with a balance of economic efficiency, customer experience enhancements, network integration and total cost of ownership,"" Nat Pieper, Delta's VP - Fleet Strategy and Transactions, says in a statement. ""The A350 and A330neo support our long-haul, transoceanic strategy and join a mix of Boeing and Airbus aircraft that provide exceptional flexibility for Delta's global network as well as strong cash-on-cash returns for our shareholders.""

Delta says the A350s will fly ""primarily on long-range routes between the U.S. and Asia,"" where Delta expects the aircraft will give it ""a 20% improvement in operating cost per seat compared to the Boeing 747-400 aircraft they will replace."" Delta says it will take delivery of its first A350 in the second quarter of 2017.

As for the A330neos, Delta says they'll ""be deployed on medium-haul trans-Atlantic markets as well as select routes connecting the U.S. West Coast and Asia. The aircraft are scheduled to enter the Delta fleet in 2019 and will deliver a 20% operating cost savings per seat over the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft it will replace.""

News of the deal was first reported by Leeham Co. analyst Scott Hamilton via his Leeham News and Comment blog. Leeham describes the deal as ""a major disappointment for Boeing"" and ""a major coup"" for Airbus.

Delta had been a strong Boeing customer in recent decades. On that front, Bloomberg News reminds that ""Boeing supported Delta's bankruptcy restructuring plan in 2007 in the face of a hostile takeover bid by US Airways.""

Still, Delta -- which inherited a number of Airbus models via its merger with Northwest -- broke with its Boeing trend in 2013, placing a major 40-jet deal with Airbus.

One of the items that apparently tipped the scales in favor of Airbus for this latest order was the early availability of its A330neo model, the updated version of the A330 that Airbus intends to roll out in 2017.

Reuters writes ""Airbus emerged as the front-runner in part after it became clear its revamped A330neo could be delivered earlier than Boeing's temporarily sold-out 787 Dreamliner ... .""

The Seattle Times picks up on that theme, saying ""Delta wants the A350s starting in 2017 and the A330neos two years later, Hamilton said in an interview. He said a decisive factor in the airline's choice was that Airbus was able to offer early delivery slots, but Boeing couldn't.""

Boeing has about 850 outstanding orders for the Dreamliners, and is moving to increase its production levels to meet the demand.

The Times notes that when Delta CEO Richard Anderson was asked in June about the looming widebody order, he said then that ""we really need deliveries around 2017, 2018."""

It's been drawn up by listed inventors Patrick Lieven, Romain Delahaye, and Catalin Perju, who propose an aircraft with a cabin that ""extends over 360 degrees around a space defined outside structure"".

The shape tackles a problem in the airline industry. Cylindrical shapes are better at dealing with pressurised cabins, but at the front and back of these structures there needs to be strong reinforcements to counter stresses, the FT writes. The circle alleviates this issue.

Airbus says it invests around €2 billion every year in its research and development, and submits more than 500 patent applications every year. Although its patented the UFO-like design this year, it probably won't be put into motion anytime soon.

But the company, which has a fleet of more than 600 planes, has lots of other futuristic projects in the works. In a statement, Airbus talks about a ""whole new way to fly"", discussing its Airbus Concept Plane and ""radical Airbus Concept Cabin"". Look at what the cabin could actually look like:

The company wants to improve flight times, reduce aircraft emissions, and better preserve energy sources. It says gliding capabilities, 3D printing, and even holographic technology could all one day be used in its planes.

Airbus appears set to deliver the first Airbus A350 to launch customer Qatar Airways in mid-December, according to Dubai-based Gulf News.

Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said on Tuesday ""everything is perfect"" with the A350 and that he expected delivery of the widebody jet between Dec. 12 and Dec. 15.

Al Baker's optimistic take on the A350's readiness suggests the delivery is likely to remain on schedule. That was not the case when Qatar Airways took delivery of its first Airbus A380, when Al Baker refused delivery on concerns about the quality of the interior. That led to a three-month delivery delay.

""We are a very quality airline and we will not accept any short cuts by any manufacturer,"" Al Baker said this week about the A380 delay, according to The National newspaper of Dubai. ""It cost us nearly three months from June to October. In revenue it would be $200 million.""

As for the A350, Qatar Airways will be the first in the world to get the jet, the newest commercial passenger aircraft to be made by European jetmaker Airbus.

The A350 – along with Airbus' recently announced update to its A330 widebody – is expected to help Airbus ratchet up competition against U.S. rival Boeing in the long-haul market, where Boeing's 777 and 787 ""Dreamliner"" models have enjoyed strong sales. Both the A350 and Boeing's 787 are revolutionary models, manufactured with the use of carbon-composite fibers.

Once the date is finalized, the delivery of Qatar Airways' first A350 will come at Airbus' Toulouse factory in southern France. Al Baker has already said Qatar Airways plans to first put its first A350s into commercial service on flights between Frankfurt and Doha.

Qatar Airways' A350s will have 283 seats, with 36 in business class and 247 in coach. The Doha-based airline has ordered 80 A350s and expects to have eight in its fleet by the end of 2015."
New radar ensures superiority of the Eurofighter - Airbus,"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNC0xMS1uZXctcmFkYXItZW5zdXJlcy1zdXBlcmlvcml0eS1vZi10aGUtZXVyb2ZpZ2h0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

New capabilities and improved protection of pilots

Captor-E radar on the Eurofighter

The Eurofighter will be equipped with a new generation of radar which will enhance the aircraft’s capabilities and substantially improve the pilots’ ability to survive. During a meeting of the defence state secretaries of the Eurofighter nations (Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain) held in Edinburgh, representatives of Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH and NETMA (NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency) signed a 1 billion euro contract to develop a new, electronically scanned radar, the so-called “Captor-E”.

Airbus Defence and Space is playing a major role in the development and integration of the radar, via its Military Aircraft and Electronics business lines. “Together with our partners in the Euroradar consortium we are developing the world’s most powerful fighter radar,” said Thomas Müller, head of the Electronics business line at Airbus Defence and Space. “This order will ensure ongoing development of radar technology, which is a core military capability in Germany.”

Berndt Wünsche, head of Combat Aircraft at Airbus Defence and Space, stated in Edinburgh: “This decision ensures that the Eurofighter will continue to be the best combat aircraft available in the world. The Captor-E radar will open up completely new options for deployment and will substantially improve the Eurofighter’s export opportunities.”

The main advantage of the Captor-E is its ability to perform several tasks practically simultaneously. This means that the pilot is able to scan a wide area in front of the aircraft or on the ground, while identifying ground targets or tracking individual flying objects at the same time. The new technology enables an increased range in target acquisition and target tracking and, thanks to the rotating antenna, a considerably larger field of view, compared to other state-of-the-art combat aircraft.

The new radar is being developed by Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH and the Euroradar consortium comprising Selex ES (Great Britain, Italy), Indra (Spain) and Airbus Defence and Space (Germany). The consortium has already developed and produced more than 400 Captor radars.

The proposed aircraft -- tentatively called the C929 -- would be state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC)'s largest, according to suppliers that have held discussions with the firm.

It would be a substantial advance on the smaller 158-168 seat narrow-body C919 it is currently developing and the 78-90 seat ARJ21 regional jet, which is undergoing test flights.

The goal is for the C929 -- which could carry several hundred passengers at a time on journeys across Asia -- to take flight after 2020, possibly in 2023.

COMAC's ambitions will be on parade at China's premier airshow, which opens Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai, with a huge stand highlighting the C919 and a flying display by a prototype ARJ21.

The technological challenges for China to build its own passenger plane are formidable, with some comparing them to the difficulty of sending a mission to the moon.

But the government considers developing a passenger aircraft industry a national priority that would vault it into an elite club of just a handful of nations.

At the same time Russia has drawn closer to its ally China in the face of Western sanctions over Ukraine and following two years of discussions, the two countries signed an agreement in May to develop what Chinese state media call the ""big plane.""

COMAC's strategic partner for the C929 is Russia's United Aircraft Corp., created in 2006 when Moscow combined the assets of the country's largest state-owned aircraft manufacturers, which have decades of experience.

""Russia and China have been working together, figuring out things, now they're ready to start talking and getting ideas from suppliers,"" said Briand Greer, president of aerospace for Asia-Pacific for U.S. firm Honeywell (IW 500/33) (HON), which already provides components and systems for both the C919 and ARJ21.

COMAC is floating ideas about the design of the plane ahead of making formal information requests to prepare a tendering process, industry sources said.

""We have been talking about this new project, the 929,"" said another supplier to the C919, who declined to be named.

""They have started with design of the plane. They are talking beyond 2020 (for the launch),"" he said.

One possibility for the wide-body -- which has two passenger aisles -- is a plane capable of flying within Asia for journeys of up to about five hours, industry officials said, but not for lengthy intercontinental flights of 12 to 14 hours.

'National Agenda'

Such a concept would compete with the planned regional version of the Airbus A330, they said, which will enter service early next year. Planes in the A330 family hold 200-400 passengers.

Boeing's wide-body offerings include its 767 and 787.

COMAC did not respond to requests for comment.

China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's wife and a member of the notorious ""Gang of Four,"" personally backed the attempt to develop the Y-10. Only three of the lumbering planes were ever built.

But with its deep pockets China can now tap foreign companies, some of them already suppliers to Boeing and Airbus.

The C919, which has a range of up to 3,444 miles, is scheduled to make its first test flight at the end of next year, with deliveries planned for 2018, according to state media, although some doubt the company will meet the target.

""It's a national agenda, it's going to happen,"" Greer said of the C919. ""Timing -- we'll see.""

Its engines are made by CFM International, a venture between France's Safran group (IW 1000/219) and General Electric (IW 500/7) (GE). COMAC has 400 orders for the C919, most from domestic customers with the exception of GE Capital Aviation Services -- a subsidiary of GE.

The ARJ21 regional jet claims 253 orders but the project is years behind schedule, with deliveries originally due in 2009.

COMAC plans to certify the ARJ with China's own civil aviation authority before year-end but approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is necessary before it can fly in most countries.

The C919 has just started being assembled at a sprawling complex next to Shanghai's Pudong Airport, where workers in blue uniforms fit together pieces of the fuselage, industry officials and media reports say.

Elsewhere on the vast tract of land, COMAC planners have already reserved space for a yet-unbuilt factory to house the C929.

The A330 MRTT has won every major tanker aircraft procurement competition outside the USA since it has entered the market.

Airbus Defence and Space has been selected by the French Ministry of Defence to supply 12 A330 MRTT new generation air-to-air refuelling aircraft for the French Air Force. The first delivery is foreseen for 2018, followed by the second in 2019, and then at a rate of one or two per year. According to the French ministry of Defense the contract amount is about 3 billion euros. The French Air Force chose to name the new aircraft“Phoenix”.

According to Airbus, the contract agreed between the French procurement agency (DGA) and Airbus Defence and Space is now ready for official award. The contract covers the development and qualification of the specific French configuration as well as the associated support and training systems, such as spares, ground support equipment, training devices and five years of in-service support from first delivery.

The A330 MRTT has won every major tanker aircraft procurement competition outside the USA since it has entered the market. France’s choice of the A330 MRTT makes it the sixth nation to order the type following Australia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom which have ordered a total of 34 aircraft. In addition, India and Qatar have selected the MRTT and are in the final stages of contractual negotiations for six and two aircraft respectively. A total of 22 aircraft are currently in service and the aircraft has been battle-proven in recent coalition actions.

In French service the A330 MRTT will replace the KC-135F currently operated by the French Air Force. The A330 will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, and be equipped with a combination of the Airbus Refuelling Boom System and underwing hose-and-drogue refuelling pods. It will be configured in a variety of layouts carrying up to 271 passengers or flying MEDEVAC or medical treatment arrangements, including the French MORPHEE intensive care module carrying up to ten patients as well as 88 passengers."
Frontier Adds to the Herd with Order of Nine Airbus A321 Aircraft - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDE0LzExL2Zyb250aWVyLWFkZHMtaGVyZC1vcmRlci1uaW5lLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLWFpcmNyYWZ0LzM3MjM00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frontier Airlines is continuing its development into an ultra-low cost carrier with an order of nine Airbus A321 aircraft. Known for their animal adorned tail flashes, this is Frontier’s first order of the largest member of the A320 family.

Frontier started its transition to an all-Airbus fleet in 2001 and currently operates a fleet of 35 A319 and 20 A320 aircraft. It also has 89 Airbus single aircraft on order, including 80 A320neo aircraft.

It really isn’t that surprising to see Frontier utilize the A320 family of aircraft as it competes in the low cost sector of the airline industry. The success of JetBlue alone has demonstrated the incredible versatility and utility of this family of aircraft when it comes to offering low fares on a plane that still provides a quality flight experience.

“We continue to come back for more A320 Family aircraft because they fulfill our mission of providing low fares through low operating costs,” said David Siegel, Frontier Airlines CEO. The A321 is a natural fit with our unique brand of Low Fares, Done Right and will continue to help meet our customers’ expectations for a safe and reliable travel experience while allowing us to provide low fare service to more of the country.”

Adding the A321 to its fleet gives Frontier an aircraft option with an increased seating capacity as well as additional range as it continues to develop its position in the ultra-low cost sector. With the announcement last week that Frontier will be reducing the number of flights that operate into and out of Denver, these new aircraft will open up opportunities to focus operations in areas that are less centralized than its Denver hub.

The A321 offers a seating capacity of up to 220, which is comparable to many widebody aircraft while maintaining the Airbus standard of at least 18-inch wide seats. This increased capacity as compared to the A319 (156 seats) and A320 (180 seats) allow the A321 to offer the best seat mile costs of any single-aisle aircraft.

Ultra-low cost carriers operate on such razor thin margins that they must maximize their efficiency in every way possible, so acquiring the A321 only makes sense. It will be interesting to see where exactly these aircraft go into service and how they aid Frontier as their operations become less focused on Denver and move to less centralized locations.

The engine option and seating configuration that Frontier will utilize were not part of the announcement.

Delta's Choice of the A330neo and A350 For Its Widebody Fleet May Seem a Little Peculiar – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMTQvMTEvMjUvZGVsdGFzLWNob2ljZS1vZi10aGUtYTMzMG5lby1hbmQtYTM1MC1mb3ItaXRzLXdpZGVib2R5LWZsZWV0LW1heS1zZWVtLWEtbGl0dGxlLXBlY3VsaWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We’ve been waiting a long time for Delta to decide what widebodies it would order to replace its 747s and 767s, and now we finally know. The A330-900neo and the A350-900 have both been chosen. That’s kind of strange considering they have nearly the same capacity, but as always, there is a method to Delta’s madness.

Twenty-five A350-900s are being bought to replace the 747s in the fleet (moment of silence, please). Delta has already started retiring those, and we know that the airline feels there’s too much capacity out there. So it’s going smaller. The A350-900 should seat around 315 in a typical configuration, and it can fly 7,500 nautical miles (nm). Today, Delta’s 747s carry 376 people and can fly about 6,500nm. So the A350 gives better range but carries fewer people. That’s exactly what Delta wants. This airplane will be used to fly primarily US-Asia routes, as the 747 does today.

Twenty-five A330-900neos are going to replace the 767-300s in the fleet, at least internationally. These airplanes usually seat 310 people (only 5 fewer than the A350-900) and will go about 6,200nm. Meanwhile, Delta’s international 767-300s seat between 208 and 226 today. They also fly between 5,400 and 5,700nm at most. This is going to be used to fly from the US to Europe, so mostly shorter-haul international operations. There could be some west coast-Asia flying as well. In this case, Delta is looking to add a lot of seats to what it has today but it doesn’t need the range of the A350.

What could Boeing have offered? Well, there’s the 787-10 which would seat about 10 more people or the 787-9 which is just a bit smaller. The first strike on the 787-10 is that first delivery isn’t scheduled until 2018. The 787-9 is flying but has a hefty backlog. Delta wanted airplanes sooner with the A350 coming in 2017. The second strike? It’s one airplane to fill two roles, unlike the Airbus offering.

I was told by a wise fleet planner that you should only buy the range you need. Otherwise, you’re wasting your money. For European flying, 6,200nm is plenty. In fact, a route like LA to Amsterdam doesn’t even crack 5,000nm. So why buy more airplane than you need? Well, the A350 is going to be more fuel efficient than the A330neo. Or at least it should be since it’s a brand new design. But that’s where purchase price comes into play.

Delta is the first to place a firm order for the A330-900neo, and you know Airbus wanted to get one of those on the books. I have no doubt that Delta got a smoking deal on those airplanes. They’ll still be vastly superior to the 767 in terms of operating economics, but they won’t be the most fuel efficient in the sky. I chuckled when I saw Delta call the A330-900neo “advanced” while the A350-900 was called “state-of-the-art.” Still, the lower purchase price must have made it worthwhile. That’s certainly consistent with Delta’s narrowbody decisions as well.

Meanwhile, for Asia flying, that extra range starts to become more important. Detroit to Hong Kong is 6,800nm, for example. You need those longer legs for Pacific flying, and so the A330-900neo just wasn’t really an option.

It looks like Delta’s needs here were in a little sweet spot of an area that the twin options from Airbus could fill nicely. Combine that with a great price, and Airbus was the winner here.

This all makes sense to me, though you have to wonder how the people in Delta’s burgeoning Seattle hub feel about the decision. Maybe we’ll see Alaska kick up it’s “proudly all-Boeing” marketing message to try to increase its advantage in the market. Or maybe, as is most likely, nobody will care. Delta had to make the right decision to meet its financial and operational needs here. I’m guessing that’s exactly what’s happened.

[Edit to reflect the 787-9 as a comparable option, not just the 787-10.]

Airbus Helicopters Photo

Airbus Helicopters has handed over the first of six EC725 rotorcraft acquired by Indonesia for combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) missions. Present at Airbus Helicopters’ Marignane, France facility to accept the aircraft included members of the Indonesian Ministry of Defence, the Indonesian Air Force, as well as PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI). The 11-ton twin-engine helicopter will be delivered to the Air Force by mid-2015 after PTDI completes the mission equipment outfitting and customization at its Bandung, West Java facility.

“We are pleased to receive this first EC725 from Airbus Helicopters, which will allow us to complete it in the CSAR version to be handed over to the Indonesian Air Force,” said PTDI president Budi Santoso. “We will continue to work closely with Airbus Helicopters to ensure the on-time delivery of the remaining units, as we anticipate an additional order from the Air Force for 10 more EC725s to complete its squadron of 16 helicopters.”

When deployed by the Indonesian Air Force, the EC725 fleet will significantly enhance the military service’s CSAR capabilities, benefitting from the proven performance and durability of Airbus Helicopters’ latest member in its Super Puma helicopter family.

The mission equipment integration and completion of these six EC725 will mark a new step in Airbus Helicopters’ well-established cooperation with PTDI, which includes a strategic industrial agreement and the Indonesian company’s role in Airbus Helicopters’ global supply chain.

The Indonesian Air Force has been a long-time operator of both the AS332 Super Puma and SA330 Puma rotorcraft, which were license-produced by PTDI since over 30 years ago. The partnership between PTDI and Airbus Helicopters has continued to grow, resulting in PTDI becoming a key supplier of tail booms and airframe assemblies of the EC225 and EC725 since 2008.

“Airbus Helicopters’ cooperation with PT Dirgantara Indonesia is exemplary,” said Philippe Monteux, head of region South East Asia and Pacific at Airbus Helicopters. “Our delivery of the first EC725, with significant parts being first built by PTDI, underscores how our partnership continues to evolve, meeting Indonesia’s helicopter needs and further contributing to the progress of its aerospace sector.”

The EC725 entered service in 2005 and has already been selected by the military forces of France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Its reliability and capabilities have been confirmed in crisis areas that include Lebanon, Afghanistan and Mali, while also supporting

France’s role during NATO-led operations in Libya. Missions performed by EC725s range from combat search and rescue to special operations, tactical transport and medical evacuation, along with a full range of maritime roles."

Airbus Helicopters’ newest lightweight military multi-role helicopter, the EC645 T2 (LUH SOF), has successfully completed its first flight. In the presence of representatives of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), which has ordered the first of this new helicopter type, the EC645 T2 demonstrated its capacities at the company’s Donauwörth location in Bavaria.

“This first flight is a milestone in the EC645 T2 program and we’re thrilled to be able to celebrate this event with our customer,” said Ralf Barnscheidt, head of the German Military Support Center. “We’re right on schedule to deliver the first EC645 T2 helicopters in the coming year. This is also a product of the close-knit collaboration between the Airbus Helicopters and Bundeswehr project teams.”

The EC645 T2 is the military version of the civil EC145 T2 that entered into service this past summer. With a maximum takeoff weight of 3.7 tons, the EC645 T2 can be used for a wide range of military operations including transportation, reconnaissance, search and rescue, fire support, and evacuations of wounded personnel. The Bundeswehr has ordered 15 of these helicopters for the German Air Force. The EC645 T2 represents a significant addition to the German Air Force’s capabilities and offers a host of features that make it particularly well suited to missions carried out by the Special Forces Command (KSK)."
Airbus logistics: from tiny fish to small whale – and now a bigger Beluga - Flightglobal,"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1mcm9tLXRpbnktZmlzaC10by1zbWFsbC13aGFsZS1hbmQtbm93LWEtYmlnZ2VyLWJlbHVnYS8xMTUxNzQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now that Airbus has pushed the “go” button to develop an A330-based successor to its fleet of five A300-600ST Beluga oversized transports, it’s a good time to look back on the critical role these distinctive aircraft have played in turning the dream of knitting French, German, Spanish and British aerospace manufacturers into a single company.

The ability to fly components such as fuselage sections, wings and tails for A320s, A330s and A350s to final assembly sites in Toulouse and Hamburg has allowed Airbus to treat far-flung centres of expertise as a coherent manufacturing system. The concept isn’t new – going back to the 1970s, Airbus subassemblies were flown to final assembly in a fleet of four “Super Guppies”, a converted type that is still used by NASA (pictured). But, given the limitations of the 1940s Boeing Stratocruisers on which they are based, Airbus’s requirements eventually outgrew the capabilities of these aircraft. The A300-600ST – ST for “Super Transport” – first flew in 1994 and entered service a year later, with five being built through 1999.

The success of the Beluga fleet can be seen in more than its having kept Airbus going, and growing, for nearly 20 years. During that time, Belugas operated by the Airbus Transport International subsidiary have been a significant force in oversized air transport. Notable cargoes have included several European-built sections of the International Space Station, delivered to Cape Canaveral for launch by Space Shuttle.

And in 1999, Airbus proposed a special cargo lifting system for the Beluga to meet the UK Royal Air Force’s Short Term Strategic Airlifter requirement. Beluga didn’t win the deal – Antonov An-124s were also considered and the RAF eventually leased four Boeing C-17 Globemasters – but the episode underscored both the capability and the ambition of the Beluga programme.

Ultimately, the logistical motivation behind the Airbus ST fleet presaged rival Boeing’s move to develop the 747-based “Dreamlifter” (below). In order to sustain 787 final assembly from large subassemblies, including complete fuselage barrels, oversized air freight was, so to speak, the only way to fly.

Boeing

But for Airbus, it was the A380 superjumbo that really put its best logistical minds to the test. Back in the late 1990s, when the double-decker was the yet-to-be-launched A3XX, Airbus realised that assembly of the aircraft posed a major challenge. Neither the wings nor the fuselage sections would fit in a Beluga, so the company – which was not yet formally consolidated as European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS) – had several options for assembly, none of them ideal. One was to work in smaller subassemblies, which could be flown by Beluga to the widebody assembly plant at Toulouse. But then Toulouse would have to do much more heavy assembly work than it was doing for A320s, A330s and A340s. That option also would include such challenges as building the fuselage sections in upper and lower halves for joining after delivery.

A second choice was to establish an all-new final assembly plant near the sea, so that the extra-large wings and fuselage sections could be shipped by boat. But that option left Toulouse – and hence Airbus’s existing widebody assembly expertise – out of the equation.

A hybrid solution was considered, as well. Airbus engineers worked out that it would be possible to fly A3XX wings on top of a modified A340, but that left fuselage barrels either in halves or transported by road from Bordeaux, the nearest place to Toulouse to where they could be shipped by sea. The problem with the hybrid solution lay especially in the road segment, which complicated plans to make the A3XX by a super-efficient, just-in-time supply mechanism.

In the end, the A380 solution was sea transport to Bordeaux with a road connection to Toulouse.

Today, the imminent ramp-up of A350 production and increasingly high rate demands of the A320 programme – as well as other needs such as the movement of A400M components – have led Airbus to the conclusion that, like the Super Guppy before it, the Beluga isn’t quite up to the task. The current Beluga fleet carries A350-900 fuselage sections, and is capable of handling the A350-1000, but Airbus faces other operational considerations; with output increasing, the transport fleet will have to fly more hours (around 10,000h/year from 2016, compared to about 6,000h today) and the Beluga fleet is getting more expensive to operate with age.

A340- and A330-300-based options were considered, but the “new Beluga” will be based on an A330-200, which will expand the diameter of the cargo bay by 1m, to about 8.1m, and make it 6m longer (illustration below). Payload will increase by 6t, to 53t. A Beluga-style lowered cockpit will remain a distinctive visual characteristic of the new aircraft, which will make “extensive” use of A330 components and equipment.

But what to call this new Super Transport? So far, Airbus logistics have relied on machines named after a small fish and a cetacean the size of a very large dolphin. Suggestions on a postcard, please.

On Apr. 6, 2011, Virgin America A320 named “My Other Ride is a Spaceship” flew beside Virgin Galactic’s WhiteKnightTwo carrying SpaceShipTwo over San Francisco to celebrate Virgin America’s new terminal at SFO airport.

The following footage was filmed from aboard the Airbus, as the “mothership” and an accompanying Beechcraft Baron 58 chase plane rejoined on the liner’s left wing, in a rendez-vous reminding that of the receivers on an aerial refueler, to take some cool images of the rather unusual formation.

With a service ceiling of 60,000 feet, the jet-powered cargo aircraft used to lift the SpaceShipTwo spacecraft to a release altitude of 50,000 feet, features two fuselage, one of those is an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo to allow tourist training.

On Oct. 31, during a first test over Mojave desert, SS2 disintegrated in flight, seconds after release from White Knight Two. Although the cause of the incident is still being investigated, NTSB team revealed that an uncommanded feather deployment occurred 9 sec. after ignition of the hybrid rocket, possibly overstressing the airframe until it collapsed.

Shown here is a Marine Nationale AS565. Marine Nationale Photo

The mission capabilities and cost effectiveness of Airbus Helicopters’ AS565 MBe Panther has been further validated by Indonesia’s order for 11 helicopters. The rotorcraft will be used in naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions.

Scheduled for deliveries within three years, the AS565 MBe helicopters will be supplied by Airbus Helicopters to PT Dirgantara Indonesia. Through the strategic industrial agreement between these two partners, PT Dirgantara Indonesia will be outfitting these rotorcraft in-country with mission equipment before delivery to the Indonesian Navy. The mission equipment include the Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS) dipping sonar and torpedo launching system – providing a truly effective mission system for operations from land bases and ships.

“The Panther now becomes one of the world’s most capable light/medium anti-submarine warfare platforms, with an advanced ASW suite and the capability to operate from corvettes or small frigates,” said Philippe Monteux, head of region South East Asia and Pacific at Airbus Helicopters. “This fully-capable, modern solution meets the naval requirements of Indonesia and other countries in the region, benefitting from our partnership with PT Dirgantara Indonesia and the industry’s best system suppliers.”

This order will add to the Indonesian Armed Forces’ fleet of Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft serving the country’s defense on land, at sea and in the air. The fleet includes the light EC120 Colibris for training; the Fennecs and BO-105 for light attack missions; the Panthers for anti-submarine warfare missions; and the Pumas and Super Pumas operated by the Air Force who will soon also receive the EC725 for combat search and rescue missions.

The agreements were secured by PT Dirgantara Indonesia as a result of its long-standing cooperation and strategic alliance with Airbus Helicopters. The president of PT Dirgantara Indonesia, Budi Santoso explained, “This latest contract demonstrates the strength and efficiency of our commercial and industrial partnership with Airbus Helicopters. Together, we are able to identify and deliver the most modern and cost-effective solutions for the Indonesian Government and at the same time associate the significant involvement of the Indonesian industry.”"

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - An industrial drumbeat is picking up in European aircraft factories as Airbus borrows a new range of carmaking strategies to keep pace with record demand.

Technologically, modern jetliners have more in common with a custom-built Formula 1 than a family saloon.

But their construction, and in particular the way 3 million parts per plane pour into factories, is getting a extra boost from cars as the jet age heads closer towards mass production.

The transformation underpins one of the toughest challenges faced by Airbus in its 44-year history: switching to a new model of best-selling A320 at the same time as embarking on a steep ramp-up for its new carbon-composite wide-bodied jet, the A350.

""Imagine building a skyscraper with 30 floors and over $100 million in value. Then imagine you are asked to ...deliver a skyscraper every day. In terms of value and complexity that is what A350 production is,"" Klaus Richter, the ex-BMW procurement chief who now oversees a $40 billion Airbus supply chain, said.

""A construction company would go crazy. You would have teams working on the lighting, and one week later, you would have three skyscrapers behind them waiting,"" he told Reuters.

Richter is drawing on experience in running one of the tightest auto supply chains to help Airbus in a new contest with its U.S. arch-rival Boeing, this time over production strategy.

While bulging order books have pushed up the share prices of both companies, their industrial war plans will determine investor returns and development cash for years to come and influence the fate of new entrants like China and Russia.

With up to 80 percent of manufacturing dollars spent externally, the supply chain is a crucial front in the battle.

In 1990, Airbus ordered 6 billion euros of parts a year. By 2020, its procurement bill is set to reach 50-60 billion euros.

""That illustrates how enormous the development has been over time and why we have to industrialize,"" Richter said, referring to the move from a ""workshop"" culture long on customisation towards higher volumes and the intuitive flow of an auto plant.

Story continues

To achieve this, Airbus is relying increasingly on 'series production' techniques as well as managers such as the tall and unflappable 50-year-old Richter and former Mercedes executive Gunter Butschek, the Airbus operations chief.

Boeing led the way in adopting just-in-time ""Lean Manufacturing"" inspired by Toyota in the 1990s and its coloured progress charts have become a common sight, including at Airbus.

But industry watchers say Airbus is now driving automotive techniques deeper into its organisation and spreading the transformation to the supply chain more widely than before.

""Airbus are doing better than they used to, and better than Boeing, in handling their supply chain right now,"" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of consultancy Teal Group.

A Boeing spokesman said it was studying ""a lot of supply chains"" and its cost-cutting ""Partnership for Success"" scheme would make its own chain more efficient, creating a ""competitive advantage for Boeing, our partners and our customers"".

DUAL SOURCING

A turning point in Airbus thinking came three years ago when missing wiring bundles from a strike-hit Tunisian plant threatened to bring A320 production to a halt, forcing managers to set up a makeshift plant in France over one weekend.

""Everyone was running like hell,"" Richter said.

Partly as a result, Airbus has decided to accelerate dual-sourcing for the single-aisle A320, and where needed to maintain backup facilities or limited buffer stocks, Richter said.

The changes do not end there.

Airbus is gradually changing its business model, even at the risk of displeasing some airlines, by moving towards less customisation, especially in the choice of cabin layout.

It has altered the way it deals with scrap by asking some suppliers to pre-machine parts and sharing more information with them to avoid sending shocks through the supply chain: a tool used by the car industry to manage its much higher volume.

""In automotive you find a lot of visibility and predictable demand for the supply chain to enable them to have a very high utilisation of capacity and adapt early on,"" Richter said.

Both Boeing, with its 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus, with its A400M military transporter, have had costly slowdowns in the past blamed on inadequate oversight of outside suppliers.

Of 3,000 suppliers on the A350, only about 200 are so-called Tier 1 firms dealing directly with Airbus, yet the $15 billion project is exposed to failure anywhere in the system.

Richter said there were few points of vulnerability or ""hot spots"" in the supply chain and parameters like on-time delivery, missing parts and quality had all improved ""significantly"".

""With that strategic preparation, we are pretty confident we can imagine the exceptions and the weak partners but these will be very limited,"" he said in the interview.

Even before the first A350 delivery due next month, Airbus is running its supply chain at the equivalent of 2-5 jets a month, half way towards an assembly goal of 10 a month by 2018.

RISKS AHEAD

Still, the margin for error is tight.

""You are running at near red-line capacity and if there is anything that throws things off, it can have a cascading effect through the supply chain,"" said former McKinsey & Co aerospace head Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of Lundquist Group.

Furthermore, the next three years will be crucial for Airbus, during which the A350 will be on a financial tightrope and the A320 must continue to finance the rest of the group.

With the A350 ramping to peak output quickly, any delay in reducing costs through experience could affect multiple planes.

""A large part of the learning-curve challenge is getting carbon-fibre production of the airframe and assembly up to speed in synchronisation with the supply chain,"" Richter said, adding the problem was ""understood and intensively managed.""

The A320's more modest revamp involves mainly new engines, but could place pressure on St Eloi, the oldest Airbus facility in Toulouse, where smooth production of the pylons attaching them to the wings is a critical part of the project.

It also leaves Airbus dependent on ambitous production targets of engine makers including Pratt & Whitney, although Richter was confident its parent United Technologies would prevent any major disruption.

""For United Technologies it is basically one business unit with one challenge and if needed they can support it massively to safeguard their ramp-up, and they will,"" he said.

HAMBLE-LE-RICE, United Kingdom--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Production of the wing fixed trailing edge package for Airbus’ A350-1000 jetliner has begun at GE Aviation, Hamble, marking a new milestone in the largest design and manufacture contract awarded in the 78-year history of this GE Aviation Aerostructures business.

The first element produced is a spoiler hinge bracket, which was manufactured today in GE Aviation’s machining facility at Hamble-le-Rice, United Kingdom.

GE Aviation, Hamble has full responsibility for designing and building the wing fixed trailing edge packages on the new A350-1000 variant and the in-production A350-900 version of Airbus’ twin-engine A350 XWB jetliner, comprising more than 3,000 deliverable components per aircraft – involving complex machined parts, structural composite panels and assemblies.

The A350-1000’s strengthened, higher performance wing will experience additional loads in flight, necessitating a high level of technical change and integration to the GE Aviation, Hamble-supplied wing fixed trailing edge package. It also involved coordination throughout the supply chain, and with the A350 XWB engineering plateau established by Airbus at its Filton, UK facility to ensure close and timely collaboration with other risk-sharing partners and agreement on all technical interface requirements.

GE Aviation, Hamble has been utilizing fully-integrated product development teams, visual management techniques, configuration and risk management processes, along with IT tool suites to meet the program’s lead times and delivery schedules. The experience gained with these best practices will be applied as appropriate through other GE Aviation, Hamble operations.

Supporting the A350 XWB engineering activities managed by GE Aviation, Hamble are the resources of its GE Aviation parent company, including satellite GE Engineering centers in Poland and India.

To meet the A350 XWB’s production volume and to accommodate the ramp-up in output rate planned by Airbus, GE Aviation, Hamble is expanding its capacity and refining efficiencies. This includes an all-new 9,000-square-meter composites production center, which is part of a site investment of more than US$50 million to support future manufacturing and new technology developments. The composites facility is well advanced in its construction, with its inauguration targeted for the third quarter of 2015.

The Indonesian Army has taken delivery of an Airbus Helicopters lightweight rotorcraft, the first in a fleet of 12 which will provide this military service with advanced capabilities in attack missions. Comprising six single-engine and six twin-engine versions, the helicopters are to be supplied through 2016.

These 12 rotorcraft from the Ecureuil/Fennec family will constitute an Indonesian Army light attack squadron. Based on Airbus Helicopters’ strategic industrial agreement with PT Dirgantara Indonesia, the mission equipment for the fleet – including machine guns and rocket launchers – will be installed by PT Dirgantara Indonesia at its in-country facilities in Bandung.

“These deliveries are aligned with our responsibilities from the Indonesian government to develop defense systems locally to augment the country’s defense capabilities,” said PT Dirgantara Indonesia president Budi Santoso.

The Fennec helicopter – being the militarized version of Airbus Helicopters’ renowned Ecureuil rotorcraft family – has been performing combat, combat support, tracking, escort and training duties around the world, including Asia. This series of adaptable single- and twin-engine helicopters combines powerful light attack capabilities with highly cost-effective airframe and mission system solutions.

“Indonesia’s acquisition of the Fennec demonstrates this helicopter family’s suitability for operations in a full range of conditions, providing a highly maneuverable and agile platform with low detectability,” said Philippe Monteux, head of region South East Asia and Pacific at Airbus Helicopters.

The Indonesian Army’s Fennec acquisition follows the Indonesian Air Force’s purchase of six EC725s in 2012. In the region, the Royal Thai Army also ordered a fleet of eight Fennecs for scouting missions in 2011.

PT Dirgantara Indonesia has a long-standing partnership with Airbus Helicopters for close to 40 years. It is the prime contractor for the Indonesian government in providing end-to-end services from helicopter sales, customization and completion to delivery and after-sales support on the full range of Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft. PT Dirgantara Indonesia is also part of Airbus Helicopters’ supply chain, manufacturing the EC225 and EC725 tail booms and airframe assemblies for the worldwide market."

It’s also a member of the joint venture in International Aero Engines and it’s a major player in the aftermarket Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) sector, providing a serious competitive alternative to the aftermarket contracts offered by the engine OEMs. Its held an investors day conference Nov. 25. Highlights included:

Milestones have been passed on the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fanengine for the Bombardier CSeries, Airbus A320neo family, the Mitsubishi MRJ and Irkut MC-21; and are on schedule for the Embraer E-Jet E2.



The success of the GTF is requiring huge production commitments.



The large number of airplane/engine programs require a major ramp-up of production during the next few years.



The major investment in new engines is largely over for now, leading to the expectation of long-term revenue from MRO.

That said, MTU is looking toward the future with new engines for the 757/767 replacement, the New Small Airplane (NSA) and the follow-ons to the Boeing 787 (the 787X) and A330 (A330X). The 757/767 replacement timing is targeted for about 2025 in the MTU view, which coincides with what we reported months ago. MTU sees a 757/767 replacement market of 400-600 aircraft, compared with the 200 for the 757 replacement seen by Airbus.

Development of the NSA would follow that of the 757/767 replacement, according to MTU’s update. This sequence tracks what we reported months ago. The 2030 timeline is consistent with recent statements by Boeing CEO Jim McNerney but is a few years later than the 2027 timeline we anticipated.

The falling price of fuel doesn’t mean there will be cancellations or deferrals of present orders. It could mean extended service of the Boeing 757 and the PW 2000 engine and aircraft powered by the GE Aviation CF6 engines, however, in the MTU view.

The Open Rotor engine is no longer on the MTU horizon. This does not mean that some day it won’t reemerge.

The engine aftermarket sector is assessed in Figure 4. Revenue from MRO services will be a major part of MTU’s business model during the next several years.

Lower oil prices might make it economically viable to reactivate some of the older airplanes. The key is whether oil prices will remain low or not.

Peru National Police receive fifth Airbus Helicopters EC145 - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3BlcnVuYXRpb25hbHBvbGljZXJlY2VpdmVmaWZ0aGFpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzZWMxNDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Daniel Urresti, Peru’s Interior Minister, in front of the EC145. Ministerio del Interior Photo

Peru’s Ministry of the Interior has now added the final EC145 helicopter to the modernized fleet of the National Police of Peru (PNP). The formal handover at the Police Aviation Unit facilities in El Callao was attended by both Peruvian and French officials, including Peru’s interior minister Daniel Urresti and Daniel Leimbacher, chief of the Central Air Command of the French Gendarmerie, along with representatives of Airbus Helicopters.

Five EC145s have been delivered in less than one year since the PNP first selected Airbus Helicopters as its partner to renew its helicopter fleet. The first four aircraft have already accumulated more than 800 flying hours in that time, performing a wide range of missions that demonstrate the EC145’s versatility and operational efficiency throughout Peru’s territory. In addition to surveillance operations and support for parapublic missions, the EC145 has proven itself to be a reliable and effective ally in the PNP’s fight against illegal mining in the Madre de Dios region on the border with Bolivia and Brazil. The helicopters have also successfully completed more than 20 sea rescue and MEDEVAC missions in Lima and Callao.

The deal for these new EC145s includes a technology transfer program that has already provided training for more than 14 pilots and 20 technicians of the PNP. In addition, the PNP and the French Gendarmerie — both operators of the EC145 — have been engaged in an operational exchange program to provide in-depth training on the tactical uses of these next-generation aircraft. This exchange is part of the cooperation agreement signed between the French and Peruvian interior ministries in the field of security and defense in October 2013. Just a few weeks ago, the PNP participated in high-mountain rescue exercises in the French Alps as part of this program.

The EC145 is the helicopter of choice in the light twin-engine category and is renowned worldwide for police and public service missions. With more than 500 units delivered to date, this helicopter serves in the police fleets of 26 countries — including France, where the Gendarmerie Nationale operates more than 15 units. The EC145 has also been a major success in the Americas, starting with the United States, where the government purchased 345 units to replace the Army’s UH-1Hs. In Latin America, the EC145 performs police and public service missions in a number of countries including Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil.

Powerful and versatile, the Airbus Helicopters EC145 is perfectly suited to the operating conditions in Peru, ensuring the success of missions in extreme conditions whether at sea level, in the jungle or up on the demanding Andean Plateau. With a payload capacity of more than 1.7 tons and a range of 370 nautical miles, the PNP’s new EC145s can transport up to 10 passengers. They are also equipped with PA systems, a siren and multi-frequency radios for hub-and-spoke communications. One of the helicopters features a state-of-the-art infrared camera. This new high-definition camera, the only one in the country, will transmit live images to the command center or ground units, which will optimize surveillance and civil security missions."
JetBlue answers concerns about legroom in new Airbus A320 planes - AL.com,"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTQvMTEvamV0Ymx1ZV9hbnN3ZXJzX2NvbmNlcm5zX2Fib3V0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Groundbreaking, April 8, 2013

JetBlue Airlines is responding to complaints about changes to its Airbus A320 planes as some customers worry that more seats will equal less legroom.

JetBlue plans to revitalize its A320 planes in several ways including slimmer, lighter and more seats along with additional entertainment options.

After an announcement Thursday of scheduled changes in a plan to drive shareholder returns, Anders Lindstrom, JetBlue Airways PR Manager, told AL.com that the cabin seat pitch is what has changed, and it is different from legroom. Seat pitch is the measurement from seat point to seat point, and does not take into consideration slimmer and more ergonomic seats.

In a webcast posted on the JetBlue website on Wednesday, JetBlue's Marty St. George said the new structure adds 15 seats to the A320s for a total of 165 seats, and reduces core cabin pitch from 34 inches to 33 inches.

Although the seat pitch is decreasing, JetBlue continues to have the largest average seat pitch over competitors.

Customers have already experienced the new seats and cabin pitch change on the A321 aircraft and JetBlue has received positive feedback.

Lindstrom said the news seats seen in the A321s, soon to be seen in the A320s, have ""more living space and 'belly room' than our existing core seats.""

He added that along with these changes, customers who travel on the A320 can expect to see new lighting, sidewalls, lavatories, and power outlets. The aircraft will also have larger screens, going from 7 inches to 10.1 inches, and customers can experience more than TV 100 channels.

All upgrades to the A320 will take place in mid-2016.

JetBlue continues to have the largest average cabin pitch among competitors.

Another change coming to JetBlue is beginning in the first half of 2015 customers can choose between three branded fare bundle options. The ""Fare Families"" will be:

""Better"": Free TV, Free Snacks, Award Winning Service, Most Legroom in Coach, 6 TB Points per dollar.

""Even Better"": 1 Bag, Free TV, Free Snacks, Award Winning Service, Most Legroom in Coach, Other Benefits, (6+x) TB Points per dollar.

""Best"": 2 Bags, Free TV, Free Snacks, Award Winning Service, Most Legroom in Coach, other benefits, increased flexibility,(6+y) TB Points per dollar.

Prices for each have not been released.

In 2012 Airbus announced an assembly plant to be constructed in Mobile, a plan that was about seven years in the making. The A320 plane type will be produced in Mobile in the summer of 2015."

The patent drawings show a circular cabin with seats arranged in a “doughnut” pattern, and a delta wing plan. The design aims to overcome some of the problems associated with pressurizing the traditional “flying tube” fuselage. “Cylindrical shapes are good at containing the stresses of pressurized cabins but huge pressures on the cylinder’s front and rear ends need to be managed with strong, heavy structures,” according to the Financial Times. The patent application says this design aims “to provide a simple, economic and efficient solution to these problems, or at least partially overcome the . . . disadvantages.”

Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told NPR the company was interested enough in the idea to patent it, but it’s “not something that’s currently under active development.” The company’s engineers come up with about 600 ideas every year that are filed for patent protection. “There are some very clever people here that have fantastic ideas,” Dubon said. “And who knows? … Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use.”"

(NASA)

BERLIN, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- The European Space Agency and Airbus have been contracted to build a service module for NASA's Orion mission. The service module will be affixed to the crew module and will help propel Orion through space, as well as carry food, water and provisions for onboard astronauts. Officials from NASA, ESA, the German space agency and Airbus gathered in Berlin this week to put their signatures on a contract valued at roughly $490 million. NASA will not actually fork over any cash for the completion of Orion's back end, but will accept the service caboose as payment for future ISS service costs incurred by Europe. Advertisement

The module will borrow much of its design and technology from the unmanned cargo truck, known as the Automated Transfer Vehicle, that Europe has been using to taxi equipment to the space station and back. Airbus insists they and the Europeans wouldn't have been recruited to complete the Orion work without the ATV in their portfolio.

""The service module is a key element of the Orion vehicle. In fact, we talk about the crew module and the service module making up the Orion vehicle,"" Kirk Shireman, the deputy director of Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, told BBC News.

The module will be built in Berlin and is expected to be ready for Orion's 2017 test flight. Orion is scheduled to take a brief unmanned test flight on December 4. The long-term plan is for NASA's spacecraft to deliver astronauts to an asteroid, Mars and deep space targets beyond.

The ESA hopes their early partnership will allow further cooperation down the road.

""It is of course my wish to have a European astronaut -- a man or a woman -- onboard the Orion capsule sometime in the next decade,"" Thomas Reiter, ESA's human spaceflight director, told the BBC. ""I don't think it is too far-fetched to believe that with this path we have now opened, we will get flight opportunities."""

Delta picks Airbus over Boeing in $14-billion wide-body deal - The Globe and Mail,"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL3JlcG9ydC1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzL2RlbHRhLXBpY2tzLWFpcmJ1cy1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy1pbi0xNC1iaWxsaW9uLXdpZGUtYm9keS1kZWFsL2FydGljbGUyMTY4MTM2Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A350-900 aircraft performs a flight pass during the Singapore Airshow in Singapore February 11, 2014.Tim Chong/Reuters Share

Delta Air Lines Inc. has ordered 50 wide-body jets from Airbus Group NV, opting for the European plane maker for a $14-billion (U.S.) purchase following a competition with Boeing Co.

The sale is split between 25 of Airbus's A350-900 planes, an all-new model, and 25 of the updated A330neo, Atlanta-based Delta said Thursday in a statement. The jets will replace Delta's Boeing 747 jumbo jets and 767-300ERs starting in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

Airbus's win builds on earlier successes at Delta, including a 40-plane order in 2013 with a list value of $5.6-billion. Delta had favoured models from Chicago-based Boeing over Airbus until acquiring Northwest Airlines in 2008. Boeing supported Delta's bankruptcy restructuring plan in 2007 in the face of a hostile takeover bid by US Airways.

Subbing out jumbos for mid-sized Airbus jets ""makes sense given Delta's route structure,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based consultant Teal Group. ""I don't think it's an endorsement of Airbus's wide-body competitiveness versus Boeing. On the other hand, this is a nice win.""

Michel Merluzeau, an aviation consultant based in Kirkland, Washington, said before the announcement that the A350 may have beaten Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliner because Airbus had more delivery slots due to an Emirates Airline order cancellation, and the U.S. plane maker picked up that theme Thursday.

'Highly Competitive'

""This was a long and highly competitive campaign,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""Boeing competed for the order with the 787-9, but we did not have enough 787 positions available in the time frame that met Delta's requirement.""

The decision had been described Wednesday by people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified because the details were still private.

The A330neo is a redesigned, refreshed version of Airbus's long-serving A330, a twin-aisle plane frequently used on transatlantic routes – a region where Delta is the biggest U.S. operator by traffic. The A350-900 is due to make its commercial debut with Qatar Airways Ltd. in coming weeks.

Airbus lists the larger of the two A330neo variants for $275-million, while the A350-900's catalogue price is $295-million. Airlines typically get a discount.

A330neo Endorsement

""I view this as great news for the A330neo,"" said Merluzeau, the consultant. ""It gets a big name attached to it"" with Delta's backing, he said by e-mail.

Delta sent out requests for proposals for the aircraft in March as part of its effort to retire older wide-bodies that include the four-engine Boeing 747. The last of the 16 jumbo jets will be grounded by 2017, according to Delta, which also plans to stop flying some of its twin-engine Boeing 767-300s.

Chief executive officer Richard Anderson has pursued a blend of newer, fuel-efficient jets, such as the A330neo, and older, less-expensive models that can save on capital costs at the world's third-largest airline. In 2012, Delta agreed to take 88 used Boeing 717s from Southwest Airlines Co.

Delta has been a supporter of the A330neo, with president Ed Bastian publicly urging Airbus to develop the jet almost a month before the planemaker unveiled the model at the Farnborough Air Show in the U.K.

""It certainly fits in with Delta's view of the market,"" Teal Group's Aboulafia said in a telephone interview. ""They tend to emphasize capital costs over range, and I'm sure they got a very good deal for the A330neos.""

The A330neo will be outfitted with a redesigned wing and new Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines to burn 12 per cent less fuel than the current A330, according to Airbus.

By sweeping the competition over Boeing, Airbus also handed a victory to Rolls-Royce, the London-based engine maker that is the sole supplier of power plants for both the A330neo and the A350. General Electric Co. makes engines for the Dreamliner."

Nothing newsworthy about that is there?

Well the one that has entered assembly at Toulouse is slightly different to the others.

Airbus have developed an updated version of their A330 series with a maximum take off weight, with it raising the bar to 242 metric tonnes (238.17 long tonnes, 266.76 short tonnes).



The first 242 Tonne A330 in assembly – Image, Airbus.

Two aircraft are being built, with the first to be the test and certification aircraft, whilst the second aircraft will be built for Delta Air Lines – who will be the launch carrier of the increased maximum take off weight. Higher weight variants will allow more cargo or passengers, whilst increasing range.

This variant will be an Airbus A330-300, powered with a pair of General Electric CF6 engines. Combined with aerodynamic changes, this will save 2% fuel compared to existing A330-300s.

Whilst 2% saving on fuel burn doesn’t sound a lot, a lot of 2%’s add up to the bottom line of an airlines fuel bill.

Delta have ten of these 242 tonne Airbus A330-300 aircraft on order.

Subject to certification, the newest variant of the Airbus A330 will enter service in the second quarter of 2015.

For those who fly Delta Air Lines, these should represent a further step forward in passenger comfort and amenities… provided they’re fitted out well…

A320 v 737: the sales winner is.... - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMS8xNy9hMzIwLXYtNzM3LXRoZS1zYWxlcy13aW5uZXItaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s one of the bitterest rivalries in the industrialized world: Airbus vs Boeing.

Despite being world-class companies, executives at each often snipe at each other’s airplanes, claiming superiority in economics and passenger appeal. Like lawyers arguing a court case, data is typically selectively used to advance the claims.

One of the most hotly debated issues between the two companies is which is the best single-aisle airplane, the ones that fly the most routes in the world and which carry more passengers than any other type: the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 families.

Boeing’s marketing and communications team has done a superb job of claiming its 737 is the best selling jetliner of all time and with 12,257 firm orders since the first program, the 737-100/200, was launched in 1964. The 737 edges out the A320 family’s 11,021 orders. (These figures exclude options and MOUs.)

But the A320 was launched in 1984, 20 years after the 737. A even-up comparison should begin in March 1984 comparing the A320 family with the 737 Classic from then to the end of the Classic’s production run; and with the 737 Next Generation from its program launch in November 1993; followed by the A320neo and the 737 MAX.

When the count is adjusted to start from the A320’s program launch, Airbus can correctly claim it has sold more A320 Family members than Boeing has sold 737 Classics, NGs and MAXes over the same period.

The 737, which entered service in 1968, had a solid customer base built up in the 16 years before Airbus launched the A320 program in March 1984. The so-called 737 Classic (300/400/500) is no longer in production, having been superseded by the 737 Next Generation (NG), launched in November 1993. The NG and the ceo are still in production. Coming from nowhere, with no customer base, Airbus captured 47.5% of the firm orders and 48.9% of the firm orders plus options, letters of intent and memorandums of understanding.

Airbus launched its re-engined A320neo (New Engine Option) in December 2010. Boeing launched the 737 MAX. the following July. These each come in three sub-types. Airbus is the runaway-market winner.

Boeing points out that Airbus had a seven month head-start on program launch and claims that since the MAX was launched, it’s won 50% of the campaigns. The website PDXlight.com provides an independent look at sales in the days since launch; the A320neo consistently outsells the 737 MAX.

The first of the A320neos is scheduled to enter service in October next year. The first 737 MAX is scheduled to enter service in July 2017.

Boeing’s dominance in the single-aisle is a thing of the past, and it won’t return for at least another decade and perhaps a decade and a half—certainly not until Boeing designs an entirely new, “clean sheet” airplane and this even depends on the Airbus response.

Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, asked about the market share on the third quarters earnings call Oct. 22, maintained Boeing’s long-running statements that it will recover to obtain a 50% share of the A320-737 market.

Airbus’ isn’t concerned about the prospect of a Boeing NSA, or New Single Aisle airplane. Kiran Rao, Airbus’ executive vice president of sales and marketing, and John Leahy, chief operating officer-customers, said on several occasions that there won’t be enough technological advances in engines and airframes to support a new, clean sheet airplane before a 2030 entry into service, or EIS. It’s possible that by 2025 an NSA could be designed and into service with 25%-30% lower operating costs than today’s A320s and 737s. But if the benchmark is changed to the new A320neo and 737 MAX, each predicted to be 14% better than today’s airplanes, there is a huge challenge to achieve 25% or better by 2030, let alone 2025. It can’t be done by the earlier date, Rao and Leahy say.

“We’re comfortable with the A320neo,” Rao says.

Boeing claims its 737-800 and successor the 737-8 are about 8% more economical per seat. Airbus makes counter-claims, but airlines that evaluated the planes and some that operate both the A320ceo and 737NG say Boeing has an operating cost advantage of only 2%. But customers, whose opinions count far more than the hype promulgated by Airbus and Boeing, say the A321neo is a superior airplane to the 737-9 and sales figures support this.

On Oct. 21, Airbus upped the ante. Airbus confirmed to the on-line newsletter Leeham News and Comment that it now is offering an A321neo high gross weight that will replace the Boeing 757-200 on 3,900nm routes that are too “thin” for long-range twin-aisle airplanes like the Airbus A330 or Boeing 787 that carry twice the passengers of the 757. Boeing’s 737-9, with a basic design dating to the 1960s, can’t be further developed to match the new A321neoLR (Long Range).

The A321neoLR will further marginalize the 737-9.

At the low end of the Airbus and Boeing offerings, the smallest A319ceo and 737-700 on their last legs. There have been few recent sales and the backlog for each is winding down as deliveries are made. Their replacements, the A319neo and the 737-7, are largely regarded in the industry as placeholders, rear guard action to serve as a road-block, if one is needed, against the new, clean-sheet 135-seat Bombardier CS300 and Embraer 122-seat E-195 E2. The strategy is more illusionary than real. There are more than 180 firm orders for the CS300 (EIS late 2015 or early 2016) and 50 for the slightly smaller E-195 E2; the latter is still in its infancy, with an EIS of 2019. There are just 49 orders for the A319neo (EIS 2017) and 55 for the 737-7 (EIS 2019). There are two identified customers for the A319neo, Frontier Airlines and Columbia’s Avianca, and 12 orders listed as Unidentified customer(s). Frontier is transitioning to an Ultra Low Cost Carrier and will likely opt for the larger A320neo or even the A321neo, the largest member of the family. Avianca needs the hot-rod performance of the high-powered, light-weight A319neo for its South American service and will probably take the order.

The 737-7, on the other hand, is problematic. Southwest Airlines in the USA has 30 on order and Canada’s Westjet the other 25. When the time comes to “cut metal” about 2018, it’s quite possible each will upgauge to the larger 737-8.

This leave Boeing in quite the quandary: a 737 MAX family with a good-selling -8, a non-existent -7 and a poor selling -9.

At the October European conference of the International Society of Transport Aircraft Traders, a poll was taken of the 1,200 delegates asking if Boeing or Airbus had the more competitive single-aisle airplane. Fifty percent of the audience voted for Airbus; just 23% for Boeing. It’s quite the comedown for the proud Boeing.

Airbus has neatly mouse-trapped Boeing.

Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hopes to see it seldom used.

Germany's Health Minister Hermann Gröhe and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier officially presented the first specially-adapted Ebola evacuation Airbus at Berlin Tegel airport on Thursday.

The aircraft is ""an important contribution"" to the fight against Ebola, Gröhe said. Named after the celebrated German physician and pioneering microbiologist Robert Koch, the plane, according to Lufthansa, is a world first.

Intensive care

Aircrafts previously used to transport Ebola-infected patients were much smaller and unable to always provide the necessary care. Steinmeier stressed, however, that the specially-adapted Airbus A340-300 ""Robert Koch"" guaranteed medical care under ""optimal conditions.""

The machine is nearly 64 meters (210 feet) long, and its passenger seats and the rest of the cabin interior were removed and replaced by a ""patient transportation isolation unit.""

Inside the specially-built airtight tent, an Ebola patient can be cared for to the same extent as in intensive care at hospital, without pathogens escaping and endangering the rest of the crew. The aircraft can also accommodate up to 19 attendants, including technicians for special equipment, officials and doctors.

Lufthansa said that more than 700 pilots and flight attendants have volunteered to work as crew aboard the Ebola Airbus.

""It's probably the one Lufthansa aircraft that we hope to rarely see used,"" said Steinmeier.

'Ecouraging' clinical trials

Also on Thursday, Ebola vaccine researchers said that they were ""encouraged"" by the results of an initial clinical trial, in which volunteers developed antibodies needed to fight the virus. The end product, however, is still some time away.

In the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola, the virus has killed some 5,500 people this year, predominantly in West Africa.

To industrially accompany the A350 XWB ramp-up and other aircraft production rate increases, Airbus took the decision to launch the development and production of five new Belugas.

The new Beluga will be based on the A330 with a large re-use of existing components and equipment. The distinctive looking lowered cockpit, the cargo bay structure and the rear-end and tail will be amongst the items which will be newly developed.

The first of the five new Belugas will enter in service in mid-2019. The existing Beluga fleet will operate in parallel, and will be progressively retired through to 2025.

The current Beluga fleet of five aircraft is based on the A300. The “Beluga”, is Airbus’ unique method for transporting large aircraft components– between company production sites in Europe.

Airbus had already l launched “the Fly 10000” project aiming at doubling the current Beluga capacity by 2017. However the current capacity is limited and the new Beluga fleet will close this capacity gap.

With its flexibility and short transport lead-times, oversize air transport is a cornerstone of Airbus’ industrial operations."

ANALYSIS: What do recent production rate changes mean? - Flightglobal,"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtd2hhdC1kby1yZWNlbnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRlLWNoYW5nZXMtbWVhbi8xMTUyMDEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Richard Evans, senior consultant, who recently joined Ascend from Rolls-Royce, examines recent announcements about production rate changes at Airbus and Boeing

We have seen two production rate changes announced recently, so it seems a good time to summarise the current production outlook from Airbus and Boeing. Individual programmes will have specific drivers of change, but it is also worth reviewing how the airframers’ plans stack up against overall market numbers.

Production rates are often described as Rate 5 or Rate 10, for example, which simply refers to the number of aircraft manufactured per month. For Boeing products, the annual production is 12 times this figure. At Airbus, because of the summer holiday period, the quoted rates are maintained for 11 or 11.5 months a year. For example, Rate 10 on the A330 programme equates to an annual production of 110 aircraft.

The first announcement was made by Boeing on 2 October, when it said that it “will increase production on the 737 programme to 52 airplanes per month in 2018 in response to strong market demand from customers worldwide”. Once this increase is implemented, more than 620 airplanes per year are expected to be built under the 737 programme, “the highest rate ever”.

Boeing is currently building 42 737NGs per month, and had already said this would be increased to 47/month in 2017. The primary reason behind the latest announcement appears to be the need to create additional slots for the 737 Max. The slots are valuable because the 737 Max is running about two years behind the competing A320neo, making availability an issue in key strategic campaigns.

This means that based on production rates, Boeing will maintain a delivery advantage over Airbus in the single-aisle sector for the rest of the decade. In 2018, the implication is that Boeing will have a delivery market share of about 54%, building 620 737s versus 500 A320s. This is despite the fact that Airbus has a firm backlog of 4,721 A320s to Boeing’s backlog of 4,011 737s, giving Airbus a 54% share. Taking only firm orders, Airbus has a 59% share of the re-engined variants.

IMPLICATIONS FOR SINGLE-AISLE DELIVERIES

The increased delivery slot availability from Boeing gives it more flexibility to go out and win new customers for the 737 Max, but slots alone will not determine the eventual market share. It remains to be seen if Airbus will respond with an increased rate on the A320neo. Ascend assumes that Boeing would have switched over production entirely to 737 Max by early 2019, so the new rate is also a challenge for CFM, which will have to ramp up Leap-1B production from zero in 2016 to about 1,400 engines three years later.

A320 and 737 production rates, when combined, will mean about 1,200 deliveries in 2018/19, up from 933 last year. The chart below shows how this compares to the Flightglobal Fleet Forecas for single-aisle aircraft.

It can be seen that the combined Airbus and Boeing production closely matched the overall single-aisle forecast before the latest Boeing announcement, but it now exceeds our forecast by 5-10% – or more should Airbus also raise rates. Airbus’s own forecast for single-aisle deliveries is 22,000 over the next 20 years, which averages at 1,100 per annum. Boeing has a slightly higher forecast of about 1,250 a year.

This is arguably within the margin of error of any top-down forecast, but the implication is that there is no room for the delivery plans of the new entrants, the Bombardier CSeries, Comac C919 and Irkut MC-21. Programme delays may give greater opportunity to Airbus and Boeing here. However, it is entirely possible that aircraft retirements could be the balancing figure to enable these deliveries to happen. With a current fleet of 13,000 aircraft, growing to around 18,000 by the end of the decade, it is not difficult to imagine that a few hundred extra retirements will occur, balancing supply and demand in the process. This would have a limited impact on average retirement age and, hence, residual values.

The Flightglobal Fleet Forecast also takes the view that Airbus will win a market share of >50% against the 737, based on the current firm backlog, and we will only change this if customer orders move in favour of Boeing in the next few years.

A330 AND 777 CHALLENGE

The increased delivery slot availability from Boeing gives it more flexibility to go out and win new customers for the 737 Max, but slots alone will not determine the eventual market share. It remains to be seen if Airbus will respond with an increased rate on the A320neo. Ascend assumes that Boeing would have switched over production entirely to 737 Max by early 2019, so the new rate is also a challenge for CFM, which will have to ramp up Leap-1B production from zero in 2016 to about 1,400 engines three years later.

A320 and 737 production rates, when combined, will mean about 1,200 deliveries in 2018/19, up from 933 last year. The chart below shows how this compares to Ascend’s Flightglobal Fleet Forecast for single-aisle aircraft.

The second announcement was of Airbus reducing A330 manufacturing from Rate 10 to Rate 9 from Q4 2015. This should not have come as a major surprise given the decline in book-to-bill ratios in the last few years. Indeed, the backlog for the A330 has been declining ever since 2008, and now stands at 230, compared with 425 at the beginning of 2009.

The launch of the A330neo has been a huge positive for the overall A330 programme, and we expect the letters of intent (LoIs) signed to be converted to firm orders shortly. However, the new variant, with first delivery in December 2017, has created quite a production gap to fill.

In addition to successfully converting LoIs, Airbus would need to secure up to 150 further orders for the A330ceo in order to fill the gap before entry of the A330neo, assuming Rate 9 is continued. Our fleet forecast implies that further production rate cuts are likely, down to an eventual production of about six per month from 2019 onwards. Any delay to entry into service (EIS) or ramp-up of the A330neo will increase the challenge.

The 777 has arguably an even greater challenge to “bridge the gap” to the 777-X. EIS is not until 2020, over two years later than the A330. The current GE90-powered versions still have an impressive backlog of 275 aircraft, but that has declined from 356 at the end of 2012.

In order to maintain the current level of production, Boeing would need to win around 330 new orders (including 90 option/LoI conversions). There is no plan as yet for a 777-X freighter version (although a version of the -8 is expected in the 2020s), so the 777-200 Freighter is part of the solution to bridging that gap, but the cargo market remains in the doldrums. Hence the vast majority of additional orders must come from 777-300ERs. The Ascend forecast indicates that a production rate cut is highly likely, perhaps down to Rate 6 between 2017 and the EIS of the 777-X.

The first Emirates Airbus A380 completes a 3C-Check - Aviation24.be,"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvZmlyc3QtYTM4MC1kZWxpdmVyZWQtZW1pcmF0ZXMtY29tcGxldGVzLTNjLWNoZWNrLWxhcmdlc3QtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2UtY2hlY2stYWlyY3JhZnQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXZpYXRpb24yNC5iZS9haXJsaW5lcy9maXJzdC1hMzgwLWRlbGl2ZXJlZC1lbWlyYXRlcy1jb21wbGV0ZXMtM2MtY2hlY2stbGFyZ2VzdC1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1jaGVjay1haXJjcmFmdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Watch the entire process captured on camera

DUBAI, U.A.E., 13th November 2014: Emirates Engineering marked another milestone when the team performed its first 3C-Check on an A380, a major overhaul that restores the airline’s first A380 aircraft to near pristine condition.

In a round-the-clock operation taking 55 days, two teams of highly specialised engineers stripped the entire interior of the double-decked aircraft to the bare metal hull, inspected and overhauled every single part, and then put the plane components back together again.

“The entire check is meticulously planned with no room for delays. Grounding an aircraft for such a long time is a tremendous expense which means that our engineering teams must not only work extremely efficiently, but also deliver to a superior standard,” said Colin Disspain, Vice President of Base Engineering at Emirates.

“Here in Dubai, we operate aircraft under some of the world’s toughest conditions, including soaring temperatures and a sandy environment. This requires Emirates to increase maintenance standards to our specific situation. For example, parts often need to be exchanged instead of just cleaned in order to achieve our high level of quality and precision.”

The check was completed with a rigorous test flight before being put back into regular service, in this case, carrying passengers to Brisbane and Auckland.

“The aircraft has been fully overhauled during its 3C-Check. We return it in a pristine condition, just as it originally left the factory,” Colin Disspain. “It’s like having a brand- new A380 again.”

Emirates was the first airline to place an order for the iconic A380, and is today the world’s largest operator of this efficient and spacious twin-deck aircraft. The airline’s first A380 (registration EDA – Echo Delta Alpha) was delivered in June 2008, and deployed on the airline’s inaugural A380 flight from Dubai to New York.

Flight hours, landings and aircraft age determine the due date for a 3C-Check. In this case Echo Delta Alpha had flown an impressive 20 million km, the equivalent of almost 27 return trips to the moon. It has completed over 3,000 take-offs and landings, carrying over 1.2 million passengers safely across the globe.

Months of meticulous planning led up to the C-Check on Echo Delta Alpha. Even though the experienced team of engineers have performed hundreds of C-Checks on the various aircraft of the Emirates fleet, this check was out of the ordinary simply because of the tremendous size of the A380. Operated until a few hours before the check, Echo Delta Alpha was towed into one of the Emirates Engineering hangars at Dubai Airport. Purpose-built for the A380, each hangar is as large as two football fields.

In the first 12 days of the check, over 1,600 parts were removed from the cabin interior including 475 Economy and Business Class seats, 14 First Class private suites, 16 galleys, 2 bars, 2 showers, floor panels and even parts of the cockpit. Every part was inspected and – where required – replaced.

A major part of the operation was the removal of two of the aircraft’s pylons which connect the engine with the aircraft’s wing. Each pylon holds a massive engine which weighs an impressive 6.7 tonnes.

The last two weeks were dedicated to putting all parts back in place with all teams on a tight schedule.

Echo Delta Alpha is one of Emirates’ fleet of 232 aircraft, including 55 A380s. Operating the biggest A380 route network of any commercial airline worldwide, Emirates currently serves 31 airports on 5 continents. To date, the airline’s fleet of A380 aircraft has carried 27.5 million revenue passengers, made over 68,800 trips and covered more than 405 million kilometres.

Its Dubai-Los Angeles route is the world’s longest commercial A380 flight in operation, and its Dubai-Kuwait route is the world’s shortest.

The order for 25 state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft and 25 advanced Airbus A330-900neo aircraft fits within Delta’s existing capacity and capital expenditure plan and continues the airline’s focus on making prudent, cost-effective investments in its fleet.

“Delta always approaches fleet decisions with a balance of economic efficiency, customer experience enhancements, network integration and total cost of ownership,” said Nat Pieper, Delta Air Lines’ Vice President – Fleet Strategy and Transactions. “The A350 and A330neo support our long-haul, transoceanic strategy and join a mix of Boeing and Airbus aircraft that provide exceptional flexibility for Delta’s global network as well as strong cash-on-cash returns for our shareholders.”

Airbus A350-900

The long-range Airbus A350-900 will continue Delta’s optimization of its Pacific network, operating primarily on long-range routes between the U.S. and Asia. The jets are expected to generate a 20 percent improvement in operating cost per seat compared to the Boeing 747-400 aircraft they will replace. Delta will take delivery of the A350 beginning in the second quarter of 2017.

The A350-900 will be powered by two fuel-efficient Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines.

Airbus A330neo (A330-900)

The widebody A330-900neo, an enhancement of Airbus’ successful A330 family featuring greater aerodynamic and economic efficiency, will be deployed on medium-haul trans-Atlantic markets as well as select routes connecting the U.S. West Coast and Asia. The aircraft are scheduled to enter the Delta fleet in 2019 and will deliver a 20 percent operating cost savings per seat over the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft it will replace.

The A330neo features the Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engine which is built with similar technology to the Trent XWB on the Airbus A350.

Delta Air Lines began a structured fleet renewal in 2011 with the selection of new Boeing 737-900ER aircraft along with Boeing 717s and two-class Bombardier CRJ-900 regional jets, and continued it with transactions for Airbus A321 and A330 aircraft. Those aircraft are replacing inefficient older technology airplanes, generating substantial cost improvement and increased customer satisfaction. The airline continues to invest in the onboard product and amenities available to customers on its entire domestic and international fleet including installation of transoceanic satellite in-flight Wi-Fi, Delta Studio featuring a library of free streaming programming as well as more than 1,000 on-demand movies, television shows and music on large, high-definition seatback monitors, and other service improvements.

Incident: Lufthansa A321 near Bilbao on Nov 5th 2014, loss of 4000 feet of altitude

By Simon Hradecky, created Tuesday, Nov 18th 2014 17:11Z, last updated Sunday, Dec 28th 2014 22:22Z





The French BEA reported in their weekly bulletin that the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Germany's BFU.



The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Munich for 75 hours before resuming service on Nov 8th.



The Aviation Herald learned that the loss of altitude had been caused by two angle of attack sensors having frozen in their positions during climb at an angle, that caused the fly by wire protection to assume, the aircraft entered a stall while it climbed through FL310. The Alpha Protection activated forcing the aircraft to pitch down, which could not be corrected even by full back stick input. The crew eventually disconnected the related Air Data Units and was able to recover the aircraft.



Following the occurrence EASA released



An occurrence was reported where an Airbus A321 aeroplane encountered a blockage of two Angle Of Attack (AOA) probes during climb, leading to activation of the Alpha Protection (Alpha Prot) while the Mach number increased. The flight crew managed to regain full control and the flight landed uneventfully.



When Alpha Prot is activated due to blocked AOA probes, the flight control laws order a continuous nose down pitch rate that, in a worst case scenario, cannot be stopped with backward sidestick inputs, even in the full backward position. If the Mach number increases during a nose down order, the AOA value of the Alpha Prot will continue to decrease. As a result, the flight control laws will continue to order a nose down pitch rate, even if the speed is above minimum selectable speed, known as VLS.



This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of control of the aeroplane.



The EASA requires as immediate emergency action that the flight crew operating manuals must be amended with a procedure to keep only one Air Data Reference Unit operative and turning the other two off in following cases:



- the aircraft goes into a continuous nose down pitch movement that can not be stopped by full backward stick deflection

- the Alpha Max (red) strip completely hides the Alpha Prot strip (black/amber) without increase in load factor

- the Alpha Prot strip rapidly changes by more than 30 knots during flight maneouvers with increase in load factor while autopilot is on and speedbrakes are retracted

A Lufthansa Airbus A321-200, registration D-AIDP performing flight LH-1829 from Bilbao,SP (Spain) to Munich (Germany) with 109 people on board, was climbing through FL310 out of Bilbao about 15 minutes into the flight at 07:03Z, when the aircraft on autopilot unexpectedly lowered the nose and entered a descent reaching 4000 fpm rate of descent. The flight crew was able to stop the descent at FL270 and continued the flight at FL270, later climbing to FL280, and landed safely in Munich about 110 minutes after the occurrence.The French BEA reported in their weekly bulletin that the occurrence was rated a serious incident and is being investigated by Germany's BFU.The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Munich for 75 hours before resuming service on Nov 8th.The Aviation Herald learned that the loss of altitude had been caused by two angle of attack sensors having frozen in their positions during climb at an angle, that caused the fly by wire protection to assume, the aircraft entered a stall while it climbed through FL310.

The BFU reported Spain's CIAIAC delegated the investigation to the BFU on Nov 11th 2014.



The BFU reported that according to flight data and cockpit voice recorder the first officer (35, ATPL, 6,473 hours total, 5,179 hours on type) was pilot flying, the captain (52, ATPL, 16,384 hours total, 12,414 hours on type) pilot monitoring. After the aircraft climbed clear of top of clouds at about FL200 the flight data recorder recorded a fixed value of +4.2 degrees for the left hand AoA sensor, less than a minute later the FDR began to record a fixed value of +4.6 degrees for the right hand AoA sensor. The aircraft subsequently turned to fly direct to LATEK waypoint, during this turn the captain noticed the Alpha Protection Band had unusually and significantly increased. The first officer therefore reduced the climb rate from 800 to 500 feet per minute to enable the aircraft to accelerate. A short time later the first officer disengaged the autopilot and gave a brief nose down input.



The aircraft however continued to pitch down, inputs to counter the pitch down remained without effect. About 45 seconds after the nose down began the first officer alerted the captain who took control of the aircraft, that at this time had reached a rate of descent of 4000 feet per minute and a pitch of -3.5 degrees. The captain provided a maximum nose up input which caused the aircraft to pitch up again and the rate of descent decreased and the aircraft entered level flight.



The captain was able to maintain altitude by providing a continuous nose up input deflecting the side stick about 50% of its travel. The autopilot could not be engaged again, and a manual nose up trim was not possible.



The crew checked for related checklists but did not find any. The crew reset the Flight Augmentation Computers 1 and 2 in sequence with no effect.



8 minutes after the aircraft began its descent the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) issued an automated information to dispatch showing the three AoA sensor values amongst other data.



21 minutes after the aircraft began its descent the crew sent a message to maintenance checking whether a simultaneous reset of all FACs would be possible. Maintenance replied in the positive stating that the aircraft would revert to alternate law as result. Another 7 minutes later the crew reported they needed to constantly pull on the sidestick, trim was inoperative and autopilot could not be engaged and the Alpha Prot Band came up extremely quick. In addition the crew received a message ""PH6 AOA3"" on the centralized fault display system (CFDS). Upon suggestion by maintenance the crew switched off the air data reference unit (ADR3), however, without effect. ADR3 was reengaged. Another 12 minutes later maintenance wrote a message to the cockpit along the lines ""after review of the data we found the values for AoA 1 and AoA2 appear to be frozen and report too high an angle of attack. If the problem persists, disengage ADR1 and ADR2 which will cause the aircraft to revert to Alternate Law however."" then followed up ""perhaps it is sufficient to just disengage ADR2"".



The crew disengaged ADR2 which immediately prompted the aircraft to revert to Alternate Law and it was no longer necessary to pull the nose up.



The crew decided to use the remaining hour of flight time to verify the system status and to prepare for landing and landed safely at the destination.



The BFU reported that the aircraft features three Angle of Attack sensors consisting of a heated movable vane, the movement of the vanes is converted into electrical signals and the actual angle of attack computed by the related air data reference unit.



If the measured/computer Angle of Attack exceeds the value of Alpha Prot by one degrees, the autopilot is automatically being disengaged. In manual flight if the Alpha Prot Angles is exceeded, the Alpha Protection activates, the position of trim is stored and used as maximum nose up trim, the function of the side stick changes to command a specific pitch angle with the most nose up angle being Alpha Max which can be reached by full nose up deflection of the side stick.



The BFU reported that all three AoA sensors were examined by the manufacturer, no damage, malfunction or anomaly was identified with either of the sensors.



Airbus analysed the data and stated: ""all three sensors worked normally until about 8 minutes into the flight, when the aircraft climbed through FL195. At that point, at an ambient temperature of -35 degrees C, AoA sensors 1 and 2 froze up at a position of approximately 4.5 degrees nose up and remained in this position until the aircraft descended towards the destination airport. At the time, when the autopilot disengaged the aircraft was flying at 0.675 mach, the Alpha Prot angle was 4.2 degrees, the Alpha Max 5.8 degrees. Within 15 seconds the first officer made increasing nose up input until reaching 75% of the maximum travel of the side stick, the attitude however changed from 4.5 degrees to -3.5 degrees against this input. The system disregarded/turned off the AoA 3 sensor because it disagreed more than the permitted value with the other 2 sensors.



When later ADR2 was disengaged, the system immediately reverted to Alternate Law because ADR3 had already been disengaged by the system and now two ADRs were offline.



The BFU reported that they are working to establish how reliable AoA sensors are but annotated: ""The algorithms and boundary conditions differ from each other and are not entirely known to the BFU. The investigation is aiming to establish the probability of a repeat of this occurrence.""

On Mar 24th 2015 Germany's Büro für Flugunfall Untersuchungen (BFU) reported in their November 2014 bulletin, that the first officer observed an irregularity in the properties of the speed indication just prior to reaching FL310 and disengaged the autopilot, the aircraft in response began a descent that lasted for about one minute before the crew was able to stop the descent at FL270.The BFU reported Spain's CIAIAC delegated the investigation to the BFU on Nov 11th 2014.The BFU reported that according to flight data and cockpit voice recorder the first officer (35, ATPL, 6,473 hours total, 5,179 hours on type) was pilot flying, the captain (52, ATPL, 16,384 hours total, 12,414 hours on type) pilot monitoring.

Tom Cruise Spent His Weekend Hanging Out of an Airplane for Our Moviegoing Enjoyment - Vanity Fair,"Mon, 03 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL2hvbGx5d29vZC8yMDE0LzExL3RvbS1jcnVpc2UtbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXBsYW5lLXN0dW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tom Cruise is so committed to pleasing the moviegoing public that he spent this past weekend hanging out of an Airbus plane—while in flight at an estimated 5,000 feet above the English countryside—for an upcoming Mission Impossible movie. Could Cruise have let a stuntman do the death-defying stunt? Yes. Could he have relied on C.G.I. magic rather than risk his life for a film sequence that will likely last a few minutes on-screen? Yes. But would that have been authentic? No.

The Daily Mail has photos of the 52-year-old, in character as Mission Impossible secret agent Ethan Hunt, clinging to the exterior of an Airbus A400M. The actor seems to be secured by only a few safety harnesses attached to the plane door. A class act, Cruise performed the entire stunt while wearing a tailored suit and dress shoes.

This is not the first incredible action stunt Cruise has performed for the franchise, which he also produces. For 2011’s Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, the actor scaled down the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, ensuring that the experience was dizzyingly authentic in IMAX. Take a look at the finished sequence here.

The fifth Mission Impossible film, which is scheduled for a Christmas 2015 release, will co-star Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, Simon Pegg, and Alec Baldwin. The plot to the film, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is not yet known."

The new Airbus Beluga will be based on the A330 with a large re-use of existing components and equipment. The distinctive looking lowered cockpit, the cargo bay structure and the rear-end and tail will be amongst the items which will be newly developed.

The first of the five new Belugas will enter in service in mid-2019. The existing Beluga fleet will operate in parallel, and will be progressively retired through to 2025.

The current Beluga fleet of five aircraft is based on the A300. The “Beluga”, is Airbus’ unique method for transporting large aircraft components– between company production sites in Europe. Airbus had already l launched “the Fly 10000” project aiming at doubling the current Beluga capacity by 2017. However the current capacity is limited and the new Beluga fleet will close this capacity gap.

With its flexibility and short transport lead-times, oversize air transport is a cornerstone of Airbus’ industrial operations.

PRESS RELEASE"
New Airbus design includes circular theatre-style rows - Daily Mail,"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL3RyYXZlbF9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjg1MTUwNy9OZXctQWlyYnVzLWRlc2lnbi1pbmNsdWRlcy1jaXJjdWxhci10aGVhdHJlLXN0eWxlLXJvd3MtbWVhbi1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWZseS1CQUNLV0FSRFMuaHRtbNIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL3RyYXZlbF9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjg1MTUwNy9hbXAvTmV3LUFpcmJ1cy1kZXNpZ24taW5jbHVkZXMtY2lyY3VsYXItdGhlYXRyZS1zdHlsZS1yb3dzLW1lYW4tcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1mbHktQkFDS1dBUkRTLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A round theatre-like design for seating is the latest idea being floated by one plane manufacturer - and it could revolutionise how passengers travel by air.

Airbus has filed a patent to go with a concept for a circle of seats on board its aircraft, a complete change in direction to the usual row formation used today.

According to the application, the circular seating 'allows structure to be more resistant to loads induced by the cabin pressurization'.

Airbus' plan for seating will see rows replaced by a circular plan where customers will face each other

The seating plans by Airbus are the latest in a long line of changes being explored for air travel (File Photo)

It means that because aircraft come under great pressure front and back when airborne, frames and support are needed to balance the load, thus limiting the amount of space available for passengers.

Airbus believes that a circular design for seating will help to distribute the pressure more evenly and in turn increasing space for more seats.

For airlines, more passengers means more profit - but the new design raises the question of comfort for passengers facing each other, especially for hours during long-haul flights.

And, as every seat will be facing a different angle, the sensation of flying backwards, or even sidewards, may not appeal to many.

Could seats that face backwards really be the future of flying - and more importantly, would anyone be willing to travel this way?

Award-winning designer James Lee's concept improves passenger seating with new-look designs Includes dual armrest, foot rest, tablet stand and cup holder

The plan is the latest in a long-line of prospective redesigns on board aircraft.

A host of intriguing blueprints were recently revealed at the influential Aircraft Interiors Expo, held in Hamburg in northern Germany earlier this year.

An armrest that is suitable for two will be seen as a huge bonus to passengers

These include the ground-breaking concept of a row of seats where two of the chairs look in one direction, while the third, in the middle of the trio, gazes to the rear.

Drawn up by Paris-based Zodiac Aerospace, this design would supposedly allow passengers more room to move, without disturbing their neighbours.

Just as interesting when it comes to flights without clashing limbs and knocked arms is the two-tier armrest created by Hong Kong-based company Paperclip Design.

A clever creation, yet one so simple that you might be amazed it has not been thought of before, the armrest allows two passengers to perch their funny-bones on the partition between seats at the same time – without invading each other’s personal spaces.

The same firm has also concocted the imaginative ‘Caterpillar Convertible’ seat – which has already won awards thanks to its versatility.

Futuristic and flexible, the Caterpillar can be both a cheaper seating option in the economy cabin – or can be reconfigured as something rather more exclusive in business class, with the capacity to spread out as a flat bed.

And James Lee, who has won accolades for his forward-thinking concepts, revealed his plans for new long-haul seats with Hong Kong-based company Paperclip Design.

As well as seats with a reclining backrest and a tray with a tablet stand, holidaymakers would also be able to relax on flights with a footrest under the chair in front of them.

Potentially spelling the end to elbow wars among travellers sitting next to each other, Lee's Meerkat seat concept also includes a dual-use armrest."

Panthers to assume ASW role in Indonesia - Defense Update,"Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQxMTA1X2FzNTY1bWJlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has been selected to provide 11 AS-565 MBe Panther helicopters for the Indonesian Navy, Airbus announced today. These rotorcraft will to be used for naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions, supporting operations from land bases and ships. The helicopters are scheduled for delivery within three years to Indonesia, where they will be outfitted for their ASW mission, before delivery to the Indonesian Navy. The mission equipment include the Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS) dipping sonar and torpedo launching system.

Panther now becomes one of the world’s most capable light/medium anti-submarine warfare platforms, with an advanced ASW suite and the capability to operate from corvettes or small frigates

HELRAS DS-100 produced by L-3 comprises a descending vertical transmit array of seven projector elements and a receive array of eight hydraulically driven arms that expand to a diameter of 2.6 meters when deployed. The total weight of the system is about 350 kg. The AS-565 is configured to carry the Raytheon Mk 46 or Whitehead A.244/S lightweight ASW torpedoes.

The DS-100 is A 1.38 kHz version of the popular AQS-18A dipping sonar. The DS-100 is capable of operating at depths to 500 meters designed for long-range surveillance and underwater search. Using high resolution doppler processing and long shaped pulses, it can detect submarines even very low speed (near zero doppler signal). According to L-3, the DS-100 is also suited to redetection, target localization and weapon delivery against submarines at deep and shallow waters. The HELRAS is used with several types of helicopters, including the Italian Navy EH-101 and SH-3. A version of the system is also tailored for the ASW variant of the European NH-90.

“The Panther now becomes one of the world’s most capable light/medium anti-submarine warfare platforms, with an advanced ASW suite and the capability to operate from corvettes or small frigates,” said Philippe Monteux, Head of Region South East Asia & Pacific at Airbus Helicopters.

He added that the Panther’s ASW capability would meet the naval requirements of other countries in the region.

Although the Panther has been available for many years, the new contract represents its first penetration to the Asian market. The reason for its slow entry to market is probably the competition form the Chinese built variant – Harbin Z-9 which was based on the SA-565 civilian variant – Dauphin. Beyond the Chinese Army and Navy the Z-9 is operating with Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan.

This order will add to the Indonesian Armed Forces’ fleet of Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft serving the Indonesian military, which currently operates the light EC120 Colibris for training; the Fennecs and BO-105 for light attack missions and the Pumas and Super Pumas operated by the Air Force. The Indonesian Air Force is expecting to receive the EC725 for combat search and rescue missions.

PT Dirgantara, Airbus’ strategic industrial partner in Indonesia is also involved in other programs, including the C-295 military transport. The agreements were secured by PT Dirgantara Indonesia as a result of its long-standing cooperation and strategic alliance with Airbus Helicopters. The President of PT Dirgantara Indonesia, Budi Santoso explained, “This latest contract demonstrates the strength and efficiency of our commercial and industrial partnership with Airbus Helicopters. Together, we are able to identify and deliver the most modern and cost-effective solutions for the Indonesian Government and at the same time associate the significant involvement of the Indonesian industry.”"

The Toulouse-based manufacturer says it will build five “new Belugas”, the first of which is scheduled to enter service in mid-2019.

Like its predecessor, the new aircraft will feature a lowered cockpit section to facilitate transport of large airframe segments on the main deck in an extended cargo bay structure.

Airbus

But Airbus says it will be able to use a “large” extent of existing component and equipment for the A330 series.

Meanwhile, the existing Beluga fleet is to be gradually retired until 2025.

The General Electric CF6-powered aircraft were manufactured between 1994 and 2001, Flightglobal’s Ascend Fleets database shows.

Airbus

Airbus is aiming to double the capacity of that fleet by 2017 through initiatives, such as the construction of dedicated hangars that permit loading of the aircraft in all weather conditions.

But the manufacturer says it needs additional capacity for the production ramp-up of the A350 and other programmes.

The route to Chicago will not have an aggressive start, with only three services a week between the two cities from June 2015.

The timetable looks like this:

A three-time-a-week service is akin to dipping your toes in the water to see what the temperature is like – is it going to be too cold or too hot (so that a service isn’t viable), or is it just right, or is there room for the service to expand in the future.

None the less, it’s an interesting addition to the network, where they serve New York, Miami (from December) and Toronto (seasonally).

Finnair is also a member of the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement between American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and US Airways, allowing cross selling and coordination of routes and fares.

More options are always welcome across the Atlantic, and if this opens up new flows of traffic from Europe and Asia – the better.

One way its planning of doing it is to increase frequency on two of its routes from Düsseldorf to the USA, with two services being boosted for the Summer 2015 season.

It’s an interesting move by Air Berlin to boost its network. Whilst it feeds to its part owner Etihad, the airlines network – both short and longhaul do need to stand up on its own two legs and show it can deliver loads and yields to the airline.

Adding flights on popular routes like this is a good way to do it – providing there are passengers who pay the higher fares… and don’t want to fly Lufthansa.

Flights are loaded in the booking system

These flights could be a good value Avios redemption due to the low taxes. That’s providing you can get seats…

The final assembly of Airbus’ first A330 with the new 242 tonne maximum take-off-weight (MTOW) capability is underway at the A330 Final Assembly Line in Toulouse, France. The aircraft is currently completing its structural assembly before the cabin integration phase and will be used for certification flight trials. A second aircraft is being assembled in parallel which is destined for entry in service in Q2 2015 with launch customer for the new weight variant, Delta Air Lines.

Patrick Piedrafita, Airbus’ head of the A330 program said: “I am very proud to see the first 242 tonne A330 at the final assembly stage only two years after launch. This newest, enhanced variant of our popular A330 Family is the basis for the future A330neo and is a concrete example of Airbus’ incremental innovation strategy in action.” He added: “Airlines operating the new 242 tonne A330 will be able to carry additional payload on longer routes, while at the same time enjoying a very high operational reliability of 99.4 per cent.”

Thanks to an aerodynamic package reducing aircraft drag and the latest engine improvements, the 242 tonne MTOW offers an extended range of up to 500 nautical miles and up to two per cent reduced fuel consumption. The 242 tonne A330-300 is capable of flying missions up to 13 hours and 15 hours for the 242 tonne A330-200. So far, nine customers worldwide have already selected this option since the launch in November 2012.

The A330 Family includes Freighter, VIP, and Military Transport/Tanker variants, has now attracted more than 1,300 orders. Over 1,100 A330 Family aircraft are flying with more than 100 operators worldwide. The A330 is one of the world’s most efficient aircraft with best in class operating economics. With numerous on-going product enhancements entering service in the coming years, the A330 Family remains the most cost-efficient and capable widebody aircraft, averaging operational reliability above 99 percent. These enhancements include the more capable 242 tonne take-off-weight variant (available for both the A330-200 and the A330-300), the A330 optimised for regional and domestic routes and the A330neo, The A330 belongs to the successful Airbus Widebody aircraft Family, which comprises the A330, A350 XWB and A380, and uniquely spans the 250 to over 500 seats segment."

Airbus has filed a patent application for an unusual concept plane that has been dubbed a ‘flying doughnut’.

Instead of queuing on a jet bridge, passengers would board the UFO-like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘access hatch’, and they would enjoy more space on flights.

'Flying doughnut': This drawing shows Airbus' concept for a new aircraft with a circular cabin

Passengers would board the UFO-like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘access hatch’

The futuristic plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle, giving it the shape of a doughnut.

Passengers in economy would be seated in the outer ring, while business seating would be located within the inner ring.

The unconventional aircraft, shaped like a Stealth Bomber, would be lighter and have more cabin space for travellers while solving a long-standing problem related to cabin pressure.

According to a 15-page patent application filed late last month, the concept plane would be free from the stress that cabin pressure places on cylindrical aircraft, meaning it would be more economic and efficient.

The plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle, giving it the shape of a doughnut

Conventional planes have sealed bottoms with heavy fasteners to withstand the loads induced by cabin pressurisation.

In its patent filing, the France-based manufacturer wrote: ‘The present invention proposes an aircraft wherein the structure delimiting passenger cabin extends over 360 degrees around a space defined outside structure.

‘The invention allows structure to be more resistant to loads induced by the cabin pressurization, while allowing to reduce or even to avoid the need for a sealed bottom.’

Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told NPR that the design may never be in production as the company files over 600 patent applications every year.

He said: ‘Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use.’

Airbus has come out with a number of futuristic concepts, including a virtual reality isolation helmet

The France-based manufacturer has patented a design for benches with bicycle-like saddle seats

Airbus, which manufactures the A380, the world’s largest passenger plane, has patented a number of futuristic concepts that may never materialise.

One of them is a virtual reality isolation helmet, which looks like a prop from a Star Wars film.

With comfort in mind it would cancel out peripheral noise – including crying children or chatty adults – and allow passengers to immerse themselves in in-flight entertainment.

Each headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses for better viewing, earphones and a mini-airbag to protect the head during extreme turbulence."
"MR Interview: Erik Ceuppens, SVP, Satellite Communications, Airbus Defense & Space CIS - MarineLink","Mon, 10 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3MzgwNTE30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transformation in the maritime communication sector continues, as Airbus Defense and Space announces plans to sell its commercial satellite communications business.

MR spoke with Erik Ceuppens, SVP, Satellite Communications, Airbus Defense & Space Communications, Intelligence & Security (CIS), to help put the development in perspective.



The maritime communications sector has been in near continual flux for nearly two decades, with merger and acquisition activity a constant. In tandem with development of innovative software solutions, the connection between ship and shore – particularly the advent of maritime broadband – provides the vital link to help make shipboard operations more efficient and provide enhanced amenities for crew.

Immediately following the SMM 2014 in Hamburg, the latest sector news broke when Airbus Defense and Space – as a part of its Group Strategy Review in 2013 – announced in mid-September that it would divest itself of its commercial and para-public communication business (including Professional Mobile Radio and commercial satellite communications services activities). To put it concisely for those in the commercial maritime sector, this essentially is the Vizada business (except for the government portion) that was bought by Airbus in 2011 including the strong Marlink brand. To help put things in perspective there is no one better than Erik Ceuppens, an industry veteran who has served as the Executive Director Business Communications for Astrium Services (2012/2014); the CEO Vizada EMEA & Asia (2007-2012); the CEO of France Telecom Mobile Satellite Communications (2004-2007) and previously Vice President Marketing & Customer Operations (2001-2004).

“We really are focused as a management team to continue the continuity to our customers, with the same high quality network of advanced VSAT,” said Ceuppens, who said that although there have been changes in overall ownership over the past years, there has been a consistent management team and mission. “We will continue to accelerate our innovations; we will not slow down.”

Ceuppens stressed the continuity of management and mission, particularly since when the announcement was made Airbus did not identify new ownership for the company, and in fact at press time there were no negotiations underway.

“Airbus, as a public company, decided to communicate (the decision to divest) as soon as a decision was taken,” said Ceuppens. “We are in the early stages, as the sales process will have to be started. The process will hopefully find a conclusion by mid-2015, but today there is no clarity on who the new owner will be, there are no talks going on today,” though he did admit that there was strong interest from prospective industrial and financial owners.

While Ceuppens could not comment on the total value of the business to be sold, of the business communications activities to be sold, maritime accounts for about 66%, while land-based “enterprise activities” make up the remaining portion.

And according to Ceuppens the maritime sector is strong and growing, saying that it expects to sell 800 VSAT units this year alone, and that the maritime VSAT business for the company has quadrupled in the last 18 months. “The commercial maritime market is dynamic, and you must have agility, speed and entrepreneurship to keep ahead of the market,” he said. “Today we are living the migration from narrow band to broadband. The demand for VSAT services is very strong, as broadband communications have become more affordable. This is being driven first by crew demands, but increasingly by the business unit of the ship, as owners increasingly view ships and boats as remote offices with the need for connection.

predecessor, and will have essentially the same engines as the Boeing 787.

With the newly launched A330neo widebody twinjet, Airbus may have found a sweet spot in the medium-long-haul, medium-capacity segment. Introduced as a complement to the A350 XWB family, the Rolls-Royce-powered A330-800neo and A330-900neo are targeted to compete with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. They will not have all the high-technology features of their Boeing competitor but may have an edge, notably in acquisition price, on those markets where ultra-long-range capability is not needed. Meanwhile, Airbus has dropped the slow-selling A350-800 XWB.

Thanks to a number of improvements, the A330neo reduces fuel consumption by a claimed 14 per cent per seat. The main factor is the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 turbofan that replaces the Trent 700 (see box on p. 49). In fact, “The Trent 7000 is highly common with the Trent 1000-TEN, our latest engine for the Boeing 787,” a Rolls-Royce spokesman told Skies.

The differences between the two engines are the integration of bleed air offtake for aircraft services (such as air conditioning) and a new accessory drive gearbox that accepts A330 accessories. Minor changes enable integration with the A330neo airframe, nacelle and pylon.

“The A330neo will have essentially the same engines as the 787 and engine technology accounts for the overwhelming share of fuel burn reduction,” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told Skies.

The Trent 7000 will provide between 68,000 and 72,000 pounds of thrust. A major difference with the A330 classic, from the customer’s standpoint, is the absence of any other engine option than Rolls-Royce. The UK-based manufacturer is also the sole source on the A350 XWB.

Other modifications help fuel burn reduction. The A330neo will be at least 800 kilograms (1,750 pounds) lighter than its predecessor. This comes on top of aerodynamic enhancements such as new A350 XWB-inspired winglets, an increased wingspan and new engine pylons.

“The cost of fuel represents half of the total cost of operating an aircraft,” noted Kiran Rao, Airbus’ executive vice president, strategy and marketing. The composite winglets, optimized wing twist and wing span extension from 60.3 to 64 metres (198 to 208 feet) will together confer increased lift and reduced drag, he further explained. In other words, both increase the aspect ratio, and hence aerodynamic efficiency.

The cabin will undergo incremental change, too. It will be further optimized to offer up to 10 additional 18-inch-wide seats. Passengers will enjoy fourth-generation in-flight-entertainment—3D films, touchscreens and an Android environment. Airbus promises full connectivity.

Cabin lighting will be brought to the 787 and A350 XWB level, thanks to LEDs. They are expected to be lighter and cheaper to maintain than traditional illumination, while offering unlimited mood-lighting customization scenarios. For example, during a night flight, the wake-up scenario can intensify light progressively, as opposed to switching from off to on. Airlines may like the branding possibilities.

The overhead bins will be made larger. Passengers may notice them upon boarding and be really pleased about it. “A new shape will accommodate larger bags; on the A330, a roller bag does not fit in wheels-first: you have to turn it side-on, which means only one bag per row,” noted John Walton, an aviation journalist and columnist specializing in passenger experience.

In the cabin, flight attendants will be offered an improved working environment, according to Airbus. The cabin intercommunication data system will be upgraded, featuring a new control panel for mood lighting, water levels, temperatures and voice announcements. In addition, the galley insert developed for the A350 XWB will be available for the A330 and will include an espresso coffee maker, chillers and ovens with baking functions.

The A330neo will use the same cockpit as the A330. Pilots and cabin crew alike may also appreciate the new, segregated lower-deck crew-rest area, Airbus said. This also frees up more space on the main deck for extra passenger capacity. Thanks to features like the lower-deck crew rest and the more space-efficient galley, the A330-900neo will accommodate up to 10 additional seats, from 300 to 310. The A330-800neo will seat up to six additional passengers, from 246 to 252.

Combined with the more fuel-efficient engines and aerodynamic refinements, the increased seat count results in the promised 14 per cent lower fuel burn per seat. John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer, made it clear the larger engines over-compensate their additional weight and drag with improved fuel efficiency. The 14 per cent number is for the A330-900neo at maximum takeoff weight on a 4,000 nautical mile (nm) mission. The -800 and -900 have a maximum range of 7,450 nm and 6,200 nm, respectively (see chart on p. 48). Some 400 nm of these can be credited to the new turbofan.

Despite the aforementioned changes, the A330neo will retain 95 per cent airframe spares commonality with the A330. It will also offer five per cent lower airframe maintenance costs, thanks to fewer tasks in the program and longer intervals. For new parts such as the engine pylons and some sections of the improved wing, Airbus is planning on fewer man-hours over the typical 12-year maintenance cycle. Also helping to achieve the five per cent reduction in maintenance costs is the new electric bleed air system, which replaces pneumatic controls for bleed air. The technology is already proven on the A380 and is also flying on the A350 XWB. On the 787, Boeing has gone one step farther, getting rid of bleed air. This avoids the negative impact, on efficiency, of drawing air from the compressor.

The A330neo also retains the A330’s economy seat width and this is a major source of debate between the two manufacturers. Most A330 operators use an eight-abreast configuration. This translates into 18 inches per seat. A few low-cost airlines have installed nine seats per row but, at 16.5 inches, this is quite a bad experience for the passenger, Walton noted, so that configuration is not very common.

Ironically, one of the A330neo’s first customers, AirAsia X, is famous for its A330s’ nine-abreast layout. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the majority of A330s flying today have an eight-abreast layout.

This is not the case with the 787. As its fuselage is a bit wider, many operators have devised a nine-abreast configuration, translating into a 16.9-inch seat width. “Most 787 operators have installed a 3-3-3 seat configuration, which makes the seat narrower than an A330 seat,” Walton emphasized. A Boeing executive would not discuss seat width. “Seats and the way seating is laid out are decisions made strictly by the airline,” Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s marketing vice president, answered Skies when asked about the sensitive issue.

But maybe it should be seen in perspective. “There is an irony in the debate about seat width in economy class—this is not the class you are supposed to focus on if you want to generate revenues,” Aboulafia pointed out. Comfort is not only about seating. The 787’s composite structure enables it to simulate a lower cabin altitude and provide more humidity. Also, the airflow is greater, Walton said. This makes a difference in how tired the passenger feels at the end of a flight. On the 787, the larger windows admit more natural light, especially at dusk and dawn. But Aboulafia is a skeptic about the merits of better passenger comfort. “There is no way to prove it brings anything to the airline,” he said.

To compete against the Boeing 787-9 (shown here in Air New Zealand livery),

In just a few days in July, Airbus announced 121 orders and commitments for the A330neo. “Our aim is to allow Asians to fly point-to-point and this new aircraft becomes a critical piece of our strategy,” AirAsia X director and co-founder Tony Fernandes said. John Higgins, president and chief commercial officer of global aircraft leasing firm Avolon, supported Airbus’ views on the range target. “We see an evolution as the average range flown by twin-aisle aircraft in the A330neo category eventually comes down,” he said.

Steven Udvar-Házy, chairman and CEO of Air Lease Corp., agreed. “The world’s fastest-growing marketplace continues to be Asia-Pacific; with its largest growth in sub-eight-hour flight durations. The A330neo is optimized for this, so when we look at where the largest area for growth is for expansion in the next 10 to 20 years, the A330neo’s range hits the sweet spot,” he said. Udvar-Házy, however, told the Seattle Times that for long-range routes the 787-9 is obviously superior to the A330neo and will be preferred by ultra-long-haul carriers. He said the two jets will also compete head-to-head in medium-long-haul markets such as transatlantic, from Europe to the Middle East and intra-Asia.

Boeing’s Tinseth is adamant the A330neo, deemed “out-of-date technology,” can’t compete with the Dreamliner. “It’s impossible to make the A330 as efficient as the 787—even with new engines,” he told Skies. He emphasized the Airbus strategy of having the A350 XWB as a single family to cover the widebody market “has failed.”

Aboulafia is more bullish. In addition to praising the new engines, he anticipated a lower unit price. “The A330neo will have a lower capital cost than the 787—a fair estimate is about 15 per cent less,” he said.

“With the 787, you are paying for the additional range,” he explained. With the A330neo, “you won’t have the same range, the same prestige and the same technology features you have on a 787; but the A330 is a popular plane and you can get it quickly at a good price,” he went on.

Time to market may be an important factor, too, in the business case. “If you order a 787 now, the delivery will happen toward the end of the decade,” an executive at a major Airbus supplier told Skies. Therefore, he said keeping the A330neo program on time is critical for its manufacturer, as the first delivery is planned by the end of 2017. Airlines may also appreciate the total cockpit commonality with in-service A330s, which will save a lot of pilot training time.

When combined, these factors may ensure Airbus a production rate of 50 to 60 A330neo aircraft per year for another 10 years. Airbus is more optimistic, forecasting 1,000 to 1,100 sales between now and the end of the next decade.

Deliveries of the A330neo are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2017. As for the engine, the first test run is planned for 2015, with certification expected in 2017. “We have learned a lot of lessons in building the A320neo, which is why we are able to do the A330neo in a shorter period of time,” said Rao. The entire development program is planned to last 42 months."

The Tahiti Infos news site says the carrier is looking to acquire either four upgraded A330s or A350-900s. Given order backlogs with manufacturers Airbus (AIB, Toulouse Blagnac) and Boeing (BOE, Washington National), Air Tahiti Nui will likely only take delivery of its first new aircraft in 2019/2020 at the earliest.

""It is not we who define the schedule, it is the manufacturers,"" CEO Michel Monvoisin said. ""At this point in time, we have to consider that the best possible delivery date [for new jets] will be in either 2019 or 2020.""

The renewal plan has taken on a strong degree of urgency given that the expiration in 2017 of a French law exempting tax on investments in France's overseas territories (Loi de Développement économique des outremers - Lodeom) could result in each aircraft costing EUR67million (USD83.9million) more. To help improve planning in its territories, Paris has promised to issue a final decision concerning the law's future next year."

Airbus To Deliver First A350 Jetliner To Qatar Airways By Mid-December - Gulf Business,"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1maXJzdC1hMzUwLWpldGxpbmVyLXRvLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYnktbWlkLWRlY2VtYmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European planemaker Airbus aims to deliver the first A350 jetliner to launch customer Qatar Airways by mid-December, the airline said on Tuesday.

Gulf News quoted its chief executive Akbar Al Baker as saying the mid-sized jet would be delivered between Dec. 12 and 15 and appeared to rule out any last-minute hitches that might rattle investors in planemaker parent Airbus Group.

“Everything is perfect,” he said, according to the Dubai-based newspaper.

In the United States, a representative for the Gulf carrier said the aircraft would be delivered around Dec. 12.

The A350, Airbus’s newest plane and made with a carbon-fiber composite fuselage, is a direct competitor to Boeing’s composite 787 Dreamliner.

The long-range, twin-aisle plane received its certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week, after winning European safety approval in September.

The version of the jet certified by the FAA and European regulators, the A350-900, is designed to seat 314 passengers.

Airbus has booked 750 orders for the A350, including 549 for the A350-900 and 169 for the larger A350-1000, which is due to enter service in 2017. The smaller A350-800 has 32 orders but is likely to be phased out to make way for the revamped A330neo.

Airbus is planning a steep production increase, aiming to build three A350s per month by year-end, up from two a month currently. By the end of next year it plans to build five a month and to hit 10 a month by mid-2018.

Airbus originally targeted entry to service in 2012 when it re-launched the current design of the A350 at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2006.

It later slowed development, both to ensure its maturity and iron out problems including a glitch in wings production, but the schedule has been broadly stable for the past two years.

The plane’s successful test flight programme, regulatory certification and impending first delivery have been well received by Airbus investors, helping shares rise more than 7 percent in the past month."
