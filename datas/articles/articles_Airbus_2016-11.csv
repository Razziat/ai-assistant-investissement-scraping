Airbus A400M Demonstrates Refuelling Contacts With Second A400M - Airbus,"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0xMS1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLXJlZnVlbGxpbmctY29udGFjdHMtd2l0aC1zZWNvbmQtYTQwMG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A400M new generation airlifter has further expanded its capabilities as a tanker by successfully demonstrating air-to-air refuelling contacts with another A400M. In two flights conducted from Seville, Spain the development aircraft performed more than 50 contacts in level flight and turns using the centreline hose and drum unit (HDU). The A400M is the only tactical tanker on the market with this third refuelling point, in addition to its underwing pods, enabling refuelling of large receivers such as another A400M or C-130. It has a basic fuel capacity of 63,500 litres, which can be increased with two extra cargo hold tanks carrying 7,200 litres each, and can refuel from the HDU at a rate of 2,000 litres (600 US gallons) per minute. The technique would allow the A400M to carry a 20 tonne payload more than 6,000nm / 11,000km non-stop from Paris, France to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The standard A400M aircraft has full provisions for air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations already installed and only requires the rapid installation of the optional air-to-air refuelling kit to become a tanker.

Airbus is building air taxis to become the Uber of the skies - Business Insider,"Thu, 03 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpci10YXhpLXViZXItb2Ytc2tpZXMtMjAxNi0xMdIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFpci10YXhpLXViZXItb2Ytc2tpZXMtMjAxNi0xMT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tech giants are starting to turn their attention to ""flying cars.""

Uber released a 98-page white paper last week outlining its plans to bring ""flying cars"" to commuters by 2026. Google co-founder Larry Page is also funding a ""flying car"" project through a start-up named Zee.Aero, and its prototype was reportedly seen in action at Hollister Municipal Airport in October.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But Airbus, which offers a legacy of building civil aircrafts and working with the Federal Aviation Administration, is also developing its own ""flying car"" as part of its Project Vahana — and its aviation experience could give it an edge. Project Vahana is being run under Airbus' Silicon Valley arm, named A³.

To get this out of the way early, all of these companies aren't really interested in developing flying cars, hence the quotation marks. That would indicate they were trying to take the same route as Terrafugia, which is building a hybrid car that can drive on the road and also fly.

But A³, along with Uber and what we know of Zee.Aero, isn't focused on the car portion of a flying car. All three are working on VTOL aircrafts, which is short for Vertical Take-Off and Landing. That means the aircrafts don't need a runway to ascend, similar to a helicopter.

Zach Lovering, who oversees Project Vahana, said it plans to have the production version of its VTOL aircraft ready in four years.

The Project Vahana aircraft will be an electric, single-passenger VTOL plane with eight rotors. Lovering told Business Insider it will have a range ""on the order of a city size, the diameter of a city,"" but declined to provide a specific number. It will have a speed ""twice as fast as cars"" and will achieve an altitude of around 1,000 feet, according to Lovering.

The aircraft will be fully self-piloted.

""The way I would think about it is somewhat like a train... which means before it takes off it has a known flight path it’s going on."" Lovering said.

He said the aircraft will be equipped with lidar, radar, and cameras — the same technology used on many self-driving cars — so it can safely deviate from its flight path if an obstacle gets in its way.

Lovering joined Project Vahana in February after spending four years working for Page's Zee.Aero.

""There’s a much bigger focus here on actual productization and getting this thing out there, rather than focusing on developing really cool technology,"" Lovering said of his decision to leave Zee.Aero.

But why pursue a VTOL aircraft?

Lovering said he can see many uses for these types of transport systems, but that Project Vahana is primarily going after the commuter market.

Lovering said he wants to create a ride-hailing experience that's ""something like Uber has."" Here's how he sees it playing out: the vehicles will have home bases on the top of buildings, such as large parking structures. Users will put where they are and where they want to go into a Project Vahana app, which will then direct them to the nearest depot with the aircrafts.

Related stories

""You either take an Uber there or walk there, depending on how far away it is,"" Lovering said.

Once a user gets in the VTOL aircraft, pre-flight checks would commence. Lovering said relevant information about the flight will be displayed on the app, and there may even be a screen inside the aircraft that could ""hook up to your phone, just as a casting device."" None of these details have been finalized, but speak to the ride-hailing interface Lovering hopes to create.

Uber is also looking to use the VTOL aircraft for commuter purposes as part of its project dubbed Uber Elevate. Uber is planning to have its first vehicles ready by 2021, just one year after Project Vahana plans to finish its aircrafts. Uber has said its official roll-out date will occur in 2026.

Lovering added that Project Vahana's aircrafts could also be used to transport cargo from from facilities to distribution centers. They could also be used to deploy emergency medical stations in disaster areas.

'Huge regulatory hurdles'

But Project Vahana's vision for its VTOL aircrafts hinge on the FAA granting regulatory approval, and that's a big hurdle considering the FAA has yet to even approve commercial drone use.

""The regulatory aspects are definitely something difficult to overcome,"" Lovering said. ""Although in our conversations with the FAA, we met with them earlier this year, they were very receptive to us.""

Lovering said the FAA is moving toward a standard certification process that would expedite the process for approving new kinds of vehicles.

He added that there are organizations working with the FAA to help set these standards, like ASTM International, a volunteer organization that helps develop international standards; the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics, a volunteer organization that develops technical guidance for the industry and is sponsored by the FAA; and GAMA, an aviation industry trade association.

The FAA did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

""It seemed like there were some clear paths forward for the regulatory environment as long as you have a pretty well-defined mission,"" Lovering said of his conversation with the FAA earlier this year.

But there are other hurdles beyond tackling the difficult regulatory environment.

Lovering said A³ needs to figure out how to build an ""air infrastructure"" so the aircrafts can fly safely. The group also needs to set up charging stations at landing sites since the aircraft will be electric.

Lovering said it will be important to partner with other companies working on VTOL aircrafts to work out these challenges. He said he could see A³ working with Uber down the road for that very reason.

""There are just huge regulatory hurdles, air traffic management hurdles, structural hurdles,"" he said. ""That certainly will require not just Airbus and one other company, but probably half a dozen to a dozen companies working together to solve this problem."""
"Airbus, Boeing claim victory in today's WTO ruling over Washington State tax breaks - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 28 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8xMS8yOC9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWNsYWltLXZpY3RvcnktdG9kYXlzLXd0by1ydWxpbmctd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1zdGF0ZS10YXgtYnJlYWtzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nov. 28, 2016, © Leeham Co.: Airbus claims that in a huge blow to Boeing and Washington State, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled today that the $8.7bn tax subsidy package Gov. Jay Inslee and the state Legislature approved for the 777X program is a “prohibited subsidy.”

This is the most onerous finding of illegal subsidies under WTO rules, and one that is rarely determined.

Boeing said the WTO “today rejected virtually all of the European Union’s challenges to the Washington state tax incentives” and declared a “complete victory.”

Dueling statements

The statements from Airbus and Boeing are so at odds that they don’t appear to be reacting to the same WTO decision.

Airbus

“Today’s report from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Panel (DS487) confirms that the United States has ignored international trade rules by permitting illegal subsidies to Boeing, this time targeted at the 777X aircraft,” Airbus said in a press release touting the “knockout blow” to Boeing. “The [WTO] Panel found Washington State’s multi-billion dollar subsidy regime for Boeing to include “prohibited” subsidies, which in the Panel’s words belong to “a special category… which Members have deemed to create such trade distortions that they are proscribed,” because they are “specifically designed to affect trade.”

Boeing

“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel. “The WTO found in September that Airbus has received $22 billion in illegal subsidies from the EU and that without these subsidies neither Airbus itself nor any of its airplanes would even exist today. By contrast, in rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.”

Washington’s $8.7bn in tax breaks were specifically tied to the 777X, the WTO found, in violation of its rules, according to Airbus.

Reactions

Airbus predictably declared victory. So did Boeing.

Airbus, on the defensive for 12 years in the original WTO cases, went into full-court press to declare this a clear win.

Airbus

“Now it becomes clear why Boeing made such a noisy PR stunt on the occasion of the recent WTO ruling requiring some limited adaptations to the European funding schemes. It was all smoke and thunder to cover up for today’s ruling on prohibited US subsidies,” said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group.

“Another in a long series of WTO defeats for Boeing: the WTO confirms funding illegality and market distortion by the 777X subsidies,” said Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus Commercial. “Congratulations, Boeing, you managed to get another free ride to develop your newest aircraft, the 777X. With the past illegal subsidies for the 787, and now the 777X prohibited subsidies, we estimate a loss in Airbus sales of at least $95 billion. How cynical for you to talk about ‘fair’ trade!”

“Today’s WTO ruling is an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry,” EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said via Airbus. “The panel has found that the additional massive subsidies of USD 5.7 billion provided by Washington State to Boeing are strictly illegal. We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.”

Boeing

“In today’s case, the EU challenged seven different state tax incentives,” Boeing said in a statement. “The WTO rejected entirely the EU’s challenge to six of the seven incentives and rejected most of the challenge to the seventh. The WTO held only and narrowly that a reduction in Washington state’s Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate for future 777X revenues is inconsistent with the WTO agreements. The WTO threw out all of the EU’s other challenges to various incentive programs and left untouched even the B&O tax rate as it applies to revenue from the other Boeing models produced in Washington state–the 737, 747, 767, 777 (current model) and 787.

“In light of today’s decision and the massive liability that the WTO has found against the EU and Airbus, we expect the EU and Airbus to appeal today’s decision,” Boeing said in its press statement. “After any appeal,” Luttig said, “we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.”

“[Airbus is] facing sanctions next year and therefore trying to make everyone believe they’ve won a big case against Boeing,” Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, wrote LNC in an email. “[T]hey lost on most points, and the value of the 777X B&O tax incentive ruled a prohibited subsidy amounts to $50 million a year. They went for a prohibited ruling because the amount of money is not enough to distort the aerospace market and thus cause harm, which otherwise must be proven before sanctions can be imposed. This latest WTO ruling is in its first round. It can and likely will be appealed, and that process will run another year.”

The Boeing statement didn’t indicate if it will appeal the WTO finding. But Luttig’s statement above certainly hints that Boeing will do so to preserve “every aspect of Washington State incentives, including the 777X….”

Tax breaks for 777X wing plant, assembly line

Boeing agreed to build a wing production plant in Everett (WA), behind its giant building where all its wide-bodies are assembled (save those 787s in Charleston). Boeing also agreed to assemble the 777X here.

One condition in the agreement was that Boeing could not assemble the 777X elsewhere, unlike this omission in the 787 tax breaks of 2003. Boeing later selected Charleston as the site of a second assembly line. It was this, and several Boeing actions to move jobs out of Washington, that prompted officials to create a close nexus between the 777X and the tax breaks.

777X breaks go beyond 787 deal

Although officials said when they granted the 777X tax breaks that these were merely an extension of the 2003 787 breaks, the 777X breaks are in fact specific to the 777X, the WTO found. Specifically tying them to the 777X proved fatal under the new WTO ruling.

The tax breaks were judged by WTO to be so closely tied to the 777X that only local content can be used, said a person familiar with the decision who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak for the WTO. “That’s what makes it prohibited. They’ve been given money that’s not available to anyone else.”

The 787 tax breaks were found by the WTO to be illegal under a separate case that involved a wide variety of issues. The WTO determined that Boeing received illegal subsidies from NASA, the US Department of Defense and Washington and Kansas.

The 777X tax breaks granted in November 2013 drew immediate attention from Airbus officials. The EU filed a formal complaint with the WTO, focusing on the prohibited subsidies rules. The narrow scope allowed the case to move ahead quickly, at least by WTO standards. (The broader cases against the US and EU are already 12 years old and still counting.)

LNC warned at the time the 777X were illegal under the original WTO case and the finding the 787 tax breaks were illegal. State officials (and local media) dismissed the warning. State officials said the original finding was under appeal.

Suppliers get tax breaks, but unaffected by ruling

State officials claimed when issuing the tax breaks were available to the broader Washington aerospace industry, not just to Boeing, thus making them legal. The WTO disagreed.

But suppliers who benefited so far don’t have anything to worry about in this ruling. Since only Boeing was named in the complaint and none of the suppliers, the ruling only affects Boeing and not them—unless a separate case were launched naming specific suppliers, an unlikely event.

Boeing reported that it benefitted in 2014-2015 by about $521m from the tax breaks, which are claimed from the state on an annual basis as work is done, not up front. It’s not clear how much of this is specific to the 777X, though in today’s statements, Boeing says it’s only $50m a year and not until the first 777X is delivered in 2020.

“In 2015, Boeing got tax breaks and credits totaling $305 million — which is 55 percent more than the state estimated the entire aerospace industry would cash in for that year,” The Seattle Times wrote. “In 2014, Boeing alone exceeded the tax-break estimates by 19 percent.”

What happens next?

What happens now that the WTO ruled?

Airbus expects an appeal by the USTR. WTO rules call for a decision on the appeal within 90 days, but it’s common to take longer. Boeing thinks Airbus will also appeal on the points the WTO denied.

What’s also a certainty is that Boeing isn’t going to step up and write a check to repay the $521m received in 2014-2015, plus whatever the benefit has been received this year.

“Boeing never writes checks, Boeing only cashes checks,” one observer told LNC.

Indeed, when the EU filed its complaint against the US/Boeing, following the US complaint against the EU/Airbus, Jim McNerney, then CEO of The Boeing Co., and Jim Albaugh, then-CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said that if the WTO found Boeing had received illegal subsidies from federal and state governments, they’d step right up and repay the amounts.

The WTO did and Boeing hasn’t.

Appeals by the US of the original complaint continue to grind their way through the WTO process.

Enders, the Airbus Group CEO, called for negotiations.

“I continue to think that the only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic,” he said. “The duopoly is no longer the framework of reference in the future. Look at the huge subsidies the Canadian government has granted to Bombardier just recently, look at the upcoming competition from Russia and Asia. Hence we need a global framework, like the one ICAO recently elaborated for aviation CO2 emissions. This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ for more than a decade.”

A new deal

Boeing’s agreement with Washington provides that if the WTO finds tax breaks illegal, the State must come up with an alternative to replace these tax breaks. The form is not specified.

The Nov. 8 election in Washington included an initiative, I-732, that would impose a carbon tax to reduce pollution. There was an offset in the State’s Business and Occupation (B&O) tax (a tax on gross receipts) in an attempt to make the carbon tax revenue neutral.

Boeing would have major beneficiary of the elimination of the B&O tax.

“[I]f I-732 were to pass, Boeing could no longer be accused of taking special tax breaks. That tax would simply be gone for all manufacturers. Boeing’s B&O bills would be cut to zero,” The Seattle Times wrote.

That would have solved the WTO issue.

Whether this was an attempt to create something to benefit Boeing in lieu of the tax breaks is a matter of speculation. But it’s a moot point. The initiative lost.

Harm to Airbus

Boeing previously outlined the amounts of harm it believes it suffered from $22bn in subsidies it calculates Airbus received.

As with the allegations of harm to Boeing from illegal subsidies by the EU to Airbus in the previous action, the EU claimed harm to Airbus from the 777X tax breaks.

At the time Boeing began offering the aircraft, there wasn’t a 777X or an Airbus equivalent, but this isn’t a key element in determining prohibited subsidies.

The WTO considers whether Boeing could have launched the 777X and what Airbus have offered without the Boeing subsidies.

The WTO looks at the market place at the time. As a consequence of these subsidies, Boeing offered the 777X to airlines rather than the 777-300ER. Airbus would have competed with the A350-1000, a competitor to the -300ER. Airbus doesn’t have a competitor to the 777-9.

The WTO considered potential lost sales for the A350-1000.

“One of the benefits of proving a prohibited subsidies case is that whether or not there are lost sales, it is so illegal that it must be gotten rid of,” says the person familiar with WTO rules.

Status on previous cases

The previous WTO cases have been referenced above.

The US complaint against the EU and Airbus was adjudicated and Airbus was found to benefit from illegal subsidies. However, the US complaint that it received prohibited subsidies was rejected.

The EU and US appealed for different reasons. The WTO appeal decision came down in September, largely affirming the original findings. Both sides again appealed in October. The EU appealed principally on interest rate assumptions used by the WTO on the A350 and A380. The US appealed the rejection of prohibited subsidies complaints.

The WTO ruled that Boeing received illegal subsidies from the US government and from Washington State (the 787 tax breaks). Both sides appealed. The decision on these appeals is due to be handed down next month.

Flight test campaign benefitting from the A350-900 experience and maturity;

Three test aircraft to perform all flight testing in under one year;

Development on track for entry into service scheduled for the second half of 2017.

The first of three A350-1000 development aircraft to fly – MSN059 – has landed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport France at 15.00hrs local time after successfully completing its first flight which lasted four hours and 18 minutes.

The crew in the cockpit on board this flight comprised: Hugues van der Stichel, Experimental Test Pilot; Frank Chapman, Experimental Test Pilot and Gérard Maisonneuve, Test-Flight Engineer. Furthermore, monitoring all the test parameters at the Flight-Test-Instrumentation (FTI) station behind the cockpit were: Patrick du Ché, Head of Flight & Integration Tests; Emanuele Costanzo, Head of A350 Development Flight Tests; and Stéphane Vaux, Flight-Test Engineer.

Powered by Rolls-Royce’s new Trent XWB-97 engines, the aircraft traversed south-western France, during which the crew explored the aircraft’s handling and flight envelope. The aircraft was accompanied by a chase plane to observe and film the various manoeuvres. Its progress was monitored by experts on the ground in real-time via a direct telemetry link.

Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier said: “We have seen today the world’s most modern and efficient passenger aircraft – the A350-1000 – in action for the very first time, adding soon to the successful A350 Family. My congratulations and thanks go to all the teams who have contributed to make today’s flight happen.” He added: “We are equally pleased that many customers have witnessed this important milestone today together with us – here from our headquarters in Toulouse.”

Benefitting from the experience of the original A350-900 test campaign (accomplished in 2014), the A350-1000’s development programme will be shorter – under one year for the three aircraft. MSN059’s duties for performance testing will include exploration of the flight envelope, handling qualities, loads and braking. The second aircraft to fly, MSN071, will also be tasked with performance evaluation, which will encompass braking, powerplant, systems and autopilot. The third and final aircraft to fly – MSN065 – will be equipped with a cabin and will evaluate the cabin and air systems. MSN065 will also perform the “early long flights” and route-proving. The overall campaign will culminate in the type’s certification followed by its entry into airline service in the second half of 2017 with first operator Qatar Airways – the largest A350-1000 customer to date with 37 on order.

The A350-1000 is the latest member of the Airbus leading widebody family, together with the A330neo, offering unprecedented levels of operating efficiency, low noise and true long-range capability. As well as having a longer fuselage to accommodate 40 more passengers than the A350-900, the A350-1000 also features a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. The A350-1000 embodies all of the fuel efficiency and ‘Airspace’ cabin comfort of the original A350-900 – but with extra size perfectly tailored for our customers on some of their busiest long-haul routes. To date 11 customers from five continents have placed orders for a total of 195 A350-1000s.

Airbus

WTO DELIVERS KNOCKOUT BLOW TO BOEING’S RECORD-BREAKING SUBSIDIES WITH HISTORIC RULING

 Extends the WTO’s earlier condemnation of massive illegal subsidies to Boeing to 26 billion USD in the form of wholly non-refundable corporate welfare. This is the single largest state-level instance of corporate welfare in US history.

 The subsidy package condemned by today’s report is large enough to fund the entire development of the 777X and has already cost Airbus $50 billion in sales.

 This is only the second time in the WTO’s 20+ year history that a country has been found to have provided prohibited subsidies contingent on domestic content.

Today’s report from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Panel (DS487) confirms that the United States has ignored international trade rules by permitting illegal subsidies to Boeing, this time targeted at the 777X aircraft. The Panel found Washington State’s multi-billion dollar subsidy regime for Boeing to include “prohibited” subsidies, which in the Panel’s words belong to “a special category… which Members have deemed to create such trade distortions that they are proscribed,” because they are “specifically designed to affect trade.”

“The United States and Boeing picked this fight at the WTO, and today’s ruling is yet another blow for that strategy,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus Group. “Those prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn immediately following today’s historic ruling, meaning that Boeing must give up these massive tax subsidies.”

This ruling adds to the previous findings by the WTO in 2012 that federal, state, and local governments in the United States are providing huge and WTO-inconsistent subsidies to Boeing (DS353), now mounting up to a total of 26 billion USD of pure grants which Boeing has no plans to repay. “The earlier WTO rulings had already confirmed that B787 was the most highly subsidized aircraft in the history of aviation,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. “Today’s report leaves no doubt that Boeing has gone even further. The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State’s taxpayers. We estimate the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry in the region to be $50 billion so far, and that’s only for the 777X. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) should take immediate action. This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the U.S. Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behavior.”

Among those subsidies found to be WTO-inconsistent in 2012 – due to the significant competitive harm caused to Airbus – was the very same Washington State tax incentive regime found today to include a “prohibited” subsidy. “Instead of complying with that 2012 ruling, the United States has doubled-down on illegal conduct,” explained John Harrison, General Counsel, Airbus Group. “By extending the tax incentives through the year 2040, increasing their value by nearly $9 billion, making them available to a new Boeing aircraft, and adding an illegal contingency, the United States and Washington State are further defying WTO compliance.”

Industry specialists suggest that the nearly $9 billion in subsidies provided by Washington State is largely sufficient to cover the entire cost of design and production of the 777X, essentially giving Boeing a “free ride” by offsetting entirely the costs of developing and bringing the aircraft to market.

Considering today’s ruling, together with the 2012 ruling in the original dispute, Boeing has caused at least $95 billion in commercial harm to Airbus, opening the door to trade sanctions against the US in an equivalent amount. As Harrison explains: “The WTO has for the first time in these disputes identified prohibited subsidies to Boeing for the 777X, condemning as the worst form of trade violation a full aircraft development illegally financed by taxpayer money. And that is supposed to be good for American business and workers? Unlike the loans to Airbus – the interest rates of which were considered in the WTO dispute against the European Union – Boeing plans no repayment of any kind.”

Harrison added that: “The United States has no other option than to direct that Washington State repeal the legislation or amend it in a way that makes it WTO-compliant. That would obviously take away any incentive to keep producing the 777X in Washington State and it will certainly not benefit Boeing’s balance sheet.” The Panel has declared that the US must end the prohibited subsidy regime in Washington State within 90 days. This is on top of the ongoing US failure to comply with the original WTO ruling against Boeing subsidies – for which the public panel report is expected in the next several months.

Airbus once again congratulates the European Commission and the Governments of France, Germany, the UK and Spain for their success at the WTO, and is grateful for the years of effort they have invested in setting the record straight.

“We hope this outcome will lead those at Boeing who advocate continuing this trade dispute to reconsider,” Tom Enders concluded.

Statement on WTO ruling

The World Trade Organization (WTO) today rejected virtually all of the European Union’s challenges to the Washington state tax incentives.

In today’s case, the EU challenged seven different state tax incentives. The WTO rejected entirely the EU’s challenge to six of the seven incentives and rejected most of the challenge to the seventh. The WTO held only and narrowly that a reduction in Washington state’s Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate for future 777X revenues is inconsistent with the WTO agreements. The WTO threw out all of the EU’s other challenges to various incentive programs and left untouched even the B&O tax rate as it applies to revenue from the other Boeing models produced in Washington state–the 737, 747, 767, 777 (current model) and 787.

In total, the EU claimed that Boeing had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totaling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible. The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X rate incentive, and will not until 2020, because the first airplane will not be delivered until then.

“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel. “The WTO found in September that Airbus has received $22 billion in illegal subsidies from the EU and that without these subsidies neither Airbus itself nor any of its airplanes would even exist today. By contrast, in rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.”

“The WTO has repeatedly found that Airbus is entirely a creature of government, and they must now bring themselves into compliance with the international laws or risk massive sanctions,” said Luttig.

In light of today’s decision and the massive liability that the WTO has found against the EU and Airbus, we expect the EU and Airbus to appeal today’s decision. “After any appeal,” Luttig said, “we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.”

"Airbus' newest, biggest version of the A350 makes its first flight - USA TODAY","Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE2LzExLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1uZXdlc3QtYmlnZ2VzdC12ZXJzaW9uLWEzNTAtbWFrZXMtaXRzLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC85NDM4MTcwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus' newest, biggest version of the A350 makes its first flight

TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus flew its new A350-1000 wide-body jet for the first time on Thursday, The jet, the largest twin-jet airplane the European aerospace company has ever made, took off from Airbus’ headquarters near the French city of Toulouse. It's the largest and latest variant of the company's flagship A350 line of jetliners.

The aircraft took off from the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport at 10:42 a.m. local time (4:42 a.m. ET), flying for several hours over southern France before returning.

The A350-1000 will seat between 366 and 440 passengers, depending on the configuration airlines choose for it. Its range of 7,950 miles will enable the jet to connect cities like Boston and Shanghai or Los Angeles and Manchester, England, according to Airbus.

It is powered by the Trent XWB engine, manufactured by Rolls-Royce. The engine is capable of out-putting 97,000 lbs of thrust.

Airbus anticipates the jet will deliver to launch customer Qatar Airways late next year, following a full year of flight testing.

The airplane is the latest installment in Airbus’ A350 program, first launched in 2006. Qatar Airways became the first carrier to take delivery of an A350 in late 2014.

The jets are manufactured with lightweight carbon-fiber composite materials instead of the more traditional aluminum, allowing for greater fuel efficiency and more flier-friendly features, such as larger windows more-comfortable cabin humidity levels.

In addition to the newly added -1000 series, the A350 family also includes a smaller -900 version. The -900 seats around 325 passengers in a standard configuration and can fly 200 miles further than the larger -1000. The -900 first took to the skies in 2013, and entered commercial passenger service in early 2015 when Qatar Airways deployed the jet on its route between Doha, Qatar and Frankfurt.

The first flight of the -1000 is also the latest bid in an ongoing battle for sales in the twin-engine long-haul jet market, a segment that Boeing has dominated for decades.

The two airplane-makers have increasingly attempted to one-up one another in recent years, each trying to outdo the other with ever-larger and more-efficient airplanes.

Airbus' A350-1000 is aimed squarely at dethroning one of Boeing's most popular products, the 777-300, which has sold 809 frames to date. Airbus says the A350-1000 is 25% more fuel efficient and 30 tons lighter than the venerable Boeing jet.

“The -1000 has killed the 777-300ER,” said Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier during an interview on Thursday. “What we wanted has been achieved, without having even demonstrated it in flight,” he added, noting the performance capabilities of the -1000.

Boeing has already responded in force to the A350-program, launching the 777X program in 2013. The three-strong family of 777-revamps include two versions (777-9X and 777-10X) that carry more than 400 passengers in a three-class configuration – quite a bit more than the A350-1000.

Bregier believes the 777-9X's increased capacity works against the airplane instead of for it.

“It's not that there is a market pushing for a bigger aircraft,” he said, noting that Boeing's larger airplane has not sold especially well since its launch. “They need to add seats to justify the cost per seat,” to stay competitive with the A350-1000, he said Thursday.

Yet many industry watchers are not convinced. Talk has swirled for months, including in Toulouse, that the -1000 was not large enough capacity-wise to compete with the 777X.

At least on Thursday, Airbus was not having it.

“It's much too early today, and I'm not convinced that there will be a large market,” Bregier said. “We would look at the market and the business case. And I can tell you we're far away from that,” he said.

Airbus has 195 firm orders for the A350-1000 with eleven airlines, and 810 for the A350 program as a whole. Airbus is hoping that further sales of the -1000, along with the -900 and a revamped A330 program dubbed the A330neo, will help the company in its quest to capture 50% of the large jet market.

Bregier said separately that a project for a so-called ""A350-800"" was on hold.

The jet was originally slated to be a smaller, longer-range version of the original -900. But it had not been selling well, which Breigier and other executives claimed was a result of the A350-900 Ultra Long Range (ULR) -- another new A350 variant expected to launch with Singapore Airlines in 2018 -- and the cheaper, similarly sized A330neo program.

“If we want to deliver a good -800 [airplane] we need more time; we will continue to work out an improved solution for the -800,” Bregier said.

New nacelle integration facility to be established near Airbus' A320 final assembly site in the U.S. - safran-group.com,"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWZyYW4tZ3JvdXAuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LW5hY2VsbGUtaW50ZWdyYXRpb24tZmFjaWxpdHktYmUtZXN0YWJsaXNoZWQtbmVhci1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1maW5hbC1hc3NlbWJseS1zaXRlLXVzLTIwMTYtMTEtMzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"November 30, 2016

The international network of Safran Nacelles’ jet engine nacelle integration facilities is expanding with a new location at Mobile, Alabama to serve the Airbus U.S. manufacturing facility for A320 family jetliners.

This site will perform the podding of CFM International LEAP-1A engines, which involves integrating the turbofan powerplants with Safran Nacelles-supplied nacelle systems, followed by delivery of the completed units to Airbus for installation on A320neo (new engine option) aircraft.

Situated in the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley on America’s Gulf Coast, the Safran Nacelles integration facility is approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers) from where Airbus builds the single-aisle A320 product line.

Safran Nacelles has signed a 20-year lease at the Mobile Aeroplex for an existing building, which currently is being refurbished to meet the company’s operational requirements. Engine podding activity will begin late next year, with deliveries of integrated powerplants to Airbus beginning in early 2018.

“This addition to our international footprint underscores Safran Nacelles’ commitment to being present at locations around the world in support of our customers,” said Jean-Paul Alary, the President of Safran Nacelles.

Safran Nacelles has full responsibility for design, manufacture and customer support of the LEAP-1A nacelles, as well as its integration with the engine and delivery of complete propulsion systems to Airbus for installation on the A320’s underwing pylon.

The Mobile, Alabama site is part of Safran Nacelles’ $100 million investment in processes, supply chain management and employee skills to support its A320neo nacelle program, which is meeting Airbus’ timing and quality requirements for the fastest and largest production ramp-up in civil aviation history.

Safran Nacelles’ Mobile, Alabama location will utilize the many innovations developed by the company for LEAP-1A nacelle/engine integration, including a specially-designed SmartTrolley engine cradle and transporter. Using the SmartTrolley, Safran Nacelles has significantly reduced the nacelle/engine integration time and optimized the cycle time.

The new Mobile, Alabama facility is in addition to Safran Nacelles’ other engine/nacelle integration sites, which are situated at Toulouse/Colomiers, France and Hamburg/Finkenwerder, Germany; along with an operation in Komsomolsk, Russia.

Safran Nacelles’ podding operation in Alabama will be the company’s second U.S. facility. It joins Safran Nacelles Services Americas in Indianapolis, Indiana, which performs the maintenance, repair and servicing of company-produced nacelle systems used on airliners, regional jets and business aircraft across the North American continent."

Airbus Helicopters delivers first three AS565 MBe Panther to Indonesia - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0xMS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtdGhyZWUtYXM1NjUtbWJlLXBhbnRoZXItdG_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

First three of 11 AS565 MBe Panther helicopters handed over to PT Dirgantara Indonesia

This follows the contract signature in late 2014 with PT Dirgantara Indonesia for 11 AS565 MBe helicopters. The delivery of the remaining helicopters will run through to 2018.“We are excited to witness the handover of the first three AS565 MBe helicopters to our partner today”, said Janick Blanc, Head of the Panther programme at Airbus Helicopters. “The AS565 MBe has been developed using state-of-the-art processes and this enhanced variant of the Panther will benefit from an increased maximum take-off weight at 4,500kg. This will provide increased mission capabilities, specifically for the anti-submarine warfare missions these rotorcraft are expected to perform”, he added.Under the agreement, Airbus Helicopters will supply the AS565 MBe helicopters to its Indonesia industrial partner PT Dirgantara Indonesia, who will reassemble and outfit these rotorcraft in-country, acting as the design authority. This will notably cover the installation of the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) suite which includes a dipping sonar and torpedo launch systems, allowing the Indonesian Navy to carry out its most demanding missions.This Indonesian MBe Panther programme is the latest of a long-standing relationship between Airbus Helicopters and PT Dirgantara Indonesia, who celebrated their 40 years of strategic partnership earlier this month. The two companies have delivered more than 190 helicopters together, through joint programmes over the last four decades.“We have been working with Airbus Helicopters on numerous projects for many years by now, and this milestone today further illustrates the commitment both companies have towards this programme”, said Budi Santoso, CEO and President of PT Dirgantara Indonesia. “We look forward to receiving these green helicopters in Bandung, as we ready to start the installation of the mission equipment, and the subsequent qualification and certification of our future anti-submarine warfare helicopters”, he added.Recognised as one of the world’s most capable light/medium anti-submarine warfare platforms, the AS565 MBe is equipped with two Safran Arriel 2N engines, which enhance the helicopter’s performance in high and hot conditions, while enabling it to achieve a top speed of 165 kt and a range of 780 kilometres. It also boasts a new main gearbox, the latest-generation tail rotor and a 4-axis autopilot that reduces crew workload and makes the most demanding missions easier to perform.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide.

"French Defense Chief, Airbus Spar Over 'Tactical' A400M Deliveries - Defense News","Thu, 10 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8xMS8xMC9mcmVuY2gtZGVmZW5zZS1jaGllZi1haXJidXMtc3Bhci1vdmVyLXRhY3RpY2FsLWE0MDBtLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS -- French officials are in tough talks with Airbus Defense & Space for a timely delivery of a more capable ""tactical"" version of the A400M military transport plane, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.





""The problem is the company,"" Le Drian told the defense committee of the lower house National Assembly on Nov. 2, the official minutes of which were recently released. ""Today, the A400Ms delivered are not operational – and the problem does not concern just France: that is the case everywhere.





""As this meeting is public, perhaps my remarks will reach Mr. Enders. It can be said that the talks I have with the Airbus executives are … lively.""





Tom Enders is chief executive of Airbus group. The Air Force is flying the A400M in its basic version as a cargo plane into secure airbases.





""I have asked for a plan to catch up, both for the aircraft's capabilities and delivery rate,"" Le Drian told members of parliament. The delivery delays were unacceptable and the lack of capabilities for parachute drops, self defense and landing on short runways caused concern.





The ministry has reached an agreement for 2016, he said. ""I hope it will be upheld,"" he said. ""In any case, we have an extremely close dialog with the company.""





France had ordered four Hercules C-130J transport planes to meet urgent requirements and tackle the problems of an aging fleet, but that purchase had not been planned at the outset, he said.





The French Air Force expects to receive by the end of the year six A400Ms of the ""tactical"" version, Air Chief of Staff Gen. André Lanata told the French Senate Foreign Affairs, Defense and Armed Forces Committee on Oct. 12. Parachute drops are key to that tactical model, he said.





A tactical model is equipped with a protected cabin and a self-defense system to protect the aircrew and aircraft when flying over hostile zones.





""We expect the company concerned to make every single effort to allow us to undertake our very many operational commitments,"" Lanata said.





The A400M engine is now the major concern for the service, as the motors require an inspection every 80 hours, an unsustainable rate leading to fleet availability shortages, he said.





An interim solution to the engine will be delivered between now and Spring 2017 until a permanent remedy is ready, which will make the situation manageable – which it is not right now, he said.





Airbus D&S declined comment on the issue.





Of the six tactical aircraft, three will be new units and three will be retrofits of the A400M aircraft already in service with the Air Force. The service flies eight of these as cargo lifters into secure areas.





France was the first country to receive a tactical version with the June 8 delivery to the Direction Générale de l'Armement procurement office. That plane included cockpit protection for the flight crew, among the contracted tactical capabilities.

The engine problems stem from the Avio propeller gearbox on the TP400-D6 engine from Europrop International, a consortium comprising ITP, MTU Aero Engines, Rolls-Royce and Safran Aircraft Engines.





Avio and its parent General Electric are delivering a modified pinion on the gearbox to fix cracks detected on the gearbox.





Airbus announced July 27 a further €1 billion ($1.1 billion) of financial charges on the A400M program due to the problems on the engine and fuselage. That came on top of €5 billion of charges previously booked for work on the airlifter.

The French Air Force has asked for the A400M to drop a full complement of 116 paratroopers jumping from both sides of the fuselage, with 58 from each side door. The requirements also include refueling helicopters in-flight and self-defense equipment. The service expects to have 11 units by the end of the year, with the three new units boosting the present eight-strong fleet."

The lightweight carbon-fiber plane, 7 meters longer and able to carry 40 more people than A350s already in service, began a three-hour debut flight at 0942 GMT (4:52 a.m. ET), watched by some of the airline bosses who have invested in the $356 million jet.

The 366-seat A350-1000 is designed to break Boeing's <BA.N> virtual monopoly in the lucrative ""mini-jumbo"" segment, typically involving large twin-engined jets carrying 350 people.

It is a larger cousin to the new-generation A350-900, which entered service last year. Both are built from similar advanced materials to Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner in a race between planemakers for fuel savings and better passenger comfort.

The aircraft involved in Thursday's Toulouse debut is one of three test planes facing 1,600 hours of intensive flight testing before the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017.

Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the planemaking division of Airbus Group, told Reuters he was confident the A350-1000 would be delivered on time to launch customer Qatar Airways.

""It makes me very happy and very proud. We are flying according to the timetable we had planned,"" he said moments after the jet, weighing 230 tonnes, took off under leaden skies to applause from factory workers.

While the first flight of its latest model took place on time, Airbus is grappling with delivery delays to the earlier A350-900, clusters of which remain dotted around the airport in Toulouse, France, due to shortages of cabin equipment.

Smaller A320neo jets are also parked with missing engines, due to delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney, highlighting the strain on the industry of adding new technology while securing record production targets.

Airbus programs chief Didier Evrard said the planemaker continued to scrutinize its suppliers, notably France's Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA>, which said this week it was on a path to recovery following a production crisis at its factories.

Asked about the progress displayed by cabin and other suppliers for the A350 family, Evrard told Reuters: ""It has improved, but it is not where it should be and we are watching them very carefully.""

He said the planemaker was working hard to achieve a target of 50 A350-900 deliveries for this year, having reached 34 so far, with a further plane due to be delivered later on Thursday.

""I have already cancelled my holidays,"" he added.

Airbus says the A350-1000 will be 25 percent cheaper to operate than the competing Boeing 777-300ER, an older aircraft which weighs more but which has more seats in some layouts.

Boeing has responded to the A350-1000 by developing an even larger version of 777 able to seat over 400 people, making it the largest twin-engined jet when it enters service in 2020.

Airbus is also considering whether to go up in size with a further stretch of the A350, but senior marketing vice president Francois Caudron said it did not currently deem this necessary.

Industry sources say Airbus is nonetheless offering the potential ""A350-2000"" to influential buyers including Singapore Airlines <SIAL.SI> and British Airways <ICAG.L>.

Such a jet would need an enhancement of the Rolls-Royce <RR.L> Trent XWB engine that powers the A350-1000, already one of the industry's largest with a fan case large enough to swallow the fuselage of the now defunct Concorde.

Chris Young, programs director at the embattled UK engine manufacturer, which is in the midst of restructuring, said it would always be ready if needed to upgrade its engines or add new ones according to the needs of airplane manufacturers."

With the A330neo, Aircalin will boost services to Japan for onward connections and the possible opening of new routes such as to China.“As part of our plan to boost tourism to New Caledonia, Aircalin has made a strategic decision to renew its complete fleet with the A320neo and the A330neo to grow routes and connect New Caledonia to the region,” said Didier Tappero, Aircalin CEO. “The NEO aircraft with its state-of-the-art technology will burn less fuel, lower our operational costs and offer our loyal passengers the highest standards in cabin comfort.”Bernard Deladrière, Chairman of the Board and Member of New Caledonia Government asserted, “Aircalin is taking on an even more strategic step for its future, as it is about its profitability and its competitiveness.”“We are delighted that Aircalin has embraced our best-selling A330neo and A320neo Family aircraft to secure a successful, profitable future, and to grow tourist traffic to New Caledonia,” said Christopher Buckley, Airbus Executive Vice President, Europe Africa and Pacific. “Thanks to the unique commonality between all variants of the A320 and the A330, Aircalin will benefit from a seamless and cost effective transition to these exciting new aircraft, continuing with all the efficiencies they currently enjoy with their existing fleet.The A330neo is the most cost-efficient in its size category, offering a reduction in fuel burn of 14 percent per seat, an increase in non-stop flying range of up to 4000 nautical miles and the lowest maintenance costs of any aircraft.The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with over 12,500 orders since launch and more than 7,000 aircraft delivered to some 400 customers and operators worldwide. Thanks to their widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer unmatched comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18” wide seats in economy as standard."
Airbus looks to define A320 Airspace with tick-tock model in play - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 08 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWxvb2tzLXRvLWRlZmluZS1hMzIwLWFpcnNwYWNlLXdpdGgtdGljay10b2NrLW1vZGVsLWluLXBsYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the recent APEX EXPO in Singapore, the talking points from Airbus EVP strategy & marketing Kiran Rao and VP cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer were around the way key elements in aircraft cabins work together – from inflight connectivity, seatback entertainment and inflight power to the wider passenger experience and the benefits of the Internet of Things – and how advancements adopted on one type can trickle down (or indeed up) in the airframer’s portfolio.

The Airbus A350 version of this discussion is centered on the fact that the twinjet is a naturally “digital native aircraft”, while the A330 and re-engined A330neo will achieve their digital cred through Airbus’ “high-bandwidth connectivity” strategy, which now provides multiple high-speed Internet options to airlines.

Airbus is flight-testing its new High-Bandwidth Connectivity architecture, with retrofit orders from Finnair & Iberia. #PaxEx #APEXEXPO pic.twitter.com/RrP4QAzd39 — John Walton • @thatjohn.bsky.social (@thatjohn) October 25, 2016

As such, the European airframer’s work has begun to echo the “tick-tock” model followed by Intel, Apple and others, where one series of technological and #PaxEx innovations is made on the blanker canvas of the A350 platform, and then rolled out to the legacy A330 and A330neo architecture, as evidenced by the new Airspace cabin for these twinjets. Now Airbus is eyeing Airspace elements for the A320 family of narrowbody aircraft.

The golden thread of this work stretches back through the various A350 and A330neo cabin improvements announced over the past few years, from the recessed seat track power and entertainment cabling to the overhead bins, monuments and overall cabin presentation. Whether this is a carefully planned evolution of the message from Airbus for a twice-yearly cabin interiors news cycle, or whether it is reactive to developments — or perhaps a little of both — is difficult to determine. But the intertwining of the two aircraft is perhaps something that, while not expected, has reaped benefits.

“If you look at how we sold the A330 in the past, how we sold the A350, we tend to sell the aircraft in a pair,” Rao told Runway Girl Network. “So the airlines that buy A350s tend to buy A330s. Airlines that have already bought the A330s tend to buy A350s. And now that we are going into A330neos, airlines are tending to look at if they’ve already got an A350, then they’ll look at an A330neo. The concept that we’ve given to the airlines is that whole look and feel where you feel that you are in the same airplane. It’s right down to the minute detail of the latches on the lavatory doors or on the bins, the lighting features, etcetera. So now when passengers board the airplane, they get that same experience.”

“As you evolve something on the A330neo,” Rao said, “you will evolve it onto the A350. And then we’ll get to a point where we will transfer that down onto the A320s and we’ll transfer stuff up to the A380s. It will all evolve together, and it will take us a while to get to that stage, but let’s say when we get to the 2020s, you’ll start to then see all of the airplanes coming out — looking and feeling — with the Airspace brand.”

So when, RGN asked Rao, will the A320 Airspace cabin start appearing?

“The first A320s with an Airspace, we are already working on today. So we’re looking at what we would do to the entrance area. We are looking what we could do with the bins. We’ve had a program review with customers as to what they are expecting from the new shape of bins. Are they expecting passengers to bring more bags? Is turnaround time so important?”

All of these questions are being addressed at the moment. “So we are marching towards actually defining what an A320neo Airspace cabin would look like,” confirmed Rao.

Wuggetzer was more bullish on the definition dates. “At the latest by 2020,” he said.

With both the development of the A320neo Airspace cabin, and the work Boeing is doing for the 737 MAX family, the next three years look to be ripe with passenger experience developments.

H135 joins Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix family. The new cockpit system reduces workload

Axel Humpert, Head of H135 Programme said: “The certification of the H135 with Helionix marks another milestone in the permanent evolution of this helicopter. The Helionix cockpit system with 4-axis autopilot significantly reduces the workload of the pilot and brings the H135 to an unrivalled level of safety due to the additional functions and mission features it adds to the H135’s capability.”Besides the 4-axis autopilot, Helionix offers an innovative cockpit layout which helps to increase situational awareness. Designed with three large electronic displays, the cockpit is Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible and includes a First Limit Indicator which highlights the appropriate engine instrument data for the pilot in one indicator. Thanks to two touchscreen GPS/Nav/Comm GTN-750, Helionix ensures an all-in-one GPS navigation and communication system. The Traffic Advisory System TAS620A, a system which improves flight safety by assisting pilots in detecting and avoiding aircraft intersecting their flight path, is another key feature delivered by the Helionix avionics suite.Initial deliveries of the H135 with Helionix cockpit will occur in 2017.

Airbus' KID-Systeme has new fix for slide deployment problem - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWtpZC1zeXN0ZW1lLWhhcy1uZXctZml4LWZvci1zbGlkZS1kZXBsb3ltZW50LXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When aircraft emergency evacuation slides deploy by accident, it’s a significant issue, both for cost reasons and for the safety of flight crew, ground staff and passengers. On average, every commercial aircraft will see an inadvertent deployment of at least one emergency evacuation slide. That statistic comes from Airbus’ cabin systems company KID-Systeme, and data from airline trade body IATA suggests that each deployment can cost an airline up to US$200,000. Do the math based on the number of aircraft in a fleet and the scale of the problem becomes apparent.

Inadvertent slide deployment results from a number of causes, ranging from catering, cleaning and maintenance staff mistakes to flight attendant error to a lack of (and difference between) standard operating procedures (SOPs), door design differing between airframers, or technical malfunction — and IATA says it is an ongoing issue.

“There is no one size fits all solution for all operators,” IATA said in March last year. “Strategies to mitigate this problem revolve mostly around good communication, following operator SOPs, the use of onboard technology, and awareness so that cabin crew have the ability to mitigate the disk of a slide deployment.”

Much like the way that different aircraft autothrottles behave differently, the lack of international standardisation on the way that aircraft doors open is a safety concern. Airbus’ handles are largely raised vertically from bottom to top, Boeing’s are rotated around a central pivot, and other smaller airframers vary in their approach. Clearly, there is standardisation work not being done.

In a sign of how little action has been taken, however, KID-Systeme has an option to solve the symptoms even while the cause remains untreated. KID-Systeme’s new onboard technology to fix this PoISD — prevention of inadvertent slide deployment — problem when it comes from inside the cabin is a proximity detector called Watchdog.

In essence, the system detects a hand reaching for the handle and, if the slide is armed, flashes a warning light and then sounds an increasingly insistent warning alarm.

Current warning options are touch based and don’t give enough notice, which means that they don’t sufficiently prevent the inadvertent slide deployment, explains KID-Systeme’s communications executive Maren Muente to Runway Girl Network.

KID-Systeme’s Watchdog device is contained within a small box about the size of four playing card packs, half of which is recessed into the existing door alert slot and half of which sticks out to provide the warning system. Watchdog is likely to most commonly be automatically activated and deactivated with the door arming mechanism.

The details: if, when the slide is armed, Watchdog detects movement within 70 cm — just over two feet — it starts to flash to signal the flight attendant, maintenance worker, catering staffer or cleaner that the door is armed. Within 40 cm — just over a foot — an alarm sounds.

Playing the role of a distracted airline staffer, your RGN journalist attempted to reach for the position where the door handle would be on KID-Systeme’s mockup several times, and each time Watchdog flashed and beeped to an extent highly likely to dissuade the staffer from activating the door.

Watchdog is likely to increase safety and reduce slide deployment as part of a concerted approach, which includes a number of IATA-identified prevention strategies.

In addition to technological innovations, the association recommends establishing better policies and procedures, cabin crew training, and memory aids — including acronyms, door placards and checklists — to standardise the door opening process.

The standardisation of how the doors work, however, is work that has yet to be prioritised.

The New Airbus A350 Will Make Your Noise-canceling Headphones Optional - Yahoo Life,"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXMtMDYxMDA3NDMwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first of Airbus’ new A350-1000 enjoyed a successful first flight last week. It is a “stretch” version of the A350XWB family which uses technology to make flying more comfortable—starting with much less noise.

“The A350 cabin has set the reference for twin-aisle twin-jet long-range aircraft,” said Francois Caudron, senior vice president of marketing at Airbus. “It's spacious and very quiet and we bring more fresh air to the cabin.”

Peace and Quiet

One of the biggest advantages of this aircraft family is that you don’t have to splurge for fancy noise-canceling headphones—unless you really want to.

“An A350 XWB is nine decibels quieter than a Boeing 777-300ER, and it is six decibels quieter than the newer 787 Dreamliner,” Caudron said. “Decibels are not measured in a linear scale—it's an algorithmic scale—so three decibels is actually double the noise energy.”

Caudron says this quieter cabin can also lead to better in-flight service, because it’s a better work environment for flight crew.

“[They’re] in a much better mood to deliver service to the passengers,” Caudron said.

Breathe Easy

The A350XWB also supplies 20 percent more fresh air than other long-haul aircraft models, better environmental controls with eight different temperature zone settings, and an option for humidification in first class and business class similar to private jets.

The A350.

In case you’re wondering why the back of the plane doesn’t get an option for fancy humidifiers, it’s because the greater number of passengers automatically keeps humidity at more comfortable levels. In premium class, fewer passengers results in dryer air.

A Connected Aircraft

Another perk is that Airbus has made this a “digital native” aircraft. Wi-Fi systems can be installed at the Airbus factory, with three connectivity suppliers for airlines to choose from, which makes it easier for airlines to add the service.

“Passengers expect a seamless experience, whether they are on the ground or in the air,” Caudron said. “They want to enjoy their experience but also have a smartphone and tablet with the emails and the social media and network connections in real-time.

“It's a modern aircraft, spacious aircraft, and most of all quiet,” he said. “It's even more important because it's a long-haul aircraft. When you're going to fly for 14 hours long you want to be in a wider seat and in a quiet cabin.”

More Room

Because the A350-1000 is about 23 feet longer, Caudron says airlines have room to add 40 extra seats. Airbus wants to keep those extra 40 comfortable for all with standard 18” seats in a nine-abreast seating configuration for economy class. Every passenger also gets a little extra legroom because the boxes and wires which control the in-flight entertainment are hidden, instead of taking up space under passenger seats.

Everyone seated at a window gets a window—there are no seats up against a wall. These planes also have larger panoramic windows so sky photos will look better on Instagram.

There are also larger overhead bins which can fit more carry-on luggage—enough for at least one carry-on bag per passenger.

Whatever seats an airline picks, the aesthetics of the aircraft are enhanced by the plane’s architecture, which includes very high ceilings that create a sense of space onboard even when you’re sitting at the back.

And the A350-1000 will also have a 40-percent larger premium area, with speculation mounting on just how airlines will turn that to passengers’ advantage.

More Light

A programmable LED ambient lighting system offers airlines a range of 16.7 million colors for airlines to blend, creating settings for different phases of flight.

Finnair uses this setting on its A350 long-haul flights to put on a special Northern Lights show in the dark. Airlines have also programmed the lights to reproduce more natural sunrise and sunset lighting which helps passengers regulate their body clocks to reduce the effect of jet lag.

Qatar's A350 business class.

In all, 11 airlines have placed 195 orders for this new A350-1000, including: Asiana Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Etihad Airways, Japan Airlines, Qatar Airways, United, and Virgin Atlantic. Eight of the A350-1000 customers have also bought the A350-900 model, which reflects airline confidence in the economies and passenger features of this plane."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is preparing to stage the maiden flight of its largest twin-engined airplane, the A350-1000, stepping up a war for sales in a market segment dominated by U.S. rival Boeing.

Barring bad weather that could lead to a postponement, Thursday's roughly three-hour debut will add a new 366-seat member to the lightweight carbon-fibre A350 family, which entered service with the smaller A350-900 early last year.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It is part of a game of leapfrog at the top of the market for twin-engined long-haul jets, as the dominant planemakers vie to outdo each other in size and efficiency in a category expected to generate $1 trillion in orders over the next 20 years.

It is also at the center of a new subsidy row between Europe and the United States at a time of protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic. The World Trade Organization is expected to rule in coming days that Boeing received at least one strand of banned support for its response to the A350-1000, known as the 777X.

Airbus said the A350-1000, a stretched version of the model which entered service last year, was scheduled to take off from its Toulouse base at around 0930 GMT on Thursday, returning there later, in an outing that marks the start of roughly a year of flight testing.

The United States says the plane and its smaller A350 sister model could only get off the drawing board thanks to damaging European subsidies, in a dispute likely to rumble on long after the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017.

The aircraft, which sells for $356 million at list prices, is designed to compete with Boeing's 777-300ER, the most successful version of the U.S. planemaker's popular 777 family.

Airbus hopes it will help it reach 50 percent of wide-body aircraft deliveries, up from 35 percent in 2015. But critics say the aircraft failed to deliver the knockout blow to the older 777 it had hoped, despite an upgrade in engine design.

Airbus has sold 195 new-generation A350-1000s out of 810 total A350 orders, compared with 809 sales of the 777-300ER.

Unwilling to cede a lucrative spot at the top of the market for twin-engined jets, Boeing responded by launching the ""777X"", including the 406-seat 777-9. That has in turn sent its European rival looking for new and bigger solutions.

Even before taking flight, industry sources say the A350-1000 has been eclipsed by a potential 400-seat version called A350-2000 which is being offered to key airlines, though Airbus recently deferred a decision on whether to develop it.

In one final throw of the dice, Boeing is mulling plans for an even larger ""777-10X"" which could seat some 450 people.

Singapore Airlines could make a decision on which of those two concept jets to order by year-end, CNN reported this month.

""The category killer has been the 777-300ER and the A350-1000 fits there. The question is where the market is?: The sweet spot may not be the largest aircraft, but manufacturers don't yet know,"" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham.

The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce .

But by conquering 400 seats, the rise of the ""big twin"" raise questions over demand for slightly larger four-engined jets like the A380 and Boeing 747-8, whose sales are weak.

The trend was highlighted as recently as June. While Airbus celebrated a much-needed order boost from Virgin Atlantic, people familiar with the matter said the airline had decided behind the scenes to cancel its remaining orders for A380s.

Adding to pressure on both planemakers as they stretch their designs, Thursday's debut coincides with a dip in demand for wide-body jets due to a surge of aircraft scheduled to be delivered later this decade and concerns over the economy.

Boeing said last month it saw ""hesitation"" from airlines over such planes, but insisted long-term demand was sound.

Airbus Helicopters to include StartStick as original equipment in fly-away kit - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1pbmNsdWRlLXN0YXJ0c3RpY2stb3JpZ2luYWwtZXF1aXBtZW50LWZseS1hd2F5LWtpdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For years, helicopter operators have asked for improved portable battery solutions for ramp and field operations alike. Now, Aviation Battery Systems (ABS) of Chandler, Arizona, has arranged with Airbus Helicopters of Grand Prairie, Texas, to include the StartStick as part of the fly-away kit with new deliveries of light single helicopters including the popular H125 and H130 models.

This effort means cutting-edge, portable auxiliary power is available for every flight, and is a value-add for new aircraft owners.

“We are committed to helping aircraft owners and OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] alike achieve maximum operational effectiveness, and are excited to partner with Airbus Helicopters U.S. in this effort,” says ABS’ Scott Urschel. “The StartStick series of stowable start batteries is the best technology of its kind, in a lightweight, reliable package.”

StartStick portable power is not only peace of mind; it’s a critical piece of mission equipment improvement. An aircraft unable to leave a medical scene, rooftop helipad or platform due to main battery issues is not only a major availability problem, but also a potential life safety threat to air medical patients.

Recognizing this challenge, ABS has developed and fielded this new class of rugged, lightweight ‘StartStick’ stowable start batteries.

The StartStick comes in two versions; a 10-pound standard StartStick and 14-pound StartStick fleet model. Each unit can provide multiple starts of single- and twin-engine helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft before recharge, via standard ground power units (GPU) power ports on a range of aircraft.

Unlike other battery products in the market, StartStick comes with a comprehensive two-year warranty.

StartStick is ideal for unsupported landing zones. At fixed bases, crews simply walk out to the aircraft, plug in the StartStick and power up for the mission. For avionics work, the StartStick can be run as aux power supply. Heavy GPUs are no longer needed.

Units are designed for years of reliable field service with an industry-leading warranty, and have achieved the very demanding UNDOT durability certification.

StartStick can be recharged during flight via onboard 28-volt connections, or plugged into a hangar wall socket. An integrated charger provides full redundancy and internal microprocessor with readout gives on-condition assessment of state of charge.

Urschel, a high-time commercial helicopter pilot, says, “ABS is committed to improving the helicopter industry via the fielding of new technologies. We know the frustration of a dead battery in the midst of flight ops. Whether the main battery is degraded due to age, or power left on during a static PR event, reality is that anyone and any program type can experience unexpected battery failures.”

ABS reports that a variety of air medical, corporate, fire/utility and airborne law enforcement programs are all deploying the StartStick, filling the critical need for mission reliability and showing importance of portable, lightweight power source offerings for helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft."

Fencer and Engineer Astrid Guyart - Airbus,"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTExLWZlbmNlci1hbmQtZW5naW5lZXItYXN0cmlkLWd1eWFydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fencing master Astrid Guyart is an inspiration both on and off the field: this aerospace ambassador has become world champion while developing a successful career at Airbus Defence and Space.

A fencing match is like running the hundred metres whilst playing chess at the same time.



Astrid Guyart was five when she held a foil for the first time. It was at a fencing club in a western suburb of Paris, where her older brother had been training for two years. “The fencing master said, ‘It’s your turn,’” she remembers. “I couldn’t wait to attack.”

Training together while playing Zorro at home, the siblings both went on to become fencing champions. “The beauty of fencing is that anyone can beat anyone by using his own strength or turning the opponent’s strengths into his weaknesses,” she says.

A fascinating mystery

Astrid competes in foil. Compared to the other two fencing disciplines – épée and sabre – it requires more technique, as only the upper body and the front of the neck can be hit by the tip.

Astrid’s passion for space also emerged in early childhood, immersing herself in books on the formation of the Universe. “I was fascinated. Deep inside, I have always wanted to be part of the great space adventure.”

Today, she works as an aerospace engineer and improvement project coach at Airbus Defence and Space in Les Mureaux, France. Her part-time schedule fits around her intense Olympic training sessions.

“Fencing brings you face-to-face with yourself,” says Astrid of her sport, which sounds like good training for life. “You need rock-solid mental stability and very clear thinking to adapt instinctively to the situation and avoid the traps set by your opponent.”

You have just one day of competition to prove your hardwork. How do you manage the pressure?

The key is to focus on the moment. If you think about the stakes of the competition, or question whether you’ll win or lose, you are no longer in the moment. To silence this internal monologue, you have to find an attention point (for me, it’s the distance between me and my opponent). When you get in this zone, all your abilities can come out automatically. There is no more room for pressure, there is only the right action at the right moment!

How do you balance your career at Airbus with being an elite athlete?

For many years, I worked to conceive a new generation of space vehicles. But the project schedules were hardy compatible with my daily trainings and competitions. Thus, I found a compromise: I’m now an improvement coach and change agent where I can put into practice the soft skills I’ve learned in my sport career to build collective efficiency. I emphasise the need for building on one’s strengths to make a difference. Each of us has an area in which we can excel.

Why did you want to join the aerospace industry?

Space is still a big mystery. There is so much to discover and understand and I like it that way. The fact that we don’t really know why we’re here and how everything started is quite humbling, and helps us humans keep our feet on the ground. After working on Ariane 6 development in the past, I would love to be involved in production or launch activities later on in my career.

Astrid, you’re also about to publish Les Incroyables Rencontres de Jo, a collection of books for children.

My books are a way to pass on to kids my experience and all I’ve learned about human resources during my sports career. In the books, sport is a pretext to the personal development of the little hero named JO (acronym for “Jeux Olympiques” in French). In each episode, Jo will meet other children, each of whom will go on to become one of France’s sports champions. Thus, it is also about a positive mind-set and life values.

"A milestone 42 years in the making – Airbus delivers its 10,000th airliner - Royal Aeronautical Society","Fri, 04 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zb2NpZXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2EtbWlsZXN0b25lLTQyLXllYXJzLWluLXRoZS1tYWtpbmctYWlyYnVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWl0cy0xMC0wMDB0aC1haXJsaW5lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 14 October Airbus celebrated the historic milestone of the delivery of its 10,000th airliner - an A350-900 for Singapore Airlines. TIM ROBINSON looks back on the lessons for other would-be entrants aiming to break into the airliner duopoly.

It was highly appropriate that at a glitzy ceremony on 14 October in Toulouse, France, the airline that took delivery of Airbus’s 10,000th airliner – a milestone 42 years in the making – was its valued long-term customer Singapore Airlines (launch customer for the A380 back in 2007). This particular A350-900 is the sixth delivery to the airline in 2016 after it received the first of 67 in March – leading to SIA chief Goh Choon Phong to quip that he: “didn’t expect to be back [in Toulouse] so soon.”

Singapore Airlines has already put the specially-marked A350 into service on its new non-stop Singapore-San Francisco service. It is also looking forward to putting the ultra-long range A350-900ULR variant (seven of which it has on order) into service in 2018 on its highly anticipated Singapore-New York and Los Angeles direct routes.

The handover event, which saw airline guests, Airbus veterans and media mark this milestone, was perhaps a good occasion to ponder – how did Airbus get here in the first place?



A model for successful European integration

Where it all began - the first A300B2 delivered to Air France in 1974. (Airbus)

Airbus as a European (and now global) enterprise has long roots – but can be traced back to the failures of individual national aerospace industries, primarily in the UK and France, to regain the lost lead in civil aviation they enjoyed prior to WW2. Civil airliners such as the VC10 (54 built), BAC One-Eleven (244), Caravelle (282) Dassault Mecure (12) and VFW-Fokker 614 (19) failed to match US competitors such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 (386) Lockheed L-1011 (250) and Boeing 727 (1,832). Co-operation – first in Concorde and military aviation projects showed a way where Europe could pool its industrial resources to produce an airliner that could make a significant breakthrough into mass market global sales.

Indeed, the Anglo-French co-operation in Concorde makes an interesting what-if case of alternate aviation history. If supersonic passenger travel had taken off in the way in which it was originally predicted (MoUs were signed for over 100 aircraft from airlines of the day), would Airbus partners have had their hands full producing SSTs and follow-on designs?



Introducing the widebody

An Airbus Industrie marketing brochure for the A300B in 1974 highlighted the cabin space.

But even before the 1970s, the then Airbus partners were thinking about a new airliner. The first one was the A300 – which would break new ground in being a twin-aisle widebody, powered by only two engines – at a time when its competitors had either four or three. Reliability of powerplants had not yet reached the levels that airlines enjoy today – which meant that many were suspicious of a large airliner powered by only two engines – especially from an unknown European consortium with a history of poor-selling airliners.

An Airbus Industries market analysis from May 1969 predicted a world total market potential of around 1,000 aircraft by 1980, and that of these, the A300B could capture 50 sales in 1975 and about 150 in 1980. Particularly important for the A300B, notes the study, was the growth of European non-scheduled operators, or charter airlines, in the second half of the 1970s, as the package holiday boom took off.

Interestingly, as well as European holidaymakers, an Airbus A300B marketing brochure from five years later, in 1974, also pointed to the growing European IT market as driving passenger growth.

Oddly, the A300B almost had free rein as a widebody twin until Boeing launched the 767 in 1982. A RAeS Lecture ‘Co-operation in European Aerospace – The A300B widebody twin’ given by Programme Director Roger Béteille in March 1973 noted that “the DC-10 is already produced in three different versions with the possibility of a twin-engine version to come.” What then, might have happened had Lockheed or McDonnell Douglas quickly moved to produce twin-jet versions of their tri-jets?

Could the BAC Three-Eleven have ended up splitting orders between it and the A300? (RAeS/NAL)

Ironically the closest rival to the A300B was perhaps from Britain with BAC’s (who unlike Hawker Siddeley was not an Airbus Industries partner) Three-Eleven – a scaled up T-tail twin jet widebody concept which was showcased at the Paris Air Show in 1967/1969 and had disappeared by 1971. Had this rival widebody gone ahead and split any orders and sales, says Professor Keith Hayward wryly: “It would have torpedoed both UK and European aviation industries”.

First delivered to Air France in May 1974, Airbus finally went on to deliver 561 A300s - a quantum leap in sales compared to previous efforts – and the A310 following suit. However, it was a slow process with a gap of 12 years between the first flights of the A300 and A310. Observed Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders at the delivery “In the 1970s we were producing at a rate of half an aircraft a month.”

It thus took 19 years for the consortium to reach 1,000 deliveries (an A340 delivered to Air France in 1993. Yet, the last 1,000 airliners delivered, incredibly only took 19 months from the 9,000th – an A321 delivered to VietJetAir in 2015.

After the A310, followed the, A320, A340 and A330 (ironically at the time it was the four-engined A340 that was seen as the flagship product, whereas today the A330 has won new sales and is getting a revamp with the A330neo). Finally, there was the four-engined A380 ‘super jumbo’ and today's A350.



Lessons

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders at the glittering handover ceremony - the company will deliver its next 10,000 airliners in just 10 years he said.

So what lessons can we draw from Airbus’ experience in taking on the dominant US civil aerospace industry – seeing off two major competitors in civil aviation (Lockheed withdrawing and McDonnell Douglas merging with Boeing)?

This week, all eyes have been on Zhuhai air show in China – both paradoxically Airbus and Boeing’s potentially biggest market and their most likely future competitor – among other countries developing smaller jets such as Brazil and Japan. Bombardier, meanwhile, has struggled to secure sales for its CSeries. Can China or any of these other new entrants, repeat this success story?

The first lesson – is that it takes time. As Tom Enders notes, it took 19 years to pass the 1,000 delivery mark. This then requires deep pockets and/or some sort of government support. If we take the ARJ21 as the starting point for AVIC (302 orders so far) it entered service in 2016. Therefore, it could conceivably be 20 years or 2036 before AVIC reaches the 1,000 delivery mark (COMACs C919 has 517 orders – so it could reach that earlier, but it has yet to fly).

However, even if China builds on western expertise, it will still take time. Trust will have to be earned and it is in the aftermarket support and services where the biggest challenges to any new entrants to airliner business are. Forging the kind of global supplier, services and training network that will allow an airline with an aircraft on the ground (AOG) anywhere from Argentina to Zambia to pick up a phone and get an assured 24/7 response may take decades. For this reason, China’s AVIC is likely to concentrate on its home market first.

Price is obviously another discriminator – and an attractive one for a new entrant hoping to win initial customers through some ‘too-good-to-resist’ deals, but today there are fewer and fewer airlines that would be willing to risk a bargain basement deal unless there was some level of guaranteed customer support afterwards. Unlike military aircraft, airliners fly much more often and today’s manufacturers target levels of dispatch reliability of above 98% for new models and over 99% for mature aircraft.



Innovating to leap ahead

Can Russia and China's widebody C929 challenge the Airbus/Boeing duopoly? (OAC)

The second lesson from Airbus is that it had to innovate further and push the technology farther rather than offer a ‘me-too’ product. It is debatable, for instance, if it had launched a tri-jet in the age of the L-1011, DC-10 and 727 whether it would have had the same impact as the world’s first widebody twin in the A300. By losing the third engine, it immediately offered fuel efficiencies.

In the A320 too, the world’s first fly-by-wire (FBW) airliner, Airbus pushed the frontiers of flight. Today the single-aisle A320 is its ‘bread and butter’ product with over 7,200 built and the revamped neo flying off the shelves. Yet marketing it initially was an uphill struggle and Airbus faced fierce resistance from pilots’ unions concerned about this then unproven (FBW) technology – especially when the company suffered a high-profile crash at an airshow in Germany in 1988. Today, FBW is taken as standard and available on smaller and smaller jets – but then its safety advantages were still unknown. The reputation of Airbus as having ‘computers in charge’ is one that still echoes today – especially after incidents such as AF447. Yet despite well-publicised incidents, fatal aviation accidents remain rare and have not kept pace with the massive growth in air travel. Thus ongoing innovation such as two-crew flightdecks, increased use of composites, FBW, common crew ratings and ETOPS allowed Airbus to differentiate itself from the established competition and win market share.

Conversely, it is noticeable that the one time that Airbus felt it needed a ‘me too’ product to compete with Boeing’s flagship 747, it has come unstuck – with the A380 arriving just at the time when twin widebodies such as the 777/787 and A330/A350 are carrying more passengers and becoming more efficient.

So in China’s case, if the ARJ21 can be seen a test project to learn the ins and outs of airliner development and certification, COMAC’s C919 perhaps is still too much of a ‘me- too’ A320-alike to make sufficient inroads outside of Chinese airlines (although both Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary and IAG’s, Willie Walsh, have flirted with COMAC).

All eyes now, therefore, will be on the C929 – a joint Sino-Russian widebody. Partnering Chinese resources with Russian know-how in aerodynamics could make for a dream team to challenge Airbus and Boeing – but the question remains – in order to convince airlines, what fresh innovation in terms of efficiencies, safety improvements or cabin comfort will this bring?



Listen to the market - carefully

The A350 became a clean-sheet design after the original A330 revamp failed to impress customers. (Airbus)

The final lesson might be - listen to the market, but listen carefully. For instance, Airbus’ first pass at the A350, a made-over A330, resulted in a lukewarm reception from potential customers leading to a complete redesign and the current A350XWB. Faced with the decision of ploughing ahead with a clean-sheet new single-aisle airliner or revamping the existing A320 with promising new engines from P&W and CFM, Airbus wisely chose the re-engining option – producing its best-ever selling airliner in the A320neo. While in hindsight this decision seems obvious, (next generation engines such as open-rotors seem to be still 10-15 years away) at the time there was pressure for radically efficient airliners to cope with soaring prices as the world faced ‘peak oil’. The key lesson here, then, is ‘what are your customers really telling you’?



Deep pockets

Airliner manufacturing is a complex, long-term business. (Airbus)

Finally, while allegations over state aid and subsidies continue to fly across the Atlantic, there is no doubt that developing a hugely complex and highly expensive product like a new large airliner requires some sort of Government political support – whether it comes in the form of launch aid, tax breaks, investment incentives, military R&D spin-offs or pressure on national flag carriers to buy a product from the ‘home team’.

While Boeing has fumed about this and it continues to be a live issue, Airbus has benefited from the fact that as a pan-European entity is has been able to draw on support (whether economic or political) from multiple governments. While sometimes this has proved to be more of a hindrance in political meddling it has however meant that Airbus was less likely to have been abandoned in its early years than if it only had been a single nation's project.

The lesson here is that airliner manufacturing is a high-stakes game with a high entry fee. (As is aero engines too – witness China establishing a new $7.5bn jet engine manufacturer this year to catch-up in this critical area where it is still dependent on foreign technology).

Yet if governments supporting aerospace (one way or the other) as national strategic industrial assets can be expected - it is only part of the story. Russia, for example, despite state-backing and a formidable military aviation sector, has struggled to compete in civil aerospace. Today, only 29 of Aeroflot's 180-strong fleet are Russian-built Superjet 100s - the rest are Western Airbus and Boeing designs. Political backing or investment may be important, but if the product is not commercially attractive in the first place, success is unlikely.

Summary



Snog, Marry, Avoid? - Who would have predicted in the late 1960s and early 1970s it would be the A300 that would still be in service today? (RAeS/NAL)

Today Airbus delivers more than 600 aircraft a year and sits on a decade worth of backlog of 6,749 airliners – a far cry from the 1970s where it believed that in 1980 it could sell around 150 A300Bs. Indeed, says Professor Hayward, the A300B, where the story began, was “only ranked third” in French industrial planning after Concorde and the Caravelle. In a game of ‘Marry, Snog, Avoid’ of 70s European airliners, it was thus the frumpy A300B (and follow-on aircraft) who the airlines ended up marrying, despite a brief dalliance with glamourpuss Concorde. The poor Caravelle, meanwhile was left (metaphorically speaking) on the shelf. Once it was obvious, though, that Concorde and the Caravelle were not going to be big sales successes – support was swiftly switched to the A300B.

Thus, while the history of Airbus is tied to Franco-German political determination to rebuild their aircraft industries (and some canny commercial dealing by Britain’s Hawker Siddeley), Airbus is now throwing off its state-backed shackles and past as a European job creation scheme to embrace a global, more Silicon Valley-style future of digitisation, innovation and collaboration.

Indeed, it is perhaps the ultimate irony that Airbus - as a model of successful European co-operation has reached this milestone of 10,000 deliveries just when Europe itself seems to be fracturing at the seams.

Can others emulate its (and Boeing’s) success in airliners? In the long-term yes – but it has been a long struggle for Airbus to get where it is - and its success was far from assured. This makes it all the more remarkable that a European company has produced over 10,000 airliners – when previously Europe’s biggest selling jet airliner failed to get past even 500.

2nd US License for Airbus to Sell Planes to Iran - Financial Tribune,"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG9tZXN0aWMtZWNvbm9teS81NDIwNS8ybmQtdXMtbGljZW5zZS1mb3ItYWlyYnVzLXRvLXNlbGwtcGxhbmVzLXRvLWlyYW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The United States says it has issued a second license to France’s Airbus to sell commercial planes to Iran Air, bringing Iran’s flag carrier a step closer to receiving new western jets under last year’s deal to ease sanctions.

The move in the waning months of Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration to further unlock jetliner sales to Iran prompted complaints from Republicans in Congress and is likely to raise the ire of president-elect Donald Trump.

Trump has said he would dismantle the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, which includes a measure allowing US and European companies to sell Iran civilian aircraft, Reuters reported.

Some sanctions experts say licenses allowing such sales could easily be withdrawn by the Trump administration if he chose to do so. But he would likely face opposition from US allies and other world powers who were partners in negotiating the deal to lift some sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting the scope of its nuclear program.

The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Monday issued the license for the sale of 106 planes to Iran Air, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, on condition of anonymity.

An Airbus spokesman confirmed that the company had received the OFAC license, but declined to confirm the exact number of planes approved.

The second license comes after Airbus Spokesman Justin Dubon’s September announcement of the first such permits having been issued. Dubon said the first 17 planes would be A320s and A330s. He declined to offer a breakdown of how many of each are involved in the initial sale.

Although Airbus is based in France, it must have US approval to sell planes to Iran because at least 10% of the aircraft’s components are American-made. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year.

Before the license was issued on Monday, Airbus had US permission for the sale of 17 jets to Iran.

Members of Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the license.

Opponents of the nuclear deal argue that passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes, such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria, something Iranian officials deny.

The US Treasury says that the licenses it issues contain strict conditions to require planes be used solely for commercial passenger use and not be sold or transferred to a sanctioned person or group.

Republicans Aim to Sabotage Deals

Last week, the US House of Representatives passed a bill intending to block the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, which would also affect sales by the US firm Boeing.

The measure is unlikely to become law during the current Congress, as it would need to pass the Senate, where it would face stiff opposition from Democrats. The White House also said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate.

On Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce sent a letter to Obama asking him to refrain from trying to boost international investment in Iran or issuing new regulations, licenses or guidance on remaining sanctions in the last two months of his administration.

McCarthy said in a statement on Tuesday that Obama should not allow for the Airbus sale.

“Actions like this underscore the need for the upcoming Trump Administration to review all options when it comes to this failed deal,” the statement said.

State Dept. Denies Obama “Final Push”

Confirming a Reuters report on the issuing of a second license, the US State Department said the Obama administration was not trying to push through Iran-related measures on its way out.

“It’s very much in keeping with our commitment to meeting our obligations under the JCPOA,” said State Department Spokesman John Kirby, using an acronym for the nuclear deal, in a press briefing. “There’s no final push. This particular license that we’re talking about today isn’t new. It is something that has been in train for quite some time, as other licenses have been as well. There’s no Machiavellian intent here to push in any way outside the bounds of our normal commitments and obligations here in the final months of the administration.”

Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Obama’s hallmark foreign policy achievements.

The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to Iran Air would help modernize and expand the country’s aging fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions.

Iranian officials have voiced growing concerns about what they see as unfair delays in obtaining US licenses, or clarity over banking and financing rules.

Some sanctions experts say Treasury licenses allowing such aircraft sales and easing the way for other commerce with Iran could easily be reversed by Trump if he chose to do so.

“The licenses can be withdrawn at any moment ... so long as they’re not required by legislation, which is a very small number,” said David Mortlock, a former White House sanctions official.

Iran: Int’l Leasing Firm to Finance Deals

The airplane deals still face major obstacles, including reluctance from major European banks to finance deals involving Iran.

Nonetheless, Iran’s Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Development Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan has announced that Iran has finalized a deal to finance the purchase of 77 passenger aircraft from Airbus.

“The purchase, which is in the form of long-term lease finance, will be financed by an international leasing company,” Fakhrieh-Kashan, who is directly involved in negotiations with Airbus and Boeing, was quoted as saying by Mehr News Agency on Tuesday.

He did not mention the name of the lessor.

On November 7, Reuters quoted unnamed Iranian officials as saying that Tehran had reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus.

Although officials have not named the leasing company involved, industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with Dubai Aerospace—the largest aircraft leasing firm in the Middle East—to help finance the purchase, the report added.

Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran’s order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country’s flag carrier Iran Air, it explained.

The Airbus spokesman said that taken together, the company’s two Treasury licenses cover its entire 118-plane deal with Iran, implying that there is some overlap between the two licenses.

Some aircraft have been cancelled because of delays in receiving authorizations and officials say Iran no longer plans to take delivery of A380 superjumbos, so the final tally is likely to be closer to 100 aircraft."
FLIGHT TEST: We run the rule over Airbus Helicopters' H135 - Flightglobal,"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3Qtd2UtcnVuLXRoZS1ydWxlLW92ZXItYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWgxMzUvMTIyMjM4LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flight International first test-flew the H135 in 1998 – when it was still known as the EC135 and manufactured by Eurocopter – so I was curious to see what improvements have been made since.

Our invite from Airbus Helicopters was to fly the latest Helionix-equipped variant at its Donauwörth factory in Germany.

One of the biggest changes for the current P3/T3-standard helicopter from earlier iterations is the increase in maximum take-off weight (MTOW), from 2,720kg (5,600lb) to the present 2,980kg.

The flight-test aircraft was fully loaded to this figure, although Airbus Helicopters went even further, putting in another 20kg of fuel to take account of time spent on the ground receiving a through briefing from chief experimental test pilot Alexander Neuhaus.

This ensured that when we pulled up into our first hover, we were at 2,980kg – a nice touch. No doubt operators will be encouraged to do likewise to get maximum range and endurance for their flights.

Our aircraft was a prototype to test various systems and equipment, so there were no passenger seats to try, but as with most all-rounders, there are a variety of interiors available. The standard passenger transport layout comes with five rear and two cockpit seats.

The H135 will be capable of carrying an underslung load of 1,400kg and internal configurations can be changed from one role to another in about 10min, the manufacturer says.

Airbus Helicopters has accumulated 300h of flight testing on the new Helionix system and, at the time of writing, certification was imminent ahead of first delivery next year.

Neuhaus ran through the limitations section in the as-yet-unpublished flight manual, which show that the maximum all-up weight of 2,980kg can be maintained to quite hot and high conditions before being restricted. The outside ground effect and inside ground effect hover weight ceilings are also high, allowing the operator great flexibility, especially in hot climates.

The aircraft is cleared up to 20,000ft, which is impressive considering the thin air at that altitude. It can hover at up to 16,000ft in ground effect and operate in outside air temperatures from -35°C (-31°F) to ISA +39°C, up to a maximum of +50°C.

The basic payload available with full fuel plus pilot is 780kg. Standard fuel tanks give a total of 560kg. Endurance with no reserves is about 3.4h, but additional fuel tanks are available as an option.

Although the flight manual forbids all aerobatic manoeuvres, loads from -0.5g up to +2g at maximum aircraft weight have been demonstrated by the test pilots, running up to 3.5g at lighter weights – close to the 4g I have pulled in a combat/attack helicopter.

These g levels are undoubtedly sustainable due to the bearingless, rigid rotor system. The design requires little maintenance, has few moving parts and provides long-life rotor blades and low drag levels.

The H135 can be started and stopped in winds up to 50kt (93km/h), a rare attribute for a helicopter. These characteristics will undoubtedly give pilots confidence that they can, if need be, indulge in some vigorous handling to recover, say, from a potentially hazardous situation. In addition, the rotor also helps landing on slopes: the H135 will take 14° sideways on, 12° upslope and 8° downslope. The main rotor blades are 10cm longer than those on the previous P2/T2 iteration and also incorporate an increased twist.

Another advantage of this modern rotor is the swift recovery from vortex ring state/settling with power. This is a phenomenon peculiar to helicopters when a high rate of descent with little forward speed causes the airflow over the main rotor to be disturbed enough to, in extreme cases, cause loss of control. The H135 can be quickly flown out of this condition, says Neuhaus, by moving the cyclic stick forward.

Although there are some wind speed restrictions in some sectors, the H135 can be hovered and landed in all directions. This is useful for search and rescue, offshore and other operations where the pilot may not have any choice. Because it can be started in relatively high winds it is good for search and rescue operations when the helicopter has to go, no matter what the weather conditions.

While the aircraft cannot be flown with no hydraulics for the pilot’s controls, the two systems are fully redundant, says Neuhaus, so the loss of both is very unlikely.

The other unlikely loss of both systems is with the engines. Neuhaus says Airbus Helicopters has not required engines-out landings to be performed by its test pilots, as a double failure is considered a remote possibility.

While we did not carry out an autorotation during our flight, Neuhaus says the average rate of descent for the H135 is 2,200ft/min. This is fairly high for a helicopter of its size, but could be useful if the pilot needs to get down quickly for some reason.

The H135’s engines – either the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206BB or the Safran Helicopter Engines Arrius 2B2+ – are the same as the earlier version, but the full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) management has been adjusted. My test aircraft was fitted with the French-built turboshafts.

The aircraft is equipped with an ice detector, but flight in icing conditions is prohibited. Western helicopter manufacturers have not yet caught up with the Russians, who manage to operate theirs in fairly severe icing.

Airbus Helicopters has tried hard to make the H135 environment-friendly by reducing its noise signature, cutting airframe and other sources of drag so as to require less power, adding more efficient engines, dropping empty weight and other measures, such as lowering the rotor speed in certain conditions thanks to the modified FADEC.

As well as the optional traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), there is a helicopter terrain avoidance, awareness and warning system (HTAWS), which alerts the pilot if the aircraft is getting too close to an obstruction. If, say, carrying out a mountain rescue close to a cliff, the HTAWS can be muted, but only for 5min.

The never-exceed speed (Vne) is the same as the earlier model: 150kt. It is calculated automatically in flight and the pilot warned if it is exceeded. As usual, the test pilots have taken the aircraft to Vne +10%. The H135 is quite benign at 165kt, says Neuhaus, even at maximum weight. A Vne short red line is displayed on the airspeed strip for the pilot to see.

Airbus Helicopters has computerised many tasks. This includes the pre-flight authorisation and acceptance. I went with Neuhaus to accept the aircraft, which he did by just offering his card to a computer screen. If the aircraft has not been prepared and signed for by the technician, the system will not accept the pilot’s input – a clever but simple safety feature. If on an operation with no engineer, the system can be modified for the pilot to pre-flight the aircraft and accept it.

Our density altitude for the flight was a mere 500ft with only about 3kt of wind. Visibility was good, the cloud base high. I followed Neuhaus round his pre-flight inspection. No panels are opened, essential oil and other levels are evident and it takes just a few minutes. I noted the wire strike protection at the front and the wide sliding passenger doors which close totally flush. Litters can be loaded easily through these or the two rear clamshell doors.

Neuhaus pointed out the modified fenestron shrouded tail rotor, which is high enough to allow the loading of litters, baggage and freight through the rear clamshell doors with rotors running.

Another safety feature is that the main gearbox has a dry-run capability of at least 25min, which should give enough time to land somewhere in the unlikely event of total loss of oil. The belly and undercarriage are crash resistant, and the fuel system is designed to survive a heavy or crash landing without spillage.

The floor is level all the way to the cockpit. The panel dividing the cabin from the rear bay can be removed quickly to provide a voluminous storage area. It has numerous tie-down rings and is stressed for 600kg/m². The Helionix version allows the rear baggage bay to be removed to give additional floor space.

Experimental flight test engineer Jurgen Steiner accompanied us on the flight and was very helpful explaining some of the design features.

BillyPix

I climbed easily into the right-hand seat with its five-point harness. All the seats will be crash resistant and have shoulder harnesses with an automatic locking system and headrests to help prevent whiplash injuries. The pilot’s seat and tail rotor pedals can be adjusted to allow full access to all the cockpit equipment and displays. This is important since the aircraft, like its predecessor, will be certified for single pilot instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions. The left-hand cockpit seat can be turned 180° for a systems operator.

The instrument panel is of the latest Airbus Helicopters design and completely computerised. It belongs to the same Helionix family as found on the H145 and H175. It can provide whatever information the pilot selects. The outstanding feature is the single 15.5cm x 20.5cm (6in x 8in) panel in front of the pilot which contains all the information required to operate the aircraft: attitude, heading, speed, rate of climb/descent, route, altitude, power, terrain and collision avoidance, for example.

This makes flying it much easier than in other aircraft where the pilot has to continually scan through various instruments. The pilot can bring up whatever is required on to the screen, and there are no dials or needles.

All presentations are colour coded – green for normal, amber means caution, pilot awareness and subsequent response, white requires pilot awareness and may require pilot response, and red is for getting the pilot’s attention and immediate response.

Every limit is associated with an audio cue. This is good for a pilot who has his head out of the cockpit for, say long-line underslung operations. There are no temperature and pressure gauges on the display. These parameters are monitored discretely and brought to the pilot’s attention only if there is an anomaly.

Both the cyclic stick and the collective lever have enough buttons on them for the pilot to be able to conduct the whole flight without removing their hands from them. The exception is when the aircraft is flown by the four-axis autopilot: it is then operated with hands and feet off all the controls.

In among the screens is the standby attitude indicator. In the event of a total loss of all the displays, this small instrument (5cm x 9cm) has enough information for the pilot to continue to fly, approach and land safely. It shows attitude, airspeed and height/altitude. It has its own battery supply, so is independent from the main systems.

All-round visibility is good. I was to take particular advantage of this when we went vertically down on to the landing spot from 200ft.

Unlike some other similar-sized helicopters I have flown, there is plenty of storage space for the various articles that we pilots like to take on board, plus the essential manuals.

The aircraft is fully equipped with all the latest aids and communications equipment. Switches and other equipment on the overhead panel are, thankfully, kept to a minimum and are easily reached from the pilot’s seat. Vital systems have backup or redundancy, thus providing a high level of safety of operations. This is especially important and relevant for single-pilot IFR flights.

Neuhaus went logically through the cockpit to set it up for engines start. He did it from memory using a simple flow pattern and took just a few minutes. He started both engines in quick succession by moving two switches and sitting back to observe and monitor. If in a hurry, such as for a rescue mission, the aircraft can be made ready to fly within about 2min. Once all the automatic pre-flight checks have been done, the pilot is presented with a green “all systems go” light, another nice touch.

My first hover was easy, requiring very little input from me. A glance at the power needle showed that we had plenty of power in hand at this maximum all-up weight. Likewise when we hovered out of ground effect. Handling during sideways, backwards and spot turns in both directions was similarly benign.

I invited Neuhaus to take over control and carry out these manoeuvres at high speed while following him through on the controls. He went sideways at 30kt in both directions and I noted that there was still pedal available at this speed. Rearwards at 30kt showed no tendency for the nose to suddenly drop as in some other helicopters I have flown; this can not only be disconcerting when close to the ground, but can also be hazardous.

I did not time Neuhaus’s 360° spot turns, but they were fast. There was still some pedal availability in both directions, but more importantly in recovery to the hover, when a bootfull is required.

I glanced at the power indication during all of this and found it easy to interpret. It changed colours as power was increased. Maximum power available was easily seen. The pilot does not need to memorise any numbers: it is all done with colours and presentations. We did not get anywhere near maximums during these extreme manoeuvres at maximum weight.

We climbed up to cruise altitude and did some, for me, reasonably tight turns in both directions. I invited Neuhaus to go steeper at this high weight. At 60° in both directions, there were no signs of any aerodynamic distress.

To give pilots realistic engine-failure practice in some helicopters, you have to use full single-engine power, but this reduces the life of the engine. The modern helicopters I have test flown now have a training mode, selectable on the H135 by pressing a single button.

Once done, the engine indications immediately went to a realistic single-engine presentation, with the only exception that they were highlighted with a T in a triangle. Our right hand engine – the “good” one – showed full power.

An automatic countdown started going from yellow to red when the full-power time limit was approaching. This was accompanied by real rotor speed droop, which I restored by lowering the collective lever slightly. If it droops more than 12%, as yet another safety feature, the “failed” engine power will be restored automatically. In reality, to protect the life of the engine, no more than maximum continuous power is used. Another single click restored us to normal twin-engine configuration.

To complete our flight, Neuhaus demonstrated the many hands- and feet-off automatic pilot characteristics. The autopilot has four axes – pitch, roll, yaw and collective. The pilot can adjust any of the attitude or flight modes (pitch, roll, yaw, heading, rate of descent/climb) by use of a single button. If weather conditions are so bad that the aircraft cannot be flown safely, using this autopilot should get him/her out of trouble. Likewise, if the pilot gets into an excessively unstable condition, two clicks will cause the aircraft to revert to straight and level.

Neuhaus then demonstrated auto-hover and the ability to tweak it gently left, right, backwards or heading change. Ideal for search and rescue missions when recovering someone down below, in the sea, say. Similarly, hover height can be adjusted. This was highlighted at the end of our final automatic approach back to base.

If the pilot has his/her head out of the cockpit and a malfunction or other warning pops up, they are alerted by sound. They can then return to the cockpit and press a button to bring up the message: another well thought-out safety feature.

To complete our flight, Neuhaus set up a hands- and feet-off automatic instrument approach back to the H circle at the Airbus Helicopters base. The choice of approach glide slope is up to 10° for non-precision and up to 6° for a precision glide slope such as ILS. These generous limits take full advantage of a helicopter’s capabilities. The pilot can select any parameters for acquisition of the final glide slope – direction of capture, height, speed, rate of descent and the like. The whole profile is presented on the pilot’s screen. The aircraft will automatically level off at 50ft after a precision approach such as an ILS, or 100ft for non-precision.

Because there are some high trees on the instrument approach to Donauwörth, Neuhaus selected a 10° glide slope. The autopilot followed all of the parameters set up. These were seen clearly on the pilot’s screen. The aircraft flew us down, hands and feet off, to a 200ft hover over the H. Neuhaus then wound us down to 3ft and invited me to take control and land.

The shut-down, like the start-up, was logical and easy, despite the many sophisticated systems involved. Any serious limitation deviations or mechanical issues are recorded and can be downloaded.

The overall impression is that although technically the aircraft is complex, it is extremely pilot-friendly to operate, has many safety features and, in most cases, more than enough power to carry out demanding tasks, such as a high-altitude rescue.

Passengers, no doubt, will enjoy the comfort, with good outside visibility, low noise and a smooth, fast ride.

Purchase price is from €4 million ($4.4 million) for the fully equipped basic aircraft to €6 million for more specialist configurations, such as law enforcement.

Airbus Defence and Space delivers first A400M to Spain - Airbus,"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0xMS1haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2UtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtYTQwMG0tdG8tc3BhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Aircraft leaves final assembly line at Seville to serve at Zaragoza base

The Spanish Air Force has taken delivery of its first Airbus A400M new generation airlifter – the most advanced aircraft to have been produced in Spain and one which will transform the nation’s air mobility fleet.

Today’s contractual handover of the first of 27 aircraft that it has ordered makes Spain the sixth nation to put the A400M into service.

Representatives of the Spanish Air Force and Ministry of Defence formally accepted the aircraft, known as MSN44, from Airbus Defence and Space in a brief ceremony at the A400M final assembly line (FAL) in Seville.

Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft, Fernando Alonso, said: ""Today is truly a special day for all of us who have been involved with the A400M programme over the years – but particularly for the Seville workforce that has worked so hard to make the aircraft a reality.

""Every delivery to every customer is of huge importance to us, but being able to hand over the first aircraft to Spain from our final assembly line in Seville is a source of particular pride. I would like to thank all our employees, as well as OCCAR and our Spanish customer for achieving this milestone.""

In Spanish service the A400M will replace the ageing C-130 aircraft type, carrying about twice the load over the same distance, or the same load twice as far. In addition it can serve as a tactical air-to-air tanker for other transport aircraft, including other A400Ms.

Uniquely it is able both to cruise at jet-like speeds and altitudes over intercontinental ranges due to its four extremely powerful engines and advanced aerodynamic design, as well as to operate repeatedly from short and unprepared airstrips close to the scene of military action or humanitarian crisis.

Under an agreement signed in September, 14 aircraft will be delivered at a steady pace between now and 2022, and the remaining 13 are scheduled for delivery from 2025 onwards.

The Spanish A400M fleet will be based at Zaragoza in North East Spain and will represent the heavylift element of a transport force that includes the medium C295 and CN235, and light C212 aircraft – all produced by Airbus Defence and Space. MSN44 will fly to Zaragoza in the coming days.

Altogether more than 1600 employees from Airbus Defence and Space work in Spain for the A400m program, including 1100 working directly at the Seville FAL and nearby Tablada Factory. To date eight nations have ordered 174 aircraft of which 34 have now been delivered.

Ultra-broadband laser communications and the geostationary orbit of the relay satellites combine to deliver a secure, near real time data transfer service making strides in data latency.

Thanks to the laser technology developed by Tesat Spacecom, the SpaceDataHighway can transfer high-volume data from Earth observation satellites, airborne platforms, or even from the International Space Station (ISS) at a data rate of 1.8 gbps and can transmit up to 40 terabytes per day. The European Commission’s Earth observation satellites, Copernicus Sentinels, will be the first spacecrafts to benefit from those next generation services.

“The SpaceDataHighway will completely change the way humanitarian crises, maritime safety and the protection of the environment can be managed,” said Evert Dudok, head of the Communications, Intelligence & Security (CIS) business line at Airbus Defence and Space.

The SpaceDataHighway program is a result of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Airbus Defence and Space. The German national aeronautics and space research center (DLR) is also a key sponsor.

EDRS-A, the first relay satellite for the SpaceDataHighway program was launched on Jan. 30. Positioned at 9 degrees east, this first communication node offers coverage from the American East Coast until India. A second satellite will be launched in 2017, which will extend the coverage, capacity and redundancy of the system.

Airbus Defence and Space is willing to expand the SpaceDataHighway with a third node, EDRS-D, to be positioned over the Asia-Pacific region. This third node will be the next step toward global optical fiber in the sky. EDRS-D will have several laser terminals performing optical bidirectional links in order to serve multiple customers, satellites, and aircraft simultaneously. It will also be able to transfer data to another relay satellite, in order to relay data straight back to the other side of the globe while following security standards."

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Restructuring plans at planemaker Airbus <AIR.PA> could result in at least 1,000 job cuts, French union officials said on Wednesday.

The figure includes 780 job cuts, reported earlier by Les Echos, which will be spread between technical research, IT, strategy and legal services, according to Jean-Marc Escourrou, secretary of the Airbus branch of Force Ouvriere union.

Airbus Group in September announced it would merge with its main planemaking unit, in a move aimed at reducing bureaucracy and simplifying its brand.

Details of ""Project Gemini"" are due to be presented to employees in Toulouse on Nov. 29, union officials said.

A European works council meeting scheduled for Dec. 1 will discuss cutbacks in other services such as human resources, finance and purchasing.

""We should exceed 1,000 job reductions,"" Escourrou said.

Airbus declined to comment.

Airbus Helicopters announced separately last month that it would carry out voluntary redundancies covering 582 posts in France between 2017 and 2018 due to a market slowdown.

The maiden flight of Airbus’ A350-1000 – the latest member of the all-new A350 XWB widebody family that is shaping the future of long-haul airline operations – has initiated a fast-paced test and certification programme leading to the jetliner’s service entry next year.During more than 4 hours aloft today, this longest-fuselage version of the A350 XWB demonstrated the performance and efficiency that will be appreciated by airline and aircraft leasing customers worldwide – 11 of which already have ordered 195 A350-1000s from the Middle East, North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.Performing today’s initial in-flight evaluation from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in southwestern France was the aircraft bearing the Manufacturing Serial Number 59 (MSN059) – one of three jetliners that will participate in the A350-1000 flight test and certification campaign.Measuring nearly 74 metres from nose to tail, the A350-1000 is offering a maximum range of 7,950 nautical miles. It is designed for high efficiency, maximum reliability and optimised performance while offering passengers best-in-class comfort with its “Airspace by Airbus” cabin.The A350-1000’s longer fuselage translates to greater capacity, seating 366 passengers (+40 seats compared to the A350-900) in a typical three-class configuration, and answers market needs with a larger premium area to accommodate first class and business class travellers.Further enhancing the A350-1000’s efficiency are its latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 turbofan jet powerplants – the world’s most efficient large aero engines flying today.Deliveries of the A350-1000 are planned to begin in the second half of 2017 with launch customer Qatar Airways (which has ordered 37 aircraft). Other carriers that have booked A350-1000s are United Airlines (with 35 on order), Cathay Pacific (26), Etihad (22) British Airways (18), LATAM (14), Japan Airlines (13), Asiana Airlines (10), Air Lease Corporation (9), Virgin Atlantic (8), and Air Caraïbes (3).The A350-1000 builds on the success of Airbus’ shorter-fuselage A350-900 that entered service in January 2015 and is operated today by nine airlines, which are flying nearly 50 of these jetliners on routes around the globe.Both A350 XWB versions benefit from an all-new fuselage – built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) and sized at a 221-inch cross-section for more personal space and exclusive in-flight experience in all classes of service – and they share an unprecedented level of commonality, with 95 per cent common systems part numbers and the same type rating for pilots.The A350-1000 and A350-900 bring together the very latest in aerodynamics – such as their unique morphing wings designed to reduce drag and lower fuel burn – and advanced technologies for a 25 per cent step change in operating cost compared to its current long-range competitor, underscoring that it is the “Xtra” that makes the difference.For additional information on the A350-1000’s first flight, see the press release"

Estimated reading time 4 minutes, 47 seconds.

HNZ Topflight and Don Wall, president and CEO of HNZ Group, have been awarded Airbus Helicopters Canada’s 2016 Innovation in Safety Award. HNZ Topflight and Wall have been selected for demonstrating an exceptional commitment to safety and passion toward ensuring the next generation of helicopter pilots have access to cutting-edge educational technology that teaches the skills, knowledge and experience required for safe flight operations.

“Safety is and will always be our number one priority. We ensure this by honouring those whose innovations and dedication to safe flying practices propel our industry forward,” said Romain Trapp, president, Airbus Helicopters Canada, and COO, Airbus Helicopters North America. “We are proud to recognize HNZ Topflight and Don Wall for his leadership through the presentation of this award.”

Wall’s vision to provide single engine operators with the same level of synthetic training tools that have been essential to the quality of twin/multi-engine training programs for many years is a testament to his commitment to safety. Convinced of the benefits, Wall spearheaded a tremendous effort to make flight simulator training accessible to single engine visual flight rules (VFR) operators at HNZ Topflight, Canada’s world-renowned advanced flight training school.

Since its origin in 1951, HNZ Topflight, formerly known as the Canadian Helicopters School of Advanced Flight Training, has established a world‐renowned reputation for the caliber of its training programs and has helped shape industry standards in specialized and altitude flying. The techniques developed by HNZ Topflight are known as the gold standard industry wide.

Over the past 60+ years, the school has trained thousands of military, police, corporate and civilian pilots from all over North America and around the world. Clients include the Royal Canadian Air Force, the United States Navy Special Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Royal Danish Air Force.

“We are honoured to accept this award. I am grateful for the support and talents of our team at HNZ Topflight whose hard work and persistence are responsible for making this vision a reality,” said Wall. “Safety is fundamental to everything we do at HNZ and we are strongly committed to developing technologies to improve it.”

The most modern and environmentally friendly long haul aircraft worldwide

The Lufthansa Group will receive its first A350-900, which is the most modern long haul aircraft worldwide and which will be based at Lufthansa’s Munich Hub. The first regular commercial flight will be from Munich to Delhi on 10 February 2017.

“We are looking forward to welcoming our first A350-900 shortly before Christmas.”

And already in February, our passengers will be able to enjoy a higher level of comfort on their flights to Delhi as we have now made further improvements to key components of the A350-900’s cabin interior. This includes a newly designed self-service area in Business Class, new seats with ergonomically designed cushions in Economy Class, larger screens in all classes and improved broadband internet services”, says Thomas Winkelmann, CEO of the Munich Hub.

Once Lufthansa has taken ownership of the aircraft on 19 December, the A350-900 will be transferred to Munich during the week leading up to Christmas. Lufthansa Technik in Munich will then install the cabin interior including the new Premium Economy Class as well as other features so that the new flagship aircraft will be ready to be presented to the public at the beginning of February.

From February 2017 onwards, Lufthansa will station the first ten Airbus A350-900 aircraft in Munich. The first flight destinations are Delhi and Boston. The aircraft will have space for 293 passengers – 48 in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in the regular Economy Class section.

The A350-900 is the most modern and environmentally friendly long haul aircraft worldwide and uses 25 percent less kerosene and produces 25 percent fewer emissions. The A350-900’s noise “footprint” is up to 50 percent lower than that of comparable aircraft types."
How Peachy! Peach signs for 13 Airbus A320 family aircraft - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNi8xMS8xOC9wZWFjaHktcGVhY2gtc2lnbnMtMTMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtZmFtaWx5LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Low Cost Carrier Peach Aviation has signed for 13 new Airbus A320 family aircraft.



Peach Aviation Airbus A320neo – Rendering, Airbus

The Japanese carrier has signed for 10 Airbus A320neo and three A320ceo aircraft from the manufacturer as part of its plans to expand its network.

With this agreement, Peach Aviation becomes the first low-cost carrier of the Airbus A320neo in Japan.

The A320ceo aircraft will be delivered during 2018, whilst the A320neo aircraft will be delivered from 2019.

Peach currently configure their A320ceo aircraft with 180 seats. The A320neos will gain an extra 8 seats, taking the count to 188 seats.

The airline currently has its primary base in Kansai International, with additional hubs at Naha in Okinawa and at Tokyo Nartia. It competes with Vanilla Air, Jetstar Japan, Skymark, AirDO, Starflyer, Spring Airlines Japan and Air Asia Japan – as well as the traditional carriers of All Nippon Airways and Japan Air Lines.

With these new aircraft, Peach intends to open up a base at Sendai in 2017, and at New Chitose Airport in Sapporo in 2018.

For Airbus, it’s another small and important win. Until a few years ago, airlines in Japan were solid Boeing stronghold. But as low-cost carriers demand more competition and more options, Airbus has slowly snuck in to provision aircraft for carriers.

And we all know competition is a good thing.

Fly Qatar's All-Business Airbus A319 From Doha to Dubai - The Points Guy,"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzExL2FsbC1idXNpbmVzcy1hMzE5LWRvaGEtdG8tZHViYWkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the Farnborough Air Show this summer, I had a chance to check out two pretty slick Qatar Airways private jets: a Gulfstream G650 and an Airbus A319, with just 40 seats in an all-business 2-2 configuration. Generally, you'll need to have a very wealthy friend (or have some deep pockets yourself) to get a chance to fly this A319, but for a limited time Qatar is operating that aircraft on scheduled service between Doha and Dubai. It's even possible to redeem miles to get on board!

Interestingly, this news comes the same week Emirates announced that it'll fly an A380 between the two cities, but it seems unlikely that Qatar is launching this higher-end service in response to its competitor's surprising move. The A319 has already begun flying between DOH and DXB, and it's scheduled to remain on the route through January 21, 2017.

You won't have much time for a snooze on this DOH-DXB flight.

Since Qatar Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance, you can redeem partner miles for a one-way or round-trip flight. You'll need 40,000 miles each way if you're redeeming from AA's AAdvantage program, but British Airways members can book the flight for just 18,000 Avios (+$36 in taxes and fees).

That's still a significant amount for a ~40-minute flight, but considering you'll need to pay roughly $750 for a one-way revenue ticket, that's a heck of a deal. Note that Qatar is marketing the business-class cabin as first class on this flight, so you should have access to the Al Safwa first-class lounge in Doha.

Will you be going out of your way to fly Qatar's all-business A319?

The aircraft is the manufacturer’s largest twin-engined airliner ever, and can accommodate 40 more passengers than the existing A350-900.

The new variant also features “a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines”.

The first flight took off from Blagnac, Toulouse at 1042 local time, with six crew including three in the cockpit, and a further three monitoring test parameters at the flight-test-instrumentation station behind the cockpit.

Airbus said it had benefitted from the experience of the A350-900 test campaign, resulting in a shorter development programme for the A350-1000.

Qatar Airways is the launch customer for the aircraft– a total of 11 customers have placed orders for 195 A350-1000s.

A Success: Airbus' First A350-1000 Completes Its Maiden Flight in Toulouse - AirlineGeeks.com,"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzExLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Planes ] By Thomas Gilpin

Airbus reached a key goal in the development of the A350-1000 after a successful maiden flight was made from Toulouse-Blagnac airport today. The initial flight was scheduled to take place at approximately 10:30 a.m. local time and, after waiting briefly at a holding position, the aircraft took-off at 10:42 a.m. from Runway 32L, shadowed closely by a Dassault Falcon 20 chase plane. The aircraft then turned onto a southbound heading of 190, climbing to 10000 feet, to start its initial flight testing.

This was followed by a test flight lasting four hours over southwest France. In the cockpit were experimental test pilots Hughes Van Der Stitchel and Frank Chapman, along with Test Flight Engineer Gerard Maisonneuve. For approximately 3 hours, they flew at 10,000 feet and kept to around 250 knots, then tested some higher speeds and climbed to 25,000 feet, before returning to 10,000 feet and back to Toulouse-Blagnac.

During the flight, Christophe Cail, the Airbus Chief Test Pilot said, “The first flight is going very well, it took off around three hours ago. It climbed to 10,000 feet and is still at that level, exploring the flight envelope of the aircraft from low speed, high speed, all the flap configuration. And so far, so good; everything is working well.”

With a stretched version of the A350-900 fuselage, the A350-1000 is the longest in the A350XWB family, and the largest twin-engine aircraft made by Airbus. Previously, the company had plans for a smaller A350-800, but these were canceled due to the A330neo development.

Notable external appearance differences of the A350-1000 to the A350-900 include the 74-meter fuselage, making it seven meters longer, and the switch from four wheels to six wheel bogies for the main undercarriage. There are also key differences in the overall operational performances.

Among these differences are a longer range of 7950 nautical miles, a standard layout allowing for 366 passengers (including 18-inch seats in economy), and a 25% lower operating cost compared to various competitors.

The aircraft is powered by a higher-thrust version of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, producing 97000 lbs of takeoff thrust, and is designed for high efficiency, maximum reliability, and optimized performance.

Viewed as a replacement for the A340 and possibly the A330 family, the A350 already has regulatory approval for a common type rating between the two aircraft. The first A350 aircraft to take to the skies was the A350-900, on 14th June 2013, with type certification given just over a year later in September 2014. With the introduction of the A350-1000, the aircraft is now in direct competition with the Boeing 777.

Published figures from Airbus currently show that 195 aircraft are on order, spread between 11 operators from five continents, with the first planned delivery to Qatar Airways in the second half of 2017.

With the success of this fight, further testing can now begin in earnest. Due to experience with the A350-900, this is expected to take only around a year with a three aircraft test fleet.

Commenting on these test aircraft, Christophe Cail added, “The first one was MSN059 and this model is equipped with a heavy flight test installation. There is no cabin in the back, so on this aircraft we have indicated to open the flight envelope, to test braking systems, to test the engines, to do lot a lot of tests on the aircraft. We have a second one with a heavy flight test installation, MSN071. This one will fly in the coming weeks and will help the first aircraft just to continue tests on the wire system. And there will be a third one, MSN065, and this one, unlike the others, will be fitted with a cabin. It will mainly test the air conditioning the cabin, the pressurization of the aircraft.”

After the completion of the flight, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier said, “We have seen today the world’s most modern and efficient passenger aircraft – the A350-1000 – in action for the very first time, adding soon to the successful A350 Family. My congratulations and thanks go to all the teams who have contributed to make today’s flight happen.”

Emirates airline says Rolls-Royce's Airbus A380 engines not up to standard - The National,"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlybGluZS1zYXlzLXJvbGxzLXJveWNlcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1lbmdpbmVzLW5vdC11cC10by1zdGFuZGFyZC0xLjIyNDIzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates, the world’s biggest long-haul airline, said it’s unhappy with performance shortfalls afflicting US$6.1 billion’s worth of Rolls-Royce engines ordered to power a batch of 50 Airbus A380 superjumbos.

Feedback on the Trent 900 powerplants indicates “technical issues” that need to be resolved before the first plane is delivered to Emirates next month, Tim Clark, the Dubai-carrier’s president, said on Friday in Frankfurt.

“We have a new engine coming on and there are some issues with that at the moment,” Mr Clark said at a media briefing. “We want the engines as promised in the contract.”

Emirates last year ordered 217 Trent 900s - sufficient to power the 50 four-engine A380s, plus spares - after previously purchasing GP7000 powerplants from an alliance of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for its first 90 superjumbos. The deal with Rolls included unspecified “quality improvements”.

Mr Clark said Emirates will “hopefully” still take the first Rolls-Royce powered plane on December 2 as planned, adding that talks are under way with the manufacturer on resolving the performance problems and whether it should compensate the airline.

London-based Rolls-Royce said in an email that it is “working with Emirates and Airbus to meet the planned entry into service of the Trent-powered A380 within the Emirates fleet”.

Mr Clark said that officially deferring delivery of the planes isn’t an option since doing so would impact the model’s entire supply chain. Emirates is due to take 25 Rolls-powered A380s between now and 2019, plus 25 more from 2021 on.

While the Trent 900 had its first test flight in 2004 and has a greater spread of A380 operators than the GE-Pratt model, it had previously been excluded from the world’s largest superjumbo fleet. Emirates switched supplier on the understanding that Rolls would help develop an upgraded and re-engined “Neo” version to help pare operating costs and extend the model’s lifespan.

A lack of interest in buying more double-deckers among other carriers has effectively killed off that plan, and Airbus is now planning to slow production to just one plane per month in 2018 to eke out the backlog and keep its options open in case demand revives.

Emirates took delivery of its 85th A380 this month and operates almost 250 aircraft in total, all of them either superjumbos or Boeing 777s.

Aircalin inks first Airbus A330neo order in Oceania market - Airline Ratings,"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmNhbGluLWlua3MtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBuZW8tb3JkZXItaW4tb2NlYW5pYS1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The toe-to-toe battle for aircraft sales in the Pacific region continues with Airbus registering a win on Tuesday with a maiden A330neo deal in the Oceania market.

New Caledonian carrier Aircalin signed an agreement for two A320neos and two A330-900 aircraft at a ceremony in the French territory but has yet to reveal details about engines or cabin configuration.

The narrow bodies will be deployed on existing regional routes such as Australia and New Zealand, while the A330neos will boost services to Japan as well as potentially open new routes to destinations such as China.

Airbus touts the A330neo as the most cost-efficient aircraft in its size category, offering a 14 per cent reduction in fuel burn, a longer non-stop flying range of up to 4000 nautical miles and the lowest maintenance costs of any aircraft.

It hopes other airlines will take note of the Aircalin decision.

“They may only be a small airline but I think they’re well known for being very well run, very dependable and all of that,’’ Airbus executive vice president Europe, Africa and the Pacific Christopher Buckley told AirlineRatings from Noumea. “Hopefully it will lead to a few other A330neos elsewhere … so it’s an important one for us.’’

Although not the biggest of markets, Oceania — which includes Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands — is still forecast to require more than 1000 new aircraft over the next 20 years worth $US160 billion. Passenger traffic in the region is expected to grow at a respectable clip of 4.7 per cent per year.

Both major manufacturers are counting coup wherever they can and Buckley conceded competition was tough.

Boeing announced last week that Fiji Airways had inked a deal to replace five Boeing 737s with five B737 MAX’s to be used on the carrier’s short- and medium- haul network to destinations such as Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. The first two of the five brand new B737 MAX 8 aircraft will arrive in 2018 with the others coming a year later.

Fiji Airways chief executive Andre Viljoen said the decision had been made after “an extremely exhaustive procurement and selection process’’ that highlighted improved operating economics and product enhancements as compelling reasons for the decision.

It was a similar story at Aircalin on Tuesday as chief executive Didier Tappero outlined the reasons for sticking with Airbus.

“As part of our plan to boost tourism to New Caledonia, Aircalin has made a strategic decision to renew its complete fleet with the A320neo and the A330neo to grow routes and connect New Caledonia to the region,” Tappero said. “The neo aircraft, with its state-of-the-art technology, will burn less fuel, lower our operational costs and offer our loyal passengers the highest standards in cabin comfort.”

Buckley argues his US rival is competing even more aggressively because it needed to fill 737 MAX production slots as it continues to ramp up the rate at its Seattle factory. But he said Airbus was still ahead.

He cited one Airbus advantage as the flexibility provided by the bigger A321neo, a plane taken by Air New Zealand and which gives the A320 family a variety of ranges and capacities. He also believed the A320 family was best for the passengers and had superior economics.

“We never underestimate the competition out there,’’ he said. “We just have to make sure the airlines understand exactly what our aircraft can do. ‘’

One sale Airbus is keen to make in Oceania was highlighted on Friday when latest version of Airbus A350, the bigger A350-1000, took to the air on its first test flight.

The A350-900 is already in service and Buckley said the manufacturer was pleased with the way it was travelling, despite some “little niggles’’.

“It wouldn’t be any secret to say we’d certainly love to see some 350s in this part of the world,’’ he said, noting there were long-term opportunities for he aircraft as Boeing 777 replacement at Air New Zealand and as a Boeing 747 replacement at Qantas.

Airbus is particularly interested in Qantas plans for ultra long-haul routes to destinations such as Europe and is introducing a ULR version of the A350-900 for Singapore Airlines.

“We’d be extremely interested in trying to make something work at Qantas with future derivatives, what we might call an ultra-long range version of the 350-900s and potentially the -1000 as well,’’ he said, noting that the question was what Airbus could offer in the gap between its A380 superjumbo and the Boeing 787-9.

“So in the long term, and I think it is quite the long term, there is a window of opportunity.’’"
ANALYSIS: How Airbus Helicopters has kept its 20-year-old H135 looking young - Flightglobal,"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2FuYWx5c2lzLWhvdy1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtaGFzLWtlcHQtaXRzLTIwLXllYXItb2xkLWgxMzUtbG9va2luZy15b3VuZy8xMjIyMzkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a period where the market for heavy rotorcraft has dried up, much of the good news for Airbus Helicopters is coming from its German factory and is being generated by the pair of twin-engined, medium-class platforms it produces there, the H135 and H145.

According to its third-quarter sales figures, between them the two aircraft accounted for 211 of total net orders, registering respective figures of 42 and 47 for the nine months ended 30 September.

For the H135, which celebrated its 20th anniversary earlier this year, the feat is particularly impressive given that it is a product originally conceived in the 1970s, predating the formation of Eurocopter.

Air inlet cowlings have been relocated in order to cut installation losses from the engines

Airbus Helicopters

Of course, the 2.9t maximum take-off weight helicopter has gone through multiple iterations since the first delivery to launch operator DRF Luftrettung in 1996.

The latest, the P3/T3 – the letters denote either Pratt & Whitney or Turbomeca (now Safran Helicopter Engines) powerplants – arrived in late 2014 and saw the addition of a number of enhancements to improve hot and high performance.

Replacing the previous P2/T2 models, the new variant features longer main rotor blades, relocated engine inlets – designed to reduce installation power losses – and uprated powerplants.

In October 2015 the manufacturer announced that it would bring a further upgrade to the type with the addition of the Helionix avionics system which is used on the H145 and super-medium H175.

All this chopping and changing has caused a problem, however: from next year, when the first Helionix-equipped example is delivered, three distinct versions of the H135 will be produced at its Donauwörth factory. These will comprise the P3/T3 models both with and without Helionix, plus a lingering tail of P2/T2s, the latter representing about 10% of the total backlog.

This, says programme manager Axel Humpert, is less than efficient: “It is one of my concerns because it is not providing me the cost benefits with my production because I have to service several variants,” he says.

The strategy from mid-2018 is to build only Helionix-enabled P3/T3 helicopters and phase out the older variant. Negotiations are ongoing with customers for helicopters fitted with the current-generation cockpit and the P2/T2 over switching to the latest variant, but Humpert concedes that some will stick to their guns, simply for reasons of fleet commonality.

In that situation – with deliveries contracted until 2019 – the rotorcraft will be assembled earlier and then parked to enable the production cut-off in 2018.

“I want to finish with the current glass cockpit in 2018 to stabilise my production on one type only,” Humpert says. To encourage this migration, prices on the current glass cockpit will rise “for product policy reasons”, with 2017 the final year in which to order it.

As well as new-build helicopters, an enhancement package is available to raise the in-service examples of the previous version to the P3/T3 standard.

Humpert says there are “lots of upgrade prospects”, with 145 offers out to the market. It is mainly driven by improvements to the FADEC software, but the repositioning of the air inlet cowlings – moving them to the side rather than the front of the aircraft – is a “major driver to improve available power” through a “significant reduction” in engine installation losses.

Previously, air had to bypass lots of equipment on the way to the aft engine deck, causing pressure loss and a temperature increase of about 3°C (5.4°F), translating to a reduction in the engine power available, particularly at altitude or in hot conditions.

In addition, the rotor diameter grows to 10.4m (34ft) from 10.2m previously, combining with the other changes to significantly lift hot and high performance.

The longer blades have another benefit too: because there is less rotor loading, noise emissions are cut to 8.4dB below ICAO limits, making the H135 one of the quietest in its class. “Customer feedback is that the helicopter is much less noisy,” says Humpert.

Backlog for the type stands at about 80 units, and “as the market is coming back again” the production rate is rising from 36 aircraft last year to 48 in 2016 and to 64 next year. “So this is one of the big challenges I am going through to manage the production ramp-up,” says Humpert. He is hopeful sales momentum can be maintained so that output can be held at the 2017 rate.

Since the programme started, the airframer has delivered a little over 1,220 examples of the helicopter to 350 customers in 75 countries.

Half of the operational fleet is engaged in emergency medical services (EMS) operations, 17% in business and commercial transport, 16% in public services (typically law enforcement), 10% in military missions, 4% in offshore operations (typically wind farm inspections), and the remaining 3% in military training.

Humpert is confident that the latter market is an area ripe for growth. Australia, Germany and Japan are all customers for H135 trainers, with the UK added to that list earlier in the year following its selection of the type for the country’s Military Flight Training System requirement.

Twenty-nine examples, powered by Safran Arrius 2B2+ turboshafts, will be supplied under the contract, with deliveries to begin in 2017. A bigger opportunity will also present itself next year when the US Navy begins an effort to replace its current fleet of Bell Helicopter TH-57 Sea Ranger trainers, which Airbus Helicopters anticipates responding to with the lighter, single-engined H125 and/or the H135.

It is a trend that Humpert thinks will continue as militaries shift away from training on light single-engined helicopters.

“More and more armies are training their pilots on light, entry-level twins as it is more economically efficient to prepare them for [front-line] missions on heavy twins. It seems to pay off for them,” he says.

China also presents a significant opportunity for the H135. Earlier this year Airbus Helicopters and its local partner, Sino-German Ecopark, formalised an agreement that will see the creation of a final assembly line for the type in Qingdao. In addition, it has secured orders from a consortium of local operators covering the first 100 helicopters to be produced at the new facility.

“The opening of the skies in China opens the opportunity for any manufacturer or operator to bring their aircraft into China. We believe [the new facility] will bring us into the front line for Chinese-assembled helicopters,” Humpert says.

Construction work on the new site will begin in 2017, with Chinese engineers and technicians training in Donauwörth in 2017 and 2018 on the first five helicopters. Production will begin at the Qingdao plant in 2018, initially with a mixture of Airbus Helicopters and local staff, with the aim of delivering the first rotorcraft built there from 2019. “And once production is stabilised, then we will leave it to the Chinese,” he adds.

The current contract is for 100 helicopters “but if it is only that it will not pay off” as an investment, Humpert says. Its production target from 2019-20 is 15 a year, “but we count that we will attract more customers by then”.

He adds: “It will be profitable once we have passed the 23-helicopter threshold.”

Airbus Helicopters’ strategy has seen the position of the H135 reinforced by the decision last year to ditch the AS355 Twin Squirrel – effectively a French-built competitor, at a similar price point to the German model but “less capable” – says Humpert.

“It has had experienced its good times; that is why we are replacing the twin-engined product policy with only the H135.

“Our strategy is to have this helicopter as a light-twin, low-cost entry model. That is why we have done significant work to reduce the costs on the H135.”

As well as holding the list price for the past three years – “we offer more helicopter for the same money” as Humpert puts it – work has been done to significantly reduce the H135’s direct maintenance costs.

These have come down by about 15% so far and Humpert believes “there is more in the pipe” to enable a 20% reduction over 2013 costs.

In addition, life limits have been removed on main rotor blades, and gearbox time-before-overhaul rates have risen to 3,600h. They will jump again to 4,000h next year and to 5,000h in 2018-19, assuming operational trials go to plan.

Of course, the H135 does not have the market to itself, with both the AgustaWestland AW109 and Bell 429 competing in the segment. In addition, there are signs that the Italian manufacturer is contemplating a successor to its current light twin, tentatively referred to as the AW209.

Humpert suggests that the arrival of a new contender in the market would be the obvious “trigger on our side to launch [a further upgrade]” but points to the 20 years of cost and reliability advantages that are currently in its favour.

“That is why do not fear [our competitors]. We are dominating the market with the H135. Even if the AW209 comes I believe it will be something more like the 429: heavier, more fuel consumption, less range, higher cost.”

Significantly, Airbus Helicopters has been maturing a basket of aerodynamic and technical improvements under its Bluecopter initiative. Although the manufacturer is at pains to point out these are largely platform agnostic and could be applied to any helicopter in its range, they have been demonstrated on one of the original EC135 prototypes.

Although Humpert acknowledges that technologies matured on the Bluecopter will find a place on the H135 in future, they will be applied only as part of an upgrade programme. “Once we are forced to do a step, it will be a step where we expect more than a small aerodynamic improvement,” he says.

And mitigating against any further near-term changes is that “customers would like to see a stabilisation of the production line or product line”. In other words, constant upgrades and an ever-growing number of variants make it much harder to maintain fleet commonality. “They would like us to maintain [one] configuration for a number of years.”

Speaking at the beginning of October at an event to mark the type’s 20th anniversary, Airbus Helicopters chief executive Guillaume Faury described the H135 as “a great success”, noting that it “represents very well the DNA of Airbus Helicopters”.

“Twenty years makes it sound like a very old aircraft but in reality it is very young,” he said.

Humpert is firmly behind this statement: “Twenty years is not a lot for a helicopter – past models were in production for a lot longer. It is still within the first half of its life – clearly there is a lot to come in future.”

Meet THOR—a Lightweight Mini-Plane Fresh out of the 3D Printer - Futurism,"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1wcmVzZW50cy10aG9yLWEtbWluaS1wbGFuZS1mcmVzaC1mcm9tLXRoZS0zZC1wcmludGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Printable Aircraft

Airbus, a leading aircraft manufacturer, has just unleashed THOR—Test of High-tech Objectives in Reality—a miniature aircraft constructed from 3D printing technology. The windowless, pilotless, and propeller-driven THOR weighs in at 21 kg, and measures less than 4 m long.

Though it is much smaller than a regular jet, THOR is capable of stable flight and even promises to save on time, fuel and money.

The majority of THOR's parts are extruded out of a 3D printer from a substance called polyamide. The only parts of the plane that aren't printed are its electrical elements.

The use of 3D printing technology in the field of aviation presents many benefits. Jens Henzler of the Hofmann Innovation Group, a leading supplier of automotive plastic components, says, ""The printed pieces have the advantage of requiring no tools and…they can be made very quickly.""

Aside from the speedy production of parts, the metal components created from 3D printing technology are lighter than traditionally-manufactured parts by 30-50%. 3D-printed components also eliminate manufacturing waste and cut manufacturing costs.

Engineers also have plans to apply this technology to spacecraft. In fact, the European Space Agency (ESA) plans to begin using the Airbus Ariane 6 rocket in 2020, which will feature many printed components and potentially halve the costs incurred by its predecessor, the Ariane 5.

Aviation Innovation

The latest 3D printers are capable of printing longer and more complex designs. Airbus is exploring this by testing methods enabling them to print an injection assembly for an engine, reducing the number of individual pieces from 270 to just three.

And because 3D-printed aircraft are lighter, they require less fuel, reducing carbon emissions and other pollutants from being released into the environment. As air traffic is expected to double in the next 20 years, reducing the carbon footprint in aviation is a priority. Ralf Fuecks—head of the Heinrich Boell foundation think tank of the German Green Party—says, ""the decisive issue is radical technical innovation in a relatively short time.""

He may have a point. A survey of air industry insiders reveals that many believe that, by 2030, most spare aircraft parts will be printed on site at the airport, and that even the aircraft themselves will be entirely 3D-printed."

Singapore’s fleet of H225M will be used for a wide spectrum of operations including search-and-rescue, aeromedical evacuation, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. A proven platform with exceptional payload, a world-class automatic flight control system and long endurance, the H225M has demonstrated its versatility and performance even in the harshest operational environments.

The H225M is the latest evolution of the successful Super Puma/Cougar family of military helicopters, with more than 500 units delivered worldwide. Singapore is the latest nation to order the H225M, after France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Kuwait."
Debut of largest Airbus A350 signals triumph of two-engined jets | Mint - Mint,"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9JbmR1c3RyeS9CWDhYakJLbmg2VHhkZVdwMEFtcmNQL0RlYnV0LW9mLWxhcmdlc3QtQWlyYnVzLUEzNTAtc2lnbmFscy10cml1bXBoLW9mLXR3b2VuZ2luZWQuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vSW5kdXN0cnkvQlg4WGpCS25oNlR4ZGVXcDBBbXJjUC9EZWJ1dC1vZi1sYXJnZXN0LUFpcmJ1cy1BMzUwLXNpZ25hbHMtdHJpdW1waC1vZi10d29lbmdpbmVkLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/London: The biggest version of Airbus Group SE’s A350 wide-body jet made its first flight on Thursday, swelling the twin-engine model’s capacity and casting further doubt on the future of four-turbine planes including the Boeing Co. 747 and the European manufacturer’s own A380.

The A350-1000, which departed Airbus’s base in Toulouse, France, at 10:42am local time, seats 366 people in three classes. That’s just 44 fewer than the latest version of the 747, and with a vastly improved fuel burn thanks to the new aircraft’s two engines and composite construction.

So-called twinjet planes have become the mainstay of inter-continental travel, with the A350, the baseline version of which had its first commercial flight in 2015, following on from the slightly smaller Boeing 787. Both models have built on inroads made by the US company’s 777, which began eating into markets previously restricted to four-jet models fully two decades ago and seats 364 people in three classes with No. 1 operator Emirates of Dubai.

Before the advent of the so-called “big twin"" aircraft, older two-engine wide-bodies such as the 767 and A330 were limited to medium-haul markets such as the north Atlantic, partly because of practical limits on how far they could fly in the event of one turbine failing. The 777 cast off those shackles by winning certification for flights as far as three hours from the nearest airport.

The standard A350-900 has US Federal Aviation Administration approval for up to five hours or 2,000 nautical miles of diversionary flying on a single engine, making possible trips from Southeast Asia and Australia to the US. In a denser configuration the new -1000 will be able to carry 440 people, less than 100 short of the A380 superjumbo’s standard 525-passenger payload, though the double-decker could accommodate as many as 800 seats in a single class.

The airline industry’s appetite for bigger twin-engine planes was revealed when Airbus scrapped a shrunken A350-800 variant, which was deemed too small at 280 seats, and opted instead to upgrade the A330 for shorter routes.

Bigger Boeings

Boeing is also adding more seats to its 777, with new slimline berths taking the total on the long-range 777-300ER to 396 while still retaining three classes.

Twinjet capacity will increase still further with the 777X upgrade of the best-selling wide-body from 2020, the largest of which will seat as many as 425 people in three classes, with a bigger version under consideration able to take upwards of 450 travelers, making it a true jumbo in its own right.

All told, the A350, 787 and 777 have unfilled orders totaling more than 1,950 planes, versus just 29 for the 747 and 121 for the A380. The Airbus A340, which emerged around the time of the 777, has already ceased production, though the lower oil price is prolonging its active life with some carriers.

The A350-1000’s debut flight means Airbus has met its goal of getting the model into the air before the end of 2016, with Qatar Airways Ltd. scheduled to be the first carrier to deploy the aircraft next year. The manufacturer is still racing to deliver the 50 A350-900s promised this year amid delays in the supply of interior fittings from suppliers including Paris-based Safran SA.

Airbus’s next challenge may be to decide whether to develop a further stretch of the A350 to combat the revamped 777.

That option is emerging as more attractive than upgrading the A380, which appears to have few enthusiasts beyond Emirates, while the A350-1000 has attracted only 196 orders, versus about 600 for the baseline version, suggesting customers may be holding out for a bigger model. Bloomberg

Deliveries of H135 with the Helionix cockpit system are scheduled by next year, with helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) operator Norsk Luftambulanse being the first commercial operator of the variant.

The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) will be the first military customer to use the H135 helicopters equipped with Helionix system.

Airbus Helicopters H135 programme head Axel Humpert said: “The certification of the H135 with Helionix marks another milestone in the permanent evolution of this helicopter.



“The certification of the H135 with Helionix marks another milestone in the permanent evolution of this helicopter.""

“The Helionix cockpit system with four-axis autopilot significantly reduces the workload of the pilot and brings the H135 to an unrivalled level of safety due to the additional functions and mission features it adds to the H135’s capability.”

Capable of conducting four-axis autopilot operation, Helionix features three electronic displays, night-vision goggle (NVG) compatible cockpit and a first limit indicator, which provides proper engine instrument data for the pilot in one indicator.

Two touchscreen GPS/Nav/Comm GTN-750 systems are also included in Helionix in order to ensure an all-in-one GPS navigation and communication system.

The TAS620A traffic advisory system featured in Helionix improves flight safety by assisting pilots in detecting and avoiding aircraft intersecting their flight path.

Airbus Helicopters has so far delivered nearly 1,200 H135s to customers worldwide.

The Airbus restructuring will conclude the company’s moving of its headquarters from Paris and Munich to Toulouse in southern France

European aircraft-maker Airbus is to cut a net total of 934 jobs as part of a previously announced restructuring aimed at stripping out bureaucracy and simplifying its brand.

Airbus Group said it would be cutting 1,164 jobs while also creating around 230 positions in other areas – confirming details released earlier by a French trade union. The company added it was in “constructive” talks with union partners. Unions had previously expressed fears about job cuts after Airbus outlined plans in September for an internal merger with its aircraft-making arm.

The restructuring is part of a plan to allow Airbus to move away from its complex corporate roots as it prepares for tougher expected competition.

Airbus added on Tuesday that the restructuring would also conclude the company’s moving of its headquarters from Paris and Munich to Toulouse in southern France.

'Ghost' Airbus A350 sighting unnerves aviation industry - The National,"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2hvc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtc2lnaHRpbmctdW5uZXJ2ZXMtYXZpYXRpb24taW5kdXN0cnktMS4xODk3MTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus presented dignitaries and media assembled for the debut of its latest model with an unexpected sight recently: a white-painted US$300-million A350 jetliner being prepared for delivery without an airline livery, breaking an industry taboo.

So-called white-tails are considered an alarm signal in the aerospace industry because they usually signify that they have been built without an airline in place to operate them, although in rare cases buyers can decide to paint them elsewhere.

Because of past downturns, plane makers have learned to build only what they have sold so nowadays the sight of a white plane, also known as a “ghost”, especially a recent model such as the A350, is extremely rare.

In this case, the aircraft has been sold to one of the world’s largest leasing companies, AerCap, according to online records of the serial number on the tail.

AerCap had arranged to lease it to SriLankan Airlines but its fate was thrown into doubt when the carrier said this year it had cancelled a lease for four A350s from AerCap and no longer intended to buy a further four from Airbus due to steep losses.

The Dublin-based lessor is unlikely to be out of pocket since the Sri Lankan government said last month it would pay millions of dollars for cancelling the lease.

The chief executive of Airbus’ commercial jet division said he had grown more confident of reaching this year’s target of at least 50 A350-900 deliveries.

“The objective has not changed. I visited the final assembly line last Tuesday and they are still working on 50 this year,” Fabrice Brégier said at an event marking the maiden flight of the larger A350-1000.

“I am more confident than I was at the end of June,” he said, adding: “We are now really in the ramp-up phase so we target 50 aircraft this year, or very close to it.”

But industry sources said the flexible white design raised questions about where the aircraft was headed next, which in turn echoed deeper concerns about a drop in demand for big jets.

Some online reports, however, said the jet is headed for China.

A spokeswoman for AerCap declined to comment.

The unconfirmed fate of the former SriLankan jet is a reminder of the struggles some carriers face amid fierce competition.

Its appearance in white just yards from a high-profile company ceremony was apparently an accident of scheduling in the busy Airbus delivery centre, which pumps out two planes a day.

But it struck a jarring note in an otherwise upbeat event to mark the first flight of the latest A350-1000 model, betraying a flaw in the rigid on-message flavour of such ceremonies, and intruding on the celebration like a ghost of past recessions.

“It is hard to see how that is a comforting omen,” an aviation industry source said, asking not to be named.

Without confirming whether the aircraft was destined for AerCap, an Airbus spokesman said: “We do not comment on our customers’ customers [and] we always deliver our aircraft to the customer’s specifications.”

Airbus, Boeing and many lessors say that although demand for large jets has slipped recently, the longer-term prospects for long-haul travel are robust and that jets like the A350, one of the newest types available, rarely stay unused for long.

Dubbed ""Delta Premium"" the new service will arrive in 2017 with the airline's new Airbus A350 fleet.

This announcement came just a month after American Airlines' new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner entered service equipped with its own brand new premium economy cabin.

So what's the big deal about premium economy seats?

After all, international airlines such as Taiwan's EVA Air and Britain's Virgin Atlantic have had them since the early 1990s.

The big deal is that American's and Delta's investment in this new product shows how much these airlines have changed over the past decade.

Here's what I mean.

In the ""good old days"" of commercial aviation, booking a flight on America's airlines meant you had a choice between first class, business, and coach. They were the three options we've always had and for the most part we, as consumers, seemed to be pretty happy with it.

Fast forward to the early 2000s.

Fall out from 9/11 followed by the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression decimated America's legacy airlines. Several rounds of bankruptcies and mergers ensued with three mega airlines emerging from the fray.

However, the American, Delta, and United Airlines that we know today are not the same old dinosaurs that their legacy branding would lead you to believe.

The days of frivolous spending, unchecked capacity expansion, and an almost blinding naivety to the changing needs of the modern consumer are gone.

The companies that emerged are leaner and more financially prudent. These days, American, Delta, and United all operate with double digit profit margins — something virtually unheard of for full-service international airlines.

But even more important is the fact that they've become more keen to the detailed needs of their clientele. In fact, some would say that America's major airlines have have, in recent years, turned understanding what flyers can live with and without into a true science.

Story continues

""We are constantly trying to get a better understanding of what our customers want,"" Delta's managing director for product and customer experience Joe Kiely told Business Insider in an interview regarding the creation of Delta Premium.

""We have 180 million passengers that fly on our planes every year, so we have many opportunities to learn.""

What Delta learned led to a much greater level of product segmentation — with the latest progeny of that decision being a full on international premium economy product.

""We discovered that there's pent up demand for a product that slots in between our Delta One and our economy cabins,"" Kiely added.

According Kiely, Delta's customers wanted comfort, space to be productive, and connectivity without the cost of a premium suite like Delta One.

Although some may see product segmentation as a way to nickel and dime the consumer, an argument can be made that it allows airlines to better key in on the needs and wants of the individual.

For example, Delta now offers bargain hunters a low-cost offering called Basic Economy which does not allow customers to pre-select seats and make changes to their itinerary. One rung above that is their Main Cabin product, which offers the traditionalist an run-of-the-mill economy class experience. At the same time, Delta also offers an Comfort Plus product which — for a small fee — gives economy passengers a slightly nicer flight, but at the a much lower price point than business class.

Delta One

Slotting above Comfort Plus is the new Delta Premium offering, which is targeted at business and leisure travelers who want a premium experience, but aren't willing to pay for Delta One's luxury suites at the top of the the range.

Are America's airline's perfect? No. Far from it. There is certainly room for improvement in terms of customer service, seat comfort, and many other aspects. However, their decision to segment their product offerings allows customers the ability to pay for the experiences and the services of their choosing. That is certainly a step in the right direction.

And Premium Economy is a great example of that.

This makes Emirates the first and only airline in the world to operate a fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft for its passenger flights.

[su_youtube_advanced url=”http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCGJo1-1fgc” rel=”no”]

Emirates recently retired A6-EAK from operational service. The aircraft was the last of the 29 Airbus A330 aircraft that had been operating as part of its fleet. A6-EAK joined Emirates in 2002 and had flown for over 60,000 hours travelling close to 45 million kilometres in 14.5 years. That distance is equivalent to almost 60 return journeys between the Earth and the Moon. Emirates has also phased out A6-ERN, the last serving Airbus A340 in the fleet which had joined the airline in 2004, originally manufactured in 1999.

Since January 2015, Emirates has retired 18 A330 and 5 A340 aircraft from its fleet. The average age of the Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft phased out from the fleet is 16.5 years- a figure which is well below the industry standard retirement age of 25 years. In addition to the aircraft that have been retired from active service since January 2015, Emirates plans to further phase out some 25 aircraft over the course of 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the operating fleet remains modern and efficient while offering customers a higher level of comfort and safety.

The retirement of older aircraft is balanced by the induction of younger, more modern aircraft into the fleet. This has resulted in Emirates operating one of the youngest fleets in the industry with an average age of 5.2 years. The two youngest aircraft in the fleet- Emirates’ 85th A380- the first of the new generation A380 aircraft delivered in October 2016 and Emirates’ 125th Boeing 777-300ER- are less than 2 weeks old. Emirates’ fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft will also have a smaller environmental impact as both aircraft types have better fuel efficiency and emissions performance than the retired aircraft.

For the calendar year 2016 Emirates will have taken delivery of 36 new aircraft – 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777. This also includes the next generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft – with upgraded business class seats and other features including a lower fuel burn ratio – to be delivered from November 2016.

Emirates is currently the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet. Out of the 234 aircraft worth over USD 112 billion that Emirates has in its order book, 150 will be the new Boeing 777X aircraft that will be delivered starting 2020. The aircraft will feature a range of passenger focused amenities on board including larger windows, higher ceiling, and a wider cabin in addition to being more fuel efficient than older aircraft.

Pakistan airline mulls Boeing 777X and Airbus A350 jetliners order - The National,"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcGFraXN0YW4tYWlybGluZS1tdWxscy1ib2VpbmctNzc3eC1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtamV0bGluZXJzLW9yZGVyLTEuMTcwNzMx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday.

“Boeing 777X would be a good option,” the airline’s executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, said on the sidelines of an industry conference in Dubai.

The airline is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models, he added.

PIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease.

A sale and leaseback is when the airline sells the jet to a lessor who then leases it back.

Ahmed did not say when PIA would make the order or how many jets it could buy.

PIA has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, Mr Ahmed said, with three A310s to be retired on December 31.

Mr Ahmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 per cent stake.

As part of the turnaround, the airline will spin-off four “special business units” from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses.

The units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams, Mr Ahmed said, adding PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable.

Airbus A350-1000 successfully completed its first flight today - Aviation24.be,"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvbWFudWZhY3R1cmVycy9haXJidXMvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktY29tcGxldGVkLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC10b2RheS_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcnMvYWlyYnVzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTEwMDAtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWNvbXBsZXRlZC1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtdG9kYXkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flight test campaign benefitting from the A350-900 experience and maturity;

Three test aircraft to perform all flight testing in under one year;

Development on track for entry into service scheduled for the second half of 2017.

The first of three A350-1000 development aircraft to fly – MSN059 – has landed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport France at 15.00hrs local time after successfully completing its first flight which lasted four hours and 18 minutes.

The crew in the cockpit on board this flight comprised: Hugues van der Stichel, Experimental Test Pilot; Frank Chapman, Experimental Test Pilot and Gérard Maisonneuve, Test-Flight Engineer. Furthermore, monitoring all the test parameters at the Flight-Test-Instrumentation (FTI) station behind the cockpit were: Patrick du Ché, Head of Flight & Integration Tests; Emanuele Costanzo, Head of A350 Development Flight Tests; and Stéphane Vaux, Flight-Test Engineer.

Powered by Rolls-Royce’s new Trent XWB-97 engines, the aircraft traversed south-western France, during which the crew explored the aircraft’s handling and flight envelope. The aircraft was accompanied by a chase plane to observe and film the various manoeuvres. Its progress was monitored by experts on the ground in real-time via a direct telemetry link.

Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier said:

“We have seen today the world’s most modern and efficient passenger aircraft – the A350-1000 – in action for the very first time, adding soon to the successful A350 Family. My congratulations and thanks go to all the teams who have contributed to make today’s flight happen.” He added: “We are equally pleased that many customers have witnessed this important milestone today together with us – here from our headquarters in Toulouse.”

Benefitting from the experience of the original A350-900 test campaign (accomplished in 2014), the A350-1000’s development programme will be shorter – under one year for the three aircraft. MSN059’s duties for performance testing will include exploration of the flight envelope, handling qualities, loads and braking. The second aircraft to fly, MSN071, will also be tasked with performance evaluation, which will encompass braking, powerplant, systems and autopilot. The third and final aircraft to fly – MSN065 – will be equipped with a cabin and will evaluate the cabin and air systems. MSN065 will also perform the “early long flights” and route-proving. The overall campaign will culminate in the type’s certification followed by its entry into airline service in the second half of 2017 with first operator Qatar Airways – the largest A350-1000 customer to date with 37 on order.

The A350-1000 is the latest member of the Airbus leading widebody family, together with the A330neo, offering unprecedented levels of operating efficiency, low noise and true long-range capability. As well as having a longer fuselage to accommodate 40 more passengers than the A350-900, the A350-1000 also features a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines. The A350-1000 embodies all of the fuel efficiency and ‘Airspace’ cabin comfort of the original A350-900 – but with extra size perfectly tailored for our customers on some of their busiest long-haul routes. To date 11 customers from five continents have placed orders for a total of 195 A350-1000s."

The maiden test flight out of Toulouse Blagnac and over south-western France marked the launch of the aircraft type’s flight-test programme. Three developmental aircraft will prepare the A350-1000 model for certification.

According to Airbus, the A350-1000 will be its largest and most powerful twin-engined commercial airliner ever – and the world’s most fuel-efficient large widebody.

The manufacturer said that the A350-1000’s testing will benefit from the experience gained during the A350-900 test programme conducted in 2014. As a result, it said, the A350-1000’s development programme will be shorter – under a year for the three aircraft.

The aerospace giant hopes that type certification will be followed by the model’s entry into service during the second half of 2017.

The latest addition to Airbus’ family of widebodies, the A350-1000 has a longer fuselage than the A350-900, a modified wing trailing-edge, new six-wheel main landing gears and more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

It has a maximum range of 7,950 nautical miles and, Airbus says, will be capable of supporting the development of long-haul routes for emerging markets such as Shanghai – Boston or Paris – Santiago, as well as more traditional flight segments as Manchester – Los Angeles or Dubai – Melbourne.

Up to now, 11 customers from five continents have placed orders for a total of 195 A350-1000s.
