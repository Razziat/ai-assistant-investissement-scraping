American Orders 460 Narrow Jets from Boeing and Airbus - The New York Times,"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDcvMjEvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsL2FtZXJpY2FuLXBsYWNlcy1yZWNvcmQtb3JkZXItd2l0aC0yLWpldC1tYWtlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — American Airlines announced on Wednesday a record order for 460 single-aisle planes from Airbus and Boeing in a deal worth more than $38 billion. The order breaks the longstanding monopoly that Boeing has had with the airline and forced a significant shift in the company’s strategy.

American, based in Fort Worth, Tex., said that it planned to acquire 260 of the Airbus A320 aircraft and 200 Boeing 737s — half of which will be equipped with a new, more fuel-efficient engine. The move is a clear commitment by Boeing to revamp its best-selling 737 with new engines rather than develop an all-new version of the plane — a strategy that until now it had said most of its customers preferred.

The deal, which American described as the largest commercial aircraft deal in history, also includes options and purchase rights for as many as 465 additional planes through 2025.

The airline said Airbus and Boeing had provided a combined $13 billion in financing through lease transactions, which it said would fully cover the cost of the first 230 deliveries, set to begin in 2013. American said it expected to begin receiving its first Airbus and Boeing aircraft equipped with the more advanced engines starting in 2017."
Do pilots have a preference between Boeing and Airbus? - Slate,"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMTEvMDcvZG8tcGlsb3RzLWhhdmUtYS1wcmVmZXJlbmNlLWJldHdlZW4tYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is bidding to sell 260 planes to American Airlines, which currently has an all-Boeing fleet. The media has focused on the financial aspects of the potential deal, weighing what American Airlines has to gain or lose as a corporation. But what about the pilots? Is there a difference, for them, between flying Airbus and Boeing aircraft?

Absolutely. Airbus and Boeing have different control systems, and most pilots strongly prefer one over the other. (The Explainer isn’t aware of a poll, and so has no way of knowing which manufacturer pilots favor overall.) Modern Airbus planes employ a “fly-by-wire” system. The pilot controls the plane by manipulating a joystick next to the main console and a set of pedals. The movement of the joystick and pedals is translated into electrical signals, which switch on and off machines that move the plane’s flaps, slats, ailerons, and rudder. Most Boeing jets don’t have a joystick, but a more traditional yoke. (The 777 is Boeing’s first fly-by-wire plane.) When a pilot yanks back on the yoke, he’s actually pulling cables that move the plane’s control surfaces with the help of some hydraulic systems. In short, there’s less electronic mediation between the pilot and the machinery in a Boeing aircraft. Some pilots think this gives them a better “feel” in flying the plane, while others prefer the video-gamelike quality of the electronic interface.

Airbus also places more restrictions on how far the pilot is able to push the aircraft. All planes, no matter the manufacturer, must fly within certain limits, known as the “flight envelope,” or risk mechanical failure. For example, if a pilot attempts too steep a climb, the wings may stall. * Airbus aircrafts won’t allow that to happen because they are programmed to ignore the pilot’s instructions if the plane’s computers think they would lead to catastrophe. The system is called “flight envelope protection,” and the pilot has a limited ability to override it by changing its default limits.

The pilot of a Boeing jet has somewhat more freedom to push the envelope. (The phrase “pushing the envelope” was popularized in The Right Stuff, Tom Wolfe’s 1979 book about the daring pilots of the space program.) * For the most part, the flaps and rudder will obey the pilot’s commands, even if those commands might lead to mechanical failure. It’s not easy to get to that point, though. A pilot would have to pull back with significant force to bring the plane into a potentially stall-inducing climb.

It’s not clear whether flight envelope protection makes air travel safer. Advocates argue that it could have prevented the November 2001 crash of an American Airlines jet in Queens, New York. FAA investigators determined (PDF) that the first mate had pushed down the rudder pedals too aggressively in response to turbulence, causing the rudder and its attachments to separate. A captain who had worked with the pilot in the past recounted an earlier incident in which he inappropriately pushed the rudders as far as they would go. (The American Airlines jet in question here was actually an Airbus, not a Boeing, which predated the automatic system. American Airlines retired its last Airbus jet two years ago.)

The problem with flight envelope protection is that pilots occasionally have to take unorthodox actions in desperate situations. Opponents of the system point to the near-crash of China Airlines flight 006 in 1985, in which the pilot managed to recover after an uncontrolled descent of nearly 30,000 feet. It’s possible, though, that a flight protection system would have prevented the descent altogether.

My Review: Flying a Lufthansa Airbus A330 to Frankfurt - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wNy9teS1yZXZpZXctZmx5aW5nLWEtbHVmdGhhbnNhLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLXRvLWZyYW5rZnVydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recently I had the opportunity to fly from Seattle (SEA) to Frankfurt, Germany (FRA) on a Lufthansa Airbus A330 in Business Class. This was my first Lufthansa A330 flight and figured it is time to do a review. I was flown to Germany by the airline to experience the first Airbus A380 flight from Frankfurt to Miami, but getting there is half the fun.

I felt a lot of pressure to get some rest on the flight over to FRA since I was only spending 24hrs there before heading back to the US. Flying in a premium seat better prepares a passenger to arrive well rested and ready to go — something I needed, but never got. The down side of flying in a premium seat, at least for me, is I want to enjoy the experience and I fight sleeping through it.

On the day of the flight, I decided to leave home early to get to the airport. Although Lufthansa does not have their own lounge at SEA, they share one with British Airways in the S-Terminal. I was able to hang out in the lounge for about three hours with free drinks and snacks until my flight was ready to board — never a bad way to spend an afternoon.

Lufthansa flies from Seattle to Frankfurt daily and is the only flight they operate out of Seattle. The great thing about only operating one flight per day is the aircraft was already sitting at the airport and we boarded and departed right on time. I remember the days when an Airbus A340 flew the route (not exactly sure of the dates) but today they have the A330. Luckily for us aviation nerds you can still catch the Air France A340 that flies to Seattle.

Once you get to cruising altitude on a wide bodied airliner, it is easy to forget you are flying. Most people shut their window (even me, I know, I know) to better view your in-flight entertainment screens . A flight on a wide body airliner is just a different experience, even in economy, allowing less of a closed-in feeling. Half way across the ocean, I couldn’t help but stop and realize how amazing it was traveling from Seattle to Frankfurt in just under ten hours. To think what that trip would have entailed just 100 years ago to accomplish the same task makes me happy that airlines offer a much better solution.

The seats provided quite a bit of room and there was a pretty good selection of entertainment, but I wished there was a bit more privacy between me and the person next to me. I have no problem sleeping in economy in standard seats, but when I am lying flat, I feel a bit more exposed and would enjoy more privacy. I also wish the TV screen was closer, since, when lounging back, the screen got smaller. I ran out of movies I wanted to watch on the flight over there, but luckily my flight back was on the A380, which had additional options for me to enjoy.

Up in Business Class, one has ample choices for food during your long trip. There is an appetizer, entree and desert and for each category, you have three choices. I decided on the, “chilled honey roasted Chicken Breast with water crest salad and cranberries, then Zinfandel braised short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and baby carrots and finally finished it up with sage derby, gruyere and cambozola cheese.” The food quality is what would be expected from an international business class experience. I only wish there were more offerings of German in nature. If possible, I prefer to have the cuisine of the airline’s home country versus standard fare. Back in economy, they didn’t have it too shabby either. They didn’t have all the choices, but at least they were still getting meals that looked pretty decent for airline food and it was all free (well included in the price of the ticket).

I know this is silly and really not a reason to choose an airline, but Lufthansa’s warm wash cloths that are handed out at the beginning of the flight and before the meal, smelled amazing. I can’t even tell you what the smell was like, but if they made that into an air freshener I would definitely get it.

After meal service almost everyone in the front of the plane went to sleep. I tried, but it just wasn’t happening. I even took part of a sleeping pill (something I do not usually do while flying), but I never got tired. This was bad news because when we landed it was midnight my time, but 9am local time and I had a full day of events to participate in. I welcomed jet-lag with open arms.

One reason I think I couldn’t sleep was it never got dark outside. The concept was pretty cool, but not getting any sleep wasn’t so cool. Yea, sure, the shades were all down, but mentally, I knew the light was there. Even the eye mask can’t stop the mental sunlight getting in.

Once we landed I was confused when we started taxiing away from the airport. I had forgotten that Frankfurt has many airline parking spaces where buses take people to and from the terminal. This was a bonus for me, being able to de-plane on the tarmac, then taking a five minute bus ride through the airport, but I could see how that would be a huge annoyance for people who are not into planes. I really wouldn’t want to ride an airplane for 10 hours, then get stuck on an even more crowded bus. You better believe the first class passengers are not riding the bus; many get a private Mercedes or Porsche to take them to the terminal.

Lufthansa also has an arrival lounge at FRA, but I was tired and in need of a shower, so I headed out of the airport and to my hotel. The flight went quick and was a great combination of comfort, high-end service and entertainment. I can’t wait until the next international flight.

Boeing vs. Airbus: The fight for flight intensifies - CNN,"Tue, 05 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY25uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA3LzAxL25ld3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2JvZWluZ19haXJidXNfYWlyY3JhZnQuZm9ydHVuZS9pbmRleC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FORTUNE -- The Paris Airshow last month was a clear win for Airbus, but don't count Boeing out just yet. The record number of orders for the Airbus A320neo aircraft at Le Bourget shows the European aircraft maker's success in bringing its current airline customers back on board. But while it was an impressive showing, Airbus failed to make any meaningful inroads into Boeing's core customer base, leaving in place a deadlock between the two aircraft makers in the heavily competitive and extremely profitable single-aisle jet market.

For now, it looks like Boeing's customers are waiting it out to see what the aircraft maker will do with its aging single-aisle workhorse, the Boeing 737. But Boeing shouldn't make them wait too long. Airbus, along with a new crop of foreign competitors, namely the Chinese, is aggressively pitching Boeing's anchor customers. Boeing may need to act fast or it could find that even its most loyal airline clients, like American Airlines and Europe's Ryanair, sign big multi-billion dollar contracts with a competitor.







The single-aisle jet market hardly grabs the headlines, but it is the most important profit center for jet makers. So while Airbus' superjumbo A380 and Boeing's futuristic 787 are important, the truth is, they aren't the big money makers. Boeing's 737 aircraft accounts for around 40% of the jet maker's commercial aviation revenue and well over half of its profits. Meanwhile Airbus still hasn't made a profit from selling its new superjumbo A380.

What keeps these aircraft industry going are the small jets that whisk people several times a day from New York to Houston or from London to Madrid -- not the big transatlantic jets. The cash flow generated by those projects allow the jet makers to splurge on research and development and roll out sexy new products. That's not to say that bigger jets aren't important to the bottom line, they just aren't the backbone of the industry.

For the last few years all the attention at the Paris Airshow has focused on the sexy new projects. This year, though, it was all about the workhorse. Airbus offered up for sale its latest version of the A320, the A320neo, which stands for ""new engine option."" As the name suggests, the jet really isn't a major redesign, it simply has a new engine. Airbus is selling the new plane as an ""efficiency improvement package,"" over older models with improvements including a 15% reduction in fuel consumption allowing it to go farther and hold more cargo. Airbus clearly didn't reinvent the wheel here.

But Airbus customers went gaga over the new jet, which won't even be ready to enter service until the fall of 2015. There was a whopping 667 orders for the new jet at the show, worth around $60.9 billion at market-list prices. Airbus now has 1,029 orders for the new jet, making it the most popular model in civil aviation history.

The sheer number of orders at the show shocked analysts, who were expecting around half that. Leading the way were several Asian airlines, like Malaysia-based AirAsia with 200 orders. Garuda, the Indonesia flag carrier, also got in on the action ordering 15 jets.

Most of the other orders came from long-standing Airbus champions, like JetBlue (JBLU), which ordered 40 of the new jets. Analysts and insiders believe that the only real hit to Boeing was Garuda's 15 plane order, as the flag carrier had been staunchly Boeing for decades.

A 737 tune-up?

The potential loss of Garuda as a core customer doesn't seem to be worrying Boeing's management in Chicago. Nor does the fact they received just 71 new orders for its latest 737 models, the -800 and -900ER, at the air show. Boeing hasn't introduced a radically different version of its 737 in some time, so it was expected to do poorly in the final tallies. Big aircraft orders usually come when there is a new model, and Boeing hasn't rolled out a new version of its 737 workhorse in six years.

That's quite a long stretch to go without a gussied up new aircraft. The company seems to have focused all its energy in the last few years in launching its much-delayed mid-sized 787 aircraft, which finally enters service at the end of the summer.

Boeing understands that it is time to roll out a new 737, but it hasn't decided if it should totally redesign the aircraft, possibly constructing it from the same futuristic composite materials used in the 787, or just slap a new set of fuel-efficient engines to its old aluminum body and calling it a day. It could take an estimated $15 billion or more to redesign the aircraft, Carter Copeland, the aerospace analyst at Barclays Capital, told Fortune. He argues that since the 737 is already so efficient in its current form, it may not be cost-effective for Boeing to make such a big capital expenditure to redesign the aircraft.

""Frankly, there is a lot of financial and technical risk associated with doing a new airplane and Boeing need to be very comfortable with this because these are 'bet the company' type projects,"" Copeland says.

This is at the root of why Boeing has yet to make a decision. Copeland feels that Boeing has up to a year to make the decision, but that may be too late. There are signs that some of Boeing's most loyal customers have started talking to the other side.

Boeing's core customers are still the big U.S. airlines. American Airlines (AMR, Fortune 500) has been a loyal Boeing and McDonnell Douglas (acquired by Boeing in 1996) customer for decades. While it has bought non-Boeing planes for its American Eagle regional jet fleet, American, as its name suggests, prefers American-made aircrafts for its mainline fleet.

The company is now moving to totally revamp its fleet as it moves to retire the dozens of old MD-80 jets it acquired in the 80s and early 90s. The airline at one point had 300 MD-80's up in the sky. But since 2008, the airline has moved to replace them with new 737s, ordering around 119 new 737-800s in 2009 and 2010.

American's fleet is still in need of a major upgrade. But the Dallas-based carrier isn't just looking at Boeing. The new, more fuel-efficient A320neo, has caught the eye of management, according to a person briefed on the matter. Airbus is pushing hard, offering steep discounts to get American to sign on, this person said.

American was expected to announce a large order at the Paris Airshow, but it never came. The company is reportedly in heated negotiations with both Airbus and Boeing at this time with plans to order 250 planes worth around $15 billion. Grabbing American would be a coup for Airbus and would put a seal of approval on the A320neo. That could influence other U.S. carriers to follow its lead. The other mainline U.S. carriers -- US Airways (LCC, Fortune 500), United Airlines and Delta Airlines (DAL, Fortune 500) -- already operate a mix of Airbus and Boeing jets. All of them are in need of an upgrade and finally have some money to put down a deposit -- thanks, in part, to all those new revenue streams, like baggage fees.

Competition from China

The biggest threat to the 737s rein may not be from Airbus, but from China. Core customer Ryanair, one of the big European discount airlines, announced in February that it was in discussions with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, COMAC, to acquire 200 to 400 new aircraft. COMAC is a brand new entrant in the market and has the potential to break the Boeing/Airbus duopoly. Ryan Air currently operates an all Boeing fleet made up of 272 737s and has no outstanding orders for new jets after it receives its last 737 from Boeing in 2012. The airline broke off negotiations with Airbus and Boeing in 2009 because it said it was unhappy with their pricing.

Ryanair, known to be frugal, needs an aircraft that fits its deep discount image. For example, the airline's colorful chief executive, Michael O'Leary, is upset with Boeing for not making an effective locking system for its onboard bathrooms that would allow the airline to start charging its customers to use the toilet. So it isn't surprising that he would be in negotiations with the Chinese to produce a cheap 200-seat airplane. Ryanair has yet to make a decision on whether or not it will abandon Boeing for COMAC, but it looks like it might just take a chance. Other discount airlines, looking to replicate Ryanair's success, may be persuaded to go with COMAC instead of the Boeing 737 when building up their fleets.

Notwithstanding Ryanair's possible defection, Boeing and Airbus seem unfazed by the COMAC threat. After all, it will take years, possibly decades, for the Chinese to become a credible threat in the commercial aviation space. So far, only Chinese airlines have ordered COMAC's prototype c919 jet, with the first jet set to go into service in 2016, five years from now.

While five years may seem like a long time, it's actually pretty standard lag time in the aviation business. Airlines order jets in bulk and take possession of them over several years. That is why it's critical for Boeing to nail down its core customers now, as any loss today would affect its bottom line for the next decade. While the Chinese still have to prove themselves, the Europeans have already shown that the A320 has become a formidable competitor to the 737. It's now up to Boeing to decide how it will respond to the neo threat before any of its key anchor clients decides to get adventurous and try something new.

Update: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Indonesian airline Lion Air placed an order for 200 Airbus jets. In fact it was Malaysia-based airline AirAsia that placed that order."

A deal that could total more than $16.2 billion, it's the largest aircraft order in aviation history.

Single-aisle jets, narrowbody designs arrange two to six passengers abreast along a single, center aisle.

According to USA Today the deal was being closely watched to see if American would shift away from its Boeing-only strategy and welcome Airbus back into its fleet for the first time since 1987.

The deal breaks down as follows:.

Introduced in 1994, the 737-800 is the stretched version of the 700, seats 162 passengers in a two-class layout, and is the direct competitor of the A320. The 737-900 is the most powerful model to date and competes with the Airbus A321.

The Airbus A320 is manufactured in Toulouse, France and Hamburg, Germany, holds about 148 passengers and has a range of between 1,700 to 6,500 nautical miles depending on model.

The A319 is a shortened version of the A320 with extended range. Going the other direction the A321 is the stretch version of the A320, holds about 180 passengers, and is the largest of the A320 family.

Boeing is also looking to match Airbus's financing options, with both companies leasing about half the jets to American, keeping the planes off the airlines' balance sheet.

AMR rose 2 cents to $4.93 in NYSE trading yesterday. Boeing gained 98 cents, 1.4 percent, to $70.53. Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. added 72 cents, 3 percent, to €24.65.

Today's deal comes on the heels of two straight years of losses for American with the company hoping to increases its fleet's fuel efficiency and customer amenities.

The current average age of American's fleet is 16 years, tied for the oldest with Delta.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- American Airlines announced a plan Wednesday to replace one of the largest commercial airline fleets, with hundreds of new leased airplanes from Boeing and Airbus.

AMR Corp, the parent company for American Airlines, said it ordered 460 ""narrow body"" single-aisle jets from the two manufacturers, calling it the largest commercial aircraft order in history.









The airline said this includes 200 jets of the 737 class from Boeing Co., with options to obtain an additional 100 aircraft of the 737 class.

""The increased production of 737s likely will require hundreds of new workers at our Renton factory [in Washington],"" said Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel.

Boeing's (BA, Fortune 500) stock price jumped more than 3% on the news and AMR's (AMR, Fortune 500) stock moved up more than 1%.

AMR also said it would acquire 260 A320 aircraft from Airbus, with an option to acquire 365 more.

""We'll have the youngest fleet among our U.S. peers within five years as a result of this deal,"" said AMR president Tom Horton told CNN International.

AMR said it ""expects to create [the] youngest, most fuel-efficient fleet among U.S. industry peers in approximately five years.""

As part of the deal, America said the manufacturers are providing $13 billion in ""committed financing"" through lease transactions. The retail value of each plane ranges from $80 million to $85 million, according to American.

At the same time, AMR said it plans to spin off its commuter airline subsidiary, American Eagle, as a separate, independent company. AMR also said it would consider selling American Eagle, but would not provide a timeframe as to when this might happen.

Also, AMR reported a net loss of $286 million for the second quarter, which it blamed partly on a 31% year-over-year increase in fuel costs, resulting in additional expenses of $524 million.

AMR said the new aircraft order will reform its fleet with more fuel-efficient planes.

""This new fleet will dramatically improve our fuel and operating costs, while enhancing our financial flexibility,"" said AMR Chief Executive Gerard Arpey.

Boeing said the new 737s are 5% more fuel efficient than the older generation of this class of airplanes, built in the 1990s.

Joe Schwieterman, transportation professor at DePaul University in Chicago, said the new order ""breaks a log jam in aircraft orders. We knew this was coming, but this is bigger than we thought.""

He added that the purchase was inevitable, considering the aging state of AMR's fleet.

""They just can't afford to keep flying with these older planes,"" he said.

The airline industry, led by AMR, Delta Air Lines (DAL, Fortune 500) and the recently merged United Continental (UAL, Fortune 500), has been reducing capacity and striving toward greater fuel efficiency since fuel prices spiked in 2008.

It was on flight SQ11 and SQ12 which is an Airbus A380 that flies to and from Los Angeles (LAX) to Singapore (SIN) with a stop at Narita (NRT) in Tokyo (disclaimer: I was able to fly at no cost by the airline to and from Singapore).

I am pretty big guy, around 6’1″ and 250lbs or so, which means I can truly appreciate a larger seat with a little extra room. Most business class seats do a great job of making me feel comfortable, but Singapore Airlines business class seats border on insanely big. They have a seat pitch of 55″, which is nothing to write home about, but they also have a seat width of 34″ — which is almost three feet. To compare, the international business class seat width on Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 is 20″ and All Nippon Airways Boeing 777-300ER has a respectable width of 21″.

Singapore’s business class seats are arranged in a 1:2:1 layout, meaning every seat has access to an aisle. That eliminates having to trip over a seatmate in the middle of the night to use the restroom. Unfortunately I was not able to catch a window seat to or from Singapore, but with all the available in flight entertainment, who really needs a window anyhow (okay, I was disappointed, but it worked out).

When taking a 20 hour flight twice in one week, there needs to be a decent collection of entertainment. Singapore Airlines came through, giving each passenger easy access to a better-than-average selection of movies, tv shows and music all on demand. You are able to recline back and still easily view the 15.4″ screens. I did end up having a few issues during my flights, where the entertainment system would tweek-out and restart on its own or cause my movie to stop for a bit. This happens to be a common occurrence since I have a knack of causing entertainment systems to crash. For some additional fun, there were quite a few “real” game options that you can play with other passengers, like Tetris and Battleship, but never got around to trying them out.

When it becomes time to sleep, the seats fold flat, but it requires you to stand up and fold the seat-back forward. The manual process was decided on to save the weight of additional mechanics, but it can be a bit annoying when you are about to fall asleep and you have to get back up to make the bed (yeah I know, life is rough). It is all worth the effort — I was able to sleep comfortably for about 7 hours on the flight home.

If you decide to sleep, you risk missing a meal or two — which would be a shame. Because of timing, I enjoyed three different dinners on the way over and two lunches and a dinner on the way back. My first meal started with parma ham and ginger-infused pear, char-grilled vegetables and balsamic dressing. Then the the main entree was seared beef fillet with port wine sauce, mushrooms in spice cream and dessert was New York cheese cake ice cream with cherry compote. Yes, a lot of fancy names, but it actually tasted quite divine.

Just when I thought the formal meal was done, here came a cart with cheese on a cutting board. You tell them what you want and they will cut it up, served with fruit and even a glass of port. Each meal has multiple courses and by the time the cheese cart rolls around you are pretty full. If for some reason you are hungry during the down times, there is still a “light bites” menu available, where you can get anything from noodles, to sandwiches to even a Krispy Kreme doughnut (only from LAX to NRT).

If you are feeling a bit more adventurous there is also an Asian option including seasoned kelp, grilled fresh water eel braised in egg and pike eel roll with kelp. I normally love trying different food, but was not in the right mood. It is always nice to have a drink while dining and if you become thirsty, no worries, you have eight pages of drink options to choose from including the classic Singapore Sling.

ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Singapore Airlines is very proud of their Singapore Girl brand of service and on board my A380 flight there were 23 flight crew. Something I didn’t notice on the way over, but learned while in the Singapore Airlines Training Center, is that the flight attendants have different ranks. Although their uniforms have similar designs, there is a variation of color based on seniority. The majority of men and women serving you will sport the color blue which is entry level. Green are the lead flight attendants in charge of a section and reds are chiefs in charge of each deck. On the A380 there will be one person in charge who sports purple. It became a game to try and find one of each color (hey, it is a long flight).

This is a new flight for the airline and was started on July 1. Singapore Airlines also operates a non-stop from Los Angeles to Singapore using an Airbus A340-500. Why would anyone take the longer trip with a stop in Narita? First, the non-stop flight (SQ37 and SQ38) is the second longest flight in the world and takes about 18 hours. That is a long time to be locked in a aluminum cylinder and some people might be willing to make the trip longer to have the ability to split up the trip with a short stop in Narita. Also, the non-stop flight only has business class seats, so if you are looking to fly first class or economy, the A380 flight is a must. If you are flying business class, the A380 product is similar, but the seats are wider compared to the A340. Probably the most important reason for airline geeks is the ability to fly on an Airbus A380 vs a more common A340.

The first leg of the flight from LAX to NRT was about ten hours before a 1.5 hour lay over in Narita. Flying business class gave me access to the business class lounge, but it was a bit annoying having to get off the aircraft, go through security at Narita, before starting the boarding process.

Los Angeles becomes the eighth destination in Singapore Airline’s network to operate the Airbus A380. They were the first airline to operate the world’s larges airliner in October 2007 and they have clocked around 128,000 flying hours on more than 13,000 flights. The airline currently has 12 A380s in service and seven more on firm order. It is definitely worth the extra time to try out the A380 product and if you are flying economy, you still have a shot to fly on the upper deck.

Now, the bar has been set high. Have you flown in business class seats that you have found to be what you consider “the best”? If so, please tell me about your experience in the comment. Also be sure to check out my other photos of the flight including first class, the lay-flat business class seats, and my seat neighbor who was wearing cowboy boots.

American Airlines plans to add 460 planes starting in 2013 - Cape Cod Times,"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGVjb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMS8wNy8yMS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1wbGFucy10by1hZGQvNDk5NjA3NDQwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines plans to add 460 planes starting in 2013

FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines is buying at least 460 new planes over the next five years in the biggest single passenger jet order in history. And in a victory for Airbus, it's splitting the work between the European plane maker and Boeing.

American said Wednesday it will buy 260 planes from Airbus and 200 from Boeing Co. The new planes promise much-needed fuel savings for the airline — its current fleet is among the industry's least fuel-efficient — and modern amenities like Wi-Fi and video for passengers.

It's a major win for Airbus, which hadn't taken an order from American since the 1980s. It can be seen as a win for Boeing, too, considering that it was in danger of losing the whole order to its European rival.

The jets carry a sticker price of more than $38 billion, although big airlines routinely get discounts and play one aircraft maker off the other to get better deals.

The order is for Airbus' A320 and Boeing's 737, the world's two most widely-used commercial jets. U.S. airlines generally use these single-aisle planes on domestic routes. Current versions of the 737 have 110 to 220 seats. The A320 seats around 150.

The 162-seat 737-800 has a list price of $80.8 million. The list price for the standard A320 is $85 million. Add about $6.2 million for the neo version with faster and more efficient engines.

AMR Corp., American's parent, also announced that it plans to spin off regional carrier American Eagle as a separate company in another cost-cutting move.

The twin announcements overshadowed the news that AMR lost $286 million in the second quarter, as rising fuel prices wiped out an increase in revenue. The loss equaled 85 cents per share. Wall Street was expecting a loss of 77 cents, according to FactSet. Still, AMR shares rose 9 cents to $5.01 in afternoon trading.

American said it got $13 billion in financing commitments from Airbus and Boeing to help buy the new planes. But AMR already has $17.1 billion in debt, and analysts wonder about the wisdom of borrowing more while the company is still posting huge losses.

In recent weeks, the airline industry was riveted by the drama of Airbus and Boeing competing to overhaul American's fleet, which is currently all Boeing aircraft.

In discussions that lasted long into Tuesday night, American decided to buy 200 of the Boeing 737s, with deliveries starting in 2013. Half are expected to be equipped with updated, more fuel-efficient engines. The airline said it will take options for another 100 737s.

American also will buy 260 planes from Airbus's A320 series, with deliveries starting in 2013, and take options and purchase rights for 365 more. Starting in 2017, American will get the first of 130 of a new Airbus plane called the A320neo — for new engine option — which Airbus claims will be 15 percent more fuel-efficient than current jets when it goes into service in late 2015.

American said the new planes will give it the youngest fleet among similar U.S. airlines within five years, although Delta Air Lines Inc. is also considering a large order to update its domestic fleet.

Customers should notice a big difference from American's current MD-80s, which many of the new planes will replace. The newer 737s have better lighting, more overhead space, entertainment systems and on-board Internet access, all of which the MD-80s lack. They're also less noisy.

American has used Airbus planes before, although only a few dozen of them — it grounded the last one in 2009. When American intensified plans to overhaul the fleet a couple of years ago, Chicago-based Boeing was seen as the favorite.

In recent months, Boeing has publicly debated whether to put a new engine on the 737 or take the more radical and costly but perhaps more rewarding move of developing an entirely new plane. Airbus, meanwhile, was forging ahead by taking hundreds of orders for the A320neo.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders called American's decision ""a strong vote of confidence in our product in the important North American market.""

American desperately needed the upgrade. Its fleet of more than 600 planes averages about 15 years in age, among the oldest in the U.S. airline industry. At a time when the airline is paying more than $3 for a gallon of jet fuel, one-third of the fleet consists of fuel-guzzling MD-80s.

""The plan was to replace those MD-80s over seven or eight years,"" said Mike Boyd, an aviation consultant who studied American's fleet for its pilots' union. ""Well, American can't wait that long, not with fuel over $3 a gallon. They've got to unload those MD-80s.""

American said the new planes will burn 35 percent less fuel than MD-80s.

""This is just a no-brainer economic home run from day one when the airplanes show up,"" Arpey said.

The need for fuel-efficiency was evident in AMR's second-quarter results. Revenue rose to $6.11 billion from $5.67 billion a year ago, thanks to higher fares and fees. But American's fuel bill rose 33 percent — an increase of $547 million from the same period last year, outstripping the gain in revenue. Fuel has overtaken labor as the airline's biggest expense.

Analysts expect all the other major airlines to post a profit for the quarter. United Continental Holdings Inc. and US Airways Group Inc. report earnings tomorrow. Delta reports next week."
"Building the A380, the world's largest passenger plane - CNET","Fri, 15 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvYnVpbGRpbmctdGhlLWEzODAtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1wbGFuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a huge Airbus facility just outside Toulouse, France, the aviation giant manufacturers the A380, the largest passenger plane in the world. Kathleen Craig

BLAGNAC, France--What would you do with nearly 6,000 square feet of private airplane?

That's the question I'm asking myself as I look up at what will soon be one of the largest private planes in the world--an Airbus A380 slated for an unknown buyer. Two full decks of luxury in the sky, right in front of me, and sadly, I won't get to see what it looks like.

But I do get to see how A380s are made. As part of Road Trip 2011, I've come here to Airbus' Jean-Luc Lagardere plant, just outside Toulouse, France, where the aviation giant does the final assembly of the A380, the world's largest passenger plane.

There are, of course, longer planes--Airbus' own A340-600, and Boeing's 777-ER and 747-8 Intercontinental--but none of them can carry more passengers. And for anyone who's seen an A380, there's no question why: it's a full double-decker plane, the first of its kind.

Never mind how big the main deck is; the upper deck is as big as a full Airbus A330. All told, the plane can carry 525 passengers in a standard 3-class configuration, and theoretically, more than 800 if the plane was all economy class.

But I'm not here to talk about numbers of passengers. I'm here to see these giant planes get made. The plant, which was purpose-built just for the A380, is the largest industrial building in Europe, according to Riccardo Spimpolo, an A380 product marketing senior analyst and my host for the day.

I've seen big planes getting built before. Several times, I've visited Boeing's Everett, Wash., plant--the biggest building by volume on Earth--and seen that company's assembly of both its 747-400 and all-new 747-8 Intercontinental planes. So I'm somewhat familiar with how these things work.

But stepping inside the plant here, I'm quickly surprised. Here, the A380 is assembled--at least its major exterior components--all at one station. They are shipped here in a convoy, brought inside the building, and then craned over to what's known as Station 40, a giant ""jig,"" Spimpolo calls it, where the plane slowly comes together as one part after another--a wing, the tail, a tail fin--is joined to the giant fuselage.

While Airbus has been doing final assembly on its planes here for years, it needed new space for the A380, so it purchased land near its existing plants and put this building up. In 2005, the first A380 was assembled here, joining major components that were manufactured in Airbus plants in Germany, England, France, and Spain.

Currently, an A380 spends a little more than a week in the jig at Station 40, Spimpolo said, and for now, that means one new plane is being assembled at a time. The plant's capacity allows it to turn out four A380s a month, but at the moment, that pace is more like 2.5 a month, he explained. By about the end of 2012, the plant should be up to capacity.

The Airbus A380 is assembled inside a giant set of scaffolding known as a jig at a company facility near Toulouse, France.

Once assembly of the major components is done, the plane is backed out of the building and brought in through the next (giant) door over, where it will be parked at one of three slots in what's known as Station 30. There, all the A380's interior systems will be added--electrical, hydraulics, the cockpit, doors, engines, and so on. Airbus can work on three different A380s at a time in Station 30, and indeed today, there are three lined up here, including what will surely soon be the winner of the world's most decadent private plane award. There are also two A380s being worked on for a major European airline.

The planes will be at Station 30 for about three weeks, Spimpolo said, after which they are taken outside for a monthlong series of final work-throughs that include cabin pressurization, fuel leak, and engine tests. After that, you've basically got an A380 that's ready to go, and each plane at this point is flown to Hamburg, Germany, where it is then painted, fitted with its interior cabinetry, and handed over along with its keys, to its new owner.

At some point, Spimpolo said, this whole operation could be doubled in size. The plant was specifically built twice as big than is needed for current production with the idea that someday, the A380 market might demand twice as many planes. If that happens, you'd basically take the entire process described above, and replicate it: two planes at Station 40, six at Station 30, and so on. Assembly would not be any faster.

The jig

Given that the A380 is the world's largest passenger plane, you don't expect it to be essentially swallowed up by the giant scaffolding that surrounds the area where it's assembled. Yet walking inside the facility here, that was pretty much exactly my first impression.

And that should give you a sense of the size of the jig. Actually, though, the jig has two major components: one for the front of the plane, from in front of its wings to the nose, and another for the wings and behind. The front section is fixed in place, and anchored to the ground, because the tools that are used for the assembly of the front of the plane need to be completely stable. But from the wings back, the jig is movable, on a set of tracks in the ground, that allow it to slide out of the way so the plane can be backed out of the building after its time at Station 40 is done.

But while you would never want to trivialize the complexity of building a giant airplane like the A380, it seems that at Station 40, at least, assembly boils down to a case of fitting a group of carefully selected pieces together. Writ very large, of course. Spimpolo makes this point when showing me the end of a wing laid out on the floor of the building: all the systems inside the wing are a bit further down its length. At the very end are the elements that will fit nicely into place in the fuselage. The same goes for the tail, the tail fins, and so on.

--Riccardo Spimpolo, Airbus product marketing senior analyst ""It's a very, very delicate process."" The workers have to be ""very gentle, very exact, and very perfect.""

Over at Station 30, one of the first things you see is that this giant plane seems to be floating--and in a way it is. Its front wheel is, in fact, about 5 feet off the ground, the fuselage having been lifted up that far so the landing gear can be installed from below. Once the landing gear is fully joined, the plane can finally be lowered down to rest on its own weight.

Then there are the engines. They are one of the only major components that don't come on the convoys that snake their way through the French countryside from a port in Bordeaux to the plant here. That's because the engines are the property of the planes' owners, even before they take delivery of the A380s, Spimpolo said. The airlines negotiate the purchase of the engines directly from Rolls-Royce or the Engine Alliance (General Electric and Pratt & Whitney), the two makers of A380 engines. ""We receive, install, and keep [them] for the shortest possible [time],"" Spimpolo said. Airbus doesn't ""intervene"" in that process.

Quiet

My tour of the A380 final assembly plant took place on a normal weekday afternoon, but walking into the giant building, I would have sworn it was a weekend. There was (almost) none of the industrial racket I'd grown used to from visits to other manufacturing facilities--drilling, hammering, sawing, soldering, and so on. Instead, it was eerily quiet, especially when we moved to Station 30.

I mentioned that to Spimpolo, who agreed that it was quiet on the floor. But then he pointed out that in fact, there were hundreds of people, if not more, at work on the three planes at Station 30--they were just all inside the three soon-to-be A380s. From the outside, though, it might as well have been a holiday. But maybe it was just because of the nature of the work. ""It's a very, very delicate process,"" Spimpolo said of working on an A380. The workers have to be ""very gentle, very exact, and very perfect.""

Flying real estate

So now the tour is at an end, and we're staring at the private A380, thinking about the nearly 6,000 square feet of flying real estate, and wondering what it will be like inside. Even my hosts--Spimpolo and a woman from Airbus communications--have no idea how that plane will be outfitted. Airbus doesn't do that work--for private customers, the interior is designed by a third party. But our imaginations start to run wild. Movie theaters. Bowling alleys. Swimming pools (can that even be done?). We'd all like to know. But we never will."

American hopes that this purchase will help get it out of its current financial troubles: In the second quarter, parent company AMR lost a whopping $286 million as increased fuel prices overwhelmed a boost in revenue.

American is getting the majority of its new planes from European manufacturer Airbus, which has taken a commanding lead in production of the fuel efficient, climate-friendly aircraft the aviation industry is demanding. The move is a further blow to Boeing, the traditional U.S. market leader, which has struggled to keep pace: American hadn’t ordered an Airbus plane in 20 years.

Among the planes American is ordering from Airbus is the A320neo, which the company says is 15 percent more fuel efficient than aircraft currently in service. The neo was the star of the Paris Air Show, where Airbus racked up a further 730 new plane orders, compared to just 142 for Boeing.

As I wrote a few weeks ago, Airbus’ success at delivering the fuel efficient, climate-friendly planes airlines are demanding is giving Europe an enormous green jobs dividend. Its lead at the Paris air show alone amounted to an estimated 1 million additional jobs for workers in Toulouse, Hamburg, and Seville, and today’s announcement will deliver even more. This advantage didn’t come from nowhere: It reflects a more intense focus on efficiency and climate in European business, driven in part by Europe’s climate law, which is about to require emissions reductions in the aviation sector.

Stelios, whose family speaks for about 38% of the carrier, gave a cautious reception to the order of 15 Airbus A320 aircraft when it was announced in January, but has now revisited the deal.

In an 11-page letter to easyJet's chairman, Sir Michael Rake, he said the board should have sought shareholder approval for the order and investors should vote before any further payments are made to Airbus. He added that the catalogue price for an A320, at $85m, was substantially higher than the $51m cited in an easyJet document in 2006.

An easyJet spokesman said: ""The commercial value of the deal reflected substantially less than the current Airbus list prices for the aircraft.""

Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: ""Stelios is re-emphasising his position in the ongoing debate about medium-term growth and cash returns, looking to head off a further aircraft order and to secure more cash returns for shareholders.""

Haji-Ioannou has been locked in an on-off dispute with the easyJet board since a brand dispute erupted in 2008. The branding row has since been resolved."
American Airlines Orders 460 New Boeing and Airbus Jets - NYCAviation,"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA3L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLW9yZGVycy00NjAtbmV3LWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWpldHMvMTY1NzfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an effort to build the “youngest fleet in the US,” American Airlines on Wednesday morning announced orders for 460 new Boeing and Airbus narrowbody aircraft, the largest in airline history.

Ending weeks of speculation, the order will be split between the world’s two largest airframers, with further divisions among current generation and re-engined versions of the venerable 737 and A320 families of aircraft.

Airbus A320-family jets will make up 260 of the new planes, including the first “neo” jets delivered to the United States. They have not yet said which A320 models will be delivered, but images on the American Airlines website seem to indicate A319 and A321 aircraft will be involved. American says the Airbus deal offers the flexibility to pick any variant of the A320 family. Deliveries of 130 current generation aircraft will begin in 2013, while 130 neo’s will start entering the fleet in 2017.

Boeing will also deliver 200 new 737’s, including 100 re-engined aircraft powered by CFM LEAP-X engines. Boeing has not yet formally announced its plans for this 737 update, but a decision is expected in the fall. The first 100 jets will be current generation 737s fitted with the Boeing Sky Interior. Like the Airbus deal, American will have the ability to choose from any plane in the current 737 catalog. Boeing deliveries will also start in 2013.

American will have substantial options on both orders, with rights to buy up to 365 extra A320s from Airbus, 40 additional current generation Boeing 737s and 60 re-engined 737s.

The airline says the first 230 planes from both manufacturers, worth about $13 billion, will be acquired through “lease transactions that will help maximize balance sheet flexibility and reduce risk.”

The order marks the largest in history, breaking a record set by AirAsia last month when it ordered 200 Airbus A320neo’s. It is the first Airbus order from American since 1987, when it ordered the Airbus A300.

An American Airlines news conference scheduled for 11 am EDT may shed more light on the details.

They said the twin-engine widebody with 210 seats initially would revolutionize air travel, using a lightweight carbon-composite skin to save fuel and enable larger windows and a more pressurized and humidified cabin. Boeing promised better air filtration, a smoother ride and spacious overhead luggage compartments.

The Dreamliner may well deliver on the flight improvements. But as more than 800 orders for the $185 million plane piled up from airlines, the ambitious high-tech advances and far-flung manufacturing process caused world-class headaches. The delays gave Airbus time to develop its A350, a carbon-composite plane the Europeans claim will carry more passengers, fly farther and burn less fuel than the Dreamliner.

""The A350 is going to be a whale of a competitor,"" said analyst

, president of the Boyd Group in Evergreen, Colo. ""If Boeing could have brought out the 787 three years ago like they were supposed to, it really could have hurt Airbus.""

Even Boeing managers, whose predecessors were cavalier about the Dreamliner's challenges, say the company will reevaluate offshoring strategies for future planes. Yet Boeing's bacon may be saved by massive overall demand for jetliners.

Boeing expects a $4 trillion world market for new aircraft over the next 20 years. Airlines must replace aging fleets. China and other emerging nations are expanding aviation. And most importantly, carriers need fuel-efficient planes.

So Boeing is boosting commercial aircraft production by 40 percent over the next three years.

The Dreamliner is designed to consume 20 percent less fuel than the similarly sized Boeing 767. Boeing, based in Chicago with its largest manufacturing operations in Puget Sound, designed the Dreamliner as a smaller twinjet as opposed to its 747, which carries more than 400 passengers in some configurations.

The switch is hugely significant, because the smaller, more efficient 787 challenges the hub-and-spoke pattern of conventional flying. Commercial airlines could use the Dreamliner to shift toward point-to-point flights, boosting midsize airports such as Portland International Airport, which would offer more nonstop routes to domestic and international destinations.

As Boeing developed the smaller Dreamliner, Airbus initially concentrated on its

the world's largest passenger airliner, which entered service in 2007. The $300 million double-deck Superjumbo can carry more than 800 passengers and fly nonstop from Hong Kong to New York.

But as the economics of the business changed, the competition between the Dreamliner and the

heated up. Airbus has booked more than 560 orders at prices between $236 million and $300 million for the 350, whose scheduled launch is slipping later into 2013. Boeing has more than 820 orders for the Dreamliner.

Boeing managers insist they have the upper hand, maintaining the 787 has superior technology.

""It's lighter, more technologically advanced, has a lower fuel burn, lower maintenance costs, lower airport fees and significantly lower operating costs than the competition,"" said Jennifer Cram, a Boeing spokeswoman. ""Clearly, having an airplane that will soon be in operation and proven in the market puts us in the perfect position.""

'No shortage of challenges'





Reporters on a tour of the gigantic hangar housing the Everett assembly line earlier this year encountered Justin Hale, the 787 project's chief mechanic, standing on the viewing balcony. Below, workers swarmed around jets in various stages of production.

Hale acknowledged the sprawling production network and the ambitious advances caused problems.

""There just has been no shortage of challenges along the way,"" Hale said. ""It's different in so many ways from any other airplane we've ever done.""

Everett workers are producing two 787s a month. They plan to reach 10 a month by late 2013, split between Everett and North Charleston, S.C. The company is also boosting production of the Boeing 777. It's cranking out 747-8s, both as freighters and passenger jets.

Hale, who now markets the plane, said its complexity holds both peril and promise.

Boeing confirmed Monday, for example, that it's suspending final assembly of the 787 in Everett for about 20 days to address supply-chain issues. The

continues to pursue a complaint against Boeing for allegedly retaliating illegally against its largest union when it decided in 2009 to put a second Dreamliner assembly line in a nonunion South Carolina plant.

Hale said carbon-fiber composites, which replace aluminum, account for about half the weight of each 787. The light, strong fuselage material is what cuts fuel consumption and enables larger window cutouts, increased cabin pressure and higher humidity. Fuselage panels are produced in tubes, not panels as in previous aircraft, changing the way the long-range plane is made and how it flies.

""The wing is a different shape than we've ever built before,"" Hale said. ""It helps us achieve more lift with less drag."" A traditional metal wing could not deliver that performance, he said.

Hale's excitement about the plane is palpable. ""It's humidified to a higher level. That helps prevent sinuses from drying out. Gaseous filtration removes food odors, people odors, things like perfumes, evaporated alcohols and all those things that irritate sinuses.""

Outsourcing added costs





Such technological innovation was a tall order on top of Boeing's far-flung manufacturing operation. Earlier this year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Jim Albaugh acknowledged during a Seattle talk that the attempt to cut costs through global outsourcing backfired.

""We spent a lot more money in trying to recover than we ever would have spent if we'd tried to keep the key technologies closer to home,"" Albaugh said. Boeing had to support, compensate or buy out some manufacturing partners to rescue the process.

Two New York professors studied Boeing's outsourcing and concluded that the company had handed out tricks of the trade that would sharpen the competitiveness of Japan, which aims to enter the aircraft manufacturing business.

""This does not bode well for the Western aerospace sector,"" wrote David Pritchard and Alan MacPherson, ""since the Japanese government has recently funded a research program to produce a regional jet aircraft.""

Boeing's Hale responded that the technology stream has often flowed in reverse, as Boeing benefits from innovation by its suppliers. But he granted that glitches in the sprawling manufacturing network would force reassessment.

""The challenges in our production system have absolutely given us cause to go back and see if this is the right business model,"" Hale said. ""Where it's warranted, we'll make adjustments.""

Yet the fundamental trend of using foreign suppliers isn't apt to change.

""There are certainly countries where it's important for them to have a piece of the pie,"" Hale said. ""They may not ever consider purchasing a Boeing airplane if we're not interested in the economy of their country.""

In Japan on Tuesday, crews flying a Dreamliner jet completed a week of tests designed to simulate operating conditions. Sometime in August or September, Boeing plans to make its first commercial delivery of a 787, to Japan's

., which has ordered 55 Dreamliners.

Welcoming the test plane to Japan this month, All Nippon Chief

quoted a Japanese proverb: ""A child who is born from a difficult delivery is tenfold more loved."""
American Airlines puts in order for 460 new jets | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTEvanVsLzIxL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXB1dHMtb3JkZXItNDYwLW5ldy1qZXRzLTIwMTEwNzIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"— American Airlines is buying at least 460 new planes over the next five years in the biggest single passenger jet order in history. And in a victory for Airbus, it’s splitting the work between the European plane maker and Boeing.

American said Wednesday that it will buy 260 planes from Airbus and 200 from Boeing Co., which has headquarters in Chicago. The new planes promise much-needed fuel savings for the airline — its current fleet is among the industry’s least fuel-efficient — and modern amenities such as wireless Internet access and video for passengers.

It’s a win for Airbus, which hadn’t taken an order from American since the 1980s. It can be seen as a positive order for Boeing, too, considering that it was in danger of losing the whole deal to its European rival.

The jets altogether carry a sticker price of more than $38 billion, although big airlines routinely get discounts and play one aircraft maker off the other to get better deals.

Analysts said American’s decision will put pressure on other airlines with aging fleets to buy new planes too.

Gerard Arpey, the chairman and chief executive of American’s parent, AMR Corp., sat between the leaders of Airbus and Boeing on Wednesday as he discussed the unusual deal at an airport news conference. He called it “a watershed event certainly for our company and indeed for the airline industry.”

The order is for Airbus’ A320 and Boeing’s 737, the world’s two most widelyused commercial jets. U.S. airlines generally use these single-aisle planes on domestic routes. Current versions of the 737 have 110 to 220 seats. The A320 seats around 150.

The 737-800 has a list price of $80.8 million. The list price for the A320 is $85 million.

AMR Corp. also announced that it plans to spin off regional carrier American Eagle as a separate company in another cost-cutting move.

“Strategically for AMR, it would be beneficial, as we could, over time, diversify our regional feed with additional regional airlines to ensure we have access to the most competitive rates and service,” Arpey said. “A divestiture could provide Eagle an opportunity to vie for business of other mainline carriers and allow the carrier to grow.”

The twin announcements overshadowed the news that AMR lost $286 million in the second quarter, as rising fuel prices wiped out an increase in revenue. The loss equaled 85 cents per share. Wall Street was expecting a loss of 77 cents, according to FactSet. AMR Corp. shares fell 1 cent to close at $4.92.

In recent weeks, the airline industry was riveted by the drama of Airbus and Boeing competing to overhaul American’s fleet, which is currently all Boeing aircraft.

In discussions that lasted long into Tuesday night, American decided to buy 200 of the Boeing 737s, with deliveries starting in 2013. Half are expected to be equipped with updated, more fuel-efficient engines. The airline said it will take options for another 100 737s.

American also will buy 260 planes from Airbus’ A320 series with deliveries starting in 2013, and take options and purchase rights for 365 more. Starting in 2017, American will get the first of 130 of a new Airbus plane called the A320neo — for new engine option — which Airbus claims will be 15 percent more fuelefficient than current jets.

“This is just a no-brainer economic home run from day one when the airplanes show up,” Arpey said.

American said the new planes will give it the youngest fleet among similar U.S. airlines within five years, although Delta Air Lines Inc. is also considering a large order to update its domestic fleet.

“AMR had to make a bold move,” said Ray Neidl, a Maxim Group analyst, in a note to investors.

“These moves in our opinion are not only positive for the company’s future but are necessary for its long-term survival.”

Aviation consultant Darryl Jenkins agrees that the new planes will boost American’s image with travelers.

“This is almost American rebranding itself,” he said. “Before, they were old and tired, and now they’re going to be young and energetic.”

Customers should notice a big difference from American’s current MD-80s, which many of the new planes will replace. The newer 737s have better lighting, more overhead space and entertainment systems, which the MD-80s lack. They’re also less noisy.

American said it will move toward having on-board Internet across its domestic fleet, and the new planes will have better seats in both coach and first class, American said.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders called American’s decision “a strong vote of confidence in our product in the important North American market.” Airbus is part of European Aeronautics Defense & Space Co. Shares of EADS rose 3.6 percent to $35.25 in Paris. Boeing shares rose $1.54, or 2.2 percent, to close at $72.07.

American’s fleet of more than 600 planes has an average age of about 15 years, among the oldest in the U.S. airline industry. At a time when the airline is paying more than $3 for a gallon of jet fuel, one-third of the fleet consists of fuel-guzzling MD-80s.

“The plan was to replace those MD-80s over seven or eight years,” said Mike Boyd, an aviation consultant who studied American’s fleet for its pilots’ union. “Well, American can’t wait that long, not with fuel over $3 a gallon. They’ve got to unload those MD-80s.”

The need for fuel-efficiency was evident in AMR’s second-quarter results. Revenue rose to $6.11 billion from $5.67 billion a year ago, thanks to higher fares and fees. But American’s fuel bill rose 33 percent — an increase of $547 million from the same period last year, outstripping the gain in revenue. Fuel has overtaken labor as the airline’s biggest expense.

Military used unarmed Airbus for Kandahar airlift after U.A.E. flap - Red Deer Advocate,"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGRlZXJhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vdW5jYXRlZ29yaXplZC9taWxpdGFyeS11c2VkLXVuYXJtZWQtYWlyYnVzLWZvci1rYW5kYWhhci1haXJsaWZ0LWFmdGVyLXUtYS1lLWZsYXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The loss of a not-so secret base in Dubai last year forced the Canadian military to use its unarmed Airbus planes for flights into Kandahar Airfield during the final phase of the combat mission, ministerial briefing notes say.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The loss of a not-so secret base in Dubai last year forced the Canadian military to use its unarmed Airbus planes for flights into Kandahar Airfield during the final phase of the combat mission, ministerial briefing notes say.

“Pressures imposed by the closure of Camp Mirage and the need to maximize flexibility in providing strategic airlift to support OP Athena have culminated in the (censored) using C-150 flights in KAF,” said a Nov. 1, 2010, briefing note prepared for Defence Minister Peter MacKay.

The Canadian military designates its Airbus passenger jets as the CC-150 Polaris but often refers to it simply as the C-150.

The air force initially certified the Airbus aircraft to fly into the war zone in 2007. But their use, according to the documents, was considered a “last resort” and a “calculated risk” by commanders on the ground.

The planes were given two trial runs into Kandahar in August and September last year, before Canada was evicted from Camp Mirage in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Their further use was to be approved by the commander of the 1st Canadian Air Division “on a case-by-case basis,” said the documents obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.

The air force has five Airbus aircraft. There were plans to use them sporadically during the recently completed withdrawal of combat troops from Kandahar. The time-honoured practice through much of the mission had been to use them to fly between Canada and Dubai.

Once in Dubai, soldiers and even VIPs would switch to a rugged turbo-prop C-130 Hercules transport for the two-hour flight into Kandahar. The Airbus planes do not have a defensive suite to deflect incoming missiles and are generally considered a civilian aircraft not suited for a war zone.

An air force official who spoke on background said the C-150 was always considered a “back-pocket capability” to be used only when necessary.

The closure of Camp Mirage following a diplomatic spat with the U.A.E. over commercial landing rights proved to be one of those occasions.

The airbase was a critical logistics and supply point for Canada’s mission in Afghanistan, and the loss of its use complicated the military withdrawal as the combat mission was coming to an end.

As a stopgap, the military routed Canadian flights through Cyprus.

Use of the Airbus planes was considered sensitive enough to be the subject for two briefing notes for MacKay in 2010, and for the chief of defence staff to ask for the minister’s permission to use them to bring home the Task Force Kandahar headquarters unit last fall.

Officials told MacKay the threat and risk situation was “stable.”

The scramble to get out of Camp Mirage put a strain on the air force as almost nine years worth of equipment was packed up in a hurry and flown out, according to the records.

Relations between Canada and the U.A.E. have remained frosty. Canadian visitors face the imposition of visas costing between $200 and $1,000.

A few weeks ago, the Conservative government inked an agreement with Kuwait to establish a replacement staging area.

Brig.-Gen. Charles Lamarre, in charge of the Kandahar withdrawal, says the arrangement will ease some of the transport strain. It may help the military get everything out of Kandahar before the December deadline set by Parliament, depending upon how quickly the packing and sorting can be done.

“It’s closer,” Lamarre said in a recent interview. “If by chance the production lines can surge ahead a little, certainly that advantage in transportation will be to our advantage.”

Not having to fly to Cyprus means the air force could potentially lay on more than the 18 C-17 cargo flights it had planned.

The military is flying out sensitive equipment and vehicles, and loading them onto a container ship for the trip back to Canada."

Australian Business Traveller has put together these exclusive pictures of the next-generation aircraft -- so join us for a walk through the sci-fi experience of flying in 2050...

The plane of the future is angular -- presumably made of carbon fibre or some exciting new material -- and has two engines underneath the main body.

Airbus hasn't suggested how you'll get into your plane in 2050 -- still a jetbridge, most likely.

The door's in the centre of the plane, and is an interesting trapezoidal shape for reasons best known to Airbus.

Instead of business and economy class, Airbus suggests that it'll be called ""Vitalising"" and ""Smart Tech"". That'll be two Smart Tech tickets for Melbourne, please...

At the back of the bus in Smart Tech, Airbus reckons there'll be a 3-3 layout, although we find it hard to imagine that the aisle will be that big on a production aircraft. Surely 2050 hover-trolleys won't need that much room as they deliver your pellet sandwiches.

In a leaf taken out of the convertible ""Eurobusiness"" seats, where the same seats serve for Business and Economy on short-haul flights in the EU (and on some Qantas flights), the cabin is rearranged based on how full the plane is. Except instead of a curtain and a little winch, it'll all happen automagically.

You'll be sitting on ""morphing seats"", Airbus reckons. We think the glowing blue might put people off, but then again we didn't think that airline seatback massage functions would work either. (We were right about the seatback massage functions.)

If you walk forward form ""Smart Tech"" towards ""Vitalising"", you'll come to the central multi-function pod, where you entered the plane. Airbus suggests this will be the work, play and relaxation centre of the plane of the future.

Virtual golf will be just one of the options for play in the central pod. From the stick men, it also looks like Airbus will offer running, judo, baseball and tennis.

The central pod will also be available for meetings and presentations. Unfortunately, it looks like PowerPoint will still be around in 2050.

The middle part of the pod raises up out of the floor to become a bar. No info yet on whether it will be available to Smart Tech passengers or reserved for Vitality travellers...

At the front of the plane in VItalising class, the roof has been replaced by a membrane, which can turn completely clear. Seating is in a comfortable 2-2-2 layout, and the view can't be beat.

The seats swivel to follow the view, although we can't imagine that having them all swivel at the same time will be particularly popular.

The panoramic view out the front is pretty impressive, since the pilots are on a lower level.

""Sound showers"" spread out above the seats at night -- but what are they? Noise cocoons? Sonic washing devices? In-flight entertainment audio?

The cockpit seems to be tucked just underneath the panoramic windows above...but what takes up the rest of the plane? Cargo alone, or some quiet, dark bunks to get some proper rest?

So that's Airbus' vision of the plane of the future. What's your favourite bit, or what would you like to see? Share your thoughts on Twitter (@AusBT) or in a comment below."
American Airlines places massive order with Airbus - SKNVibes.com,"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2tudmliZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2RldGFpbHMuY2ZtLzM0ODQ40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(WASHINGTON, USA) - American Airlines has announced a record order for 460 aircraft worth some $38 billion from Airbus and Boeing that breaks Boeing's monopoly grip on its fleet.

American Airlines parent AMR Corp. said it would buy 200 Boeing 737s and 260 Airbus A320 jets in the ""largest aircraft order in history.""

The split order marks a huge victory for the European aircraft manufacturer and ends Boeing's 1996 exclusive contract to supply airplanes to American.

Both the US aerospace giant and Airbus are selling more fuel-efficient versions of their popular single-aisle passenger jets as part of the massive deal.

Chairman and chief executive Gerard Arpey said that AMR expects to have ""the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet among our peers in the US industry within five years.

""This new fleet will dramatically improve our fuel and operating costs, while enhancing our financial flexibility,"" he said.

American, the fourth-ranked US carrier in terms of passengers, behind Delta, United and Southwest, also said it has options for 365 additional Airbus aircraft and 100 Boeing 737s.

The total order is worth $38 billion at list prices -- $23 billion for Airbus, and $15 billion for Boeing -- but planes are often sold at sharp discounts.

The Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR did not reveal the amount of the order, but said it had $13 billion of committed financing from Boeing and Airbus through lease transactions which fully covers the first 230 plane deliveries.

""Although the order was split between Boeing and Airbus, we believe it is more positive for Airbus, as it was able to gain American Airlines, which currently has an all-Boeing fleet, as a customer,"" ratings agency Standard & Poor's said.

Deliveries will begin in 2013, with American becoming the first US airline to take delivery of ""next-generation"" versions of both the 737 and A320 in 2017.

AMR said the agreements with Boeing and Airbus were part of American's strategy to simplify its fleet from four aircraft types -- MD-80, 737-800, 757 and 767-200 -- to two: Boeing's 737 and the A320 families.

American also intends to order 100 of Boeing's expected new fuel-efficient 737NG, with options for 60 more.

""American is pleased to be the first airline to commit to Boeing's new 737 family offering, which is expected to provide a new level of economic efficiency and operational performance, pending final confirmation of the program by Boeing,"" AMR said.

Boeing said the new airplane would be powered by CFM International's LEAP-X engine.

The Leap-X engine, still under development by the US-French company, a joint venture between General Electric of the United States and France's Snecma, is one of two available on Airbus's A320neo (new engine option) planes.

American said it will buy 130 of the A320neos.

Launched in December, the fuel-efficient plane was a star attraction at the Paris Air Show last month. Malaysian airline AirAsia ordered 200 A320neos, at the time a record single order for any Airbus aircraft.

Boeing's decision to offer its best-selling 737 with a new engine, after it was generally expected to instead build an all-new fuel-efficient plane, was seen as forced by the competition from the A320neo.

Airbus, the France-based unit of EADS, hailed the American order as a ""strong endorsement"" of the company's single-aisle planes.

""We are extremely proud and gratified once again to count American Airlines among Airbus's global customers,"" Airbus president and chief executive Tom Enders said in a separate statement.

American's fleet has not included an Airbus plane since 2009.

AMR separately announced Wednesday a net loss of $286 million for the second quarter, citing higher fuel costs.

Revenue was $6.11 billion, up 7.8 percent from a year ago, in line with forecasts.

AMR also announced it was spinning off its regional carrier American Eagle after a 26-year partnership and closing its reservations office in Dublin, Ireland, to reduce its operating costs.

Investors initially welcomed the news, pushing up AMR and Boeing shares in New York trade. AMR shares closed 0.2 percent lower as the broader market fell, while Boeing bucked the downtrend, surging 2.2 percent."

Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates already fly the A380 on the lucrative ""Kangaroo Route"" between Sydney and London, but Lufthansa will join the club with daily flights from 31 October 2011.

Lufthansa currently uses older and smaller Boeing 747-400 planes on the route, so if you wanted to burn some Star Alliance frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the new 747 seat + bed first class, you'll need to pick another route.

Business travellers from Australia are likely to see some introductory fare discounts, with connecting flights to Singapore from Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney on Lufthansa's Star Alliance partners Singapore Airlines.

On the plane Lufthansa's A380s have eight first class seats (and an award-winning lavatory) at the front of the upper deck, and then the entire rest of the top floor is Business Class.

But Lufthansa has crammed in 98 lie-flat angled business class seats in a 2-2-2 configuration rather than the fully flat beds that its Star Alliance partner Singapore Airlines and competitors Qantas and Emirates use.

Why are fully flat beds better than lie-flat angled seats? Don't miss our exposé on the Lie-Flat Lie for the lowdown.

So if you're planning to fly Business, we'd recommend picking a Singapore Airlines flight instead -- and don't forget our guide to picking the best seats in Singapore Airlines' A380 Business Class.

Downstairs on the main deck is an all-Economy configuration of 420 seats, from rows 50-94.

More Lufthansa flights makes this an excellent time to get free Lufthansa Miles & More frequent flyer status -- registration for that deal closes on 31 May.

Tibet Airlines Co Ltd (TAC) took to the skies on Tuesday, as the highest region of China prepares to welcome more domestic and international visitors.

The airline was certified to conduct commercial flights on the same day.

The carrier's only aircraft, an Airbus A319 that was delivered on July 2, flew from Lhasa to Ngari, a city in the west of the region.

TAC plans to offer four services a day connecting Lhasa, Ngari and Chengdu, in Sichuan province. Each flight will take about two hours.

TAC is based at the Lhasa Gonggar Airport, which at an elevation of 3,600 meters is one of the world's highest civilian airports.

Cheng Hui, executive director of Tibet Airlines said TAC is seeking permission for non-stop Lhasa-Beijing flights that it aims to launch by the end of the year.

There are no direct services between the two cities at present, so the flying time is about six hours, with a stopover in Chengdu or Chongqing. The non-stop flight will only take about four hours, Chen said.

""We should be the first choice for passengers to or from Lhasa,"" Chen told China Daily.

TAC also hopes to expand into Europe.

""Tibet is attractive to European travelers and we will have the ability to operate international routes in three years,"" Chen said.

Statistics from the China Tibet Tourism Bureau show that 6,400 foreign visitors came to Tibet in the first quarter. The region had 228,000 visitors in 2010.

However, the 16 air routes now available to Tibet, including an international link between Lhasa and Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, cannot meet increasing foreign demand for seats.

Liu Yanping, general manager of Tibet Airlines, said the carrier also wants to have direct routes to Europe within four or five years.

The airline plans to have about 20 aircraft by 2015 and routes serving key cities around the nation in the next year, said Liu. Flights to South Asia and Southeast Asia are expected by 2013.

TAC ordered three A319s, and the other two are scheduled for delivery in Lhasa in August and September.

Tibet Airlines' A319s accommodate 128 passengers in a two-class configuration, with eight seats in premium and 120 in economy class.

Flying above the roof of the world requires more powerful engines, and Airbus modified its engines to TAC's specifications, said Thorsten Eckhoff, who works at Airbus in customer support.

The systems on the A319s were also modified to supply oxygen for 55 minutes, compared with the usual time of 22 minutes for aircraft that don't serve the plateau region, Tao Wenge, press and information director of Airbus China Ltd, said.

Airbus set up a customer service office in Lhasa in June to offer on-the-spot technical assistance, he added."
The best 'Upper Class' seats on Virgin Atlantic's Airbus A340-600 - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYmVzdC1zZWF0cy1pbi11cHBlci1jbGFzcy1idXNpbmVzcy1vbi12aXJnaW4tYXRsYW50aWMtYWlyYnVzLWEzNDAtNjAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flying business class from Sydney to Hong Kong or London on Virgin Atlantic's flights? Australian Business Traveller brings you the latest in our ongoing series on the best seats to pick for your flight.

This week: Virgin Atlantic's award-winning Upper Class business class on its Airbus A340-600 planes.

The plane

Virgin Atlantic flies daily between Sydney and London via Hong Kong, using the stretched long-range Airbus A340-600 aircraft. It's a long plane (the world's longest in current passenger service) and you'll find Upper Class at the very front.

The Upper Class cabin

Virgin Atlantic revolutionised business class when it invented the herringbone layout for its Upper Class. Every seat has direct access to the aisle, which means no more clambering over passengers to get out during the night.

The seat itself folds forwards to turn into a fully flat bed rather than sliding down like most other business class seats.

On the A340-600, the cabin layout is 1-1-1, with A on the left and K on the right. The middle column of seats face left for the first half of the cabin and right for the second half. They're D seats if they face left, and G seats if they face right.

There's also a standup bar at the very back of Upper Class.

The best seats on the plane

6K 7K 9A 10A: if you're travelling solo, the best seats are those that face the wall behind a seat opposite. So in rows 2-7 that's K seats, and in the rest of the cabin it's A seats. With a lavatory ahead of seat 2K, you'll want to be a few rows back if you're in a K seat, and with the bar behind row 17, you'll want to be a few rows forward if you're in an A seat.

4K 8A 11A 12A 14A: on the same principle as before, these seats are slightly less ideal than the previous set.

The worst seats on the plane

1D 2D 2K: these seats are right next to the lavatory in front of 2K, so it'll be noisy and high-traffic.

17A 17K: these seats are immediately in front of the bar and two lavatories. The bar is popular and sometimes noisy, so best to sit further forward for when you want to sleep.

Rows 15 and 16: the bar can get loud enough that the noise carries this far forwards. Sit further ahead in the cabin instead.

Rows 1-4: with a galley kitchen and lavatory at the front of the cabin, noise is likely to be greater here.

Lufthansa announced the order in March, along with an order for five Boeing 777s, adding up to a total of $4 billion at list prices, as part of an ongoing ""modernisation and expansion"" scheme.

Airbus says the Neo, a popular medium-haul workhorse, burns 15 percent less fuel than the standard A320 -- a crucial factor for airlines at a time of high oil prices.

Floating container castles and flying sea giants

Mechanical engineering student Julia Moser is currently doing an internship at Airbus in Hamburg. Her host company and the port never cease to amaze her: everything is a bit bigger and different to everywhere else…

Julia Moser

Sometimes, the indescribable smell of the sea lingers in the air, which I love. But the North and Baltic Seas are an hour’s drive from Hamburg. Contrary to what many people think, the harbour city is not by the sea. And there is only a grain of truth to the rumour that it’s always raining in Hamburg. Admittedly, the weather can change in the blink of an eye, but that’s all part of the backdrop to the North German city, in front of which a spectacle unfolds 362 days a year that has become just as much a part of everyday life for the citizens of Hamburg as the fickle weather: the container ships drifting serenely into the harbour to load and unload their wares. What was once a trading centre for herrings, beer and timber over 800 years ago has blossomed into a major international transport hub today. Every day, around thirty ships call at Hamburg, over half of which are container ships. The imposing harbour cranes can be seen for miles around and dominate the skyline.

Commuting across the River Elbe

The ferries (linked to the public transport network and referred to affectionately as “Irons” by the locals; see picture) look tiny next to the container giants, which are as big as a house. But they are a popular means of transport. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, a container ship sails past so close you can almost reach out and touch it – not a bad alternative to a touristy harbour tour, which is not cheap.

I take the ferry to work in the morning, which carries me the 600 metres across the River Elbe to Finkenwerder, where Airbus is located, in eight minutes. Airbus has its own ferry terminal, where I get off. As my office is nearby, I walk instead of taking one of the three internal Airbus bus services that run regularly between the various hangars and buildings.

Three lives in quick time

I’ve been doing an industrial internship in the “Structural Test A350XWB” sector for ten weeks now. The maiden flight of the A350XWB, a long-range aircraft that can hold 250 to 350 passengers, is scheduled for 2012. But before the big bird is allowed to fly the nest, it has to pass the structural test, which comprises five individual tests: a wing test, a test for each of the front, middle and rear sections of the fuselage, and a static test where the whole aircraft is put through its paces. The specimens are clamped into a test frame and take-offs, landings, gusts of wind and other stress situations simulated in the space of a few seconds with the aid of hydraulic cylinders.

An aircraft’s life is thus simulated in quick time in the space of a few months. The Airbus machines are even tested for three or more aircraft lives. The idea is to check whether the aircraft displays any signs of structural damage and, if so, take the necessary precautions.

The tests for the A350XWB haven’t got underway yet. There is still a lot of preparation to be done first. For instance, with my (modest) help my internship supervisor needs to make sure that the test frame ultimately fits the aircraft exactly. Airbus does not perform the test itself. Instead, it calls in an external company, which needs to know the exact mass of the aircraft parts to be fixed to the frame.

As we’re in contact with the test institute, suppliers and our colleagues in Toulouse and England, I’m gaining a broad insight into the company and the whole aircraft, which makes the internship very interesting. What I also appreciate is the good supervision and the exchange with the other forty-nine interns from different fields, most of whom I got to know at the induction day back in April.

Division of labour in half of Europe

Airbus grew out of various European companies and the production of the aircraft is shared among the different locations: the English build the wings, Germany and France share the fuselage, the side engines come from Germany and the elevator units from Spain; the propulsion units, landing gear and cabin interior come from international suppliers. And the end lines where an aircraft is completed are also shared among the different locations. The end lines for the A318, A319 and A321 are located in Hamburg, and every month around twenty machines pass through the production halls (assembly, furnishing, painting) before they are delivered to customers.

The A380, however, is put together in Toulouse. Shortly afterwards, you see a somewhat strange-looking machine in the skies over Hamburg: the almost finished A380, which, with its greenish-brown base colour, looks a bit ugly; all it needs now is a lick of paint.

The Beluga transporters keep turning heads, too. They fly into Finkenwerder on a daily basis, bringing aircraft parts to Hamburg from other Airbus locations or vice-versa. The five machines, which are shaped like the beluga whale, were designed exclusively for internal Airbus transport. Even though Hamburg isn’t by the sea, the city still gets to see one of the ocean giants.

American Airlines To Make Largest Aircraft Order In Aviation History - AvStop Aviation News,"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHA6Ly9hdnN0b3AuY29tL25ld3NfanVseV8yMDExL2FtZXJpY2FuX2FpcmxpbmVzX3RvX21ha2VfbGFyZ2VzdF9haXJjcmFmdF9vcmRlcl9pbl9hdmlhdGlvbl9oaXN0b3J5Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines' current fleet of more than 600 Boeing airplanes includes 156 Next-Generation 737-800s delivered to date. The agreement builds on American Airlines' existing backlog of 64 Boeing airplanes consisting of 51 737-800s, seven 777-200ERs (extended range) and six 777-300ERs. In addition, American Airlines has an existing purchase agreement with Boeing to acquire an initial 42 787-9 Dreamliners, with the right to purchase up to 58 additional 787s. ""American Airlines is an industry leader whose vision and disciplined approach to growth has made it one of the largest airlines in the world,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Jim Albaugh. ""This agreement will provide American Airlines with the most capable airplanes in the narrowbody marketplace and continue to deliver industry leading economics. Demand for the 737 remains very strong from customers around the world and we have deliberately retained delivery positions to meet the fleet requirements for all our valued customers."" The deal between Airbus and American was announced on Wednesday at the airline?s Dallas/Ft. Worth hub. The airline plans to announce its choice of engines to power the aircraft at a later date. ?We are pleased to add the Airbus single-aisle family as an important component of our fleet modernization strategy,? said AMR and American Airlines President Tom Horton. ?The A320 Family of aircraft will help us achieve improved fuel efficiency and other operational savings, while offering our customers state-of-the-art technology and an enhanced travel experience. We look forward to a successful partnership with Airbus.? ?We are extremely proud and gratified once again to count American Airlines among Airbus? global customers,? said Airbus President and CEO Tom Enders. ?The order by American represents a strong endorsement of our constantly improving single-aisle product line. All of us at Airbus look forward to seeing the American Airlines livery on A320 Family aircraft ? and we look forward to fulfilling our commitment to providing the people of American, as well as their passengers, with the highest level of support and service in the industry.? The A320neo, launched in late 2010, is the latest product innovation at Airbus. These new A319, A320 and A321 models feature a choice of two new engines ? the PurePower PW1100G from Pratt & Whitney or the LEAP-X from CFM International. Together, the Sharklets and new engine choices result in a 15 percent fuel burn reduction, corresponding to an annual carbon dioxide reduction of 3,600 metric tons per aircraft."
