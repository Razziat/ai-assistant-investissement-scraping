LVMH Move on Repossi Reveals Influence of Delphine Arnault (Published 2015) - The New York Times,"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvMzAvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLW1vdmUtb24tcmVwb3NzaS1yZXZlYWxzLWluZmx1ZW5jZS1vZi1kZWxwaGluZS1hcm5hdWx0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a move that further underscores its new approach to acquiring luxury brands, as well as the rising influence of Delphine Arnault and the growing importance of the fine jewelry sector, LVMH has taken a minority stake in the Italian jeweler Repossi.

This marks the third minority stake the luxury behemoth has ever taken in a brand, with all three coming only in the last two years (the first was in Jonathan Anderson in 2013, when they hired the British designer to head its Spanish luxury brand, Loewe, followed in 2014 a stake in the Italian designer Marco de Vincenzo. It is also LVMH’s first minority stake in a jewelry brand, as well as its first investment in a jewelry brand since the acquisition of Bulgari in 2011 (and its sixth in an Italian family-owned brand after Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana, Berluti and Bulgari).

In a news release, Ms. Arnault, executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and an LVMH director, said: “LVMH is delighted to support the development of Repossi. We share common values which based on product excellence and outstanding creativity. Repossi’s success shows a promising future with which we are pleased to be associated.” It also described the acquisition as a partnership.

Though not a new brand (it was founded in 1920), Repossi is run by Gaia Repossi, the young and well-connected artistic and creative director and a fourth-generation family member. She has reinvented the house as a cooler fine jewelry brand (for example, she has collaborated with Alexander Wang) and become its mediagenic face. The investment thus continues the recent LVMH moves to back new talent like Mr. Anderson and Nicholas Kirkwood, the British shoe label, which LVMH bought in 2013.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9525859355926514}",neutral,0.9525859355926514,0
LVMH Takes Minority Stake in Jeweler Repossi - WWD,"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbWlub3JpdHktc3Rha2UtamV3ZWxlci1yZXBvc3NpLTEwMjg2NjM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Gaia Repossi is taking her relationship with LVMH to the next level, WWD has learned.

Repossi, the Italian jewelry brand she heads as creative director, will announce today that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has taken a minority stake in its capital to help support its future growth.

The 29-year-old designer has long been a front-row fixture at the catwalk shows of LVMH-owned brands including Dior and Fendi and has developed a personal relationship with Delphine Arnault, instrumental in forging the alliance with the luxury conglomerate. Arnault is a board member of LVMH and second-in-command at Vuitton.

Repossi said that the acquisition would allow the family-owned firm to increase brand awareness and expand its retail network in key locations.

But she stressed that she wanted to grow slowly in order to maintain the niche feel of the brand, known for creations including the best-selling Berbère multiband rings and ear cuffs, worn by celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, Emma Stone and Keira Knightley.

“When you face a certain success and production increases, you have to embrace that demand, but to a degree that is realistic and allows a progressive expansion,” Repossi told WWD.

“The idea is to follow a strategy that has this very organic growth, and for that I’m very excited and pleased to share it with LVMH and Delphine herself, because for me, the group has the best knowledge and experience in this category,” she added.

Arnault said LVMH was happy to share its management know-how and help Repossi accelerate its retail expansion.

“We share with this family-owned company the same DNA based on the excellent quality and creativity of its collections and products. The customer response to Repossi promises a bright future for this brand, which we are now happy to be a part of,” she said in a statement.

While neither party was willing to disclose financial details, Repossi described LVMH’s stake as “a substantial minority.” She added that it was “too soon to say” if the jeweler would ever consider selling a majority stake in its capital.

Repossi is to stay on as creative director, a post she has occupied since 2007, and member of the board of the jeweler, while her father Alberto Repossi, grandson of the company’s founder, remains honorary president.

The company expects to name a chief executive officer in the next few months, though Repossi said she would be involved in key decisions.

“It’s still a family brand and it’s still our name, so it’s bigger than just being involved in the collections and the creative,” she explained. “It’s something I would not give away, and the group is absolutely not either in that dynamic, because they want the same eye to be there.”

The acquisition reflects the growing attraction of the jewelry category, which is set to be the strongest-performing segment in personal luxury goods this year with a forecast growth of 6 percent at constant exchange rates, according to the latest estimates by Bain & Co. and Italian association Fondazione Altagamma.

“It’s a market that is developing in a very unexpected way,” Repossi acknowledged, adding that LVMH’s backing would allow the brand to increase its visibility and become more established in the face of growing competition.

Repossi will join an LVMH jewelry stable dominated by Italian behemoth Bulgari, alongside Chaumet, Fred and De Beers Diamond Jewellers. But the firm does not expect to benefit from any synergies.

“The way the group works is they really like to have each house independent, and let them create their own environment, their own production. So for the moment, the idea is to change the least possible what the house has been doing,” Repossi said.

Founded 90 years ago in Turin, Repossi produces most of its pieces in its historic workshops in Italy. Some one-of-a-kind pieces and prototypes are made in Paris.

The brand is sold in 90 points of sale worldwide, including Le Bon Marché and Colette in Paris; Barneys New York in U.S. cities including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco; Tsum in Moscow; Harrods, Selfridges, Browns and Dover Street Market in London; Isetan in Tokyo and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong.

Repossi has two historic flagship stores, located in Monte Carlo and Paris. Its boutique on Place Vendôme is under renovation and the new store design by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, to be unveiled in the first quarter of 2016, will serve as the template for future stores and corners worldwide.

The store design is expected to reflect the pricing structure of the brand, which offers entry-level pieces such as its Antifer collection, beginning at 600 euros, or around $638 at current exchange; fine jewelry, such as the Berbère collection, between 10,000 euros and 200,000 euros, or $10,640 and $212,800, and one-of-a-kind pieces, with prices that can rise to 1.5 million euros, or $1.6 million.

Repossi suggested the alliance with LVMH would boost her creativity, by allowing her to work with fine art photographers, for example. “I like to open up in all sorts of directions, so obviously, there’s going to be some surprises,” she teased.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8939037322998047}",positive,0.8939037322998047,1
LVMH to Take Stake in Repossi | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtdGFrZXMtc3Rha2UtaW4tcmVwb3NzaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH will take a minority stake in Italian fine jewellery brand Repossi, the French luxury conglomerate announced today.

""LVMH is delighted to support the development of Repossi,"" said Delphine Arnault, executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and director of LVMH. ""We share common values, which [are] based on product excellence and outstanding creativity. Repossi's success shows a promising future with which we are pleased to be associated.""

""I am very pleased to have the LVMH group's support and unparalleled experience in the world of high quality crafted products. Its support will be important for us to pursue our strategy and develop our distribution network,"" said Gaia Repossi, artistic and creative director of Repossi.

Founded in Turin, Italy, in 1920 by Constantino Repossi, the brand now operates retail stores in Paris and Monte Carlo. Gaia Repossi, the great-granddaughter of the company’s founder, took the reins as artistic and creative director in 2007 at the age of 21.

Under Gaia Repossi's leadership, Repossi has emerged as an important player in the market for fashion-led fine jewellery. The brand first achieved global recognition for its Berbère collection of minimalist rings and ear cuffs, launched in 2011, which has been worn on the red carpet by the likes of Emma Stone and Diane Kruger.

The move comes in the wake of recent investments in fine jewellery brands by major luxury conglomerates. In 2013, Kering took a majority stake in Italian jeweller Pomellato. Meanwhile Richemont — which already owned Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier — launched a new fine jewellery brand Giampiero Bodino. With its stake in Repossi, LVMH adds to a portfolio that includes De Beers and Bulgari, which the group bought for $5.2 billion in 2011.

Traditionally, branded jewellery has made up only a small fraction of the total market for fine jewellery, which was valued at $263 billion in 2013, according to global consulting firm McKinsey.

Starting in the 1990s and early 2000s, major luxury fashion houses including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Dior launched — or revived — their own branded fine jewellery ranges. Hermès launched its first high-jewellery collection in 2010. In 2014, Maison Martin Margiela, owned by Only The Brave (OTB) group, did the same.

Still, in 2013, only 20 percent of fine jewellery sales were branded, with the 10 biggest jewellery groups capturing a mere 12 percent of the market, leaving a sizeable opportunity for branded players to revolutionise the sector and capture market share from generic retailers and small-time traders. According to McKinsey, branded jewellery will comprise 30 to 40 percent of the fine jewellery market by 2020.

LVMH implements €5 million+ internal carbon fund in environmental drive - CosmeticsDesign-Europe.com,"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21ldGljc2Rlc2lnbi1ldXJvcGUuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMjAxNS8xMS8yMC9MVk1ILWltcGxlbWVudHMtNS1taWxsaW9uLWludGVybmFsLWNhcmJvbi1mdW5kLWluLWVudmlyb25tZW50YWwtZHJpdmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The fund will be financed by contributions from each of the French firm’s sectors, or ‘Maisons’, calculated using the greenhouse gas emissions generated by their activities, specifically in terms of energy consumption in their production sites and stores.

According to Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, many of the materials used in the company’s perfumes and cosmetics, as well as other houses such as fashion, and leather goods and jewellery, are all provided by nature and the topic is of central importance to LVMH.

“Environmental performance has been integrated into the growth strategy of all our Maisons in the same way as quality, innovation and creativity,”​ he says.

“Today respect for the environment is not only an imperative, it is also a lever that drives progress.”​

Carbon fund​

Examples of the projects that will be financed by the fund are investments in energy consumption reduction equipment (LED and cooling equipment) and the production of renewable energy on an international scale.

Each of LVMH’s Maisons, comprising of Perfume & Cosmetics, Wines & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Watches & Jewelry, and Selective Retailing, will each contribute €15 per tonne which is standard current practice.

The carbon fund will take effect in 2016, and this price will be reviewed each year.

The company says that this initiative is an additional step in the implementation of the LVMH Initiatives For the Environment (LIFE) programme which the Group created in 2013 in order to integrate the environment into the management processes of each Maison.

It also states that it fits within all of the Group’s activities in relation to COP21, with which LVMH is one of the partners.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999929666519165}",neutral,0.9999929666519165,0
Repossi Plans Expansion After LVMH Investment - Daily Front Row,"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbndlZWtkYWlseS5jb20vcmVwb3NzaS1wbGFucy1leHBhbnNpb24tbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big plans are in the works for Italian jewelry label Repossi thanks to a recent minority investment by LVMH. The luxury conglomerate has only taken two minority investments in brands in the past, including British designer Jonathan Anderson in 2013 (who also serves as creative director for LVMH-owned Spanish brand Loewe), and Italian designer Marco de Vincenzo. LVMH also bought 35-year-old British shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood’s label in 2013. Repossi’s acquisition further illustrates LVMH’s desire to invest in new talent, much of that with Delphine Arnault at the helm, an LVMH director, the EVP of Louis Vuitton, and CEO Bernard Arnault’s daughter. And while Repossi is not a new brand (est. 1920), it’s certainly entering a new era under the direction of new blood.

Gaia Repossi, 29, the brand’s creative director and fourth-generation family member involved in the company, has had a personal relationship with Delphine, and the connection seems to have paid off. Repossi plans to expand its retail locations and brand awareness thanks to the new investment. “LVMH is delighted to support the development of Repossi,” said Delphine Arnault in a press statement. “We share common values, which is based on product excellence and outstanding creativity. Repossi’s success shows a promising future with which we are pleased to be associated.” This is LVMH’s first minority stake in a jewelry brand and its first investment in a jewelry company since it acquired Bulgari in 2011.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992715716362}",neutral,0.9992715716362,0

It may have been a potent blend of jet-lag (the 28-odd hour journey from Auckland to Bermuda two days before included four layovers) and humidity, but the surroundings play out like a dreamy scene from some turn-of-the-century tale such as Out of Africa.

Bermuda’s colonial roots are proudly displayed in the bar’s interior, made to look like a gentleman’s club complete with Persian rugs, paintings of cricket players in cable knit vests, a blue marble bar serving lager on tap and ceiling fans rotating at a glacial pace. White muslin curtains flutter in the Caribbean breeze to a soundtrack of jazz, and palm trees sway in the distance.

A sobering cup of Bermudian black coffee snaps me out of my trance. In 10 minutes I will be meeting Michael Burke, Chairman and CEO of the world’s most prolific luxury brand, Louis Vuitton. I’m told he rarely conducts interviews with the press.

When Burke walks into the room he is as understated and elegant as the brand he represents, a white linen shirt tucked into crisp chinos, a pair of Louis Vuitton trainers on his feet. The look effortlessly casual, perfect spectator attire.

Calm, softly-spoken and with an easy air, Burke adds to the languor of the day's mood. There is no bravado or ego. Our discussion is a stimulating mix of breezy humour and intense gravity.

Burke’s relationship with Bernard Arnault, billionaire CEO of the LVMH group, is deep-seated. He joined the Arnault Group from university, and took charge of its real estate operations in the United States. In 1986 he joined the LVMH group as head of Louis Vuitton America where he stayed until 1993.

“I had job offers from L’Oreal and Unilever, and all my friends were like ‘okay, so you’re going to L’Oreal’, because that was the holy grail. There were people from those companies recruiting straight out of campus. The offers came but I didn’t feel anything. I didn’t want to sell soap,” recalls the 58-year-old.

“I went instead to work for Bernard in real estate. He described to me what real estate was all about and how it was building communities and dealing with architects. It’s the same thing as dealing with creative and commercial people.

“There was also the tangible aspect of it, which resonated with me. It sounded appealing — rather than being stuck in an office in the 16th arrondisment in Paris and being marketing director.”

In a time when selling real estate was considered on par with being a car salesman, it was a risk — but one that has since proven worth taking. In 1997, Burke moved to Paris to become deputy CEO of Christian Dior Couture (Worldwide) and then on to Fendi in 2003. Prior to Louis Vuitton he was CEO of Bulgari and he was appointed chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton in December 2012, replacing Spanish businessman Jordi Constans, who resigned after a month in the role for health reasons. Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

Constans had replaced popular chairman and CEO Yves Carcelle, who stepped down that year after a decade overseeing Louis Vuitton; he was pivotal to its growth with the hiring of designer Marc Jacobs. Carcelle passed away in September 2014.

For Burke, it was that risk taking in those earlier years and having faith in what he believed was the right path for him that has put him in good stead ever since.

“Very often I see people make professional decisions based on what their friends think what they should be doing. Why would you do that?”

Never one to conform, he confesses that when it came to his equally charming wife Brigitte (whom I had met at dinner the night before), she was his college sweetheart and he turned down going to Harvard and instead followed her to France where he continued his studies. He also provides more than just the token sound bite.

“My press office would prefer it if I stick to the script and I never do!” Michael laughs. “Nothing is written or scripted; I just speak what I feel.”

It’s the perfect summation from the CEO of a brand that has built so much of its 161-year history on a blend of savoir faire and emotion. That hallmark is ingrained within the brand’s relationship with the America’s Cup event — and the reason we are all in Bermuda.

“The America’s Cup authority has entrusted us for the last 35 years to protect the cup and it’s probably the most valuable and the most desired trophy in the world,” Burke explains. “The one element of the America’s Cup myth, I think, has to do with the fact that is doesn’t belong to anybody.

There is no one federation that controls it, so it is the ultimate travelling trophy. There is a deed of trust which goes back to the mid-19th century that guides what happens to the trophy. Effectively the winner becomes the steward of it for a short period of time, making it unique.”

The day before, at the Cup Village, Burke had presented the official Louis Vuitton trunk, custom-made by the brand’s bespoke ateliers in Asnieres, on the northwestern outskirts of Paris.

Flanked by a crew member from each of the six sailing teams that had competed over the weekend as part of the third Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series, along with Team Oracle USA’s owner Larry Ellison, Burke reinforced the company’s passion for sailing, highlighting its unique place in the world of competitive sports.

In a weekend that saw Emirates Team New Zealand sail into the third challenger series at the top of the table and Les Tricolores suffer a crushing defeat against the All Blacks in the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup, I was feeling particularly patriotic. Burke laughs.

“Don’t talk about rugby today. That was a blowout, the biggest in 109 years!” (New Zealand and France first played in 1906.)

Like the Rugby World Cup last month and the Fifa World Cup last year, Louis Vuitton’s involvement in creating trunks to carry these trophies is an extension of its relationship with the sporting world, a world Burke believes is an important component in engaging the changing face of today’s luxury consumer market.

“Sociologically speaking, there are four movements going on right now and they all intersect. These are fashion, sport, music and design. Because of the digital age, everybody is instantaneously engaged and that allows these four to interact in a much more fast-paced, organic manner. Much like in the 20s and 60s there were key moments when artists did engage with designers, but that was at a totally different pace and the interaction was not as ingrained.

“Today, when we do a fashion show there is art, music, design and fashion and that is what it is all about now. When they successfully intersect you create engagement — which is what we’re in the business of. For us, it’s extremely important to see how audiences engage with all four movements simultaneously.”

The coming together of design and sports is a relationship Burke is proud of. From the technical uniforms worn by the sailors to the impressive technology that goes into the design and production of each boat (we were taken on a private tour of Team Oracle’s headquarters the day before) it is easy to see how these worlds collided.

“If you are too steeped in the past you will die, worthy of a museum.” says Burke. “You’re not a living thing anymore and, therefore, not a living brand anymore. If you are just about technology and just about the future, you will become irrelevant very quickly, because somebody else will come along and outdo you with the next leap of technology. It is the junction and the journey of those two that defines the present.”

I think of my own journey to Bermuda and why we are here. Other than a mention in the Beach Boys classic Kokomo (“Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama”), Bermuda shorts and the mystique that is the Bermuda Triangle, my knowledge of the fish hook-shaped British Island territory was pitiful.

“You’ve really got to discover Bermuda from all angles, it’s a very complex 20 miles,” says Burke. “See it from the sea, land, bicycling, windsurfing and the air. It’s one of the most extraordinary places to dive as there’s about 500 years of shipwrecks to discover. That’s quite an immense feeling. Discover the old towns like St George’s, the oldest continuously-inhabited English town in the New World and of course the old naval yard. Everyone should see that part of history.”

Halfway through our interview we are interrupted by an unassuming man, who on a closer look, is Louis Vuitton’s menswear artistic director Kim Jones wearing a Hawaiian shirt. As the two casually chit chat, I resist the urge to run over like some fawning fan and tell him how I’ve long admired his work.

“I’ll text you later,” Jones says to Burke as he leaves, with the same natural ease one has when talking to a close friend or family member. Burke returns and picks up where we left off. “My relationship with Kim is very special. As with Nicolas Ghesquiere, the house needs to work on balancing the past with the present so the innovation the designers represent is always in keeping with our heritage. When a designer joins a historic house like Louis Vuitton, the designer will need to evolve, and when that happens, the house will evolve.

“The designer cannot come and believe they will shape the house to their liking. You’re dancing with history. It’s a pas de deux and the designer and the house have to evolve and they will write a new score together.”

Jones’ nomadic childhood saw the young Londoner travel with his family (his father was a successful hydro-geologist) through Africa and the Caribbean. So he is the perfect person to understand Louis Vuitton’s travel legacy, eventually filtering that influence through subsequent collections for the house and its campaigns (the current campaign is shot in Jaipur, India).

To mark the brand’s relationship with the America’s Cup a special edition men’s Cup Collection, designed by Jones, will launch in April 2016.

“If we were just a regular sponsor, it wouldn’t resonate with our clients and press,” says Burke. “It’s by talking with Russell Coutts and discussing how this was all going to unfold in Bermuda over the next two years. If it wasn’t for great product that you can purchase and wear, it wouldn’t be as deep as an engagement with this sport.”

The capsule range combines Jones’ love of sportswear with luxury, and consists of backpacks adorned with the specially designed Louis Vuitton Cup America’s Cup victory logo, lightweight shorts and slip-on trainers.

“What we want to offer is how you can dress elegantly strolling down a street in Hamilton (Bermuda’s capital). It used to be there wasn’t much difference between what the public and the sailors were wearing. Look at them today. You’re not going to go to a barbecue dressed like that. But how do you dress as a spectator? That’s what we want to bring to the party.”

With Bermuda scheduled in the Louis Vuitton itinerary for at least two more years, you can expect even more from the well-travelled house. Just last May, Vuitton supported the 12th Havana Biennale in Cuba along with a riotous Cruise showing at Bob Hope’s futuristic home in Palm Springs.

“It was an interesting time for people to discover the history of Palm Springs, the music, mid-century architecture, the progressive design of John Lautner and the myth of the LA dream.” Burke reveals that the next Cruise collection will showcase in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, next May, three months before the Olympic Games begin.

“It’s going to be a discovery and journey into a different culture once again. Oscar Niemeyer is one of the most forward-thinking architects and the modernism that flourished in the 20th century in Brazil was unique, a real contributor to modernism for the 20th century, not in a passeiste way, but looking forward.”

Looking forward has always been a part of the Louis Vuitton oeuvre. You only have to look at the recent Spring/Summer 2016 collection from Paris Fashion Week as an example of that ideal fully realised. Ghesquiere made a futuristic journey to the digital frontier, set to a thumping soundtrack of German electronica as models explored the runway like characters from Tron Legacy. Perhaps it's the house saying ""next stop: time travel"". It's an innovative concept, but you can't help thinking a radical leap into time is a challenge the brand would embrace wholeheartedly.

""Victory travels in Louis Vuitton,"" recounts Burke from his presentation speech the day before. ""Just look at the America's Cup. It may sound corny, but when you dig down deep you see that one reason for eternity is that we all try to achieve it.

""Vuitton has achieved a certain amount of eternity, just like the Cup has, and whatever the challenge to achieve that, you know the journey will be worth it.""



CHIT CHAT WITH MICHAEL

How I relax:

""I have five kids and they help get your mind off the daily humdrum. I also like to play golf and fix things. Today's world is so digitalised you lose connection with the tangible world, so I enjoy fixing things in the house. When you're doing that you're not thinking about your job and you're totally unwinding. It's a different type of meditation.

I also like to make things out of wood, particularly toys for my kids. It really relaxes you. There’s something about wood, the graining, the scent, the texture. The beginnings of Louis Vuitton are with wood and he came from Jura region, where all these forests are. It’s where he developed his love of wood, especially poplar, and is the basis of the classic Louis Vuitton trunk.

Last book I read:

""Psychologie des Foules by Gustave Le Bon (1895). It explores the nature of crowds and I found it very interesting and still applicable today. It's great for running a business. How do you get a crowd behind you? A crowd can turn left or right depending on the leader and the leader has an influence on what crowds do. I love reading old books became the English was much different — things were often written in much simpler terms.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999953508377075}",neutral,0.9999953508377075,0
Swiss Tag Heuer teams up with big tech for luxury smartwatch - DAWN.com,"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTIxODc0MdIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzEyMTg3NDE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ZURICH: LVMH's Tag Heuer became on Monday the first Swiss watchmaker to offer a ""smartwatch"" to customers that combines Swiss design with American technology, seeking to tap a growing market for wearable devices amid flagging sales of traditional watches.

Co-developed with Google and Intel, the ""Tag Heuer Connected"" will cost $1,500.

One thousand units are immediately available in 15 stores across the United States (US), with Britain, Germany, and Japan following in the coming days.

With its titanium casing, black rubber strap and digital watch hands, it is designed to look like a classical watch.

But Connected houses an Intel Atom processor beneath its touchscreen that lets wearers connect to the internet, stream music and run applications via Google's Android Wear platform, from existing favourites such as Google Fit and Google Maps to customised lifestyle and sports apps designed for the watch.

Customers can also swap their smartwatch for a mechanical watch at the end of the two-year warranty period if they pay another $1,500, encouraging what the traditional industry hopes will be a trend among young smartwatch wearers to buy ""real"" timepieces as they mature.

""We are going after new customers ... once they have bought a connected watch, they are ready to buy another watch one day,"" Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver told Reuters, adding the similar looks of the new connected watch and other Tag Heuer models would make the transition easier.

Asked about potential sales of the new product, he said: ""I don't really know ... I only have the gut feeling that we're just at the beginning, and that the first (connected) watches are like the first phones we had twenty years ago.""

Makers of traditional Swiss watches have largely stayed on the sidelines of the emerging smartwatch market headed by the Apple Watch launched this year, with models ranging from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model.

But the industry needs a boost. Swiss watch exports posted the biggest drop since 2009 in the third quarter, with a 14.5 per cent slip in the 200-500 franc category fuelling concerns the Apple Watch might be taking market share.

Bank Vontobel analysts in October forecast low to mid-market watches would be affected by sales of smartwatches and other wearable devices, and 30-50pc of quartz watches would include some smartwatch features in the long term.

Switzerland's biggest watchmaker, Swatch Group, has some connected products at its Swatch and Tissot brands, but has rejected making a ""telephone"" or ""computer for the wrist"", as Chief Executive Nick Hayek told a paper in August.

Swatch has also eschewed big tech partnerships, which Biver said were needed to launch a smartwatch such as Connected.

""If you want to offer a smartwatch as sophisticated and complete as the Apple Watch, that is practically impossible for a Swiss company alone,"" Biver said. ""We cannot develop microprocessors to that level.""

""Many Swiss watch brands are not keen on partnerships. We were keen because I believed that my price range could be hit by the competition of smartwatches,"" he said.

The Tag Heuer Connected is, at least initially, being produced at Intel manufacturing sites. It comes without the coveted ""Swiss Made"" tag, but with the label ""Intel Inside"" and ""Swiss Engineered"" on the watch case.

The partnership with Intel and Google was announced in March. Biver said the partners shared development costs, but gave no details.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996286630630493}",neutral,0.9996286630630493,0
