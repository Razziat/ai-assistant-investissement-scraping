"eBay, LVMH settle lengthy lawsuit over fake goods - CNET","Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvc2VydmljZXMtYW5kLXNvZnR3YXJlL2ViYXktc2V0dGxlcy1sZW5ndGh5LWxhd3N1aXQtd2l0aC1sdm1oLW92ZXItY291bnRlcmZlaXQtZ29vZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"eBay and French luxury goods maker LVMH have finally settled a longstanding legal feud over the issue of fake products that pop up on the online site.

In a lawsuit launched in 2008, LVMH complained about the practice of fake knockoffs of its products appearing on eBay's site, charging that eBay didn't do enough to clamp down on the sale of such items. After several years of fines and appeals, the two sides have finally agreed to work together to better protect intellectual property rights and fight back against the sale of phony goods.

""eBay and LVMH today announced a cooperative effort to protect intellectual property rights and combat counterfeits in online commerce,"" the two companies said in a joint statement released on Thursday. ""Thanks to the cooperation measures put in place, the companies have settled ongoing litigation.""

Companies such as LVMH, Tiffany & Co, and L'Oreal have long contended that eBay maintains a lax attitude toward the listing and sale of counterfeit products on its website. In its defense, eBay has insisted that it spends a great deal of time and money trying to clamp down on the sale of counterfeit items. Either way, eBay has certainly spent enough time and money in court trying to defend itself against the host of lawsuits from certain retailers. So the latest agreement will at least spare eBay further legal trouble from one of Europe's largest fashion conglomerates.

No specific details of the settlement were revealed, nor did the companies explain how they plan to work together. Both companies touted the agreement as something in the best interests of the consumer as per the following joint statement from Michael Jacobson, senior vice president and general counsel at eBay, and Pierre Godé, vice president at LVMH:

""Thanks to our joint efforts, consumers will enjoy a safer digital environment globally.""

LVMH is the European powerhouse behind a variety of premium-brand products, including Louis Vuitton fashion goods, Dior perfumes and cosmetics, and TAG Heuer watches and jewelry. The company's 2008 lawsuit against eBay not only complained of the sale of fake goods but also charged that the sale of legitimate products through eBay harmed its own sales, according to Reuters.

Since then, the two sides had been duking it out in court. In 2008, a French court ordered eBay to pay LVMH 38.6 million euros (at the time around $61 million). An appeals court lowered the fine to $2.5 million, though eBay still balked at the amount and the overall charges. In 2010, a Paris court ruled against eBay in yet another lawsuit that charged the company with using keywords on its site that hurt the Louis Vuitton brand."

No further details were available about what these measures entail. Six brands under the LVMH umbrella including Dior and Givenchy, filed complaints against eBay in 2006 and two years later, a French court slapped a 38.5 million euro ($52.1 million) fine on the site. The luxury giant accused eBay of allowing people to trade fake goods causing damage to the brands involved.

"Power Moves | Sass & Bide Founders Exit, Kors Taps Brashear to Lead Men's, LVMH Exec Joins Apple - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd29ya3BsYWNlLXRhbGVudC9wb3dlci1tb3Zlcy1zYXNzLWJpZGUtZm91bmRlcnMtZXhpdC1rb3JzLXRhcHMtYnJhc2hlYXItbGVhZC1tZW5zLWx2bWgtZXhlYy1qb2lucy1hcHBsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom – BoF compiles the most important professional moves of the week.

Sass & Bide Founders Depart Label

Sass & Bide founders Sarah-Jane Clarke and Heidi Middleton are leaving their Australian-based fashion label after 15 years at the helm. The news was confirmed by Australian department store Myer, who purchased a 65 percent share in the fashion label in 2011. The company has appointed Anthony Cuthbertson as design director, who has consulted for Victoria Beckham and Mulberry, and previously worked for David Lawrence, Ralph Lauren, MaxMara and Joseph. Clarke and Middleton launched their label with a stall on Portobello Market in London, before expanding and showcasing their collections during London and New York fashion weeks.

Michael Kors Taps Mark Brashear

Luxury lifestyle brand Michael Kors has appointed Mark Brashear to the newly created role of global menswear president, effective immediately. Brashear, who resigned last month as chairman and president of Hugo Boss Americas, will report to John D. Idol, Michael Kors' chairman and chief executive officer. Brashear's appointment is a key element in the strategic development of the brand's men's business, which will include the rollout of freestanding men's stores starting next year as well as the debut of new categories, as Kors aims to build a $1 billion men's brand. Prior to his five-year tenure at Hugo Boss, Brashear was president of Façonnable until 2008 and executive vice president at Nordstrom until 2001.

Apple Hires LVMH Exec

Less than a year after Apple announced the appointment of former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts, the company has hired Patrick Pruniaux, vice president of sales at LVMH-owned luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer. This makes the third executive that Apple has plucked from the luxury sector, after Yves Saint Laurent's CEO Paul Deneve was taken on board last year to work on special projects. Pruniaux will join the Silicon Valley-based company in an unspecified role, although it is believed he will bring his timepiece expertise to the iWatch, which could debut this autumn.

Karstadt CEO Resigns

Eva-Lotta Sjöstedt, the chief executive of German retailer Karstadt, has stepped down after just six months. Karstadt, which operates 83 stores across Germany, named Sjöstedt as CEO in February to help the company return to profitability. ""This step came as a surprise to us and at a very difficult time for Karstadt,"" said chairman Stephan Fanderl. The struggling department store chain filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, but was rescued by billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen. Chief financial officer Miguel Müllenbach and chief human resources officer Kai-Uwe Weitz will now lead Karstadt until a replacement has been found.

Valérie Hermann Steps Down From Moncler

Valérie Hermann, recently tapped as president of Ralph Lauren Luxury Collections, has stepped down from her position as an independent director of Moncler SpA, a role she has held since December 2013. Hermann also resigned as a member of both Moncler's control and risks committee and nomination and remuneration committee. Gabriele Galateri di Genola will take over as chairman of the control and risks committee. Prior to joining Moncler, Hermann was chief executive of Reed Krakoff, and formerly, Yves Saint Laurent. She has also worked at various capacities at LVMH, including director of women's ready-to-wear at Dior.

LVMH has a “cognac situation” in China—and it's dragging on sales - Quartz,"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIzOTk5MS9sdm1ocy1jb2duYWMtc2l0dWF0aW9uLWluLWNoaW5hLXdlaWdocy1vbi1yZXN1bHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The numbers: Frail. During the first half, profits from recurring operations fell 5% at the parent of fashion labels including Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Celine, and Givenchy and spirit brands such as Moët & Chandon and Hennessy. Sales climbed a modest 2.7% to €14 billion ($18.9 billion).

The takeaway: Unfavorable exchange rates took a €235-million bite out of LVMH’s bottom line, thanks to a strong euro which has boosted costs of luxury manufacturing in Europe. “The cognac situation in China,” as executives termed it during today’s conference call, also weighed on results. As Quartz has reported, sales of cognac (such as LVMH’s Hennessy) have taken a dive in China, amid an anti-corruption crackdown targeting corporate gifts and shady business dealings that take place at karaoke clubs and bath houses. LVMH’s organic revenue growth in Asia—excluding Japan—decelerated sharply to 3% during the first half of 2014. That’s down from 13% growth during the first half of 2013.

What’s interesting: In October 2013, fashion designer Marc Jacobs stepped down as creative director at LVMH’s flagship fashion house, Louis Vuitton, to focus on his eponymous brand, in which LVMH holds a majority stake. Chairman and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault confirmed plans for an initial public offering for Marc Jacobs last fall. LVMH recently announced the appointment of Sebastian Suhl as CEO at Marc Jacobs. As COO at Prada, Suhl helped see the Italian luxury house through an IPO in 2011. He also ran the brand’s operations in Asia—which presently accounts for well over a third of LVMH sales."
Declining demand from China hurts Louis Vuitton in Q2 - Business - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTQtMDcvMjYvY29udGVudF8xNzkyOTYxNC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A trendy woman takes photos of handbags showcased at a fashion store of Louis Vuitton (LV) in Fuzhou city, Southeast China's Fujian province, April 1, 2014.

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy has seen a drop in demand from Chinese buyers in its home market and overseas, the French fashion, spirits and cosmetics group said on Thursday after posting below-forecast second-quarter sales and profits.

The world's No 1 luxury group said growth in sales from Louis Vuitton, its main cash cow, had dropped in China in the second quarter from the first, while revenues from Chinese tourists declined in major European markets such as France.

It also said fewer tourists, particularly from the Chinese mainland, were shopping in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is where many leading luxury brands generate more than 10 percent of their global revenue.

""After May, we have seen the level of business there slowing down markedly,"" LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts in a conference call, adding that the group's duty-free unit DFS had suffered particularly.

Guiony's comments echoed watch specialist Swatch Group Ltd which voiced concerns on Tuesday about the outlook in Hong Kong in the near term.

Regarding China, Guiony did not provide an explanation other than pointing to a general difficult business climate affected by the government's efforts to crackdown on corruption and conspicuous spending.

Louis Vuitton, the top luxury brand by revenue which generates more than half of LVMH's operating profit, has also been struggling to counter a growing perception among emerging market customers that it has become too ubiquitous.

The brand's sales growth in the second quarter collapsed to zero from 9 percent the previous three months.

Louis Vuitton has been trying to win back customers and regain exclusivity by strengthening its higher-end offering with leather goods and smart designs but its efforts have been taking time to pay off.

""Louis Vuitton has done a lot to innovate its products, but consumers - especially in China - are still not embracing it in full,"" Luca Solca, luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas said.

LVMH's comments contrasted with a more upbeat trading update from rival Burberry Group Plc earlier this month which said it continued to enjoy solid sales growth in China.

UBS AG, which has a buy rating on LVMH shares, said it was going to change its full-year earnings forecasts ""given the much-weaker-than-hoped-for start of the year and the fact that a number of adverse factors will likely weigh for some time, including a slowdown in demand in China"".

LVMH's sales growth in the second quarter reached 3 percent on a like-for-like basis, below analysts' expectations for 5-6 percent, while the group's operating profit in the first half fell to 18 percent from 19.8 percent last year.

Guiony said part of the profitability drop was due to adverse currency movements and the slower sales growth.

LVMH's operating profit from recurring operations reached 2.576 billion euros ($3.47 billion), down 5 percent from the same period a year earlier.

LVMH said trading in Europe was resilient ""despite a still-challenging economic environment"" but sales growth stalled in the second quarter, versus a 1 percent increase in the first quarter.

Revenue growth remained solid in North America but fell 11 percent in Japan, against growth of 32 percent in the first quarter, during which sales were boosted by advanced purchases ahead of a VAT increase on April 1."
Permits Filed: 743 5th Avenue - New York YIMBY,"Wed, 09 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3eW9ya3lpbWJ5LmNvbS8yMDE0LzA3L3Blcm1pdHMtZmlsZWQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1leHBhbmRpbmctYXQtNzQzLTV0aC1hdmVudWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first permits are up for Louis Vuitton’s horizontal expansion to 743 5th Avenue, which will apparently result in the temporary closure of portions of its retail flagship, at 1 East 57th Street. LVMH Moet Hennessey “Luis” Vuitton is listed as the developer.

743 5th Avenue’s floor area will be quite small, totaling 1,580 square feet, but the one-story building will stand 85 feet tall, offering soaring ceilings that would normally befit an eight-story structure.

The New York Observer reported on LVMH’s acquisition of the lot back in 2007, when it sold for $60 million. An original structure spanning 20,000 square feet has already been demolished, paving the way for work to begin on Louis Vuitton’s expansion.

Demolition of the original structure does beg the question of where the “missing” air rights are in the latest permits, given the large reduction in overall square footage. Nearby sites would be unlikely for a residential assemblage, and the value of Fifth Avenue retail in the proposed format will be astronomical, though 18,000 square feet would still fetch an extremely high sum given the site’s address and neighborhood.

No completion date for the expansion has been announced.

LVMH and eBay settle litigation over fake goods - Yahoo News UK,"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2VsZWJyaXR5L2x2bWgtZWJheS1zZXR0bGUtbGl0aWdhdGlvbi1vdmVyLWZha2UtZ29vZHMtMTEwMjU5MzU3LS1maW5hbmNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and eBay Inc have settled a long-running court battle over the sale of counterfeit luxury goods on the U.S. company's online auction website. The companies are implementing cooperative measures aimed at protecting intellectual property rights and fighting the online sale of counterfeit goods. ""Thanks to our joint efforts, consumers will enjoy a safer digital environment globally,"" the companies said in a joint statement, without giving detail on the measures. A host of perfume and cosmetic brands under the LVMH umbrella, including Christian Dior, Givenchy and Geurlain, sued the world's leading online auctioneer in 2008, accusing the site of allowing trade in counterfeit goods. LVMH also claimed that the sale of real perfumes through non-approved distribution channels such as eBay hurt its business. In 2008 a French court ordered eBay to pay LVMH 38.5 million euros (30.4 million pound). A subsequent appeal court reduced the sum to 5.7 million euros but affirmed that eBay had been in the wrong. In 2012 a French appeal court ruled that a lower court did not have jurisdiction over eBay's U.S. website but upheld the ruling as applied to its French and British sites. LVMH shares were down 0.6 percent at 139.15 euros on Thursday morning. (Reporting by Martinne Geller in Paris; Editing by David Goodman)"

The first three stores opened in July in Andalucía, Cataluña and Galicia, including a 300sqm shop in Granada and outlets in Barcelona and Pontevedra. The retailer hopes to finish the year with a total of 112 points of sale in the country, including Sephora stores and Sephora spaces in El Corte Inglés, and aims to double turnover in the next five years.

“One of the strategies of Sephora is to grow in the major cities of Spain, selecting the best locations and taking maximum care of both the image and the product offer of the stores to offer consumers a truly unique and unforgettable beauty experience,” said Francisco Álvarez, Director General of Sephora Spain. “Sephora Spain is one of Europe's best performing markets. The Spanish consumer is a modern woman, who is caring and always looking for innovation. For this reason, our commitment to offer the best selection of beauty meets this demand.”

The French retailer launched in the US in 1999 and Canada in 2003 and this year announced its entry into Australia. The company has been part of LVMH since 1997 and has more than 2.000 points of sale in 57 countries.

French billionaires rise to 67 despite economic crisis - France - RFI English,"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9lY29ub215LzIwMTQwNzEwLWZyZW5jaC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtcmlzZS02Ny1kZXNwaXRlLWVjb25vbWljLWNyaXNpc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France

France’s rich are getting richer, despite the crisis. The country now has 67 billionaires and the richest 500 people are worth a massive 390 billion euros, according to a leading business magazine.

Thomas Piketty, whose best-seller Capital in the 21st Century points to growing inequality across the world, may well be right, comments the far-from-radical French business magazine Challenges.

While the French economy struggled to return to growth and unemployment remained at 10 per cent, the number of billionaires in France grew last year from 55 to 67, Challenges found in its annual look at the country’s wealthiest citizens.

The total assets of the top 500 went up, too – by 15 per cent to 390 billion euros.

The survey includes individuals and families and family businesses, such as Europe’s top supplier of scaffolding and cement-mixers Altrad, whose founder Mohed Altrad is in at number 61 with a billion euros.

The top four in the list are the same as last year and three of them are in luxury goods:

Bernard Arnault of LVMH – 27 billion euros;

Liliane Bettencourt and family of l’Oreal – 26 billion euros;

Gérard Mulliez and family of Auchan – 20 billion euros;

Axel Dumas and family of Hermès and 17 billion euros.

Challenges says that part of the wealth boom is due to central banks’ policies of providing cheap credit in an effort to revive investment.

Much of that money is put into already-existing companies and real estate but the policy has also led to a major rise in mergers and company takeovers.

That in turn has led the profits from sales being invested elsewhere, notably in hotels, according to Challenges, in order to avoid wealth tax, applicable to share income but not to income derived from participating in the management of a company.
