LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Set to Relinquish 23 Percent Stake in Hermès - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtc2V0LXRvLXJlbGlucXVpc2gtbW9zdC1vZi0yMy1zdGFrZS1pbi1oZXJtZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the heels of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault’s statement that he will relinquish most of his 23% holding in Hermès, LVMH has filed a regulatory statement outlining how it will execute the divestment to shareholders. According to the statement, LVMH shareholders will get two Hermès shares for every 41 LVMH shares they own and LVMH will communicate the distribution at least four business days before it takes place. The Hermès shares will be valued at the opening trading price on the day of the payment, not exceeding 235.2 euros a share, valuing the stake at as much as $7.4 billion.

This move will seemingly put an end a long-standing battle between the two luxury rivals (see a timeline of their many legal battles here). According to Reuters, “LVMH is distributing its Hermès stake to shareholders almost four years after it started building the holding without Hermès’s knowledge. The payment, due to be completed by Dec. 20, will leave Groupe Arnault, the family holding company of LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault, with an 8.5 percent interest in Hermès.” More to come …"

Owner LVMH, since April 2014

Global family

LVMH owns Château Cheval Blanc and Château d’Yquem in Bordeaux; several Champagne houses including Dom Pérignon and Krug; Numanthia in Spain; Cloudy Bay in New Zealand; Cape Mentelle in Australia; Newton Vineyard in California; Cheval des Andes and Terrazas de Los Andes in Argentina, and Shangri La in China.

The recent purchase by Bernard Arnault’s Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton group of the 8.84 hectare Domaine des Lambrays gives LVMH not only its first Burgundian vineyard, but also the vast majority of one of Burgundy’s oldest grand cru vineyards, the Clos des Lambrays.

Domaine des Lambrays is a ‘masterpiece’, says CEO and chairman of Moët Hennessy, Christophe Navarre. ‘It represents the perfect expression of the nobility of Burgundy wines,’ he says, citing the ‘unique’ nature of the Clos des Lambrays within Morey-st-Denis, and the ‘delicate character and elegant taste’ of the fruit from the vineyards.

The sale, for ‘around €100m’ (£79.46m) according to domaine director Thierry Brouin, sees Domaine des Lambrays join a fine wine empire that already includes Krug and Dom Pérignon in Champagne and Château d’Yquem and Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux among others.

While the domaine is most famous for the grand cru Clos des Lambrays – 30,000 bottles a year – the purchase also includes 1ha of Morey-St-Denis vines, just over 0.3ha of Morey-St-Denis premier cru, plus Clos du Cailleret in Puligny-Montrachet (0.37 ares, 1ha = 100 ares) and Les Folatières premier cru in puligny-Montrachet (0.29 ares).

A virtual monopoly

Of the Domaine des Lambrays’ 8.84ha, 8.66ha represent planted vines of Clos des Lambrays grand cru – a virtual monopole vineyard except for 0.18ha of vines belonging to neighbour Domaine Taupenot Merme, about 200 bottles. Navarre – who will meet this November with Brouin to assess marketing strategies and price policies – has praised Brouin’s ‘amazing job at the domaine for the past 35 years’, saying he is ‘one of the most respected winemakers in Burgundy’. Navarre doesn’t foresee any specific changes in the near future; indeed, readers might recall that it was more than 15 years before a new cellar was constructed at Cheval Blanc after it was acquired by LVMH and Albert Frère in 1998. ‘The domaine is perfect as it is today, from the size of the domaine to the price of the bottles, and the quality of the infrastructure; we really want to keep the original spirit of Clos des Lambrays,’ Navarre says.

However, Brouin did say that prices could increase. ‘It would not be dramatic,’ he says. ‘For now the 2012 costs €120 [£95.50] per bottle ex-domaine, but this price could come closer to €150 [£119.50],’ he said. ‘I hope it doesn’t go any higher than that.’ Domaine des Lambrays has not always been on top form. When Brouin arrived to manage the estate in 1980, it was in disarray, many vines had not been replanted and entire vintages from the 1970s had not been bottled. The estate had earned the nickname Clos Délabré – a French play on words, as délabré means dilapidated.

Located in Morey-st-Denis in Burgundy’s Côte de Nuits region between Dijon and Beaune, Clos des Lambrays dates back to the 14th century, and was first cited in deeds of Citeaux Abbey in 1365. Like other estates, it was broken up during the French Revolution but was put back together piece by piece by 1868, thanks to the work of négociant owner Louis Joly. Although highly ranked as a ‘première cuvée’ in Dr Jules Lavalle’s influential 19th century book, Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne et des Grands Vins de la Côte d’Or, Brouin explained that Renée Cosson, owner for 40 years from the late 1930s, did not seek grand cru status, to avoid the associated increase in taxes. Although surrounded by grand cru appellations in Morey-St-Denis, Cosson’s neglect of the estate up until 1977 did not help its reputation.

‘She did nothing,’ recalls Brouin, now 66 years old himself. ‘That may have worked in excellent vintages, like 1937 and 1945, but in difficult vintages it was a disaster,’ he said. ‘Because she never replanted anything, disease damaged or killed almost half the vines during the 40-year period of her ownership.’

One of the first things Brouin did when he arrived in 1980 was to distil still unbottled 1973 and 1974 wine into the local brandy, Fine de Bourgogne. Several months later, under the direction of the new owners, Fabien and Louis Saier, he uprooted 2.5ha of disease-ridden vines: well over 25% of the property’s plantings.

Following massive investment in order to modernise and replant the estate, the Saier brothers’ application for grand cru status was approved less than two years later, in April 1981. ‘This is understandable,’ Brouin says. ‘The Clos has one of the most beautiful climates of the Côte de Nuits – and the largest parcel of grand cru vines in the Côte de Nuits belonging to a single owner.’

Turnaround in fortunes

Brouin deserves much credit for turning the property around under the two ownerships since the Cosson era, first the Saier brothers and then German couple, Günter and Ruth Freund. The Freunds purchased the estate for the current equivalent of €15m (£12m) in 1996 and made further investments, including expanding the underground cellar and constructing a beautiful orangery garden. They also declassified young vines up to the age of 25 years.

Brouin explains how the most recent sale came about. Following Günter’s death in 2010, Ruth felt obliged to sell when she reached the age of 80, mainly because neither her son or any of his family had expressed any interest in taking over. ‘It is good that LVMH is stepping in, because the property could have been split up among different owners,’ Brouin adds. ‘That would have been the death of Clos des Lambrays.’

A trio of terroirs

Clos des Lambrays is the steepest of the Morey grand crus, the slope clearly looking over Clos de Tart with its highest point at nearly 370m above sea level and its lowest about 250m. The Clos is made up of three main vineyard areas. Driving next door to Domaine Ponsot, Brouin likes to point out how the undulating nature of the vineyard creates subtle, distinct microclimates: ‘You can see that there are complex exposures even as the slope descends,’ he says.

Each of the three parcels has its own distinct terroir. The first, 1ha of heavier clay and large loam soil at the bottom called Meix Rentier, has a small slice of the vineyard that can be seen from the Route des Grands Crus. The second, Les Larrets, is 5.72ha, and in the mid-slope heart of the vineyard, which Lavalle had ranked ‘première cuvée’ since it has the best exposure to the sun; Brouin says it is the best drained. Finally there is Les Bouchots, 1.99ha, at the top, which brings ‘elegance’ to the wine. Thanks to the proximity of the Combe de Morey dry valley, cool air streams over these vines, Brouin explains.

Among vineyards in the area, Clos des Lambrays contains the highest percentage of rocky, red soil, rich in iron oxide, in the upper part of the vineyard, which could explain the more elegant, cooler blue fruit and mineral-driven expression, compared with the bigger, dark-fruit driven nature of Clos de Tart. That Brouin enjoys picking earlier than all his neighbours certainly lends freshness to the wine.

‘We don’t want to change the way Clos des Lambrays is produced,’ Navarre says, confirming LVHM’s intention to neither change the style nor divide the property. Brouin is to stay on as director for the next three years, plus another two years as consultant for whoever is his successor. ‘We are interested in the continuity of the work of Thierry Brouin and Günter Freund as they both contributed to the strong personality of Clos des Lambrays and we want to keep it like this,’ Navarre says. ‘The domaine is in perfect condition.’

LVMH’s venture into Burgundy may be good news for Morey-St-Denis in general, neighbours say. ‘We have always been in the shadow of Chambolle- Musigny and Gevrey-Chambertin, so this is good for us as LVMH will give us a certain cachet,’ says Taupenot Merme’s Virginie Taupenot Daniel. ‘Due to what they have done at Yquem and Cheval Blanc, LVMH will do great things here,’ she predicts.

CNN —

Luxury enthusiasts, rejoice: Louis Vuitton is bringing its upscale sensibilities to the art world.

Fondation Louis Vuitton, the philanthropic wing of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, is opening a 41,441-square-foot art museum in Paris to share its cultural values with the general public.

Designed by starchitect Frank Gehry for more than $130 million, the building will act as a home for the company’s public and private art collections, as well as a showcase for temporary exhibitions and performances by contemporary artists. In the months following its official public opening on October 27, the museum’s programming will include commissions inspired by the building’s architecture and retrospective concerts by German electronic band Kraftwerk.

Giving back, Louis Vuitton style

According to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault – whose $30 billion fortune makes him France’s richest man – the Fondation Louis Vuitton is a way for the company to give back to the city.

“(It’s) showing that we are very good (citizens) and that we are working not only for profit, but also for something that is transcendent,” he told CNN at the building’s inauguration. To sweeten the deal, LVMH will give the museum and its contents to the city of Paris in 55 years.

Louis Vuitton is part of a growing legion of fashion houses lending their names and funds to artistic causes. In 2008, Italian luxury brand Furla started a foundation to support young Italian artists, and Fondazione Prada has co-produced art works and organized contemporary exhibitions since the nineties. A number of brands, including LVMH-owned Fendi, have also volunteered to finance the restoration of various Roman monuments like modern-day Medici.

Working with a starchitect

The building itself is as much of a cultural contribution as the art it contains. Gehry, one of the world’s most well-known architects, is famous for designing unconventional cultural centers that draw as much interest as the happenings inside, like his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

Read: The surreal architecture you wish existed

Already referred to as the “glass bird” and “the iceberg” by the public, Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton was inspired by classic Parisian glass architecture like the Grand Palais. It is meant to evoke ships and a sense of movement, like wind pushing through sails. Because of its glass covering, the building changes character throughout the day as the light comes and goes.

It’s showing that we are very good citizens and that we are working not only for profit, but also for something that is transcendent. Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH

The hard sell

But like other non-traditional buildings in Paris – from the Eiffel Tower in 1889 to I.M. Pei’s glass Louvre Pyramid 100 years later – Gehry’s building has received a certain amount of back-lash.

“France is a country where, as you know, we have a lot of manifestations, of protests. Each time you do something, people are against,” Arnault said. “Even for this fantastic building we had to go through a lot of protests before being able to finish it.”

However, the Fondation is hopeful that their museum will ascend to landmark status like the controversial buildings that preceded it. At this point, it seems more than possible. If anyone can sell an experience, it’s LVMH.

Thirteen years in the making, the museum is the brainchild of Bernard Arnault, the chief executive and founder of LVMH. France's richest man envisioned a bold new piece of architecture in the capital that would tie the world's largest luxury group with the cutting edge of art and design.

The private museum that opens to the public on Oct. 27 will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years.

Reflecting sky, clouds and light, the airy and audacious building by Los Angeles-based architect Gehry jutting from a one-hectare plot on the western edge of the city resembles a swaying ship poised over a rectangular pool of water.

Anchored by imposing iron and wood girders that evoke Belle Epoque steelwork, and relying on aerospace technology for its construction, Gehry's masterstroke is the building's 12 undulating sails covering an area of 13,500 square meters.

The rectangular panels of glass made in specially-created ovens in Italy reflect the light in different ways as they appear to twist this way and that. They float over the body of the building, ""the iceberg,"" constructed of fiber-reinforced concrete known as Ductal.

From the inside, cutaways allow glimpses of the surrounding Jardin d'Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne as well as the Eiffel Tower and La Defense business center.

""We had to make a building that was glass and ephemeral and then that became a sailing ship for me, a regatta,"" Gehry said at a press viewing of the museum on Thursday.

The architect behind the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles said ""a sense of movement was important.""

""It looks like it's moving slowly through the Bois de Boulogne and that it reflects the trees and garden,"" Gehry said.

Eleven galleries provide 3,850 square meters (41,441 square feet) of exhibition space to house temporary shows and a permanent collection, which will include works borrowed from Arnault's personal collection.

""It's Magnificent""

The ambitious project took 100 engineers assembled by Gehry and a total of 3,000 workers. French media reports say the project's original price tag of approximately 100 million euros ($127.5 million) has been largely surpassed.

""You don't put a price tag on a dream,"" Arnault said, when asked how much the project cost.

Besides technical challenges, the building faced opposition from neighborhood groups worried about less green space.

""The few people who decide to build audacious things are badly understood, and it's only when the project is finished that you hear, 'My God, it's magnificent!'"" Gehry told Paris Match magazine this month.

The project, which has garnered kudos from around the world, also represents a major publicity coup for Arnault, 65, a sometimes controversial figure in French high society.

Arnault faced a backlash in the media two years ago for requesting Belgian nationality as France prepared to introduce a 75 percent supertax. He later withdrew the request, saying it was not motivated by tax concerns.

Arnault's ambitious project is one his arch rival, Francois Pinault, founder of PPR, which has now become the luxury group called Kering, never accomplished in Paris.

Also an avid contemporary art collector, Pinault envisioned a museum built on a former Renault plant in nearby Boulogne Billancourt. Delays and bureaucratic red tape hindered the project, however, and he eventually opted for Venice, where the Palazzo Grassi now holds the Pinault collection."

LVMH +4% to $27bn as Asia slows - TRBusiness,"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLTQtdG8tMjdibi1hcy1hc2lhLXNsb3dzLzY2NTc00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LVMH has reported a 4% revenue rise to €21.4bn ($27bn) for the first nine months of 2014 but the pressure is on in Asia.

The luxurygoods company said that DFS benefited from sustained airport activity ‘while certain tourist destinations suffered the repercussions of financial or geopolitical changes’.

The good news was that ‘organic revenue’ also grew by 4% compared to the same period in 2013 and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton was also upbeat that ‘all business groups grew’, with the exception of Wines & Spirits. This sector continued to suffer from destocking by distributors in China following the government’s determined drive against corporate gift giving and bribery.

With organic revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter, LVMH says the trend remains comparable to that recorded in the first half of the year. An improved growth rate in Europe and the United States during the quarter compensated for the slowdown observed in Asia.

In short, LVMH acknowledges that it is ‘an uncertain economic and financial environment’ and as such it will continue its strategy focused on ‘innovation and targeted geographic expansion in the most promising markets’. The company said: “LVMH will rely on the power of its brands and the talent of its teams to further extend its global leadership in the luxury market in 2014”.

FAST GROWING RETAIL DIVISION

The Selective Retailing business group – which is fast catching up the leading Fashion & Leather Goods division in terms of sales turnover, recorded organic revenue growth of 8% for the first nine months of 2014. LVMH said: “DFS benefited from sustained airport activity while certain tourist destinations suffered the repercussions of financial or geopolitical changes”.

By contrast, the luxurygoods company said: “Sephora continued to gain market share in key regions. Comparable store revenue growth was particularly strong in the United States and the Middle East. The expansion of the distribution network continues with the opening of its first stores in Indonesia.

“Online sales are rapidly increasing in all regions, confirming its leadership in the digital and mobile space.” The Selective division generated sales of €6.6bn ($8,3bn) +5% in reported terms.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group – LVMH’s largest sales division – recorded organic revenue growth of 3% for the first nine months of the year. The company said that Louis Vuitton continued its strong momentum in innovation and creative development driven by Nicolas Ghesquière.

It added: “True to the Maison’s spirit of innovation, collaboration and boldness, the launch of the new Monogram collection, as interpreted by six famous designers, will be one of the highlights of the fourth quarter. In parallel, new leather lines continue to progress.

P&C OUTPERFORMS MARKET

“Loro Piana remained focused on its strategy of qualitative development. Fendi and Céline made good progress and continued to expand their leather goods and footwear collections while developing their store networks. Other brands, such as Givenchy, Berluti and Kenzo, continued to strengthen their positions”. This division generated €7.6bn ($9.6bn) which corresponded to +8% in reported terms and +3% under organic measure.

Perfume and Cosmetics came in at number three with sales of €2.8bn ($3.5bn) up 4% in reported terms and a rise of 8% in organic, as LVMH pointed out that it outperformed the market.

The luxurygoods company said: “Parfums Christian Dior continued to benefit from the momentum of its iconic products, in particular with new momentum for J’Adore and the success of Dior Addict.

“The make-up segment also contributed to the good performance of the brand. Guerlain was boosted by the launch of its new men’s fragrance, L’Homme Idéal, and the growing success of its premium skincare range Abeille Royale. Fresh, Benefit and Make Up For Ever enjoyed excellent performances”.

Not so dynamic was the Wines & Spirits division, where sales for the first nine months declined by 7% in reported accountancy and by -3% to €2.6bn ($3.2bn) under organic measure.

ASIA IS A BIG CONCERN

LVMH commented that this group suffered from the continued destocking in the Cognac market in China where it has traditionally sold very high value products. However, continued destocking by distributors has continued, while Hennessy is said to have had a better time and generated ‘excellent momentum’ in the United States. Also more positive was the Champagne sales performance in the third quarter, which LVMH said was driven by strength in the American and Japanese markets.

Last, but not least, the growing Watches & Jewelry business group reported organic revenue growth of +5% for the first nine months of 2014 to €1.9bn ($2.4bn) and +2% in reported terms. LVMH commented that the third quarter showed ‘a notable acceleration in the jewellery segment, driven notably by Bvlgari, while watches continued to be impacted by the cautious purchasing behaviour of multi-brand retailers in an uncertain economic environment.

It added that the launch of the new watch for women Lvcea by Bvlgari and the success of Hublot’s iconic lines were the key highlights of the quarter."

Then he apparently forgot all about it.

He asked the zoo to address the problem. The zookeepers said that lions would be lions, so Boussac responded in a way that only an incredibly wealthy person could do: he bought the zoo.

In 1952, a rich man called Marcel Boussac, who lived in a luxury apartment beside the Bois de Boulogne, was unable to sleep because of the lions calling for their breakfast (and their mates) beneath his window.

A vast glass structure, a great airy ship of a building, has sailed into the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, and if lions did not have exceptionally loud roars at six in the morning, it might not have happened at all.

So did everyone else until a few decades later when the new head of the luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) was puzzling over his latest acquisitions.

There, on the furthest reaches of an empire of luxury brands that included fashion house Christian Dior and champagne-maker Dom Perignon, was a five-hectare zoological garden complete with a little train, hothouses, pony rides and a petting zoo (although there were absolutely no lions).

The discovery gave LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault an extraordinary idea. He would build an art gallery there that would seem to float like clouds. It would be a new European home of contemporary art.

When his art adviser, Jean-Paul Claverie, took him (rather reluctantly, the story goes) to Bilbao in Spain to see the Guggenheim Museum, he knew he wanted the same architect, Frank Gehry, to build his dream.

""I met Bernard Arnault a couple of times, I guess,"" says Gehry, now 82, in an interview from California. ""Then one day his assistant called, and said he'd like to talk to me about a museum.

""When I was next in Paris, I met him, and he took me by the Jardin d'Acclimitation. He said it was a very important site that he had the rights to, and he was looking for something special for his foundation.""

Gehry was overwhelmed by the site, thinking immediately of French writer Marcel Proust playing there as a child and others - writers and Impressionist artists - who made this park famous.

""When I lived in Paris in 1960, I visited Bois de Boulogne, but even though I had young daughters, I didn't go to the Jardin. I should have,"" he says.

One of the key architectural considerations (as well as the desire to make it beautiful, practical and environmental, and to waste as little as possible) was the fact that the original planning permission was for a bowling alley.

This meant they had to stick to a single storey as much as possible (plus a basement and glass sails). But the end result, which cost an estimated US$135 million and is formally known as the Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation, stretches every concept of a single storey there is.

""We made a bunch of models or maquettes with blocks of wood, and then with plastic. We started riffing on the kind of a glass enclosure you could have that would make sense with the building and the park,"" Gehry says.

""We did several models, and Bernard picked the one that he liked the best, and set us off in a direction. He was very consistent all the way through, and kept pulling us back to that model if we veered off course.""

The result is a spectacular fantasy of uplift, with views of the whole of Paris, including one of the Eiffel Tower glimpsed between glass walls that will no doubt become iconic as soon as millions of visitors start photographing it.

There are 12 glass sails - the smallest is 500 square metres, the largest 3,000 - and there's a team of robot cleaning machines, and human alpinists with ropes, crampons and brushes for the tricky bits, to clean it all.

Some of the curved glass is made up of a grid of small white dots, which means that it is good at reflecting the sky. The sails are linked by steel struts clad with larch, supporting an inner cube-shaped core of galleries and offices and halls and restaurants clad with 19,000 panels of Ductal high-performance concrete.

The Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation.

There is an accuracy in LVMH's claims that this new temple of contemporary art is ""haute couture in architecture"". Each panel was individually moulded in silicon moulds, although the elements are all apparently structural, and not just about looks.

Seen as a whole, the design gives the feel of things pulling and supporting and stretching. There is a sense that, just when you are not paying attention, those great glass wings will unclip and pull out, and the whole structure will just fly away.

Sometimes I look at it and it looks like a regatta in the park Frank Gehry

""Sometimes I look at it, and it looks like a regatta in the park,"" Gehry says. ""I'm a sailor, and I use sailing metaphors for my work sometimes."" (Gehry has a Beneteau 44.7 sailing boat which he doesn't race himself ""but I let the kids in the office race it and it's very fast"".)

Walking round the building, with the sun glinting on glass, the fast boat analogy is evident. Water tumbles in surprisingly powerful waves down a grand, wide water stairway to the basement concert hall lined with Ellsworth Kelly single-colour panels, and seating 350 people. This will be hard to notice, as the seats are often neatly hidden in the floor.

""The waterfall started because we were trying to get an extra floor in. With the glass we were allowed toet an extra floor up but we still needed more space, so we created a floor below the natural grade. We studied about 50 different ways to deal with that slope face.

""I think the varying ideas for that went on almost until the end,"" Gehry says. ""Sometimes we carved it out, and sometimes we made islands in it. In the end the one we chose was the simplest idea, and it stuck.""

A veil of mystery over first exhibits

Except for some final finishing touches, the new art museum in the Bois de Boulogne is complete. But what of the art that will go in the 11 gallery spaces at the Fondation Louis Vuitton? The owners are keeping that mostly under wraps until just before three open days starting October 24.

Not even Frank Gehry knows, and he designed the space: the client, Bernard Arnault, didn't say, and he didn't ask.

""I never asked Tom Krens what he was going to put into the Bilbao museum [in the 1990s] and he did pretty well,"" Gehry says.

""Bernard knew that I was pretty linked in to the contemporary art scene, and that I knew that he was going to show contemporary art, and that I would understand how to make a gallery for that.""

One reason for all the secrecy is that if collectors had known the foundation's artistic director, Suzanne Pagé, was looking for a particular theme, artist, or movement, they might have held on to works in the hope that the prices would rise.

Even so, it was evident early on that Olafur Eliasson would be among the featured artists. The Danish-Icelandic artist is known for enormous projects that play with colour, light and space, and he has been visiting the venue, testing out possibilities for installations.

""It was difficult for him to do that until the building was nearly finished,"" Gehry says. There had been many experiments in August and September ""and some of it worked and some of it didn't"".

Other artists reportedly commissioned to create projects for the opening include Taryn Simon, who experiments with photography, text and graphic design, and Sarah Morris, a painter and filmmaker who often gets her inspiration from urban landscapes.

The foundation is keen to emphasise the exhibits are not from Arnault's personal collection, although it is unlikely that the works will be completely divergent from his taste.

Arnault's first big purchase was a Monet; but he has since turned to mid-late 20th and 21st century artists, and has bought works by Americans including Doug Aitken, Richard Serra and Ellsworth Kelly (whose colour field works in red, blue, yellow and green were hung in the concert hall of the new art museum in September). He also has works by British artists Francis Bacon and Damien Hirst, Japan's Takashi Murakami, and Yves Klein, a Frenchman who patented his own ultramarine blue.

""Suzanne Pagé had very strong feelings about the gallery she wanted. She wanted to explore shapes,"" Gehry says.

The main mission of Vuitton's new Paris museum is to promote the creation of contemporary art. That means its galleries will showcase commissioned works, as well as pieces from its permanent collection, and special exhibitions.

The initial programme will unfold in three stages between the last week of October and July 2015, each featuring a temporary exhibition, representative works from the permanent collection, and a series of events.

The first phase, which runs until December, is devoted to exploring the architecture of the building: permanent pieces aside, there will be an exhibition on Gehry's work for the foundation, and several commissions related to the design of the new museum, including a work by Eliasson.

There will also be a recital by Chinese pianist Lang Lang on October 28, and a series of concerts by electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk in November.

The Fondation Louis Vuitton contemporary art museum, a massive structure just outside Paris of billowing sails and glass designed by Frank Gehry, was inaugurated by French President François Hollande on Monday.

Thirteen years in the making, the museum is the brainchild of France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, the chief executive and founder of LVMH.

The eleven galleries provide 3,850 square metres (41,441 square feet) of exhibition space to house temporary shows and a permanent collection, which will include works borrowed from Arnault’s personal collection.

The ambitious project took 100 engineers assembled by famed Los Angeles-based architect Gehry and a total of 3,000 workers. French media reports say the project’s original price tag of approximately 100 million euros ($127.5 million) has been largely surpassed.

“You don’t put a price tag on a dream,” Arnault said, when asked about the final cost of the project.

The privately owned museum will open to the public on October 27, but will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years.

Reflecting sky, clouds and light, the airy and audacious building by the architect behind the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, juts from a one-hectare plot on the western edge of the city.

From the inside, cutaways allow glimpses of the surrounding Jardin d’Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne as well as the Eiffel Tower and La Defense business centre.

Controversy and rivalry

The building faced stiff opposition from neighbourhood groups worried about less green space.

“The few people who decide to build audacious things are badly understood, and it’s only when the project is finished that you hear, ‘My God, it’s magnificent!’” Gehry told Paris Match magazine this month.

The project, which has garnered kudos from around the world, also represents a major publicity coup for Arnault, 65, a sometimes controversial figure in French high society.

Arnault faced a backlash in the media two years ago for requesting Belgian nationality as France prepared to introduce a 75 percent supertax. He later withdrew the request, saying it was not motivated by tax concerns.

Arnault’s ambitious project is one in the eye to his arch rival Francois Pinault, founder of PPR, which has now become the luxury group called Kering.

Also an avid contemporary art collector, Pinault envisioned a museum built on a former Renault plant in nearby Boulogne Billancourt. Delays and bureaucratic red tape hindered the project, however, and he eventually opted for Venice, where the Palazzo Grassi now holds the Pinault collection.

LVMH talks 'DFS' to the analysts - TRBusiness,"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLXRhbGtzLWRmcy10by10aGUtYW5hbHlzdHMvNjY1NDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony described a challenging scenario for DFS Group in his conference call with financial analysts earlier this month.

Addressing the world’s leading travel retailer’s results in the third quarter of LVMH’s nine-month calendar trading period, Guiony said DFS’ development was ‘partially offset by a weak yen impacting travel destinations of Japanese travellers’.

He added that DFS’ Hong Kong Airport L&T, P&C and GM concessions continued to perform well, although the Gallerias in Hong Kong and Macao saw some softening due to the change in profile in ‘presequence of the Mainland Chinese clientele’.

“The North American airport concessions also delivered strong growth and DFS also began the renovation in its Changi Airport concession in Singapore. And finally the loyalty programme continued its successful roll-out,” he said in his preamble.

Not surprisingly, some analysts were very keen to ask Guiony about the last month’s challenging environment caused by the street demonstrations in Hong Kong, even though a good deal of this actually took place outside of the third quarter trading period in October.

Antoine Belge of HSBC was one questioner who enquired about Cognac sales, destocking in China and LVMH’s hedging policy and also whether the trading environment for DFS has deteriorated more recently after the retailer appeared to have performed quite resiliently in the third quarter.

DFS: PLUS 7% TO 8% IN HY1

He also asked whether the group hopes to recoup some of its sales in Hong Kong, or through other points of sale in different destinations?

After responding to these other points, Guiony turned his attention to DFS, saying that the situation in Hong Kong is a little bit complex to analyze. He said DFS’ numbers in Hong Kong ‘were about plus 7% to 8% in H1’and ‘very slightly and breaking even’ in Q3.

He said ‘definitely we have already seen Q3 some negative impact on the business’, as he pointed to the well-publicised protests in the Central area, which he said ‘progressively crystallized’ during the course of the quarter.

He added that this has affected the business ‘and particularly when it comes to top-end customers’, or the independent travellers, as opposed to those travelling in groups.

Guiony said that obviously the big demonstration in Hong Kong began right at the end of the group’s third quarter, so the business itself was not affected in Q3.

However, he added that the numbers in early October are ‘not too bad’ although they are ‘quite complex to read’, since they compare with very low numbers last year due to a change in the regulations in China regarding group travel. He said it has to be remembered that the figures ‘were extremely poor in Hong Kong last year at the same period’.

Guiony added: “So basically the situation is I think we are down something like 5% or 6% in Hong Kong in the first two weeks of the month which is not bad in itself…”, but having said that he warned that there is ‘more to come’ following the decision by the Chinese authorities to no longer grant visas to group tourists.

The DFS Galleria in Canton Road has been less affected by the Hong Kong demonstrations.

MISSING CHINESE TOUR GROUPS

Addressing the HSBC analyst’s question thoroughly, Guiony said that since this rule change ‘we hardly see anyone now as far as groups are concerned… we don’t see many people in the stores’.

He added: “So it’s a little bit too early to really assess the impact of the current situation, which, by the way, is not over [speaking on October 15-Ed].

“So really if we tell you to assess the impact of the current situation, the comments I’m making and the figures I just gave you are Hong Kong downtown and a point to bear in mind is that the airport [DFS’ three core category concession-Ed] is not particularly affected by that.

“The first two weeks of October… the airport is about 10%. It was up also 10% in Q3 and we’re doing good business in the airport, which has nothing really to do with what’s going on in Central.

Guiony then answered a series of questions from Thomas Chauvet at Citigroup, which included profits potential for the group in the second half allied to future expansion ambitions – and also against a first half trading background which included additional costs, with restructuring at TAG Heuer, rental inflation at DFS Los Angeles and San Francisco and Marc Jacobs start-up costs.

Chauet also mentioned LVMH’s decision to sell off most of its 23% holding in Hermès and its latest investment with DFS’ planned new debut opening in Europe and Venice in 2016. He also asked whether there is anything else the analysts should be aware of and are the cost affects related to these aforementioned developments going to carry on into the second half?

EUROPEAN GALLERIA EXCITEMENT

Guinoy said DFS and LVMH remain excited about the new downtown location related to the projected investment in Venice, but he also added that he couldn’t see DFS investing in another big airport operator in any large-scale strategic move.

He added: “And as far as our overall acquisition strategy is concerned, you know that we are clearly optimistic and I’d say opportunistic and that we have nothing in mind and we will try to concentrate as you suggested on organic growth, which is obviously the most important thing for us.”

Addressing a further series of questions related to Chinese spending, sales performance and Cognac sell out, Guinoy said: “Okay. So let’s start with Mainland China. In Fashion and Leather our growth was a bit lower than what it was for Q2 shared by most of the brands – Vuitton probably a little bit more than others.

“We saw more action basically outside China than within China – I mean with Chinese customers obviously. The tendency for Chinese customers to shop more abroad than they do at home is still there in Q3, so it has a little bit of an impact on our figures. But all-in-all I mean we are a bit lower than what we were in Q2, a bit more compared to Q1, but lower than Q2 – but nothing really striking.

“And Cognac where our selling numbers in China were sharply down in terms of volumes in Q3 we were down about 50% of EBIT more than that. So, we will find it a bit harsh so reconcile this and sell out numbers, because the basis is entirely different. So, I will not go into all the details with the number of cases, etcetera.”

The next series of questions came from Hermine de Bentzmann at Raymond James, related initially to the Watch and Jewelry division, which he noted, had experienced a ‘quite dynamic’ quarter.

Q4 PROSPECTS?

But he also wanted to know what kind of slowdown LVMH is expecting in the division in Q4 due to the recent protests in Hong Kong, as well as the company’s thoughts on the recent trends it has noted on trading in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.

Guiony responded by saying that by region the Watch and Jewelry business was in line in Europe and in US and a little better in Europe and it was much better in Asia, although pointed out that LVMH’s watch business in Asia ‘is relatively small’.

As for the impact of recent events in Hong Kong, he added: “What’s happening today in Hong Kong will have some impacts probably, although a big part of our business takes place in Kowloon and Kowloon is less affected than Central.” [DFS currently operates three downtown T Galleria stores in Hong Kong, located in Canton Road, Hysan Place in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui East in Kowloon-Ed].

As for the other countries mentioned by the questioner, Guiony said the Taiwanese market as a whole for the group is quite soft and Singapore is down quite significantly and somewhere between -5% and -7%.

He said this is mainly due to Chinese customers not visiting Singapore, Malaysia or Thailand in their normal numbers and for reasons connected with the political situation in Thailand and the aircraft crash in Malaysia.

Guiony added: ‘This business is under pressure. Singapore is not going too well, unlike Korea, which has a good year and a fantastic quarter. We see more and more Chinese tourists in Korea and basically the people we don’t see in Singapore – and we see less in Hong Kong [who] tend to go to Korea. So the Korean business was very good and has been good since the beginning of the year and was good in Q3.”

[As reported earlier this month, LVMH announced a 4% revenue rise to €21.4bn ($27bn) for the first nine months of 2014, but the pressure is clearly on in Asia. The luxurygoods company said that DFS benefited from sustained airport activity ‘while certain tourist destinations suffered the repercussions of financial or geopolitical changes’.

LVMH Foundation for Creation by Frank Gehry - Building,"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1aWxkaW5nLmNvLnVrL2J1aWxkaW5ncy9sdm1oLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tZm9yLWNyZWF0aW9uLWJ5LWZyYW5rLWdlaHJ5LzUwNzE3NjIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new Frank Gehry-designed art gallery is set to open in Paris this week - the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy Foundation for Creation (LVMH Foundation) built at an estimated cost of £80m.

The LVMH Foundation lies on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne, the French capital’s second-largest park, and while privately owned and funded, the new art gallery will be donated to the city of Paris after 55 years.

Set at the foot of a dramatically cascading artificial pool, the building works as two separate but interlocking structures. The inner block, known as the “iceberg” is the primary load-bearing structure and supports its own weight as well as some of the weight of the glass and glulam canopies. The iceberg is clad in fibre-reinforced concrete panels. All the panels, like the glass, curve in two directions, ensuring that the frenetic fluidity of the surface envelope is never interrupted.

The encasing glass and glulam structures are known as the “sails”. The glass canopies, which peak at 43m and incorporate an incredible 13,500m2 of glass, are supported by glulam columns fixed to both the ground and the iceberg.

Two types of glass are used on the sails, a transparent version towards the base of the building and a milkier, translucent form as it rises upwards. The translucent glass is fritted to prevent solar glare and, according to Gehry, to superimpose reflections of the park on to the structure.

He claims his building is inspired by Paris’ fabulous tradition of 19th-century glass buildings, such as the Grand Palais on the Champs-Elysees, although local residents who have fiercely opposed the project might not appreciate the reference."
