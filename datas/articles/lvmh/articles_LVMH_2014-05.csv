BoF: LVMH is the world's largest luxury group, with €46 billion ($52 billion) in revenue and more than 70 brands. What does that mean for the people who work here?

CG: LVMH is flourishing, but I think what is less known from outside is how much the group has grown in terms of the souls behind the brands here. When I joined LVMH in 2007 we were probably about 60,000 employees and today we're at about 156,000.

BoF: So, spotting and nourishing the right talent is more important than ever before.

CG: It is. Even more so in luxury than anywhere else. Because we are trying to reinvent the brands, trying to set trends, and selling dreams in many ways, this takes special personalities. You don't have to go up to the creative director or CEO, you can see it at store management.

BoF: What does the vast ecosystem of brands and disciplines at LVMH offer to a professional working in the luxury sector?

CG: Perspectives. Unique perspectives, which are unparalleled. We are sitting in a group which is a galaxy of brands, across different sectors, LVMH is the binding or roof if you like. If you are a talent today looking at making a career in the luxury sector we are able to accompany you through a journey, not only a job, but really a journey because of the multiple opportunities we have to offer, in different sectors and different geographies. Last year, we had 2,700 managers who moved within the ecosystem.

What is as important as numbers is that we created a platform directly linked to our business strategy. Say we want to develop our business in Africa tomorrow, do we have the organisation that can support that, the right people, the right skills? In HR you work with timelines that are long, anticipating needs and building strengths. This helps us to retain and develop different experiences in our talents, transfer know-how and best practices, building a sense of community and belonging.

BoF: I can see how this works for LVMH. But why is mobility an important part of the professional experience?

ADVERTISEMENT

CG: Mobility is key. People certainly join a company, a house, a 'Maison', but they more and more pay attention to the whole ecosystem it belongs to, and to what the values are behind it. How successful is the group? How solid is it financially? How can I make an impact and have meaning in my work? People today are attracted to a place that offers long-term prospects.

It is not enough to attract and source the right talent. You want that person to develop and flourish so he or she can be retained. The more you take care of your people, not only the more you can retain them, but the more it gets known inside and outside. People see that at LVMH mobility is not only a promise, it’s happening. Two jobs out of three, in our key positions, are filled internally.

As a young professional you maybe joining Sephora, but, one day, you could be the head of Fred - a small jewellery brand with great potential. It’s aspirational, it’s great!

BoF: What about training?

CG: Regardless of what brand they work for, and what training they are receiving, we want everyone to be exposed to the variety and perspectives of the group as a whole.

For instance, the RISE (Results in Social Entrepreneurship) programme mixes two key dimensions because it is both a social-responsibility project and a talent-development project. It couples an internal talent, who can be from anywhere in the world from within LVMH, with someone who has set up a business with a social purpose.

We lend them talent, they work together developing a business plan, a digital platform, etc. That makes our own talent aware of a different reality, while we give skills, coaching, and know-how. It’s giving back while growing.

BoF: What are your thoughts regarding the interactions between creative people and business people at LVMH?

ADVERTISEMENT

CG: One of the common denominators of all of the training programs is that they all involve creatives – be it the wine-maker, the perfume 'nose' or creatives from the fashion houses. It is very important for us to make business people aware of their colleagues in creative capacities, and allow them to see, meet and learn how to deal with creatives, in the larger sense of the word.

BoF: Any advice for prospective applicants to LVMH?

CG: I think what both young professionals joining an employer for the first time and people at a more advanced stage in their careers look for today is meaning; impact. If everyday you see that you can have an impact, and that you are allowed to use precisely what makes you excited to go to work everyday, that's the best feeling. It will allow you to perform better, but more importantly, it will make you happy and motivated and fulfilled.

Our HR slogan is the ‘Future of Tradition’: you are here to understand the past, be inspired by the history and the roots, but at the same time, make it even more relevant today and tomorrow. We are looking for personalities, for leadership, for cultural fit, for ambassadors of histories, for the ability to work within ambiguous situations and with creative people. And that’s not for everybody – I find it incredibly fascinating.

LVMH Bets On Chinese Dumplings With $100 Million Culinary Investment - Jing Daily,"Fri, 02 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWJldHMtb24tY2hpbmVzZS1kdW1wbGluZ3Mtd2l0aC0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1jdWxpbmFyeS1pbnZlc3RtZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delicious investment: when considering buying a stake in restaurant group Crystal Palace, LVMH-owned L Capital Asia commissioned a taste test for soup dumplings, or xiao long bao.

The world’s largest luxury conglomerate may have made its fortune from a brand portfolio known for high-end handbags and top-shelf spirits, but LVMH’s private-equity arm has decided that it’s now time to add Chinese food to its vast portfolio.

According to Singapore news outlet Business Times , LVMH-owned L Capital Asia has purchased Singapore-based Chinese restaurant group Crystal Jade for an estimated US$100 million. The buy will give the company more than a 90 percent stake in the chain that was founded in 1991.

Crystal Jade operates multiple dining concepts that range from the mass market to the top end, according to the report. Currently, fine dining accounts for only 10 percent of revenue for the company, which operates not only in Singapore, but also across Asia in locations including southern China and Hong Kong.

L Capital hopes to help the Crystal Jade globalize with increased wine offerings and improved branding. The company is eyeing Europe and the Middle East, as well as China’s lower-tier cities for expansion opportunities. Restaurant chain executives have expressed optimism about its prospects thanks to LVMH’s branding expertise. ""The new owner ... is good in planning, promoting, marketing, know-how that we lack,” said Crystal Jade Group Chairman And CEO Ip Yiu Tung. In addition, he added that LVMH’s global retail presence will help the company line up prime real estate for new restaurants across the world.

With annual profit growth averaging around 20 percent a year since its founding, Crystal Jade is clearly an attractive investment opportunity, but L Capital also took pains to make sure it was impressed with the quality of the food: according to the report, it meticulously checked online reviews and commissioned a taste test for the restaurant’s noodles and xiao long bao (often called ""soup dumplings"" in English).

The investment is part of LVMH's efforts to build up a diverse portfolio as China's traditional luxury market slows. Last July, L Capital Asia bought a stake in Chinese beauty brand Marubi, and is currently hoping to buy a Chinese online fashion company."
LVMH owner lauds Dom Pérignon staying power - Decanter.com,"Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1vd25lci1sYXVkcy1kb20tcGVyaWdub24tc3RheWluZy1wb3dlci0xMzAyOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The billionaire owner of Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault, believes that Dom Pérignon Champagne has more chance of staying relevant to the next generation of consumers than other luxury goods such as Apple's iPhone.

Speaking on the CNBC business channel in Paris this week, Arnault said that he is not concerned about fragile economic conditions around the world having an effect on demand for luxury products.

Specifically, he pointed to luxury Champagne brands as an example of how companies can marry heritage and innovation to maintain a high-end cache among consumers that can span several generations.

This, he said, is harder to achieve in some other sectors. ‘For instance, I have great admiration for the iPhone. I have an iPhone. But can you say that in 20 years people will still use an iPhone? Maybe not.

‘What I can say is that 20 years from now, I’m quite convinced that people will still drink Dom Pérignon.’

Champagne endured a sluggish year in 2013, with global sales down by 1.5% in volume versus 2012, to 304m bottles, and 2% in value, to €4.3bn, according to figures from industry body CIVC.

LVMH, also owner of Krug, Ruinart and Moët & Chandon, saw Champagne volume sales fall by 1% over the same period. However, Arnault reported ‘strong demand for prestige cuvées’, as have several rivals, which appears to support his assertion this week that consumers have not lost their appetite for luxury goods in leaner economic times.

Forbes magazine estimates the Arnault family’s fortune at US$35.7bn.

LVMH Burgundy deal prompts concerns among winemakers - Decanter.com,"Thu, 01 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXJndW5keS1kZWFsLXJldmVhbHMtY29uY2VybnMtYW1vbmctd2luZW1ha2Vycy0xMzEwMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Several Burgundy winemakers fear that the arrival of French luxury goods group LVMH in their region, via its acquisition of Clos des Lambrays, could lead to an unwelcome era of big company owners and 'astronomical' wine prices.

LVMH has acquired 8.66 hectares of Clos des Lambrays, located in Morey-Saint-Denis and one of the largest grand cru vineyards in Burgundy.

While the deal has not come as a surprise to many, particularly seeing as Clos des Lambrays was known to be on the market, some producers see the move as a dangerous sign of things to come in Burgundy.

‘I think there are several growers who don’t see this as a good thing, because tomorrow there will be no winemaker owner,’ said Stephane Magnien, who’s namesake domaine also lies in Morey-Sain-Denis.

‘The old Burgundy that we know will no longer exist. It will be worked by workers, and respond to the market.’

He said the price of vineyards in Burgundy means inheritance tax is becoming a headache for small-scale producers who, out of principle, don’t want to cover the extra costs by charging ‘astronomical prices’ for their wines.

A fee was not disclosed for the LVMH deal, but the French agency that monitors agricultural land prices, Safer, last year priced Burgundy grand cru vineyards at €3.8m per hectare. Some in the trade believe that figure is conservative, and there is speculation that LVMH owner Bernard Arnault agreed to pay several times that amount.

‘It’s a worrying evolution,’ added Caroline Parent-Gros, of Domaine A-F Gros, speaking on the LVMH deal.

‘The cost of the land in Burgundy has increased so much that it is now totally disconnected from the profitability. Owning a vineyard is today closer to owning a piece of art than a productive asset.

‘Our concern is that, in a couple of years, family domaines would have to sell their vineyards to big financial groups if they cannot [afford to] keep their lands in the family, as they have done for many generations.’

Outside of the LVMH deal, one could argue that Burgundy has, in a sense, become a victim of its own success. Simon Staples, Asia director at Berry Bros & Rudd, last year declared 2013 the year of Burgundy in Hong Kong. Auction house Sotheby’s saw Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines achieve $7.2m in global auction sales last year, more than any of the Bordeaux first growths.

Jasper Morris, Burgundy buyer for Berrys, said that he expects LVMH to raise the price of wines from Clos des Lambrays in the near future, to reflect the market demand.

However, the LVMH deal itself has only highlighted a wider ongoing tension in Burgundy, rather than caused it, he said, speaking to Decanter.com on the sidelines of the Decanter World Wine Awards judging week in London’s Tobacco Dock, where he is chair of Burgundy tastings.

‘Some people like the idea of higher prices, but many don’t at all,’ he said. Traditionally, ‘Burgundy is a wine for drinking, not for speculation’, he added.

Q&A: Simon Porte Jacquemus on Being a Young Designer in Paris - The Cut,"Wed, 28 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxNC8wNS9xYS1qYWNxdWVtdXMtYS15b3VuZy1kZXNpZ25lci1pbi1wYXJpcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Julien Hekimian/Getty Images

Simon Porte Jacquemus is a 24-year-old self-taught designer who started his own label at age 19. Born in Salon-de-Provence in southeastern France, he has worked his way forward wholly independently, and now has his own studio just off the Place des Vosges. His collections feature crop tops, full skirts, oversize T-shirts, jumbo clown coats, blobby dresses, asymmetrical pieces, and slouchy proportions. He revels in “off” taste and juvenilia (he tells me he sat like a well-behaved child waiting in front of his telephone for our interview to begin).

He’s recently published a book in tandem with his spring/summer 2014 collection, La Grande Motte, a reference to a seaside resort in the Languedoc-Roussillon region built in the 1960s and ‘70s, characterized by its homogenized architecture. He is also one of 12 finalists for the prestigious LVMH Prize, which will be announced today. He spoke to the Cut about Rei Kawakubo, his burgeoning interest in menswear, and why he believes Paris is still the star fashion city.

To start, tell me about your new book, La Grande Motte. What inspired it?

My clothes aren’t actually about clothes or look books. I wanted an object beyond a collection, a “souvenir.” La Grande-Motte is a French town designed by one architect: He did everything from the buildings to the streetlamps to the garbage cans — everything. A lot of people hate it; it’s known to be kind of a yokel-y, trashy town. It’s one of the first books about this place, a vacation spot for the working class.

How did you meet Bertrand le Pluard, who took the pictures and has made several videos of your collections?

We do everything together. People have proposed big-name photographers to work with me, but he’s been with me since the beginning; we do all the films together. I write a film with him before making the clothes, and then I make the collection.

You’re short-listed for the LVMH Fashion Prize. Your collections have a very slacker-girl vibe, and you’ve talked about having a very “Southern France” state of mind. Yet LVMH is about globalism and is an ambitious company. How do you bridge those two worlds?

I felt LVMH to be family-oriented and sincere, especially Delphine Arnault. The company is about luxury, but they’re also really engaged in helping young designers. I felt comfortable, anyway. I want to be a dreamer, but I have to sell clothes; otherwise I can’t evolve. I’m obsessed with selling my clothes, it’s an economic reality: I need to sell for real. I built all this with so little money. Ever since my first season, I realized I had to sell; I needed a commercial strategy.

I read that you started with a minimalist aesthetic partially due to financial constraints. What would you splurge on if you had a bigger budget?

Well, it was still my aesthetic. But I would get rid of details, eliminating pockets when possible, for things to cost less. But I’m not creating stuff like Christian Lacroix, either! If I had a bigger budget I would do more couture moderne: more refined, more exacting, spectacular space-age pieces from the ‘60s; that’s what I like. But always mixed with T-shirts and sneakers. I’ll always be sporty and young.

Why womenswear?

I didn’t choose it; it came to me spontaneously. When I was little I would draw things for women. For the first time I’m starting to think about menswear. If I could — or when I can — I will do menswear.

You worked in retail at Paris’s Comme des Garçons boutique.

I stopped working there last year. It was crazy; it was surreal: I would design my collections for Fashion Week, and then go back to work the next day. It was great. But now I’m working on my collections full-time.

Did retail teach you anything that has since helped you as a designer?

Yes and no … I was at Comme des Garçons; it’s a brand you can learn so much from. There’s both a real creativity and a commercial strategy. It encouraged me: Being there for two years made me stronger, in the sense that it helped me know what I really wanted. There’s a radicalism to Rei Kawakubo: She says “it’s this,” and pushes things in one direction. If you want something, do it all the way. It’s a certain form of … of not humor, but of lightness.

Paris isn’t known for being terribly open to young new designers. Are there other cities you would be interested in creating in?

Fashion is ultra-, ultraclosed. I found so few people I related to. I ignored a lot of rules, but I’m still here. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else, though. I always dreamed of coming to Paris. I remember as a kid hearing this somewhere: “If one day you are known in Paris, you’ll be known the world over.” I tried to lose my Southern French accent early on, so people couldn’t tell that I was not from Paris!

Tell me about how, concretely, you got started here …

Concretely: There were a lot of things I didn’t know — that you needed a press person, that you needed to be sold in boutiques. I first created and designed my website. It still looks pretty much the same today. I bought fabrics, and used a modeliste (pattern-maker).

I moved to Paris when I was 18; I’d just finished high school, and was enrolled in a fashion school in Paris for two or three months. One month in, my mother died. It was a huge shock. It was — is — the shock of my life. I said to myself, Simon, don’t waste any time. I became obsessed with time: “Do everything you can today.” I was obsessed, obsessed. I decided to launch in 2009, and named the label Jacquemus, after my mother.

That’s very moving. It’s been five years now since the launch. How have things changed?

They haven’t, really. It’s always easy to imagine a collection, to invent a film; it’s always difficult to find the right materials, to translate imagination into reality. I can’t hide that now I have a studio, that I have people who work for me. It doesn’t diminish from the workload though. No one is creating with me — and I don’t want anyone to. The more you advance in fashion, the harder it is, that’s kind of the truth of it.

I always say: I don’t do clothes, I do stories. I know why I used the print on a T-shirt; maybe it’s dumb, but that’s my way. I want to dress women. Sometimes there are badly dressed women, who wouldn’t wear my clothes, but I still think they’re très Jacquemus. It’s a whole universe, a concept. Something could be a “Jacquemus”-y shirt, or a “Jacquemus”-y bike.

A bike? What would be Jacquemus-y about a bike?

I just said that because there’s one in front of me! It’s more of a playful spirit, clean, fresh, and at the same time raw. If you put photos in front of me, I could tell you whether things were Jacquemus-y or not!"
Céline Steps Up Presence In China's 'Evolving' Luxury Market - Jing Daily,"Wed, 28 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jZWxpbmUtc3RlcHMtdXAtcHJlc2VuY2UtaW4tY2hpbmFzLWV2b2x2aW5nLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A look from Céline's first China runway show in Beijing's 798 Art Zone last week. (Weibo/石榴笑了的围脖)

As many Chinese luxury consumers once obsessed only with a few top “mega-brands” such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci expand their tastes, a growing number of high-end niche labels are upping their China marketing efforts in response. Last week, LVMH-owned Céline joined this growing group with its first China runway show in Beijing’s 798 Art Zone on May 22.

The low-key presentation displayed the brand’s 2014 Fall/Winter collection, and was attended by Céline-clad celebrities such as Hong Kong singer Faye Wong, mainland actress Mei Ting, mainland singer Na Ying, and stylist Tian Yuan. The event was a smaller affair than Kering-owned rival Balenciaga’s Beijing event held the previous week, which featured a runway show, exhibit, and top celebrities such as Yao Chen and Li Yuchun.

One of the main reasons for Céline’s additional push into China is that the brand recognizes a growing preference for individualism among Chinese consumers. According to CEO Marco Gobbetti in a recent Women’s Wear Daily interview :

“It’s a way to respond to a customer that’s been evolving and growing,” Gobbetti said of the China market. “A few years back they were just approaching the market, and now they are the real experts.”







Gobbetti said Céline appeals to a new generation of Chinese consumers who are active professionals making their own choices. They want quality products and have done extensive research about designs and materials. China consumers still want a full-service retail experience, but they arrive informed and knowledgeable.

One way in which smaller luxury brands are still lagging behind market giants, however, is in their digital strategy. A recent L2 report found that Balenciaga has a slight edge over Céline in its digital marketing strategy in China, but not much of one—both were ranked as “feeble” in their China digital abilities. Balenciaga’s score is likely to improve now that it has a new WeChat account that was launched in March, which it used to promote its Shanghai show. Céline, meanwhile, has a basic China site but no supporting digital presence in China at the moment.

For now, Céline is also holding off on expansion of its brick-and-mortar stores in China, opting instead to renovate its 20 existing China boutiques."

The only way is up for Canadian-born, London-based Thomas Tait, who has scooped the life-changing LVMH Young Designer Prize

BY Olivia Lidbury | 28 May 2014

Thomas Tait is no stranger to winning prizes; in 2010 he won the first Dorchester Collection Fashion Prize (£25,000 worth of funding) and today he has scooped the inaugural LVMH Young Designer Prize.

Judged by a star fashion panel which included Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Phoebe Philo, Nicolas Ghesquière and LVMH's executive vice-president Delphine Arnault, Montreal-born Tate pipped his London Fashion Week 'colleague' Simone Rocha to the post - as well as 10 other fledgling semi-finalist designers.

The €300,000 (approx. £244,000) prize money and mentoring package will no doubt help take Hackney-based Tait's business to the next level. Since graduating from Central Saint Martins (where, aged 24, he was the youngest ever student to complete the womenswear MA course), he launched his label for spring/summer 2011 and is currently stocked in Dover Street Market and MatchesFashion.com in London, as well as a handful of luxury retailers internationally.

Arnault commented: ""The Jury was captivated by the personality and the work of Thomas Tait. He is a great talent. I'm proud LVMH can help him develop his brand. I have no doubt though all the other Prize finalists will have an amazing journey and I wish them luck.""

Semi-finalists Miuniku and Hood by Air were each awarded €100,000 (£82,000) and a year-long mentorship.

Tait's clean and understated aesthetic quickly established him as a name to watch at the shows, and his sense of humour is always apparent - a recent invite to his London Fashion Week show sneakily featured the word 'Lesbians' in the address instead of 'London'.

No doubt luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy, and which recently bought stakes in fellow London labels Nicholas Kirkwood and J. W. Anderson, will be watching its new protégée closely.

Court halts LVMH/DFS Paris project - TRBusiness,"Fri, 30 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9oaXN0b3JpYW5zLWhhbHQtbHZtaGRmcy1wYXJpcy1wcm9qZWN0LzY2ODQ40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Legal action has delayed the $625m redevelopment of the La Samaritaine building where DFS Group hopes to open its first Parisian off-airport store.

LVMH-owns the building and its Tokyo-based architects SANAA have been working towards transforming the mothballed heritage department store into a multi-use luxury hotel, retail, office centre and creche for a 2016 opening, while preserving its French heritage architecture.

But it has come up against an Administrative Court of Paris ruling (May 13, 2014) supported by some local historians who have declared opposition to any further site demolition, despite the acknowledged need for extensive repairs and renovation. [La Samaritaine in Rue de Rivoli was acquired by LVMH in 2001, but was forced to close back in 2005 when it failed to meet new fire regulations-Ed].

The withdrawal of a portion of the construction permit by the Administrative Court of Paris is now being challenged and particularly considering that LVMH appeared to have already satisfied the so called ‘architecte des Bâtiments de France’ that its renovation was fully in keeping with the heritage, architecture and style of the original.

How La Samaritaine may look inside when it is finished in 2016.

HIGHLY RESPECTED BODY

This body is the acknowledged staunch guardian of historic French heritage buildings which ensures that alterations or construction respect original style and aesthetics.

The Academy of Architecture has since come down firmly on LVMH’s side in this dispute, arguing that halting construction is an insult to all of those experts who examined LVMH’s plans meticulously the first time around and were satisfied they were sound and responsible.

It is now encouraging Parisians to sign its petition to protest at this decision to halt reconstruction. The ruling was apparently based on the Administrative Court’s view that the proposed use of an exterior glass facade on the building is somehow out of keeping with acceptable architecture.

The more familiar view of the grand and historic La Samaritaine.

The Academy of Architecture strongly disputes this in its declaration, arguing that this is no more than a value judgment and the permit should be reinstated.

It says heritage buildings must live side by side with people in cities and this restoration has already been widely approved by experts, including the Ministry of Culture, the Mayor of Paris and other bodies."

These are the Singapore businesses it has snapped up in the past five years.

The F&B group, a familiar brand in Singapore, seems an unlikely target for the luxury retail group more often associated with high fashion and premium wines and alcohol. But it was announced this week that LVMH had inked a deal to buy, for an undisclosed sum but which industry sources estimated to be worth about US$100 million, “over 90 per cent” of Crystal Jade.

Crystal Jade has been on a regional and international expansion spree, and plans to open 18 outlets this year, as well as a 20,000-sq ft restaurant in San Francisco which can seat more than 400. Given LVMH’s track record with other Singapore businesses it has acquired, it is likely to boost the company’s expansion plans.

2. Ku De Ta

LVMH bought a 51 per cent stake in the nightclub’s holding company in January 2014, with plans to take the brand global in the coming years. Industry estimates pegged the deal as worth more than $100 million.

L Capital Asia’s managing partner Ravi Thakra told The Straits Times that it is opening a Ku De Ta outlet in Hong Kong’s party district Lan Kwai Fong in the second half of this year and has already secured sites in Thailand and France. There are aggressive expansion plans in the works as he plans to grow the company from its current $50 million revenue to $200 million in four years.

3. Charles & Keith

The homegrown shoe retailer sold a 20 per cent stake to LVMH for more than $30 million after a hot pursuit which saw the company being wooed by other private equity funds and high net-worth investors. The deal valued the company at almost $200 million.

At the time of the deal, the company said it was looking to tap into LVMH’s vast experience so as to expand more easily. And it looks as if the deal has paid off. LVMH has helped the company expand into the vast Chinese market where it now runs about 70 outlets with plans to add 30 to 50 stores a year for the next few years.

4. Heng Long Tannery

Founded in 1947, this homegrown business has been providing exotic crocodile skins to high fashion houses for decades. The low-key tannery shot into the limelight in 2011 when LVMH bought a 51 per cent share of the listed company, valuing it at $160.8 million.

Managing director Koh Chon Tong (seen on the right) told Life! in an interview that having LVMH as a fairy godmother is good for business as he can get advance contracts from crocodile farmers and can afford to stock deeply.

5. Sincere Watch & Jewellery

LVMH was part of a consortium that paid $112.7 million this luxury watch and jewellery retailer in 2009, giving LVMH a 26.3 per cent interest in the company.

Although Sincere was the second biggest watch retailer in Singapore, it had suffered a rocky couple of years before the LVMH deal. It was sold to Hong Kong-based watch company Peace Mark with the aim of breaking into the China market. Peace Mark went belly-up, and Sincere was eventually bought by a group led by its chairman and managing director Tay Liam Wee and LVMH.

LVMH buys more than 90 percent stake in Singapore-based restaurant chain - Coconuts,"Mon, 05 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY29jb251dHMuY28vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL25ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLW1vcmUtOTAtcGVyY2VudC1zdGFrZS1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYmFzZWQtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1jaGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is reportedly spending more than USD100 million for a majority stake in Singapore-based Chinese restaurant chain Crystal Jade.

LVMH’s private equity arm Christina Teo has revealed to Wall Street Journal that the company is working on a more than 90 percent ownership of the company, which now operates over 100 outlets in nine countries the world.

Crystal Jade CEO Ip Yiu Tung’s majority stake will naturally be reduced, but he is expected to continue as CEO for about a year after the big handover.

LVMH adds Crystal Jade to Singapore jewel box - AsiaOne,"Thu, 01 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2x2bWgtYWRkcy1jcnlzdGFsLWphZGUtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWpld2VsLWJveC0w0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE - After three years of courtship, L Capital Asia, the private-equity arm of French luxury goods giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has bought home-grown Chinese restaurant group Crystal Jade in a deal that market sources place at around US$100 million (S$125 million).

As L Capital adds yet another Singapore name to its growing collection of brands, Crystal Jade is set to soar in coming years. The restaurant group will tap LVMH's expertise in branding and marketing, as well as its relationships with landlords worldwide to place outlets in strategic locations.

It plans to expand to Europe and the Middle East in addition to other parts of the world. An initial public offering (IPO) could eventually also be on the cards.

""The business has come to a size that is quite big, and my age is not suitable to carry the business to another level,"" Crystal Jade group chairman and CEO Ip Yiu Tung, 65, told The Business Times over dinner at Paragon's Crystal Jade Golden Palace restaurant, confirming market talk in the past month that the company had been sold.

""The new owner ... is good in planning, promoting, marketing, know-how that we lack,"" he added.

Private-equity firms like L Capital typically invest in companies with the aim of improving their operations and their value before selling their stakes five to 10 years later and returning money to investors.

An industry source told BT last night that the deal will give the chain a boost. ""L Capital can use their broader group clout to great effect, particularly their negotiating power with landlords, because of the wider retail offerings they have,"" he said.

L Capital will be buying more than 90 per cent of Crystal Jade. It typically exits its investments four to six years later, possibly through an IPO or a trade sale to another fund or company.

""We're in no hurry (to exit), we're patient and we take a long-term view,"" L Capital managing director Christina Teo said. ""Eventually we can bring it all over the map, to all regions like the Middle East, the US, Australia, India. These are just the tip of the iceberg.

""A name like Crystal Jade for a Chinese restaurant is also easy to remember. It has strong brand equity and can travel very well globally.""

Crystal Jade will be the first food and beverage (F&B) company and the first Singapore company in L Capital Asia's Fund 2, a 10-year fund started this year with a committed capital of US$1 billion.

Typically, the first five years will be spent investing while the remaining five will be spent divesting. L Capital is ""ahead of its investment schedule"", added Ms Teo.

Crystal Jade is its third investment for its Fund 2, after Australia apparel maker 2XU and Italian luxury shoe brand Giuseppe Zanotti. A fourth purchase to be announced is a Chinese online fashion company. The earnings multiple paid is ""fair and reasonable from both sides"", Ms Teo said.

L Capital's purchase marks the end of an era for Mr Ip, who invested more than $2 million into an ailing restaurant in 1992 and turned it around into a Singapore household name and award-winning brand.

Crystal Jade made around $250 million in revenue last year - a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 per cent a year over the past 20 years. The company is financially strong and did not need any money, Mr Ip revealed.

Group net profit margin has always been in the ""single digits"", even though individual restaurants might hit double-digit percentages. However, earnings have been ""a little bit stagnant in the past few years"", he admitted.

The F&B business has low barriers to entry. Competition is cut-throat, and staff, especially in Singapore, have become a lot harder to hire in recent years with the clampdown on foreign labour and the reluctance of locals to work in the service industry.

""F&B is already a tough business. And with our widely spread-out subsidiaries, there was a lot to do . . . I would like the company to have a future, and this is the only reasonable move,"" Mr Ip explained.

In Singapore, a downturn in retail sentiment has caused landlords to convert many retail shops to F&B outlets, causing an oversupply in the restaurant space, he pointed out.

""We will offer people good food at a reasonable price so that we keep a survivable situation. Once consolidation is done, we'll come up again,"" he added.

For Ms Teo and L Capital, the journey to make Crystal Jade truly international has just begun.

She has plans to improve profitability and product offerings, such as tie-ups with LVMH brands on wine selection.

""If a choice location comes up, hopefully we'll be the first to hear it and get our foot in the door. We will also help in terms of selective expansion. Now, Crystal Jade is only in 10 countries.""

The quality of its food is a plus, she observed. L Capital commissioned an independent taste test for la mian (noodles) and xiao long bao (dumplings) last year and also looked at reviews from restaurant website OpenRice. It found that Crystal Jade ranked top in taste and service in Singapore.

Crystal Jade's numerous dining concepts across the high-volume, profitable mass market to the top-end segment is another strength, Ms Teo noted. The idea is to start people somewhere affordable and then move them up the chain, she added.

Mr Ip said the fine dining segment generates only about 10 per cent of revenues, with margins not necessarily higher compared to the mass market segment. But having a fine dining segment is important to ""let people know we're making very good food"".

Crystal Jade is doing well in places such as Hong Kong, South China, and Vietnam, he added.

This year, the group is due to open new outlets in South Korea, Indonesia and the US, among other places.

He will stay on as CEO for a year while his replacement is being trained. He will still remain with the group as a brand ambassador or adviser. Using the sale proceeds, he is also working on a programme to reward key staff, possibly giving them shares in the company.

The sale of the company he has invested a major part of his life in will help ease some of the pressures he faced in running it round the clock. Now, he intends to be involved with other things, like philanthropy and sustainability initiatives.

""This is a turning point. I will face another future. I won't just go fishing or travelling,"" he said. ""I still need some job to keep me busy.

But not be under very high pressure, so I can enjoy life, and also try my best to grow Crystal Jade. And also, I would like to do something for the world.""
