LVMH, best known as owner of Louis Vuitton, acquired a 17.1 percent stake in Hermès in October 2010, and has since raised its stake in Hermès to more than 22 percent.

Hermès is the second-most valuable luxury brand in the world, and a significant stake in the brand would help LVMH, the world's largest luxury retailer, expand its reach.

Hermès, which is known for its luxe scarves and handbags, accused LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton of insider trading and manipulating share prices in a complaint filed with a Paris court earlier this year, according to a source cited by WWD. LVMH had used a market loophole to bypass requirements to declare share purchases when it initially bought into Hermès.

Now, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has shot back, saying that its acquisition was perfectly legal and that it plans to file a retaliatory complaint against Hermès.

Here's the statement from LVMH (emphasis ours):

""For its part, LVMH strongly reaffirms that the acquisition of its stake in Hermès was entirely legitimate and that unlike Hermès, it awaits the outcome of the AMF enquiry with complete peace of mind. LVMH has no doubt that the enquiry will determine that the Hermès allegations are false and serve no other purpose than to slander and unlawfully undermine another firm in the same industry.

As a result, the LVMH Group has had no choice but to file a suit for slander, blackmail and unfair competition.""

This is far from the first time the two sides have slammed each other publicly during the scuffle.

For instance, LVMH vice chairman Pierre Godé challenged Hermès to produce a ""shred of evidence"" of wrongdoing last year.

At a 2011 press conference, Hermès CEO Patrick Thomas attacked LVMH's actions, saying, ""if you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don't start by raping her from behind.""

So far, the law appears to be on Hermès' side. It won an important victory last year when the Paris Court of Appeal authorized Hermès to group family-owned shares into their own holding company.

The families owns more than 70 percent of Hermès shares, and the holding company gives the families 50.2 percent of the company's capital and priority purchasing rights for the remaining shares owned by family members, according to WWD.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988799691200256}",neutral,0.9988799691200256,0
France's richest man applies to become a (less-taxed) Belgian citizen - FRANCE 24 English,"Sat, 08 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEyMDkwOC1mcmFuY2UtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4tYXBwbGllcy1sdm1oLWxlc3MtdGF4ZXMtYmVsZ2l1bS1jaXRpemVuLWFybmF1bHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE - BELGIUM

France’s wealthiest man, billionaire Bernard Arnault (pictured), has applied for Belgian citizenship, according to reports Saturday in Belgian media, just as France seeks to pass a law taxing incomes above one million euros to the tune of 75 percent.

AFP - Bernard Arnault, the richest man in France and the world's fourth-wealthiest, has applied for Belgian nationality as Paris moves to impose a 75-percent wealth tax, reports said Saturday.

The 63-year-old billionaire head of the LVMH luxury goods empire filed an application with parliament last week to become a naturalised Belgian citizen, the La Libre Belgique daily quoted a senior official as saying.

""The file will be treated the same as all the others,"" Georges Dallemagne, the head of the naturalisation commission, told the paper. ""We currently have 47,000 before us.""

Belgian legislation requires applicants for citizenship to have had at least three years residency in Belgium, barring which they need to prove ties to the country, Dallemagne said.

Arnault lives in Paris and has a home in Brussels, the daily said.

His application comes amid a debate on one of the main pledges that France's President Francois Hollande made during the election campaign earlier this year -- to impose a 75-percent tax on incomes above one million euros.

Press reports this week said that the government was looking to water down the measure by raising the threshold to two million euros for couples and excluding capital gains.

But on Friday Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici vowed that the campaign promise would be ""strictly"" implemented.

The new tax is due to be included in the 2013 budget, which the government expects to finalise later this month.

Arnault, whose fortune is estimated to stand at 41 billion dollars by Forbes magazine, was a close ally of France's former right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Following the election of France's previous Socialist president Francois Mitterrand in 1981, Arnault lived in the United States for three years, returning to France after the Socialists switched to a more conservative economic course.

Zegna Hires Designer From YSL - The New York Times,"Tue, 04 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvMDUvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsL3plZ25hLWhpcmVzLWRlc2lnbmVyLWZyb20teXNsLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The Italian men’s wear company Ermenegildo Zegna moved on Tuesday to strengthen its core brand and breathe new life into its little-known women’s fashion line by hiring a designer best known for his work at Yves Saint Laurent.

The designer, Stefano Pilati, who worked at Yves Saint Laurent in Paris for eight years before being let go after mixed reviews, will join Zegna on Jan. 1 as creative director. His mission will include building up the Agnona women’s brand.

Agnona, which had $38 million in revenue last year, a fraction of Zegna’s $1.42 billion in overall revenue, has a long way to go.

Hiring Mr. Pilati is meant to help the company extend its global reach, in competition with the luxury groups LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and PPR, the owner of Saint Laurent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997712969779968}",neutral,0.9997712969779968,0
Hermes complain against LVMH over stake building - LUXUO,"Thu, 06 Sep 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2hlcm1lcy1jb21wbGFpbi1hZ2FpbnN0LWx2bWgtb3Zlci1zdGFrZS1idWlsZGluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Style / Fashion

Hermes said Tuesday that it has filed a legal complaint over the manner in which luxury giant and rival LVMH bought a stake in the company in 2010.

Sep 06, 2012 | By AFPRelaxnews

Luxury retailer Hermes said Tuesday that it has filed a legal complaint over the manner in which luxury giant and rival LVMH bought a stake in the company in 2010.

“This complaint relates to the terms in which LVMH became a stakeholder in Hermes International,” Hermes said.



A judicial source said the complaint was for insider trading, collusion and price manipulation. It is still being studied by Paris prosecutors, the source said.

In a surprise move that riled members of the Hermes family, LVMH bought a 17-percent stake in the leather bag and silk scarf maker in 2010. That holding reached 22.28 percent by the end of May.

LVMH, which is controlled by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, said it is filing a countersuit.

The world’s leading luxury group said that its entry into Hermes’ capital was “perfectly legal” and that the accusations by Hermes are “completely without basis.”

Given that France’s AMF stock market regulator has not concluded its probe, LVMH said that Hermes’s actions were improper.

“Under these conditions, LVMH is obliged to file a countersuit for blackmail, false accusation and illegal competition,” it said in a statement.

Hermes family members changed the structure of the company into a holding, allowing them to fend off a hostile takeover from LVMH, and received court approval to do so without making a buyout offer to minority shareholders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9959726929664612}",neutral,0.9959726929664612,0
