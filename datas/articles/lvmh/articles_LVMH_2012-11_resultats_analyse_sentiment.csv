Top Balenciaga Designer Is Leaving the Company - The New York Times,"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsL3RvcC1kZXNpZ25lci1mb3ItYmFsZW5jaWFnYS10by1sZWF2ZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN FRANCISCO — In a surprising move reflecting the rivalry between two French luxury titans, PPR announced on Monday the departure of Balenciaga’s star designer, Nicolas Ghesquière.

Citing a “joint decision to end their partnership” François-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of PPR, praised Mr. Ghesquière’s “incomparable creative talent,” which “has brought to Balenciaga an artistic contribution essential to the unique influence of the house.”

Mr. Ghesquière, 41, who was not quoted in the PPR announcement, was traveling in Japan on Monday and could not be reached for comment. He joined Balenciaga when he was 25, was made creative director in 1997 and succeeded in bringing a hip and modern sensibility to the revered but dusty brand. His Balenciaga show for summer 2013 was widely applauded by critics and buyers.

The focus is now both on who will replace Mr. Ghesquière at a house that was extensively developed under his tenure — and on where he is headed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999030828475952}",neutral,0.9999030828475952,0
Moët & Chandon replaces Scarlett Johansson with Roger Federer - Campaign US,"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tb2V0LWNoYW5kb24tcmVwbGFjZXMtc2NhcmxldHQtam9oYW5zc29uLXJvZ2VyLWZlZGVyZXIvMTE2MjMzNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët & Chandon, which is owned by Louis Vuitton Hennessy (LVMH), announced details today of its deal with tennis star Federer.

Johansson signed a deal to be a brand ambassador for Moët & Chandon in 2009, but the pair are parting ways. The reasons behind the decision are unclear.

As its ambassador, Federer will take centre stage in the brand's upcoming advertising campaign.

Moët & Chandon told Marketing that the partnership is expected to go on for at least the next three to four years and that Federer will be ""a long-term friend of the House"".

Stephane Baschiera, president and chief executive of Moët & Chandon, said: ""Roger Federer personifies the glamour of achievement, great generosity and tremendous style values that have been key to our House throughout its long history.

""As the Champagne of victory and an enthusiastic supporter of major tennis tournaments around the world, we are extremely proud to welcome Roger Federer with Moët & Chandon’s hallmark hospitality.""

Federer said: ""It's more than just an honour to be Moët & Chandon's brand ambassador, it's an invitation to be part of a very glamorous tradition. Moët & Chandon has always been the Champagne of international trendsetters and I'm proud to be part of a brand that is as dedicated to the pursuit of excellence as I have been throughout my career.""

In 2010, LVMH reviewed the global digital strategy for its Moët & Chandon range, in a bid to boost its Champagne sales after the recession.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9629199504852295}",neutral,0.9629199504852295,0
L'Oréal strikes deal to buy Urban Decay - The Guardian,"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEyL25vdi8yNi9sb3JlYWwtYnV5cy11cmJhbi1kZWNhedIBRWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEyL25vdi8yNi9sb3JlYWwtYnV5cy11cmJhbi1kZWNheQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French beauty giant L'Oréal is attempting to raise its street cred with the acquisition of edgy makeup brand Urban Decay.

The financial details were not disclosed but it is thought L'Oréal paid $300-400m (£187-250m) for the California-based company, which is owned by private-equity firm Castanea Partners.

Urban Decay crashed on to the beauty scene in the mid-90s with eye-catching packaging and products with names like Stray Dog, an ash-brown eye-shadow, and the pale purple Asphyxia.

The deal will give L'Oréal another entry into the fast-growing area of specialist brands, which it says represents 44% of the luxury makeup market in the US.

Nicolas Hieronimus, the L'Oréal Luxe president, said: ""It is the makeup specialist we needed to fully satisfy young women in search of playful colours and inspiration, at an accessible price point.""

Urban Decay makeup is sold through specialist retailers, such as Sephora, or online shops, but this deal will extend its reach across the globe.

Tim Warner, the general manager of Urban Decay, said: ""L'Oréal's strong innovation capabilities and presence in every channel of distribution will enable Urban Decay to reach its full potential in the marketplace.""

French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Urban Decay in 2000, selling it to private equity three years later.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9907077550888062}",neutral,0.9907077550888062,0
LV To Lend its Monogram to Luxury Writing Instruments Too - iDiva.com,"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkaXZhLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwtbGl2aW5nL2hvbWUtZGVjb3IvbHYtdG8tbGVuZC1pdHMtbW9ub2dyYW0tdG8tbHV4dXJ5LXdyaXRpbmctaW5zdHJ1bWVudHMtdG9vLzE3NzY10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton is branching out into the manufacture of luxury pens and stationery, as the upmarket leather bag maker looks for new ways to retain its exclusive image, after it launched high-end jewellery and hired an expert to create a perfume.

The world's biggest luxury brand by sales, owned by LVMH, aims to start selling alligator-skin fountain pens, customised writing paper and brightly coloured inks in time for Christmas, industry sources close to the matter told Reuters.

LV Gets Competitive

Louis Vuitton, which like many of its luxury sector peers is facing slower growth in big markets such as China, will take on penmakers Montblanc and S.T. Dupont, albeit on a small scale at first.

Its new collection of leather goods such as pen holders and writing pads also means the brand will be invading the turf of Hermes, which has been trying to rebuff approaches from 22.6 percent-shareholder LVMH.

Louis Vuitton's sales, estimated by analysts at 6.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion), or more than double that of Gucci , the world's No.2 luxury brand, are forecast to reach 12 billion within 5-7 years. Its size and growth mean it must balance the need to retain its exclusive image with selling big volumes.

One analyst said the new luxury items—such as Baccarat crystal ink wells—combined with the fact that the range would initially only be sold in one shop, would help retain the brand's exclusive image.

Promotions & Distribution

The pens, stationery and luxury writing items will first be sold in a new outlet on the boulevard Saint-Germain in central Paris, an area which is increasingly being invaded by luxury brands like Burberry and Ralph Lauren, Emporio Armani and Berluti.

The site will first be used for art exhibitions and cultural events on writing and travel. It will later sell pens and stationery, one of the sources said, adding that Louis Vuitton also wanted to open similar shops dedicated to writing in Tokyo and New York.

Lagerfeld says Ghesquiere's own label is 'not a bad idea' - Times of Malta,"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL0xhZ2VyZmVsZC1zYXlzLUdoZXNxdWllcmUtcy1vd24tbGFiZWwtaXMtbm90LWEtYmFkLWlkZWEtLjQ0NjAxM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Star designer Karl Lagerfeld said the departure of Nicolas Ghesquiere from Balenciaga as artistic director to create his own brand with backing from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault would “not be a bad idea” as the group owned many old labels.

I am happy I can do both fashion and photography because there is a link between the two but it is a link which I refuse to analyse

“Perhaps Nicolas wants to have his own label, which is not a bad idea,” Lagerfeld told Reuters in an interview.

“And it would not be a bad idea if somebody such as Bernard Arnault would invest in a new label because there are so many old labels (within the LVMH group),” Lagerfeld said about the chief executive of the world’s biggest luxury group.

PPR, the French group which owns Balenciaga, shocked the fashion world by announcing recently the departure of Ghesquiere, who had been with the brand since 1997 and was the main architect of its revival.

The International Herald Tribune reported that one option for Ghesquiere was to create his own brand with the backing of Arnault, who controls LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, which owns many fashion brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Celine.

Founded by Cristobal Balenciaga in 1919, his eponymous brand thrived until the late 1960s and then lay dormant until Ghesquiere took over as designer. The brand started to expand worldwide after PPR acquired it in 2001.

Balenciaga did not explain Ghesquiere’s departure clearly when it made the announcement on November 5 but it suggested the designer was longing for a new creative adventure.

Lagerfeld, who runs his own brand on top of working as artistic director for LVMH’s Fendi and for privately owned Chanel, said he could not think about the succession.

“We (my team and I) only think in terms of one collection after the next collection,” he said. “In fashion, I am very much against projection in the far away future.”

Lagerfeld was speaking at the opening of an exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris of his photos of celebrities themed around Chanel’s “little black jacket,” who were styled by Carine Roitfeld, former editor of French Vogue.

The celebrities include artist Yoko Ono, John Lennon’s widow, film-maker Sofia Coppola and actresses Kirsten Dunst and Milla Jojovich.

“I am happy I can do both fashion and photography because there is a link between the two but it is a link which I refuse to analyse,” Lagerfeld said.

Also present at the exhibition’s opening was Bruno Pavlovsky, president of Chanel’s fashion division, who like Lagerfeld would not be drawn too long on the subject of the designer’s succession.

“Karl is in great shape, I work every day with him and I can assure you that he is doing very well,” Pavlovsky said, adding that relations between Chanel and him had always been excellent.

“Of course one day there will be an after-Karl but Karl will have made Chanel so strong, with such strong codes that Chanel will find solutions,” Pavlovsky said.

The executive said Chanel, owned by the Wertheimer family, was doing well overall and expected 2012 to be another “good year” in spite of the global downturn which has affected many of its rivals including LVMH, Burberry and Gucci owner PPR.

However, he said the Chinese market was becoming more mature with growth levels in big cities such as Shanghai or Beijing becoming similar to that of European capitals or New York where Chanel has been for decades.

“We are no longer in the 20-30 per cent growth levels we had seen (in previous years in China),” he said. “It can be more than 10 per cent,” he said, referring to growth levels in big European cities.

Pavlovsky said Chanel planned to finish the year with 10 boutiques in China and 182 globally.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999710321426392}",neutral,0.9999710321426392,0
"Bags, bags, bags - Crafted from recycled material | Flair - Jamaica Gleaner","Mon, 05 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9nbGVhbmVyLzIwMTIxMTA1L2ZsYWlyL2ZsYWlyOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS (AP):

Ilaria Venturini Fendi has translated the same attention to detail and craftsmanship she learned working over the years in her famous family's Italian fashion business to her own line of bags that feature repurposed items, including everything from old light switch plates to leather seats from cars once used in crash tests.

""What I did was simply to add my already existing know-how I had from my family to my new vision of the fashion industry,"" said Venturini Fendi, who was in Dallas last week as part of an Italian Fashion Week featuring runway shows and receptions that also included an Italian Fashion Expo at the Dallas Market Center with more than 100 Italian designers, including Venturini Fendi, showcasing their collections.

Her Carmina Campus bags are each different, made from ""only reusable materials, or unused but out of production, which give a second life"".

As Venturini Fendi puts it, she ""grew up in fashion"". Her grandparents, Edoardo and Adele Fendi, founded the Rome-based design house in 1925. The house was then inherited by the five Fendi sisters, including Venturini Fendi's mother Anna, before being taken over in 2001 by French conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH).

creative director

Venturini Fendi spent two years working for Chanel in Paris before going to work for the family business, where she spent about two decades. She worked as a shoe designer and as creative director for the Fendissime line, and continued to work there for several years after LVMH took over.

Eventually, though, she had the desire to do something different. She left the family company and bought a farm in northern Rome.

""My dream since I was a young girl was to live with nature and to work surrounded by nature, so the first thing I did was to buy a farm,"" she said.

As she worked on her farm filled with sheep, horses, pigs, goats and hens she began to feel her original passion for fashion re-emerging. Then, after designing bags to raise money for a group aimed at stopping female genital mutilation, she began to develop the idea of resuming her career in fashion, but in a ""different way"".

In 2006, Carmina Campus was born, which translates from Latin to ""chants of the fields"".

Working with repurposed items, she said, made her look at the way she designed much differently. Where before she would start with a sketch of what she had in mind and then search out the materials, now she finds the materials first and creates the designs around those.

""The creative process changed tremendously,"" she said.

In collaboration with the Mini car company, she used materials from cars used in crash tests, incorporating seat belts, handles and even visors, which can be flipped up when affixed to the outside of a purse to create a handy make-up mirror.

Another group of bags have been constructed from trash bags with accents made from the bottoms of aluminium cans. Leather samples are also made into bags, complete with the stamp indicating the sample's color intact. For other bags she's incorporated old light-switch plates. Her purses also feature old military blankets and disused tents.

She also has a line of bags that is made in Africa with locally reclaimed materials in collaboration with the International Trade Centre, a joint United Nations and World Trade Organisation agency that fights poverty with trade-driven projects that employ local workers. The line's motto, which can also be seen on some of the bags, is 'Not Charity, Just Work'.

designs furniture, jewellery

Venturini Fendi, who also designs furniture and jewellery from repurposed items, including earrings that incorporate the plastic hands from dolls, has a flagship store near Rome's Spanish Steps. Her Carmina Campus line can also be found in boutiques, on the online luxury fashion website yoox.com and in the Japanese department store chain Takashimaya.

Italian Fashion Week in Dallas - a collaboration between Italian Expo.us, which puts on trade and consumer events in the US, and the Italian American Chamber of Commerce-Midwest - was designed to introduce area industry professionals to a variety of Italian designers. At one reception during the festivities, the chamber recognised Venturini Fendi for excellence in ethical business.

Maurizio Muzzetta, president of Italian Expo.us, said that Venturini Fendi is ""an example of how fashion can be"".

This is the second year that the Italian fashion festivities have been held in Dallas, and they expect to continue for at least the next five years. Fulvio Calcinardi, executive director of the Italian American Chamber of Commerce-Midwest, said that many Italian companies have focused on New York and Los Angeles, but that these events help promote the designers in a new market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

Roger Federer Signs $30 Million Champagne Deal - Celebrity Net Worth,"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbGVicml0eW5ldHdvcnRoLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jZWxlYnJpdHkvcm9nZXItZmVkZXJlci1zaWducy0zMC1taWxsaW9uLWNoYW1wYWduZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Roger Federer Signs $30 Million Champagne Deal

Roger Federer just signed a five year, $30 million endorsement deal with French champagne maker Moet & Chandon. Thank God, because if there's one guy out there who needs more money, it's Roger Federer. I bet after Federer signed the deal he celebrated by cracking open a cold can of beer. Or maybe he dumped a bottle of Gatorade over his agent's head. He probably just treated himself to a nice tall glass of chocolate milk. All kidding aside, this deal represents another extremely high quality sponsor for Federer and I'm certain the deal was celebrated by spraying plenty of the bubbly…

Federer replaces Scarlett Johansson as Moet's global brand ambassador in ad campaigns that will begin appearing in March 2013. In a video press release, Federer noted that he felt honored to be working with such a ""traditional and glamorous brand"". The 17 time Grand Slam winner also said ""working with such a prestigious brand is a dream come true"".

Moet & Chandon joins a long and enviable list of Federer sponsors. Federer already brings home north of $50 million per year, of which only $8.5 million comes from tournament prize money. The other $41.5 million comes from one of the most impressive sponsorship portfolios in professional sports. Federer has endorsement deals with Rolex, Mercedes-Benz, Nike, Wilson rackets, Lindt Chocolates, Gillette razors, Credit Suisse and NetJets. His Nike deal alone is worth $10 million a year. Federer is the fifth highest paid athlete in the world behind LeBron James ($53 million), Tiger Woods ($60 million), Manny Pacquiao ($62 million) and Floyd Mayweather ($85 million).

Moet & Chandon is one of the oldest and most prestigious champagne makers in the world. Founded in 1743 by Claude Moet, today the company employs over 1700 people and has annual revenues of $1.5 billion. They produce 26 million bottles of champagne per year. Moet has a Royal warrant to be the official champagne supplier to Queen Elizabeth II of England. In addition to Moet & Chandon, the company also produces Domaine Chandon and the ever prestigious Dom Perignon brands. Outside of the wine making world, Moet & Chandon also co-owns luxury goods company LVMH Moët Hennessy. Headed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, LVMH employees nearly 90,000 people and earns more than $30 billion a year off brands such as Bulgari, Donna Karan, Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Tag Heurer, Thomas Pink, Veuve Clicquot and many more.

Congrats again to Roger Federer, we'll remember to pour out a lil Moet this weekend for fallen sponsor Scarlett Johansson…","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997664093971252}",neutral,0.9997664093971252,0
