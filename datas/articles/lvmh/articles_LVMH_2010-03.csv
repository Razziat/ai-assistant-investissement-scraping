E.U. Court Curbs Sales by Google of Brand Names as Keywords - BlueRidgeNow.com,"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsdWVyaWRnZW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDEwLzAzLzI0L2UtdS1jb3VydC1jdXJicy1zYWxlcy8yODIzOTU2MDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"E.U. Court Curbs Sales by Google of Brand Names as Keywords

PARIS — The European Union’s highest court on Tuesday gave Google broad latitude to sell advertising linked to trademarks like Louis Vuitton on its search engine, a practice that angers companies, which fear a loss of control over their brand names.

Legal experts said, however, that the ruling stopped short of the definitive precedent that Google and brand owners alike had sought. Instead, it contained caveats that could result in a new flurry of lawsuits over the sale of “sponsored links” generated by Google searches, the main source of the company’s $23 billion in annual revenue.

In the ruling, the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, said Google should be allowed to auction off brand names to a variety of advertisers, not just the owners of the trademarks. Brand owners, led by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods company, argued that only they or authorized sites should be able to buy such trademarks.

Google already conducts such sales in the United States and some European countries, including Britain and Ireland. But elsewhere in Europe, including France, the practice has been restricted by the courts, which have favored the brand owners.

Google says that selling brand names as ad keywords to multiple bidders helps consumers because it allows them to find product reviews, sellers of second-hand goods and other information.

“Our guiding principle has always been that advertising should benefit users, and our aim is to ensure that ads are relevant and useful,” Google said.

But LVMH and two other companies whose cases were considered by the court — a matchmaking service and an online travel agency — argued that the sale of their brand names by Google misled consumers and aided operators of Web sites selling copies of well-known goods and services. So important did LVMH consider the case that it enlisted the support of the French government, which filed a brief in support of its case.

The ruling Tuesday was the highest-level decision on the issue. While Google had faced similar lawsuits in the United States, it settled some of them, and no clear precedents were established. In France, after several decisions in favor of LVMH, Google appealed to the highest French court, which in turn referred questions to the European court for clarification.

The top E.U. court said Google should not be held liable for trademark infringement if it removed ads promptly when brand owners complained about violations. But individual advertisers could be liable if ads generated by another company’s brand name were found to mislead consumers, the court said.

Advertisers “cannot, by using such keywords, arrange for Google to display ads which do not allow Internet users easily to establish from which undertaking the goods or services covered by the ad in question originate,” the court said.

Lawyers said this could strengthen brand owners’ hand in lawsuits against rivals that buy their brands as search terms.

“Advertisers using the service will now need to tread very carefully indeed,” said Mark Blair, a partner at Marks & Clerk Solicitors in London. “Today’s ruling may to an extent ring-fence Google from claims by brand owners, but it will not close the door on future litigation in this area.”

Several trademark lawsuits against users of Google’s search-ad system are already pending in Europe, including one involving the florists’ network Interflora, which sued the British retailer Marks & Spencer. That company had bought the Interflora keyword on Google as a way to promote its rival flower delivery service.

The E.U. court said Google, too, could be held liable if it were found to have encouraged trademark violations or counterfeiting.

For example, Google critics have complained about one of the company’s services, which suggests potential keywords to advertisers. LVMH said in its lawsuit that these included terms like “fake Louis Vuitton bags.”

Google says, however, that it takes an active role in fighting counterfeiting, taking down links to sites selling fakes when it is notified. In some countries, it also bars advertisers from using rivals’ brand names in the actual text of search ads, even if it allows the sale of those trademarks as keywords.

The Court of Justice said national courts in the 27 E.U. member countries should, in effect, decide whether Google acts in good faith on such issues, potentially dragging out litigation for many years.

In the meantime, the threat of lawsuits by brand owners could make some advertisers warier about buying rivals’ brand names on AdWords, Google’s search advertising system, lawyers said. As a result, Google might not see any surge in revenue, even if it decides to expand its policy on selling branded keywords in countries like France, they added.

“This is likely to make it less attractive to bid on famous brands and should mean that prices of many AdWords, and the revenues from them to Google, drop,” said Andy Millmore, head of litigation at the law firm of Harbottle & Lewis in London.

That helps explain why both sides claimed victory after the decision. Brand owners have complained that Google’s practice drives up the cost of acquiring their own keywords.

“This long-awaited decision will be welcomed by the business community as well as by consumers,” LVMH said. “It confirms and emphasizes the critical role played by trademarks in a dynamic economy to protect innovation and the investments carried out by businesses, and will avoid confusion on behalf of consumers as to the quality of the products and services they are buying.”

LVMH said it planned to speak with Google about the possibility of creating a filter to root out ads that violate trademarks before they are displayed as sponsored links. The company said it planned to continue advertising on Google’s search engine, where it spends millions of euros a year.

“Google for us is a partner more than an adversary,” Pierre Godé, an LVMH director and adviser to the chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said during a conference call. “We have no desire to create a forum where we battle with Google eternally for the world’s amusement.”

In the meantime, said Jason Rawkins, a partner at the law firm of Taylor Wessing in London, “it’s down to the brand owners to continue to police this, which will put a considerable financial burden on them.”"
Google Wins Legal Battle Over AdWords Trademark Issue In Europe - Search Engine Land,"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vc2VhcmNoZW5naW5lbGFuZC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLXdpbnMtbWFqb3ItbGVnYWwtYmF0dGxlLW92ZXItYWR3b3Jkcy10cmFkZW1hcmstaXNzdWUtaW4tZXVyb3BlLTM4NjI40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European luxury goods maker LVMH (Luis Vuitton) sued Google in France over its AdWords policy allowing third parties, including LVMH competitors, to bid on its trademarked terms as keywords. The case originally arose when marketers bid on “Louis Vuitton” and turned out to be selling counterfeit Louis Vuitton items.

The company won in France’s highest court, even as Google was liberalizing its AdWords policy in Europe to conform to the more permissive US policy that routinely allows such third party trademark-keyword bidding. (Trademarks cannot appear in competitors’ ad copy however.) Google appealed to the pan-EU European Court of Justice.

Update: see postscript 2 below for qualifiers.

An affirmation of the French court’s ruling would have meant potentially big changes for Google (and SEM more generally) and the reinstatement of separate AdWords policies and systems for the US and Europe. Before the court were the following questions:

Whether bidding by third parties and competitors on trademarked keywords violated European trademark law

Whether Google AdWords were “covered by the European Union’s e-commerce law,” which protects ISPs from trademark or copyright violations unless or until those violations are brought to the attention of the service provider

According to a Google Blog post just published Google has prevailed on both questions:

Today, the Court confirmed that Google has not infringed trade mark law by allowing advertisers to bid for keywords corresponding to their competitors’ trade marks. It also confirmed that European law that protects internet hosting services applies to Google’s AdWords advertising system. This is important because it is a fundamental principle behind the free flow of information over the internet.

Google can thus breathe a sigh of relief and scratch a major case off the list in its favor. Still, many legal headaches for Google remain in both the US and Europe. Law professor Eric Goldman lays out many of those in a blog post from yesterday.

Meanwhile Foundem, one of the European anti-trust complainants against Google, says it is “confident” that the European Commision will launch a formal investigation in the near future. Right now the EC is proceeding with a more informal inquiry into complaints lodged by Foundem, French site ejustice.fr and Microsoft-owned shopping engine Ciao.

Postscript: TechCrunch originally incorrectly reported the opposite outcome:

Keyword advertising using the trademark of others without their permission is illegal and services providers such as Google are also liable for any infringement. That’s the ruling given today by the The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), in a move that will likely shake up the search-based online industry. The fact that Google et al can no longer claim safe harbour in Europe is particularly significant as it now firmly places the burden of enforcement on service providers. The case being settled, which now sets the precedent in Europe, is LVMH, the luxury goods company behind such brands as Dom Perignon, VS Google. The dispute had been referred to the European Court of Justice by The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) who asked the European court to decide on the rules governing trademark law online as well as the liability of providers of a paid referencing service – in this case Google.

Commenting on the ruling, LVMH is obviously delighted.

The court itself, in its press release, said the following: “Google has not infringed trade mark law by allowing advertisers to purchase keywords corresponding to their competitors’ trade marks.” Individual advertisers, however, may be held liable for infringement the court ruled.

There were also questions remanded to the lower French court for determination.

Postscript 2: There’s a bit more nuance here that it originally appeared. Google reported that it had won in a relatively unqualified way. I searched unsuccessfully for the court’s actual opinion and ruling but was unable to find it.

Parties using AdWords may still sue each other if there’s an alleged trademark violation. And once Google is notified of a violation, apparently, duties kick in — much like copyright claims for unauthorized use of video in the US on YouTube for example. In such cases Google removes the video at the copyright owners behest and request. If it fails to comply with these requests Google could be liable.

In addition Google does have some alternative vulnerability to lawsuits if its practices are found to have “encouraged” wrongful use of trademarks. The New York Times explains:

Google could also be liable if its business practices were found to encourage trademark violations, the court ruled. For example, Google critics have complained about one of the company’s services, which suggests potential keywords to advertisers, including terms like “imitation handbags,” which brand owners say encourage the sale of counterfeit goods.

There’s a fair amount of ambiguity here at a practical level that could result in new lawsuits between AdWords advertisers, who in turn might name Google as a defendant under one of the theories above. Presumably Google would use this court’s decision as a shield in such cases assuming it could prove it complied with takedown notices and so on. However, mostly, Google has dodged a bullet it appears.

Postscript 3: Law professor Eric Goldman does a more thorough legal analysis of the decision and wonders if it’s something of a “hollow victory” for Google."

Google wins Louis Vuitton trademark case - The Guardian,"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDEwL21hci8yMy9nb29nbGUtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zZWFyY2gtYWRz0gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTAvbWFyLzIzL2dvb2dsZS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXNlYXJjaC1hZHM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European court of justice today ruled in favour of Google in a long-running court battle with Louis Vuitton over the use of the luxury goods company's trademarked brand names in search advertising.

However, the ECJ added the caveat that companies that use trademarked brand keywords to push sales must be more transparent about who the seller is.

Louis Vuitton, which is part of the LVMH group of brands including Moet & Chandon and Dior, had argued that Google was acting illegally by allowing other companies to bid for and use its brand names as keywords to trigger ads on its website.

Lawyers had viewed the legal battle, which has been going on for years, as potentially critical to Google as the search engine giant's business model has been built on the back of its AdWords system.

""Google has not infringed trademark law by allowing advertisers to purchase keywords corresponding to their competitors' trademarks,"" said the ECJ today.

""Advertisers themselves, however, cannot, by using such keywords, arrange for Google to display ads which do not allow internet users easily to establish from which undertaking the goods or services covered by the ad in question originate,"" added the ECJ.

The ECJ added that France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation, will have the final say on a ""case by case basis"" on whether there is an ""adverse effect, or a risk thereof, on the function of indicating origin"".

The court also said that the decision on whether Google is liable over client data it stores on its servers – in effect a judgment on whether it has controls over the content of ads – should be left to the French courts.

If Google is found to have a ""neutral"" role, that it is merely ""technical, automatic and passive pointing to a lack of knowledge or control of data"", then it cannot be held liable, the ECJ added.

Google cautiously welcomed the ECJ ruling, and said it was in the best interests of consumers not to have certain keywords blocked from use by advertisers.

""We believe that user interest is best served by maximizing the choice of keywords, ensuring relevant and informative advertising for a wide variety of different contexts,"" said Dr Harjinder Obhi, senior litigation counsel for Google in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, on the official Google blog.

""Some companies want to limit choice for users by extending trade mark law to encompass the use of keywords in online advertising. Ultimately they want to be able to exercise greater control over the information available to users by preventing other companies from advertising when a user enters their trademark as a search query. In other words, controlling and restricting the amount of information that users may see in response to their searches,"" Dr Obhi added.

Pierre Gode, senior executive vice president at LVMH, said: ""This decision represents a critical step towards the clarification of the rules governing online advertising, of which LVMH is one of the foremost clients.

""As the world's leading luxury group, with more brands actively engaged with the internet than any other luxury company, we are committed to working with all parties, including Google, to eradicate illicit online practices and to promote a framework that fosters the continued growth of the digital economy.""

Google used to block advertisers from buying others' brand names as keywords but changed its policy in North America in 2004 and four years later extended that to Britain and Ireland.

Last September an interim legal opinion delivered by the ECJ said Google had not infringed trademark rights by allowing advertisers to buy keywords corresponding to registered trademarks.

Fiona McBride, trademark lawyer at Withers & Rogers, described the ECJ ruling about the origin of an ad as ""perplexing"". She said it seemed to be unnecessarily introducing ""a requirement of element or doubt as to the origin of goods and services which is not relevant for determining the infringement of a registered trademark"".

""This is a setback for brand owners and seriously limits the scope of their trade mark rights when it comes to challenging use of their trade marks in online advertising,"" added McBride. ""Only rarely will the internet user be unable to ascertain the origin of the goods and services and it will therefore be easy for advertisers to circumvent the law and use third party trade marks as keywords. This means that advertisers can secure a commercial advantage by piggy-backing on the reputation of the trademarks.""
