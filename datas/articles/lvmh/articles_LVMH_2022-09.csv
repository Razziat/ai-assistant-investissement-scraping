Michael Schriver promoted to LVMH Group President North Asia - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9taWNoYWVsLXNjaHJpdmVyLXByb21vdGVkLXRvLWx2bWgtZ3JvdXAtcHJlc2lkZW50LW5vcnRoLWFzaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Group has named Michael Schriver as LVMH Group President North Asia, effective immediately.

Schriver, for many years one of DFS Group’s most senior executives, has been Louis Vuitton President North Asia since September 2014.

Prior to that he was Chief Operating Officer at DFS, a position he had held since July 2012, having joined the travel retailer in 1998.

LVMH Group Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault delivered a ringing personal endorsement of the appointment. “I am delighted about Michael’s nomination. It is a strong signal of our determination to invest in our future in Asia and to enhance collaboration across our organisation,” he said.

“I have been working with Michael for over 20 years and have been constantly impressed with his understanding of the business at all levels. I will stay in close contact with him in his new role. His expertise, and the knowledge of the group ecosystem and culture will be strong assets for us.”

LVMH said, “Michael will bring unique value to this role thanks to his 24 years’ of experience in operating across the Asian markets, including key leadership roles at DFS and more recently at Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.

“He has lived through the rapid growth and transformation of Asia over the years, and developed an intimate understanding of the consumer, the distribution, and the broader business environment.”"
What LVMH's North Asia Group President Appointment Means For China - Jing Daily,"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLW5vcnRoLWFzaWEtZ3JvdXAtcHJlc2lkZW50LWFwcG9pbnRtZW50LWNoaW5hLWx1eHVyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Luxury conglomerate LVMH has appointed Michael Schriver, a veteran of the luxury industry, as group president of North Asia. Schriver will oversee the markets of China and South Korea, while the respective presidents — Andrew Wu of Greater China and Hyun Ouk Cho of South Korea — will now report directly to him.

Michael Schriver has over 24 years of experience in operating across Asian markets. Previously, he worked for DFS, LVMH’s duty-free retail component, for 16 years and held the role of chief operating officer. Since 2014, he has had the title of Louis Vuitton North Asia President.

The Jing Take

The appointment comes at a challenging time for companies operating in the region. Strict COVID-19 policies and lockdown measures have made the Chinese market unpredictable. This has added to the instability following a number of global issues such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation, and supply chain disruption.

Brands have been dealing with the above in different ways, from devising new roles, pulling out, reducing brick-and-mortar stores, and debuting on online marketplaces like Tmall and JD.com. In May, Swiss luxury group Richemont, the parent company of Cartier, warned of a slow China recovery — showing less optimism for the market.

In contrast, LVMH’s confidence in local shoppers has not been dampened by the uneven recovery. Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, stated that the appointment is “a strong signal of our determination to invest in our future in Asia and to enhance collaboration across our organization.” For instance, Louis Vuitton is planning a “spin-off” runway at Aranya Gold Coast — the mainland’s favorite elite resort, which is a two-hour train ride from Beijing — for its Spring 2023 menswear collection on September 16.

LVMH is not alone in giving more power to regional teams to create localized strategies. This year, Kering has also set up a new position: President of Greater China for Gucci. It will be filled by Laurent Cathala (former Tiffany’s North Asia President), who will report directly to Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri, bypassing the Asia-Pacific President. The decentralization strategy allows for more targeted marketing activities, faster reaction times to consumers, and timely footprint expansion in promising lower-tier cities.

With the country set to become the largest luxury market by 2025, more high-end groups and labels are likely to follow suit. The current challenges are severe — but only temporary.

LVMH Appoints Michael Schriver as Group President for North Asia - WWD,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLW5hbWVzLW1pY2hhZWwtc2Nocml2ZXItZ3JvdXAtcHJlc2lkZW50LW5vcnRoLWFzaWEtMTIzNTMwOTg0NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Michael Schriver has been named group president of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in North Asia, effective immediately.

The French luxury conglomerate announced the nomination on LinkedIn, saying that the executive would leverage his 24 years of experience in operating across Asian markets, including key leadership roles at DFS and more recently at Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.

“I am delighted of Michael’s nomination. It is a strong signal of our determination to invest in our future in Asia and to enhance collaboration across our organization,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH.

“I have been working with Michael for over 20 years and have been constantly impressed with his understanding of the business at all levels. I will stay in close contact with him in his new role. His expertise, and the knowledge of the group ecosystem and culture will be strong assets for us,” he added.

Schriver takes on the role at a challenging time for the region, where business remains hampered by lockdowns designed to curb the spread of COVID-19. He was president of Louis Vuitton in North Asia since 2014, and prior to that spent 16 years with duty-free retailer DFS, holding roles including chief operating officer.

China’s poor performance dragged down LVMH’s revenues in Asia in the second quarter, which fell 8 percent after a rise of 8 percent in the prior three months. In his new role, a newly created position, Schriver will be responsible for all the group’s operations in Greater China and South Korea.

“These markets already represent a sizeable part of the group business. They hold enormous potential for our brands in the future. It is a very good time to take a high-level view of our business, and to draw the strategies that will guide our development. This is even more true given the difficulties of traveling to these geographies at this time,” LVMH said in an internal memo.

Andrew Wu, LVMH president Greater China, and Ouk Cho, LVMH president South Korea, will both continue in their roles and will report to Schriver. He will also work in close collaboration with Roula Rozakeas, LVMH’s senior vice president human resources for Asia Pacific, who will concentrate her efforts on North Asia."
Case Study | Inside the $7 Billion Dior Phenomenon - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vY2FzZS1zdHVkaWVzL2x1eHVyeS9jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGlvci1zdHJhdGVneS1sdm1oLXBpZXRyby1iZWNjYXJpLW1hcmlhLWdyYXppYS1jaGl1cmkta2ltLWpvbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 1947, mere months after its founding, Christian Dior Couture revolutionised women’s dressing with its post-war “New Look,” securing a place at the pinnacle of French fashion. Later, Dior became the cornerstone of the luxury empire of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who has invested in the house with a “sky’s the limit” approach since the 1980s. But for many years, Dior’s brand, one of modern luxury’s most famous and prestigious marks, remained bigger than its business.

In 2017, LVMH took full control of Christian Dior, kicking off a series of moves that would radically accelerate the business. Under new chief executive Pietro Beccari and designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones, Dior’s business has grown rapidly, with sales roughly tripling since the deal. Its newfound scale has created a virtuous cycle, allowing it to invest even more in spectacular runway shows and sprawling boutiques, all while multiplying estimated profits by a factor of seven. As Dior edges closer to overtaking its historic rival, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca dubbed it “a homegrown Chanel within LVMH.”

This case study examines how Dior became one of luxury fashion’s fastest-growing and most profitable businesses. The company overhauled its product offer and communications: extending a culture of couture craftsmanship and innovation which had long animated its theatrical runway collections, and applying them throughout its commercial lines to create a diversified menu of hit products. The company also raced into e-commerce, rapidly extending its reach beyond the shopping capitals where it operates stores, and rolled out immersive, spectacular flagships to serve as a destination for a broad range of brand devotees, from aspirational tourists to top-spending “VICs.” As the coronavirus hammered sales for most fashion companies, Dior leaned into its momentum by continuing to stage major marketing moments that engaged homebound consumers watching online and fuelled post-pandemic growth.

The strategy appears to be paying off: Dior has rapidly scaled from around €2.2 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue in 2017 to €6.6 billion in 2021, according to estimates, with the strong growth putting it closer than ever to overtaking mega-brand rivals like Gucci, Hermès or even luxury titan Chanel. With an operating margin above 35 percent of sales, the brand is likely now the fourth most-profitable listed luxury fashion brand, after LVMH stablemate Louis Vuitton, Kering’s Gucci and Hermès.

Harlem's Fashion Row and LVMH Kicked Off New York Fashion Week With a Ceremony Honoring Black Creatives ... - EBONY,"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:37:29 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVib255LmNvbS9oYXJsZW1zLWZhc2hpb24tcm93LWFuZC1sdm1oLWtpY2tlZC1vZmYtbmV3LXlvcmstZmFzaGlvbi13ZWVrLXdpdGgtYS1jZXJlbW9ueS1ob25vcmluZy1ibGFjay1jcmVhdGl2ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Though New York Fashion Week officially starts on Friday, September 9, Harlem’s Fashion Row (HFR) kicked it off early last night.

For its 15th anniversary, HFR held its fashion show and Style Awards ceremony at the General Grant National Memorial in Harlem, with LVMH, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton as the title sponsor for the event. This year’s theme “Future’s Past” showcased the untold history of the countless contributions, sacrifices and innovations in a fashion that continue to elevate Black-owned brands.

The ceremony began with The Virgil Abloh Award, presented by LVMH, to the incomparable actress, writer and producer Issa Rae. Sergio Hudson, the luxury women's wear designer received the Designer of the Year award. Renowned fashion critic, editor and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Robin Givhan received the Editor of the Year award. Celebrity stylist Ade Samuel, whose fashion resumé is as long as a CVS receipt, received the Stylist of the Year award. And the legendary Janet Jackson—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—received the Icon of the Year award.

The award ceremony wrapped with Louis Vuitton Americas bestowing the Harlem’s Fashion Row ICON 360 grants to the three designers who presented their collections during the evening's fashion show slate: men's wear designer and winner of the HFR x Tommy Hilfiger Design Competition Clarence Ruth; women's wear Johnathan Hayden; and women's wear Nicole Benefield. Each designer was assigned an executive mentor from Louis Vuitton Americas to guide and support their growth.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Cuts Energy Use 10 Percent - WWD,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLWVuZXJneS1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tcGxhbi11a3JhaW5lLXdhci0xMjM1MzMyOTE0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – As Europe tightens its energy belt, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has revealed plans to reduce electricity use by 10 percent across the group.

Antoine Arnault, LVMH head of image and environment, told WWD the move is in line with the company’s long-term values.

“Although our group is a low energy consumer, we are aware of the visibility and the impact our decisions can have in leading the way for others. This energy efficiency plan represents an unprecedented effort that we hope will have a virtuous effect on the entire sector and beyond,” he said. “We are acting today in a very concrete way to respond to the unprecedented energy crisis before us.”

The parent company of Celine, Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe and Louis Vuitton, among others, will cut its consumption by turning off the lights across all of its stores between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Administrative offices will call for lights out at 9 p.m.

The group will also lower the heating by 1 degree Celsius in all stores this winter, and keep air conditioning 1 degree Celsius higher in the coming summer, to reach French government targets.

“Following the call of the president of the French Republic and the French government, LVMH announces an energy efficiency plan in order to make a concrete and immediate contribution to the national effort,” the company added in a statement.

On Sept. 5, French President Emmanuel Macron rallied the country and called for a 10 percent reduction in energy use as the EU grapples with supply issues following the shutdown of Russian gas pipelines over the war in Ukraine, as well as lower power-plant output following this summer’s unprecedented drought. Macron urged businesses to save energy by turning down heating and air conditioning and called for a new age of “energy sobriety.”

Since every kilowatt counts, LVMH will also launch an awareness campaign for employees to turn off lights and screens, as well as unplug other electronics. The program will begin in France, where LVMH has 34,000 employees, before being rolled out worldwide.

Individual brands will be able to set additional targets. Champagne and spirits house Moët Hennessy has set an internal target of a 15 percent reduction worldwide by 2023, the company noted.

In France, the company currently uses enough megawatts to power the mid-sized city of Dijon for a year, and credits all of that to green sources. Globally, renewable energy use is at 39 percent, while its Life 360 sustainability plan aims to make that 100 percent renewable or low-carbon by 2026.

Arnault has been key in spearheading the group’s sustainability policy, including the Life 360 plan. A report issued in 2021 calculated its carbon footprint at 4.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent, with a greenhouse gas reduction goal of 50 percent by 2026, compared to a baseline from 2019, by using renewable energy, and cutting Scope 3 emissions by roughly half in the next 10 years.

“We have always had an ambitious environmental policy and this new commitment advances the timeline of one of our Life 360 objectives. This energy-efficiency plan is aligned with our long-standing vision: more than an obligation, preserving the environment is an imperative. We do not have the luxury of waiting,” Arnault said.

The move makes LVMH the first major luxury player to heed Macron’s call to action. The groupwide effort is a major undertaking for the luxury conglomerate, which oversees 75 maisons across six sectors including fashion and leather goods, watches and jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics, wines and spirits as well as hotels and specialty retailers.

The company was also an early actor during the COVID-19 shutdowns, when it shifted fragrance factories to producing hand gel, and shut down its stores in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Arnault said the company tries to act quickly in the face of “extraordinary events.”

“It is our duty to be exemplary in our operations,” Arnault added.

France’s energy crunch and accompanying price spikes of up to 25 percent have led to some energy-intensive industries such as steel and glass to scale down production or temporarily close as they head into winter.

As part of the nationwide energy reduction efforts, even the Eiffel Tower will also go dark more than an hour earlier, shutting off its sparkling lights at 11:45 p.m."

LVMH said 27,000 of its staff in France would be able to qualify for this bonus, which would range from €1,000-1,500 ($973.50-$1,460).

Earlier this month, Air France and Stellantis also announced similar bonuses for workers, as inflation rises across Europe.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted world energy markets, and this in turn has contributed to rising inflation.

The move to reinforce its leadership in the region comes amid an uneven recovery from coronavirus, with health restrictions including sporadic strict lockdowns making the key Chinese market unpredictable and tricky for brands to navigate. LVMH’s sales in Asia (excluding Japan), rose just 1 percent in the first half of the year.

Schriver has previously worked as President, North Asia at LVMH flagship Louis Vuitton and as Chief Operating Officer of tax-free retailer DFS.

Stella McCartney and LVMH announce the launch of a new beauty brand - Premium beauty,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9zdGVsbGEtbWNjYXJ0bmV5LWFuZC1sdm1oLWFubm91bmNlLDIwNzM30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following a successful partnership with LVMH which began in 2019, Stella McCartney has collaborated with the LVMH Beauty division to develop her new skincare line, STELLA by Stella McCartney.

Conscious luxury skincare line

After pioneering the conscious luxury fashion industry, Stella’s ambition is to offer an alternative to luxury skincare. Dubbed “Alter-Care™”, the concept is based on “an approach that supports caring for ourselves and Mother Earth in perfect harmony” with the aim to combine nature, efficiency, and responsibility.

If the idea, in itself, is not wildly innovative, its credibility rests on the personality of the designer, who is well known for her vegan and cruelty-free activism.

“I am delighted that Stella McCartney, after pioneering a sustainable and responsible luxury fashion, is now partnering with LVMH, committed to change the codes of cosmetics, the packaging and the ingredients. The launch of STELLA by Stella McCartney perfectly resonates with the Group’s longstanding commitment toward sustainability and we are proud to support it,” said Antoine Arnault, Image & Environment, LVMH.

“We set out with an idea, and because we didn’t want to compromise – on outstanding results, the origin of our ingredients, and, of course, ensuring we minimised our impact on Mother Earth – we kept on trying. We worked hard for almost three years with LVMH constantly evolving and aiming for what I felt was possible: rooted in nature, truly effective and responsible skincare,” added the designer.

Minimalism

Based on Stella McCartney’s personal philosophy of using ‘only what you need’, the range consists of three essential products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream.

Offering “impressive clinically-proven results”, in the words of LVMH, the new range has been formulated and challenged to minimise its footprint at each stage of the product lifecycle: from the ingredients to the packaging, to operations all the way through to consumer usage. All product formulas are made with at least 99% natural-origin ingredients, and each is available in a unique eco-conscious refill.

The line has a uniquely beautiful scent, ‘High Cliff’, created in collaboration with renowned perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, Founder and Artistic Director of Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Perfume Creation Director of Parfums Christian Dior.

All the products will be available on www.stellamccartneybeauty.com and through a selection of UK retailers and boutiques including: the Stella McCartney UK flagship store on Old Bond Street from early September and Space NK from mid-September.

Stella McCartney has chosen to support the conservation NGO Wetlands International, committing to donate 1% of the net sales of STELLA skincare."
LVMH will reduce its electricity consumption by 10 percent - Inverse,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL2x2bWgtZW5lcmd5LXJlZHVjdGlvbi1wbGFuLWVsZWN0cmljaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you want to reduce your energy bill, they say you should turn off the lights and adjust your thermostat. Luxury giant LVMH is doing both — not to save money, but to ease up on its overall energy consumption.

LVMH Group — parent company of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany & Co., and more — announced a plan that would reduce its overall electricity use by 10 percent. The announcement comes shortly after the President of the French Republic addressed tensions in the electricity market this winter, calling on retailers and businesses to lead by example.

Dimming the lights — Between October 2022 and October 2023, the LVMH Group will start turning off the lights in its Maison stores between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. every day. The administrative offices will follow a lights-out rule at 9 p.m. In the industrial sites, administrative sites, and stores, the Group also plans to adjust the indoor temperatures by 1 degree Celsius warmer in winter and 1 degree Celsius cooler in summer, compared to the usual heating and air conditioning settings.

LVMH employees will also receive training on how to improve their personal energy consumption on and off the clock. Whether it’s turning off lights and screens, unplugging chargers and electric cars, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, the company plans on managing consumption across the board.

Each of the Maisons will build off the overarching framework but have the option to adjust to their specific locations. Moët Hennessy, for example, plans to reduce its consumption by 15 percent in 2023. French employees are also encouraged to monitor and manage energy at home through the EcoWatt app.

Being this luxurious takes energy — According to the company’s announcement, LVMH’s current energy consumption in France is equivalent to a city of 150,000 inhabitants. By 2026, it plans to achieve a 100 percent supply of renewable or low-carbon energy across its workshops, stores, and offices. As of now, its French locations use 100 percent green electricity and 39 percent renewable energy globally.

Most companies turn to manufacturing, shipping, and resale to maintain their carbon footprint. Burberry followed a similar blueprint to LVMH when it received an SBTi approval by managing the impact of its operations and manufacturing, including the electricity and gas from its stores, manufacturing plants, and offices.

More investments throughout the energy transition will cover the sensors and meters needed to monitor the progress. The electricity reduction plan will apply to France first, and globally soon after."

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton honored the legacy of Virgil Abloh, the visionary who served as the French luxury giant's first Black creative director, with an event during the 15th annual show for Harlem's Fashion Row.

Harlem's Fashion Row, which supports and features work by Black and Latino designers, had models of all backgrounds on the runway walking to a mix of classical music and hip-hop. Black and Latino fashionistas mingled by the red carpet and sipped glasses filled with Chandon.

For an evening, creatives of color took center stage, receiving credit for their outsize influence on global fashion. As a white woman, I couldn't fully grasp the significance of the night. But I was glad to be a witness of it.

The Harlem's Fashion Row show is one of recent steps by LVMH to become more diverse and inclusive.

For Alencia Lewis, an African American model featured in the show, the partnership between LVMH and Harlem's Fashion Row marked an important moment for the industry.

""For me to be here, this is me pushing forward the vision Virgil had for fashion, which was more diversity,"" Lewis said of Abloh, who died in November.

LVMH, home to Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora, was the event's title sponsor. The company has promised to push for change in an industry not known for its diversity in leadership ranks, starting with more partnerships with designers of color.

Black creatives and fashionistas of color are cautiously optimistic, saying LVMH could set a new standard for an industry that's long had a problem with diversity.

""I want to see consistency throughout the year,"" Lewis, 29, said. ""I want to see Asian, Latino, Black, African creatives shown in everything, in all of your advertising and shows throughout the year. At the end of the day, this is a global brand. People look different, and they deserve to have that representation.""

Despite LVMH's recent efforts around diversity, there's more to be done, four Black creatives at the event told Insider.

""I definitely think big brands investing in Black creatives like they are now is overdue,"" said Chimere Ingram, an African American designer whose brand, ByIdol, was featured at the event. ""At the same time, it's a great thing how they're seeing how much we have creatively.""

Indeed, Black and Latino people have spearheaded many fashion trends that large brands have capitalized on, be it hoop earrings, long nails, or rap music.

""Many have built their brands on our culture, whether it's African culture or hip-hop culture. Now we're being recognized for our work,"" Ingram, 42, added. ""We need this recognition to continue. We need to be seen.""

Jen Evans, a 21-year-old content creator, agreed.

""This is game-changing to be celebrating Virgil's legacy. Growing up, I didn't see many people of my skin tone or people who looked like me in the industry, so tonight means everything to me,"" said Evans, who is Black.

""For LVMH to be here right now, that's them starting a whole movement for themselves and for other big brands around the world,"" she added.

LVMH's diversity journey is far from done

The luxury brand recently committed to mentoring 75 designers of color, investing in historically Black colleges and universities, and working with nonprofits like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

For more than a decade, LVMH has provided 1,500 middle school students in France with internship opportunities each year. Many of these students are African immigrants from marginalized backgrounds. And starting in 2008, the company began working with an independent diversity firm to audit its recruitment practices to help ensure hiring managers are not biased or discriminatory.

The brand also made waves with its announcement of Abloh's leadership in 2018, and its partnership with Rihanna for her Fenty fashion line in 2019. (Rihanna and LVMH have agreed to put their Fenty fashion collaboration on hold, less than two years after the launch.)

Yet for all of LMVH's work to promote diversity, and despite having a diverse workforce, its top leadership remains overwhelmingly white.

It's a problem of which the brand's leadership is aware.

""We want to have diverse leadership teams at all of our brands that reflect the world that we live in, the customers that we serve, and the employees that work for us,"" Gena Smith, the chief human-resources officer at LVMH, said. ""It's about starting with the objective, having very key actions that you hold yourself accountable to, and communicating where you are.""

The luxury conglomerate said in early 2021 that it planned to have people of color in senior leadership positions reach 30% within five years. So far, LVMH is on track to reach its goal, according to executives.

People of color now compromise more than 30% of leadership positions from vice president and up in North America, according to Corey Smith, LVMH's head of diversity and inclusion. The company has its sights on diversifying the C-suite next, he said.

""This isn't just about tonight,"" Smith, who is Black and Latino, said. ""It's about how we partner with entities like Harlem's Fashion Row to really expose creatives to what it takes to operate in this industry. But it's also two directional. We get exposure, and we're understanding their needs as well to help them succeed.""

Harlem's Fashion Row CEO Brandice Daniel said the partnership with LVMH felt intentional and serious in nature.

""To have a brand like LVMH say, 'We see you. We want to support the next generations of designers,' means more than I can explain. I think it's incredible that HFR and Black designers in general are getting this kind of support,"" Daniel, who is Black, said, referring to Harlem's Fashion Row. ""This is what we've dreamt of getting for years."""

Louis Vuitton reduces thermostat and light use in shops to save energy - The Guardian,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjIvc2VwLzE1L2x1aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1yZWR1Y2VzLXRoZXJtb3N0YXQtYW5kLWxpZ2h0LXVzZS1pbi1zaG9wcy10by1zYXZlLWVuZXJnedIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjIvc2VwLzE1L2x1aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1yZWR1Y2VzLXRoZXJtb3N0YXQtYW5kLWxpZ2h0LXVzZS1pbi1zaG9wcy10by1zYXZlLWVuZXJneQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, plans to lower the thermostat at its stores around the world as part energy-saving measures this winter.

The French conglomerate will also turn off the lights at its stores earlier, starting in France in October before being deployed worldwide.

LVMH said it would switch off the lights at its stores three hours earlier, leaving them off between 10pm and 7am, while its offices would go dark at 9pm.

The company, which is the world’s largest high-end goods conglomerate and operates 522 stores and 110 production sites in France, has also pledged to lower temperature settings at industrial sites by 1C in winter and raise them by 1C in summer.

It said the measures would allow it to cut its energy use by 10%.

The announcement follows a call from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, this month for industries, households and local authorities to reduce power consumption by 10% in response to Russia’s throttling of gas supplies and soaring energy prices.

This week authorities in Paris said the Eiffel Tower’s lights would go off an hour earlier.

Last month, France’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, urged companies to draft energy-saving plans this month, warning of the impact if the government was forced to ration supply of gas and electricity.

Retailers around the world are expected to implement measures to reduce their gas and electricity bills this winter.



The owner of Primark said last week it was expecting lower profits next year, as it grappled with a strong dollar and soaring costs that had pushed up its annual energy bills by about £100m.



In previous years, the fashion chain faced an increase in energy bills of about £10m, but this year it has been 10 times that figure, according to a spokesperson for its parent company, Associated British Foods.



The retailer’s finance chief, John Bason, said he welcomed news of the annual energy price cap of £2,500 for households from October announced by Liz Truss’s government.

Harlem's Fashion Row Celebrates 15 Years with LVMH - Town & Country,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLXRyZW5kcy9hNDExMDM0NDMvaGFybGVtcy1mYXNoaW9uLXJvdy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTE1LXllYXJzLXdpdGgtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Tuesday, September 6, Harlem’s Fashion Row (HFR) kicked off NYFW and celebrated fifteen years of uplifting Black designers in the industry. This year’s celebration, held outside of General Grant National Memorial, was especially notable, as the storied fashion agency partnered with Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) to showcase three unique designers; Johnathan Hayden, Nicole Benefield, and Clarence Ruth. “We act as a bridge between designers of color and retailers through events, collaborations, pipeline programs, and brand strategy,"" Founder & CEO of HFR Brandice Daniel told attendees.

Despite the downpour outside, guests put the phrase “through rain or shine” into practice, rising to the occasion with a variety of vibrant ensembles and mingling to the rhythm of live band music, all while glasses of Chandon Garden Spritz circled among the crowd. As the evening progressed, attendees eventually made their way toward the runway, and the HFR award ceremony commenced.

Award recipients, honored for exemplifying excellence in their fields, included industry leaders across fashion and entertainment: performer Janet Jackson, Washington Post senior critic-at-large Robin Givhan, designer Sergio Hudson, stylist Ade Samuel, and actress, writer, and producer Issa Rae, who accepted HFR’s first-ever Virgil Abloh Award presented by LVMH. “Throughout her career, Issa has exemplified many of the attributes I admire most about Virgil: creativity, integrity, fortitude, and a deep commitment in using one’s platform in service of others,” said the late designer’s wife Shannon Abloh.

After the round of applause came to a close, the music began, and the runway models emerged from behind the curtains. The first designs to appear on the catwalk were those of Johnathan Hayden, who presented a collection of carefully engineered textiles inspired by his travels to New Mexico. “I usually visit my family in New Mexico during the month of October to attend the annual International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta,"" says Hayden. ""It is magic captured in a candy land confectionery of sewn patterns and colors that dot the skyline like sprinkles tossed carefree across The Land of Enchantment,” adds Hayden as he describes his collection.

During the show, the talented designer successfully brought his vision to life, presenting a cohesive collection that embodied a range of bold prints, pastel shades, and gorgeous fabrics that moved with ease “Thinking about this idea of ascension, I built a narrative traveling from the deepest depths of the ocean to the highest high of the sky, clouds, and atmosphere.”

Hayden also notes that the HFR x LVMH partnership, which provided him the opportunity to present his work for the second time during New York Fashion Week, not only marks a historic milestone for HFR, but also for the fashion industry as a whole: “We as designers have an opportunity to have the full attention of our industry, and I am excited to see what precedent this will establish for talent acquisition and future collaborations in the fashion industry.”

Following Hayden’s presentation was that of Nicole Benefield, who has an impressive 20 years of building collections for large womenswear brands under her belt. And although Benefield has displayed her work countless times before, this show was different, as her creations hailed from her own authentic brand, Nicole Benefield Portfolio. “I call my collection a continuous conversation, and the inspiration is grounded in thinking about its capacity to transition from one season to the next,” says Bendefield.

Benefield’s designs, which embody casual sophistication, are also firmly rooted in sustainability, an initiative in which she holds close to her personal ethos. “Sustainability efforts aren't cheap, and when we think of fashion, it’s almost the antithesis of what sustainability is at its core,” says Benefield. “For me, I have to think about creating with biodegradable fabrics that are well-made, stand the test of time, and most importantly I’m mindful about the consumer’s needs.”

And while crafting sustainable pieces that are simultaneously functional and appealing is no easy feat, Benefield successfully surpassed expectations. On the runway, Benefield's designs merged at the intersection of effortless and wearable, while also demonstrating her ability to invent organic shapes and play with portions.



The final designer to close out the evening was Clarence Ruth, founder of Cotte D'Armes and wearer of many hats including author, creative director, model, and artist. “The way I approach my art is similar to my approach in designing clothes, these two different mediums allow me to share a story.”

So, what is the story behind Ruth’s HFR x LVMH presentation? “With this collection, I wanted to encourage people to think outside the box, and I took two totally different things and merged them together: biker culture and clergy culture,” says Ruth.

Ruth's introduction to the power of fashion existed within the walls of the church, where he learned about sartorial elegance and the definition of Sunday best. Within his presentation, church motifs tactfully meld with bold hues and athletic wear to create a fresh perspective. “Although they exist within two different worlds, both the biker community and the church community reflect the same mindset of having each other's back.""

Aside from discovering ingenuity in uncharted territory, Ruth also owes much of his inspiration to his seven-year-old son, who inspires him to continue forging a positive path for future generations. “I feel like we have an obligation as creatives to construct a space for artists of the future. With this show, I’m looking forward to showing the industry what we can do— and by 'we' I mean not just Clarence, Nicole, or Jonathan, but Black and Brown talent in the fashion industry.”

"LVMH Métiers d'Art Takes Stakes in Heng Long Italy, Robans - Yahoo Movies Canada","Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9sdm1oLW0tdGllcnMtZC1hcnQtMTYxNzAwNDI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Métiers d’Art is adding to its roster of suppliers with the acquisition of a majority stake in Heng Long Italy and taking a minority stake in Robans.

Heng Long Italy is the new name for the former Ally Projects, aimed to better reflect that it is the longstanding European outpost of Singapore’s famed Heng Long Tannery. The original Heng Long Tannery was founded in 1977 and became a renowned supplier of alligator and crocodile skin, before being acquired by LVMH in 2011 in a deal then valued at $161 million.

More from WWD

Ally Projects was formed in 2013 to supply Italian fashion houses with exotic animal skin from the leather hub of Santa Croce sull’Arno. It’s known for its small batch orders and short lead times which has made it a key and agile supplier for European brands. The Métiers d’Art support is aimed at helping Heng Long Italy to develop even further its capacity as demand continues to grow unabated.

Robans is also a new name, formerly Roban’s Produzione, for the artisanal ready-to-wear manufacturer that specializes in producing leather and suede collections for luxury labels. The house was started in 1989 by brothers Andrea and Roberto Palmieri in Pisa, Italy. Robans is growing its material research and treatment specialties, and has been key in recruiting and training young people of the region to enter into craftsmanship careers.

LVMH has been investing in cultivating strategic suppliers as well as manufacturers to strengthen its supply chain. The LVMH Métiers d’Art division was set up in 2015 tasked with helping the conglomerate’s houses build and maintain strong sourcing of rare materials, as well as education and training for the industry. The same year it acquired a stake in Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà. A stake in another Santa Croce sull’Arno-based tannery Masoni followed in 2019 as it continues to strengthen its supply chain.

Jean Arnault on the steps towards a Louis Vuitton high horology academy - Financial Times,"Thu, 01 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzk0MGViN2Q4LThlODItNDFhMy1hODA5LTdmYTg4NTZmNTc2NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

It has been 20 years since Louis Vuitton entered the watch market and Jean Arnault, its marketing and development director, uses an anthropomorphic analogy to describe a brand that he says is on the threshold of maturity. “Twenty years of watchmaking is obviously not a long time,” he admits. “But, if you compare it to a human being, when you’re 20, you’ve a lot of tough choices to make: either you’re going into advanced academics, or you decide to start working straight away and begin your career path.”

As the youngest son of Bernard Arnault — billionaire owner of luxury parent group LVMH — Jean may be only three years older than the watch brand he is working for, but he is already considering what the next 20 years might bring for Vuitton’s watches.

The brand’s signature watch design has been the Tambour — a bulbous, drum-like case shape which has been central to Vuitton’s development, and the anniversary is being marked with the Tambour Twenty. It is a 200-piece limited edition chronograph, equipped with a modified El Primero calibre from Zenith, also part of the LVMH watch stable. The new model has been entered into this year’s Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) — the Oscars of the watch world.

However, this month sees another anniversary chez Vuitton, which has already brought awards. Arnault is marking his first year at the helm of the brand’s watch division, having notched up two wins at the GPHG in that time — one for best diving watch and the audacity prize for its half-million-euro Carpe Diem timepiece.

The Tambour Twenty

“Some people say that the GPHG award is not worth much commercially, but it made a huge impact, both commercially and in terms of reputation,” he observes. “We’re surprised by the number of traditional collectors we recruited through that piece. Initially, markets told us we would be able to sell three, now we have orders for 30.”

Vuitton’s watches can be found only in the brand’s 200 own boutiques, with online sales accounting for “low two figures in terms of percentage”.

LVMH, overall, reported higher-than-expected revenue of €18.4bn for the second quarter of this year — but the world’s biggest luxury group does not disclose figures for its individual luxury brands — let alone product sectors within brands. Arnault gives an indication, though. He likens his high watchmaking business to that of fellow Swiss independent brands such as FP Journe and De Bethune. And he describes the core business in mechanical timepieces, up to around €12,000 per watch, as being similar to the size of LVMH stablemate Zenith. Very roughly, this equates to around 25,000 pieces per annum.

However, unlike the independent brands or indeed Zenith, Vuitton has invested “significant resources” in the development of its own connected smartwatch, the Tambour Horizon, which he says is half of the business. The beauty of Vuitton, he adds, is that it can focus on the high craftsmanship of both the mechanical and electronic aspects of making smartwatches.

There is a tendency to underestimate the amount of work that goes into an electronic watch, Arnault explains, but he wants to double down on investment and expand the brand’s resources.

At the end of last year, Vuitton purchased Micro Edge, a small watchmaking supplier that specialises in hand finishing and high watchmaking components: tourbillon cages, levers and gears, minute repeater gongs and the like.

Vuitton plans to have almost every component designed, manufactured and assembled at La Fabrique du Temps, the brand’s eight-year-old watch factory in Geneva, to which the new workforce will relocate. The factory employs about 100 people, with another 20 joining from Micro Edge. “Our goal in the next six months is to have everybody under one roof.”

Arnault has even bigger plans for the factory: “I want to turn it into an academy for high watchmaking.” As part of the 20th anniversary celebrations, a competition will be announced, inviting young independent watchmakers to present their creations to the public and a panel of experts, with Vuitton offering support to the winner.

Arnault also plans to revive the Daniel Roth brand, part of LVMH-owned jeweller Bulgari.

In the 1970s, as one of the pioneer independents, Roth played a crucial role in the relaunch of Breguet — a favourite of French royalty. He subsequently launched his eponymous brand in 1990, which was acquired by Bulgari in 2000 but has remained dormant for many years.

“We decided with Bulgari that we would jointly build the company as a separate entity of LVMH, respecting its high watchmaking roots,” says Arnault.

Given his obvious enthusiasm for the culture and history of the craft, high watchmaking looks set to become more important — in terms of both complications and finishing.

Arnault can also be expected to address current limitations in the range, such as the absence of an elegant integrated case and a bracelet sports watch.

But he is not yet ready to reveal details: “Today we’re focused on the anniversary, but next year is going to be something interesting.”"
"After LVMH Group, also Valentino will start turning off the lights in its stores - nss magazine","Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8zMDkwNC92YWxlbnRpbm8tbHZtaC1lbmVyZ3ktcmVkdWN0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATE 07/10/22: After LVMH, Valentino shops will also go dark, at least after working hours. The luxury brand has pledged to turn off the lights in its boutiques, a network of 95 shops worldwide, after 10pm, both to renew the company's sustainable commitment and to address the cost of energy consumption. In addition to inaugurating a section of its website dedicated solely to the brand's sustainable efforts, under the name ""Creating Shared Value,"" in fact, the brand revealed that 80 percent of all energy consumed in its facilities in Italy (and thus stores, factories and offices) comes from renewable sources. Valentino said it expects to save up to 800 kWh of energy, equivalent to the energy used by 13,000 light bulbs.

In response to the looming energy crisis in Europe, the LVMH Group yesterday announced its Energy Reduction Plan, which plans to reduce electricity consumption by 10 percent in all of the group's stores and offices. Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy and Kenzo boutiques, to name a few, as well as Sephora stores, will turn off all lights between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., while lights will be turned off at 9 p.m. in administrative offices. The group will also lower the heat by one degree in the winter and limit the use of air conditioning next summer. «Although our group uses very little energy, we are aware of the visibility and impact our decisions can have in leading the way for others. This energy efficiency plan represents an unprecedented effort that we hope will have a positive impact across the sector and beyond,» said Antoine Arnault. «We are acting today in a very concrete way to respond to the unprecedented energy crisis we are facing.»

Lights out at 10 p.m in stores and temperature reduction in all locations: two of the key measures taken by LVMH to enable a 10% reduction in energy consumption. https://t.co/I58aKN2MtM — LVMH (@LVMH) September 15, 2022

The announcement of the energy-saving plan follows French President Emmanuel Macron's Sept. 5 call to reduce energy consumption in France by 10 percent, and spoke of the need for ""energy sobriety."" In addition to reducing electricity consumption, which will begin in France before expanding to the rest of the world, LVMH will also launch an awareness campaign for employees to encourage turning off unnecessary lights and screens and using other electronic devices. Individual brands in the group may set additional targets, such as Moët Hennessy, which aims to reduce consumption by 15 percent globally by 2023. As WWD explains, the company currently consumes enough megawatts in France to supply the city of Dijon with electricity for a year, which it gets from sustainable sources. Globally, renewable energy accounts for 39 percent, and the Life 360 sustainability plan promoted by Antoine Arnault aims to achieve 100 percent renewable or low-carbon energy by 2026. «This energy efficiency plan is in line with our long-standing vision: protecting the environment is not just an obligation, but an imperative. We do not have the luxury of waiting,» Arnault added."
These ETFs are capitalizing on the luxury goods boom - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGVzZS1ldC1mcy1hcmUtY2FwaXRhbGl6aW5nLW9uLXRoZS1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtYm9vbS0xNTE3MzE3MjguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From couture fashion to high-end automobiles, it seems luxury buyers can’t get enough.

High-end retailer Neiman Marcus says 2% of its customers account for 40% of sales, and those wealthy customers are buying the retailer’s luxury brands. Neiman says the top 20 brands on offer are all high-end brands.

Luxury outfitter Canada Goose (GOOS), which just crossed the $1 billion sales mark, recently said it has zero issues with inventory gluts affecting other retailers, and that it never needs to discount its goods because sales are so strong.

And in the luxury automotive world, luxury brands like Rolls-Royce (BMW.DE), Audi (VOW.DE), and Lamborghini claim client demand is insatiable, especially at the highest end. In fact Mercedes-Benz’s (MBG.DE) new corporate long-term strategy calls for focusing more on the its most expensive models, and reducing the amount of entry-level vehicles for sale.

“First, the wealthy have been little affected by the pullback in the markets — they keep buying,” VettaFi Founder & CEO Tom Lydon told Yahoo Finance on why luxury buying is so strong at this time. “Also, luxury brands overseas are less expensive for U.S. buyers as the USD has been on a roll.”

VettaFi specializes in offering research and trends analysis in the world of ETFs. One way for investors to capture a piece of the high-end luxury boom is to invest in ETFs that model that market.

There are only a handful of ETFs and active funds that track this market, and most of those are below $50 million in assets under management (AUM). The largest ETF by assets that focuses on the luxury consumer market is the Amundi S&P Global Luxury ETF (GLUX.DE), which has an AUM of around $360 million.

The top holdings in the ETF are Richemont (Cartier, IWC, Chloe), LVMH Moet Hennessy (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Tiffany), Tesla, Hermés, and Estée Lauder; though the fund also holds stakes in Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga), spirits brand Diageo, and Nike. Foreign conglomerates like Richemont and LVMH in particular are benefiting from the strong US dollar, which makes their goods even more attractive to stateside buyers.

Looking for the next luxury buyers

When looking ahead at where investors can go to capture nascent luxury buyers, there is only one place to turn to — youth.

“Looking at demographics, the biggest contributors to the global sales recovery in 2021 were millennials and Gen Z,” Global X Funds director of research Pedro Palandrani told Yahoo Finance. “These two cohorts are expected to make up 70% of all spending on luxury goods over the coming years.”

Palandrani says high-end luxury brands tend to have a strong customer loyalty, where existing customers are 50% more likely to try new products and spend more, on average, compared to new customers. Millennials and Gen Z tend to be loyal customers of the brands they purchase, he says.

Palandrani suggests investors take a look at the The Global X Millennials ETF (MILN) to capture that behavior. “It’s a fund that seeks to invest in companies that have a high likelihood of benefiting from the rising spending power and unique preferences of the U.S. Millennial generation,” Palandrani says. “As of today, you’ll see companies such as Peloton (PTON), Lululemon (LULU), Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX), and others, which tend to have premium pricing but also strong customer loyalty.”

Lastly Palandrani suggests another area that I myself have seen high-end consumption in, electric vehicles (EVs). Purchase prices for EVs tend to be on the higher end, mostly luxury, and these are the kinds of cars manufacturers cannot keep on dealer lots.

The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) seeks to invest in “companies involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, EVs, and EV components and materials. Many of these companies offer premium vehicles,” Palandrani says. Notable holdings in the ETF include Tesla (TSLA), NIO (NIO), Lucid (LCID), Microsoft (MSFT), Ford (F), and Apple (AAPL).

"Plant-based chicken joins Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy! - WATTAgNet Industry News & Trends","Fri, 02 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXR0YWduZXQuY29tL3BvdWx0cnktZnV0dXJlL25ldy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMvYmxvZy8xNTUzNjQxNi9wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1jaGlja2VuLWpvaW5zLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZGlvci1hbmQtZ2l2ZW5jaHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chicken breasts made from biostructured proteins will eventually be better than the genuine article, their developers believe. (Courtesy Planted)

Luxury goods group LVMH, owner of a number of top-end brands including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Moet and Chandon, has entered the alternative meat sector. Well, to be a little more precise, the investment has been made by L Catterton, the largest global consumer-focused private equity firm, and of which LVMH is a partner.

So, what, exactly, has tempted LVMH, which owns 75 luxury “houses”, to enter alternative proteins by taking a stake in an alternative chicken house, so to speak?

What has whetted the group’s appetite is a Swiss company called Planted, a university spin-off based in Kemptthal, which will launch its plant-based chicken breasts later this month in Berlin - in the restaurant of a Michelin star restaurant, no less.

Novel biostructuring approach

Planted was founded as recently as 2019 and claims to be Europe’s fastest growing alternative protein company.

It focuses on what it calls the perfect bite through its novel biostructuring approach that combines protein structuring and fermentation. The technology enables the company to design and produce larger pieces of meat with complex structures, texture, juiciness and tenderness.

Biostructured proteins will, Planted believes, eventually outperform animal meat in terms of taste, sustainability, health, efficiency and price.

Planted is currently in the final phase of launching various whole-cut products, such as chicken tenders and chicken breast portions. The range will first enter the foodservice market before being launched to retail.

With an extra CHF70 million (US$81 million) under its belt, Dior or otherwise, the company will be better able to roll out this new range and extend the reach of its current offering.

Alternative or imitation?

Not everyone, however, believes in favor of alternative proteins and some like to disparagingly refer to them as mock meat.

For those readers, it might be amusing to consider that the Aura Blockchain Consortium, which allows anyone to quickly authenticate whether a product is a genuine luxury article or a fake, and of which LVMH is a founding member, reports that the trade in fake goods worth around US$4.5 trillion annually.

Luxury goods account for around 60% of the total, but brands cannot easily prevent counterfeiters from creating copy versions of goods, Aura says.

If Planted’s chicken breasts are as good as they say they are, the next time that you sit down to your chicken dinner, with or without a glass of Moet and Chandon, you might want to think about whether your are really eating chicken - or peas, oats and sunflower seeds.

I think that I’d be happy either way, particularly should there be a second glass of Moet!

LVMH Wins City Council Approval for Rodeo Drive Hotel - The Real Deal,"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDkvMjEvYmV2ZXJseS1oaWxscy1jaXR5LWNvdW5jaWwtYXBwcm92ZXMtcm9kZW8tZHJpdmUtaG90ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Developer LVMH has nearly reached the finish line after the Beverly Hills City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the French conglomerate’s plans to build a 115-key Cheval Blanc hotel on Rodeo Drive.

“It’s visionary, it’s the future,” Beverly Hills Mayor Lili Bosse said of the proposal at the end of the four-hour meeting, during which council members deliberated over the project’s final environmental reviews. “It’s an anchor to change the landscape.”

The council still needs to approve and finalize the development agreement between LVMH and the city. Such agreements vary from project to project, but last year, Beny Alagem’s organization agreed to pay a $100 million public benefit payment over the course of eight years as part of his $2 billion hotel and residential plan on Wilshire Boulevard.

In 2018, LVMH bought the building at 468 Rodeo Drive — formerly occupied by Brooks Brothers — for $245 million, public property records show. The luxury retailer filed plans with the city two years later to develop the hotel.

A number of luxury retailers, including Hermès, Giorgio Armani and Chanel, had objected to the proposed hotel, arguing it would block a shared alley used by their stores to serve VIP clients.

When the city’s planning commission approved the project in June, commission staff said LVMH had addressed the retailers’ grievances.

The site of the proposed Cheval Blanc isn’t LVMH’s only property on the famous street. In December, the company bought the former 86-room Luxe hotel on Rodeo Drive for $200 million, though it’s unclear what the retailer plans to do with that property."

Grant’s final resting place, a domed mausoleum illuminated with pink lights on West 122th street in Morningside Heights. Despite an epic New York downpour, a hundred-something guests came out to attend Harlem Fashion Row’s 15th Anniversary Style and Awards Show, held in partnership with LVMH.

A reminder was sent out hours before the event asking attendees to to carry an umbrella and dress in collections by designers of color. Alongside the white runway, Telfar bags could be spotted on every other seat. Guests jumped over puddles in Brother Vellies clogs and Pyer Moss Reebok sneakers. Luckily, the torrent stopped just in time for the award show to kick off with stylist Ade Samuel—a Bronx native who started her career at Teen Vogue and now works with Yara Shahidi and Kelly Rowland —winning Stylist of the Year.

Next up, Robin Givhan, senior critic-at-large at The Washington Post, was awarded Editor of the Year. In her acceptance speech, she urged the aspiring fashion writers in the audience, “Do not be a fashion journalist—there’s no need to qualify it. Simply be a journalist. Give the industry that respect because it deserves it.”

Minutes later, an unexpected guest took the stage. Shannon Abloh, the late Virgil Abloh ’s wife, arrived to award actress Issa Rae the first ever Virgil Abloh Award presented by LVMH. Issa Rae told the audience she didn't get the chance to know the designer very well while he was here, but that she was always an admirer from afar. “When I think of him, I think of pure ingenuity, I think about bold breaking of barriers, a path-defining confidence, and I most appreciate him as a high-fashion doorman because of all the doors that he opened for others.”

Deonté Lee/BFA.com Brandice Daniel, Harlem Fashion Row Founder, with Issa Rae, Shannon Abloh, and Corey Smith, Head of Diversity & Inclusion, North America at LVMH.

She mimicked the movement of a revolving door with her hands, laughing, before continuing, “It was intentionally, and through his visibility—because he existed, because he believed in himself, because he looked after so many others who looked like him, like us.” Before she could get to the rest of her speech, she was cut off by a roar of applause and foot-stomping enthusiastic enough to splash the rainwater right back on the runway— although no one seemed to mind by that point.

Rae said she was overjoyed to be the inaugural winner of the award, adding “I love to be the first, but I vow as long as I’m working to not be the last.” Before walking off the stage, she gave a shout out to designer Sergio Hudson, who made one of her “favorite Emmy dresses ever,” a bright orange cutout dress she wore on the red carpet in 2020.

Hudson was presented Designer of the Year shortly after. He spoke of his desire to be acknowledged foremost for his work, not his background: “We are not a monolithic people. We don’t just do one thing, we do everything. We are human beings, we’re not just Black. I don’t run away from being a Black man. I’m a Black man who happens to be a designer. I’m a designer who just happens to be Black man.”

The awards were followed by collections from three presenting designers, Clarence Ruth, Johnathan Hayden, and Nicole Benefiel, all of whom have been entered into a mentorship program through Louis Vuitton Americas. To end the night, Janet Jackson was awarded Icon of the year at the afterparty at the Jazz at Lincoln Center.

It was still raining on and off when the evening concluded, but when they look back on the evening, guests most likely won't even remember the damp. And they'll probably never see a doorman again without thinking of the doors Virgil Abloh opened."

Planning Approves Dior French Restaurant on Rodeo Dr. - Beverly Hills Courier,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmV2ZXJseWhpbGxzY291cmllci5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNS9wbGFubmluZy1hcHByb3Zlcy1kaW9yLWZyZW5jaC1yZXN0YXVyYW50LW9uLXJvZGVvLWRyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The City of Beverly Hills greenlighted a three-story Christian Dior building on North Rodeo Drive with a new wrinkle for the famous fashion brand – a rooftop restaurant intent on courting celebrities.

The Beverly Hills Planning Commission approved Sept. 8 by a 4-0 vote, a retail and restaurant development at 319-323 North Rodeo Drive. Commissioner Peter Ostroff was not present for the vote.

The project applicant is a limited liability company, 319-323 N. Rodeo LLC, that is associated with Dior corporate parent, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Dior and LVMH are each headquartered in Paris.

The snazzy expansion of the 319-323 N. Rodeo Drive site comes on the heels of LVMH developing the Cheval Blanc hotel, which is slated for the corner of Rodeo Drive and South Santa Monica Boulevard. Architect Peter Marino is designing both projects.

In addition to Marino, LVMH will work with Los Angeles-headquartered planning and design firm Gruen & Associates to raze the site’s current Dior retail building, according to materials presented to the Planning Commission.

In its stead, a 29,700-square-foot, 60-foot tall building is slated for construction.

Included are two floors of retail that the applicant has deemed the “West Coast flagship” for the Christian Dior company. Retail space will “showcase the latest ready to wear for both men and women watches, fine jewelry, fragrances, and accessories,” according to the developer’s filing with the city.

The third-floor restaurant “will serve French cuisine and French pastries” from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day with the restaurant’s name not determined. The rooftop locale’s ambitions extend beyond serving frog’s legs and onion soup.

“The roof top space will be used for exceptional personal service for very important clients (VIC) and special events and launches,” the filing reads.

These include “private for events for special limited product launches,” plus “personal appointments with celebrities and VIC hosted by Dior team in preparation for special events, such as film festivals and award shows.”

In an hour-long deliberation over the project, Commissioners did not focus on the rooftop soirees, though Commission Vice Chair Gary Ross noted that it is the first time Christian Dior will enter the restaurant business.

Instead, Commissioners led by Jeff Wolfe, sought to better understand parking for the building.

City statute dictates that such a project requires 89 parking spaces. But the applicant provided five surface parking spaces and a basement parking level that includes 29 spaces. The facility will include a hydraulic lift enabling valet attendants to stack cars on top of one another.

The applicant proposed that additional space for cyclists plus parking structures at 9510 North Brighton Way and 345 North Beverly Drive would provide sufficient parking options.

Ashok Vanmali, a partner at Gruen Associates, explained that valet attendants will handle the parking including moving cars off site. Wolfe and others expressed concern about congestion on Rodeo Drive and whether there would be enough valet attendants.

While approving the project, Wolfe vowed to keep a watch on the parking situation.

Planning Commission Chair Myra Demeter also inquired about the parking but noted to the applicant, “You’ve already proven to be very adaptable to our suggestions.”

Indeed, LVMH appeared before the Planning Commission multiple times from this March to June in order to iron out traffic concerns regarding the nine-story, 115-room Cheval Blanc. As for the Dior project, it may lead to a transfer of land. A company with the address of LVMH’s New York City office purchased part of the property back in 2012 for $85 million, according to public records.

Another component of the land is owned by Beverly Hills Properties III LLC, a company registered by Anthony Palermo, a real estate investor with a business address in Sherman Oaks.

Under an agreement between the property owners, LVMH leases land from Beverly Hills Properties, with an option to purchase the property. The LVMH entity has not decided whether to purchase the land it presently leases on the project site, according to Deborah Quick, a lawyer at Perkins Coie who is advising the developers."

The French giant continues to shop: LVMH Métiers d’Art, in fact, acquired a majority share of tanning laboratory Ally Projects (better known with the name Heng Long Italia) and a minority share of Robans, specialized in leather apparel. Both companies are located in Tuscany. “Our goal is to support the market’s main manufacturers and the strategic parts of the group’s supply chain”, says Matteo De Rosa, CEO of LVMH Métiers d’Art, as he announces additional investments.

LVMH continues shopping up the chain

The first operation

LVMH is strengthening its supply chain for leather with two main operations made by LVMH Métiers d’Art, holding company created in 2015. Today, the entity owns a dozen companies operating in the leather and fashion chain that generate about 500 million euro in revenue each year. The first operation was the acquisition of Ally Projects, tanning laboratory in Santa Croce sull’Arno (on the right, in photo from Facebook), active since 2013 “to supply Italian fashion brands exotic leather, starting with crocodile”.

WWD points out how this entity is the European outpost of Singapore-based Heng Long. This is the tanneries for which, in 2011, LVMH spent 161 million USD (to acquire 51% of it), leaving 49% to the founding family. With the support of LVMH Métiers d’Art, Heng Long Italia will develop its production capacity, given that demand for exotic leather keeps on growing. “Italy will then become central in order to respond more rapidly to our brands’ demands for sophisticated productions”, explained De Rosa to Fashion Network.

The second operation

The second operation is tied to Robans (already Roban’s Produzione). Founded in 1989 by Andrea Palmieri, it’s specialized in the production of leather and suede leather collections for luxury brands. It works with all types of leather: lamb, calf, exotic, mutton, fur (on the left a photo from the company’s website). And, “it recently acquired know-how on textiles and technical materials as well”. “This is our first investment in the apparel segment. Our goal is to support the market’s main producers and the group’s strategic chain”, concludes De Rosa, as he announces additional investments to safeguard the production chain, under stress from the pandemic, war, energy crisis and more.

Bounding into the bespoke shoe-atelier of Berluti, which he has run since 2011, the lithe 45-year-old is in his element among the rooms of cobblers chipping away at shoe lasts, embroidering boots with waxed cotton thread, and chamfering, layering and buffing fine leathers. “To me, this is like entering the studio of Geppetto in Pinocchio,” he says. “It’s a window into our savoir faire.”

Savoir faire is a phrase that Arnault is particularly keen on. Since 2002 when, at the age of 25, he joined his father at LVMH, Bernard Arnault’s oldest son has led the way in letting fans in on the know-how of the world’s biggest luxury-goods group; particularly with Les Journées Particulières, a free, three-day worldwide festival (this year in October) during which LVMH ateliers open to introduce visitors to what Arnault calls “the magic of making”.

Antoine Arnault DMITRY KOSTYUKOV/NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX/EYEVINE

His idea of allowing the public to go behind the scenes occurred to him when the Élysée Palace had an open day. “There were six-hour queues to get in and look around for about five minutes. I thought, ‘You know what – without being immodest, we have national treasures too. We have the atelier of couture of Monsieur Dior and the atelier of Monsieur Givenchy. We have these incredible vineyards in Champagne and near Bordeaux that people want to see.’ ” At first he wasn’t sure his father would like his idea. “Obviously you want to keep some of the mystery and, to be honest, we had this tradition of being secretive which came from the top, from my father who has always been like that – it’s his mindset and his way of doing business. But he could see we needed new ideas, and he said yes right away.”

That was partly because, he says, at that time their attempted takeover of Hermès had failed. “In the press, people were representing LVMH as this sort of predator: as a group without values, as a group that was obsessed only with growing outside. But everything I saw was precisely the opposite: 99 per cent of the work we did was maintaining the savoir faire, employing artisans, understanding how the skills of these artisans were preserved and transmitted . . . And that wasn’t being shown.”

When in 2011 they opened the doors of 20 maisons across their design and accessories houses, he was slightly nervous. “We didn’t sell tickets, so I didn’t know if people would turn up. But when I went out on the first day at 7.45am, there was a line of like 200 people. So I thought, ‘It’s going to be OK.’ ”

It was more than just OK. This year’s event will include 57 LVMH maisons in 96 locations across 15 countries, from tanneries in Paris and perfumers in Tokyo to jewellers in New York. At Broderies Vermont, designated in France as a Living Heritage Company, embroiderers will demonstrate techniques used to embellish couture. At Rimowa, in Germany, visitors will see suitcases being assembled by hand, as they have been since 1898, and in Champagne take tours of the (normally closed) Krug cellars.

While a few maisons have occasionally welcomed key clients in the past, others have never allowed anyone to enter but their employees. Some, like the design studio at Tiffany in New York, Arnault says, “even I have never seen – unless you work there, you can’t get inside”. And not all of them are big. “Some of the smaller ones are really magical,” he says proudly, “like Loewe or Buly or Berluti.”

Work at Berluti

The LVMH group has 75 brands, so it is not such a surprise that Arnault, who is also head of image, has yet to visit them all. When we meet, he is about to make his first tour of Château d’Esclans, the makers of the wildly successful Whispering Angel rosé and one of 16 wine and spirits maisons, from Glenmorangie to Château d’Yquem, that will open during the festival.

For first-timers, he says, Dior is probably the most impressive maison to visit. “Walk inside the atelier of couture and you feel the weight of history; it’s probably the same if you go into the office of the Queen at Buckingham Palace.” He also enjoys visiting the factory where Louis Vuitton luggage is made. “The music and the ballet of the artisans hitting with the nails to make the hard-sided luggage is something too; it’s like a beautiful symphony.”

Walking into the original Louis Vuitton factory in Asnières in northwest Paris, I find that he is right. Alongside a wall of Crittall-style windows with views over the Vuitton family’s handsome art nouveau house, an orchestra of artisans bang and sew, cut and hammer, with instruments that might have been used 200 years ago: sharp wooden-handled awls to make holes, mallets to knock in the trademark brass tacks, chisels to craft the poplar, beech and okoumé frames that make up the backbone of any Vuitton trunk.

While the tools haven’t changed much, the style of products they turn out certainly have. Alongside traditional trunks covered in the company’s iconic monogrammed leather, there are watch boxes in powder-pink suede; pale grey leather trainer wardrobes with Perspex fronts; a lime green tea-set box crafted to fit Chinese porcelain; a DJ trunk fitted with a turntable and even a bespoke dog-carrier with polished brass air vents. Each is a one-off, handcrafted in the finest snakeskin and calfskin, suede and leather, for clients around the world.

Many of the 300 artisans here had not made luggage before they arrived; some were butchers or hairdressers. Teaching artisans new skills, Arnault says, makes him proud. “People say that old skills are dying out but I disagree. We have a list of 280 different savoir faires that are being preserved. And as long as we are here, they won’t die. Machines and new materials are fine if they help artisans. But nothing can replace the human hand.”

Which is why the company developed the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence to help apprentices to develop skills from embroidering couture and building trunks to growing wine. Or why Loro Piana started a craft academy. LVMH is also in partnership with the NGO La Fabrique Nomade to help refugees to find ways of using their skills.

It is an approach that the entire family are invested in – whether that’s at Louis Vuitton (where his older sister Delphine, 47, is responsible for all product related activity), suitcases at Rimowa (whose chief executive was his half-brother Alexandre, 30, until he moved to Tiffany last year) or watches at Tag Heuer (run by his half-brother Frédéric, 27). “This group is our life and our future; it is a big responsibility,” he says. “So we spend time talking about the future, with my father and without my father. It is important we know each other and get along with each other.” Not that any of them expect their father to retire any time soon. The 73-year-old bought the company that owned Christian Dior in 1984 for $80 million and, through progressive buy-outs, has turned LVMH into the world’s biggest luxury goods company with revenue of €36.7 billion in the first half of 2022. He still pops into his Paris shops every Saturday morning.

While Arnault Jr tries to follow his father’s example, since he became a father himself – to two boys with his wife, the Russian philanthropist and model Natalia Vodianova, and a stepfather to her three children – his weekends have become a lot busier. Long Saturday lunches with Arnault Sr are less frequent. His wardrobe too has had to adapt. “When you have been vomited on by little children, you stop wearing your most precious silk or vicuna Loro Piana sweater,” he says.

Vodianova, who he married in a register office ceremony in September 2020, has had an influence on the way he dresses. “She is my personal stylist and I am hers,” he says. “I don’t know if she says it because she loves me or because she really, truly believes it, but for that last touch – shoes, bag and a little jewellery – she always asks what I think.”

Since he became chief executive of Berluti and then chairman of Loro Piana, his wardrobe has become more “nonchalantly elegant”, he says. Which translates to wearing well-fitted suits – but definitely no tie. That, he says, is “an accessory of the past”. Even for meetings of the LVMH board, of which he and Delphine are members, “I see older men with no tie, which you would have never seen ten years ago”. Today, he says, he can think of only three occasions at which he’d wear one: “to a funeral. Or a wedding”. Or, he quickly adds, “if I met Prince Charles. He is lovely and always has a tie on.”

But then, he says, English and Italian men are more elegant than the French. “They have this culture of the suit that we don’t have in France. I don’t want to speak badly of the French, but they don’t really have it in their genes. The women do. But the men in England or Italy are more elegant.” His most prized bits of clothing, he says, are a pair of Berluti ankle boots he was given for his baccalaureate, “but never wore because as a 17-year-old I was so impressed by them”, a Louis Vuitton watch given to him by Yves Carcelle at the launch 20 years ago, and two old Christian Dior Monsieur suits. Unlike his father, whose contemporary art collection is housed in the Frank Gehry-designed Fondation Louis Vuitton, art, he says, “is not really my passion. I love it, but one must have his own passions.”

But then, he claims, his family “are not very materialistic, to be honest. We don’t collect watches. We are not really collectors . . . Of course, I enjoy beautiful things. And I like a nice car and holiday. But I am more into experiences, and travelling in beautiful places and discovering new people.”

The Buly store on Rue de Saintonge in Paris

With that, he lifts his lean 6ft 3in frame from the battered leather armchair and, as he leaves, urges me to visit some of the maisons. Which I happily do, spending hours within the Buly apothecary’s theatrical 19th-century-style candlelit interiors, learning about natural remedies (from baobab oil to chalk powders), smelling exquisite botanically scented candles created by its co-founders Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami, and then watching an in-house calligrapher pen labels for my purchases with brown ink, as the 19th-century pharmacist after whom the brand was named might have done.

As Arnault predicted when he created Les Journées Particulières, the experiences of smelling, feeling, touching and learning about crafts can quickly convert visitors into fans and then, hopefully, into regulars.

In an announcement via LinkedIn, the Bernard Arnault-controlled luxury goods conglomerate said Schriver would bring ‘unique value’ to the role owing to his extensive knowledge of operating within the region.

Arnault stated: “I am delighted of Michael’s nomination. It is a strong signal of our determination to invest in our future in Asia and to enhance collaboration across our organisation.

“I have been working with Michael for over 20 years and have been constantly impressed with his understanding of the business at all levels. I will stay in close contact with him in his new role. His expertise, and the knowledge of the Group ecosystem and culture will be strong assets for us.”

Former Bulgari CEO Gets Thumbs-Down From Richemont Shareholders - JCK,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvZm9ybWVyLWJ1bGdhcmktY2VvLXJpY2hlbW9udC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Richemont shareholders voted overwhelmingly to keep former Bulgari CEO Francesco Trapani (pictured) off of its board, after Richemont’s chairman dubbed him an “inappropriate” candidate, given his ties to rival conglomerate LVMH.

Activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners had wanted Trapani—one of the fund’s cofounders—to represent the company’s A shareholders on the Richemont board. Bluebell has also urged Richemont to focus more on watches and jewelry.

But shareholders favored the board’s approved candidate, Wendy Luhabe.

Bluebell, which owns what Richemont called “a small stake” in the company, did not return a request for comment by the time of publication. But founding partner Giuseppe Bivona told Bloomberg that the vote represented a “partial victory” for Bluebell, as this was the first time Richemont designated a specific board member to represent its traded shares.

“It’s an important step,” he said, “and not an insignificant one.”

In a statement, Richemont chairman Johann Rupert said he was “deeply grateful to all our shareholders and wish to thank them for their vote of confidence in the leadership and governance of the company. The board can now continue to work in a collegial manner, in the interest of all our shareholders.”

The battle over Trapani’s appointment was unusually public and fractious.

Richemont’s board told shareholders that it “could not responsibly recommend to shareholders to let [Trapani], a person who has a long history of association with [LVMH]—as well as a personal relationship with that group’s main shareholder—become a director of our company and intervene in our company’s decision-making process.”

Trapani headed Bulgari when LVMH acquired it in 2011. Following that, he served as CEO of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division and as a member of LVMH’s board. He was also an adviser to LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

Trapani left LVMH in 2017 when he joined Tiffany’s board. The famed retailer received a purchase offer from LVMH two years later.

Richemont shareholders reject Bluebell board proposal at turbulent annual meeting - Vogue Business,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9yaWNoZW1vbnQtc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLXJlamVjdC1ibHVlYmVsbC1ib2FyZC1wcm9wb3NhbC1hdC10dXJidWxlbnQtYW5udWFsLW1lZXRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Tensions were high in Geneva at the Richemont annual general meeting on Wednesday, which saw the culmination of a corporate governance battle between the luxury group and activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners. “This is not a football match, it’s a shareholder meeting,” Richemont chairman Johann Rupert told the audience.

At the meeting, shareholders rejected Bluebell's proposals to overhaul Richemont’s board. Only 9.5 per cent voted to designate Bluebell candidate and co-founder Francesco Trapani, a former Bulgari CEO, to the board as representative for public or “Class A” shareholders. Instead, 84 per cent voted for Richemont candidate Wendy Luhabe, who already sits on the existing board. Previously, Richemont’s board did not have a Class A representative; and Bluebell argued that Rupert’s interests are overrepresented on the board. His Compagnie Financière Rupert owns 51 per cent of voting rights and 10 per cent of Richemont’s share capital.

Read More Richemont vs Bluebell: The corporate governance battle heats up Activist investor Bluebell is pushing for ex-Bulgari head Francesco Trapani to be added to the luxury conglomerate’s board — but Richemont is offering up its own internal candidate. Will founder Johann Rupert come around?

Richemont said in August that Trapani’s ties with rival LVMH made him “inappropriate” for its board of directors. After overseeing Bulgari’s acquisition by LVMH in 2011, Trapani became LVMH’s head of watches and jewellery from 2011 to 2014; and sat on Tiffany’s executive board from 2017 to 2019, when it was acquired by LVMH.

Ahead of the vote regarding Trapani, partner and Bluebell co-founder Giuseppe Bivona stressed a number of what he called “strategic” and “disclosure” issues. He said that Richemont has lost market share in jewellery and speciality watches to competitors since 2005; and flagged Richemont’s recent deal to sell its Yoox Net-a-Porter stake to Farfetch, which led to a €2.7 billion write down. “We welcome that the shift has been made to signal the exit. But, it remains to be seen what the total cost will be for shareholders,” Bivona said of the deal. He also criticised what he deemed the lack of an apparent succession plan for Rupert.

“I have not responded to you in the press. I am not going to now,” Rupert answered. “Except, why did you wait until two days before our colleagues were about to go on a holiday to do all of this when in November [2021] you wrote us a letter congratulating us on our results? You made a number of statements that are factually incorrect,” he said, denying that Richement has lost market share in jewellery and watches, its core business. He added that after fixing the watch business and online distributors, the company’s focus is now on its fashion and accessories business. “I am very pleased to say that they are starting to grow significantly driven by new creativity,” Rupert said."
Monitoring fermentation-induced CO2 becomes the secret weapon for LVMH Champagnes - Vitisphere,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpdGlzcGhlcmUuY29tL25ld3MtOTc1MTItbW9uaXRvcmluZy1mZXJtZW50YXRpb24taW5kdWNlZC1jbzItYmVjb21lcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXdlYXBvbi1mb3ItbHZtaC1jaGFtcGFnbmVzLS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A

new tool for measuring in real time the carbon dioxide emitted by must during alcoholic fermentation has neither a name nor a patent, and remains veiled in secrecy as it is rolled out across tanks producing Moët & Chandon Champagnes for the LVMH group. The new implement provides for granular monitoring, measuring every millisecond of CO2 flow, explains Marc Brévot, director of the Robert-Jean de Vogüé research centre in Oiry, Champagne. The equipment took ten years to develop with the winemaking expertise of the Montpellier Supagro School of Agronomy (Dr Jean-Marie Sablayrolles) and sensors provided by Vivelys (Oeneo group). It provides very detailed measurements of fermentation kinetics and can be used to automatically control winemaking, through temperature management and addition of oxygen, for instance.

“CO2 monitoring is much more informative than measuring density, which does not provide any dynamics, or carrying out winemaking analyses, which only provide a few details”, says Brévot. He points out the purpose of identifying when maximum CO2 is released: “Vmax, the tipping point between the exponential growth phase [of the yeasts] and the stationary phase”, he explains. Using the data from the sensors and the characteristics of each batch of grapes, Moët & Chandon has developed proper formulae for conducting alcoholic fermentation. By applying a “retro-engineering” rationale, Moët & Chandon's winemakers control fermentation of each batch in order to obtain a style of end product that matches the house’s signature aroma and flavour profile, says Brévot. “We are aiming for bespoke solutions: each vat is treated differently” through control algorithms. By collecting and analysing data from previous vintages, winemaking strategies can be adapted to suit each individual case. This year, for example, the data is useful for “honing the nitrogen supplementation strategy based on weather conditions for the vintage”, adds Brévot. Optimal fermentation conditions were also defined in the formulae, including turbidity, lipids and early sulphite addition."

Tycoon's wild $4.2 billion gamble on 'China's LVMH' crashes - The Straits Times,"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzLW1hcmtldHMvdHljb29ucy13aWxkLTQtYmlsbGlvbi1nYW1ibGUtb24tY2hpbmFzLWx2bWgtY3Jhc2hlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON - Six years ago, a little-known textile maker called Shandong Ruyi Group embarked on a frantic acquisition spree with the goal of becoming China's version of luxury powerhouse LVMH.

Based in the home town of Confucius, chairman Qiu Yafu spent more than US$3 billion (S$4.2 billion) snapping up assets from the boulevards of Paris to the heart of London tailoring on Savile Row. He bought French fashion brands Sandro and Maje, as well as heritage British trench coat maker Aquascutum and the maker of Lycra stretchy fabrics.

Those big dreams have since unravelled, and Ruyi is at the centre of a messy unwinding involving some of the world's largest financial institutions.

Ruyi is now losing control of key businesses and locked in disputes with creditors including Carlyle Group. In June, lenders took over United States-based Lycra Company, the spandex producer that Ruyi had bought from the billionaire Koch brothers. The next month, liquidators for another arm of Ruyi started inviting bids for Gieves & Hawkes, the bespoke tailor that has dressed every British monarch since George III. Court decisions in the coming months could decide the fate of other assets.

The rise of Ruyi came amid a US$400 billion outbound deal wave from China as the government sought to build up global champions. The authorities were encouraging traditional manufacturers to move up the value chain and help build a consumption-driven economy. Ruyi is now trying to offload assets in a difficult market, joining Chinese conglomerates like HNA Group and Anbang Insurance Group that have been reversing their global deal sprees.

""Most of the acquisitions made by Chinese companies overseas in recent years have not been successful,"" said Mr Jeffrey Wang, co-head of the Shanghai office at investment banking firm BDA Partners. ""The lengthy unwinding of Chinese companies is continuing for so long because they cannot afford to sell those assets at a big loss now.""

Mr Qiu, a 64-year-old former factory worker, has been holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room over the past few months negotiating with creditors, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He is trying to hold on to portions of his international empire, which also includes the Italian-inspired Cerruti 1881 label and British menswear retailer Kent & Curwen.

A Ruyi representative said that the companies it acquired were strategic investments and it worked hard to improve their performance, using local teams to manage the overseas operations.

""We were not out there making irrelevant acquisitions for the sake of winning trophy assets,"" the Ruyi representative said. ""It is just very unfortunate that the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with the Sino-US tension and tighter credit environment, had hit us badly.""

At first, Ruyi's strategy seemed like a sure winner. Increasingly affluent Chinese shoppers were flocking to European luxury goods, so Ruyi would snap up foreign brands that had neglected the Chinese market and bring them closer to where the demand was.

After buying a majority stake in French fashion group SMCP from KKR & Co in 2016, Ruyi helped it build up a network of more than 100 stores in the glittering malls of booming cities like Shanghai and Beijing.

It listed SMCP on the Paris bourse the next year, a success that gave Ruyi confidence to do more acquisitions.

In 2018, Mr Qiu publicly declared his goal of turning Ruyi into China's LVMH, and the company started being floated as a likely buyer whenever a Western consumer business went on the block. It suddenly seemed a long way from Ruyi's humble past exporting wool fabric to developing countries.

Executives waxed expansive about their international plans. But that ambition was not enough to revive brands whose star had already started to fade.

""Brands under the Shandong Ruyi umbrella have faced pressure from multiple angles in recent years, not only from the company's financial struggles, but also due to deflated demand for formalwear,"" said Ms Darcey Jupp, an analyst at London-based research firm GlobalData. ""Traditional formalwear brands that failed to react and casualise their ranges have inevitably fallen behind.""

For Ruyi, creditors soon came calling. Standard Chartered Bank filed a winding-up petition in December 2020 against Trinity, a Hong Kong-listed Ruyi unit that owns several brands including Gieves & Hawkes.

Then last year, a trustee seized a large stake in SMCP on behalf of creditors - which include Carlyle, BlackRock and Anchorage Capital Group - after the Chinese group defaulted on some exchangeable bonds. The trustee has since been facing off with Ruyi in court cases in England, Luxembourg, France and Singapore."

Bernard Arnault's Net Worth - How Wealthy is LVMH's Boss? - Finty,"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vZmludHkuY29tL3VzL25ldC13b3J0aC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault is a French national and billionaire, earning his fortune as CEO and chairman of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods brand. Arnault is one of the richest men in the world, and he appears in the top 5 richest on Forbes list.

Early life

Born on March 5, 1949, in Roubaix, France, Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault is the son of Jean Léon Arnault, a graduate of École Centrale Paris. His mother is Marie-Josèphe Savinel, the daughter of Étienne Savinel and owner of the engineering company Ferret-Savinel. Savinel passed on the management responsibilities to Jean Léon Arnault in 1950, before later giving him total ownership of the company.

Education

Bernard Arnault attended the top engineering school in France, the École Polytechnique, graduating in 1971.

How did Bernard Arnault build his net worth?

After graduating, Arnault started working at Ferret-Savinel, owned at the time by his father. Bernard earned a position as the organization's president in 1978, continuing with the company until 1984. During his tenure at the company, he shifted the organization's model away from construction, focusing on real estate instead.

In 1984, Bernard acquired Financiere Agache, a luxury goods company. He went in on the deal with his good friend, Antoine Bernheim. As the CEO of Financiere Agache, Bernard decided to acquire the textile business, Boussac Saint-Freres.

Boussac owned the luxury brand Christian Dior and many other successful brands, along with the department store Le Bon Marche. Arnault sold all Boussac assets apart from the Christian Dior brand and the department store.

In 1987, Bernard founded LVMH, a group of luxury brands forming the company after Moët Hennessy merged with Louis Vuitton in 1987. Bernard started a holding company in 1988, using it to acquire 24% of the LVMH shareholding for a sum of $1.5 billion.

Rumors circulated in the market that the Louis Vuitton group was attempting to buy LVMH stock to create a ""blocking minority."" As a result, Arnault invested a further $600 million into LVMH to acquire a 13.5% stake in the company, bringing his holdings to 37.5% of the total share float. After the purchase, Bernard became the largest single shareholder in the company.

Arnault invested another $500 million in LVMH, giving him a total of 43.5% of the outstanding shares in the company and 35% of the voting rights.

Bernard Arnault's productivity habits and personal strengths

Bernard Arnault is a private person, and there isn't much information available on his lifestyle. However, in an interview, Bernard says that he ensures he gets at least 7-hours of sleep every night to refresh his mind and reduce his stress. He says he designed his bedroom to create a space for sleep, enhancing the effects of his time between the sheets.

How rich is Bernard Arnault?

With a reported wealth of $168 billion, Bernard Arnault is one of the richest men in the world, and he chases giants like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Gautam Adani, and Jeff Bezos in a battle for positioning at the top of the Forbes richest list."
