LVMH Without Virgil: How the Conglomerate Can Speak to a New Generation - Jing Daily,"Tue, 09 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWdlbi16LXN0cmF0ZWd50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) first recognized the Virgil Abloh-effect back in 2014. At the late designer's first Off-White womenswear collection at Paris Fashion Week, he was selected as a finalist for the highly-coveted LVMH prize. Within a couple of years, zip ties, hazard tape, and quotation marks had become firm signifiers of young fashion-insiders. By 2018, Off-White was ranked as the hottest brand in the world .

That same year, Abloh was named as Louis Vuitton’s artistic director of menswear, succeeding Kim Jones; he was not only the first Black designer to head the luxury fashion house, but he also generated a trend of unconventional talents taking the place of traditional designers, having entered fashion as a creative polymath juggling DJing, architecture, and fashion design. And just one year after Abloh joined Louis Vuitton, the conglomerate announced a 16 percent revenue increase during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same financial period in 2018.

Bridging across various disciplines, he ultimately elevated the fashion that streetwear kids understood – the clothes that were a product of the music they listened to and the art that they loved. As the late-icon told Style magazine after that 2014 Off-White show, “The zeitgeist is what inspires me, this sort of collective thought of trends and how they move to different cities — what kids in Paris are talking about or what music they’re listening to.” Every show and presentation for both Louis Vuitton and Off-White felt like a love letter to his loyal younger audiences, celebrating the beauty of subculture for those immersed in it.

His presence within LVMH thus enabled it to engage immensely with Gen Z. Now, since his passing in late 2021, both the Louis Vuitton brand and its parent company LVMH face a void in filling his absence. Without his touch, LVMH stands to lose some of its hard-won approval of Gen Z. Consider that Kering-owned rival brands Gucci and Balenciaga have largely traded the top spots on Lyst’s Hottest Brands Index in recent quarters.

To this day, Abloh represents a creative community of anti-fashion luxury consumers, which LVMH quickly recognized a valuable viewpoint to bring into its traditionalist luxury fold. Following his appointment at Louis Vuitton, the group bought a 60 percent stake in Off-White in 2021, shortly before his death. Brand strategy director Yolanda O’Leary noted that the conglomerate is credited among the traditional luxury industry for recognizing his talent, welcoming the re-interpretation of luxury codes. “Gen Z is better understood as a mindset, as a youth outlook, and what Abloh did so well was to capture the imaginations of a youthful and influential global audience,” O’Leary explained.

Other LVMH brands have worked to appeal to Gen Z as well. 2018 also saw Kim Jones debut as LVMH-owned Dior mens’ creative director and launch the hypebeast-approved KAWS collaboration. In 2019, the French label also released their collaborative Air Jordan 1s – the stuff of luxe Gen Z dreams.

By 2022, streetwear codes are integral to LVMH brands, which suggests that the group will manage to maintain a huge influence over Gen Z without Abloh, as fashion commentator Hanan Besovic noted to Jing Daily. “Don’t get me wrong, his approach to Gen Z had a huge impact, but LVMH as a conglomerate still has brands that are targeting the mentioned-demographic. If we look at a brand like Celine's womenswear, it has a similar power over Gen Z. Or Matthew [M. Williams]'s Givenchy, which is trying to cater to that demographic in a completely different way.”

Abloh helped spearhead the streetwear-luxury crossover, with blockbuster collaborations now a successful formula within LVMH and beyond. If it wasn’t for his influence, perhaps the group would not have had the confidence to launch Dior’s partnership with Travis Scott (2021) or see Tiffany & Co. collaborate with skate label Supreme (2021).

“What inspired youth audiences was his energy, optimism and the values he championed – that reflected their own,” said O’Leary. “And I believe this impact can be sustained.” Of course, Abloh’s impact will literally live on through LVMH, thanks to his permanent projects such as the Black Database which he founded in 2020 – a database of Black talent for LVMH to work with. He also was reportedly behind the ongoing diversity panel to improve representation within the company.

""What inspired youth audiences was his energy, optimism and the values he championed – that reflected their own.""

Despite these permanent fixtures in place that will live beyond Abloh, there is uncertainty as to how LVMH will evolve without his streetwear innovation and zeitgeist-approved runway shows. Editor-in-Chief of StyleZeitgeist Eugene Rabkin believes that the group is secure among Gen Z consumers due to its massive capital: “LVMH’s most potent weapon is its bottomless marketing budget. Which is not to say that the artistic directors that they hire don’t matter, but I think what matters more is how they market the brand.”

In terms of Louis Vuitton, the question now is who will follow Abloh as creative director on the menswear side. Rumors currently favor independent designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose, who gained mainstream attention for their collaborations with Adidas and Nike, respectively.

“My money was on Ib Kamara, and I was close – he went to Off-White instead,” said Rabkin, agreeing that LVMH should honor the legacy of Abloh by hiring another Black talent. “My next guess is that it will be either Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss or Samuel Ross of A-Cold-Wall*. I don’t think that Martine Rose has enough of a profile with the hypebeast clientele.”

Louis Vuitton might now forever be associated with streetwear thanks to Abloh and his predecessor Jones, but as Besovic added, the brand still needs to innovate to remain relevant; “I think if they continue ‘the Virgil way’ it will not be authentic but it will feel like an attempt to keep the buzz and interest going,” he noted.

The question right now is how such a seismic buzz as produced by Abloh will be maintained moving forward in his absence. There just might be another unconventional creative director with a Gen Z fanbase ready to take the reins, or perhaps they will surprise with an unsuspected move that bids farewell to the era of Abloh.

Either way, thanks to Abloh, the scene has been set for LVMH to thrive in a new era of cross-industry collaboration and community-led creativity. But, it’s up to the company to pursue new directions without him. He ultimately walked so streetwear-loving Gen Z could run to LVMH.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999861717224121}",neutral,0.9999861717224121,0
LVMH Integrates Blockchain Technology Into Luxury Fashion - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvbHZtaC1hdXJhLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury fashion has been one of the biggest adopters of Web3 technologies in recent months with various brands accepting cryptocurrency as payments, along with names like TAG Heuer and Prada launching their own NFT integrations.

The overall embrace is likely due to the adoption of Web3 technologies by the brand’s parent company LVMH and the launch of its very own blockchain solution platform. For those unfamiliar, LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) is a French luxury goods conglomerate, headquartered in Paris and owns over 70 luxury fashion brands including names like Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe, Kenzo, Celine, and Tiffany & Co.

In what can be seen as a nod to the degens of the Web3 space, LVMH launched its very own blockchain on 4-20 of last year — the Aura Blockchain Consortium. Its founding members include Prada, Cartier, OTB Group, and most recently Mercedes Benz.

With a focus on providing a more immersive and tailored luxury experience, the group has already begun blending blockchain integrations into its physical offerings. Several products from different brands across the Consortium already have physical certificates accompanying them, providing increased proof of authenticity through blockchain technology.

Other integrations the Consortium is working on include traceability features, RFID and NFC utilization, along with NFT use-cases like a “digital twin.” These and more are being brought to life through a partnership with blockchain solutions company Temera.

One particular use of tracking is for the sake of sustainability, which is another priority the Consortium is focused on through its recent partnership with the Sustainable Markets Initiative.

It is a primary goal of the Consortium and its strategic partners to raise the standards of luxury goods and aims to do so by providing blockchain-based product tracking from start to finish — raw materials to consumer goods.

Winnie NYC's Idris Balogun on LVMH Prize and Phase Two of Business - WWD,"Mon, 01 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9tZW5zd2Vhci1uZXdzL21lbnMtZmFzaGlvbi93aW5uaWUtbnljcy1pZHJpcy1iYWxvZ3VuLWxhZ2VyZmVsZC1sdm1oLXByaXplLWZ1dHVyZS1wbGFucy0xMjM1MjY0NjA0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Winnie NYC founder and designer Idris Balogun is beginning phase two of his business.

The Nigerian designer born in New York and raised in the U.K. is a recent recipient of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize at the 2022 LVMH Prize Competition and plans to put his 150,000 euro winnings toward building e-commerce infrastructure, online marketing and hiring a product manager in Italy where the label is based.

Balogun set up shop in Vicenza to develop his contemporary men’s collection comprised of modern takes on traditional menswear, drawing from time spent in Nigeria during his childhood and his tutelage on Savile Row. Winnie NYC boasts luxe basics produced with a tailored sensibilities, like shirts with raglan sleeves, nuanced pockets and jackets and cargo pants. The label’s price point ranges from for $285 for a hoodie to $500 for trousers, and up to $1,745 for a sheepskin leather jacket.

Prior to launching Winnie NYC in 2018, Balogun was senior director of menswear for Tom Ford’s made-to-measure business, owned a factory in New York City where he produced his line, and though he’s now in Italy producing the label, the ultimate plan is to bring things back to New York.

Operating in Italy has its advantages. In addition to production, the brand is closer to Paris where it has been a regular at Paris Fashion Week since its second season.

Winnie NYC’s latest collection for spring 2023 showcases Balogun’s tailoring prowess, with suits, tuxedos and camp-collar shirts, alongside knit half-zip sweaters, cardigans and pullovers, sporty bomber jackets and boxing shorts in nontraditional fabrications. He aimed to subvert uniform stereotypes with this collection by making Wall Street-style suits more casual with 3D pockets, and sportswear more chic with cotton, and silk-blended fabrication on boxing shorts.

Since the label’s fall 2021 collection, Balogun has teamed with an artist for inspiration, beginning with Tau Lewis and the late South African contemporary visual artist Dumile Feni for the fall 2022 line. For spring 2023, he looked to artist Alida Rodrigues whose work on perception and identity informed the collection look book that has a half person, half plant modeling a double-breasted suit with zipped shoulder pocket. He also held an installation during Paris Fashion Week where clothes were suspended in midair and in different expressive formats, inviting attendees to feel the fabric and interact with the line.

“I discovered Alida’s work and I loved it and I decided to reach out to her,” Balogun said. “I don’t like to take directly from someone’s work. It was a true collaboration, because I pulled from conversations and what I want her work to represent. She was extremely involved and an amazing collaborator.”

Balogun was on a shortlist of designers invited to participate in the LVMH Prize in 2022, and along with Eli Russell Linnetz’ brand Erl, took home the Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize, 150,000 euros and a year of mentoring, though Steven Stokey-Daley of London brand S.S. Daley won the overall 2022 prize.

“It was crazy to be honest,” Balogun said of the experience. “One really amazing thing was meeting other designers that started brands during or through the pandemic. After being in the pandemic for so long, it felt good to have the judges see and feel the clothes.”

But his participation almost didn’t happen. Part of the collection was stuck in Customs so he took random past styles in his closet to augment the offering. “It worked in our favor, because the one comment we got is I could take [everything in] this booth and wear it and add it to my closet,” Balogun said.

It’s almost like Winnie NYC is divinely protected.

Balogun named the label after his grandmother who passed away prior to his 2018 launch. “She was so supportive of me and my career path and embarking on this fashion journey,” he said. “After she passed it was a moment of introspection. I’ve worked at Burberry [as director of menswear] and at Tom Ford, but I didn’t get to show her all of this. So I decided to start something in her name as an ode to her.”

Long before establishing his own label, Balogun, at 14 years old, went door to door asking for an apprenticeship and was eventually hired at Hardy Amies where he was recruited by Christopher Bailey who, at the time, was at Burberry as design director. “Bailey offered me a job but I didn’t do it because I didn’t know what design was,” Balogun said.

Instead, he moved to the U.S. to study at the Fashion Institute of Technology and to work for bespoke clothier Duncan Quinn. He finally joined Burberry in 2013 and then at Tom Ford, where he said he learned the most as a designer.

“Hardy was traditional craftsmanship and Burberry was a business that tried to cater to different customers. Tom Ford married the two. He took fashion as a scope with detail and scaling. It was almost Savile Row, and married the Burberry approach,” he said.

Phase one for Winnie NYC was growing the wholesale business, which has experienced “solid growth especially in the last three seasons,” Balogun said, due to lifted restrictions, merchandising and the look book. Bloomingdale’s, Ssense, Matchesfashion, Mytheresa, Highsnobiety, Nitty Gritty and 10 Corso Como are some of the retailers that have stocked his line and are expected to feature his pieces this fall. For spring 2023, new doors will include Eraldo and Quaranta in Italy, as well as Cave, Volga and Tessabit. Balogun’s aim, however, is to cap the number of wholesale accounts to 50 and grow with those retailers.

Phase two for Winnie NYC will focus on e-commerce, which is launching next season. Eventually, Balogun would like to open a store in the label’s namesake city.

“Phase three is to have a physical space in New York City where you’re thrown into the Winnie world,” he said. “There’s a café but it’s a showroom, and in the back, there’s a made-to-measure situation. Something front facing and [it will] be a Winnie hangout spot.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0
LVMH North America adds senior Nike lawyer as CLO - The Global Legal Post,"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGxlZ2FscG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EtYWRkcy1zZW5pb3ItbmlrZS1sYXd5ZXItYXMtY2xvLTE2NjUwODQ3MTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH North America has added a leading lawyer from Nike, Rodney Pratt, as senior vice president and chief legal officer. He will oversee LVMH's North American business and lead the legal team while also partnering with the LVMH Maisons to provide legal counsel on worldwide regulatory, corporate, litigation and commercial matters.

Pratt has succeeded longstanding SVP and GC Louise Firestone, who has retired after 23 years at LVMH. In a LinkedIn post, Firestone wrote that she was stepping down to enjoy retirement and follow a new path. ""My next chapter will include pro bono activities, board work, teaching, writing and I hope many wonderful surprises. I thank each of you who have accompanied me on this wonderful journey from the bottom of my heart,"" she wrote.

Pratt brings more than 20 years' legal experience to his new role, serving most recently as VP, office of the general counsel operations, innovation and strategic iniatives at Nike. Prior to that he spent seven years as VP and GC at Converse and had a three-year stint as assistant general counsel at Nike. He began his legal career as a lawyer at Dickstein Shapiro in Washington DC.

An adjunct professor at Howard University School of Law, Pratt co-teaches a course on sports and social justice and is involved in a number of community activities including serving as co-founder and board member of the Boston-based New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund and as co-chair of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association’s advisory board.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999983549118042}",neutral,0.999983549118042,0
Avantium provides plant-based PEF to produce recyclable packaging for LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics - Packaging Europe,"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3BhY2thZ2luZ2V1cm9wZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hdmFudGl1bS1wcm92aWRlcy1wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1wZWYtdG8tcHJvZHVjZS1yZWN5Y2xhYmxlLXBhY2thZ2luZy1mb3ItbHZtaC1wZXJmdW1lcy1hbmQtY29zbWV0aWNzLzg1OTUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Avantium has signed an agreement with luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Group (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) to secure a fixed volume of the plant-based, fully recyclable polymer polyethylene furanoate (PEF) for their cosmetics packaging. It is hoped to be a step towards the commercial launch of a new and sustainable packaging material.

Avantium’s new FDCA Flagship Plant is currently under construction; the company claims it to be the world’s first commercial plant to produce furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from plant-based sugars. FDCA is an essential component in creating PEF, which they say is a stronger and more protective material than the average petroleum-based plastic – leading to superior product protection and reducing the amount of packaging required in any one product.

Reportedly, trials of PEF packaging for LVMH beauty brands such as Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Guerlain have been successful. Packaging the products in this material is hoped to encourage the wider introduction of PEF in the cosmetics market and contribute towards a circular economy.

Claude Martinez, executive president and managing director of the Beauty Division of LVMH Group, comments, “As part of our social and environmental strategy “LIFE 360” (LVMH Initiative for the Environment), LVMH Beauty is always looking for sustainable materials with superior performance for our luxury products. The environmental and performance features of PEF are unique and meet our sustainable packaging goals without any compromise on quality.

“We are pleased to collaborate with Avantium and help to enable the commercial introduction of PEF to the cosmetics market.”

Tom van Aken, CEO of Avantium, adds, “We are delighted that LVMH has adopted PEF as a sustainable solution for its cosmetics packaging. We look forward to supporting LVMH’s sustainability strategy “LIFE 360” and the company’s target of zero plastic from virgin fossil feedstock, while delivering a high-quality, innovative packaging material that the luxury consumers of LVMH may expect.”

The news comes after LVMH’s participation in the PEFerence consortium coordinated by Avantium earlier this year. The flagship project facilitated cooperation between various leading brands and value chain partners to encourage the commercialisation of PEF.

In another integration of PEF into product packaging, Avantium joined forces with Paboco and the Paper Bottle Community to produce the Generation 2.0 Fibre Bottle for Carlsberg Group.

LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics has previously collaborated with speciality material provider Eastman to develop packaging that utilises molecular recycling technologies.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999265670776367}",positive,0.9999265670776367,1
"LVMH ties make Trapani 'inappropriate' for board, says Richemont - Vogue Business","Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXRpZXMtbWFrZS10cmFwYW5pLWluYXBwcm9wcmlhdGUtZm9yLWJvYXJkLXNheXMtcmljaGVtb250LWJsdWViZWxs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Richemont is urging against activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners’s suggestion of electing ex-Bulgari CEO Francesco Trapani to its board, arguing that his ties to rival LVMH make him “an inappropriate candidate”. It is the latest in an ongoing corporate governance battle that could shift the internal balance of power away from long-standing Richemont chairman Johann Rupert.

Read More Richemont vs Bluebell: The corporate governance battle heats up Activist investor Bluebell is pushing for ex-Bulgari head Francesco Trapani to be added to the luxury conglomerate’s board — but Richemont is offering up its own internal candidate. Will founder Johann Rupert come around?

In a letter to shareholders sent today ahead of Richemont’s annual general meeting on 7 September, Rupert argued that electing Trapani to the board would not be in the “interest of the company” because of his employment history. Trapani was named chief executive of Bulgari in 1984, and oversaw its $5.2 billion acquisition by LVMH in 2011. He became LVMH’s head of watches and jewellery from 2011 to 2014, and sat on Tiffany’s executive board from 2017 to 2019, when it was acquired by LVMH for $15.8 billion.

""LVMH is one of our company's key competitors,” Rupert wrote. “The board may not responsibly recommend to shareholders to let a person who has a long history of association with that group — as well as a personal relationship with that group's main shareholder — become a director of our company and intervene in our company's decision-making process.”

Bluebell has been calling for Richemont to alter its board structure, which it argues does not represent public shareholders and favours Rupert’s interests. It wants to install Trapani – its former director and co-founder – as a representative of all of Richemont’s “Class A” shareholders. Richemont is instead proposing the board elect Wendy Luhabe, who has been on the board since 2020, to represent the Class A shareholders. Bluebell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Stella’s vegan and cruelty-free line skincare line aims to be natural, effective and environmentally responsible.

“I am delighted that Stella McCartney, after pioneering a sustainable and responsible luxury fashion, is now partnering with LVMH, committed to change the codes of cosmetics, the packaging and the ingredients,” says Antoine Arnault, image and environment, LVMH. “The launch of Stella by Stella McCartney perfectly resonates with the group’s longstanding commitment toward sustainability and we are proud to support it.”

Based on Stella’s personal philosophy of using ‘only what you need,’ the range consists of three products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream. The line-up is a culmination of three years’ worth of exploration with LVMH Recherche, the group’s Beauty R&D unit.

“We set out with an idea, and because we didn’t want to compromise – on outstanding results, the origin of our ingredients and, of course, ensuring we minimize our impact on Mother Earth – we kept on trying,” says McCartney. “We worked hard for almost three years with LVMH, constantly evolving and aiming for what I felt was possible: rooted in nature, truly effective and responsible skincare. It’s a game changer and I want to share it with everyone. I believe the consumer needs to know there’s another way, that they have a choice.”

All product formulas are made with at least 99% natural-origin ingredients, and each is available in an eco-conscious refill.

All the products will be available on www.stellamccartneybeauty.com and through a selection of U.K. retailers and boutiques including the Stella McCartney U.K. flagship store on Old Bond Street from early September and Space NK from mid-September.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.915570080280304}",neutral,0.915570080280304,0
How do you turn an NFT into a luxury good? Lessons from Tiffany and Dictador - Style,"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg5MTYyL2hvdy1kby15b3UtdHVybi1uZnQtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2QtbHZtaHMtdGlmZmFueS1jby1hbmTSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzE4OTE2Mi9ob3ctZG8teW91LXR1cm4tbmZ0LWx1eHVyeS1nb29kLWx2bWhzLXRpZmZhbnktY28tYW5k?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The challenge: many of these projects create no value and no desirability. For example, during the Super Bowl, one well-known brand created a metaverse event that was marketed in a significant way. Sadly, it was a party where, besides the hosts, almost no one came. The few visitors who joined with their Oculus Quest virtual reality devices found themselves in a virtually abandoned space. Not a great signal to the digitally savvy Gen Z audience that the brand was trying to attract.

The number of metaverse projects in luxury seems almost infinite. Practically every day there is a new initiative launched somewhere in the world, whether it’s an NFT collection, virtual real estate or a game.

It’s one of many examples where brands try to rush metaverse projects without doing their homework on a few parameters: why should someone engage? How is the value created? What is the endgame? Who is the audience on a platform?

Many metaverse platforms have a high proportion of kids in their teens and even younger (often masked when their parents sign them up), far from those that brands want to be targeting. Brands sometimes spend millions of dollars on channels where they meet the wrong audience or where they meet literally no one. It may help a little to get the word out in a press release, but initiatives like these can have a fatal effect on brand equity.

The same goes for many NFTs. What many brands forget is that an NFT without a story is the same as a blank canvas. On its own it’s worth nothing. What makes it valuable is the artwork and the story it tells through the talent and fame of the artist. And yet, many brands launch endless NFTs that are dead on arrival. They do it to be part of the hype and due to FOMO.

However, there are bright spots – great examples of digital assets created that have the potential to appreciate in value over time, similar to physical luxury items like the Hermès Birkin bag , that has been increasing constantly in value over the last 20 years. One of them is the ArtHouse Spirits DAO by Dictador, often described as the world’s most luxurious rum.

The brand has a long history of important collaborations with artists. Some of Dictador’s physical rum bottles achieve prices of US$100,000 and more, like those in the 5 Decades project: ultra-rare rum, stored for more than five decades and offered in one-off-bottles crafted by Richard Orlinski. Even the distillery in Colombia has become a spectacular art exhibition space where artists get total freedom to express their creativity.

These NFTs designed by artist Mariusz Waras for Dictador act as tokens signifying membership of DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) which safeguards a store of rare rums. Photo: ArtHouse Spirits Dao

In this spirit, Dictador collaborated with the artist Mariusz Waras to develop a futuristic collection of NFTs based around an artistic representation of a city map. All of the NFTs act as membership tokens to the DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation), which will manage a treasury of some of the rarest rums. The DAO members decide on the use of the treasury. A limited number of the NFTs can be transformed into a physical bottle with rum out of the treasury, with the representation of the NFT transferred onto a meticulously sculpted bottle.

I asked Marek Szoldrowski, Dictador’s president, what was critical to his team in differentiating the project: “We wanted to make sure that our DAO and our NFTs are backed by real-world assets, so that we give significant substance and maximise the potential for a value increase over time. Individually designing each NFT was an important component too, the artistic aspect is critical. We see it as the next generation investment, art with financial potential. The treasury value has already achieved US$1.5 million at presale.”

The public sale of ArtHouse Spirits DAO started on August 15, with the first 1,000 buyers gaining the opportunity to buy a unique work of art too.

Another exciting example is Tiffany & Co., the famed American jeweller now owned by LVMH . Their custom CryptoPunk NFTiff pendants going for US$50,000 each sold out immediately. The edition was limited to 250 units and was offered exclusively to holders of CryptoPunks , a collection of 10,000 eight-bit inspired characters on the Ethereum blockchain.

Each NFTiff can be redeemed for a custom Tiffany & Co. pendant, which, similar to Dictador’s DAO, connects a tangible real-world value and the story of a personalised choice to the value creation model.

The exclusive nature of the offer points to the future of brand collaborations and client communities. It’s also a clever model to test a new collection with minimum investment into inventory.

Using the NFT as the “digital twin” of the pendant, Tiffany & Co. was able to sense demand and create something of extraordinary value for a very specific target group. On top of that, the project can boost brand interest and conversations among people who would otherwise not consider the brand, helping position Tiffany & Co. well beyond its usual habitat of engagement rings . In other words, opening use cases and purchase opportunities. This is why being strategic about digital assets and communities is so critical and why metaverse projects should never be done as a tactical experiment or as a measure to generate some short-term hype.

Additionally, creating innovative digital brand communities is not just about a gathering of a group of like-minded people – there is also the possibility of long-term brand engagement, connection with clients and providing exclusive access to opportunities not available to others. This is a benefit that money can’t buy. To use my definition of luxury, it is “extreme value creation”, not just a blank canvas.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995779395103455}",neutral,0.9995779395103455,0

Some luxury consumers are 'utterly immune' to inflation: Former LVMH exec - Yahoo Finance,"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zb21lLWx1eHVyeS1jb25zdW1lcnMtYXJlLXV0dGVybHktaW1tdW5lLXRvLWluZmxhdGlvbi1mb3JtZXItbHZtaC1leGVjLTEyMjIzNjk2My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the U.S. continues to wrestle with economic uncertainty and inflation, demand for luxury goods has remained strong. But that may be starting to change, at least for part of the luxury market.

According to Pauline Brown, former LVMH Chairman of North America, there are two types of luxury consumers, and they're responding differently as inflation wears on.

""There are the uber affluent and then there's the aspirational consumer,"" Brown told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). She added that recent earnings ""indicate that at least on the margin of luxury goods, that there is some fraying. But there is also a segment of buyer that is utterly immune to the kind of forces that we're talking about.”

Brown explained that retailers like Ralph Lauren (RL) and Capri Holdings (CPRI), which owns Versace and Michael Kors, are more dependent on aspirational consumers whereas LVMH (LVMUY) and Gucci-owner Kering (KER.PA) rely on the ""core"" affluent consumer.

Ralph Lauren and Capri beat Wall Street expectations in the second quarter, though the European fashion houses held up even better, Brown said. LVMH and Kering both reported revenue growth of over 20% in the first half of the year despite macroeconomic pressures.

As the overall retail sector faced a series of setbacks in recent months, Brown stated that luxury conglomerates remained steady because wealthy consumers were paying full price and buying in volume.

""That's great for the bottom line of these companies,"" Brown said. Consumers are “just not looking for discounts in the way that they historically have, number one, because there's a lot of occasions. There's travel, and there's weddings, and there's other celebrations. And that is a big impetus for people to go into the stores.""

The current environment marks a significant shift from the ""very promotional environment"" the luxury sector faced at the height of the pandemic.

And as the sector continues to rebound, year-over-year comparisons are also looking more favorable.

Story continues

""I would say that in general, with the exception, maybe, of what's happening with the China consumer, which has slowed down for reasons that go above and beyond COVID and post-COVID, that the U.S. consumer, which is consistently showing the fastest growth, is still in a pretty healthy recovery mode from a year ago, and even from two years ago,"" Brown said.

And while the affluent buyer continues to shop for Louis Vuitton and Chanel at full price, aspirational consumers are looking elsewhere for contemporary brands, such as in the resale market and online marketplaces like Poshmark.

""They might buy what we call the sort of mid-tier or the bridge price points,"" Brown said. ""And for them, it's giving them access to those better brands at prices they can still afford.""

Those platforms arent going away, Brown acknowledged, but ""there's a natural limitation on how many people will go above and beyond designer handbags, jewelry, and, to a lesser extent, ready-to-wear.""

With this year’s theme, “Future’s Past,” the event at a private location will showcase fashion’s future and aims to support further progress for diversity, equality and inclusion in the fashion world.

In addition, HFR will introduce an award in honor of the late Virgil Abloh, which will be given by his wife, Shannon Abloh. The award will recognize individuals who embody Abloh’s spirit, brilliance and vision through contributions to culture, community and innovation, according to HFR. Abloh, the former artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear collection and founder of Off-White, died Nov. 21, 2021.

This year’s award winners are actress, writer and producer Issa Rae, who will receive the inaugural Virgil Abloh Award presented by LVMH; Sergio Hudson, who will receive Designer of the Year; Robin Givhan, senior critic at large for The Washington Post, who will receive Editor of the Year; Ade Samuel, Stylist of the Year, and Janet Jackson, who will receive Icon of the Year.

Brandice Daniel, chief executive officer and founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row, said, “African Americans have a rich history in fashion, although much of their contributions have been buried or unrecognized in history. However, HFR would not exist without the work of Black designers like Lois Alexander Lane, who created the Harlem Institute of Fashion and the Black Fashion Museum. We also would not exist without the work of other sartorial pioneers like Anne Lowe, Elizabeth Keckley and Eunice Johnson. We are moving into the future by reaching back to understand, honor and pull strength from our past.”

Through an ongoing partnership with HFR, LMVH continues its commitment to work toward a more diverse, equitable and inclusive fashion industry. Several brands from the LVMH portfolio will help celebrate the next generation of diverse fashion talent by supporting aspects of the Fashion Show & Style Awards. For example, Sephora will provide runway hair products from Black-owned brands that are part of the 15 Percent Pledge program created by Aurora James; Dior Beauty will sponsor all the skin care, makeup and artistry teams; Tiffany & Co. will present gifts to Style Award honorees and designers during the event, and Moët Hennessy USA will provide drinks for cocktail hour.

“As LVMH looks to the future of our group and maisons through the lens of diversity, equity and inclusion, we are thrilled to partner with Harlem’s Fashion Row on their 15th anniversary celebration, and to cast a spotlight on the cultural richness and creativity of the Harlem community,” said Anish Melwani, chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. “The success of LVMH’s maisons stems from their ability to reveal creative talents from across the world, and we are excited to support the New York Fashion Week debut of three talented BIPOC designers from our neighboring community of Harlem.”

The three Black, Indigenous and people of color designers who will showcase their latest collections in the show will be Clarence Ruth and his brand Cotte D’Armes, who will show menswear; Johnathan Hayden, whose namesake brand will show sustainable womenswear, and Nicole Benefield, whose namesake label will show womenswear.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978653788566589}",neutral,0.9978653788566589,0

LVMH set new records in 2021 as shoppers returned in force to buy the luxury goods it sells online and in-store in 2021, reports the RetailX Luxury Sector report.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported revenues of €64.2bn (£53.4bn) in 2021 – 44% up on 2020, which was hit by the pandemic – and 20% ahead of pre-pandemic 2019. Profit from recurring operations came in at €17.1bn (£14.2bn), more than double (+107%) the €8.3bn (£6.9bn) reported in 2021, and 49% up on 2019 and the group reported net financial income after expenses and before tax of €53m (£44m), an improvement from a loss of €608m (£505m) in 2020 and a loss of €559m (£464.6m) in 2019.

The group’s brands include Louis Vuitton, ranked Leading in RXUK Top500 research, Christian Dior, whose Dior website is ranked Top150, and Fendi, ranked Top500 as well as Celine and Loewe, which all achieved record sales and profitability. Online sales grew.

In its perfume and cosmetics division where organic revenue – a measure that combines like-for-like with constant currency – grew by 27% on last year and was stable on 2019, “LVMH’s major brands chose to continue a policy of selective distribution, limiting promotions and growing online sales on their own website.” Christian Dior’s Sauvage became the highest selling fragrance in the world, a first for a male fragrance – although that growth includes women’s lines.

And in its selective retailing division (organic revenue +18% on 2020, -18% on 2019), Sephora saw a strong rebound in its business, bought beauty pureplay Feelunique – which is ranked Top250 in RXUK research – during the year and signed a partnership with Zalando.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, says: “LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis. The Group’s record results could not have been achieved without the efficiency and exceptional ability of our teams to adapt and notably to remain connected to our customers, continuing to inspire dreams, despite the crisis.”

He paid tribute to Virgil Abloh, men’s artistic director of Louis Vuitton since 2018, who died during 2021. He also said the group had worked to promote biodiversity, protect nature and preserve skills and craftsmanship during the year.

And he adds: “Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence and are convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to further strengthen its lead in the global luxury market.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",positive,0.9999988079071045,1

New York native Clarence Ruth began his career as an artist, with his work displayed at Polk Museum of Art and the African Museum of Art. After enjoying a successful career as an artist and fashion model, he decided to merge his two passions and display his artistic expression through clothing. Clarence served as head of visuals for Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, John Varvatos, and Andrew Buckler, before launching his own menswear label, Cotte D’Armes. Inspired by the essence of military infused with street chic biker, his denim and clothing evoke a sense of rebel darkness and individuality.

Contemporary women’s wear designer Johnathan Hayden is a master of sustainable separates. He seeks to harmonize modernity with classic craftsmanship, often listening to the needs of women in STEM-related fields to incorporate tech in his designs. Striving to achieve better beauty, Johnathan Hayden creates clean, conscious, and creative designs, rotating staple styles with new couture techniques for women who want clothing that lasts lifetimes. Johnathan is intent to dress the modern intellect, and designs for those who navigate the world brain before body.

Nicole Benefield’s design aesthetic is rooted in casual sophistication. The intent is to create clothing that is approachable with thoughtful details, and effortless fabrications, in modern proportions. She is an advocate for being driven by emotion over trend and appreciates form and wearability. Nicole Benefield Portfolio is a slow fashion brand that is committed to developing responsibly. The collection is a combination of styles in organic, biodegradable, or deadstock fabrics that are made in small batches to avoid overproduction. This adaptive method of production is a responsible approach to fashion and an appreciation for consuming meaningfully.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0

Arnault, the 72-year-old CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has built his fortune over the span of almost four decades, amassing an empire that includes some of the best-known names in fashion, jewellery and alcohol, including Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer and Dom Pérignon.

When it comes to the world of luxury goods, no one is more successful than Bernard Arnault.

Here’s how Arnault got his start and became one of the richest people in the world.

The 73-year-old French businessman is the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, known as LVMH. Arnault owns a 97.5 per cent stake in Christian Dior, which controls 41.2 per cent of LVMH.

Arnault comes from the northern French town of Roubaix and studied engineering at one of France’s most prestigious schools, the École Polytechnique. After graduating, Arnault went to work for his father’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel.

In 1984, Arnault acquired an ailing company called Agache-Willot-Boussac, which owned brands like French department store Le Bon Marché and the fashion house Christian Dior. He renamed the firm Financière Agache and initiated a turnaround, cutting costs and selling off some of its businesses. Soon after, he bought fashion house Celine and funded the French designer Christian Lacroix.

In the late 1980s, Arnault said his goal was to run the world’s largest luxury company within the following decade. He then set his sights on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, spending US$2.6 billion buying up shares to become the company’s largest shareholder, and eventually its chairman and CEO, by 1989.

Arnault married Anne Dewavrin in 1973, and they had two children together before separating in 1990. Arnault remarried in 1991, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist. He reportedly wooed her by playing Chopin and other classical composers.

Like many of his fellow billionaires, Arnault lives a lavish life. He travels by private jet, owns a sprawling holiday villa in glitzy Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, and reportedly has also spent at least US$96.4 million on residential properties in the Los Angeles area: in Beverly Hills, the Trousdale Estates and Hollywood Hills.

The French billionaire and his wife live on Paris’s Left Bank, south of the Seine River, a historic area that includes neighbourhoods such as the Latin Quarter and St Germain-des-Prés.

In their home, Arnault keeps a collection of modern and contemporary art from artists that include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol, and Pablo Picasso.

Arnault has five children: two (Delphine and Antoine) with his first wife and three ( Alexandre Frédéric , and Jean) with his current wife.

Delphine, Arnault’s oldest daughter, is the apparent heiress to the LVMH empire. She started her career at American consultancy firm McKinsey in Paris and is now the executive vice-president at Louis Vuitton. In January 2019, Delphine became the youngest member of LVMH’s executive committee at age 43.

Delphine married Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in 2005 in what Forbes called at the time “France’s wedding of the year”. They divorced in 2010. She now reportedly lives with tech billionaire Xavier Niel and has one daughter. Delphine is notoriously private about her personal life. In a 2014 interview with the Financial Times, she said, “I’m quite discreet. I think I’d rather focus on my work.”

Delphine’s younger brother Antoine is chief executive of menswear label Berluti and chair of the cashmere label Loro Piana, both LVMH brands. In addition to those roles, Antoine was named head of communications and image for LVMH in June 2018.

He’s married to supermodel Natalia Vodianova, whom he reportedly met on a shoot for a 2008 Louis ­Vuitton campaign when he was the brand’s head of communications. The couple lives in Paris with their two children and Vodianova’s three children from a previous marriage.

Alexandre, the son of Bernard Arnault and Mercier, is an executive at Tiffany. LVMH acquired Tiffany in 2021, after which Alexandre became the company’s executive vice-president of product and communications.

Before moving over to Tiffany, Alexandre was the CEO of Rimowa , a German luggage brand owned by LVMH. Alexandre is long-time friends with Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap. Spiegel told The New York Times that Alexandre is “a really creative guy” and that “he’s constantly thinking about the brand and how to express that”.

Alexandre’s younger brother Frédéric is the CEO of Tag Heuer . Frédéric joined LVMH as the temporary head of connected technologies at Tag Heuer in 2017. A year later, he became strategy and digital director at the Swiss watch company, LVMH’s largest watch brand. In 2020, Frédéric was named Tag Heuer’s CEO.

Frédéric graduated from his father’s alma mater, École Polytechnique in Paris, and interned at Facebook and consulting firm McKinsey before joining LVMH.

Arnault’s youngest son, Jean, joined the family business in 2021. He became marketing and product director in Louis Vuitton’s watch division in August 2021. Jean, who was 23 at the time, has a master’s degree in financial mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a master’s in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London, WWD reported.

According to his LinkedIn profile, he interned at Morgan Stanley and McLaren Racing and worked in a Louis Vuitton retail store before joining the company full-time.

Arnault has rubbed shoulders with some of the planet’s most influential figures, in the fashion world and otherwise.

In 2017, Arnault met President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, right before Trump’s inauguration, to discuss expanding LVMH factories in the US. The company opened a new 100,000 sq ft Louis Vuitton factory in Texas in 2019, the company’s third factory in the US.

Arnault was reportedly friends with Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jobs once said to Arnault: “You know, Bernard, I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success, but I can tell you, I’m sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon.”

Former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein once called Arnault “a complete visionary”, adding that he “saw the increase of wealth in the world”.

Arnault is reportedly long-time friends with former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and was a witness at Sarkozy’s wedding to singer and model Carla Bruni.

Arnault considered the legendary designer and Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld a good friend.

“The death of this dear friend deeply saddens me, my wife and my children,” Arnault said in a statement upon Lagerfeld’s death in 2019. “We loved and admired him deeply. Fashion and culture has lost a great inspiration.”

But Arnault also has a long-standing public rivalry: with François Pinault, the founder of luxury group Kering, who’s worth about US$37 billion. Kering owns brands including Gucci and Yves St Laurent. The billionaire also owns Christie’s auction house.

LVMH originally tried to acquire a majority stake in Gucci in 1999, but Pinault ultimately snatched up the brand.

Over the years, Arnault has built LVMH into the largest luxury conglomerate in the world and earned himself an imposing nickname: “the wolf in the cashmere coat”.

He’s behind the creation of Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum and performance space in Paris, that opened in 2014.

In April 2019, LVMH released a statement on behalf of the Arnault family, pledging €200 million to help rebuild the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was heavily damaged in a 2019 fire.

In October 2020, Arnault’s company bought Tiffany for US$15.8 billion in the luxury sector’s biggest deal. The contentious sale involved multiple lawsuits and a US$400 million price drop.

When it comes to finances, the past few years have been a roller-coaster ride for Arnault and LVMH.

In January 2019, Arnault made US$4.3 billion in a single day after LVMH shares surged 6.9 per cent. And just six months later, on June 19, 2019, Arnault again made news when he became the third person in the world to reach a US$100 billion net worth.

Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and pandemic-related shutdowns sank LVMH’s stock, sending Arnault’s personal net worth down more than US$30 billion by May 2020.

But as the world opened up again, LVMH’s stock recovered, thanks to strong sales in fashion and leather goods and an uptick in alcohol sales, particularly champagne.

It’s been a good year so far for the company: it recorded €36.7 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022, up 28 per cent from the same period in 2021.

Arnault remains the world’s third-richest person, behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, with a fortune worth US$137 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999924898147583}",neutral,0.9999924898147583,0
Tod's to delist from Milan in bid to revive growth - Vogue Business,"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hLXllYXItYWZ0ZXItbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXRvZHMtdG8tZGVsaXN0LWZyb20tbWlsYW4tc3RvY2stZXhjaGFuZ2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

The Della Valle family behind Italian luxury shoemaker Tod’s said it plans to delist the company from the Milan-based stock exchange as it seeks to revive the underperforming luxury group.

The family said it would spend up to €338 million to buy out other investors at €40 a share, valuing the company at €1.32 billion. The family currently owns nearly 64.45 per cent of the company, but plans to obtain 90 per cent ownership. The group owns Tod’s, French footwear brand Roger Vivier, Italian luxury sneaker brand Hogan and US outerwear brand Fay. Last year, LVMH increased its stake in the company from 3.2 per cent to 10 per cent after chairman Diego Della Valle signalled his intention to stand back from day-to-day management as well as an openness to a potential sale.

Public since 2000, Tod’s has struggled to keep up with the rest of the luxury industry, with analysts saying the company missed out on key trend opportunities such as sneakers. It returned to pre-pandemic growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, with sales steadily rebounding following pandemic setbacks. In May, the company recorded a 23 per cent increase in sales over last year, to €219.6 million for the first three months. Returning to private ownership would remove the need to report quarterly results and allow for investment for more long-term growth.

The goal is to “enhance the value of the group's individual brands owned by the company, giving them strong individual visibility and great operational autonomy”, a statement from the company reads. Privatising the company is an important investment, the company says, as it hopes to “strengthen the positioning of [its] brands” in the luxury market.

A $200 million sustainability fund was launched earlier this month as a result of a collaboration between Stella McCartney and the venture capital firm Collaborative Fund.

The sustainability-focused designer also recently collaborated with Bolt Threads — the first company that received investment from the sustainability fund — to develop the first commercially available luxury bag made from mushroom leather.

Stella X LVMH

LVMH is a French luxury company that owns several high fashion labels, including Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, and Christian Dior. The successful collaboration with LVMH started in 2019 when the fashion powerhouse announced a tie-up with Stella McCartney.

Stella McCartney is now preparing for the launch of the STELLA beauty brand in collaboration with the LVMH beauty division. The line is claimed to draw inspiration from nature while minimising its environmental impact. The brand will make its debut in September through the Stella McCartney Beauty website and will further be available through a selection of UK retailers and boutiques including the Stella McCartney UK flagship store on Old Bond Street from early September and Space NK from mid-September.

Three eco-friendly products are part of the line: Reset Cleanser ($60), Alter-Care Serum ($140), and Restore Cream ($105). All the items are silicone-free, vegan, cruelty-free, and refillable. According to the firm, the composition is made up of 99% natural ingredients, with “the remaining less than 1% synthetic substances being there to protect the products integrity over time,” according to the company.

“We set out with an idea, and because we didn’t want to compromise – on outstanding results, the origin of our ingredients, and, of course, ensuring we minimised our impact on Mother Earth – we kept on trying. We worked hard for almost three years with LVMH constantly evolving and aiming for what I felt was possible: rooted in nature, truly effective and responsible skincare. It’s a game changer and I want to share it with everyone. I believe the consumer needs to know there’s another way, that they have a choice.” said Stella McCartney.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999054491519928}",neutral,0.999054491519928,0
LVMH Must Drop Fur and Exotic Skins Ahead of 2024 Olympic Games – Here's Why - PETA UK,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnLnVrL2Jsb2cvbHZtaC1kcm9wLWZ1ci1leG90aWMtc2tpbnMtb2x5bXBpYy1nYW1lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In response to reports that LVMH – owner of Louis Vuitton and Fendi – is set to be an official sponsor of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, PETA sent a letter to International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach. We are urging him to greenlight LVMH’s sponsorship only if the fashion company agrees to stop selling fur and exotic skins, as the production of those items is not only horrifically cruel to animals but also a known pandemic risk.

Public Health Hazard

Fur farms in multiple countries, including Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the US, saw outbreaks of COVID-19 among animals and workers, and a dangerous mutation of the virus spread from minks to humans.

Experts have now warned that the unsanitary and crowded conditions on farms and at slaughterhouses in the exotic-skins supply chain are a perfect breeding ground for viruses such as the one that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

LVMH has so far failed to act responsibly and continues to risk the public’s health with its mink coats and python bags. We all know the enormous toll COVID-19 took on lives around the globe, so it would be unconscionable for the next Olympic Games to be sponsored by a company that supports these dangerous industries.

Investigations Reveal the Cruelty Behind Exotic Skins and Fur

A PETA Asia investigation into two Indonesian slaughterhouses that supply LVMH showed workers striking pythons repeatedly on the head then suspending them in the air and forcing hoses down their throats to inflate them with water, making it easier to remove their skin.

Workers disembowelled the snakes while they were likely still conscious.

PETA Asia has also documented that rabbits were bludgeoned and chinchillas electrocuted for their fur, while minks and sables were driven to insanity by the extreme confinement they experience in the fur trade.

Compassion Is In – Exotic Skins and Fur Are Out

Torturing animals for handbags or coats is archaic and unacceptable – especially when high-end vegan options are available. Fashion should be fun, not fatal, and more and more designers, including Burberry, Calvin Klein, Chanel, and Victoria Beckham, are banning fur and exotic skins from their collections.

Pythons and Chinchillas Need Your Help

Please join PETA in calling on LVMH to drop exotic skins and fur from Louis Vuitton and its other brands right now!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9152984619140625}",neutral,0.9152984619140625,0
"Hermès, the family that united against LVMH's 'Wolf in Cashmere' - Le Monde","Mon, 01 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL3N1bW1lci1yZWFkcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDgvMDEvaGVybWVzLXRoZS1mYW1pbHktdGhhdC11bml0ZWQtYWdhaW5zdC1sdm1oLXMtd29sZi1pbi1jYXNobWVyZV81OTkyMTU4XzE4My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investigation'Successions season II' (2/6). This dynasty of French luxury was long undermined by rivalry. Until the day in 2011 when a hostile raid by LVMH boss Bernard Arnault led the many heirs to unite and stand together, to defend what they call 'la maison'

To dive into the heart of the Hermès dynasty is to experience elegance and good taste – the best shroud for family secrets. Every cousin introduces themself with exquisite courtesy, giving you a moment to try to remember what side of the family tree they are from. As you search your memory, you are offered a darjeeling in a lovely tea set. The setting is a Parisian museum, opened sparingly to hand-picked guests by company leadership. Here, you can admire the collection of the dynasty's common ancestor Emile Hermès. It was reconstructed over the years through acquisitions at auctions: a selection of trunks with intricate locks, side-saddles and paper trompe-l'oeils. Facing so many marvels, it is hard to imagine that 10 years ago, the luxury industry's royal family almost lost everything, staggering from the blows of the industry, the boss of LVMH himself: Bernard Arnault.

In this Protestant tribe, even vocabulary is carefully chosen. Don't say ""company,"" say ""maison,"" or house. Don't say ""expensive,"" but ""costly."" And never say ""marketing department"" – how vulgar! In the workshops, the craftsmen who cut and sew soft leather into bags seem to be regarded with the same esteem as those in charge. On weekends, CEO Axel Dumas strolls around in jeans and a white shirt among the bookstores of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in Paris, without anyone guessing that he belongs to one of the richest French families. Its fortune was valued at 78.7 billion euros in 2022, with 300 stores around the world, 17,000 employees and a company posting a net income of 2.445 billion euros in 2021. This unwavering success was even further consolidated during the pandemic.

'It's a bit like Ukraine'

We were therefore a little taken aback when someone who knows the ""house"" very well told us, out of the blue: ""You know, the Hermès family is a bit like Ukraine. The culture and know-how are magnificent, with three branches whose ties are a little loose, a third of them tax exiles, and a fortune that ranks them among the richest people in France. And then suddenly, just at the time of succession, war breaks out. A war that threatens independence and brings everyone together around the country.” And there, the bags, scarves and silk ties parted like a stage curtain, sheding light on the moment the dynasty almost tore itself apart.

So let's go back a bit, to 2010. Hermès was 173 years old, but for the first time, after six generations, there was no longer a family member in charge. Four years earlier, Jean-Louis Dumas – the mythical heir who, over the course of a quarter of a century, globalized the company and brought it to the forefront of luxury craftsmanship – had to give way to his loyal number two, Patrick Thomas. Jean-Louis – as all the Hermès staff affectionately called the cheerful and charismatic man – could no longer hide the effects of Parkinson's and Charcot's diseases. On May 1, 2010, he passed away slowly, and left the house trembling: no successor was ready.

Why is Hermès skipping out on the second-hand luxury market? - Style,"Tue, 02 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg3MzE4L3doeS1oZXJtZXMtc2tpcHBpbmctb3V0LXNlY29uZC1oYW5kLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXQtbHZtaNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg3MzE4L3doeS1oZXJtZXMtc2tpcHBpbmctb3V0LXNlY29uZC1oYW5kLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXQtbHZtaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Unlike Kering, which has invested in reseller Vestiaire Collective and sells some of its labels on platforms for pre-owned wares, Hermès sees the second-hand market as a threat, saying it drives up prices and can fuel counterfeiting.

Birkin bag maker Hermès is not interested in getting involved in the fast-growing second-hand luxury market which has attracted some its rivals, its chief Axel Dumas said on Friday, July 29.

“It would be to the detriment of our regular client who comes to the store,” Dumas told analysts following strong first half results when asked if he had engaged with any reseller.

Luxury brands have traditionally been wary of second-hand dealers, but rising interest in pre-owned fashion from younger, environmentally conscious shoppers has prompted some labels to reconsider their position.

Hermès is renowned in the industry for its careful management of production and stocks, which have helped maintain its aura of exclusivity.

It has output caps so that demand for its high-end handbags always exceeds supply . Its coveted US$10,000 plus Birkin model generates waiting lists and can sometimes cost more on the resale market than in Hermès stores.

The group does not sell its prized handbags online.

“Demand has always been higher than our offer, we’ve been confronted with this for years,” Dumas said, adding the group would not produce more if it meant compromising on quality.

The company has limited growth in its leather goods production 6 per cent to 7 per cent annually. It is currently building five new leather workshops in France due to come into use over the next five years.

“We produce with one thing in mind, quality, if we don’t manage to have this in terms of know-how or beauty of materials, I prefer not to produce,” even if this leads to bottlenecks, he said, adding that it takes 15 hours of labour to make a Birkin bag.

Larger rival LVMH has also said it does not intend to participate in the second-hand market and has emphasised efforts to offer repair services for its products instead.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990699887275696}",neutral,0.9990699887275696,0
The history behind French luxury fashion brand Louis Vuitton - Lifestyle Asia Kuala Lumpur,"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2tsL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vdGhlLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtZnJlbmNoLWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2tsL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vdGhlLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtZnJlbmNoLWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Often hailed as the world’s most valuable luxury brand, Louis Vuitton needs no introduction. Yet, its hallowed stature in the world of fashion and humongous business enterprise demands a retelling of the glorious history of Louis Vuitton. It is, after all, built on the dreams and aspirations of a teenager some 200 years ago — one that has and will continue to inspire countless generations.

Louis Vuitton, the brand, is today a division of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, simply known as LVMH or Louis Vuitton — a holding company which came into being in 1987 with the merger of the fashion house with Moët Hennessy.

One can get an idea about how massive LVMH is today through some of the luxury fashion brands it controls — Bulgari, Celine, Fendi, Givenchy, TAG Heuer, and Tiffany & Co. among others. Each brand has a storied history of its own and its own distinct image. And all of them are technically managed by LVMH, which functions within this umbrella as a distinct identity drawing from its history from about two centuries ago.

As of 2020, the Louis Vuitton company had 23,000 employees, 460 boutiques and over USD 10 billion in annual sales. Most famous for its bags, the house is also renowned for its ready-to-wear clothes, jewellery, watches and other luxury lifestyle accessories.

Here’s all you need to know about the French luxury brand Louis Vuitton

How it all started

The story of Louis Vuitton began with the dream of its namesake founder. Founder Louis Vuitton was only 16 years old in 1837 when he began his apprenticeship with trunk maker Monsieur Maréchal in Paris, France. His arrival in the city is something immensely inspiring; Vuitton, who was born in Anchay, walked 450 km from his birthplace to the European megacity to fulfil his dream of becoming a malletier, or trunk maker.

Vuitton’s talent helped him get noticed at the Parisian atelier during a time when clients had their trunks custom-made. After sharpening his skills for 17 years at Monsieur Maréchal’s atelier, Vuitton opened his own workshop at 4 Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, near the Place Vendome, in Paris in 1854.

This was an opportune moment for Vuitton as only a year ago, he had been appointed by Eugénie de Montijo, Empress of the French, as her official trunk maker and packer.

In 1859, Vuitton moved his trade to the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine in the city. The workshop at Asnières-sur-Seine is today a prime symbol of Louis Vuitton’s heritage and is at the centre of everything the fashion house has ever created.

At the time of its opening, the label had just 20 employees. By 1914, 225 workers were employed at the Louis Vuitton building in Asnières-sur-Seine. Around 170 craftspeople still work at the atelier, which functioned as the only workshop of the brand until 1977.

Today, the site is like a pilgrimage for the brand’s patrons. Besides being an active workshop, where the design and production of Louis Vuitton products for global markets continue, the Asnières-sur-Seine grounds have an Art Nouveau–style private museum as well, which once served as the Vuitton family residence.

The Asnières-sur-Seine atelier is extremely significant in the history of the Louis Vuitton brand. This is where the brand’s flat-top grey trunk, also known as the Trianon trunk, was produced.

The first custom Louis Vuitton trunk was designed for banker Albert Kahn. However, one of the greatest products ever produced by Louis Vuitton was perhaps a customised bed trunk for French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza in 1874. The bed trunk was basically a customised trunk that would convert into a bed — an ideal accessory for someone like Brazza. The illustrious explorer would remain a loyal customer of the brand till his death in 1905.

Revolutionising Louis Vuitton locks

The bed trunk was revolutionary, as its flat top made it more transportable and stackable than rounded top trunks. As it was also a period when people travelled primarily in horse-drawn carriages, ships or steam locomotives, flat tops ensured that the bags could be stacked easily, resulting in better handling of baggage.

Although the trunk became instantly famous, there was still a major problem haunting founder Louis Vuitton — theft. In those days, belongings were often stolen from trunks by ingenious thieves.

Thus, Georges Vuitton, Louis Vuitton’s only son, worked with his father to design a lock mechanism in 1886 which completely revolutionised baggage safety. The system, which came with two spring buckles, was renowned for being pick-proof. Later patented by Georges, the lock has been so effective that Louis Vuitton bags continue to feature it to date.

Georges took over the reins of the brand, which was still known as a luxury luggage maker, after Louis Vuitton passed away at the age of 70 in 1892. A year later, he presented the brand for the first time outside of France at the Chicago World Fair.

In fact, Georges’ ingenuity was key to the expansion of his father’s eponymous brand into a globe-trotting giant in the world of luxury living.

The iconic Louis Vuitton monogram

One of the most famous things that Georges did during his time as the head of the luxury fashion house was to give it an enduring symbol — the world-renowned Louis Vuitton Monogram.

The brand had been struggling with counterfeits of its products even when its founder was alive. He started using Damier print canvas and hand-painted striped patterns on future Louis Vuitton trunks in 1876 to distinguish Louis Vuitton authentic products from cheap copies. The Damier print canvas was especially noteworthy, for it was marked “marque L. Vuitton déposée” on the inside.

In 1896, Georges designed the brand’s beige-on-brown signature monogram canvas, showcasing graphic flowers and quatrefoil with his father’s initials “LV.” The classic monogram has featured prominently on nearly every product that the luxury label has since produced. Though its design underwent minor modifications, the monogram has remained the defining symbol of the brand, making its creations easily distinguishable in the world of luxury lifestyle.

Louis Vuitton celebrated the 100th anniversary of the monogram in 1996 by inviting six fashion designers — Vivienne Westwood, Romeo Gigli, Sybilla, Manolo Blahnik, Isaac Mazrahi and Helmut Lang — to create unique Louis Vuitton luggage pieces while incorporating the iconic print. The collection, which included a vinyl record box, a backpack with a built-in umbrella and an oval-shaped shoe trunk, was then exhibited across the world.

A historic request and a controversy

By the first quarter of the 20th century, the brand caught the eye of French fashion designer and businesswoman Coco Chanel. And in 1925, she requested the brand to produce the iconic domed handbag, which was then dubbed Squire. Thirty years later, the same Louis Vuitton bag would be renamed Alma.

The success of the collaboration led to the creation of the Louis Vuitton Speedy and the Keepall among other compact bags in the 1930s.

Gaston Louis Vuitton, Georges’ eldest son, took up the brand’s reins following the death of his father in 1936. As Europe plunged into World War II, Gaston steered the brand through the turmoil while ensuring that it remained relevant and innovation continued unhindered.

However, this period may have stained the brand. The Guardian in 2004 reported that a book titled Louis Vuitton, A French Saga by French author Stephanie Bonvicini alleged that members of the Vuitton family supported the Vichy regime under Marshal Philippe Pétain and made money from business deals with the Germans during World War II.

Bonvicini told the media house that when she asked for details of the brand’s wartime activities, the company told her that documents from the years 1930 to 1945 had been destroyed in a fire.

By the time of the revelation, Louis Vuitton was already under the ownership of LVMH. According to The Guardian, an LVMH spokesperson told the French satirical magazine Le Canard Enchainé, “We don’t deny the facts, but regrettably the author has exaggerated the Vichy episode.”

Following the revelation, an LVMH spokesperson told The Guardian, “This is ancient history. The book covers a period when it was family run and long before it became part of LVMH. We are diverse, tolerant and all the things a modern company should be.”

Celebrities carrying LV bags and the LVMH merger

Besides the controversy, Gaston’s time as the head of the family legacy was instrumental in building upon the foundations and pillars laid by his father and grandfather.

He introduced leather into Louis Vuitton creations and in 1966, unveiled the cylindrical Papillon bag, which continues to be one of the most famous products by the Louis Vuitton label.

During the 1960s, with its growing renown, Louis Vuitton bags were being spotted on celebrities, including French singer and actress Juliette Greco and French actress Catherine Deneuve, as well as the latter’s fashion photographer husband David Bailey.

Italian actress Anna Magnani was famously photographed during her vacation in Paris in 1960 with a stack of Louis Vuitton bags.

Following Gaston’s death, Henry Racamier, who had married Odile Vuitton, became the successor in 1977.

Despite its popularity among the French elite, there were only two Louis Vuitton stores in France and sales volume was less than USD 10 million. Racamier, who was a self-made steel tycoon, is credited with firmly placing Louis Vuitton on the world stage.

Under him, the luxury fashion house started expanding with more stores in major cities outside France. Within 10 years of Racamier assuming charge, the Maison opened over 100 stores globally.

In 1984, the business ceased to be family-owned and went public before merging with the luxury champagne brand Moët et Chandon and cognac brand Hennessy three years later to form, what is today, LVMH.

Racamier was in charge of LVMH until a legal tussle led to his ouster and Bernard Arnault taking control in 1990.

Interestingly, while Louis Vuitton was a phenomenon in luxury bags, its gargantuan rise in the world of fashion did not exactly begin until the 1990s.

As a brand, Louis Vuitton embarked on its new exploration of the luxury fashion world and the contemporary dressing of an elite clientele, primarily after becoming part of LVMH.

The seed of this new orientation towards fashion was planted after Yves Carcelle became the brand’s president in 1990 — the same year when the Vuitton family’s managerial control over the brand effectively ended.

Seven years later, Louis Vuitton would get on board a young New York-based fashion designer who would not only elevate the brand as a label but also transform the world of fashion; he was Marc Jacobs.

The rise of Louis Vuitton under Marc Jacobs

Jacobs, an American, arrived at Louis Vuitton as its creative director in 1997 and the following year, he launched the brand’s first-ever ready-to-wear line.

Thus began the brand’s storied rise as a fashion behemoth, which today stands as tall as its equally illustrious competitors outside of the LVMH umbrella such as Gucci, Balenciaga, Calvin Klein, CHANEL and Burberry.

Jacobs was a master conductor of the runway. His innovative designs had a magnetic pull on fashion enthusiasts, and supermodels, such as Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, walked the runway wearing the creations.

During his 16 years at Louis Vuitton, Jacobs gave a new identity to the classic monogram canvas by using them liberally on everything — from hats to fans and tights to jackets — as a print pattern. Many of the creations were available for sale in Louis Vuitton stores, helping the brand reach out to an even wider set of high-net-worth patrons who wanted to be seen in Louis Vuitton fashion.

The immensely creative mind of the maverick fashion designer was also instrumental in the brand’s collaborations with some of the finest contemporary artists of the world. This redefined Louis Vuitton’s iconic bags and was marked for the artists’ personal styles.

One of the most noteworthy collaborations was with Stephen Sprouse in 2001, three years before the American artist’s death from cancer. The product — Graffiti Speedy — is to date considered a landmark among Louis Vuitton bags.

As the name suggests, Sprouse overlaid the Speedy bag with the words “LV”, “Speedy” and “Louis Vuitton” appearing as spray-painted graffiti rendered in myriad colours. This unique styling was a far cry from the more sophisticated appearance of the usual LV monogram.

It was a megahit among all Louis Vuitton fans, so much so that Sprouse’s graffiti style was reused by Jacobs multiple times. One of them was a special tribute to the artist in 2009 in which Jacobs used a rose drawn by Sprouse on Louis Vuitton bags.

Another famous collaboration of Jacobs was with Takashi Murakami. The legendary Japanese contemporary artist gave his own spin to the LV monogram, releasing bags bearing the iconic brand symbol in playful colours, including hot pink, turquoise and Kelly green.

Dubbed the Monogram Multicolore collection, its design has been a major hit with younger fans of Louis Vuitton ever since.

Murakami and Louis Vuitton continued their collaboration over the decade with collections, including Cherry Blossom (2003), Monogramouflage (2008) and Cosmic Blossom (2010), featuring everything — from cherry blossom designs to Murakami’s signature kawaii illustrations.

Jacobs remained at the helm of the creatives at Louis Vuitton till 2014. He left his position to completely focus on his eponymous label, which he had founded years before joining the French luxury brand.

Fashion legends Nicolas Ghesquière and Virgil Abloh bring in new perspectives

French fashion designer Nicolas Ghesquière was appointed artistic director of women’s collections in November 2013, a month after it was revealed in the press that Jacobs is planning to leave the brand.

Ghesquière, who was formerly the creative director of another world-famous luxury fashion label, Balenciaga, immediately got down to business and released the Petite Malle bag at the Fall 2014 fashion show. The Petite Malle, whose name means “small trunk,” is universally hailed as one of the best Louis Vuitton products.

For the Petite Malle, Ghesquière drew inspiration from the earliest days of Louis Vuitton and recreated the brand’s original trunk shape and design as a miniature handbag. As such, its design incorporates the iconic LV S-lock, calfskin leather and golden brass detailing that were signature aspects of the early trunks.

For his first, highly anticipated collection for Louis Vuitton, Ghesquière borrowed the style ideas from the 1960s through the early ’80s to create racer-leather pants, abbreviated A-line skirts, zip-up high-necked sweaters and boxy jackets. The use of leather and the designer’s geometric perfection across the creations instantly appealed to everyone.

While Ghesquière continued getting the brand the attention it deserved in the women’s line, the men’s line was being handled by Kim Jones.

As the men’s artistic director since 2011, Jones was instrumental in bringing streetwear style to the house and made headlines for the brand’s collaboration with American clothing company Supreme.

Jones, however, left Louis Vuitton for Dior Homme. In 2018, his vacant position was filled by one of the greatest names in the world of fashion — Virgil Abloh.

The French luxury brand appointed Abloh as its men’s artistic director, which made him the first person of colour to hold the position in Louis Vuitton.

Abloh, who founded the fashion label Off-White, debuted 56 styles for Louis Vuitton as part of his first collection, known as Colour Theory, at the Paris Fashion Week in June 2018. Models walked down the ramp wearing unique apparel. These included anoraks with cuts at the back to fit in bum bags, leather vests with the LV monogram, and double-breasted wool-mohair blazers. The models sported accessories such as the Petite Malle and Keepall, reimagined in multiple colours, matte leather and hardware detailing.

The year 2021 was especially significant for both Abloh and Louis Vuitton with BTS, the globally renowned Korean pop boy band, becoming the new ambassadors of Louis Vuitton in April. The boy group joined the likes of Emma Stone, Sophie Turner and Naomi Osaka as the face of the brand.

In July, the group made its runway debut with a special fashion film at Louis Vuitton’s Fall/Winter 2021 menswear show in Seoul wearing Abloh’s creations.

All seven members — Jungkook, J-Hope, V, RM, Jin, Suga and Jimin — were dressed differently and their looks were uniquely accessorised. These included monogrammed sunglasses, white and green LV trainers, Louis Vuitton coffee cups and long coats with airplane motifs.

Outside of fashion, LVMH and Abloh reached an agreement under which the conglomerate took a majority stake in Off-White.

Abloh’s association with Louis Vuitton was, however, cut short by his untimely demise in November 2021. He had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2019. Louis Vuitton released his final collection in April 2022, for which Abloh partnered with Milan-based tattoo artist Ghusto Leon.

Louis Vuitton sees a future in the metaverse

The French fashion house is one of the earliest brands which took a deep interest in the future of fashion in the metaverse — a concept that is loosely understood as a platform where people can interact with each other and their environment virtually.

As part of it, the brand launched an adventure-based game, known as Louis the Game, in August 2021 to commemorate the 200th birth anniversary year of founder Louis Vuitton.

Playing as Louis Vuitton’s mascot, Vivienne, gamers need to collect 200 candles by dressing their avatars in the digital versions of Louis Vuitton fashion wear. The primary attraction of the game is non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — digital assets that are integral to the metaverse. Acclaimed digital artist Beeple created 30 NFTs for Louis the Game.

By April 2022, the game had been downloaded over two million times. New NFTs have been added, and players get a chance to collect more through special events like the NFT raffle, the last of which ended on 4 August 2022.

The Ambition of Loewe's Jonathan Anderson - The Cut,"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9qb25hdGhhbi1hbmRlcnNvbi1sb2V3ZS1wcm9maWxlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Romain Laprade

Loewe is a $1 billion-a-year fashion brand owned by LVMH, though it has been around since the mid-19th century, when a German immigrant in Madrid bought into a group of leather artisans and gave it his surname. You say Lo-WEH-vay. For close to a decade now, it has been under the creative direction of Jonathan Anderson. LVMH is extremely good at sprucing up storied houses, but until Anderson, it struggled to make the Spanish brand feel new and exciting instead of traditional and dull. The challenge defeated three designers over 16 years, each valiantly trying to come up with a fresh way to cut a pencil skirt or blazer in leather and suede. One critic summed up the excitement their clothes produced as “Madrid Whenever.”

It is telling that the first person who thought of Anderson for Loewe was Anderson. That’s how Pierre-Yves Roussel remembers the meeting in 2013. Roussel, who is now chief executive of Tory Burch, and Burch’s husband, was then head of the Fashion Group at LVMH. That year, at his urging, LVMH had taken a minority stake in the designer’s London brand, JW Anderson, which he started in 2008, just shy of turning 24. Anderson was known for casually non-binary designs, such as strapless tunics and ruffled shorts for men, and attention-getting references. He once created a collection of dark felted-wool trousers and Aran sweaters, roped with massive leather necklaces that looked like spinal cords, based on the idea of Rasputin on a ski holiday.

But Anderson’s personality was what caused the most intrigue in London’s clubby fashion circles. Tall and blond with a tendency to get possessed by things, he was like a big Labrador puppy, yet he had an analytic intelligence and an almost predatory sense of survival. One of his early employers, Sam Roddick, who ran a high-end sex shop where Anderson clerked while in design school, remembers him as someone who was “mapping out his ambition.” “He was quite a hunter of opportunities,” Roddick said. “He just knew when things were giving him an opportunity and when they weren’t.”

Roussel had a similar impression when he first met Anderson, shortly after the designer had launched his brand. “His work was interesting, but even more interesting was Jonathan,” Roussel recalled. “He was not just talking about the clothes, which is how most designers talk, but he was discussing story, brand space. He had references outside the pure fashion world — to architecture, art, and crafts.” The two became friends and would often chat about other brands. One day, Roussel mentioned he was looking for a new designer for Loewe — which, in terms of a league chart, was near the bottom of LVMH’s fashion brands. Did Anderson know of anyone?

“And he looked at me and said, ‘I would love to do it,’ ”

Roussel said. “He made that connection. I didn’t.” Within days, Anderson had prepared a presentation. “He had an interesting perspective on Spain, which has always been a challenge,” Roussel said. “If you’re too Spain — the paella and horses, etc. — then it’s boring. Instead, Jonathan had this whole Ibiza-in-the-’70s vibe.”

In his shows, Anderson still used leather, but the Ibiza angle allowed him to add cotton and other natural fabrics, which he did for the long, flowing dresses and voluminous pants that became Loewe signatures. He also got away from Loewe’s structured bag design, which used outmoded techniques like piping, and introduced softer, quirkier shapes, such as the Puzzle bag, with its geometric patchwork, and the Woven Basket, distinctive for its wide strips of calfskin. Anderson worked closely with a French stylist named Benjamin Bruno and considered him a partner. Bruno, who helped put together the presentation for Roussel, told me, “When LVMH offered Jonathan the job, Loewe was kind of a dormant vessel. We had to invent a fashion language for it.” They felt Loewe should be “a cultural brand” — aimed at people who were themselves collectors and connoisseurs of art and vernacular crafts and weren’t interested in logos. Hence the appearance in a 2020 show of full sleeves and flounces that might have strayed from a Goya painting and dresses adorned with large flat ceramic blobs (the work of a Japanese artisan) that evoked wombs. Critics praised Anderson’s “brain-revving” mixes while citing his reverence for humble objects like willow baskets. As Nancy Hass wrote in the New York Times in 2019, his concepts “speak to our moment, to our inchoate and inarticulable yearning for the earthbound, the slow, the imperfect and the anthropological.” For LVMH, there has been a payoff as well: Since Anderson took over, Loewe’s annual revenues have increased fivefold.

But by the spring of 2021, Anderson was tired of that language and the very things people had praised him for. He and Bruno both felt Loewe had become overcomplicated and nostalgic, and he now wanted something incisive and strong — so strong, he hoped, that it would cause LVMH executives sitting in the front row to go, What are you doing? As Bruno put it, “We knew that we had to make a shift before the tide changed. We couldn’t have gone back to an overflowing, lineny parade full of trinkets. The change had to be brutal.” In all likelihood, Anderson was analyzing his place on the fashion map relative to his peers. Demna was blowing up Balenciaga; Prada had renewed itself thanks to the combo of Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons. As Anderson told me during one of several conversations this summer, he felt after the lockdowns that “if we are going to show again, I want to make sure I have a job for the next ten years. And the only way for that to happen is to be in the top-five shows that people are engaging with.” He had no idea if his plan would work — and he wouldn’t know, he told himself, until the morning of October 1, when the spring 2022 show was under way in Paris.

The main point of difference in the October 2021 show, and again in the March show — the two must be linked because Anderson didn’t back off his attack — is the focus on the body. The clothes revealed legs, shoulders, the outline of breasts and waists. In March, the models wore fit-and-flare minidresses made of leather that had been soaked in water and then molded to look as fluid as silk. That much female sexuality has never been present in Anderson’s designs. He usually covers up the body. In the past, his collections tended to feature a pastiche of obscure artistic or cultural references, but both of these shows tackled a more sophisticated subject: Surrealism, the art movement that links fashion greats, from Elsa Schiaparelli and Yves Saint Laurent through Martin Margiela and John Galliano. Anderson approached it aggressively and wittily with the tops of viscose-satin columns shaped into glossy lips, shoes with heels that looked like balloons ready to burst, and jersey dresses embedded with curvy breastplates. Sarah Mower, writing in Vogue, called the October show a “massive creative change.”

It seems ironic that after years of pinning his confidence on the outside of fashion — on the hundreds of things that obsess him — Anderson at long last found it on the inside, in the primal elements of line and sexuality. As I went round the shows that season, the one collection every designer wanted to talk about was Loewe’s.

“We worked so hard on that collection,” Anderson told me. Still, not until the show had begun, and he looked at the audience through his backstage video monitor and saw their rapt and slightly confused expressions, did he know he had succeeded. He said, “I think people were so used to what we had done before that this was a kind of knife edge. I remember saying to Ben that night, ‘Now we can head in a different direction.’ ”

Anderson lives in a modest, late-Victorian terrace house in East London that he bought soon after joining Loewe. In the living room, there are pieces from his large ceramics collection, mainly Japanese and English in origin, along with spare antique tables and a beige sofa by the Belgian designer Axel Vervoordt. Later this year, Anderson will begin construction on a new house on Highbury Fields, a park surrounded by Georgian homes. The property is actually a former stable yard; in the ’70s, someone bought three stables and built “a monstrosity,” as Anderson put it. Since the building is unlisted, he’ll be able to tear it down. “The garden is dictating the design of the house. The idea is you’ll enter the garden first and then the house,” he told me as we drank coffee in his kitchen in June. To help accomplish this vision, he hired the well-known English landscaper Dan Pearson. “It’s a crazy process, but you need a distraction when you’re working all the time,” Anderson said. Wearing jeans and sneakers, he had returned at one in the morning from Ibiza following a Loewe party.

Anderson is ambitious and, at 37, still young. Even so, it’s rare for designers to make a major turn in their work without switching jobs. Having written about his collections for years, I wanted to know what aspects of his background and character might help explain such a remarkable change. Because on the surface, very little is obvious.

Anderson comes from a middle-class family in Northern Ireland. His father, Willie, was captain of the Irish Rugby team and was a colorful figure who, long before Jonathan was born in the town of Magherafelt, spent a brief time in an Argentine jail for a prank he played during a World Cup match. (He climbed a flagpole and removed the national flag.) His mother, Heather, was an English teacher. It was the time of the Troubles, and Anderson, raised Protestant, recalls passing through checkpoints to go to school. He said he attended school one day even though an IRA car bomb had exploded in the town center. “It does make you quite hard because emotionally you were toughened by that,” he said.

With Jonathan, everything is a bit of a battle, whether it is or not.

From his parents, he said, there was “never any kind of judgment or expectation” about a career path. When Jonathan was 18, they sent him to live with friends in Washington, D.C., so he could study acting; he had already done some youth theater at home. “It was very bizarre,” he admitted of the choice of Washington over better options in Dublin or London. In any event, Anderson had the time of his life thanks in part to a weak dollar. “It was also the moment that I came out,” he recalled. “Near Dupont Circle, there was a Starbucks, a DVD store, and a bookstore, and I think I flirted with every single clerk and everything was free.”

Anderson also developed an obsession with James Dean, the movie star killed in a car crash in 1955. It was a formative step in his understanding of the power of aesthetics and trying on various guises. He said, “I think I read every single book on him. The sexual ambiguity, the look — to the point where I dressed like that. I think I took up smoking because of him. He was quite sadistic and twisted in a way. I think people would have said he was an asshole because he used a lot of people to get what he wanted.” Anderson cocked his head. “Well, if James Dean was doing that, then it’s fine.” He laughed.

After two years of shenanigans during which he realized he didn’t actually like acting, his parents told him to come home and get a job while he prepared to enter a university. That job — as a salesman in the men’s area of the department store Brown Thomas in Dublin, where his father had an apartment — gave him his first insight into the difference between high fashion and mere clothing. Hedi Slimane was in his prime at Dior with the skinny suit. “And none of it ever sold. It was so skinny,” Anderson said. “That’s all I ever wore because it was on the discount rack.” But it was a look, a grade up from the tragic-outlaw cliché. He remembered wearing a Dior tuxedo jacket “with all this fringe coming off it” and a pair of massive trousers and “I’m in it in the only gay nightclub in Dublin.”

He decided to become a designer, persuaded by the acceptance he felt in his outfits. The portfolio he sent for admission to English schools like Central Saint Martins consisted of a photo of himself at drama school, examples of his visual merchandising at Brown Thomas, and a few ideas about clothes. (“That’s how bad it was.”) Every school turned him down except the London College of Fashion, which offered him a place in a new pilot course for menswear. This was less than it might appear. In the early aughts, creative menswear was still an outlier. The attention was all on women’s fashion, and menswear didn’t even have a slot on the British Fashion Council show schedule. “I don’t think I learned anything there,” he said of his three years at LCF. “I think I learned how to make a shirt.”

The arrogance of that statement is striking. Anderson saw himself in the early years of his career as an outsider, “an underdog” — in part, he said, because he is Irish and because he didn’t qualify for a top art school: “I think there was a bit of a chip on my shoulder. Everyone who was successful in fashion had gone to Central Saint Martins, and to me that was incredibly annoying.” Its best-known alumni were Galliano and Alexander McQueen, and their heirs in provocative design — including Christopher Kane, Gareth Pugh, and Jonathan Saunders — were also Saint Martins graduates and were hitting the scene around the same time as Anderson. He said he probably hadn’t helped himself with his attitude, but “when you’re not part of something, you have to retaliate. You become more arrogant because you’re trying to exist in a system that is not really for you.” Some of his feelings and frustrations were probably legitimate, but one shouldn’t take Anderson fully at his word on this score. As Adam Iezzi, a close friend and his publicist since 2009, told me, “With Jonathan, everything is a bit of a battle, whether it is or not.” It’s also true that some editors and fellow designers found him “quite tricky,” to use Anderson’s own term. “People were unsure about him,” Yasmin Sewell, who was a creative consultant for the department store Liberty, told me. “He wasn’t part of that London crowd of designers who were all good friends. He wasn’t liked by that crowd. And you know what? He just didn’t care. His focus was somewhere else.”

Anderson was never a designer in the proper sense, like McQueen, who could cut and drape. He related more to another fashion genius who didn’t have formal skills: Miuccia Prada, who studied political science and mime before she started making clothes. Prada didn’t sketch or know how to make a dress pattern. Instead, she talked out her ideas — her feelings about women, politics, sexuality, bourgeois culture — with her director of design, resulting in an idiosyncratic aesthetic that in the late ’90s set a new standard for young designers. Before Prada, the best designers were masters of a singular form (Giorgio Armani, say) or, like Margiela, avant-garde speculators mining the history of couture for modern meaning; after Prada, they aspired to be creative directors who work largely by taking an idea or object — an image on the internet, a vintage garment — hashing it over with a trusted collaborator, and afterward placing that raw concept in the hands of a design team to further develop. That, in essence, is how Anderson and Bruno work today. But in the early years, before this method of designing was the norm, there was reason to be skeptical of Anderson. Talking to him, you were aware that he had once been an actor, someone with a gift for the left-field source (he has cited Seamus Heaney and once used the photography of William Gedney) and the well-polished line. It would have taken a leap of faith to see his potential as a major designer. Sewell, remembering her first encounter with him in 2009 in his East London studio, said, echoing Roussel, “He wasn’t making clothes that I thought were interesting. It was a little messy. But I could see what he was doing with accessories. And it was really his brain that blew me away. He had something in his head that you couldn’t see in the clothes, yet.”

His earliest creations were jewelry. These included brooches of taxidermy mice adorned with feathers and Swarovski crystals that he named after designers, such as Vivienne Westwood, and sold to a London shop called twosee. “They were pretty grotesque but also glamorous,” Anthony Stephinson, the store’s manager and buyer, recalled. Stephinson, now an artist in Paris, believes the brooches were characteristic of Anderson’s approach — his sense of provocation and his ability to look ahead, making accessories before he made the rest. Stephinson pointed out that, from the start, Anderson was also business minded: “I mean, he had a logo before he made anything. That JW anchor logo has been around since before he actually made clothing.”

By 2013, Anderson had achieved limited success with JW and the brand now included women’s clothes. He had to continually balance the running of the business, which had faced cash crises — at one point, his parents had to bail him out — with the need for ambitious work. In January of that year, he put on a men’s show that featured ruffled shorts and bustiers with frill-topped riding boots and models groomed with the suavity of ’30s film stars. Iezzi, remembering the reaction from editors, said, “I had people coming up to me from commercial titles saying, ‘Why did you make me go to that show?’ The collection didn’t sell. It was featured in the Daily Mail as a joke. And Jonathan said to me, ‘I’m just going to do, like, an A.P.C. collection. Something really commercial.’ And of course, the next season, he did men in black wigs with headscarves.” Today, that collection with the ruffles is regarded as a bellwether of nonbinary fashion. It also contained the incisiveness in shape and materials that would show up almost a decade later.

A few months after the show, LVMH decided to invest in JW Anderson — the only up-and-coming brand, according to Roussel, that had received such a commitment. Then Anderson confidently raised his hand for Loewe.

A week after I visited Anderson at his home, I met him at Loewe’s new headquarters on Rue Scribe, not far from the Madeleine. (The brand’s workshops are still in Spain.) The building and the surrounding area were once at the heart of 19th-century Paris culture. Worth’s original maison de couture is two blocks away, and Nadar’s studio, where Baudelaire and George Sand sat for their portraits, is down the street. On that June day, Anderson and Bruno were huddling in the studio with Ashley Brokaw, a top casting agent, to pick models for the spring 2023 men’s show to happen in a few days. Anderson described his concept as “nature meets technology.” On a clothes stand nearby was a dark wool coat trimmed with a grid of small iPads blinking with the same blurry image. “I like the idea that we use them as they are,” he told me. “They just become Tetris blocks.” Loewe doesn’t plan to produce the coats. “Well, we could,” Anderson said. “Sometimes fashion is not about selling; it’s about introducing ideas.”

A decade after he raised eyebrows with his naïf ruffles and wanky, attention-getting references, Anderson is now an exemplar of the modern creative director. He’s competitive, he has an uncanny instinct for the next thing, but, more than that, he has a predatory sense of his own survival in the industry. “He can see the whole field and where to go and who’s got the ball,” said his friend Amanda Harlech, who was an adviser to Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano.

After the March show — the one featuring molded-leather minis and lip dresses — the first person backstage to congratulate Anderson (who had actually stepped out to have a cigarette) was Sidney Toledano, the former head of Dior, who is now chief executive of LVMH’s fashion division. He told me, “Today everybody in the group is convinced we can do the brand in a big way.” He added, “I’ve worked with John, with Hedi, with Karl, but you see the real potential with this guy. He could do couture. He has an eye, and he’s smart. Even if you are a genius today, in this business you are not a painter. You are not Monsieur Rodin. You need the atelier, the right materials, and the right people to execute.” Pascale Lepoivre, Loewe’s chief executive, notes that America, for example, is still open for expansion: “In the U.S., we have five stores — that’s it.” And jewelry is a still-untapped category, she said. Over the summer, there was also a rumor that Anderson was headed to Louis Vuitton, possibly to succeed the late Virgil Abloh as men’s creative director. Vuitton denied the rumor.

Anderson broke away from the model discussion to show me sketches of the upcoming women’s collection, which alluded vaguely to armor and the crash sculptures of John Chamberlain. But in mid-June, it was too early for him to elaborate. “We’re trying to do this thing, which hopefully the next time I see you will be resolved: an entirely 3-D printed heel,” he said, “which will then be cast in a mold and industrialized so the shape will be that of a Barbie shoe.”

We left the group and went to his wood-lined office. On the desk were a small basket — the work of a Korean artisan woven from tiny twisted strands of paper and that Loewe reproduced (and quickly sold out of) — and a set of oval Shaker boxes. “I find them so simple and modern,” he said of the boxes. “These are 1840. They’re just singular.” Anderson said he usually has about 20 objects in the room, including historical garments. The point is mostly just to look at them. “I’m sure Pascale thinks I’m mental when I buy certain things,” he said, smiling. He once, for example, bought a piece of 15th-century railing. As a creative, you don’t want your mind to get trapped: “If you live in the same environment all the time, you can reproduce it quite a lot.”

He went to a cupboard and fetched a bespoke purple dandy’s coat made in London in the time of Oscar Wilde. Touching the velvet, he said, “How radical this must have been.” Of course, many designers get ideas from exquisite objects of the past as well as from the mundane (think of Coco Chanel’s fisherman blouses and maid collars), but Anderson’s obsession with craft — going back to those Aran sweaters and even the mice — provided the wedge that separated Loewe from its luxury rivals.

Why is Richemont telling shareholders to vote against Francesco Trapani? - Style,"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxODkwOTQvd2hvLWNhcnRpZXItb3duZXItcmljaGVtb250cy1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLXdvdWxkLWJl0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL25ld3MtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMzE4OTA5NC93aG8tY2FydGllci1vd25lci1yaWNoZW1vbnRzLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnNpYWwtd291bGQtYmU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a ratcheting up of the battle between the luxury group and activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners Ltd., which proposed the appointment, Richemont said Trapani is an “inappropriate candidate” and his election is not in the interest of the company.

Richemont, the maker of Cartier jewellery, said shareholders should vote against the appointment of Francesco Trapani to the board because he is too closely associated with arch-rival LVMH.

Richemont chairman Johann Rupert controls the high-end group through its “B-class shares”. The South African billionaire holds 10 per cent of the company’s share capital and 51 per cent of its voting rights, according to the company’s most recent annual report. The “A” shares are publicly traded and have a bigger economic interest but lower voting rights than Rupert.

Bluebell, which has a history of taking on large European companies, wants a representative for the “A” shareholders and proposed ex-Bulgari chief executive officer Trapani, who led the jewellery brand for nearly three decades until 2011. Trapani was also a founding partner of Bluebell in 2019.

Richemont said on August 15 that Bluebell, which has a relatively small stake, lacks the “legitimacy” to represent the “A” shareholders.

The luxury group’s shares were little changed in early Swiss trading, and have fallen 17 per cent this year.

Bluebell’s likelihood of success in shaking up Richemont’s board has been met with scepticism by analysts because of Rupert’s firm grip on the Swiss company. Bluebell wasn’t immediately available to comment.

Why is Richemont objecting to Trapani?

Richemont objects to Trapani because he was the CEO of Bulgari when it was acquired by LVMH and served as chairman and CEO of the rival’s watches and jewellery division between 2011 and 2014. Trapani was also on LVMH’s board of directors for a period and acted as an adviser to the luxury group’s founder and CEO Bernard Arnault.

“LVMH is one of our company’s key competitors,” Richemont said in a letter to shareholders. “The board may not responsibly recommend to shareholders to let a person who has a long association with that group – as well as personal relationship with that group’s main shareholder – become a director of our company and intervene in our company’s decision-making process.”

Richemont already has the “best jewellery and luxury experts in-house, both on the board and in the executive management”, making any contribution by Trapani unnecessary, the company said.

Who’s the alternative candidate?

In 34 years of existence no investor had ever asked for a representative for those owning “A” shares, the company said, adding that all board directors act in the interest of all shareholders. In response to Bluebell’s motion, however, it has recommended current board member Wendy Luhabe be designated as the representative of the “A” shareholders.

As reported, the activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners wants to install its cofounder Trapani, formerly chief of Bulgari and of the watch and jewelry division at LVMH, as the representative of the “A” shareholders on the board of Richemont.

More from WWD

Bluebell’s proposal will be put to a vote at Richemont’s AGM in Geneva on Sept. 7.

In a detailed letter to shareholders, Rupert said that Bluebell has a relatively small stake in Richemont, parent of brands including Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Dunhill, and lacks the “legitimacy to represent all ‘A’ shareholders on the board.”

Rupert described Trapani as an “inappropriate candidate for election,” adding that he is “not independent, as he has a long history of close relationship with the LVMH group and its main shareholder.”

“LVMH is one of our company’s key competitors. The board may not responsibly recommend to shareholders to let a person who has a long history of association with that group – as well as a personal relationship with that group’s main shareholder – become a director of our company and intervene in our company’s decision-making process,” Rupert said.

Richemont’s chairman reminded shareholders that Trapani was CEO of Bulgari when it agreed to be acquired by LVMH in 2011, and later served as chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Watches and Jewelry division from 2011 through 2014.

Trapani also sat on LVMH’s board of directors from 2011 through 2016 and worked as an advisor to LVMH’s Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault from 2014 through 2016. Trapani resigned from Tiffany’s board in November 2019, the day after LVMH acquired the U.S. jewelry giant.

Story continues

Bluebell, which has been lobbying for change across a variety of industries and companies, including Hugo Boss, first tabled its request earlier this month. Trapani is a cofounder of Bluebell, although he no longer has shares, or operational involvement, in the company.

Richemont’s “A” shares are publicly traded, while the “B” shares are held by Rupert and his family. Rupert also has 51 percent of the voting rights and can veto board members’ appointments, even if those candidates are elected by shareholders.

As reported, Richemont is proposing that its shareholders elect Wendy Luhabe, a former Richemont employee and a current member of the board, instead of Trapani.

In Monday’s letter to shareholders, Rupert described Luhabe, who is based in South Africa, as an “ideal” candidate. He cited her extensive business and boardroom experience, as well as her contribution in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion.

Rupert also noted that, until this year, Richemont’s board did not propose to elect one specific director to represent the holders of its “A” shares. He said Richemont considers that directors “must act in the interest of all shareholders, and not only of one class of them. Swiss law, however, entitles Bluebell to request the appointment of such a representative.”

He said that given the diverse makeup of the “A” shareholders, “neither Bluebell nor Mr Trapani has legitimacy to represent them as a group. For this reason, the board considers that its current independent directors are the best suited to serve as representatives of the ‘A’ shareholders on the board.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999922513961792}",neutral,0.9999922513961792,0

Harlem’s Fashion Row has created a new award in honor of the life and legacy of the late Virgil Abloh. Officially named the Virgil Abloh Award presented by LVMH, the recognition is set to be introduced during this year’s highly-anticipated 15th Anniversary Fashion Show & Style Awards scheduled to open New York Fashion Week on Sept. 6.

According to a press release, the Virgil Abloh Award was created to celebrate like-minded individuals who embody Virgil’s spirit, brilliance, and vision, through invaluable contributions to culture, community, and innovation.

The 15th Anniversary Fashion Show & Style Awards will take place in partnership with LVMH through a standing relationship between the company and HFR to continue its commitment to work toward a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive fashion industry.

The theme of the special anniversary event is “Future’s Past.” Fashion designers Clarence Ruth of Cotte D’Armes, Johnathon Hayden of Deus Ex Machina, and Nicole Benefield who represents her self-titled brand will all present their latest collections.

“African Americans have a rich history in fashion, although much of their contributions have been buried or unrecognized in history. However, HFR would not exist without the work of Black designers like Lois Alexander Lane, who created the Harlem Institute of Fashion and the Black Fashion Museum. We also would not exist without the work of other sartorial pioneers like Ann Lowe, Elizabeth Keckley, and Eunice Johnson. We are moving into the future by reaching back to understand, honor, and pull strength from our past,” explained Brandice Daniel, CEO & Founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row.

French luxury menswear brand Berluti is expanding its digital footprint in China by launching on Alibaba Group’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

During the hard launch, Berluti will offer Tmall shoppers exclusive access to its global debut of Playoff sneakers.

“As a crucial step in the brand’s business expansion and digitalization process, we have high hopes for this strategic cooperation with Tmall,” said Laurent Barrere, Managing Director of Berluti, China & Asia Pacific.

Part of the LVMH Group, Berluti has been steadily expanding in China, which is on pace to be the world’s largest luxury market by 2025.

Tmall Luxury Pavilion is an online shopping destination for China’s swelling ranks of affluent consumers. It is the first luxury platform in China to offer consumers brands from the world’s five major luxury groups: LVMH, Kering, Chanel, Hermes and Richemont.

“Tmall Luxury Pavilion platform has a large number of high-net-worth consumers, as well as young people with a high degree of digitalization,” said Janet Wang, General Manager of Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

The cohort of consumers born between 1980 and 1995, also known as Millennials, make up over 67% of shoppers on Tmall Luxury Pavilion, while the more digitally-native Generation Z born between 1996 and 2010 takes up over 17%, according to a report by consultancy Roland Berger and Alibaba.

During its hard launch on Tmall Luxury Pavilion, Berluti said it would also work with Tmall’s Hey Box, where Chinese consumers discover new products on Tmall, Alibaba’s B2C e-commerce platform.

Customers on Hey Box will be able to buy selected styles of the Playoff sneakers on Tmall.

Inspired by high-top basketball sneakers of the 1980s and early 1990s and paying homage to Berluti’s first-ever sneaker Playtime, it has a sporty design. Tmall shoppers will have access to two low-top styles in nero grigio and honey shades.

Digital shoppers can create wardrobes from ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, accessories to lifestyle products available on Tmall’s store.

Berluti was established in Paris in 1895 and has been built by four generations of shoemakers. In 2005 fine leather goods were introduced and, in 2011, a complete clothing collection. Berluti has over 60 stores worldwide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7833344340324402}",neutral,0.7833344340324402,0

A look back at Bernard Arnault’s inspiring career.



Bernard Arnault was born on March 5, 1949 in Roubaix to a mother who inherited the Ferret-Savinel construction group and a father who was a company director. After studying at the École Polytechnique, he quickly took control of the family business, becoming director of construction and then managing director three years later.

He then tried to make a name for himself in the United States with the company, renamed Ferinel, operating in the real estate development industry. In 1984, Bernard Arnault and a group of investors took over the Boussac group, which included Christian Dior. The company quickly became the center of the businessman’s luxury strategy. In 1989, he became the main shareholder of LVMH and headed the world’s leading luxury group. In January of the same year, he was appointed chairman of the LVMH group and still holds this position today.

Since then, he has focused on growing his portfolio of prestigious brands with major acquisitions in new sectors such as wines and spirits, jewelry, hotels, cosmetics, perfumes, selective distribution and the press.

The businessman is also Chairman of the Board of Groupe Arnault S.E. Through his family holdings, Bernard Arnault manages the Group and participates in the creation of several international investment funds.

3rd largest fortune in the world

At $158 billion, Bernard Arnault’s personal fortune is impressive. According to the latest ranking of the world’s largest fortunes by Forbes magazine, Bernard Arnault is the third richest man in the world, after Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

Among his hobbies, we find a passion for music, especially the piano, but also for painting and modern art. A true collector, he even became a patron of the arts and supported contemporary artistic creation by inaugurating the Louis Vuitton Foundation, near Paris. He is also Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor and Commander of the Arts and Letters.

Tod's owners to take company private in €1.3B buyout - Axios,"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9wcm8vcmV0YWlsLWRlYWxzLzIwMjIvMDgvMDMvdG9kcy1vd25lcnMtdGFrZS1wcml2YXRlLTFiLWJ1eW91dNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The owners of luxury shoemaker Tod’s — the Italian billionaire Della Valle family — plan to take the company private in a deal valuing it at roughly €1.3 billion, according to the Financial Times. Why it matters: Luxury retail dealmaking is having its day in the sun, with Tom Ford, Gieves & Hawkes and Armani all in play. One more valuation comp certainly couldn't hurt.

Driving the news: The Della Valle family said taking Tod's private will enhance the company's value and augment its visibility — away from the prying eyes of the public market, which imposes listing requirements, such as earnings updates.

The family is offering shareholders €40 for their shares, the same price it listed at in 2000, the FT notes.

Tod’s will delist from the Borsa Italiana following 22 years on the Milan-based stock exchange.

State of play: Hit by the COVID pandemic, which derailed the company’s plan to modernize the brand, Tod's sold a 6.8% stake to LVMH for €75 million last year. LVMH already owned 3.2%.

The company had been struggling pre-pandemic— its share price reached a height in September 2013 (€138.60) but has fallen about 70% to €40.32 today.

In 2017, CEO Diego Della Valle announced a turnaround plan for the company.

The intrigue: Despite luxury retail increasingly trending toward streetwear, CEO Della Valle insisted back in 2019 that the brand would not turn into a millennial streetwear label, FT reports.

💭 Our thought bubble: Analysts speculate this could be the first step in an eventual sale of the company to LVMH. We're not so sure — LVMH isn't shy about executing on M&A and if it wanted to own Tod's outright, it would.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.980336606502533}",neutral,0.980336606502533,0
How Does a Brand Like Louis Vuitton Choose a New Designer? - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH has spent nearly a year searching for a successor for Virgil Abloh, who died in November 2021 at 41. Martine Rose, Grace Wales Bonner and Telfar Clemens are among the designers who have been considered by Vuitton-owner LVMH, according to sources. A decision is expected within weeks. (Representatives from Louis Vuitton and LVMH did not respond to a request for comment.)

Given the circumstances, it’s not surprising the leather goods giant has taken time to announce a new men’s artistic director. Abloh’s work for Louis Vuitton had cultural resonance that transcended fashion, attracting a younger, more diverse consumer and resulting in significant sales momentum.

While Abloh’s tenure was ultimately one chapter in the story of the 168-year-old Louis Vuitton, any successor will face the delicate task of moving the brand forward while respecting his legacy.

How does a company like LVMH go about finding that person?

ADVERTISEMENT

Evolution or Revolution

First off, a label’s stewards — the board of directors, a CEO, a founder — must be clear about whether they aim to overhaul its image, as with the appointment of Demna at Balenciaga, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe or Phoebe Philo at Céline, or “evolve” it, as Saint Laurent CEO Francesca Bellettini did when she hired Anthony Vaccarello to replace Hedi Slimane in 2016.

When a brand is doing well and the creative director exits — as was the case of Saint Laurent, or Louis Vuitton men’s — putting together a list of viable candidates may be harder than when a company is in need of a significant refresh.

“There is less risk with brands that are not in good shape,” said Anne Raphaël, a managing partner at executive recruitment firm Boyden. “It’s easier to take a bet.”

An overhaul typically requires a brand to seek candidates from outside the company, while an evolution often means mining the internal team, such as when Sarah Burton succeeded Alexander McQueen, Matthieu Blazy replaced Daniel Lee at Bottega Veneta or Virginie Viard took over at Chanel. Of course, a revolution can also come from within (see: Alessandro Michele’s Gucci) just as an evolution can come from drafting in someone from outside the company (see: Vaccarello’s Saint Laurent).

Critical Attributes

The most important thing is that candidates are able to establish a clear point of view. If they have their own label, they also need to convince recruiters that they have the skills to simultaneously turn out two separate, differentiated visions, even if they are linked by an underlying approach.

Candidates must also demonstrate ability to operate in a corporate environment, something many young designers have never done. Some adapt easily to a more structured working process. Others struggle. This is especially important when a designer needs to build new teams from scratch, which can be challenging for inexperienced talents.

Being able to connect with the CEO is also critical. “They should be able to challenge each other,” Raphaël said. “It has to be a collaboration.”

Product or Storytelling

Bigger brands with strong studio teams are often less interested in skilled design technicians than those who excel at brand vision and communication.

“Product of course is important, but putting that aside, what I am really looking for is somebody that can develop a brand vision into a lifestyle that penetrates the mood and also predicts the future of popular culture,” said Lewis Alexander, an independent recruiter who has worked with labels including Bottega Veneta, Celine and Louis Vuitton.

“It’s not only about offering a collection, they have to be able to tell a story,” added Raphaël.

At Louis Vuitton, it was Abloh’s skill as an industrial product designer — combined with his ability to communicate ideas — that made his work so potent. On the other hand, Alaïa, which appointed Pieter Mulier to succeed its namesake founder, needed a technical maestro. Mulier’s tenure under Raf Simons in the Dior couture atelier made him a compelling choice.

Company executives often ask candidates to complete a creative project that can range from product ideas to a brand book or something more abstract, like conceiving a room in the brand’s essence, depending on the nature of the search.

“They need to show that they get it,” said Caroline Pill, a partner in the fashion, luxury and beauty practise at London-based Heidrick & Struggles. “Sometimes it’s going back to the archives, sometimes it’s imagining a new world.”

Increasingly, a candidate’s personal brand is also a factor. If they have their own following and can bring that following along for the ride that can be seen as a big plus. Abloh did this exceptionally well. Gabriela Hearst, too, has brought the eco-consciousness at the core of her personal brand to her work at Chloé with some success. (Her Nama sneaker, made from low-impact materials, is a best-seller.)

Sealing the Deal

While most design contracts are between three and five years, the best partnerships last longer. Incentives for designers include multi-year contracts that go into the seven or eight figures, as well as additional benefits, like luxurious housing paid for by the company, that make it difficult to leave.

On some occasions, deal sweeteners can include “shadow equity” or bonuses tied to business results. They can also include an investment in the designer’s namesake brand, as LVMH did with Off-White, Marc Jacobs and JW Anderson. This has benefits in both directions, however, effectively locking the designer in and keeping them from working for competitors. (Sometimes this can also deliver meaningful revenue, as the Marc Jacobs brand has for LVMH.)

However, sometimes a designer does not want investment, which can be a deal-breaker for the hiring company, as they want to control as much of the designer’s time as they can. Alternatively, the company may suggest a new designer put their label on pause if they don’t believe they will have the time or energy to do both jobs.

Other roadblocks to getting a deal signed: If a designer is working for a competitor, a brand may have to wait out a non-compete, or pay a hefty sum — and legal fees — in order to bring them over sooner. There’s also a chance that a designer has a better offer, or is simply not ready to commit to a creative director role.

The Final Decision

Ultimately, the final decision at a company like LVMH is made by the group’s CEO, who listens to recommendations from top advisors, the board of directors and the brand CEO. The selection is part art, part science.

“Gut feeling is in the valuation of how well the candidate is understanding the brand vision,” Raphaël said. “Everything else is extremely thoughtful.”

Cartier owner Richemont called for shareholders to snub the appointment of former LVMH executive Francesco Trapani to the board this morning, calling out his close connections to firm’s biggest rival.

Calling him an “inappropriate” candidate, Richemont chairman Johann Rupert said in a letter to shareholders: “He is not independent, as he has a long history of close relationship with the LVMH group and its main shareholder.”

Trapani, who was CEO of Bulgari when it agreed to be acquired by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton in 2011, has been the top candidate for activist investor Bluebell Capital Management.

Trapani also served as chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Watches and Jewellery Division from 2011 through 2014, on LVMH’s Board of Directors from 2011 through 2016 and as an advisor to LVMH’s Chairman and CEO from 2014 through 2016.

Mr Trapani resigned from Tiffany’s board in November 2019, the day after the merger agreement was executed with LVMH.

Instead, Rupert has put forward an internal candidate, the independent director Wendy Luhabe.

The firm is set to hold an AGM on 7 September.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999184608459473}",neutral,0.9999184608459473,0
Has the Swiss watch market rebounded since the Covid-19 slump? - Style,"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTkwNzQ5L2hhcy1zd2lzcy1sdXh1cnktd2F0Y2gtbWFya2V0LXJlYm91bmRlZC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1zbHVtcNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTkwNzQ5L2hhcy1zd2lzcy1sdXh1cnktd2F0Y2gtbWFya2V0LXJlYm91bmRlZC1jb3ZpZC0xOS1zbHVtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“For now people’s state of mind stays positive. How long will it last? We don’t know,” said Jean-Christophe Babin, head of LVMH jewellery and watch brand Bulgari.

Sales of Swiss watches have rebounded strongly from the 2020 pandemic slump, with the value of exports up 11.4 per cent in the first seven months of 2022.

Swiss watchmakers are not seeing signs so far that geopolitical tensions and recession fears are hitting demand for luxury timepieces, executives said ahead of the Geneva Watch Days event that opened on August 29.

He said Bulgari was gaining market share, seeing “much stronger” growth in its watch business than the rate of Swiss watch exports.

While there were many reasons to be alarmed over the last two years, including the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and inflation, “watch exports are nevertheless close to all-time highs”, Edouard Meylan, head of independent watch brand H. Moser & Cie, said.

“We need to take advantage while it lasts, but we have to get ready for a slowdown,” he said, adding sales were up by more than a quarter so far this year, with some bottlenecks for watch cases and straps.

Around 40 brands will take part in this year’s Geneva Watch Days, an informal industry gathering launched in 2020 where exhibits are held in hotels and boutiques around town, making it more accessible than spring’s exclusive Watches & Wonders show

Although not taking part in this year’s event, Guido Terreni, chief executive of niche brand Parmigiani owned by the Sandoz Family Foundation, said the brand was unable to meet demand that had risen 4.5 times from last year.

Asked when it would break even, Terreni, a former Bulgari executive, said: “We’re getting there.”

The market for new timepieces remained robust with waiting lists for many models , said US-based retailer Danny Govberg, also co-founder and chairman of watch marketplace WatchBox, echoing comments by British retailer Watches of Switzerland this month.

“The disparity between retail prices and what watches are actively trading for has come down from their early spring 2022 all-time highs, since stabilising,” he said in an emailed comment.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said if prices for second-hand watches fell significantly below primary prices, this could hurt demand for new watches, but that was apparently not the case so far.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9771275520324707}",positive,0.9771275520324707,1

ZURICH: Richemont on Monday urged shareholders to vote against appointing a representative of activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners to the luxury goods firm's board, citing his links to rival LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton Chairman Johann Rupert asked shareholders to reject the appointment of Bluebell co-founder Francesco Trapani at the shareholders meeting on Sept. 7, seeking to derail Bluebell's bid to broaden representation on the board of the Cartier jewellery group Trapani was the chief executive of Bulgari when it was bought by LVMH in 2011 and was on LVMH's board of directors from 2011 to 2016 where he was also adviser to Bernard Arnault, its CEO and chairman.""LVMH is one of our company's key competitors,"" Rupert wrote in a letter to shareholders.""The board may not responsibly recommend to shareholders to let a person who has a long history of association with that group - as well as a personal relationship with that group's main shareholder - become a director of our company and intervene in our company's decision-making process,"" he said.Bluebell has been approached for comment.The company, which last year triggered an overhaul at French food group Danone, wants Richemont to concentrate on jewellery and watches rather than online retail.Bluebell told Reuters last month it had been involved in Richemont for 1-1/2 years and had a 105 million Swiss franc ($111 million) stake. Richemont has a market capitalisation of almost 59 billion francs, based on Refinitiv Eikon data.But Bluebell's plans for a board seat have triggered a frosty response from the Richemont chairman, who has said he would not be ""blackmailed"" into making changes.The South African billionaire controls the world's second biggest luxury company via non-listed B-shares which represent 9.1% of the capital, but 50% of the voting rights.Rupert said on Monday shareholders holding ordinary traded A-category shares had the right to board representation but did not think Bluebell, which has ""a relatively small stake in the company, has legitimacy to represent all 'A' shareholders on the Board.""Richemont proposed that existing board member Wendy Luhabe be elected to represent A shareholders. It also recommended shareholders reject Bluebell's proposal for all directors to be categorised as representing A or B shares, and that the number of directors from both shareholder groups be equal.""Activists, particularly with such as small stake, are dreaming if they think they can force through governance changes,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said, adding that any changes were ultimately up to Johann Rupert.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999881982803345}",neutral,0.9999881982803345,0

Why the founder of Diesel jeans wants to build an Italian rival to compete with LVMH and Kering - CNA Luxury,"Mon, 01 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY25hbHV4dXJ5LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vcGVvcGxlL2RpZXNlbC1qZWFucy1yZW56by1yb3Nzby1sdm1oLWtlcmluZy1vbmx5LWJyYXZlLTIwNTQ3NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The founder of jeans label Diesel and owner of fashion brands Jil Sander and Marni has said he wants to build an Italian luxury conglomerate to compete with French groups such as Kering and LVMH.

Renzo Rosso, chair of holding company Only The Brave (OTB), founded Diesel in 1978 aged 23, and went on to build a fashion business that employs 6,000 staff around the world at seven brands.

“Italy doesn’t have a domestic luxury conglomerate like the French ones,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “My plan is to create one.”

OTB has plans for a stock market listing and Rosso is in the process of hiring bankers to advise him. “Of course our [market capitalisation] will be different from the big French groups but my ambition is to show that Italian brands can come together and strengthen each other.”

The European luxury industry has been caught up in some of the effects of sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. In March, the EU barred exports of goods worth more than €300 (S$423) to Russia, in effect ending luxury fashion trade.

But while the likes of Russian president Vladimir Putin are known to be fans of Italian luxury brands, Russia is not a primary destination for the industry.

It is only Italy’s 14th largest global trade partner and according to Italy’s national fashion chamber, the country’s luxury goods exports to Russia amounted to €1.4 billion a year before the war.

“The lockdown in some parts of China has been a much greater concern for me compared to the war in Ukraine in terms of impact on our business,” said Rosso. Russia and Ukraine account for about 2 per cent of OTB’s annual revenues – which grew to €1.53bn in 2021, compared with €1.3bn the previous year. It has no stores in either country.

Asia, on the other hand, is a key market for the group. It opened a branch in South Korea last year and Japan alone makes up 25 per cent of its total revenues.

Rosso said one-third of the group’s investments over the next three years would be focused on expanding in China. OTB currently has 80 stores in the country, where it employs almost 1,000 people. It is aiming to double the number of both stores and staff there by 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999954700469971}",neutral,0.9999954700469971,0
Charles & Keith eyes selling stake - Inside Retail Asia,"Mon, 01 Aug 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAyMi8wOC8wMS9jaGFybGVzLWtlaXRoLWV5ZXMtc2VsbGluZy1zdGFrZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singaporean footwear and accessories brand, Charles & Keith, is eyeing the sale of a 20 per cent stake, a source has told Bloomberg.

The retailer is reported to be working closely with a financial adviser on the deal, which if happens would value the chain at US$2 billion. The source also said the sale is under consideration and Charles & Keith may not proceed with the sale.

The chain was founded by Charles and Keith Wong in 1996. In 2011, the Wong brothers sold a 20 per cent stake to LVMH’s private equity arm, L Captial Asia, for more than US$30 million. The chain has expanded across more than 30 countries with approximately 700 stores.

Since the beginning of this year, Charles & Keith has been rolling out initiatives to attract younger consumers, including appointing South Korean star Krystal Jung as its first global brand ambassador and becoming the first Singaporean fashion label to launch cryptocurrency as a payment mode on its e-commerce site.

The brand also introduced a series of new concept stores with minimal design across Asia and recently collaborated with Spanish artist Coco Captian for a collection.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999908208847046}",neutral,0.9999908208847046,0
