Bernard Arnault Stresses Focus on Quality at LVMH - WWD,"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zdHJlc3Nlcy1mb2N1cy1vbi1xdWFsaXR5LWF0LWx2bWgtNjY4MzU0Ny00MzA5OTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Louis Vuitton will accentuate quality, not quantity, to solidify its position in the marketplace, and to ensure future growth.

That’s the word from luxury titan Bernard Arnault, who elaborated on “adjustments” in Vuitton’s “elitist” strategy as he disclosed a 12 percent bump in 2012 net profits at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — and voiced confidence about the group’s prospects for 2013.

“In some cases, Louis Vuitton has no competitors capable of producing the same quality of leather goods,” Arnault asserted during a results presentation at LVMH headquarters on Thursday. Sounding relaxed and confident, he stressed that it was “vital to heighten the quality lead.”

In a wide-ranging address, Arnault said Vuitton would rein in store openings in 2013 as it did last year, instead focusing efforts on refurbishing and upgrading existing units and providing “superior” customer service.

He said LVMH would continue to resist two quick, but potentially treacherous avenues to accelerate growth: marketing less-expensive, logo-driven products and rolling out stores in secondary cities in China, whose economy is expected to grow at 8 percent this year.

Asked by an analyst to quantify the split between Vuitton’s popular monogram canvas and its leather handbags, Arnault declined to give a breakdown, but said, “Leather is growing significantly faster than the rest, and that’s deliberate.”

Characterizing strong results at LVMH as the natural consequence of quality products and satisfied customers, he alluded to unnamed competitors who continue to roll out stores at a rapid pace. “That’s at their own risk: Short-term it works; longer term it’s questionable.”

LVMH said Vuitton continued its double-digit pace in 2012, and Arnault ensured continuity under the management helm of Michael Burke, who succeeded Jordi Constans at the end of last year after Constans resigned suddenly due to a health condition.

“I’m extremely confident…. I’m absolutely convinced that Michael will be able to drive Vuitton forward into the future,” Arnault said.

“We’re not going to change a strategy that’s successful,” he continued. “We keep the teams that are there and that are successful. They’re motivated and they are passionate about working for this iconic brand.”

Notwithstanding volatile currency fluctuations that will create headwinds for exporters like LVMH, and require price increases in Japan starting Feb. 15, Arnault said his outlook for 2013 is positive, citing a recent “bounce back” in the U.S. and Asia.

He allowed that Europe remains a trouble spot, but “we are selling a lot to visitors so we’re less affected by the economic stagnation than other segments.”

“I believe we can be confident for the overall business climate because the world is growing,” Arnault continued, trumpeting the group’s “exceptional performance” in 2012, headlined by a slight acceleration in sales growth in the fourth quarter, despite a challenging economic context.

LVMH’s net profit rose to 3.4 billion euros, or $4.4 billion, in 2012 as a whole, compared with 3.1 billion euros, or $4.26 billion, in 2011.

In the fourth quarter, sales advanced 12 percent to 8.2 billion euros, or $10.68 billion, versus 7.4 billion euros, or $9.92 billion, in the prior-year period. Dollar figures are converted from euros at average exchange rates for the periods to which they refer.

In organic terms, revenue growth stood at 8 percent, compared with a 6 percent increase in the third quarter. By region, revenues in the fourth quarter gained 12 percent in the United States, excluding Hawaii; 10 percent in Asia; 7 percent in Europe, and 6 percent in Japan.

While LVMH stopped short of giving any sales or earnings guidance for the year ahead, Arnault singled out Fendi, Céline and Berluti among future growth stars.

The latter brand, an elite cobbler being transformed into a luxury men’s lifestyle label by Arnault’s son, Antoine, is expected to generate “several hundred millions of euros” in a few years and, “I believe in three years it will be profitable,” the elder Arnault said.

Investments in Fendi’s expansion, Berluti’s relaunch and Vuitton communications were cited among factors explaining the modest bump in operating profits for fashion and leather goods: 6 percent versus double-digits for all other business divisions.

Pointing to screens overhead showing a scene from Vuitton’s current television, print and cinema campaign in which model Arizona Muse rides in a striped air balloon, Arnault remarked, “It’s less expensive than Brad Pitt.” The allusion to Chanel’s controversial ad for No.5 starring the “Fight Club” and “Moneyball” actor elicited a round of chuckles.

In the year ending Dec. 31, revenues for LVMH, the parent of brands including Bulgari, Guerlain, Givenchy, Sephora and Dom Perignon, rose 19 percent to 28.1 billion euros, or $36.13 billion, from 23.7 billion euros, or $32.94 billion, in 2011.

By business division and in organic terms, sales advanced 6 percent for watches and jewelry; 7 percent for fashion and leather goods; 8 percent for perfumes and cosmetics; 11 percent for wines and spirits, and 14 percent for selective retailing, which includes the DFS and Sephora banners.

Arnault noted that Dior’s J’Adore fragrance ranked number one in France for the third year running, with Guerlain’s La Petite Robe Noir in second place.

LVMH’s figures come on the heels of other company results suggesting the Asian locomotive is running out of steam and that the luxury sector won’t be able to keep up its blistering pace. Last week, Compagnie Financière Richemont reported a slowdown in sales growth in its fiscal third quarter, saying sales in the Asia-Pacific region were flat year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.

Burberry Group plc, meanwhile, said revenues in the three months to Dec. 31 climbed 11.3 percent, although sales on the shop floor remain soft as the macroeconomic situation weighs on customer sentiment, particularly for “aspirational” shoppers.

During Thursday’s presentation, Arnault waved off a question about his controversial quest to seek Belgian citizenship, preferring to tout the luxury goods sector as a principle driver of the French economy, and pointing out that LVMH hired 2,000 workers in France last year as it opened more workshops.

He also trumpeted the group’s entrepreneurial spirit, likening his “command teams” at various brands to “drones, not 747s loaded wall-to-wall with accounts.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9939725995063782}",positive,0.9939725995063782,1
LVMH collaborates with TDIC to build one of the biggest malls in UAE - Luxurylaunches,"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3JlYWxfZXN0YXRlL2x2bWgtY29sbGFib3JhdGVzLXdpdGgtdGRpYy10by1idWlsZC1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWJpZ2dlc3QtbWFsbHMtaW4tdWFlLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

That Louis Vuitton is the leading name in luxury is not unknown. Like a magic wand, Louis Vuitton transforms its products into exquisite pieces of luxury. In fact, Louis Vuitton and luxury are today synonyms. So we commend the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) who has decided to hire the expertise of the famed luxury brand Louis Vuitton to build a 168,000 square meter luxury mall on Saadiyat Island connecting to Abu Dhabi’s three planned mega museums. The developer, TDIC, announced that it had formed a joint venture with L Real Estate, a private equity fund in which the Louis Vuitton owner LVMH is a minority investor. The mall, christened “The District” mall, is touted to become one of the biggest malls in UAE and would form a triangle between the three museums.





The mall is expected to house more than 550 stores, many of which would be outdoors. The retail destination would be home to all types of stores from luxury and fashion brands, department stores, home furnishing chains to art galleries and family entertainment venues.



The three-story mall would be classified into four zones. Three of the four – Luxury Street, Canal, and Main Street zones – would be located outdoors on two levels. Luxury Street is expected to boast of elite fashion stores, while Canal would include cafes and restaurants next to a canal opposite the Guggenheim. The Main Street zone would include stores and outdoor cafes.



L Real Estate, specializing in luxury shopping, will collaborate with TDIC to develop the mall on a 17-hectare plot of land in the new cultural district. The construction for the mall is expected to begin in 2014, and it is expected to be completed by 2017 to coincide with the opening of the Abu Dhabi Guggenheim Museum.

LVMH highlighted the “on-going strengthening of the market positions of DFS and Sephora due to their innovative products and services.”

According to the Group, DFS benefitted from momentum among Asian customers. Three major concessions were won in 2012 at Hong Kong Airport and the concession at Los Angeles Airport was renewed. “The opening in Hong Kong of a third Galleria is also a key highlight of the year,” it added.

Serpenti and B.Zerol collections, enriched by new creations, and reinforced the quality of its distribution,” adds LVMH.

LVMH was impressed by the performance of the Sephora stores and “online revenue is growing strongly”. In Europe, new stores opened for the first time in Denmark and Sweden.

In the United States, the renovation of several flagship stores in New York “strengthened the appeal of the brand”. Sephora expanded in China and its first stores were opened in Brazil and India.

Going forward, the Group says it will maintain a strategy focused on developing its brands by continuing to build up its ‘savoir-faire’, as well as through strong innovation and expansion in fast growing markets.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Denied Belgian Passport - Sky News,"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2x2bWhzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1kZW5pZWQtYmVsZ2lhbi1wYXNzcG9ydC0xMDQ1ODE2NNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZGVuaWVkLWJlbGdpYW4tcGFzc3BvcnQtMTA0NTgxNjQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France's richest man has reportedly had his request for Belgian nationality rejected for a second time, as controversy rages over actor Gerard Depardieu's tax exile bid.

Like fellow Frenchman Depardieu, Bernard Arnault's request last December for Belgian citizenship caused uproar in France even though the head of LVMH, the world's largest luxury empire, insisted he was not seeking to avoid high French taxes.

But a spokesman told Belgian daily newspaper De Morgen: ""The prosecutor's office has passed its opinion to the naturalisation commission of the parliament and it is negative.""

Forbes magazine ranks Mr Arnault as the world's fourth-richest man with a fortune estimated at £25bn.

The Belgian interior ministry also rejected Mr Arnault's request last December, on the basis that he had not lived in Belgium for three years, but this still leaves an avenue open to him.

Members of parliament have the right to vote on Mr Arnault's application - even if he does not meet the three-year residence requirement - if he can show that he has ""real links"" with Belgium.

To prove that is the case, Mr Arnault and LVMH argued that they ""have truly bona fide economic activities"" in Belgium, where the company has several units.

But at the end of last year the Belgian government suggested it might transfer files on Mr Arnault to France amid concerns that such LVMH operations could be little more than front companies - a charge rejected forcefully.

De Morgen said the prosecutor's office told MPs it was looking into the structure of the companies set up in Belgium ""and that uncertainties over these financial structures had played a part in its decision.""

"After Depardieu, Belgian plan by France's richest man fuels 75% tax row - The Guardian","Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2phbi8yNC9iZWxnaWFuLW1vdmUtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWZyYW5jZS10YXjSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy9qYW4vMjQvYmVsZ2lhbi1tb3ZlLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1mcmFuY2UtdGF4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, not only wants to become Belgian, he has moved a large part of his fortune north of the border, it was claimed on Thursday.

The billionaire head of the luxury goods group Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, who has applied for Belgian nationality, was reported to have transferred his share in the family group that controls LVMH to a firm set up for the purpose in Belgium, where taxes are lower.

A spokesperson for Arnault, 63, insisted he was not trying to escape the French taxman, but attempting to preserve the company in case he died suddenly. But the revelation reopened the controversy over Socialist president François Hollande's proposed ""supertax"" of 75% on earnings over €1m (£850,000) a year.

The high-rate tax, put on hold after France's constitutional court ruled it unfair and unconstitutional at the end of December, has been blamed for pushing a number of celebrated French citizens, including the actor Gérard Depardieu, into tax exile.

On Thursday there were also conflicting reports over whether Hollande would force through the controversial tax. Europe 1 radio reported the government had decided to ""bury"" the idea of a 75% band, a claim that was later denied by the Elysée Palace.

Nicolas Demorand, editor of Libération, which carried the story on its front page, lambasted Arnault for ""forgetting the country which has made him a king"". He said the businessman was ""running the risk of fuelling suspicions about him which could harm the image of his brands and weaken the employees who bring them to life"".

Libération claimed Arnault transferred his 31% stake in Groupe Arnault, a family firm that runs LVMH to a Belgian company called Pilinvest, in December 2011, six months before Hollande took office. That stake, the newspaper said, is worth €6.5bn.

Arnault was reported to have set up a foundation in Belgium, Protectinvest, which will take control of Pilinvest if he were to die before 2023. This would allow his five children, to whom he has already handed over a large percentage of shares in the family group, to be paid dividends but be prevented from selling their shares or exercising their voting rights. After 2023 the family would regain full control.

Sources close to the businessman, who insists he intends to keep paying taxes in France, said the move was intended to avoid damage to the group from family disputes over inheritance. However, inheritance tax in Belgium is only 3% compared with 11% in France, and Belgium has no wealth tax, unlike France.

Arnault's request for Belgian nationality has been turned down, but the final decision has yet to be made by the country's parliament.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999758780002594}",neutral,0.999758780002594,0

Before today, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault last appeared on the cover of French daily Libération in September, next to the headline, Casse-toi riche con! or “Get the Eff Out, Rich Idiot.” The reason behind the kind words: Bernie had applied for dual French-Belgian citizenship, sparking rumors that he’d be moving to Belgium to avoid his country’s proposed 75 percent tax on those who make more than €1 million ($1.32 million). But Arnault has maintained that he would stay a fiscal resident of France, even after a lawmaker there claimed Belgium was “in need of” Arnault, likely said by SMS while he was weeping to Firehouse.

Why the front-page treatment, again? WWD writes:

Now the newspaper is probing details on a plan it says he has set up for his Belgian foundation, under the headline: “Les secrets belges de Bernard Arnault,” whose translation is “The Belgian Secrets of Bernard Arnault.”

And the Telegraph (via the Financial Times) shares one of the secrets: Arnault has officially moved his £5 billion ($7.9 billion) fortune from France to Belgium, in case he kicks it before 2023.

The move will protect a break-up of the brands he has acquired over the past 30 years when he dies. Through a private foundation called Protectinvest, which will only become operational when Arnault, 63, dies, his five children would be unable to sell LVMH shares within the next 10 years, reports the Financial Times. France’s legal systems do not have such private foundations in place, hence why the neighbouring country was chosen.

Perhaps unpatriotic, Arnault knows what he’s doing when it comes to dollar dollar bills, as evidenced by his large collection of them. Realistically speaking, there aren’t many people in the world who could responsibly handle $8 billion. And we won’t pretend to be on that short list. We’ve heard of some debit card that gives you 3 percent back on groceries, but the paperwork is a drag.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998995065689087}",neutral,0.9998995065689087,0

Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH group which controls over 60 luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Céline and Marc Jacobs, has officially transferred his £5 billion fortune out of France and into Belgium.

Europe's richest man insists that he will remain ""fiscally domiciled in France"" and that the move will protect a break-up of the brands he has acquired over the past 30 years when he dies.

Through a private foundation called Protectinvest, which will only become operational when Arnault, 63, dies, his five children would be unable to sell LVMH shares within the next 10 years, reports the Financial Times.

France's legal systems do not have such private foundations in place, hence why the neighbouring country was chosen.

Protectinvest was set up in 2008 and stipulates that none of Arnault's children can sit on its board - only administrators over the age of 50. By 2023 Arnault's youngest child would be 25, an age deemed old enough to assume responsibility for LVMH.

Last year Arnault applied for dual citizenship in Belgium, where taxes for the rich are not as high, after France's new President, Francois Hollande, planned to introduce a new 75 per cent tax rate on earnings over €1 million.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999518394470215}",neutral,0.9999518394470215,0
HauteTime Gets Insight of Roger Dubuis from CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué at SIHH in Geneva - Luxury Watch Trends ... - Haute Time,"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vaGF1dGV0aW1lLWdldHMtaW5zaWdodC1vZi1yb2dlci1kdWJ1aXMtZnJvbS1jZW8tamVhbi1tYXJjLXBvbnRyb3VlLWF0LXNpaGgtaW4tZ2VuZXZhLzE3MzAwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Roger Dubuis and Haute Time Managing Editor Seth Semilof

One of the exciting booths of SIHH, had to go to Roger Dubuis. They were the talk of the show, as they had an eagle on guard for four hours a day, getting the brand a lot of attention. As I had an appointment to interview Roger Dubuis Global CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué, I ran into Haute Living Art Basel Cover Daphne Guinness who was in town promoting her collaboration with Roger Dubuis. I also ran into the famous Mr. Dubuis, who is back at the company, which showed some of the amazing pieces launched at SIHH this year.

The first watch was the talk of the show—The Roger Dubuis Excalibur Quatuor. You may ask, what is this? It is the world’s first silicon watch incorporating four sprung balances. This is one of the most innovative watches out on the market, and is a huge advance in watchmaking. The watch is featured in a 48mm pink gold case, with a tourbillon, along with power reserve and pink gold appliqués, with the Geneva seal. The watch is manually wound with the Roger Dubuis Caliber RD101, with four intricately placed escapements.

The next watch I saw, was my favorite the Roger Dubuis Excalibur 42 Skeleton Tourbillon. This watch combines the flying tourbillon with the skeleton look, making it one of the most special watches created by Roger Dubuis. Roger Dubuis specifically creates its skeleton movements for this purpose, an approach that enables it to offer skeleton movements crafted in a modern fashion and which are both lighter and bolder. There are over 165 parts in this watch, which uses the RD5055SQ mechanical movement in a 42mm case. The watch we saw was in Pink Gold, with White Gold also being available.

The next watch was Roger Dubuis Excalibur Table Ronde. This watch is unique, as it has 12 gold figurines of knights with swords that are similar to watch hands telling time. The watch is limited to 28 pieces, making the watch an evocation of the Round Table at the heart of the King Arthur legend.

The next watch is the Roger Dubuis Excalibur 42 Automatic. The shape we saw was in steel, and it is a very beautiful piece, while affordable. The watches are powered by the automatic mechanical movement RD640 comprising 198 components.

The next piece was really beautiful for the lady. This watch is part of the Excalibur 36 jewelry collection. The watch is in pink gold, with a satin-finished bracelet, making this a very special piece. The bezel is set with 48 diamonds with the bracelet 708 brillant-cut diamonds totally 4.25 carats.

We love what Roger Dubuis is doing, and had a lot of fun visiting them at SIHH. We see a lot of cool things coming from the brand, and look forward to seeing more throughout the year. It was great to also get a video Interview on the vision of Roger Dubuis Global CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué, as he is a pure expert in luxury. His insight into the brand, and future of the brand shows big things to come.

European luxury ETFs offer “structural growth opportunity” - ETF Strategy,"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldGZzdHJhdGVneS5jb20vZXVyb3BlYW4tbHV4dXJ5LWV0ZnMtb2ZmZXItc3RydWN0dXJhbC1ncm93dGgtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktYXMtbHZtaC1wcHItcmljaGVtb250LWFuZC1idXJiZXJyeS1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tZ3Jvd2luZy1lbWVyZ2luZy1tYXJrZXQtbWlkZGxlLWNsYXNzLTk4NjIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European luxury goods sector has risen strongly in the last three months, driven by a discernible improvement in sentiment. Sentiment has improved the most in Asia and China, with rising confidence in the region a result of a smooth transition of leadership in China.

The MSCI Europe Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods Index has gained 21.5%, while the broader MSCI Europe Consumer Discretionary Index, which includes Europe’s high-end automobile manufacturers, an important luxury segment, has added 14.1%.

To put this performance into perspective, the MSCI World Consumer Discretionary Index managed only 9.9% during this period, while the MSCI Europe Index lagged further behind, adding just 8.5%.

According to a recent report from Nomura, the Tokyo-headquartered investment bank, a number of datapoints allude to an improvement in luxury fortunes in Asia – the most important region for luxury goods companies. In particular, the bank points to a strong start to 2013 for Macao gaming revenues; accelerating Swiss watch sales data in China; and an improvement in retail sales in Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong (all major consumers of luxury goods).

Anecdotal comments are also supportive of the sector. For example, Chow Tai Fook, a Hong Kong-based jeweller with over 1,000 stores in mainland China, suggested that fewer retailers exited the sector in Q4. Similarly, European luxury brands including Swatch, Ferragamo and Burberry have all commented on an improved macroeconomic environment.

That said, concerns remain. According to Nomura, air cargo data, typically indicative of economic growth, have shown three months of deterioration and European and US domestic same-store sales remain challenged, though weakness in the US could be linked to Hurricane Sandy and fiscal cliff concerns.

However, while caution is needed, Nomura is bullish on the sector: “We continue to see a more positive outlook for luxury goods, with upside risk to organic sales in 2013. We would use any weakness on short-term trading to enter the sector for the long term, which we see as a structural growth opportunity.”

This long-term outlook is underpinned by powerful cultural, economic and demographic trends in developing countries which should continue to support robust growth for luxury goods. For example, emerging markets are forecast to account for 73% of global luxury goods sales by 2020, with China surging to a 44% share from just 15% today. Behind this anticipated growth is the expansion of the middle class. The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), for instance, are expected to have over one billion middle-class consumers by 2015, a gain of almost 400 million over 2010.

When it comes to luxury, Europe rules. The region (including the UK) is home to some of the world’s best known and admired luxury brands; brands which the newly wealthy in emerging markets aspire to own. Listed European luxury companies include LVMH, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Tag Heur; Compagnie Financiere Richemont, owner of brands such as Louis Cartier, Montblanc and Alfred Dunhill; PPR, the firm behind Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney and Brioni, among others; Burberry; Christian Dior; Luxottica, which owns Ray-Ban and Oakley; Hugo Boss; Daimler, owner of Mercedes Benz; BMW; and Porsche, to name but a few.

Usefully for investors, all the above companies are included in the MSCI Europe Consumer Discretionary Index. This means that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) benchmarked to the index provide investors with an efficient low-cost means of accessing luxury brands (luxury brands comprise about 50% of the index).

And for investors concerned about taking on exposure to Europe, it’s worth noting that these companies generate a significant proportion of their sales from outside of Europe. For example, Richemont, LVMH, PPR, Burberry and Luxottica do only around a third or less of their business in Europe. Moreover, luxury sales recorded in Europe are often to foreign tourists from countries such as China and Japan. Thus the actual economic exposure to Europe is less than a simple revenue breakdown would suggest.

UK and European investors looking to access this index have a couple of funds at their disposal:

Amundi ETF MSCI Europe Consumer Discretionary (CD6)

Top three holdings are Daimler, LVMH and Compagnie Financiere Richemont.Listed on the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana. Total Expense Ratio (TER) 0.25% per annum.

Top three holdings are Daimler, LVMH and Compagnie Financiere Richemont. Listed on Euronext Paris, Deutsche Börse, Borsa Italiana, and SIX Swiss Exchange. Registered across much of Europe including the UK (inc UK Fund Reporting Status). TER 0.30%

Unfortunately for US-based investors there’s no single, locally listed fund that truly targets the sector. More generally, US investors could consider the iShares S&P Global Consumer Discretionary Sector Index ETF (RXI), the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX ETF (FXD), the PowerShares Dynamic Consumer Discretionary ETF (PEZ) or the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR), which offer exposure to consumer discretionary stocks, including the luxury segment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999245285987854}",positive,0.999245285987854,1

Bernard Arnault, the 63-year-old head of luxury goods group LVMH, insists that he moved the cash and assets for 'family inheritance reasons

The richest man in France has officially transferred his multi-billion pound fortune out of his homeland to Belgium.

Bernard Arnault, head of luxury goods group LVMH, insists he has moved his assets for ‘family inheritance reasons’.

But others are convinced that the 63-year-old has joined other tycoons and celebrities in wanting to avoid taxes – including a 75 per cent top rate on income – introduced by Socialist President Francois Hollande.

Mr Arnault applied for a Belgian passport soon after the Socialists won elections last year.

Mr Arnault, who owns numerous homes around the world including one in London, applied for a Belgian passport soon after Mr Hollande’s Socialists won presidential and parliamentary elections last year.

Critics immediately attacked him for leaving the country that is associated with all the brands which made his fortune - including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac.

Nicolas Demorand, the editor of national newspaper Liberation, attacked him for ‘forgetting the country which has made him King’, adding : ‘Bernard Arnault is running the risk of fuelling suspicion about him, harming the image of his brands and weakening the employees who give them life.’

Mr Arnault has transferred his 31 per cent stake in Groupe Arnault, the family holding that controls LVMH, to Pilinvest, a Belgian firm that he specifically set up for the purpose.



The stake is worth around 5.5 billion pounds, and Mr Arnault insists he wants to keep it in the hands of his five children after he dies.

He has established a structure destined to prevent any of them selling their shares in the event of his death.

Critics have attacked him for leaving the country associated with all the brands which made his fortune - including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac

It is believed he is trying to avoid taxes including a 75 per cent top rate on income being introduced by President Francois Hollande

A source close to him said the structure was lawful in Belgium, but would not be so in France.

‘He has got two obsessions - controlling his group and ensuring that it survives him,’ said the source.

Earlier this year, Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu became another high-profile Frenchman moving his assets abroad

The Belgian Office of Foreigners has suggested it might block Mr Arnault’s request for a passport, but the final decision will be taken by the Brussels parliament.

Belgium has a much more lenient tax regime than France – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent, compared to11 per cent in France. Unlike France, there is no wealth tax in Belgium either.

Mr Arnault is also likely to be concerned by Mr Hollande’s plan to bring capital gains tax in line with income tax – effectively raising it from 19 per cent to 45 per cent, and possibly to 75 per cent if the Socialist President goes through with his threat to make that the top income tax rate for earnings over €1 million a year.

Earlier this year, Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu became another high-profile Frenchman moving his assets abroad.



The Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac card obtained a Russian passport, bought a house in Belgium, and put his multi-million pounds Paris town house on the market.

Louis Vuitton linked firm to help develop luxury mall in Abu Dhabi - The National,"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1saW5rZWQtZmlybS10by1oZWxwLWRldmVsb3AtbHV4dXJ5LW1hbGwtaW4tYWJ1LWRoYWJpLTEuNjM0MDU30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A developer with ties to the owner of the Louis Vuitton designer label is to help build a 168,000 square metre luxury mall on Saadiyat Island connecting to Abu Dhabi's three planned mega museums.

The Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), the master developer behind the ambitious Saadiyat Island project which includes the Louvre, Guggenheim and Zayed National Museum, yesterday announced it had formed a joint venture with L Real Estate, a private equity fund in which the Louis Vuitton owner LVMH is a minority investor.

It plans to develop what is expected to be one of the largest shopping centres in the emirate.

TDIC said “The District” mall would form a triangle between the three museums, providing shoppers with spectacular views of them and the Arabian Gulf.

It said detailed design work on the mall was about to start while construction is scheduled to start in 2014 and to be completed by 2017 to coincide with the opening of the Abu Dhabi Guggenheim Museum.

The mall is to comprise more than 550 stores, many of which would be outdoors, and include luxury and fashion brands, department stores, home furnishing chains, art galleries and family entertainment venues.

L Real Estate, a property development and investment fund sponsored by LVMH, which specialises in luxury shopping, will work alongside TDIC to develop the three-storey mall on a 17-hectare plot of land in the new cultural district.

“This new retail destination – ideally sits among Saadiyat’s inspiring museums, beautiful landscape and coastal environment – will be a regional attraction and a highly prized sought-after location for Abu Dhabi’s communities and visitors when it opens by 2017,” said TDIC’s chairman, Sheikh Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan.

TDIC said the mall would have four zones. Three of the four – Luxury Street, Canal and Main Street zones – would be located outdoors on two levels. Luxury Street would comprise a promenade of elite fashion stores while Canal would include cafes and restaurants next to a canal opposite the Guggenheim. The Main Street zone would also include stores and outdoor cafes.
