LVMH, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior, is the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, with revenue reaching about $59 billion in 2019.

In 2020, the company, like the rest of the luxury sector, was economically impacted by the pandemic and store closures throughout the world. In the first nine months of the year, it recorded revenue of €30 billion ($37 billion), down 21% from this time last year.

Recruitment criteria

For LVMH group

They look for 3 things: creativity, specific sets of skills that are needed to the job and an amazing personnality that can fit to the Maison and the team. The soft skills and personnality are what will make the difference, try to understand who you are and what difference you will be able to make to the team. Bring your enthousiasm and show you’re unique. The diversity of our teams is what makes our team so special.

For GIVENCHY

What is really important : craft, innovation and conventions. 58 interns, 33 apprentices in 11 departments. Committed to train them and to follow them closely, as a community. A lot of opportunities as interns in design, product development and communication.

For KENZO

They are looking for interns in product development and interns for the studios : a good portfolio and to be able to see what your inspirations are.

For CELINE

Looking for authencity, excellence, passion.

Student questions

I would like to apply for the LVMH graduate program:

The program is in standby. The idea was to make the leader of tomorrow, and they would need to meet the students, be with them for that and it doesn’t work well with the lockdown. So they will launch it later, whenever the context seems better, but they don’t have a date.

What kind of profiles are they looking for?

Master level, Masters two languages, international experience, passionate and talented but with the topics of today (diversity, sustainability). Someone who can work in France or in Italy in terms of visa.

I’m a graphic designer, what would you look for as an intern?

We would need to see your graphic work, a portfolio that is suitable for a Maison.

We would give you a point of view regarding our Maison, so not an absolute one.

Your personality is also very important. Be yourself and make the difference in some ways. You have to understand what we need and being a bit adaptable. The creative person will live in an environment, he cannot be alone anymore.

You have to apply to a job offer listed on our website, this is the main door to be visible and selected.

How do all your brands anticipate the post-pandemic? How will it affect the recruitment of graduates?

In terms of internships and apprentices, we haven’t stopped recruiting, we are still looking for a lot of people.

Does LVMH/ respective mansions sponsor visas for internships or is this typically for junior or senior roles?

Most of the time, we offer a 6-Month full-time internship.

The internship is part of the education so the visa goes through the school. We try to work with the schools to help them work with the authorities. And it depends on each country too. The authorities don’t know anything about fashion but we have to prove that the person we’re recruiting has skills that nobody in France has, so it’s very complicated.

For internships in the atelier for fashion design students, do each of the brands prioritize looking for different skills in the portfolio (sketching, draping. Etc) based on how each studio works?

It depends on each studio.

Which schools are you usually working with?

We work with different types of schools, it depends a lot on the internship. We are open minded and we can work with French schools as well as International ones. The important thing is to have a convention de stage, without it, you can’t do an internship in France. Usually our internships last 6 months. We don’t really have official partnerships with schools because what is important is talent, there are no boundaries.

I would like to kindly ask about the process of applying as a freelancer in one of your respected maisons?

It depends a lot on the Maison, you can still apply to job offers. You should also build your network even now, when you’re still at school. You can start networking with your schoolmates because they will become your colleagues. Work on your network and keep in touch.

Majority of internship offers are hidden, this is why networking is crucial

At Kenzo, most of the offers are online. In the studios, it might more depend on relations with schools. But most of the time, the offers are online.

How can we apply spontaneously?

Check the recruitment email address where we received spontaneous applications. We do a lot of campus management inside the schools, with recruiters coming to you in schools. Celine adds all the offers in the website. Address for Givenchy: givenchyrecrute@givenchy.com

Is it better to apply through the website or linkedin?

Better on the website for internships.

Will LVMH De-Americanize Tiffany? - Jing Daily,"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnktYW1lcmljYW5pemUtY2FydGllci1mZW50edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,":

Tiffany and LVMH may seem like a match made in heaven since both companies belong to “The Old Guard” of luxury, have a people-centric approach, and understand how to listen to their customers, but there are cultural issues at play.

Tiffany has an impressive market share in Mainland China, and a recent UBS survey showed that Chinese buyers see Tiffany as a “go-to jewelry brand, second only to Cartier.”

We can expect Tiffany to invest in the expansion of its physical retail footprint, continue to push art-and-luxury crossovers, and go through a brand relaunch.

Last month, the media announced that a merger between two luxury titans had finally concluded. After settling a very public battle, Tiffany & Co. and LVMH have agreed to a price cut of 425 million, green-lighting the biggest merger the luxury world has ever seen. Now, industry experts are wondering what’s in store for Tiffany & Co., with the French conglomerate having taken full control of the American brand.

In a 2007 article , Susanne Hilger wrote about “Globalization by Americanization” by arguing that highly-industrialized American companies had “prepared the way for globalization.” The writer also highlights how, in post-WWII Germany, domestic enterprises employed American know-how and management strategies to keep up with their American rivals.

During the twentieth century, American companies were a symbol of entrepreneurship, industrialism, hard work, and trust. But the situation changed in the early 2000s when constant scandals stained the global vision of American capitalism. Various corporate scandals included fraudulent accounting methods , unethical behavior from executives , corruption , moral violations by employees, business ethics abuses, and managerial errors . Accordingly, the global audience stopped seeing American companies as beacons of success and leadership. And just as the world turned away from America, some European powers began promoting Eurocentrism.

As such, it will be interesting to see how two proud-yet-incompatible cultures from France and the US can come together and promote intercultural dialogue. In fact, the Harvard Business Review highlighted how cultural incompatibility is a big reason why mergers fail. And although Tiffany and LVMH might seem like a match made in heaven at first sight — both belong to “The Old Guard” of luxury, have people-centric approaches, and understand how to listen to their customers — the reality is far more complex.

All LVMH fashion, leather, watches, and jewelry brands are European, except for the Australian boots brand R. M. Williams that LVMH agreed to sell to the private equity group Tattarang this October . And even though LVMH owns brands like Ao Yun and Benefit Cosmetics and partnered with Rihanna for her Fenty Beauty line, the group remains a quintessentially Western European company, and, above all, the epitome of the French culture.

But one thing that both sides of this merger have in common is an interest in expanding their businesses in China. Tiffany has an impressive market share in Mainland China, and a recent UBS survey showed that Chinese buyers see Tiffany “as a go-to jewelry brand , second only to Cartier.” Furthermore, Tiffany’s operating earnings for August and September of 2020 indicate that the Tiffany T1 line performed well in China , and CEO Alessandro Bogliolo’s ambitious China growth strategy has been a continuous success thus far.

With its “Vision & Virtuosity” exhibition in Shanghai, Tiffany pulled a page from LVMH’s playbook, as the French conglomerate is a pioneer in supporting artists, regularly engaging in partnerships with museums and art foundations.

The opening of its Blue Box Café in Shanghai is also in line with LVMH’s strategy of experiential retail. In fact, last February, Louis Vuitton opened Le Café V in Osaka last February along with a restaurant called Sugalabo.

Additionally, both players moved further away from the traditional luxury buyer by chasing the new luxury demographics of affluent millennials and Gen Zers. In an interview with CNN Business , Tiffany & Co. CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said that “80 percent of consumers of luxury in China are millennials.” As such, his recent efforts are concentrated on attracting a demographic that values brand recognition, in-store technology, and personalized designs.

Since taking the helm of the company, Bogliolo has further embraced technology with the launch of the brand’s Chinese e-commerce platforms, which are focused on brand design (with the debut of the T1 collection) and have expanded Tiffany’s market share in Asia-Pacific.

What should Chinese customers expect from the merger?

With an infusion of capital and savoir-faire coming from LVMH, we anticipate that Tiffany will invest in the expansion of its physical retail footprint. Tiffany won’t be present everywhere, but strategic store openings in lower-tier cities are likely to happen. “If this acquisition can speed Tiffany’s entry into the massive China market, everyone wins,” said Cathy Hotka, Principal, Cathy Hotka & Associates to RetailWire .

Also, it is expected that Tiffany will continue to pursue a marketing strategy focused on emotional experiences and exhibitions. Blurring the boundaries between art and luxury is a tactical move that will help the American brand communicate its heritage and legacy to a new generation of consumers.

Lastly, a possible brand relaunch might be in the cards. When LVMH acquired a majority stake in Rimowa, the French conglomerate came up with a new visual identity and voice for the German luggage manufacturer.

If history can teach us anything, it is that Bernard Arnault is not afraid of taking risks with his brands."

What the future holds for LVMH's 24S - Glossy,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3doYXQtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1ob2xkcy1mb3ItbHZtaHMtMjRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ian Rogers, former senior director of Apple Music who served as LVMH’s chief digital officer for the last five years, left his position on Monday; he’ll move to an advisory role at LVMH while he pursues a career outside of the fashion industry.

Rogers made a mark on LVMH, successfully pushing the company to be more innovative in areas artificial intelligence and starting the annual LVMH Innovation Award. Some efforts, however, like the continued attempts to make 24S into a competitor against Richemont’s Net-a-Porter, haven’t gained much traction.

Rogers was brought on board specifically to innovate the group’s online retail efforts. 24S, which he helped found in 2017, was among the biggest attempts. Since its launch, the e-commerce site rebranded from its initial name of 24 Sevres and shifted focus to an international customer. But it failed to innovate in key areas like mobile.

Through his work on 24S, Rogers helped LVMH prepare for a year when online shopping exploded in popularity, even in the luxury sector. Under Rogers’ leadership, the company increased digital sales to more than 10% from under 5% of its total revenue. But LVMH still has a way to go to compete with its rivals on e-commerce.

LVMH, despite being a market leader in luxury, has lagged behind its rivals in e-commerce. Richemont’s Net-a-Porter has been growing for the last five years, bringing in close to $1 billion last year. Richemont also just joined with Alibaba to invest in another luxury e-commerce leader, Farfetch. Kering, meanwhile, has focused on e-commerce at the brand level, rather than multi-brand marketplaces. Its portfolio brands saw a 72% swell in e-commerce sales over the last six months.

24S is much earlier in its lifecycle than other multi-brand luxury e-commerce platforms. It lacks the breadth of categories of Farfetch, which carries a wide variety of brands as well as resale. It just launched menswear last year.

In February, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said in an earnings call that 24S had been losing money since it was founded and that the company had yet to crack exactly what kind of consumer it wants to court with the platform. In an October earnings call, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said 24S’ performance during the pandemic was improved enough to compensate for store closures, but “we wouldn’t call this a full and lasting success yet.”

Reflecting on his time at LVMH, Rogers said in a blog post on Monday that this was because luxury fashion companies — particularly at LVMH, where the CEO has continued to question the importance of e-commerce as recently as February — are stuck in the past. “Traditional industries had put the internet in a ‘technical’ silo and completely missed the fact that their customers had grown an extension of their hand,” he said.

“Historically, luxury companies like LVMH have shied away from e-commerce and only recently, seemingly grudgingly, started to list product details online, followed by finally enabling commerce,” said Raghav Sharma, co-founder of Perfitly, an AR shopping company that works with luxury brands like Otero Menswear. Brands like Chanel still resist e-commerce, keeping its online offerings to a minimum. “It stemmed from a fear of not delivering the experience they wanted to give to their clients and that [customers] associated with the brand, not to mention having very different supply chains from more mass appeal brands.”

Another facet of LVMH’s e-commerce struggles is that it lacks an extensive partnership with a strong Chinese partner like Alibaba’s Tmall, which has become the go-to gateway for Western luxury brands into the Chinese market. Only a small handful of LVMH brands sell on the platform, starting with Kenzo in January. 24S is meant to be LVMH’s main online platform for China, but it doesn’t have the same reach or depth of penetration in China as Tmall’s Luxury Pavilion. The Chinese version of 24S just launched in early November.

In Rogers’ place, Chris de LaPuente, who had been CEO of Sephora for the last 10 years, will oversee 24S as LVMH’s newly created role of CEO of selective retailing. 24S’ CEO Eric Goguey will report directly to him. De LaPuente helped forge Sephora into an e-commerce juggernaut, growing its annual online sales to nearly $1 billion.

His expertise will be needed, since LVMH has little interest in selling through any online platforms other than its own. Only a handful of LVMH’s brands sell through Matches Fashion and Farfetch, not including heavy hitters like Louis Vuitton and Dior. Most are restricted to 24S and their individual brands’ online stores.

“What this complicated period has shown us is that there is a validity in the vertical e-commerce system for all the brands,” said Guiony in a conference call with analysts last week. “Online will continue to develop, [but] certainly not at the speed we’ve seen this year, which was definitely a function of stores being closed.”"
Tiffany Shareholders Approve LVMH's $15.8B Offer - WWD,"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3RpZmZhbnktYW5kLWx2bWgtZmluYWxpemUtbWVyZ2VyLTEyMzQ2ODc4NjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton have made their new deal official.

Tiffany shareholders approved the updated agreement for LVMH to acquire the iconic American jeweler, which was announced in October, at a special shareholders’ meeting Wednesday morning, with nearly 99 percent voting in favor of the deal, or more than 88 million votes for the merger and only about 107,000 against it.

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” Roger Farah, chairman of the board of directors of Tiffany, said in October. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

The new deal replaces the original November 2019 agreement with a $131.50 in cash per share purchase price, compared with the original offer of $135 a share. That equals about $420 million in savings for LVMH. The two parties also agreed to settle pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court. The final purchase price is $15.8 billion.

After the deal is complete, Tiffany will no longer be a public company, but an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of parent company LVMH, thus joining a stable of luxury brands that includes Dior, Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Givenchy and Berluti, not to mention jewelers Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred.



The deal gives luxury titan Bernard Arnault a multibillion dollar U.S. company — and one of the few American brands that are truly luxury and wholly control their distribution. Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and catapulted to a higher plane by his son Lewis Comfort Tiffany, the jeweler has served the wealthy — both old and new money — ever since it was established. As of the end of March, it operated 326 stores worldwide.

LVMH first agreed to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion late last year in what is the largest acquisition in the luxury space. But that was pre-pandemic.

After the coronavirus began making its way around the globe, causing mass shutdowns, LVMH seemed to get cold feet. The French group said it was walking away from the deal in September.

First, the luxury giant said it couldn’t go ahead with the deal because of a letter from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, which it described as an order to hold off on the deal given a separate trade spat between Paris and Washington, D.C.

Later, Le Drian told the French parliament that, “My role is to apply, whenever appropriate, the government’s opinion on an assessment of a political nature regarding the management of major international events to come. That is the reason why I replied to a question from the LVMH group, totally in my role.”

That led to the suggestion that LVMH and the company’s chairman and chief executive officer Arnault used its political clout to enlist the French government’s help to get out of the deal.

Tiffany chairman Farah said at the time, “As we are not aware of any other French company receiving such a [governmental] request, it is all the more clear that LVMH has unclean hands.”

Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH chief financial officer, responded to the accusations by telling a reporter, “You must be joking. Are you seriously suggesting that we procured the letter? I don’t even want to answer that question. [The letter from the French government] was fully unsolicited.”

The affair got increasingly ugly after LVMH threatened to sue Tiffany for “dishonesty,” mismanagement, poor performance and clauses in the contract.

LVMH also charged that Tiffany’s lawsuit in Delaware was “communicated in a misleading way to shareholders and is defamatory.”

In a brief statement in September, LVMH said it was surprised by the legal action, which it said was “totally unfounded.”

“LVMH will defend itself vigorously. The long preparation of this assignment demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH. This action is essentially based on the accusation by Tiffany that LVMH failed to take the reasonably necessary steps to obtain the various regulatory authorities’ approvals in a timely way,” the statement said. “This accusation has no substance and LVMH will demonstrate this to the Delaware Court. On this matter, the filing in Brussels will take place, as expected, in the following days and this is simply the result of the planning fixed by the European Commission, about which Tiffany is completely aware. It is legitimate to expect this authorization will be obtained in October.”

At the same time, the luxury giant added that it was disappointed in Tiffany’s management during the coronavirus crisis, which has put a strong dent in luxury sales and consumer appetite, and vowed to challenge Tiffany and its board of directors on this failing.

“The first-half results and its perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period,” LVMH said in the September statement.

Despite its performance earlier in the year, Tiffany’s earnings shot up in the most recent quarter, which ended Oct. 31, by 52 percent to $119 million, beating out analyst expectations. E-commerce sale were up 92 percent during the quarter.

By October, both parties had reached a truce in order to avoid legal proceedings that would have been harmful on both sides.

Shares of Tiffany & Co. closed up 0.02 percent Wednesday to $131.35 after the news was revealed.

The next question is where LVMH takes Tiffany from here. The American company has a substantial high jewelry business that can go well into the six figures, but also relies heavily on sales of sterling silver pieces by the likes of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso at prices that start at $75 (not counting the $29 deodorant it sells as part of its Tiffany & Love collection). While an instantly recognizable brand worldwide thanks to its blue packaging and Audrey Hepburn and “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” LVMH is expected to push Tiffany even more upmarket and into more expensive offerings.

Speculation has been rife over the future of Tiffany ceo Alessandro Bogliolo as well as the company’s chief artistic officer Reed Krakoff. Sources have said that Anthony Ledru, LVMH’s executive vice president of global commercial activities based in Paris, is among the top candidates to move into the ceo’s job at Tiffany — where he previously worked as vice president of North America. Meanwhile, LVMH ceo Bernard Arnault’s son Alexandre could also take on a role at his father’s newest bauble. Alexandre Arnault, currently ceo of Rimowa, accompanied his father when the luxury titan toured Tiffany for the first time last December, as did his brother Frederic, who in June was named ceo of Tag Heuer."

"LVMH “looking at” resale, Antoine Arnault says - Vogue Business","Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2x2bWgtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctcmVzYWxlLWFudG9pbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1zYXlz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, is looking to enter the secondhand market.

“We are currently studying the subject. It is still a little early to fully answer this question. It's an economy that exists, that's growing in importance, so we're looking at it carefully. We'll probably be able to answer you in a few months,” said Antoine Arnault, LVMH’s head of image, communications and environment.



“It’s something that we’re going to integrate progressively because it’s another way to extend the life of our products. We’re thinking about how we’re going to do it, as there’s still the counterfeiting risk,” LVMH environmental development director Hélène Valade told reporters on Monday, as the conglomerate launched its new sustainability plans.

Resale has been only touched upon lightly by the luxury industry, with tie-ups with peer-to-peer platforms like The RealReal. The lower margins, need for scale and luxury positioning are still relative hurdles for the industry, but the growth of Depop, Vestiaire Collective and Thredup and interest among sustainably minded young consumers makes it appealing. Marco Bizzarri, CEO of Gucci, told Vogue Business the Italian brand was also looking into a large offering in its own stores.



LVMH, the luxury owner of Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, says it will report more regularly on its environmental achievements and progress, with new goals for 2023, 2026 and 2030 focused on a circular economy, biodiversity, climate and transparency. Sustainability is an expectation of job candidates, Arnault said, during the launch of the company’s first Climate Week, an internal initiative designed to promote the company’s sustainability efforts.

“Fashion houses’ permanent collections could travel by sea rather than by air,” Valade added in an interview with Vogue Business. There’s also the goal to reach 100 per cent of its energy from renewable resources by 2030, from 30 per cent in 2020. (LVMH has reached its 2020 goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent and procure 30 per cent of its energy from renewable sources.) And fashion shows aren’t left behind. “Fashion shows must be under control from an environmental point of view,” Valade says.

Recent initiatives include upcycled collections at Loewe and Louis Vuitton and Fendi and Celine’s new manufacturing plants conceived with sustainability in mind. LVMH took a minority stake in Stella McCartney, a label known for its sustainability commitment, whom Arnault singled out for her help.

“She is connected to an ecosystem of startuppers who are very much at the forefront. She likes her ideas to be deployed within the group, she gives them away, it’s open source with her. We are much further ahead than we were, thanks to her since her arrival almost two years ago.”

Valade cited regenerative agriculture that focuses on topsoil regeneration among areas that McCartney helped her to further explore. For example, usage of natural fertilisers for cotton farming in Turkey has a very positive impact on soils and restores the soil’s carbon storage capacity, she explained.

“The most important value of Stella McCartney to LVMH is her significant experience in sustainability,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. “I must imagine they can leverage her experience to cross-fertilise other areas in the group.”

Clarification: This article's headline was updated to show LVMH is ""looking at"" resale, rather than ""considering"" it. More detail has also been added to Mr Arnault's quote in the second paragraph, including that it is ""a little early to fully answer"" the question of offering resale at LVMH. (9/12/20)

LMVH vs. Hermès: A decade of dispute over ownership - TFR,"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdGZyLm5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIwLzExLzMwL3doYXQtd2VudC1kb3duLWJldHdlZW4tbG12aC1hbmQtaGVybWVz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly90ZnIubmV3cy9uZXdzLzIwMjAvMTEvMzAvd2hhdC13ZW50LWRvd24tYmV0d2Vlbi1sbXZoLWFuZC1oZXJtZXM_cmVmPWJlbmNobWFyay5tb25leSZmb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ongoing pandemic doesn’t deter Hermès as the world’s most valuable luxury brand. The resale price of Birkin bag went up during the pandemic. While its reputation remains indisputable, the public might not be aware of its feud with another renowned luxury group that owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Fendi, LVMH.

The feud between both conglomerates was made public a decade ago when LVMH announced it had acquired 14.2% shares in Hermès. LVMH had began acquiring shares in Hermès since 2001 through subsidiaries. In 2002, LVMH owned 4.9% of Hermès.

What went on afterwards was endless legal fight until recently, French financial services watchdog revealed how LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault built considerable amount of stakes in Hermès - through Nicolas Puech.

There are three families controlling 70% of Hermès, the Puech, Dumas and Guerrands. The 42-year-old Axel Dumas in January 2013 succeeded Patrick Thomas as CEO. Nadège Vanhée-Cybulski is currently helming the creative division of the 183-year-old company.

Below is the timeline of legal battle between Hermès and LVMH:

2010

Hermès then-CEO Patrick Thomas found out that LVMH had been secretly accumulating Hermès shares over the years. By 2010, LVMH owned 14.2% of Hermès through its subsidiaries. Once the company converted certain derivative instruments of Hermès, it would own a total of 17.1%.

LVMH bought Hermès shares at an average price of $80.5 per share. Meanwhile, Hermès shares had been publicly traded for $100 and above. There were speculations that LVMH could have purchased the shares from family members or other shareholders.

The move also prompted French financial watchdog Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) to investigate LVMH’s acquisition. Families controlling majority of Hermès set up private holding company and pooled in 50.2% of Hermès shares. It gave them right to refuse any family members from selling their shares.

2011

AMF prohibited LVMH from acquiring Hermès’ shares through minority shareholders. However, LVMH in December told the press it had increased its stake in Hermès from 21% to 22.6%.

2012

Hermès filed complaint against LVMH for secretly building up ownership in Hermès. LVMH had reportedly owned 22.6% shares in Hermès with 16% voting rights. LVMH filed complaint against Hermès for blackmail, slander and unfair competition.

2013

LVMH was fined $13.2 million for not disclosing information regarding the increase of ownership in Hermès to the public. AMF said LVMH should have informed the market in 2008, 2009 and 2010 about its acquisition as it would impact the share prices.

LVMH continued to increase its stake in Hermès from 22.6% to 23.1% - later corrected to 23.2%.

2014

LVMH agreed to distribute 23.2% shares in Hermès to its shareholders and it would not acquire Hermès shares in five years. LVMH, Dior and Groupe Arnault owned 8.5% shares in Hermès after the distribution. The distribution was completed in December.

Groupe Arnault is a principal investment firm owned and controlled by Arnault himself. The firm seeks to hold stake in companies.

Several analyst believed Hermès would have benefited from LVMH, but Axel Dumas argued that both companies had different values and culture. The families would like to keep Hermès as a family-run business.

2017

In April, Groupe Arnault announced that it had swapped the last equity of Hermès to buy out minority shareholders of Christian Dior. Prior to the acquisition, LVMH has already owned Parfums Christian Dior. Groupe Arnault then sold Christian Dior to LVMH.

During the process, the Arnault family also tightened its grip on LVMH, increasing their ownership from 36% to 46%. LVMH reuinted Christian Dior’s perfume and cosmetics divisions with its recently acquired fashion and couture divisions.

2020

AMF revealed that Nicolas Puech was the one who sold Hermès shares to Arnault. According to the investigators, Puech hasn’t owned 5.8% of shares since 2012. Puech’s legal counsel denied the findings, asserting his client never sold 5.8% of his shares in Hermès. His wealth manager, Eric Freymond, is currently under investigation for Puech’s shares disclosure in 2013 and 2014.

When the families behind Hermès created private holding in 2010 to prevent ‘hostile takeover’ from LVMH, Puech was the only one who refused to join the holding. After the dispute was settled in 2014, he stated that Arnault’s investment was not a serious threat to Hermès."
Sustainability Has a Long History at LVMH - Yahoo Life,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktbG9uZy1oaXN0b3J5LWx2bWgtMDUwMTU2MzcyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sustainability can take many forms these days — that includes everything from reducing the carbon footprint and supporting biodiversity to being a good corporate citizen.

That was the message from Antoine Arnault, chief executive officer of Berluti, who also serves as head of image, communications and environment at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the brand’s parent company.

“Sustainability has been part of our top-of-mind topics for the past 25-plus years,” he said. “My father [Bernard Arnault] created the sustainability department at LVMH in 1992.”

And while there is still work to be done, he said the issue has become “ingrained in our values” since that time. “It’s become a way of life for most of our management teams and our designers,” he said, adding that the company seeks to source materials “to forge lasting solutions for climate change.”

But it’s more than that. Arnault said that at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, LVMH set out to do what it could to help. Its cosmetics companies started making hand sanitizer gel and the couture workshops made fabric masks. The group also supported its suppliers who were forced to close their factories by continuing to place large orders and provide cash advances. “It’s not exactly sustainability, but I think, responsibility as a large group is part of this sustainability issue,” he said.

Ditto for the environment, where the company is “focused on providing solutions.” Arnault said LVMH’s customers are demanding that the company tackle the environmental crisis facing the planet, especially Millennials in China and elsewhere. These young people expect the group to show leadership in this area and are “an important means of attracting young talent. Countless times in job interviews, I answer questions around sustainability and I feel my answers are going to make the difference between choosing us or choosing a competitor,” he said.

Case in point is the fact that LVMH has a “relatively low carbon footprint, with only 0.4 percent of the entire global industry,” he said. In addition, the company switched to renewable energy in most of its production sites, has been very strict with lighting management in all of its 2,000 stores around the world, and is working with the delivery services for its e-commerce sites to reduce the carbon footprint.

But LVMH’s main focus today is the “preservation of biodiversity,” Arnault said. “A rich variety of natural resources is essential to our products, which are made from the finest materials, and we feel we have a profound responsibility to give back to nature what she gives to us. We depend on nature, and if climate increases a couple of degrees in the next 25 years, we simply will not be able to make Champagne in Champagne anymore. Let’s be realistic, our economic future depends on the climate change being reduced.”

He said LVMH is working to preserve species and the communities that depend on them and is active with UNESCO in a program called Man and Biosphere to preserve bees and beekeepers around the world. In addition, it supports regenerative agriculture and sources materials grown with fertilizers that strengthen and enrich the soil, and it holds itself and its leather and wool suppliers to the “most rigorous certifications to ensure that biodiversity criteria are taken into account.”

The company is also committed to increasing the circularity of its product range with many of its designers at the forefront of this movement. That includes Stella McCartney, whose entire business model is centered around sustainability, along with Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh, who has been working on recycling, and Jonathan Anderson, who created an entirely eco-designed collection for Loewe. In addition, LVMH’s Innovation Award, which was created in 2017, identifies promising start-ups that support the company’s ethos, and has become an “increasingly coveted award among young designers,” he said.

He concluded: “With all these initiatives, I believe LVMH has found ingredients for a new future and vision for luxury, one that gives equal importance to nature and people, creativity and natural resources.”

LVMH Names Chief Omnichannel Officer Amid New Phase of Digitalization - WWD,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY2hpZWYtb21uaWNoYW5uZWwtb2ZmaWNlci1pYW4tcm9nZXJzLWRpZ2l0YWwtMTIzNDY2NTU0NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moving on to a new phase of its digital transformation, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has tapped two seasoned executives from its flagship fashion brand to lead the charge.

Michael David, currently vice president, client development and digital at Louis Vuitton, is to become chief omnichannel officer for the LVMH group, effective Jan. 20.

Meanwhile, Franck Le Moal will oversee the digital partnerships team in addition to his role as group IT director. Le Moal moved up to the group level in October 2019 after almost 20 years as chief information officer at Vuitton.

The reorganization comes as Ian Rogers, LVMH’s chief digital officer since 2015, transitions into an advisory role at LVMH and takes on a full-time job at tech start-up Ledger in Paris.

“We are very grateful for Ian’s contribution and look forward to continuing to work with him in his advisory role, including hosting the LVMH Innovation Award,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD. “Ian has helped us integrate digital more deeply into our organizations with a sensitivity to the codes of luxury.”

“Michael has led omnichannel at Louis Vuitton to become state of the art in the luxury industry both in terms of revenue growth and excellence of service to customers,” added Toni Belloni, group managing director at LVMH, who oversaw the reorganization of the digital and IT teams. “I am excited for Michael to bring these skills and knowledge to the LVMH digital team and look forward to working with him and Franck to accelerate progress across all the categories and maisons. We have solid digital foundations at LVMH, but this journey is just beginning.”

In an interview on Monday, Belloni recalled that Rogers, who came on board from Apple in 2015, said at the outset that his job was “bound to disappear” once digital know-how became embedded in all parts of LVMH and all functions.

“He has been great at spreading the gospel among our people, and among our leaders, most of them digital non-natives, and also attracting great talent to the group,” Belloni said, also crediting Rogers for “building a web of relationships for the group” with tech giants such as Google, Tencent and Salesforce, along with start-ups like the VivaTech forum in Paris.

“We are happy that he has accepted to stay on as an adviser,” he said. “We’ll be happy to count on his visionary thinking and the fact that he has a very high-level view of what’s happening in the system.”

Meanwhile, the new organizational structure — centered on omnichannel and data — will be charged with “making sure that each brand will have a high-quality, state-of-the-art omnichannel approach,” Belloni said.

He noted that physical stores remain “at the core of our distribution system” alongside each brand having a digital side, including direct-to-consumer touch points and an “infrastructure of remote customer service of high quality.”

Another mission of David’s will be to leverage data, aggregating it and employing artificial intelligence “so that we can delight the customers even more with more personalized curation and service,” Belloni said, while highlighting the importance of client confidentiality.

“Converging to a common technological framework and solutions” is yet another mission. “And there will be a push for innovation where the central organization, which we are calling omnichannel, will continue to work with key maisons to explore projects for smarter clienteling, a hybrid form of commerce, and we’re talking about the use of data for faster, last-mile delivery,” he added.

While Rogers was the public face of its digital ambitions, Belloni said LVMH now has about 50 people in digital working at the group level, another 50 or more within the group level’s “technical infrastructure” and about 600 more at the brands.

“In the end, we want the central group to act as a catalyst, but the maisons need to have their own solutions,” he said.

The goal is to “make sure that we bring the level of desirability and differentiation of our maisons in the virtual world to the same level to what we have built for decades and decades in the physical world. The word ominichannel is not casual — we really believe the two things go together,” Belloni stressed.

Rogers revealed his exit from LVMH in a blog post and podcast Monday morning, noting he will become chief experience officer at Ledger, which protects digital assets such as cryptocurrency.

He is to oversee the “b-to-c business at Ledger including product, marketing and sales. Our job is to make sure Ledger products are not only secure but also easy to use. We also want to educate and help raise the tide to float all boats in the cryptocurrency movement.”

Founded in 2014, Ledger set out to create “secure solutions for blockchain applications” and now has more than 130 employees in Paris, Vierzon, France and San Francisco, according to its web site. It has sold more than 1.5 million digital wallets for cryptocurrencies.

An exuberant executive known to arrive at business meetings on a skateboard wearing the latest hard-to-get Vetements sweatshirt, Rogers joined LVMH in September 2015 from Apple, where he briefly headed up the launch of Apple Music. His mission was to explore new opportunities for the luxury giant in the digital sphere.

Before Apple Music, he was ceo of Beats Music, a maker of high-end headphones, and ceo of Topspin Media. Prior to that, he founded Mediacode, which was purchased by Yahoo, where he became vice president and general manager of music. Rogers has also served as a web master for Nullsoft and Beastie Boys.

Recapping his accomplishments in his blog post, Rogers said the “luxury business itself hasn’t changed, but the ways we create awareness and sell are changing dramatically, so at LVMH we have made many adaptations.”

“When I joined LVMH, there was disagreement on strategies regarding online distribution which have since been rationalized, agreed upon, and are being executed. We have started to build a practice around data and artificial intelligence, which I believe will drive customer satisfaction, reduce waste and drive sales in the coming years,” he added.

LVMH has grown e-commerce to account for about 15 percent of revenues, with selective distribution and perfumes and cosmetics division more than 20 percent, according to Belloni.

Under the new digital organization, David and Le Moal report to Belloni; the digital team and the customer care organization to David; Olivier Le Garlantezec and the partnerships team to Le Moal. Wendy Chan, head of digital in Asia-Pacific, will add local media oversight to her scope and report to David, LVMH noted.

"Yearbook: LVMH Vs. Tiffany – Off Again, On Again Luxury Dealmaking - WWD","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWZlYXR1cmVzL2x2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tcm9nZXItZmFyYWgtMTIzNDY4MTM0MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Even in the midst of a global pandemic, love can prevail — especially with a little nudge from the Delaware Chancery Court and a 2.6 percent price cut.

So it was with Tiffany & Co. and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a pair that came into the year happily engaged after a whirlwind romance. The French giant pursued and ultimately persuaded the jeweler to accept a buyout at $135 a share, or $16.2 billion, when the deal was signed in November 2019.

Tiffany marks the largest luxury deal in Arnault’s long and storied career of high-end consolidation.

When Tiffany shareholders signed off on the transaction in February, LVMH chief executive officer Bernard Arnault trumpeted the milestone even as the coronavirus pandemic had already chilled business in China.

“A globally recognized symbol of love, Tiffany will be an outstanding addition to our unique portfolio of luxury brands,” Arnault said. “We look forward to welcoming Tiffany into the LVMH family.”

That warm embrace cooled considerably as the pandemic spread from China to Europe to the U.S. — shutting stores, cutting off travel and forcing an emphasis on essential retailers and necessities.

While neither side outwardly portrayed doubts about the deal as both Tiffany and LVMH scrambled to adjust to the new world, concerns were growing on both sides.

Tiffany worried over LVMH’s efforts to get regulators around the world to sign off on the deal and LVMH looked aghast at the jeweler, which continued its long practice of paying dividends despite the suddenly horrid economy.

In June, WWD broke the news that LVMH was getting cold feet. The firm’s board met in Paris to discuss the deal, voicing concerns about both the pandemic and growing social unrest following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

By September, LVMH was walking away.

In a twist, the luxury giant said it couldn’t go ahead with the deal because of a letter from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, which it described as an order to hold off on the deal given a separate trade spat between Paris and Washington, D.C.

But that order started seeming less certain, and Le Drian later told the French parliament that: “My role is to apply, whenever appropriate, the government’s opinion on an assessment of a political nature regarding the management of major international events to come. That is the reason why I replied to a question from the LVMH group, totally in my role.”

That injected a bit of unexpected political intrigue, with the suggestion that LVMH, and Arnault, used its political clout to enlist the French government’s help to get out of the deal lingering. But it was the nuances of the contract that became the primary focus of a bruising court battle.

And as court battles go, it didn’t disappoint, with Tiffany chairman Roger Farah pushing hard to keep the deal he negotiated and LVMH pushing back just as hard.

The rhetoric ranged well beyond the legalese of the contract dispute with many zingers, including:

• Farah: “As we are not aware of any other French company receiving such a [governmental] request, it is all the more clear that LVMH has unclean hands.”

• Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH chief financial officer, to a reporter: “You must be joking. Are you seriously suggesting that we procured the letter? I don’t even want to answer that question. [The letter from the French government] was fully unsolicited.”

• Farah: “LVMH’s shifting explanations indicate bad faith in its dealings with Tiffany and are nothing more than distractions meant to hide its efforts to run out the clock and avoid fulfilling its obligations.”

• LVMH: “The business LVMH proposed to acquire in November 2019 — Tiffany & Co., a consistently highly profitable luxury retail brand — no longer exists. What remains is a mismanaged business that over the first half of 2020 hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight.”

But once the regulatory approvals finally rolled in, the trial was set for early January and the potentially messy depositions were just about to start, tensions eased and the two sides started talking again.

The result after nearly two months of open warfare was a new deal at $131.50 a share, or $16 billion, with the understanding that Tiffany would continue to pay dividends until the transaction closes.

Ultimately, the coming to terms had a little bit for everyone, LVMH got a bit of a price cut, Tiffany can move on and neither side had to risk a Delaware judge compelling them to do anything.

“This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details,” Arnault said. “We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

The focus is now on what that next chapter looks like and many expect any bad blood from the dispute to dissipate as LVMH starts to put its imprint on the business with its decidedly long-term approach.



Sources expect Tiffany ceo Alessandro Bogliolo to exit the business while LVMH sticks to its practice of promoting from within its vast empire of high-end brands for a new leader of the American jeweler.

Bogliolo came into Tiffany in 2017 with a plan to drive growth in China and through omnichannel initiatives while also raising average unit retail prices and accelerating product innovation.

“These four engines of growth, it took really three years to put together,” Bogliolo said. “I think they have been really stress tested in [the third] quarter. Three years down the road here, we are in a difficult quarter and the four engines all worked very well.”

Net earnings for the three months ended Oct. 31 jumped 52 percent over a year earlier to $119 million and were far better than analysts projected. Excluding $16.5 million in costs related to the merger with LVMH, Tiffany’s earnings advanced 73 percent to $136 million.

The ceo said Tiffany has been growing closer to many of its customers despite the pandemic.

“We equipped the sales professionals to connect with the customer even if the store was closed,” he said. “It was not selling, it was just to connect with regular, loyal customers in a difficult moment. That was enormously appreciated by the customer. And then it became a new habit, a new normal in which it has become OK for sales professionals to interact with customers, to reach out to them by text, by phone, by social media.”

Bogliolo’s partner in the company’s progress has been chief artistic director Reed Krakoff who has reimagined and expanded the jeweler’s signature “T” collection, introduced The Blue Box Café, added three distinct high-jewelry collections, and introduced Tiffany Paper Flowers, which runs from fine to high jewelry. It remains to be seen, though, if that is enough for LVMH and whether it will keep Krakoff onboard or taps another high-profile designer.



Overall, observers see Tiffany flourishing under LVMH.

“LVMH is a master at selling perceived exclusivity to the masses,” said Luca Solca, senior research analyst, global luxury goods at Bernstein, when the new deal was closed. “This, I expect, will be the most important contribution that LVMH can bring to Tiffany.”

If on December 1st the French multinational announced the resignation of Ian Rogers, Chief Digital Officer of the group since 2015, the following day its managerial mosaic changed shape again. And it brings news, above all, in the stylistic context of LVMH reference brand. In other words, Louis Vuitton. In particular, in his men’s leather goods collections. Here, alongside Virgil Abloh, comes Darren Spaziani from Women’s collections. But LVMH risk does not end there.

Darren Spaziani

Spaziani (in the box), an American designer, will soon take care of the men’s leather goods collections for Louis Vuitton. We write “also”, because Spaziani, since 2013, coordinates the same creative direction of the brand, but for women. All this, having already worked for Vuitton between 2004 and 2006. “Darren has brought his creative vision to women’s leather goods – explains executive vice president of the brand, Delphine Arnault to WWD -. He knows how to perfectly infuse modernity by relying on craftsmanship and talented teams”.

Creative interactions

Thus, if for Vuitton women’s collections he is interacting with creative director Nicolas Ghesquière, for the Man he will be collaborating with Virgil Abloh. “I am very honoured to be able to explore new creative territories, and look forward to working with Abloh and his team,” Spaziani told wwd.com.

LVMH Risk

LVMH risk does not end there. The transalpine giant, in fact, has appointed Chris de Lapuente as president and CEO of the Selective Retailing Division. Who, since 2011, has held the same position in another brand of the group: Sephora.

LVMH Says Tiffany Acquisition Due to Close on Jan. 7 - WWD,"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtc2F5cy10aWZmYW55LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWR1ZS10by1jbG9zZS1vbi1qYW4tMTIzNDY4ODI4OC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said Thursday its acquisition of Tiffany & Co. is expected to close on Jan. 7, after Tiffany shareholders overwhelmingly approved the updated agreement for the French luxury conglomerate to buy the storied American jeweler for a reduced price.

The deal replaces the original November 2019 agreement with a $131.50 in cash per share purchase price, compared with the original offer of $135 a share. That equals about $420 million in savings for LVMH. The parties also agreed to settle pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court. The final purchase price is $15.8 billion.

After the deal is complete, Tiffany will no longer be a public company, but an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of parent company LVMH, thus joining a stable of luxury brands that includes Dior, Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Givenchy and Berluti, not to mention jewelers Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred.

The agreement caps a turbulent engagement that saw LVMH strike an agreement to buy Tiffany for a record $16.2 billion, but appear to get cold feet after the coronavirus crisis hit. In September, the group said it was walking away from the deal, triggering a lawsuit by Tiffany.

By October, both parties had reached a truce in order to avoid legal proceedings that would have been harmful on both sides.

"12 VENDÔME, AN EXQUISITE JEWEL CASE FOR MAISON CHAUMET - LVMH","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 09:26:27 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx2bWguY29tL25ld3MtZm9sZGVycy8xMi12ZW5kb21lLWFuLWV4cXVpc2l0ZS1qZXdlbC1jYXNlLWZvci1tYWlzb24tY2hhdW1ldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"1780-2020. Chaumet has written its exceptional history century after century, an uninterrupted 240-year saga of the first jeweler to take up residence at one of the most famous addresses in the world, Place Vendôme in Paris. To celebrate this anniversary and restore the splendor of the Baudard de Sainte-James hôtel particulier, the world-renowned jewelry house has completely renovated its prestigious flagship. Join us for a private tour of 12 Vendôme.

In 1777, Claude Baudard de Sainte-James, the treasurer of the French navy, laid claim to No. 12, a prime location in the middle with a 180 degree view of the square. He chose the best craftsmen from the court of Versailles to build his private residence. In 1779, the architect François-Joseph Bélanger, who had built the Château de Bagatelle in just two months, applied his innovative vision to the interior layout of the salons, creating a festive space that was at the same time sumptuously stunning and elegantly refined. The woodwork was crafted by the Rousseau brothers who, in tribute to the owner, decorated the doors with shells, anchors, tridents and dolphins sculpted in fine gold. The painter Jean-Jacques Lagrenée Le Jeune reprised the marine theme in oval canvases featuring Neptune and Ocean. What would soon become home to Chaumet was at last ready to welcome life, unveiling an energy and elegance that would thrive over the centuries.

If Paris has two souls – that of Louis XIV and that of Napoleon – Place Vendôme is their metempsychosis, infused with the dual heritage of the Sun King’s classicism and Napoléon’s imperial glory. Between 1685 and 1699, at the recommendation of his finance minister Louvois, Louis XIV decided to create this open yet protected square at the center of power in Paris under the Ancien Régime. The architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, designed an octagonal shape measuring 213 meters in length and 124 meters in width featuring elegantly simple architecture, not unlike the exquisite cut of an emerald with beveled corners. Around the square his plans called for 28 hôtels particuliers – private mansions with perfect proportions and alignment.

During this same period, in 1780 Marie-Étienne Nitot, an apprentice to the king’s jeweler Ange-Joseph Aubert, created his own jewelry house, Chaumet, writing he first chapter in the story of a Maison that continues to flourish nearly two and a half centuries later. Chaumet went through the French Revolution, the fall of the Ancien Régime and the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire, before entering history when Napoléon called on the Maison to make the jewels for his coronation, including the imperial sword set with the famous Golconde Regent diamond. Napoléon also had Chaumet craft the many gifts expressing his love of Joséphine, to whom Nitot became official jeweler. Over the years, Chaumet made both ceremonial and personal jewels for her, encoded with messages and symbols of the passion between Joséphine and Bonaparte. His creations revealed the many facets of the personality of a woman who was both passionately in love and an empress.

Following his victory at Austerlitz, Napoleon chose Place Vendôme to erect a monumental column celebrating the victorious army, made using the 1,250 cannons captured from the Russians and Prussians during the 1805 campaign, and decorated with bronze bas-reliefs that recount the emperor’s illustrious victories, spiraling 40 meters to the top. The Place Vendôme was also the first place in the world to install gas streetlamps, earning Paris the sobriquet “City of Light” when they were first lit in 1829.

Over the years, the remarkable history of this aptly named hôtel particulier included festivities that added to its legend. In 1848 it was home to the Russian embassy. Frédéric Chopin resided there at the time at the invitation of his friend the Countess Potocka. Shortly before he passed away on October 17, 1849, he composed his final mazurka in the grand salon – which was placed on France’s national heritage list in 1927. In homage to the celebrated composer, Pierre-Victor Galland painted an allegory to music on the ceiling in 1864 representing the muse Euterpe. This is also where the young Eugénie de Montijo took up residence in 1851, beginning a romance with the future Napoléon III, who lived a few doors down at No. 6. The new imperial couple chose Chaumet to make many sentimental jewels – including their wedding rings – all carefully documented in the Chaumet archives. The jeweler moved from the Hôtel Gramont at 15 Place Vendôme, which the Nitot family had acquired in 1811 – and which has been the Hôtel Ritz since 1897 – to rue Richelieu, before finally settling into its permanent home at No. 12 Place Vendôme in 1907, under Joseph Chaumet. It was here in these exceptional contemporary premises that he decided to bring together a boutique, a workshop and a photo lab to document each creation.

A palimpsest of French history where power and luxury rub shoulders with art de vivre and culture, 12 Vendôme quickly came to embody all that is most precious in Paris in the eyes of the world."
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton : Italy's Moncler adds Stone Island to collection in $1.4 billion deal - Marketscreener.com,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXRzY3JlZW5lci5jb20vcXVvdGUvc3RvY2svTFZNSC00NjY5L25ld3MvTFZNSC1Nb2V0LUhlbm5lc3N5LUxvdWlzLVZ1aXR0b24tSXRhbHktcy1Nb25jbGVyLWFkZHMtU3RvbmUtSXNsYW5kLXRvLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24taW4tMS00LWJpbGxpb24tMzE5NTYzNjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN (Reuters) - Down jacket maker Moncler is buying smaller Italian high-end streetwear and fashion brand Stone Island in a 1.15 billion euro ($1.4 billion) deal which could signal an intention to consolidate rather than be acquired.

Moncler, which has become a luxury industry darling in recent years after a makeover under Chief Executive Remo Ruffini, has long been regarded by the market as a potential takeover target by large overseas players.

And as high-end brands have come under intense pressure with the crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic decimating demand and exposing the sector's reliance on Chinese tourists, they are being forced to find new ways to gain customers.

""It is the right moment, because at such a difficult time it underscores the resilience of Italy,"" Moncler Chief Executive Remo Ruffini told a call with analysts on Monday.

A person close to the deal said it could mark the first step towards the creation of an Italian luxury hub in an industry dominated by French luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering, which have snapped up a string of family-owned Italian labels in recent years.

Monday's share-and-cash acquisition of Stone Island, Moncler's first-ever purchase, was seen by Bernstein analyst Luca Solca as a ""Chapter 2"" for the puff jacket maker, heralding the possible creation of a multi-brand group.

The Moncler brand was created in 1952 in a village in the mountains near Grenoble, focusing on highland sports clothing. Ruffini bought the then-struggling label in 2003 and transformed its puffer jackets into luxury status symbols.

Moncler, which Ruffini listed in 2013, has a market value of 11 billion euros and last year had sales of 1.6 billion euros, before a big downturn caused by the pandemic.

Stone Island's high-end streetwear and sporty style is popular with generation Z shoppers who are seen driving future growth in the luxury sector. It is known in Italy and Europe but lacks a presence in the key Chinese market and in the United States.

Chinese consumers are forecast to account for almost half of global luxury goods purchases by 2025.

The label, which has a lower entry point than Moncler, has seen double-digit revenue growth in recent years and expects a 1% rise in sales to almost 240 million euros in 2020 - no small feat in a year when global luxury goods sales are expected to fall by 23% on average.

""It reminds me a lot of what Moncler was 10 years ago, I believe it has great potential to grow,"" said Ruffini, who aims to double Stone Island's sales in 5 years.

Shares in Moncler were up 4% in Milan at 1220 GMT after the announcement of the agreement, which will see Moncler buy just over 50% of outerwear brand Stone Island from owner and CEO Carlo Rivetti and a further 19.9% from other family members.

Moncler will pay half in cash and half in its own shares for Stone Island, giving the Rivetti family 10.7 million new Moncler shares at a set price of 37.51 euros per share.

It then aims to buy the remaining 30% held by Singapore's state investor Temasek, which owns a small stake in Moncler.

The deal is expected to close by the first half of 2021.

Moncler was advised by Citi and Stone Island by Rothschild.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together,” Rihanna told Business of Fashion.

Fenty Maison will be the first fashion label created from the ground up at LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987. This venture also makes Rihanna the first Black woman to create an original brand with LVMH. Following the success of Fenty Beauty, which partnered with Kendo (an LVMH beauty incubator) it only makes sense that the fashion conglomerate would want in on all things Fenty. If Rihanna’s spirit of innovation, diversity, and inclusion that permeate her beauty and lingerie lines are any indication, then we are in for a real treat with the first Black-owned luxury fashion house, Fenty Maison."

Dominique Muret Translated by

Nicola Mira Published

Dec 10, 2020

On the occasion of 2020 Climate Action Day and of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the group has once again highlighted its commitment to sustainability.



The French luxury group is staging LVMH Climate Week, an event running from December 8 to 11 which brings virtually together the group’s 163,000 employees. It features a series of conferences aimed at mobilising the whole group as it deals with the challenges of climate change, and to share best practices in the area of carbon emission cutting.



A way of “building together the group's climate strategy involving both junior and senior employees.” And also, the occasion for unveiling some of the group’s new goals via the ‘Life 360’ environmental programme.







Guerlain is participating in a UNESCO bee-protection programme - LVMH



LVMH will feature some of the event's content and conferences on its site during this week, which opened on Tuesday in the presence among others of former French PM Laurent Fabius, who also chaired the COP21 summit, and French palaeontologist Valérie Masson-Delmotte.



In the course of the week, LVMH will notably present 49 innovative solutions. In a video-conference on Monday, the group outlined the main elements of its new road map for sustainable development and environmental performance.

Hélène Valade, appointed at the start of 2020 as the group’s environmental development director, underlined that “the planet is lagging behind the objectives set at the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Scientists are urging us to accelerate in this direction, and LVMH is taking these issues extremely seriously.”



In the last five years, the world's number one luxury group has cut the emissions caused by its energy consumption by 25%, and its labels have introduced a multiplicity of environmental protection initiatives. But LVMH wants to go even farther.



The group's Life 2020 programme, drawn up in 2016, has reached nearly all its objectives, and has been replaced by Life 360, with deadlines set at three, six and 10 years (in 2023, 2026 and 2030). The new programme’s targets are ambitious and, besides climate action, they also include safeguarding biodiversity, regarded as the industry's next major challenge.



Driven by eco-fashion pioneer , who joined LVMH in 2019 as special adviser on sustainable development issues, the group will introduce a series of pilot projects in regenerative agriculture. Among them, one for growing cotton in Turkey using 100% organic fertilisers, which improve soil yield and increase its capacity to store carbon dioxide.







The LVMH group's carbon footprint audit - LVMH



LVMH, a world leader with its 75 luxury labels, is responsible for 0.5% of the CO2 emissions caused by the textile industry globally. Until now, the group has taken into account the carbon emissions in the categories defined as Scope 1 (the group's direct emissions) and Scope 2 (the greenhouse gas emissions directly linked to product manufacturing).



With Life 360, LVMH wants to refine the measurements by adding Scope 3 goals (relating to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to other phases of the product life cycle, such as sourcing and transportation).



In other words, the group is now going to intervene on its suppliers’ CO2 emissions. “This means a huge effort with our suppliers, which number in the tens of thousands. It will not be easy, but we must do it, since we want to follow the milestones set by the Paris agreement,” said Valade.



This means cutting emissions to the bare bones, and compensating any that still remain. The new objectives set by the group include using 100% renewable energy in its factories by 2030, using 100% LED lighting in its stores by 2023, and eliminating plastic from packaging by 2026.



“We wish to promote a new luxury (luxe nouveau), like the Art Nouveau artistic movement that emerged at the end of the 19th century, which put nature at the heart of art. It's a new vision of luxury, aiming at allying our creativity and skills with the world of plants and animals, the living soil and all its precious resources. All of our products share a connection with living nature. Artistic genius must therefore have the same importance as the genius of nature. We must give back to nature what we have taken away from it,” said Valade, underlining also how “this vision and this alliance are embodied in the Life 360 programme.”



A vision that requires “more stringent, more robust standards” of supply chain certification, as well as a new assessment of the length of products’ life cycle - LVMH is taking a close look at the new business model of second-hand fashion, while and Louis Vuitton both offer a repair service - and a rethinking of the way goods are transported. For example, and Louis Vuitton are restructuring their logistics organisation in order to be able to ship their permanent collections’ items by sea and no longer by air.







The four pillars of LVMH’s Life 360 programme - LVMH



The group has also worked a great deal on “timing, the relationship with time, notably addressing the issue of catwalk shows,” which in future are likely to be less frequent and increasingly hybridised, featuring digital elements. Clearly, travelling to Rio in Brazil for a 15-minute show, as Louis Vuitton did in 2016 for the cruise collection, is no longer on the cards.



Asked about the role of activists, Valade replied that “their warnings are useful, but we need dialogue. [Dialogue] is extremely important to enable everyone to move forward. We all need to modify our stance. Sometimes, with certain activists, this is difficult.” Asked about the recent cull of farm-bred in Denmark, Valade indicated that LVMH sources its mink fur in Finland.



“Our labels are free to choose their materials, provided animal well-being criteria in the supply chain are complied with. This is non-negotiable,” said Valade, adding that “we mustn't forget about the eco-system these animal breeding farms represent employment-wise. We must strike the right balance between animal well-being, environmental protection and social equity.”



“Nearly 90% of the questions job applicants ask us relate to sustainability and ethics issues,” said , general manager of Berluti and image and environment director at LVMH. “We owe it to ourselves to be up to the challenge. More prosaically, it's also a matter of protecting our business. If we don’t act quickly and decisively against global warming, it will be a catastrophe for our wine producers. This is why everyone must be involved in this effort. Starting from designers, who must become master craftsmen of eco-designed products,” concluded Arnault."

In addition, as part of this agreement Moët Hennessy has acquired a minority stake in WhistlePig. The partnership and minority investment will have no impact on WhistlePig’s distribution partnerships in North America and is focused on building WhistlePig and the brand outside of North America.

U.S. jeweler Tiffany's shareholders on Wednesday approved a $15.8 billion deal with France's LVMH , ending an acrimonious dispute between the two luxury retailers that had stretched for more than a year.

At a virtual special stockholder meeting, more than 99% of votes cast were in favor of the deal.

Billionaire Bernard Arnault-led LVMH made the first offer late last year, but as the luxury industry slipped into a turmoil due to the Covid-19 pandemic the company backed out from its promise to close the deal.

LVMH also cited French political intervention to delay completing the acquisition until Jan. 6, pushing Tiffany into a legal battle in September to force LVMH to honor the deal.

Tiffany had earlier said its sales were improving, citing demand recovery in the United States ahead of the holiday season and China, one of its biggest markets.

LVMH then renegotiated the deal price, lowering it by $425 million. The deal, now cleared by regulators, is expected to close in early 2021.

As agreed in October, LVMH will pay $131.5 per share, down from $135 in the original deal signed late last year."

PETA Shuts Down LV's 'Humanely Farmed' Claims - PETA,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnL2Jsb2cvcGV0YS1wdXRzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb24tYmxhc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"December 7, 2020 by Michelle Feinberg Last Updated December 9, 2020.

In response to Louis Vuitton’s statements that 100% of the animals used for the company’s products are “humanely farmed,” PETA has one major question: How in the world could the exotic-skins industry—in which workers sometimes skin crocodiles alive and stun ostriches with electricity before slitting their throats—be considered humane?

Workers in Vietnam cut off crocodiles’ skin to make “luxury” leather bags.

The answer: It isn’t. In a letter to Michael Burke, the CEO of Louis Vuitton, PETA pushed back against his recent claims that the company uses humanely sourced materials: “Despite this assurance to consumers, there is no such thing as ‘humanely farmed’ animals who are violently killed and skinned for Louis Vuitton products.”

No matter how animals are killed, there is no humane way to exploit them for their skins. A PETA video exposé of a Vietnam crocodile farm that has supplied skins to LVMH (the parent company of Louis Vuitton) showed crocodiles packed into concrete enclosures, some narrower than the length of their bodies. At another farm, crocodiles were packed into small, filthy concrete pits with other reptiles, exposing them to injury, disease, and aggression—one crocodile was even missing a tail.

Another PETA investigation into the largest ostrich slaughter companies in the world—including Klein Karoo International, which supplied ostrich leather to Louis Vuitton—revealed workers striking ostriches in the face during transport, forcibly restraining them, pushing them into stun boxes, and slitting their throats in front of others slated for a similar fate.

In addition, LVMH has yet to join the long list of designers that have gone fur-free, even though multiple investigations into the fur industry have revealed cruelty across the board.

No animal should be used for clothing or accessories under any circumstances, but these horrifying conditions are standard. Jared Goodman, the PETA Foundation’s vice president and deputy general counsel for animal law, made it clear in the letter that no matter how far the company goes to “humane-wash” its products, the skins industry is still harming and exploiting animals:

As described in the attached report that was provided to LVMH in 2016, this cruelty is standard wherever animals are killed for human use. And PETA’s investigations into the wool, down, and leather industries have revealed time and again that it is nothing but wishful thinking that certifications—which neither Louis Vuitton nor LVMH even require for all suppliers in their chain—somehow prevent egregious harm.

Crocodiles are magnificent animals who can live to be 80 years old in their natural habitat, where they enjoy playing and digging tunnels. They don’t belong in concrete pits, on cutting tables, or in accessories—no animal does.

Dozens of major designers and retailers, including Calvin Klein, Chanel, Nordstrom, and Selfridges, have removed exotic skins from their products. PETA will continue to put the pressure on LVMH executives until they get the memo that animals are not ours to exploit for handbags, clothing, or anything else."
Bernard Arnault Named 'Manager of the Decade' in TV Awards - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbmFtZWQtbWFuYWdlci1kZWNhZGUtMDk1ODU4MzQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS– Just a week after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s market capitalization hit 250 billion euros, a record on the Paris Stock Exchange, the head of the luxury group has been named “Manager of the Decade” by French business news channel BFM Business.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, accepted the award during an evening program on Monday flanked by guests including French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

BFM Business noted that during the last decade, LVMH has tripled sales and quadrupled profits, but Arnault insisted that profits were not a goal.

“So the market capitalization, which depends partly on the offer and demand at any given time and how the stock market is performing, is an indicator, a consequence, but it must not be an objective,” he said.

The executive had warned for the last few years that a major economic crisis was looming. “No one listened to me, not even my colleagues within the group, and this crisis came about. What I had absolutely not anticipated was that it would be a health crisis,” he said.

He noted that governments had managed the situation better than the last major global economic meltdown in 2008, when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers almost triggered a collapse of the worldwide banking system. “Today, we are in a different situation,” Arnault said. “We spent a lot of money, but we never came close to a real [economic] catastrophe.”

In a follow-up interview broadcast on Tuesday morning, he noted that LVMH’s global network of almost 5,000 stores had allowed it to absorb the shock better than smaller competitors. With 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Guerlain and Sephora, it is the world’s biggest luxury group.

“I don’t want to seem pretentious, but it’s true that a group like ours emerges stronger from a crisis because its economic weight allows it to weather these difficult moments better than others,” Arnault said, noting that LVMH has been able to continue investing in advertising.

“Europe is the zone that is suffering the most right now, but at the same time, China has bounced back in a surprising way; Japan is faring quite well with relatively few deaths, and an economy that is stable; and the situation in the United States is worrying on the health front, but on the economic side, for the time being – I don’t know what the new president is going to do – it seems to be doing well,” Arnault said.

Asked whether LVMH plans further acquisitions following its purchase of U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., Arnault merely replied: “I am a dreamer by nature.”

He and Le Maire did not comment on the circumstances of the acquisition, which LVMH at one point threatened to call off, citing a French government request to defer the transaction due to a U.S. threat to slap tariffs on a range of French products. Since LVMH and Tiffany made up in late October, LVMH has made no further mention of the French government letter that purportedly jeopardized the deal.

The administration of President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on $1.3 billion worth of French goods, including cosmetics, soap and handbags, in retaliation for a French tax on American technology companies. Le Maire reiterated on Monday that France intends to tax digital giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook this year, noting that their market capitalizations frequently exceeds $1 trillion, four times that of LVMH.

“Since tax returns are confidential, I won’t compare the taxes paid by LVMH and those paid by digital giants, but it will come as no surprise that those with a lower market capitalization pay more taxes than those with a higher market capitalization. This is one of the injustices we want to correct by taxing those that make profits without creating material goods,” he said.

Le Maire said the French economy, which is forecast to contract by 11 percent this year as a result of two lockdowns designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, should recover quickly next year. “France will see a sharp rebound in 2021. We saw in the third quarter that as soon as the lockdown measures are lifted, a very strong recovery is possible,” he said.

Arnault concurred. “If we manage to stem this health crisis, France will see an extraordinary recovery,” he said."

The online awards saw Cipriani recognised for his lifetime of service to the luxury hospitality sector alongside another top executive, Brian Duffy, CEO of Watches of Switzerland.

Duffy’s Lifetime Achievement Award recognised a career in luxury that most recently saw him oversee last year’s listing of Watches of Switzerland following its expansion into the US.

Also recognised, as winner of the Luxury Law Department award, was the LVMH Americas legal team led by Louise Firestone, while Melissa Roth, Burberry’s US-based global vice president of brand protection, won Luxury Corporate Counsel.

This year’s rising star, meanwhile, was Derek Morales, senior director, IP counsel, at Ralph Lauren while the Luxury Business Leader award went to Ulrik Garde Due, chief executive of heritage US leather goods brand Mark Cross.

Garde Due said the Covid-19 pandemic was accelerating the digitalisation of the sector prompting Mark Cross to enhance a digital-first strategy that was already on its roadmap.

He added that consumers were also demanding increased transparency amid “a growing antipathy towards waste”.

Firestone also reflected on the impact of coronavirus, praising her team for adapting quickly to remote working.

""We had to think of new ways to collaborate and share information because in the early days especially information was critical,"" she said, adding: ""The resilience and persistence that the team has shown during these many months has been incredible.""

Meanwhile, speaking from his home city of Venice, Cipriani said he had been adapting Harry’s Bar to accommodate Covid-19 restrictions and hoped once the pandemic was over there would be a sense of excitement reminiscent of the 1950s.

“In the 50s, at the end of the war, everybody wanted to come out from themselves and do something with great happiness,” he said. “I am doing everything I can to make it happen.”

The awards took place at the end of the day-long Luxury Law Summit Americas, now in its third year, but taking place online for the first time.

Speakers included The New York Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, co-chair Barbara Kolsun, director of The FAME Center and professor of practice at Cardozo Law School, and Shane St. Hill, global director of legal at Godiva Chocolatier.

Top brands represented at the summit included, Amazon, eBay, SENTALER, David Yurman, Chanel, Christian Dior, L’Oreal, Vince Holding, PVH, Coty and Kering.

"PETA is Threatening to Sue Louis Vuitton Over ""Humanely Farmed"" Animal Claims - The Fashion Law","Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3BldGEtaXMtdGhyZWF0ZW5pbmctdG8tc3VlLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3Zlci1odW1hbmVseS1mYXJtZWQtYW5pbWFsLWNsYWltcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is threatening Louis Vuitton with a lawsuit over allegedly “false claims” that the company’s chairman and CEO made in an interview in September. According to a letter addressed to Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO Michael Burke on Monday, legal counsel for the animal rights group “demands” that Burke “immediately end [his] false representations that the animals used for Louis Vuitton products ‘are humanely farmed.’” Such comments amount to “fraud,” PETA Foundation deputy general counsel Jared Goodman asserts, citing a potential “consumer fraud action” against the luxury goods company as a result.

In the letter, which was seen by TFL on Monday, Goodman points to comments that Mr. Burke made in a September 19 interview with British publication, The Telegraph, in which he stated, “I can say 100 percent hand on heart our animals are humanely farmed.” PETA’s counsel claims that “this assurance to consumers” is without merit, as “there is no such thing as ‘humanely farmed’ animals, who are violently killed and skinned for Louis Vuitton products.” (PETA does not state in its letter whether a standard for “humane farming” exists, and if so, what that standard entails.)

Goodman continues on in the brief letter, stating, “As you no doubt know, PETA has exposed the cruelty of the exotic-skins industry, including within LVMH’s supply chain.” For instance, he cites “a PETA-affiliate exposé into Vietnam crocodile farms, [which] shows tens of thousands of crocodiles in small, concrete enclosures – some narrower than the length of their bodies. The investigator was told the animals were kept there for over a year.”

PETA’s counsel asserts that Burke and the Louis Vuitton brand “can easily rectify this by removing all exotic skins from your offerings immediately, just as major designers, including Calvin Klein and Chanel, and retailers, such as Nordstrom and Selfridges, have already done.” He states that PETA hopes that Burke “will recognize your untenable position and, at the least, immediately cease making this and any other false claims to misrepresent the suffering inherent in your company’s supply chain.”

This is hardly PETA’s first attack on Louis Vuitton, nor it is the group’s first threat of litigation. In early 2016, PETA announced that it had acquired a single share in Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in furtherance of its quest to gain access to LVMH’s shareholder meetings to pressure the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate to stop using alligator and crocodile skins in its products.

A squabble erupted between the two entities when PETA claimed in the spring of 2017 that it was denied entrance to an LVMH shareholder meeting after announcing that one of its representatives planned to attend the meeting in order to inquire about LVMH’s reliance on Vietnam crocodile farms – including two that supplied skins to a tannery owned by LVMH – which were allegedly subjecting animals to an array of abuses, as well as its use (and alleged abuse) of ostrich skins for its pricey products.

On the heels of the meeting, PETA alleged that its “representative was refused entrance to the main meeting room and denied the opportunity to ask board members a question about the company’s appalling use of exotic-animal skins.” While the exact rights of shareholders tend to vary by company and in accordance with the size and nature of each party’s stake, PETA argued that its acquisition of a single share in LVMH in January 2016 ensured it entrance to the Paris-based conglomerate’s annual shareholder meetings. After being excluded from the April 2017 meeting, PETA told TFL that it was exploring potential legal action. No formal litigation between PETA and LVMH has followed.

Should PETA decide to initiate legal action against Louis Vuitton, it would not be the first plaintiff to file suit on the basis of allegedly misleading animal treatment claims. Although, it might be the first to do so in a fashion context.

Courts in the U.S. have been facing a growing number of filings over companies’ claims about their treatment of animals, namely in the context of food. As Sheppard Mullin’s Abby Meyer stated in August 2019, “A handful of class actions have been filed challenging label claims regarding the treatment of the animals.” In one such case, a class of plaintiffs filed suit against Pete and Gerry’s Organics, LLC and Nellie’s Free Range Eggs in March 2019, alleging that the defendants’ advertisements and product labels falsely represented that their eggs were sourced from humanely-treated hens.

The companies’ “product labels depicted open grass fields, a little girl holding a hen, and phrases including ‘they roam where they please,’” Meyer stated. “A website link further depicted hens in large grass fields and distinguished the defendants’ farms from typical hen farms.” The plaintiffs, who set forth claims of common law fraud and breach of express warranty, took issue with such representations, asserting that “contrary to the label claims, the defendants ‘cram[] and stuff[] hens … into sheds up to 20,000 at a time,’” thereby, misleading consumers by way of their allegedly false marketing messaging.

Fast forward to May 2020 and the parties agreed to confidentially settle the case. However, a number of other, similar animal-specific cases – which have been filed largely on state consumer fraud grounds – are currently underway in various courts across the U.S., and are “consistent with the overall trend of attacking representations made on labels and in advertising,” per Meyer.

“In recent years, animal rights groups have focused their litigation efforts on companies that they perceive are popular with consumers and are delivering messages to consumers about positive animal welfare, environmental stewardship and the production of ethically-sourced products,” according to Duane Morris’ Michelle C. Pardo. “Animal rights groups view this type of labeling and marketing as a threat to their mission. If consumers feel good about the products that they buy, they are less likely to abandon meat, dairy and other products” – including exotic-skinned luxury handbags – “that are eschewed by many animal rights activists.”

A rep for Louis Vuitton was not immediately available for comment."

Dior Learned To Localize In China - And Was Rewarded For It - Jing Daily,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9kaW9yLWxvY2FsaXphdGlvbi1pbi1jaGluYS1sdXh1cnktbWFya2V0LW1hcmtldGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,":

With a record-breaking 83.6 million Chinese viewers for its spring 2021 collection, Dior successfully cashed at the recent annual Singles’ Day shopping festival via limited-editions and online promotions.

Dior has been trying out various digital strategies since 2015 when it became the first luxury brand to promote its offerings on WeChat Moments. And, back in 2018, Dior opened the first luxury livestream on WeChat.

Through its efforts to localize in China, the Christian Dior group recorded $21.6 billion in revenue during the first half of 2020, with 12 percent organic growth.

For LVMH, Dior is their cash cow and lab mouse, as the French fashion powerhouse is not afraid of testing the waters of the lucrative Chinese market. Though not every experiment has been a success, the forward-thinking brand is now decisively ahead in the localization game.

With a record-breaking 83.6 million Chinese viewers for its spring 2021 collection, Dior successfully cashed at the recent annual Singles’ Day shopping festival. For the first time, the brand rolled out a series of limited-edition products exclusively for the Double 11 event after announcing it on Dior’s official WeChat account on October 13. It’s the first time a top-tier luxury brand has released a capsule collection exclusively for the online shopping event.

At the same time, Dior’s parent group, LVMH, is relieving itself from outsourcing its e-commerce business to other multi-brand platforms by launching its own, called 24S . The platform, which is a one-stop shopping destination for brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and Givenchy, offered up to 30-percent off orders over $3,500 (23,000 yuan) as its own version of a Singles’ Day promotion. Tools like these are sure to stimulate younger buyers’ desire to buy. For example, an $840 (5,540 yuan) Dior Homme jumper is currently being marketed through a payment plan for $2.40 (15.18 yuan) per day, which is less than a daily coffee over 12 months. As such, the orders for Double 11 were so many that many companies had to ship goods from overseas markets to Mainland China.

Dior has been trying out various digital strategies for years now. Back in 2015, Dior became the first luxury brand to promote its offerings on WeChat Moments. And, in 2018, Dior opened the first luxury livestream on WeChat. It was also the first luxury brand to open up an online WeChat store for a handbag. In the same year, Dior took the initiative to become the first luxury brand to test out Douyin by opening its first official account. The French luxury brand also entered into the popular video-sharing platform Bilibili to further attract millennials and Gen Zers.

Aside from actively building the brand’s social media accounts, Dior is also working on converting that traffic into sales. In June 2020, Dior launched its official Tmall store right before the Chinese online shopping carnival 6.18. However, only skincare products, cosmetics, and perfumes were available on the Tmall store. Over 335,000 fans were collected in just one month.

As a result, the Christian Dior group recorded $21.6 billion in revenue during the first half of 2020, with 12 percent organic growth. But the road to localization can be bumpy sometimes. In 2019, Dior presented a workshop at Zhejiang Gongshang University and featured a map that did not show Taiwan. Within 12 hours, a video of the episode had been viewed over 1 million times on Weibo, resulting in more than 3,000 comments, most of them negative. The incident caused outrage among young netizens who have grown increasingly sensitive to an escalating series of cultural and geographic faux pas committed by Western brands.

On the way towards localization, brands must be very careful when featuring Chinese culture in their products, or it can look like a clumsy gimmick and will soon become a trending joke on the internet. For example, before the Double 11 capsule, Dior released a new, limited edition Book Tote and Diorcamp handbags in May where consumers can choose to add personalized Chinese characters to the bag. However, the response from Chinese netizens has been less than flattering. They found the design “weird and cheap.”

Through trial and error, Dior learned how to understand the Chinese market better. During this year’s Shanghai art week, Dior rolled out the fifth installment of its Dior Lady Art artist collaboration series alongside the art that inspired the collaborations. To amplify the project to customers of spending-power levels in China, the brand set up an afternoon tea area inside the art fair for VIPs to enjoy French pastries and a cup of cappuccino with the Dior logo in foam. At the same time, its army of local ambassadors showcased the bags for the brand’s millions of followers on social media. The seamless combination of Dior’s offline-to-online consumer journey showcased how the brand has grown over the years. As you can see, localization is a long and hard class to take, but the lessons are worth the effort."
Will Moncler's First Acquisition Win China Sales? - Jing Daily,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluYS1tb25jbGVyLXN0b25lLWlzbGFuZC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1yZW1vLXJ1ZmZpbmktbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

: Italian luxury group Moncler has announced that it will acquire the casual luxury brand Stone Island in a cash-and-share deal valued at $1.39 billion. Under Chief Executive Remo Ruffini, Moncler has become an industry favorite and, following this news, the company’s shares went up 4 percent. The company, listed since 2013, had a pre-pandemic market value of over $13 billion .

For many labels, 2020 has been a struggle for Moncler: H1’s financial results reported revenues of $473 million, which was down 29 percent compared to the previous year - mostly due to store closures and declining foot traffic. A bright spot, however, was the brand’s double-digit growth in Mainland China.

The Jing Take

: The deal is Moncler’s first purchase and, on its face, a smaller rival like Stone Island seems like an unlikely target for purchase. If anything, industry insiders expected Moncler itself to be bought. This is just the latest in a line of deals to be agreed upon this year despite the catastrophic conditions facing brands. Farfetch, VF Corp, and Launchmetrics, to name a few, have all recently inked deals. Stone Island now becomes a feather in the cap for Moncler, but with talk of Italian resilience and solidarity, does the brand have loftier ambitions? It may well be the first step in setting up another luxury conglomerate to rival France’s major players: LVMH and Kering.

But highest on Moncler's agenda, naturally enough, is China. It will move its yearly flagship show from Milan to the Mainland to reach more consumers (or should that be citizens?). In October, it launched a China-exclusive Moncler Young Icons collection as a way to keep younger luxury consumers engaged. And, it's working: Moncler's most recent Weibo post with ambassador Song Qian received 13,000 likes and 1638 comments.

On the other hand, Stone Island has a modest Weibo following of only 60,000 and little traction thus far. Earlier this year, Ruffini told Jing Daily that China is the perfect place for experimentation. Could it be planning to use Stone Island to trial new strategies in the market? The acquisition alone is enough to raise its profile among savvy shoppers.

As vaccines are slowly being rolled out across the West, all eyes remain focused on China’s market, which accounted for 90 percent of the luxury sector’s growth in 2019. Moreover, the country is predicted to carry the weight of luxury spending into the near future. For most brands, 2020 is the year they will want to forget. But they are far from safe. 2021 will see more casualties. As Ruffini said, Moncler is not waiting around for a recovery . It is setting a course to accelerate.

Macron and the moguls: Inside the fight over a 'French Fox News' - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWNyb24tbW9ndWxzLWluc2lkZS1maWdodC1vdmVyLTA2MDU0NTk3OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Michel Rose, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Mathieu Rosemain

PARIS (Reuters) - Behind the corporate battle for French media company Lagardere, there's a political tug-of-war involving the country's richest man, a media magnate and President Emmanuel Macron.

At stake is control of one of France's best-known private radio stations and its power to sway voters ahead of France's presidential election in 2022, when Macron could face off once again with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.

Macron fears that if media tycoon Vincent Bollore wins Lagardere, he could use its Europe 1 radio to inundate the airwaves with right-wing views and make the president's re-election bid even tougher, two sources close to the matter said.

So when Bollore's Vivendi built a stake in Lagardere in April, Macron's office relayed its concerns to Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of luxury goods empire LVMH and one of the president's early supporters, the sources said.

""The situation is being followed closely from on high,"" one of the two sources told Reuters.

Weeks later, Arnault stepped into the fight, backing Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere's holding company with funds and pledging his support to the son of the company's late founder Jean-Luc, whom Arnault has said was his best friend.

Macron's office and a spokesman for Bollore declined to comment. LVMH did not respond to requests for comment on behalf of Arnault.

At the time, Arnault's move was seen as an attempt to bolster its defences in tandem with Bollore against the Amber Capital hedge fund in London, which has also built up a stake in Lagardere and campaigned to change the company's management.

A source familiar with Arnault's thinking said his attachment to Jean-Luc Lagardere was genuine, and had prompted him to act when his son sought help to fend off Amber Capital.

But the billionaire's move puzzled French business rivals.

FRENCH FOX?

Story continues

After a career built on a reputation for penny-pinching on deals such as LVMH's renegotiated purchase of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, they wondered whether Arnault may have had another motive for ploughing funds into Lagardere.

After his initial investment of 80 million euros ($97 million), Arnault bought a direct stake of 7.75% in Lagardere, which is worth 209 million euros now.

Speculation has been growing in French media that there was a political angle to Arnault's surprise move to invest in a company racking up losses and debts as the coronavirus pandemic battered its global network of airport retail outlets.

Macron's inner circle was concerned that through Vivendi, now Lagardere's biggest shareholder, Bollore could consolidate his media assets and build a French version of U.S. conservative media network ""Fox News"", helped by Europe 1, the sources said.

Shortly after Arnault invested in Lagardere, a first pitch by Bollore to buy Europe 1 in June for 250 million euros was turned down by Lagardere's management, a third source said.

Vivendi declined to comment.

The company already owns France's biggest pay-TV company Canal Plus, whose free-to-air news channel CNews has taken a conservative turn since Bollore took control.

Anti-immigration and hardline law-and-order comments made by some of its talk show hosts regularly inflame social media and both its viewership and advertising revenues have jumped.

The network's boss Serge Nedjar has acknowledged that some of its commentators are provocative but said in a recent interview that the priority of CNews was to host open debates on all topics and there was no political line.

Lagardere's Europe 1 station has struggled with losses and falling audience numbers but has kept a following among urban, educated and more conservative-leaning listeners.

'NO MORAL BARRIER'

While Lagardere's arcane ownership structure gives its chief executive the right to veto significant decisions despite holding only 7% of the company, analysts still expect its major investors to try to grab bits of the business.

Vivendi now holds a 27% stake and has teamed up with Amber on 20% to push for board changes. Even Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, Lagardere's long-silent third biggest investor with 13%, has called for fair representation for all shareholders.

The moves have put pressure on Lagardere's management to deal with the situation, especially the billionaire dealmakers, while Amber Capital has maintained its campaign for an overhaul to drive a better share price performance.

Four sources close to the situation said discussions over how parts of Lagardere could be spun off had begun in recent weeks. One said that Arnault and Bollore had met in person.

The two have never been direct business rivals, and are not especially close, but neither is interested in an all-out war over Lagardere, people who know them said.

Bollore may be content to pick up parts of Lagardere's publishing division, home to Hachette, or agree to cede some media assets even if he launched a full takeover, an option that could unblock the complex saga, people close to the talks said.

Such scenarios were still speculative, the people said.

Letting Arnault take Lagardere's media outlets, which include the Paris Match weekly and Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, however, could pose issues. The billionaire already controls financial daily Les Echos and newspaper Le Parisien.

Lagardere also owns a travel retail business, but the sector has been hit hard as the pandemic has pummelled the travel industry, and Arnault is experiencing similar problems within LVMH, which owns duty-free retail chain DFS.

But for those planning Macron's re-election campaign, keeping Europe 1 away from Bollore is a priority, especially given the growing popularity of CNews and its right-leaning commentators.

Its viewership doubled in October from last year and while it still trails France's market leader BFM, it's ahead of TF1's LCI news channel - and its transformation is not just alarming those in the corridors of power.

""The general idea is: in the name of freedom of expression, any right-wing person is welcome. There's no moral barrier,"" said Sebastien Cochelin, a CFDT union representative for Canal Plus. ""We're playing with fire.""

Gabriela Hearst Unveiled as Chloé's New Artistic Director (Published 2020) - The New York Times,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvMDcvZmFzaGlvbi9nYWJyaWVsYS1oZWFyc3QtY2hsb2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"And so a new era begins at Chloé. Less than a week after the departure of Natacha Ramsay-Levi following a four year tenure, the French fashion house announced Gabriela Hearst as its new artistic director, effective immediately.

Ms. Hearst, a Uruguayan-born women’s ready-to-wear and accessories designer who founded a namesake luxury label in 2015, had been widely tipped in recent months for the role. In just five years, her brand has gained respect and recognition across the industry for its honed focus on casual elegance, sharp tailoring and use of sustainably sourced textiles, albeit at sky-high prices.

Last year, in New York, she held the industry’s first carbon-neutral fashion show and was named American women’s wear designer of the year at the CFDA Fashion Awards. This September, she held her debut presentation at Paris Fashion Week — one of around 20 that had a live audience. LVMH Luxury Ventures, an investment arm of the multinational luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, took a minority stake in the Gabriela Hearst business in January 2019; the brand recorded revenues of around $24 million last year."

Here is a look at some of the most noteworthy deals and M&A-related legal battles of 2020 …

1. LVMH, Tiffany Reach New $15.8 Billion Deal, Agree to Settle Legal Dispute

LVMH and Tiffany & Co. managed to salvage their multi-billion dollar acquisition deal in late October. In a statement on October 29, the parties confirmed that LVMH will pay $131.5 per Tiffany share, down from the $135/share price tag they initially agreed to in November 2019 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a whole, the deal amounts to a whopping $15.8 billion merger.

In announcing the new merger terms, the French luxury goods conglomerate and the New York-based jewelry company revealed that they had settled the bitter legal dispute that Tiffany & Co. initiated in a Delaware court this fall. LVMH’s attempt to back out of the initial $16.2 billion deal swiftly prompted Tiffany to file suit, seeking an order from a Delaware Chancery Court judge requiring LVMH to “abide by its contractual obligation under the merger agreement to complete the transaction on the agreed terms.”

LVMH responded by threatening litigation of its own on the grounds that its board “had the opportunity to examine the current economic situation of Tiffany and its “first half results and perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable LVMH Group [brands] during this period.” In the complaint that it did eventually file, LVMH argued, among other things, that Tiffany “hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight,” and asserted that “Tiffany’s performance will continue to be poor.” With that in mind, and given “the decision by two sophisticated parties, represented by sophisticated advisers, to omit a pandemic carve,” LVMH stated the pandemic has, in fact, “caused a material adverse effect that allows LVMH to terminate.”

2. Farfetch’s $1.1 Billion Deal with Richemont, Alibaba Exemplifies Some Existing Trends in Luxury

A $1.15 billion deal between Cartier’s parent company Richemont, Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba, and fashion retail platform Farfetch was big news in the luxury market this year. In a statement in early November, Swiss conglomerate Richemont and Alibaba revealed that they will invest a total of $1.1 billion in Farfetch and its new venture specifically tailored to the Chinese market, confirming rumors that a mega-deal was in the making. Meanwhile, Artemis – an investment vehicle tied to Gucci owner Kering – simultaneously announced that it would increase its stake in Farfetch with a $50 million injection of cash in exchange for Farfetch’s Class A ordinary shares.

Beyond the focus on China, the headline-making deal plays to two existing but ever-accelerating trends in fashion/luxury in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: the rampant adoption of e-commerce by notoriously digitally-averse high fashion and luxury brands, and an enduring consolidation of players in the upper echelon of the industry.

The deal appears to play into the larger fortification-but-consolidation trend underway, which as the Financial Times wrote last year, has enabled “LVMH, Kering and Richemont [to] all grow through acquisitions while smaller players have sought the security of bigger groups, such as Versace, which was sold to Michael Kors, now Capri Holdings, for $2 billion in late 2018.”

Given the rising investments of these industry titans when it comes to e-commerce sales and the costs associated with perfecting the digital consumer experience, more generally, buy-outs by big players are expected to continue throughout 2021. The WSJ’s Carol Ryan points to “underperforming listed brands like Tod’s, or those still in founders’ hands, such as shoemaker Christian Louboutin,” as potential targets.

3. Vans’ Parent Company VF Corp. Buying Streetwear Brand Supreme in $2.1 Billion Deal

Supreme has a new owner. Three years after selling off a reported 50 percent stake to private equity giant Carlyle Group, VF Corp revealed on November 9 that it would pay $2.1 billion to buy popular streetwear brand. Denver, Colorado-headquartered VF Corp – which owns a number of brands, including Vans, The North Face, Eastpak, and Timberland – said it would make “an additional payment of up to $300 million subject to satisfaction of certain post-closing milestones.”

The headline-making deal will see VF Corp. take full ownership of Supreme, with current Supreme investors Carlyle Group and New York-based private equity firm Goode Partners agreeing to sell their stakes in the New York-based brand that American-British businessman James Jebbia founded in 1994 and catapulted to streetwear success over the past two decades thanks to its meticulously-crafted strategy of dropping limited edition wares, many of which are branded with Supreme’s name and red-and-white box logo, branding that has found significant fame and no shortage of infringement across the globe.

The key question from the time of the Carlyle cash injection remains in play, particularly in light of chatter about aggressive expansion: Can Supreme be cool and corporate at the same time?

4. Ferrari Majority Stakeholder Will Acquire Hermès-Owned Shang Xia in China-Focused Move

In a release from Exor early this month, the holding company revealed that it will invest “around €80 million [$96.9 million] in Shang Xia via a reserved capital increase that will result in it becoming the company’s majority shareholder.” Exor noted that Hermès – which “has accompanied Shang Xia successfully throughout the initial phase of its development – will remain as an important shareholder alongside Exor and [founder] Jiang Qiong Er.”

The pairing between Hermès and Exor by way of Shang Xia – whose array of upscale home goods, silk scarves, streamlined leather goods, and refined apparel offerings are not a terribly far cry from those of Hermès – is certainly an interesting one. While Exor is not known for its holdings in the fashion industry, it is, nonetheless, well equipped in the luxury space, as a leading shareholder in Ferrari, where Exor chairman and CEO John Elkann holds the chairman role.

Exor’s sweeping stake in Ferrari – which as of 2015 sees it maintain a total voting power of nearly 50 percent with Piero Ferrari, son of the Italian automaker’s founder Enzo Ferrari – speaks to its might in the luxury market. It also sheds light on a number of noteworthy commonalities between Hermès and Ferrari, given that Ferrari is far more a luxury entity in the business of employing luxury manufacturing, marketing, and distribution methods than a traditional automaker.

5. There’s More to it Than Market Share, What the FTC’s Quest to Block Billie-P&G Merger Means for DTC Buy-Outs

On the heels of P&G and Billie revealing that they had reached an M&A deal in January 2020, the Federal Trade Commission swooped in to call foul. The basis for its action: The acquisition would “eliminate substantial and growing head-to-head competition” between Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G – “the market-leading supplier of both women’s and men’s wet shave razors” – and “nascent competitor Billie” in U.S. wet shave razor markets.

The FTC’s move to halt the Billie acquisition is not the first of its kind this year. In fact, the government agency filed an administrative complaint in February, in which it asserted that it had “reason to believe that Edgewell Personal Care Company and Harry’s, Inc. have executed a merger agreement in violation of [various sections] of the FTC Act,” as well as the Clayton Antitrust Act. As it turns out, Edgewell, the shaving company that owns a stable of household names from Playtex and Skintimate to shaving brands Schick Edge and Wilkinson Sword, had made Harry’s a $1.37 billion dollar offer, and the burgeoning direct-to-consumer shaving company took it.

The striking aspect of the FTC’s recent DTC shaving company-centric activity: it appears to go against the fact that antitrust agencies “traditionally consider current competition between merging parties and look to their existing market shares as indicators of competitive strength” in order to determine if anticompetition concerns are potentially afoot. The larger the market shares at play, the more likely there will be FTC pushback on the basis of competition, and thus, small share gains – such as 2.5 percent – have largely fallen outside of the realm of FTC action.

Yet, Billie and Harry’s – both of which relatively small when it comes to market share – caught the FTC’s attention, nonetheless, since “for several years, the federal antitrust agencies, particularly the FTC, have been developing a concept known as ‘nascent competition.’” In other words, the agency has been opposing instances in which the acquisition target is a small, but rapidly growing entity – or “disruptive” competitor of a larger, dominant company.

6. A $1.1 Billion Brand, 3 Lawsuits and COVID-19: The Breakdown of the $525 Million Victoria’s Secret Deal

As of this spring, a major deal was up in the air in the midst of turmoil in the COVID-19 retail landscape: Sycamore Partners’ $525 million proffer for Victoria’s Secret. After signing off on a deal in late February to acquire 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret from its parent company L Brands, Sycamore wanted out, and it pointed to the global health pandemic – and the ailing lingerie giant’s response to it – as its basis for attempting to retract on the deal.

A string of since-settled lawsuits between the two parties got its start on April 22 when Sycamore filed suit against L Brands in a Delaware Chancery court, arguing that while the retail group was legally “required to operate the Victoria’s Secret business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice” until the deal closed (which was slated for the second quarter of this year), it failed to uphold its end of the bargain when it “decided to close the lingerie brand’s U.S. stores, furlough the majority of its workers, and skip April rent payments.”

More than that, counsel for Sycamore – which sought the court’s blessing to terminate on the deal that valued Victoria’s Secret at $1.1 billion – asserted that the onset of the “extraordinary” COVID-19 crisis brought an MAE clause in the parties’ agreement into effect, thereby, enabling it to walk away from the deal without incurring a steep penalty.

L Brands responded to Sycamore’s complaint with a lawsuit of its own on April 23, asking the same court to uphold the terms of the deal on the basis that “Sycamore’s current position is pure gamesmanship,” and “its invalid and improper termination” amounted to little more than a quest to scoop up the Victoria’s Secret brand for less than the formerly-agreed upon price.

And seemingly attempting to double-down in light of the potential weakness in its initial suit thanks to the pandemic exception, Sycamore filed a second complaint on April 24, arguing that if the parties’ deal was not already off the table, L Brand’s countersuit has formally “invalidated the financing that [Sycamore] had lined up” to acquire the company.

The parties revealed that they had formally called off the deal, and settled their rival lawsuits by early May.

7. Why Two Retail Giants Are Buying Distressed Mall Brands Out of Bankruptcy

Mall giant Simon Property Group and Authentic Brands Group – the owner and licensor of over 50 well-known brands, ranging from Juicy Couture to Judith Leiber – have been working together over the past few years to buy-up bankrupt companies’ assets (from their real estate but more importantly their intellectual property and large swathes of consumer data), in some cases, at a notably discounted rate – with Barneys, Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, and Forever 21 among their targets.

“In the short-term, these acquisitions should prove to be lucrative for both Simon and Authentic Brands,” according to Goulston & Storrs PC attorneys Vanessa Moody and Yara Kass-Gergi. “As a result of [their acquisition of these retailers, Simon – the largest shopping mall operator in America – is able to better control the occupancy rates at its shopping centers, helping to ensure their continued viability,” they note, “while ABG benefits by having its retail business partner also be the landlord of many of its brick and mortar store locations.”

As for their prospects for longer-term success, both for SPARC Group – the joint venture that Simon and ABG launched in early 2020 – and the companies that SPARC is readily taking ownership of, Moody and Kass-Gergi say that is less obvious. “The future impact of COVID-19 on retail, including retailers’ ability to ride out any significant second or third rounds of governmentally mandated store closures, remains entirely uncertain.” As a result, they claim that “any expansion of retail holdings and physical store locations comes with some inherent risk,” including potential issues over “whether SPARC will be able to retain the high quality of the brands it acquires as it continues to acquire more and more companies is another question.”

Additionally, it is worth noting, per Moody and Kass-Gergi, that at least “some competitors and other interested parties are already starting to quietly wonder whether the growing list of retailers under the Simon and Authentic Brands umbrella does or should at some point raise antitrust concerns,” which could prove interesting.

8. Misappropriation by Acquisition: Are M&A Discussions Setting Companies Up for Complicated Lawsuits?

Misappropriation by acquisition cases are having a moment in the fashion/beauty space. On the heels of Olaplex landing a $66 million win in the trade secret suit it filed against L’Oreal in January 2017 (less than a year after the enactment of the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act), in which the haircare startup accused the beauty titan of pilfering confidential information about its products during potential M&A discussions, three similar suits have since been filed. Le Tote sued Urban Outfitters in June, alleging that the company has stolen its trade secret-protected business model under the alleged guise of a potential acquisition in order to create a rival fashion rental business, Nuuly.

Around the very same time, Seed Beauty – the Southern California-based company responsible for “creating, developing, manufacturing, storing, selling, and distributing” the products of the billion dollar beauty ventures of Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner – filed two separate trade secret lawsuits: one against Kardashian’s KKW Beauty, and another against Coty, Inc. and Kylie Jenner’s corporate entity, in connection with Coty’s acquisitions of stakes in the half-sisters’ buzzy brands.

In both of its complaints, Seed alleges that as a result of the cutting-edge nature of its business model, the details of its “creative and logistical development services” and the terms of the “exclusive relationships [it has] with its beauty brand partners” amount to “highly sensitive, confidential and trade secret information.” Those “highly sensitive and confidential” elements of its business are at risk, Seed claims, due to Jenner and Kardashian’s respective headline-making deals with Coty, thereby.

The cases present an important look at how trade secret information becomes an issue in the context of acquisitions. While traditionally under-discussed, trade secret misappropriation by acquisition has received increased attention in recent years in light of headline-making matters, such as the since-settled lawsuit between Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber, a case that centered on Uber’s acquisition of self-driving startup Ottomotto.

The currently-ongoing cases also come as part of a larger movement that includes a growing amount of trade secret litigation. As a result of “the digitization of intellectual property and ongoing competition across industries,” as well as an increase in M&A discussions in light of a larger trend towards consolidation, among other macro developments, companies are at elevated risk of trade secret theft, and no small number are responding to such threats and instances of misappropriation by “increasingly engaging in legal proceedings specific to trade secrets.”"

LVMH renamed the brand Pink Shirtmaker in November of 2018 to aim for a premium price point. But the coronavirus pandemic has essentially halted sales of office clothing and formal wear as group gatherings, whether in the office or for social occasions, are suspended amid social distancing.

Pink over the summer closed its U.K. and New York City flagship stores and shut branches at Heathrow Airport. Pink is no longer listed on LMVH’s list of fashion and leather goods brands, and its website and social channels are no longer operating, British fashion outlet Drapers first reported.

Executives at LVMH declined comment.

The news follows British men’s wear firm TM Lewin’s July collapse into administration, which shuttered 66 stores. Torque Brands, an investment venture affiliated with Stonebridge, acquired the brand’s assets.

In November, men’s chain Moss Bros launched a company voluntary arrangement to restructure operations and cut costs across a 128-store fleet.

In the U.S., the J. Hilburn and John Varvatos brands each filed Chapter 11 petitions in May, followed by the August bankruptcies of Brooks Brothers in July and Tailored Brands Inc., which operates The Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores Clothing for Men and the K&G Fashion Superstore nameplates. All have exited Chapter 11."
Moët Hennessy invests in Whistlepig rye whiskey - The Drinks Business,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzEyL21vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktaW52ZXN0cy1pbi13aGlzdGxlcGlnLXJ5ZS13aGlza2V5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Phoebe French

Moët Hennessy has acquired a minority stake in Vermont-based farm-to-bottle rye whiskey brand Whistlepig as part of a new distribution partnership between the companies.

As part of the deal, Moët Hennessy will help Whistlepig expand into other international markets after its successful experience in the UK.

The arrangement will not affect the whiskey’s distribution partnerships in North America, but will instead focus on other overseas markets.

In a statement, the distiller said it had been actively exploring expansion for the past year, and that Moët Hennessy would “accelerate its efforts”.

Wilco Faessen, co-founder of Whistlepig, added: “We have long admired LVMH as a builder of amazing brands and products, and we have learned a lot from Moët Hennessy over the years. We believe there is a great portfolio fit, and, critically, that our cultures are very much aligned in terms of patiently building our brands and business over time, with a focus on quality and a differentiated experience for our consumers and our customers. Formalizing this through an investment in the company plus a comprehensive route to market partnership internationally is another critical milestone in our journey.”

Founded in 2007 by Raj Bhakta, a former contestant on the US version of The Apprentice, Whistlepig opened its grain-to-glass distillery in October 2015 on its 500-acre farm. Bhakta sold his shares in the company last year, the same year in which Whistlepig sold a minority stake of its business to investment banking firm BDT Capital Partners.

Philippe Schaus, president and CEO of Moët Hennessy, added: “We are convinced that Whistlepig fits well within Moët Hennessy’s portfolio. This rye whiskey house has done a remarkable job distinguishing itself among the emblematic and iconic craft distilleries in the United States with an ultra-premium standing in terms of identity, quality and price positioning.

“We are looking forward to the opportunity for our team to bring the Whistlepig brand and product portfolio to many of our most valued customers around the world.”

LVMH made its first investment in US whiskey with the acquisition of Woodinville, based in Washington state, in 2017."
Louis Vuitton: Using Animal Skins Is Not Humane - PETA UK,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnLnVrL2Jsb2cvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hbmltYWwtc2tpbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In response to Louis Vuitton’s statements that 100% of the animals used for the company’s products are “humanely farmed”, PETA has one major question: how in the world could the exotic-skins industry – in which workers sometimes skin crocodiles alive and stun ostriches with electricity before slitting their throats – be considered humane?

The answer: it isn’t. In a letter to Michael Burke, the CEO of Louis Vuitton, PETA US pushed back against his recent claims that the company uses humanely sourced materials:

“Despite this assurance to consumers, there is no such thing as ‘humanely farmed’ animals who are violently killed and skinned for Louis Vuitton products.”

No matter how animals are killed, there’s no humane way to exploit them for their skins.

Crocodiles and Ostriches Are Killed for Their Skins

A PETA video exposé of a crocodile farm in Vietnam that has supplied skins to LVMH (the parent company of Louis Vuitton) showed crocodiles packed into concrete enclosures, some narrower than the length of their bodies. At another farm, crocodiles were packed into small, filthy concrete pits with other reptiles, exposing them to injury, disease, and aggression – one crocodile was even missing a tail.

Another PETA exposé of the largest ostrich slaughter companies in the world – including Klein Karoo International, which supplied ostrich leather to Louis Vuitton – revealed workers striking ostriches in the face during transport, forcibly restraining them, pushing them into stun boxes, and slitting their throats in front of others slated for a similar fate.

In addition, LVMH has yet to join the long list of designers that have gone fur-free, even though multiple investigations into the fur industry have revealed cruelty across the board.

The Skins Industry Is Cruel

No animal should be used for clothing or accessories under any circumstances, but these horrifying conditions are standard. No matter how far the company goes to “humane wash” its products, the skins industry is still harming and exploiting animals.

As described in a report that LVMH was provided with in 2016, this cruelty is standard wherever animals are killed for human use. And PETA’s exposés of the wool, down, and leather industries have revealed that it’s nothing but wishful thinking to expect that certifications – which neither Louis Vuitton nor LVMH even require for all suppliers in their chain – somehow prevent egregious harm.

Crocodiles are magnificent animals who can live to be 80 years old in their natural habitat, where they enjoy playing and digging tunnels. Ostriches are the fastest land animals on two legs and can reach speeds of up to 60 mph. These animals don’t belong in captivity, on cutting tables, or in accessories – no animal does.

What You Can Do

Dozens of major designers and retailers, including Calvin Klein, Chanel, Liberty, and Selfridges, have removed exotic skins from their collections. PETA will continue to put the pressure on LVMH executives until they get the memo that animals are not ours to exploit for handbags, clothing, or anything else. Will you join us?"
PETA blasts Louis Vuitton over ‘Humanely Farmed’ animal claims - Totally Vegan Buzz,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvdGFsbHl2ZWdhbmJ1enouY29tL25ld3MvcGV0YS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWh1bWFuZWx5LWZhcm1lZC1hbmltYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The premier fashion label has claimed its uses only humanely sourced materials for its designs.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has threatened to file a lawsuit against Louis Vuitton over its ‘false claims’ of using humanely sourced materials, which could lead to a potential “consumer fraud action” against the fashion label as a result.

In a letter addressed to Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO Michael Burke, PETA’s Vice President and legal counsel Jared Goodman, demanded that Burke “immediately end [his] false representations that the animals used for Louis Vuitton products ‘are humanely farmed.’”

He added that such comments amount to “fraud,” and the organization hoped the luxury goods brand will recognize its “untenable position and, at the least, immediately cease making this and any other false claims to misrepresent the suffering inherent in your company’s supply chain.”

In another report, fashion insiders revealed the brand has also started using fox, chinchilla, and sable furs after the Danish mass mink cull disrupted mink fur supply.

Cruel exotic-skins industry

PETA and its affiliates have carried several undercover investigations to expose the cruelty of the exotic-skins industry, including within LVMH’s supply chain

Goodman in his letter cited a PETA-affiliate exposé of Vietnam crocodile farms, which supplied skins to LVMH for years.

The video showed the sordid conditions of the farms in which tens of thousands of crocodiles were imprisoned in small, concrete enclosures – some narrower than the length of their bodies.

No humane way to exploit animals

Concluding that “no matter how animals are killed, there is no humane way to exploit them for their skins,” Goodman added that several major designers, including Calvin Klein and Chanel, and retailers, such as Nordstrom and Selfridges, have already banned exotic skins from their supply chains and Louis Vuitton could “avoid legal proceedings” by removing all exotic skins from your offerings immediately.”

The animal charity has launched a petition to urge LVMH to shed fur and exotic skins from Louis Vuitton and all its other brands. You can be a part of it here.

THE LVMH GROUP IS THE KING OF STOCK MARKET • MVC Magazine - MVC Magazine,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbXZjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VuL3RoZS1sdm1oLWdyb3VwLWlzLXRoZS1raW5nLW9mLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH conquers the top of the Paris price lists. According to what we read on Fashionnetwork, the luxury giant, in fact, on Monday broke a historical record “reaching the largest capitalization of the Parisian stock market”. In the last twelve months (November 2019-November 2020), the luxury giant’s title has increased by almost 22%. In the last 30 days, the jump was nearly 17%. The exchange price of the shares of the group is currently around € 496. Multiplying the number of shares by their market price, their total value is 250 billion euros, the largest capitalization in France after L’Oréal (171.43 billion) and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi (107.01 billion). The leading competitor Kering is around 76.34 billion.

​

Bernard Arnault’s group is not immune to the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, but, according to data released in mid-October, compared to the Kering group, it immediately recovered from the economic problems caused by the lockdown. The turning point occurred in the third quarter of the year. In this period the decline in revenues was 21%. It was reabsorbed, reaching only 7%, with a particular recovery in the fashion sector driven by Louis Vuitton and Dior, with revenues rising by 12% and substantially return to the same values as the pre-lockdown.

A few days after the quarterly report publication, LVMH announced it had reached an agreement for the acquisition of Tiffany & Co at $ 131.5 per share, less than the originally agreed $ 135. The new deal values the New York company 15.96 billion dollars. The merger is expected to end at the beginning of the new year. The operation (which had suffered an abrupt halt last September, with the simultaneous launch of a legal battle between the two parties) allows LVMH to strengthen its position in the jewelry segment, a global market worth 20 billion dollars in 2019.

​

On an international level, the tech giants of Silicon Valley are leaving LVMH a lot behind in terms of capitalization, with Apple approaching $ 2 trillion and Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google) breaking through the trillion-dollar ceiling. Also far behind are Tesla (544.10 billion) and Facebook (784.96 billion)."
