Ivanka Trump's Manufacturer Just Bought Donna Karan Label From LVMH (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvMjYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svbHZtaC1zZWxscy1kb25uYS1rYXJhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For only the second time in its almost 30-year history, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury conglomerate in the world, is selling a fashion brand.

On Monday, the French company said that it had agreed to sell Donna Karan International to G-III Apparel Group, the American manufacturing and licensing company that owns Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin and Bass and holds the licenses for Ivanka Trump, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, among others. It said that the transaction had an enterprise value, a figure based on its stock market valuation plus the net debt on its books, of $650 million.

The last fashion brand that LVMH sold was Christian Lacroix in 2005.

In a statement, Antonio Belloni, LVMH group managing director, said that G-III “has the expertise and capabilities to broaden the brand’s distribution and take it to its next level of success.” Mr. Belloni said that the French company had not been looking to sell Donna Karan until it was contacted by G-III.

Pierre-Yves Roussel, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH Fashion Group (which includes Donna Karan), said in a telephone interview from Paris that, although the company had received several other expressions of interest after the news of a potential disposal leaked last week, no other buyers were considered.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999935626983643}",neutral,0.9999935626983643,0
LVMH is selling off DKNY - Page Six,"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAxNi8wNy8yMC9sdm1oLWlzLXNlbGxpbmctb2ZmLWRrbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Less than a year after fashion icon Donna Karan stepped down from the helm of the company that she founded, its owner — luxury goods giant Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy — is selling off the entire raft of game-changing brands that she founded, Page Six has learned.

The French empire — which has owned Karan’s company since 2001, even though she stayed on to run the brands — shelved her flagship line Donna Karan International shortly after she left in June 2015 and said it would “substantially increase its focus” on her DKNY brand, which revolutionized women’s fashion in the ’80s with Karan’s “Seven Easy Pieces” concept of a wardrobe made up of a handful of interchangeable items.

But we’re told that after seven months of disappointing performance under new designers Maxwell Osbourne and Dao-Yi of the Pubic School brand, LVMH has decided to sell both DKNY and DKI. We’re told the company, which also owns Marc and Givenchy, among dozens of other blue chip brands, is targeting a single, specific American buyer, rather than putting it out to multiple bidders.

Negotiations are said to be ongoing, but a price has not yet been agreed.

“Donna Karan and DKNY was a mega brand in the US, but all the things [LVMH] has done to change it and take it forward just haven’t worked,” said an insider, “The word is that they have a buyer in mind and have approached a US company to buy the brand, but it is not yet clear if the deal is going forward.”

Reps didn’t get back to us.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999632835388184}",neutral,0.9999632835388184,0
Pierre-Yves Roussel on Why LVMH Sold Donna Karan - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL3BpZXJyZS15dmVzLXJvdXNzZWwtb24td2h5LWx2bWgtaXMtc2VsbGluZy1kb25uYS1rYXJhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH's decision to sell Donna Karan International to American manufacturing and licensing company G-III Apparel Group was an unexpected move by the French luxury conglomerate, which rarely sells its brands.

Over the past 18 months, LVMH has spent considerable resource rebooting the company, cleaning up multiple licensing deals and re-positioning the label around its lower-priced DKNY diffusion brand, installing Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow of Public School as co-creative directors, whose first two collections received a cool critical reaction.

The scale of the investment was clear when, in April, LVMH partially attributed disappointing first-quarter sales figures in its fashion and leather goods division to the discontinuation of the DKNY Jeans and DKNY C lines, which represented lost income of around $200 million.

So why sell now?

According to Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and chief executive of LVMH's fashion group, the deal was the result of unsolicited, inbound interest from G-III, which makes licensed clothing for brands like Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld, and offered to buy the business at a high valuation of $650 million — and not because the reboot was a creative and commercial failure, as some have suggested.

“We were not looking to sell it,” Roussel revealed to BoF in an interview. “We had moved the pieces in the right direction and I think we were starting to move forward… But [G-III] came with a very high price.”

On further reflection, Roussel said the group also realised that DKNY’s diffusion brand business model was a poor fit for LVMH, whose core expertise is rooted in growing luxury brands with a focus on accessories, selective distribution and brand-building runway shows. Diffusion brands, by contrast, usually rely on ready-to-wear and wide wholesale distribution through department stores.

""DKNY is a different model,"" said Roussel. ""Our decision had nothing to do with the creative casting. I still believe that the brand can be really big. But it is going to be big under their umbrella. I think we could have done it and if we didn’t have that offer, we could have pushed it for the next two, three, four years and I’m sure with success, but probably not as much success as [G-III] would do because it’s their core model. You know, at the end of the day, there is only so much that you can do. We have a lot of brands, there is investment, but where should we invest our money, what’s our best deal?”

Roussel stressed that LVMH was still committed to developing its contemporary brands, taking care to differentiate these from a diffusion brand like DKNY and citing the group's success with Marc Jacobs and Kenzo.

""They have to have some characteristics. It has to have a strong brand and a real accessories business, which we did with Kenzo, it’s a very targeted and controlled distribution, obviously it has a European legacy, which is very different,” he added.

“We like that segment. We’ve been learning,"" he continued. ""So we are not divesting from contemporary by any means, we are actually interested in that segment. But there is [only] so much you can elevate DKNY as a brand. You can inject energy and creativity but if you look at Kenzo... we have not fundamentally changed the positioning. We've actually taken Kenzo down, in a way, from where it was. Marc Jacobs, we are rebranding everything with Marc Jacobs.""

Reflecting on the similarities between contemporary and luxury business models, Roussel continued: ""That's why there are a lot of luxury players, hiring contemporary and vice versa — designers doing one or the other, and so on because there are differences but also there is much more crossover, whereas diffusion is a different model.""

As for the team at Donna Karan, prized chief executive Caroline Brown will continue to oversee the brand for a transitional period until the sale to G-III is complete, said Roussel, adding that Brown and G-III founder Morris Goldfarb were meeting to discuss the future. ""It's a big deal for him, so I'm sure he will rely on the team. It will be discussed with the management team, it will be discussed with the creative team and it will be their decision.""

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors which has a minority stake in The Business of Fashion.

What Happens to DKNY Now That LVMH Has Sold It? - The Cut,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxNi8wNy9sdm1oLXNlbGxzLWRrbnktZG9ubmEta2FyYW4tcmVsYXVuY2guaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DKNY fall 2016.

Today, LVMH, which has been looking to sell Donna Karan International, announced that G-III will be buying the brand for $650 million, per a release from the company. (LVMH has owned the Donna Karan and DKNY brands since 1996.) G-III is a notably less starry affair than LVMH, but it has a solid portfolio, with fashion companies like G.H. Bass and Andrew Marc, and licensing deals with Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. It’s unusual for LVMH to make a sale like this — the last brand they sold was Christian Lacroix, more than a decade ago — and it’s unclear how that will change things at DKNY, which is currently helmed by Public School’s Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow.

Their debut season at the brand, in which they paid direct homage to DKNY’s ‘90s heyday, was met with unenthusiastic reviews, though last season’s sweatshirt-heavy show fared better critically. It sounds like the new owner is eager to take things in a more commercial direction. Given G-III’s gung-ho plans to double the size of its business in the next three years, will Chow and Osborne be along for the ride?

Meanwhile, there’s some good news for Donna Karan fans: The namesake brand has lain dormant since the house founder left last year, but G-III plans to relaunch the beloved line in some form. After all, in fashion, nothing ever really goes away.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7726628184318542}",positive,0.7726628184318542,1
LVMH to Sell Donna Karan International to G-III Apparel Co. - WWD,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc2VsbC1kb25uYS1rYXJhbi1naWlpLWFwcGFyZWwtZ3JvdXAtMTA0OTU2MjEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"G-III Apparel Group saw its shares fall by more than 4 percent to $47.95 in early trading today after it agreed to buy Donna Karen International from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton for $650 million.

The transaction is expected to close in late 2016 or early 2017. LVMH had acquired DKI in 2001 for $643 million.

The sale represents the end of a long-running struggle by LVMH to turn Donna Karan into an American luxury brand on par with the others in the group’s stables — and represents a rare stumble by luxury titan Bernard Arnault. The French stock market was cheered by LVMH’s decision to cut its losses, sending the company’s shares up 1.2 percent to 144 euros, or $158.40 at current exchange.

Morris Goldfarb, chairman, chief executive officer and president of G-III, the $2.4 billion diversified apparel company, said, “Donna Karan International is an iconic global fashion company. Its lifestyle aesthetic resonates well with consumers throughout the world. We are excited to build upon its strong foundation as we seek to capitalize on a significant market opportunity. Donna Karan brings increased scale and diversification, while providing incremental growth on top of our portfolio of some the best fashion brands in the world. We believe we are well positioned to create and sustain additional value for our shareholders, partners and customers.”

Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, said, “Donna Karan International has a deep heritage, global recognition, and renewed energy. We believe the DKNY brand has a dynamic position in the market, and when G-III approached us about acquiring the brand, we concluded that the time was right and that G-III was the right steward going forward.”

He added that he believes G-III has “the expertise and capabilities to broaden the brand’s distribution and take it to the next level of success.”

In addition, Belloni said, “We are grateful to ceo Caroline Brown, creative directors Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow, and the entire management and design teams for the strategic actions that created a platform to support DKNY’s continued growth.”

G-III doesn’t plan to update its financial guidance to reflect the effect of the acquisition until it has closed, although G-III added that, excluding purchase accounting charges and other adjustment, it preliminarily expects the acquisition to be dilutive in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, and accretive thereafter.

G-III plans to fund the acquisition through new indebtedness, $75 million of newly issued G-III common stock to LVMH, and a $75 million, six-and-a-half-year seller note. In connection with the acquisition, G-III has obtained financing commitments from Barclays and JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. for a $525 million, ABL credit facility and a $450 million six-year term loan. The closing of the transaction is not subject to financing conditions.

Barclays is acting as exclusive financial adviser to G-III. Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP are acting as legal advisers to G-III. Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum & Nagelberg LLP is acting as legal adviser to LVMH.

In the last several years, G-III has successfully transformed itself into a broad-based apparel company, as it has pursued a diversification strategy.

G-III manufactures and distributes apparel and accessories under licensed brands, owned brands and private label brands. Its own brands include Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Bass G.H. Bass, Weejuns, G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J, Black Rivet and Jessica Howard. It has licensed businesses with Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Guess, Jones New York, Jessica Simpson, Vince Camuto, Ivanka Trump, Ellen Tracy, Kensie, Levi’s and Dockers brands. Through its team sports business, G-III has licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Hands High, Touch by Alyssa Milano and more than 100 U.S. colleges and universities. G-III also operates retail stores under the Wilsons Leather, Bass, G.H. Bass & Co., Vilebrequin and Calvin Klein Performance names.

In February, G-III signed a multiyear licensing agreement with PVH Corp. to design, produce and distribute Tommy Hilfiger women’s wear collections in the U.S. and Canada. G-III is also the licensee for Calvin Klein’s women’s sportswear, suits, dresses, performance wear, handbags, luggage and cold weather accessories. It is the second-largest licensee for the Calvin Klein brand.

For the first quarter, G-III’s net income was $2.8 million, compared to $6.8 million in the year ago quarter, while net sales reached a record of $457.4 million compared to $433 million in the year-ago quarter.

There have been continual reports over the last decade or more that LVMH was looking to sell DKI, even though LVMH typically doesn’t sell its properties. Last year, DKI suspended the production of the Donna Karan Collection to focus the entire company around the DKNY brand and removed Donna Karan from the top creative role. The company also replaced Jane Chung, executive vice president of design at DKNY, with Chow and Osborne, the founders and creative directors of Public School, who are now co-creative directors of DKNY.

A source familiar with the deal said that Chow, Osborne and Brown are expected to stay on through at least the closing. G-III is expected to come out with an announcement of the company’s plans going forward.

In the last year under Brown’s leadership, DKI has changed several senior executives, closed the Madison Avenue flagship at 60th Street and launched new image campaigns. In March, DKNY unveiled a new store concept on West Broadway in SoHo. For Osborne and Chow, the SoHo redesign represented the next chapter in DKNY’s evolution. Earlier this month, the company unveiled a completely redesigned 1,468-square-foot store at the Forum Shop at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

DKI has seen several key executive changes throughout the year, including several longtime employees such as Mary Wang, former president of DKNY, and Carol Sharpe, president of retail at DKNY. In March, Hector Muelas, chief image officer at DKI, exited the firm after less than a year in the role.

Chow and Osborne have only designed DKNY for two seasons and the collection is in the early stages of a rebuilding mode, but LVMH executives have said DKNY has been performing well.

Still, DKI remained a drag on its parent. In April, LVMH said discontinued lines at DKI (the DKNY Jeans and DKNYC ranges) and Marc Jacobs International contributed to stalled first-quarter sales at the group’s fashion and leather goods division.

DKI was established in 1984, and DKNY was launched in 1989. The DKNY brand currently generates more than $300 million in volume and has offices in New York, Milan and Hong Kong. It also has stores throughout the U.S., Asia and Europe.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8365404605865479}",positive,0.8365404605865479,1
LVMH Vice President DELPHINE ARNAULT: “IT IS HARD TO REJECT FASHION” - 032c,"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vMDMyYy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvdGhlLWxvdHRhLWRlbHBoaW5lLWNvbXBsZXgtMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If industry wisdom is now crowd-sourced, who makes the decisions in fashion? The power-center once called “the establishment” has become an amorphous blob that dilates and contracts with the flux of trending topics. The desires of demand run in every direction at once, and those who succeed at latching onto them in real time are instantly rewarded with sky-rocketing revenue.

In this context, LOTTA VOLKOVA and DELPHINE ARNAULT are two opposite yet equally powerful sources of gravity. One is the stylist behind the underground brand that has staged a coup d’etat in the luxury sector, and one is the heir apparent to the world’s largest lifestyle conglomerate. One is a club kid from Vladivostok, and one is Parisian fashion royalty. In the past, the two of them would be thrown into an uptown-downtown dichotomy. But the war between the mainstream and the underground is at a standstill. In today’s democratized age of hypercapitalism, with fashion’s hierarchies fossilized by new media, these distinctions have become outdated. The future of fashion is defined by convergence. Volkova and Arnault share in an ability to navigate a complex set of contradictions. Fashion is a business. Fashion is an art. But they both believe in one monolithic truth: The consumer is the one in charge.

In this first instalment of the The Lotta-Delphine Complex, 032c talks to Delphine Arnault.

Avenue Montaigne in Paris’s 8th Arrodissement is clean and sparkly at all hours of the day. With its trimmed trees and an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower at its end, all existence feels re-touched here. The world’s most prestigious brands are lined up on the avenue in grandiose temples. But one façade remains inaccessible to the public. Behind it lie the headquarters of fashion’s leading luxury group: Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. LVMH consists of 70 labels divided into six sectors and employs 120,000 people. The conglomerate raked in 30.6 billion euros in revenue in 2014 alone. The most profitable department of the company is Fashion and Leather Goods. It consists of 15 labels with 1,339 stores around the world. It grossed 10.83 billion euros in revenue in 2014.

Delphine Arnault, daughter of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, leads this most profitable department, overseeing brands such as Céline, Christian Dior, Loewe, and Louis Vuitton, to name just a few. The 41-year-old joined the family business in 2001. She notably played a central role in bringing Phoebe Philo to Céline, Jonathan W. Anderson (also interviewed in 032c Issue #30) to Loewe, and Nicolas Ghesquière to Louis Vuitton. As the Executive Vice President of Vuitton, she works closely with the latter. She is also the patron of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, one of the conglomerate’s many philanthropic initiatives motivated by her father’s philosophy, “Innovation is more powerful when it springs from a preserved heritage.”

The eight finalists of the prize – who will face a jury featuring J.W. Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Humberto Leon, Carol Lim, Phoebe Philo, Riccardo Tisci, and Arnault herself – reveal the brand’s determination to scour the world for emerging talent:

AAlto (Finland)

Alyx (United States)

Brandon Maxwell (United States) Facetasm (Japan)

Koché (France)

Vejas (Canada)

Wales Bonner (United Kingdom) [Grace Wales Bonner was declared the winner in June 2016 – ed.]

Y/Project (Belgium)

When I meet Arnault, I notice she is tall and striking, almost intimidating in her glossy appearance. Born in Neuilly-sur- Seine just west of Paris in 1975, she graduated from the EDHEC Business School and the London School of Economics. She began her career at McKinsey & Company before joining the family business. When we meet she is wearing a Repossi ring and another ring from Victoire de Castellane, who designs jewellery for Dior. Her bracelet, top, skirt, and shoes are all Louis Vuitton. She wears a red nail-polish from Dior entitled, “Rouge Dior.”

This year, you celebrate the third edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers. What is the intention behind finding a newcomer every year?

DELPHINE ARNAULT: We think that, as the leader of our industry, it is our responsibility to identify young talents and help them grow. We have been doing that for many years, but in different ways, by hiring young designers within our group. We have always looked for young designers that we can support. But this initiative is to find the young talents that are out there in the world. The LVMH Prize is open to any nationality. It’s very democratic, since it is an open call. Anyone can apply. The only prerequisites are that you have to have done two collections and you have to be between 18 and 40 years of age. Womenswear, menswear, unisex-wear – it doesn’t matter. All you need is access to the Internet, as you can only apply online. This year, we received around 1,000 applications from all over the world. We even hosted, in the first round of 23 finalists, two sisters from Iran.

Please give me the job description of a fashion designer today.

What we are looking for is someone that has a unique point of view, a unique style. Someone who brings something new to fashion. A designer today also needs to be able to communicate on their work, to have a vision for their business. It is a multi-faceted job, really.

Above: An SSENSE video, made for the winner of the 2016 LVMH Prize, Grace Wales Bonner, directed by Jamie Morgan and art-directed by Wales Bonner.

Is it possible to bring something new to the table?

Yes, it is. When you see the designers, the ones that are really important for fashion today, they all have their own, unique style. Therefore, it’s new. But beyond uniqueness and talent, we are also looking for charisma. The finalists have to face the jury that is composed of designers from our group.

As much as I like the idea of the open call, I feel as though it’s a bad idea that it’s the designers deciding who will take their throne. How objective can they be in choosing the next king or queen?

But they already do that every day, in their studios. They have a lot of people working for them and they see designers all year long. They know what it takes. It was Nicolas who first pointed J.W. Anderson out to me and said, “Look at what he’s doing.” I think when you are such a big talent – like Nicolas, or like Karl –you also want to help the next generation. There is a lot of generosity. All our designers are very interested in the participants of the prize. They take their time and speak to each and every single one of them, even though they are busy and have their own shows coming up.

It’s not easy for all the young talents to face the jury. A bit like in the movie Flashdance, with Jennifer Beals. Imagine presenting your work to Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière, J.W. Anderson, Phoebe Philo, all your heroes, at the same time.

What I liked observing in the past is that the young talents don’t seemed too stressed. Also, it’s important for a young talent to understand that you have to be able to speak about your work. To speak to journalists, to TV, to the world. You have to be able to speak to an impressive audience.

Who in the fashion industry is in power today? The designer? The CEO? The stylist? The editor? The journalist, or the fashion critic? Or the consumer?

I think it is mostly the consumers. They are the ones who buy the products.

And within the brand, who is in charge? The creative director, or the CEO?

If you look at successful partnerships, or a company that is doing very well, it is often because of a close relationship between the designer and the CEO. They understand each other. They each have their own parameters in expertise. The designer works on the products and of course is aware of all the sales and what the market is requesting. You have to be aware and very much in tune with reality. The CEO has to manage a lot of behind-the-scenes things, from hiring the best teams to developing the business. Therefore, it’s important to find a good partnership. That’s when you get a really successful company in fashion.

Why do you love fashion?

Because I was raised in fashion.

But you could have rejected fashion.

It is hard to reject fashion. I was ten years old when my father bought Dior. So fashion is part of my life.

What impact would you like to generate? What is the philosophy behind your work?

I think – I hope – with this prize, for example, that it can help the career of many young designers. It can help them with the choices they make, give them more visibility. Even if they don’t win – because there can only be one winner – they get a great experience and a lot of visibility for their brand. Also, we motivate them to persevere. Even if they don’t win the first time, they can always re-apply next year. Jacquemus, for example, applied in the first year and he didn’t win. But he applied again the year after and won the special prize of the jury. In fashion, you have to be very persistent. Fashion is not a sprint, it’s a marathon.

That’s ironic, as lately the pace of fashion feels like a sprint.

Not for us. You need to take your time. We think long-term.

What is the most important lesson you learned from your father about fashion?

I have learned a lot of great lessons from him. He trusted me at a very young age. I started at Dior when I was 26. I was in charge of the shoes. I was managing the shoe business, working with the designers, making sure that the collection was good, that we didn’t just have 12-centimeter heels, but we also had flats and mid-heels.

I also went to the factories to work with the people in the factories and negotiate the prices. One thing my father taught me is that you have to look at the big picture, but at the same time at every little detail. In our business, every little detail counts. So when my father goes and visits the shops, which he does very often –

Dressed as himself?

Yes, dressed as himself.

Don’t the employees freeze when the big boss is coming?

No. They are really happy to see him. So when he goes to the shops, he pays attention to every detail. The way the bags are displayed, whether or not the light is properly directed. He has an amazing eye. Also, when we present the collections to him – before the shows and before they are released, we display all the bags on a table – he can see which bags will become a hit and a bestseller, and which won’t.

What makes a bag a bestseller?

That is complicated. It’ll last much longer than our interview slot to explain that.

Is he often right?

Yes, most of the time he is right.

What makes a bag a bestseller?

That is complicated. It’ll last much longer than our interview slot to explain that.

Who is the most inspiring person for you in the fashion industry today? And why?

My father inspires me a lot. He taught me so many things. The designers I work with are also very inspiring. I work most of my time on Louis Vuitton, so I spend a lot of time with Nicolas and his team.

Please explain your responsibilities at Louis Vuitton.

I supervise all the products at Louis Vuitton – the ready-to-wear, the bags, the shoes, the accessories, the scarves, et cetera – for womenswear and menswear, but more on the business side. I make sure we have all the right products for the different markets. Then I work on the pricing, the margins, the visual displays in the shops, all the development of the product, from first sketch until it arrives in the shops.

What is fashion about today? Did it change from the day your father bought Dior?

Yes, it changed. But changes are good, it’s normal. I think fashion is becoming very digital. Nowadays, when you go to fashion shows, you only see people with their iPhones. They are not even enjoying the moment, or the experience. It is something that has changed completely from my generation to the new generation. The kids of today are born with an iPhone in their hands.

So how does that affect your work? Especially since you said earlier that fashion is a marathon.

It is a marathon, but things go much faster. Everything is so immediate. Instagram is a total translation of the now. The fact that you can instantly see everything changes the way fashion communicates, but it should never change the quality of fashion.

Do you read fashion magazines, or newspapers? Which medium corresponds to your vision of the future of fashion?

Instagram is an amazing vehicle. It is quick. It is very visual. It is perfect for fashion. I also like Snapchat.

Paris has changed. Europe is changing. Society is changing. Demands and needs are shifting. Fashion used to mirror the present, but today the industry remains unaffected. Is fashion blind towards reality? I feel it is disconnected.

I think fashion is in touch with reality, but fashion also has to make you dream. It is part of what we do: to make people dream.

As one of the biggest industries in the world, what responsibility does fashion have today?

One of our responsibilities is the LVMH Prize. We also have a responsibility to help people grow, not only in the design fields, but in every other aspect of the business. We invest a lot of time mentoring men and women, spotting talents and making them grow. Not only on the creative side, but also on the business side.

The transaction’s total values will clock in at $650 million with customary adjustments at closing. The deal is expected to be done by the end of 2016 or by early 2017.

This marks the second big sale in LVMH’s nearly 30-year history, the first being the sale of Christian Lacroix in 2005. LVMH shares rose about 1 percent on the deal’s announcement. This caps of a sometimes uneasy partnership – Donna Karan has publicly complained about LVMH’s stewardship of her brand since she retired officially last year. LVMH, on the other hand, reports they have actively looked for ways to revive the brand, mostly to no avail.

Donna Karan’s move in recent years toward wholesale and away from her higher-priced apparel has left the brand out of step with its luxury focused parent. LVMH did away with the high-end Donna Karan line, focusing all its efforts on the lower-price DKNY brand. The luxury giant also disbanded lines like DK Jeans and DKNYC during the process.

G-III Apparel Group manufacturers and distributes of apparel and accessories under licensed, owned, and private label brands. Famous names on that list are Marc New York, Bass, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s and Dockers.

“Donna Karan International is an iconic global fashion company. Its lifestyle aesthetic resonates well with consumers throughout the world,” G-III president/CEO Morris Goldfarb said in a statement. “We are excited to build upon its strong foundation as we seek to capitalize on a significant market opportunity. Donna Karan brings increased scale and diversification, while providing incremental growth on top of our portfolio of some of the best fashion brands in the world.”

PARIS (AP) — French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is selling its Donna Karan and DKNY clothing brands to U.S. group G-III Apparel in a $650 million deal.

It’s a rare sale for LVMH, owner of such brands as Christian Dior, Kenzo and Sephora and a leader in the luxury world.

According to the transaction announced Monday, G-III will acquire Donna Karan International, Inc., in late 2016 or early 2017.

New York-based G-III owns brands including Bass shoes and Vilebrequin clothing, and has licenses with U.S. sports leagues. It’s looking to expand its brands, and will fund the purchase with loans, according to a statement from LVMH.

The timing and the terms under which the reshuffle would happen have not yet been determined, the sources said. However, they added the matter was being actively discussed at LVMH. LVMH declined to comment when contacted before publication. Later, LVMH denied the ""erroneous information that Nicolas Ghesquiere might soon leave as artistic director of Louis Vuitton"". Ghesquiere's contract is not due for renewal until the end of 2018, a spokesman said. Louis Vuitton is the world's biggest luxury brand, generating nearly 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in annual revenue and accounts for the bulk of profit at parent LVMH, owner of 70 luxury brands and businesses, ranging from fashion and wine to jewelry and hotels. ""People in the studio are expecting him (Ghesquiere) to leave, possibly as early as after the October collection,"" one of the sources said. Ghesquiere, 45, told French TV channel Canal Plus in early June that we wished to create his own label and would be in a position to do it very soon but he did not provide details. Designers at big brands including Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga and Hermes - Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang and Christophe Lemaire, respectively - have left in recent years to develop their own labels. ARNAULT 'ADORES' ANDERSON The sources said Arnault and his daughter Delphine, No.2 at Louis Vuitton, were big fans of 32-year-old Anderson, known for his playful designs and contemporary art inspiration. They said executives at LVMH believed Louis Vuitton would give him a bigger platform to express his talent. LVMH recruited the prize-winning Northern Irish designer in 2013 after taking a minority stake in his brand J.W. Anderson. ""Arnault is very fond of Anderson, everybody knows he adores him,"" a second source said. ""As of now, he is the best positioned to replace Ghesquiere."" The luxury goods industry downturn has prompted a series of high-profile management and designer reshuffles, aimed at giving brands a creative and strategy reboot to perk up their sales. Burberry last week poached Celine's boss Marco Gobbetti to be its new chief executive, becoming the latest major luxury label to announce leadership changes after Dior, Chanel, Cartier, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Lanvin. Ghesquiere worked at Balenciaga before joining Louis Vuitton. By October, he will have been at the French label for three years. Three years has become the standard length of time for designers to stay at a fashion label, though there it no set formula as some have worked at brands for more than a decade. It is possible that Ghesquiere may not leave Louis Vuitton until next year as his departure is likely to be a lengthy, complex and delicate matter to negotiate and plan internally, the sources said. ""It is a sensitive issue which could take time to solve,"" a third source said. Ghesquiere's razor-sharp modern style has played out well at Louis Vuitton's core leather goods business for which he created a popular new range of handbags and the ""V"" logo. However, his experimental, warrior-style silhouettes in ready-to-wear has not yet lived up to commercial expectations, several sources said. LVMH, due to publish half-year results on July 26, does not disclose separate sales figures for any of its brands.

LVMH has owned DKNY and Donna Karan International since 2001. It shelved the mainline DKI after Donna Karan stepped away from the business in 2015 to focus on her lifestyle business Urban Zen.

Public School designers Maxwell Osbourne and Dao Yi Chow were installed to head up the younger DKNY brand but, according to a report in the New York Post, sales have been disappointing.

An unnamed source told the US newspaper that LVMH has a particular American buyer in mind for DKNY and is not putting the opportunity out to purchase the brand to the wider market.

“The word is that they have a buyer in mind and have approached a US company to buy the brand, but it is not yet clear if the deal is going forward,” the source said.

LVHM owns a raft of luxury brands in fashion including flagship brand Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Loewe, Fendi and Nicholas Kirkwood. Yesterday it denied rumours that Nicolas Ghesquiere was to be replaced as creative director at Louis Vuitton by Jonathan Anderson who heads up Loewe and his own label JW Anderson.

Donna Karan started her label in 1985 designing clothes for her friends. She went on to become one of the era's most important designers producing clothes that addressed the needs of modern women, in particular her ""seven easy pieces"" line. She was perhaps most famous for her ""cold shoulder"" dresses and tops, which have been rediscovered by fashion and have been a key look of Spring/Summer 16.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9991499185562134}",negative,0.9991499185562134,-1

NEW YORK – Where there's smoke, there's fire.

Last week, it was reported that DKNY, the fashion brand under LVMH since 2000, was being sold off.

Now, DKNY has confirmed that it's been sold to G-III Apparel Group for $650 million, which owns brands like the resort-centric apparel line Vilebrequin and Bass shoes.

""We believe the DKNY brand has a dynamic position in the market, and when G-III approached us about acquiring the brand, we concluded that the time was right and that G-III was the right steward going forward,"" said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, home to Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Kenzo and other stellar fashion companies, said in a Monday release.

After years of underwhelming sales and extensive changes to the brand, DKNY had attempted to turn itself around last year by hiring Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne of the brand Public School. That came after the departure of Donna Karan from her own brand, and DKNY's creative director Jane Chung, who breathed life into the brand from the beginning.

Karan had launched DKNY in fall of 1985 as a women's collection called Seven Easy Pieces that could translate easily from day to night. It was revolutionary at the time -- women could wear something to work and then at night without breaking a sweat.

The brand was highly profitable. So much so, in 2000, the brand along with Donna Karan's mainstay line, sold to LVMH for $450 million.

But then in 2015, Karan was out, saying she wanted to focus on charity and her Urban Zen brand. Shortly after, two other major forces left including Patti Cohen, Karan's longtime publicist, and Aliza Licht, DKNY's SVP of global communications, who was best known as @DKNYPRGirl.

The company swiftly brought in Hector Muelas, formerly of Apple, as its creative director of digital. Sources say Muelas was a polarizing force and was ""difficult to work with."" The executive didn't last long and resigned in March.

That left Chow and Osborne at a huge disadvantage coming into the new gig. And with so many changes, nothing felt truly stable. The two were brought in to overturn the brand and revamp its aesthetic entirely, up against many obstacles and odds.

First up was a resurrection of its social channels to better suit the new vision of the brand. Gone was the inside look and friendly attitude Licht built for years. Behind-the-scenes photos were replaced with stark, black and white images of models in urban settings.

The theme wasn't discriminatory when it came to apparel. DKNY's new direction was a 180-degree change from its previous generations. Long gone were jewel-toned dresses, and sporty yet feminine chic frocks that attracted mall shoppers to young women. The brand that made the approachable Cozy Wrap was unrecognizable with Chow and Osborne's vision. It was replaced with a downtown, minimal vibe that looked more Public School than mass market brand that DKNY became synonymous with.

The two designers' first collection with the brand was Spring 2016, and showcased menswear-inspired looks from oversized pinstripe blazers, to masculine shirt-dresses. Its latest for Spring 2017 was an amalgamation of 90's-inspire dresses. Slouchy slip dresses, trousers, made for a cool, modern aesthetic.

But that new direction, as it turned out, also confused and alienated loyal customers.

With so much change, can DKNY overturn into a profitable company? The brand has an extensive history, for sure, and has a massive social following. Its Facebook page has close to 2 million likes. There's also social and cool cachet, with Chow and Osborne still part of the downtown set.

But what DKNY now needs is enough cool, more mass market appeal. The brand no longer has the luxury of being under LVMH. It now must meet expectations under a more mass market company like G-III Apparel Group, one that houses brands like Vince Camuto, Jones New York, Ellen Tracy, among others.

The new goal: Figuring out how to make cool mainstream, an oxymoron on its own.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999903440475464}",neutral,0.9999903440475464,0

Citing three sources, Reuters suggested Nicolas Ghesquière, Louis Vuitton’s creative director of women’s collection, could be unseated as soon as after Paris Fashion Week, scheduled for Sept. 27 to Oct. 5.

The news agency identified Loewe’s creative director, Jonathan Anderson, as the most likely heir apparent.

Ghesquière, who joined the French fashion house in November 2013 after catapulting Balenciaga to the forefront of the Paris fashion agenda, has approximately two years left on his current contract and there are no discussions to replace him, a Paris source told WWD.

It is understood that Louis Vuitton has been reconfiguring teams around Ghesquière, and is fine-tuning assortments, but that it is largely satisfied with the progress of the brand under his creative leadership.

Known for his exacting, couturelike approach, Ghesquière is seen adding Louis Vuitton in its quest to build a more upscale and elite reputation after years of rapid global expansion and a heavy reliance on monogram canvas.

The brand’s parent, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is to report its second-quarter sales on July 26.

Rogerio Fujimori, luxury analyst at RBC Capital markets, said he anticipates “relative resilience” from the luxury giant.

“We expect Moët Hennessy and Sephora to stand out in Q2 and offset a tricky quarter for fashion and leather goods,” which the bank forecasts to show a 1 percent sales decline.

“We still model 4 percent organic growth and [estimate] 6.9 billion euros of group [earnings before interest and taxes] in full-year 2016,” Fujiwara noted in a research note.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999843835830688}",neutral,0.9999843835830688,0
What's Driving the Goldrush for Korean Beauty Brands? - The Business of Fashion,"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iZWF1dHkvc291dGgta29yZWFuLWJlYXV0eS1icmFuZHMtZ29sZHJ1c2gtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1jYXJ2ZXItbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEOUL, South Korea — LVMH has bought a minority stake in Clio Cosmetics for $50 million, in a deal valuing the Korean company at $700 million, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal late last week.

The deal is the second major investment in South Korea’s booming beauty industry last week, highlighting growing interest among Western companies. Earlier in the week, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital Private Equity said they had acquired a controlling stake in specialty cosmetics firm Carver Korea, in a deal that values that company at about $675 million.

Demand for Korean beauty products is exploding. Last year, the country exported more than $2.64 billion of cosmetic goods between January and November, a new record high, according to the Korea Customs Service. Beauty exports from Korea have been growing rapidly, from $1 billion in 2012 to $1.3 billion in 2013 and $1.9 billion in 2014.

Indeed, the French luxury conglomerate’s move will come as little surprise to those closely watching the Korean beauty sector, which is renowned for creating trends and product innovations years ahead of their Western counterparts. From introducing unusual ingredients like snail mucus and bee venom to the market, to developing new application techniques like sheet masks and cushion compacts, Korean beauty companies have been at the forefront of beauty innovation for years, driven in part by the expectations of sophisticated local customers.

South Korean women — for whom flawless skin is the ultimate beauty ideal — are reported to spend twice as much of their income on beauty and make-up products than their American counterparts, with the average Korean skincare regime consisting of at least 10 steps. The beauty industry in South Korea was valued at $11.6 billion last year, and is expected to grow to $13.1 billion by 2020, according to Euromonitor.

“Large companies like LVMH are attracted to Korean beauty because its formula is clearly profitable, yet there is still a way to go to globalise the phenomenon,” said Hannah Symons, Beauty and Personal Care Associate at Euromonitor. Many Korean brands have failed to capture key markets outside of Asia, such as Western Europe and the United States, paving the way for international players to leverage their global reach to claim a stake in these prospective white spaces.

“South Korean beauty has a strategy of extreme segmentation, which provides constant opportunities for innovation in terms of packaging, ingredients, formats and textures,” said Symons. “These companies excel at creating needs that maybe consumers wouldn’t have thought of and then satisfying the need with exciting and novel products. This approach of short product development cycles provides ample opportunities for growth.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992812275886536}",neutral,0.9992812275886536,0

After selling off Christian Lacroix in 2005, a brand that the conglomerate acquired in ’87, but suffered losses every year since its beginning, the French firm is releasing Donna Karan International into the hands of G-III. That number is only $7 million more than what LVMH paid for the brand back in 2001. While for some this might seem like just a step in a long, drawn out closure of the company, if G-III’s outlook is indication, it’s the start of a golden era.

In a conference call held this morning, G-III laid out big plans for Donna Karan International which stands as its biggest purchase to date. The debt the company took on to pay for the acquisition will see them paying out to lenders for six and a half years. But if their projections are correct, accomplishing that should prove easy. In just three years, G-III CEO Morris Goldfarb, who also owns licenses for companies like Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld, plans to double DKI’s revenue to $700 million through expanded categories and licensing agreements according to Fashionista. Amongst those expanded categories under the DKNY brand, one could expect footwear, handbags, intimates, childrenswear, menswear and even a resurrection of DKNY jeans and DKNYC.

That news might sound like an episode of the twilight zone for the brand’s founder and namesake, Donna Karan herself. In a controversial interview back in 2014, Karan famously said “Vuitton has given me the cold shoulder.” She called the conglomerate out for not capitalizing on the company’s handbag business and pigeon-holing her into apparel. Now, the company will get that focus, though Karan has already departed.

Goldfarb also plans to bring back the Donna Karan label as well. The team has a “plan to relaunch very quickly” and that category still sit in the luxury arena, as it did before the founder of the brand retired and the label was shelved. But who will run it?

As of now, Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow, the pair who made their name with the elevated, contemporary basics line Public School are the only head designers at DKI, churning out the designs for DKNY. Their lack of experience with women’s eveningwear doesn’t seem on par with an aggressive relaunch of the high-end Donna Karan label. Will they be replaced? Will Donna be brought back into the brand to work the high-end while they continue to inject the cool with the diffusion label? Has this whole purchase been some sort of Peter Thiel-level plan for Karan to get her company back? It would be a fashion coup if there ever was one.

But with the constant turnover in the industry that sees Alber Elbaz without a role, Oscar de la Renta in need of a creative director and Raf Simons reportedly waiting in the wings at Calvin Klein, one has to wonder what this recent multi-million-dollar deal means for things. We know one thing: Hedi Slimane isn’t worried about it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991669654846191}",neutral,0.9991669654846191,0

The sale comes just over a year after a new design team had been put in place, showing how little patience LVMH has for underperforming businesses in the current tough trading environment.

Analysts estimate DKNY’s annual sales at $450 million to $500 million, meaning G-III would be paying 1-1.5 times annual revenue, less than the 1.9 times LVMH paid when it bought the brand in 2001.

“Selling DKNY is a way to get rid of a problem, at a time when the market is tough and luxury companies would be right to show less leniency with underperforming businesses,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca.

Founded in 1984 by Donna Karan, the label came to define the professional working woman’s wardrobe with its sleek and sophisticated mix and match pieces. The designer expanded the Donna Karan New York brand by creating a less expensive clothing line for younger women called DKNY.

Over time, the Donna Karan brand lost touch with its customers as its brightly patterned African-inspired designs confused an identity based on jersey dresses, bodysuits and wrap skirts, fashion editors said.

And sister label DKNY struggled to compete with so-called accessible luxury brands Michael Kors and Tory Burch and edgier New York newcomers such as Alexander Wang.

LVMH publishes first-half figures today, which analysts expect will provide further evidence of the slowdown affecting the global luxury goods industry, caused in part by lower tourist spending in Europe following militant attacks.

The luxury conglomerate also faces pressure to turn around Marc Jacobs, which has seen its sales dive in the past two years. Analysts estimate Marc Jacobs makes even bigger losses than DKNY.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9469286799430847}",negative,0.9469286799430847,-1
