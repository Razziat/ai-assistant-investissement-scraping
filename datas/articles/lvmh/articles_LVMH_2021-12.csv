Stock of the Week: LVMH - Morningstar,"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdzdGFyLmNvLnVrL3VrL25ld3MvMjE3NDc5L3N0b2NrLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWx2bWguYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Our latest stock of the week poll had a luxury theme, loosely tied to a certain film currently showing in cinemas. Our Twitter followers overwhelmingly voted in favour of LVMH, the French fashion house behind Louis Vuitton, ahead of Prada, Burberry and Hermes.

LVMH (MC) is an acronym for a slightly more unwieldy title: Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. And while the name is a combination of some of its most famous brands, Louis Vuitton, champagne maker Moët & Chandon and cognac firm Hennessey, the wider group controls 60 companies and 75 brands.

How has LVMH become the most valuable company in Europe since floating? While LVMH became a publicly listed entity in 1990, a decent chunk of its shares are held by founder Bernard Arnault, now one of the richest people in the world after making his dream of a luxury conglomerate into a reality. Fund manager Nick Train, who owns shares in LVHM, is a fan of Arnault’s single-minded focus an investor.

Train describes Arnault as the ultimate value investor with an impeccable sense of timing.

“Every so often on those rare opportunities when it’s been possible to acquire one of these vanishingly rare luxury brands, he has leapt and snapped them up. And I have to say as a portfolio manager, would that our record had been as good. But there are lessons to be learned from where he apprehends value.”

One recent example is the protracted battle for luxury New York jeweller Tiffany, which LVMH bought for nearly $16 billion last year, a discount to the original price.

While some investors may balk at backing companies where founders retain controlling stakes, the track record of the company speaks for itself: excluding dividends, the shares have returned nearly 3,500% since they floated.

Indeed, looking at the share price chart, it’s hard to see the impact of seismic events like the financial crisis, birth of e-commerce and coronavirus. Granted, there was a dip in the 2020 sell-off, but LVMH’s shares have doubled since. The conventional narrative is that lockdowns have given people more money to spend on luxury after the initial shock subsided, and that the stock market has brutally sorted the “winners” from the “losers” among public companies. This explains the rich valuations of companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).

LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division (its most profitable) saw sales 38% higher than in the same period of 2019, which suggests that at least some of that spare pandemic cash is making its way into LVMH brands. There are several reasons why luxury has been so buoyant, explains Morningstar luxury analyst Jelena Sokolova.

“One is very resilient luxury consumer incomes. The second is the wealth effect. So, the stock markets recovered sharply. The real estate markets were quite resilient. And then, also, people couldn't spend as much as they usually do on travel or on experiences, all those things that were actually most affected by the lockdowns. So, that left them with extra savings. And finally, last but not least, psychologically people need to reward themselves after moments of stress.”

Like recent stock of the week Ferrari, LVMH is one of the 154 companies rated by Morningstar as some of the most overvalued in the world. Granted, LVMH’s premium pricing and luxury brands mean it is granted a wide economic moat, as Sokolova explains.

“We believe that a portfolio of strong leading brands in several luxury niches grants LVMH a wide moat and should allow it to generate economic profits well into the future. In fashion and leather goods (over half of the company’s profits), LVMH’s brand intangible assets are backed by the 100-plus-year-old globally-recognised Louis Vuitton brand, with long product cycles and fully controlled distribution, as well as several smaller but still iconic brands, including Fendi and Loro Piano.”

After recent strong third-quarter results, Morningstar upped its fair value estimate for LVMH to €394, but that is still far below its current price of more than €700. Can LVMH’s strong run continue? Sokolova says the current share price implies the market assumes double-digit growth in Louis Vuitton will continue, which she says is over-optimistic. Beijing’s battle with its super rich is one example of why the turbocharged growth narrative for the luxury sector may be slow to materialise. In this sector, she prefers 3-star rated Swatch Group (UHR) to overvalued brands like LVMH."
French luxury group LVMH to pay €10 million to settle spying claims - FRANCE 24 English,"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9mcmFuY2UvMjAyMTEyMTctZnJlbmNoLWx1eHVyeS1ncm91cC1sdm1oLXRvLXBheS0xMC1taWxsaW9uLWV1cm9zLXRvLXNldHRsZS1zcHlpbmctY2xhaW1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French luxury behemoth LVMH will pay 10 million euros ($11.3 million) to settle claims that it hired France's former domestic intelligence chief to spy on private citizens, in particular on a filmmaker who made a widely popular documentary targeting the group's CEO.

LVMH will pay 10 million euros to settle claims that it hired France's former domestic intelligence chief to spy on private citizens.

A Paris court on Friday validated the settlement offered by prosecutors, ending an inquiry opened in 2011 against the fashion conglomerate controlled by Bernard Arnault, the world's third-richest person according to Forbes magazine.

The ruling infuriated François Ruffin, a journalist, filmmaker and now leftwing politician who made headlines in 2016 with ""Merci Patron!"" (Thanks Boss!), a film that skewered Arnault as a heartless tycoon impoverishing the French working class.

Ruffin filed a lawsuit in 2019 claiming that LVMH contracted the former head of France's DGSI domestic intelligence agency, Bernard Squarcini, to spy on him for nearly three years while filming the movie, which won a Cesar – France's equivalent of the Oscars – as best documentary in 2017.

The film recounts the David-versus-Goliath travails of Jocelyne and Serge Klur, two former textile employees who were among dozens laid off by one of LVMH's subcontractors after their work was outsourced to Poland.

It became a hit with audiences who cheered the couple as they attempt to make Arnault fork over the money to save their home and land Serge a full-time job.

Ruffin had urged the court to refuse the settlement, saying 10 million euros was just 0.02 percent of the nearly 45 billion euros in revenue last year for LVMH, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy and the Sephora cosmetics chain.

""Can justice be bought so cheaply? The answer is yes,"" Ruffin told journalists after the hearing Friday.

""It's a blank check for all future spying operations by multinationals. All LVMH had to do was pay to get out of the proceedings,"" he said.

The vice-president of the Paris court, Caroline Viguier, said the settlement took into account LVMH's ""cooperation"" in the inquiry and ""its efforts to prevent any repeat of such incidents"".

""There is no institutionalised system [for spying] in place within LVMH and the group accepts its responsibilities, including with regards to the failings that took place,"" the company's legal director Jerome Sibille told the court.

Kering and LVMH Respond to PETA's Allegations in Asia - WWD,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2tlcmluZy1hbmQtbHZtaC1yZXNwb25kLXRvLXBldGFzLWFsbGVnYXRpb25zLWluLWFzaWEtMTIzNTAyMDA5MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After lobbying and swaying many fashion brands to stop using fur, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has increased its efforts to get companies to stop using exotic skins.

Following a recent PETA Asia investigation, the organization has appealed to top executives at Kering and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. In letters dated Monday to Kering’s chair and chief executive officer François-Henri Pinault and LVMH’s chair and CEO Bernard Arnault, PETA’s president Ingrid Newkirk urged them to stop using exotic animal skins.

The letter to Pinault opened with thanks for declaring Kering fur-free. It went on to detail the “violent, inarguably cruel manner” in which lizards are killed for Gucci accessories, based on a PETA Asia investigation. “No bag, belt or wallet is worth such pain and suffering, especially since your designers have access to the most advanced and beautiful leathers,” Newkirk wrote.

In the letter to Arnault, PETA claimed that workers in slaughterhouses that supply LVMH inflated pythons, among other allegations of “indefensible suffering.” Newkirk also referred to a previous claim of “thousands” of crocodiles being crammed into a confined space “for months” in part of LVMH’s supply chain in Vietnam.

However, other experts who have seen the PETA video, who requested anonymity, said that the practices shown seemed to comply with international animal welfare standards overall.

Both companies responded to the allegations Thursday and highlighted their commitments to traceability and standards for animal welfare.

Kering said in a statement provided to WWD Thursday: “Kering has always been committed to respecting the highest standards of animal welfare, sustainability and labor conditions in its sourcing of precious skins. Kering is also engaged with several industry associations to help suppliers improve their practices. With respect to precious skins, Kering is committed to a goal of 100 percent traceability and strict adherence to the Kering standards for raw materials sourcing and manufacturing processes by 2025.”

Addressing the allegations more directly, the Kering statement noted that, “As for the information regarding the mistreatment of lizards in an Indonesian processing facility that was brought to us by PETA, while we have taken these allegations very seriously, there is no evidence that Kering brands are directly or indirectly connected with this facility or those practices.”

The Kering statement noted that such practices are “strictly forbidden” by the company’s animal welfare standards. The company said that it launched an internal investigation as soon as it was notified. That said, “should there be a proven connection between this facility and our supply chain, we would immediately terminate the business relationship. We’re committed to continuously enhance traceability and animal welfare in our supply chains,” the statement read.

In a statement issued by a spokesperson for LVMH, the company indicated that it “respects all views and sensitivities on the use of animal-based raw materials and we support and are actively involved in the sector’s efforts to achieve the best possible practices.”

The statement continued, “Our intention is to provide customers with a product that has been made in the most responsible and ethical manner possible.”

LVMH cited its 28-year commitment to applying the highest standards in the sourcing of these materials, prioritizing animal welfare, conservation of species and utmost respect for the environment and local communities.

The information provided by the spokesperson also noted that LVMH introduced an animal-based raw materials sourcing charter in 2019 to assess the aforementioned commitments as they apply to all of its brands.

Furthermore, to ensure its designers “are free to use the raw materials that allow them to express their vision,” LVMH is “firmly committed to materials traceability” as stated in its “LIFE 360” environmental roadmap for all animal-based materials from 2025. That initiative was announced in April.

In recent years, companies like Chanel and Alexandre Birman have banned the use of exotic skins. Nordstrom has committed to doing away with them, too, as well as real fur by the end of this year.

The spokesperson for LVMH declined to say whether the company executives are considering no longer using exotic skins or whether they plan to speak with PETA officials.

A PETA spokeswoman said Thursday that the organization had not received a response from Kering or LVMH. PETA is planning protests in different cities, starting next week in Las Vegas, she said."
LVMH Revealed as Buyer of Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel - The Real Deal,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjEvMTIvMTYvbHZtaC1ib29rcy1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1ob3RlbC1mb3ItMjAwbS1zb3VyY2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s the four-letter word that every seller on Rodeo Drive loves to hear: LVMH.

The Paris-based luxury conglomerate, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co, Fendi and other brands, bought the former 86-key Luxe hotel on Rodeo Drive from the Harkham family for $200 million, sources familiar with the transaction told The Real Deal. JLL announced the sale yesterday, but did not disclose the buyer or the price. LVMH did not respond to a request for comment. Newmark’s Jay Luchs represented the buyer on the deal.

The sale, at around $2.3 million per room, is one of the largest ever in terms of a per key price in California, according to Alan Reay, the president of brokerage firm Atlas Hospitality Group, which was not involved in the deal. The price was slightly less on a per-key basis than Host Hotels & Resorts’ $148 million purchase of the 59-key Alila Ventana hotel in Big Sur earlier this year — around $2.5 million per room.

The 42,560-square-foot property also includes three high-end retail storefronts leased to Rolex, Patek Philppe and Ferrari.

It’s unclear whether LVMH is planning to keep the hotel intact, seek new tenants for the stores or switch uses for the retail space.

It’s also unclear how the acquisition of the Luxe might affect plans LVMH has just a block north at 468 North Rodeo Drive, where it is planning to build a nine-story hotel under its Cheval Blanc brand. Formerly a Brooks Brothers store, LVMH bought the site for $245 million in 2018, records show. In 2020, the firm bought a 6,000-square-foot adjacent property at 449 North Rodeo Drive for $30 million.

Last year, Beverly Hills-based hotelier Efram Harkham permanently shut the 86-key boutique hotel on the site. At the time, his son Aron Harkham said that the property got “caught up with the bad timing of the global travel market,” by remodeling just before the pandemic hit.

The Harkham family had owned the property since the 1990s.

LVMH’s deal also provides evidence that the pandemic hasn’t paused all high-end luxury retail activity. Last year, a partnership between Crown Equity and Ascendant Capital Partners sold a 11,600-square-foot retail property at 457-459 Rodeo Drive for $122 million — around $10,500 a foot."
LVMH Takes Full Control of Eyewear Manufacturer Thélios - WWD,"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy1uZXdzL2V5ZXdlYXIvbHZtaC10YWtlcy1mdWxsLWNvbnRyb2wtZXlld2Vhci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXItdGhlbGlvcy0xMjM1MDE1NTk4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is taking full control of eyewear manufacturer Thélios.

The French luxury conglomerate has agreed to purchase Marcolin’s 49 percent stake in Thélios for an undisclosed sum. Separately, Marcolin will buy back the 10 percent stake LVMH owns in that Italian company, which the former acquired when Thélios was founded in 2017.

The step will allow LVMH to further strengthen its presence in the eyewear industry leveraging on Thélios’ expertise and Marcolin to pursue future strategic investments.

Thélios produces for Dior, Fendi, Celine, Loewe, Stella McCartney, Kenzo, Fred, Berluti and Rimowa.

As reported in September, Givenchy is the latest LVMH brand to join the Thélios portfolio, beginning in January.

Thélios began operating in 2018, a joint venture between LVMH, which at the time had a 51 percent stake, with Marcolin owning the remainder. When the agreement was revealed, LVMH bought a 10 percent stake in Marcolin.

The year 2021 has seen the arrival of Dior in January, and Fendi in July, bowing for fall 2021. The general consensus is that Thélios will gradually produce eyewear collections for most if not all the brands under the LVMH umbrella. Thélios also partly produces for Louis Vuitton, whose eyewear is sold only through its own boutiques. Thélios employs 800 people, with 600 of them in Italy, and production spans more than 194,400 square feet. The state-of-the-art plant in Longarone, a one-hour drive from Venice, was inaugurated in 2018. Its former chief executive officer Giovanni Zoppas exited in May to join Tecnica Group, which specializes in outdoor footwear and ski equipment, and a successor has not been named yet.

Founded in 1961 and based in Longarone — in Italy’s Veneto region known for being an eyewear manufacturing hub — Marcolin designs, produces and distributes eyewear collections for a number of licensed brands, including Tom Ford, Guess, Adidas Originals, Bally, Moncler, Max Mara, GCDS, Tod’s, Emilio Pucci and Timberland, among others. Additionally, the firm’s portfolio includes house brands Web, Marcolin and Viva.

The company is helmed by CEO Fabrizio Curci, who joined in the summer of 2020, succeeding Massimo Renon. PAI Partners controls 74.7 percent of Marcolin."

Earlier this week, PETA released the findings of a recent investigation into an Indonesian slaughterhouse, which detailed the “violent, inarguably cruel manner” in which lizards are killed for Gucci accessories.

“The lizards’ legs are tied, then they’re callously thrown around and beheaded without stunning—causing them a prolonged, agonizing death,” the organization said in its report. “This kind of cruelty goes into every one of Gucci’s lizard leather purses, belts, wallets, and other fashion accessories.”

PETA President Ingrid Newkirk on Monday sent letters to the executives of Kering and LVMH, urging them to stop using exotic animal slims.

“No bag, belt or wallet is worth such pain and suffering, especially since your designers have access to the most advanced and beautiful leathers,” Newkirk wrote.

A Glimpse into Greed: Luxury Conglomerate Growth and Staying in the Family – The Flagler College Gargoyle - Flagler College Gargoyle,"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FyZ295bGUuZmxhZ2xlci5lZHUvMjAyMS8xMi9hLWdsaW1wc2UtaW50by1ncmVlZC1sdXh1cnktY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlLWdyb3d0aC1hbmQtc3RheWluZy1pbi10aGUtZmFtaWx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Julia Corrie

“I would rather weep in a Rolls-Royce than be happy on a bicycle.”

Patrizia Reggiani, the infamous ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci, was known for her expensive lifestyle and social status while a part of the Gucci family.

Upon the release of The House of Gucci on Nov. 24, History vs. Hollywood released an article detailing the plot of the film and how it compared to the historical truth.

When Rodolpho Gucci, Maurizio’s father, died in 1983, his brother Aldo battled with his nephew over the future of the company — keeping business traditional and in the family versus making deals with outside investors in order to increase revenue.

The Gucci family lost ownership of the company following the legal battle between Bernard Arnault’s Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) and François Pinault’s Pinault Printemps Redoute (now Kering) in the 1990s.

LVMH and Kering are two of the most successful luxury groups in the world. Their most notorious acquirements include Fendi, Givenchy, Bulgari, Gucci, and Puma to name a few.

Luxury groups are comparable to an umbrella with exorbitant clothing, cosmetics, accessories, home goods, and alcohol labels all protected underneath.

Like Gucci, many European namesake luxury brands such as Bulgari and Givenchy started with an immediate family and the manufacturing of high-quality goods. Between the 1990s and the early 2000s, LVMH made major investments to acquire 15 luxury fashion houses and cosmetic brands.

In the timeline linked above, almost every single brand states that it started as a family business venture, up until LVMH acquired it or purchased the majority of its stakes.

Louis Vuitton is the most famous example of the family business model, beginning with Vuitton himself in 1854.

Vuitton originally made his name by manufacturing sturdy, stackable leather trunks. The brand took on incredible domestic success in France, and only continued to spread after Vuitton’s death in 1892.

Louis’s son Georges and his grandson Gaston both followed in his footsteps, traveling around the world and creating worldwide buzz over the luggage. Gaston was the final male heir to the label’s ownership after George’s death in 1936.

Gaston’s daughter, Odile, eventually married a wealthy businessman in the steel industry named Henri Racamier, asking him to take control in 1977. From there, luxury fashion houses and goods manufacturers around the world gained exponential success.

Bernard Arnault, a french investor, had the idea to create a “luxury group” in the 1980s. Working alongside Alain Chevalier and Henri Racamier, the CEO of Moët Hennessy and then-president of Louis Vuitton, they formed LVMH.

As of 2021, over 75 luxury brands around the world have either been acquired by LVMH or have had a majority of their shares purchased by the conglomerate.

The inception of luxury groups into society was arguably one of the best business ventures one could’ve made. Especially in European countries where, in comparison to the United States, higher quality goods have a larger market.

Fendi, one of the most iconic italian fashion houses of all time, is an example of a label that was acquired by LVMH, while also reamining in the family. It was launched in 1926 by Adele and Edoardo Fendi, as a fur and leather bags brand. In 1946, their five daughters each took over 20% of the company’s ownership.

The label stayed under the total ownership of the Fendi family until 1999 when Prada and LVMH joined to buy 51% of its shares. Following this deal, Bernard Arnault and Patrizio Bertelli, the then-chairman of Prada and now CEO, took the reigns of leadership.

The difference between Fendi and other European fashion houses is there has always been a Fendi family member in a management position for the brand.

Bertelli married Miuccia Prada in 1978, after already developing a strong business relationship in the leather goods industry. He was running a leather factory, and at the time, Miuccia needed someone to manufacture her bags.

Miuccia had been working in the accessories department of the label since joining the family business in the mid-70s. As a fashion designer, she was able to launch her first successful handbag design in 1985. From there, she founded the subsidiary brand“Miu Miu,” modeled after her own wardrobe and long-time nickname.

Anna Gross of the Financial Times said “consolidation is central to success [of the luxury sector].” This was obviously true with the raging success of luxury umbrellas such as Kering and LVMH, which took in a total of ~57.7 billion euros in 2020, which was a slower year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

What’s interesting about the luxury industry is that each brand became more successful following the integration with conglomerates, ultimately making them more money. Less of the industry is dependent on customer sales, but more stakes and interest growth than anything else.

If a brand was to stay under the original family’s ownership, it would arguably not have as much of an opportunity for growth, whether that be financial or physical expansion around the world. Financial investors and international businesspeople are the ones that took all of these labels to new heights in the fashion world, and there is no sign of slowing down anytime soon."
"Are LVMH, Hermes outlets in Hainan the start of an exodus from Hong Kong? - Better Life","Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NoaW5hLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvMzE1NzkyNi9nbG9iYWwtbHV4dXJ5LWdpYW50cy1sdm1oLWhlcm1lcy1leWUtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWNoaW5hc9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NoaW5hLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvMzE1NzkyNi9nbG9iYWwtbHV4dXJ5LWdpYW50cy1sdm1oLWhlcm1lcy1leWUtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWNoaW5hcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Luxury brands will likely continue to increase investment into the mainland, especially Hainan, if people still don’t see much hope for the reopening of borders,” said Jonathan Yan, the Shanghai-based principal of consultancy Roland Berger. The impact on Hong Kong will be big, he added. “People from surrounding provinces, such as Guangdong, may continue to buy stuff in Hong Kong. But its total volume of mainland consumers will certainly drop.”

While LVMH and Hermes were eyeing new stores in the province, Richemont was investing more in Hainan and was planning to expand its local team, according to sources. Any pivot to Hainan will coincide with store closures in Hong Kong and could have a longer term impact on luxury retail in the city.

In a blow for Hong Kong, global luxury goods companies such as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), Hermes and Richemont are exploring opportunities in China’s Hainan province, as they eye expansion in the world’s second largest luxury market.

The exploration of opportunities in Hainan by luxury companies comes amid an increase in China’s importance to the sector during the coronavirus pandemic. The Chinese global luxury goods market accounted for 32 per cent of all global luxury goods sales last year, and was set to surpass the US to become the world’s largest in five years, according to Euromonitor International. In 2019, the country accounted for 11 per cent of all global luxury goods sales, according to data from Bain and Company.

Luxury companies, which recorded strong performances in the first three quarters of this year, were buoyed by demand from China. LVMH, which is the largest luxury brands group in the world and owns labels such as Celine, Givenchy and Christian Dior, saw organic sales of its fashion and leather goods surge 57 per cent in this period from a year earlier.

Hermes, which reported “a remarkable performance in Greater China and other countries in Asia”, said sales had jumped 63 per cent in Asia excluding Japan in the period. It also opened its 28th address in mainland China in September.

All products sold on Hainan Island will be duty free by 2025, but these luxury companies were unlikely to open such shops before that, contrary to a Reuters report . While Hermes and Richemont did not reply to requests for comment, LVMH said: “Louis Vuitton is exploring opportunities in Hainan. The house is not considering any options within the licensed duty-free market.”

Luxury companies might not open free-duty shops on Hainan Island as that could negatively impact their stores in other Chinese cities, said Roland Berger’s Yan.

Some luxury companies were opening new offices in the area under local preferential tax policies for foreign companies, as a way of getting more involved in fast-growing region, the sources said. Many had set up specific teams to monitor and study new opportunities, they added.

Richemont, which owns Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels and Piaget, has three job openings listed for Haikou, the province’s capital, on its website. Johann Rupert, its chairman, said during an investors call in May that he was confident that the investment in mainland China, including Hainan, “was worth it and it will become more apparent to everyone over the next two to three years”.

Hong Kong, an important shopping destination for mainland Chinese consumers until before the city’s social unrest and the pandemic, has suffered because of travel restrictions put in place by Beijing to contain and eradicate Covid-19. Louis Vuitton and Fendi, for example, closed their shops in the city’s Times Square shopping centre this year amid a slump in traffic and high rents.

And a drop in cross-border travel by Chinese consumers led to a 48 per cent surge in domestic sales of luxury products in 2020, Bain said in December last year. Preferential policies in Hainan, including an increase in duty-free shopping quotas for travellers to 100,000 yuan (US$15,697) annually from 30,000 yuan, have accelerated this trend.

China aims to establish a free-trade port policy system with a key focus on easing free trade and investment in Hainan by 2025, with the mechanism maturing by 2035. Its development, especially fast growth in consumption, is expected to further benefit from China’s “dual circulation economic strategy ”, which puts much emphasis on growth driven by the dominant role of the domestic market while also balancing its exports.

Bernard Arnault's Youngest Son Is Working at Louis Vuitton - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQteW91bmdlc3Qtc29uLXdvcmtpbmctMDYwMTE2MTcxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The youngest son of Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has followed his four siblings and joined the family-controlled luxury goods giant.

Jean Arnault quietly joined Louis Vuitton at the end of August as marketing and product development director, watches.

More from WWD

He is based at Vuitton’s headquarters in Paris, as well as at La Fabrique du Temps near Geneva, Switzerland, one of Vuitton’s watch production sites. He reports to Catherine Lacaze, director of watches and jewelry at Vuitton.

“Jean joins us following two successful assignments at Louis Vuitton, first at the Maison Champs-Élysées and then with the headquarters’ watches and jewelry department,” Lacaze wrote in an internal memo seen by WWD.

“In his new role with the watches team, he will be involved across the value chain, including defining strategy, steering product development and innovation, and retail launches,” she added.

Jean Arnault, 23, has a master’s degree in financial mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London after receiving a scientific baccalaureate with the highest honors from the prestigious private school Saint Louis de Gonzague-Franklin in Paris.

His LinkedIn profile lists summer internships as an investment banking analyst at investment firm Morgan Stanley; as an engineering intern at Formula 1 team McLaren Racing; and as a sales associate at Louis Vuitton.

The internal announcement notes that he has also applied his watchmaking knowledge at the Tag Heuer Research Institute.

Jean Arnault’s nearest sibling in age, Frédéric Arnault, another math and science whiz, is currently CEO of LVMH-owned watch brand Tag Heuer.

His eldest brother Antoine Arnault, currently CEO at Berluti and head of communications, image and environment for the French luxury group, also started his LVMH career at the Vuitton brand, first working in the marketing department and overseeing stores in the French provinces.

Story continues

Alexandre Arnault, currently executive vice president of products and communications at Tiffany & Co., started his LVMH career in 2015 as an investment manager, which led to the acquisition of German luggage-maker Rimowa.

Delphine Arnault, currently executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, started her career at McKinsey, the consulting firm, and joined LVMH in 2000, heading business development at John Galliano for a year before moving over to Dior as commercial director in 2001.

Jean Arnault teased his arrival at Vuitton’s watch division with an Instagram post of the entrance to La Fabrique du Temps, writing “New adventure starting!”

His feed suggests a love of animals, travel, nature, architecture, skiing and golfing.

‘Just never going to be OK’: report finds luxury brands falling behind on animal welfare - The Guardian,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi8yMDIxL2RlYy8wNi9qdXN0LW5ldmVyLWdvaW5nLXRvLWJlLW9rLXJlcG9ydC1maW5kcy1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLWZhbGxpbmctYmVoaW5kLW9uLWFuaW1hbC13ZWxmYXJl0gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjEvZGVjLzA2L2p1c3QtbmV2ZXItZ29pbmctdG8tYmUtb2stcmVwb3J0LWZpbmRzLWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZHMtZmFsbGluZy1iZWhpbmQtb24tYW5pbWFsLXdlbGZhcmU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite recent commitments from the luxury fashion industry to reduce its environmental footprint, a report has revealed luxury fashion brands are among the worst in the industry for animal welfare, driven by their continued use of fur and exotic animal skins.

As bans on the use of fur become more commonplace, the Animal Welfare in Fashion report highlights how out of step many luxury brands are with the rest of the industry.

Released on 6 December 2021 by global animal welfare organisation, Four Paws, the report assessed 111 brands across different markets, including Australia, on their commitment to animal welfare and sourcing transparency. While LVMH-owned Stella McCartney achieved the report’s highest score of 90%, the luxury sector fared the worst overall, receiving an average score of just 23% (lower than fast fashion at 53%).

The luxury sector’s attitude to fur changed significantly during 2021. In June Canada Goose stated they would stop using fur by 2022, in September, luxury conglomerate Kering announced all of its brands, including Gucci and Balenciaga, would stop using fur and the same month Oscar de la Renta also agreed to cease using fur, a move the New York Times reported was brokered by singer Billie Eilish. On 3 December, Elle magazine said fur would be banned from its editorial and advertising content.

The report found that 57% of brands assessed have a formal animal welfare policy, a figure that has almost doubled since the inaugural report was published last year.

The highest performing fashion category was – unsurprisingly – “sustainability”, with an average score of 76%; closely followed by brands in the “outdoor” category, with an average score of 71%. One Australian brand, streetwear label Afends, ranked in the report’s Top 10.

The report calls for brands to reduce the use of animal products, refine animal-based supply chain choices to encourage higher levels of welfare, and to replace animal products with sustainable alternatives.

The report drew on the Five Domains Model to assess brands, which was created by David Mellor, a professor of Animal Welfare Science at Massey University. The model measures welfare based on the animal’s mental state, which is affected by its nutrition, physical environment, health status and behavioural interactions.

The report shares its methodology with Good On You, a website that ranks fashion brands across three areas – people, planet and animals.

According to Good On You CEO, Gordon Renouf, to calculate each brand’s score on animal welfare, the platform rates brands based on publicly available information across five key areas: whether or not the brand has a welfare policy and how good this policy is; what materials they’re using and whether or not they’ve committed to banning exotic skins and fur; what certifications the brand is working with; how transparent and traceable their supply chain is; and how strong their governance model is.

They use these metrics to give each brand a score out of 100, which results in a rating of: “great”; “good”; “it’s a start”; “not good enough” and “we avoid”.

Seven luxury brands received a score of 0% and the lowest brand ratings, including Hermès, Prada and LVMH-owned Fendi, Louis Vuitton and Dior.

[Wild] animals are inherently difficult to farm in such a way that you can ensure a good level of animal welfare Jessica Medcalf, Four Paws

According to the report, a rating this low is reserved for brands that have little transparency about their position on animal welfare, have not taken any steps to address animal welfare and may be using fur, exotic skins, and angora.

“A few position statements just doesn’t cut it,” says Four Paws global corporate engagement manager, Jessica Medcalf. “We’re looking for comprehensive animal welfare policies that lead to impact on the ground.”

Four Paws informed each brand they were being assessed, told them how they had scored and provided some insight into where they could improve via email. Though the report indicates broad factors that contribute to a low or high score, it did not publish specific details about what led to the failing scores of each individual brand.

The report also noted that some brands with a score of 0% do have policies around animal welfare and certified sourcing – this is the case for the LVMH-owned brands. Others, such as Prada have committed to being fur free.

“Not all the worst performing brands are exactly the same. They all have different attributes,” says Medcalf.

‘Much can be learned from brands that are improving’

Medcalf says they have not received a response from the companies that scored negatively in the report, but she is hopeful “we will get to work together to improve their standards of animal welfare”.

For all low performing brands, the continued use of “unacceptable” animal products had “the most adverse impact on their scores”.

Medcalf says the report’s criteria are impossible to meet when wild animals like crocodiles or snakes are bred, caged and killed on farms. She says, “these animals are inherently difficult to farm in such a way that you can ensure a good level of animal welfare”.

According to Medcalf, Hermès – billed as the lowest performer – received their rating because they “use the largest array of animal products in our entire sample of 111 brands” and for “their use of products made from wildlife who have been farmed”.

A spokesperson for Hermès said they have “science-based animal welfare policies and a commitment to converge by 2024 toward best-in-class certification” and can ensure strict control of the supply chain, in particular the traceability of leather materials.

On their use of crocodile leather – some of which is sourced from Australian farms owned by the brand – the spokesperson said, “regarding exotic skins, Hermès has been collaborating with ICFA (International Crocodilian Farmers Association) for several years now”.

On its website, Hermès outlines a plan to create the first specific standards for supply chains for alligator, crocodile and ostrich skins. However Medcalf says “we don’t believe that the crocodile industry can ever ensure a good level of animal welfare”.

She says this is the case for all non-domesticated animals. “They’re wild animals, used to far-ranging conditions”. This means a farm environment is “just never going to be OK”.

When it comes to domesticated animals, the report places emphasis on the importance of certifications in promoting animal welfare. Medcalf says, “the main way that brands can take responsibility for animal welfare within their supply chains … is by showing a good certification is applied”.

The report specifically cited the Responsible Wool Standard and the Responsible Down Standard as preferred certifications – among others. Hermès cites they are moving towards both of these standards by 2024.

John Lau, the Dean of Academic Strategy at the London College of Fashion, is critical of the report and the methodology. He says it “is not entirely clear, because the results of the research are not published in full”.

Lau says only publishing the scores of the best and worst performing brands is also a missed opportunity, “much can be learned from brands that are improving” he says, specifically citing Kering’s efforts.

Medcalf says “we have withheld most scores, as we aim to give the majority of brands the space and support to understand and address animal welfare within their corporate and social responsibility goals”.



However, she states that Four Paws intend to publish all brand scores in the next report, and the scoring will be updated over time on Good On You’s platform.

She says the goal of the report is to “benchmark how the fashion industry is progressing” in order to “motivate the brands to change” and “at the same time, give us the information that we need to be able to support those brands to change”.

Lau feels that the burden of change should not fall solely on brands. “Farms, which are at the start of the process, must be made accountable to how their animals, whether farmed-on-demand or a by-product, are being treated.”

Additionally, it is important to take a holistic view of the issues, Lau says. “Reducing the reliance on animal derived material may improve animal welfare, however this cannot be to the detriment of destroying natural habitat to grow more plant-based fibres, or developing polluting synthetic materials that affects wildlife.”

LVMH and Prada were contacted for comment, but had not supplied a response at the time of publication"

Having targeted for its use of crocodile skins in fall of this year, animal rights NGO continues to take aim at major luxury houses. PETA Asia has published two investigations carried out in Indonesian slaughterhouses, including one which works for -owned and allegedly decapitates lizards while they are still alive. Two suppliers have also been accused of butchering snakes that are still conscious.

In the case of the slaughterhouses linked to LVMH, a distressing video shows pythons being hung up in order to be filled with water via pipes. This is meant to stretch the snakes' skin before they are stunned with a hammer then decapitated while obviously still alive. In a video taken in a slaughterhouse linked by PETA to Gucci, the snakes are stunned or killed by being drowned in buckets of water, before receiving up to 14 strikes with a machete in order to be decapitated. According to PETA, lizard heads remain conscious and can still feel pain 30 minutes after being cut off. Two still living heads can be seen in the videos published by the NGO.



""These luxury giants can't continue to close their eyes to the suffering of animals,"" said Mimi Bekhechi, vice president for international programs at PETA. ""Cruelty is inherent to the production of exotic skins, and it's time for these brands to join the numerous couture houses that have already banned them.""

For the NGO, these images contradict the commitments made by Kering to ""implement and verify the highest standards in terms of animal welfare in its supply chains"" and to ensure ""ethical treatment at the end of life.""

Louis Vuitton show pays tribute to designer Virgil Abloh - Spectrum News,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL2FwLXRvcC1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvMDEvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zaG93LXBheXMtdHJpYnV0ZS10by1kZXNpZ25lci12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Louis Vuitton's first ever U.S. fashion show turned into a somber yet whimsical tribute to groundbreaking designer Virgil Abloh days after his death.

The Miami menswear event, an unofficial kickoff to the prestigious Art Basel fair, had been in the works for months. Guests were ferried by yachts to the star-studded affair held on an island. Celebrity attendees, including Kim Kardashian West and her daughter North, Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, model Bella Hadid, Joe Jonas, Maluma and Pharrell, arrived in sleek LV monogrammed silver speedboats.

Kid Cudi and Erykah Badu performed at an after-party. “Hey Virgil,” she yelled at the start of her set, later saying “we want to see you fly.”

Abloh, who died Sunday after a lengthy battle with cancer, was known for pushing boundaries as the head of the legendary French fashion house, thanks to his childlike curiosity and an eagerness to instill a sense of playfulness. His groundbreaking fusions of streetwear and high couture made him one of the most celebrated tastemakers.

A focal point of the show was a giant, red LV monogrammed hot air balloon that puffed flames as Abloh’s voice was heard in the background.

The brand's CEO Michael Burke said Abloh's wife and family wanted the show to go on. He had just spoken to the young designer on Saturday night, describing the inspiration for the show as a coming of age of sorts because “inspiring and empowering younger generations defined who he was.”

“We had imagined it all and he was distraught not to be here in person,” Burke said.

Models walked the meandering runway, showcasing the collection that featured everything from neon colored amphibian, aqua-gear looks with colorful fish backpacks to letterman style school sweaters and snow bunny looks with furry boots.

There was a sleek matte black ensemble that resembled SWAT gear, military style suits in olive with belted coats and even brightly color Southern-belle style hoop skirts. Prints included tie dye hues and the iconic checkered logo redone in new color patterns.

While the clothes were like Abloh — playful, colorful and vibrant — the mood was somber. During and after the show, many in the audience wiped away tears, standing to hug each other or offer a pat of comfort.

The sparse clapping at the end was awkward. Unlike most shows, no one got up to mingle or talk, but instead sat in heavy silence.

The designer's traditional finale bow was not coming and never would again and as fireworks lit up the Miami skyline, the audience seemed painfully aware of his absence.

Instead, the show circled back to the bold hot air balloon as the designer’s voice said “life is short,"" warning, “you can’t waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do” — a sort of anthem that a generation of young fans rallied behind.

Lamont Spears traveled from Atlanta just for the show, wearing a fuzzy LV monogrammed hoodie coat and a sweatshirt with Abloh's picture.

“It's a very sad moment, but we've got to celebrate his life, we've got to keep on pushing because he made a way for us to keep going, to keep being confident,"" said the 35-year-old. “He showed me that I can.”

Abloh in 2018 became the first Black man to serve as Louis Vuitton’s director of men’s wear in the French design house’s storied history. He grew up outside of Chicago, his first generation Ghanaian American seamstress mother teaching him to sew.

New York stylist Memsor Kamarake, who saw Abloh's first show in Paris, flew in specifically for the final tribute, saying through tears after the fireworks, “I felt like now I can finally grieve him.”

“So often black folks are depicted through pain, through struggle, that's why it was so important for him to tap into this childlike joy,” Kamarake said.

Above a red carpet leading to an outdoor after-party, the sky lit up with red dots that danced in various configurations before coming together to say “Virgil was here.”

Abloh, who founded his own Off-White label in 2013, had a vast creative presence outside of clothing. His sculpture “Dollar a Gallon,” unveiled this week during Art Basel, is a commentary on the effect of advertising on the impressionable.

He also designed furniture for IKEA, refillable bottles for Evian and Big Mac cartons for McDonald’s. His work was exhibited at the Louvre, the Gagosian and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

Abloh had a prominent influence in streetwear. He interned with Ye at the LVMH brand Fendi, was the rapper's creative director and scored a Grammy nomination as art director for the 2011 Ye-Jay-Z album “Watch the Throne.”

“I think it's going to be the most important moment ever in LV history,” said David Filipucci, a 21-year-old who traveled from the Netherlands to attend the show.

“LV for the moment is Virgil. He made it more special.”

By Alice Brooker

Rye whiskey producer Whistlepig has partnered with LVMH-owned Moët Hennessy to launch a marketing drive in the UK and Europe.

Last year, Moët Hennessy acquired a minority stake in Whistlepig with the aim of helping the Vermont-based brand to expand outside of North America. The deal marked Moët Hennessy’s first route-to-market spirits partnership.

The rye whiskey producer has now revealed its larger-scale activity planned for next year in the UK and Europe, with a focus on the brand’s core range of whiskeys, and more limited edition releases to UK and European markets.

Jeff Kozak, CEO of Whistlepig, said: “We are delighted to be taking Whistlepig to market in both the UK and Europe, having the chance to showcase our very special range of whiskies to consumers who might already know of us, but have not yet had the chance to hear our story or taste our highly decorated range of whiskeys.

“The continued interest in American whiskey from consumers within the European market, alongside the dynamism we are starting to see again in the on trade offers the perfect opportunity for our brand and whiskeys to hopefully flourish.”

The whiskey company, which was founded in 2007, has on- and off-trade activations planned for 2022, with an emphasis on industry education and advocacy, following the brand ‘actively exploring options’ to move into new markets over the past year.

Alexei Rosin, managing director at Moët Hennessy UK, said: “It is an exciting time for American whiskeys and our partnership with Whistlepig offers a fantastic opportunity to expand our spirits expertise, whilst building a portfolio of both luxury and craft boutique brands.”

The UK is the rye whiskey brand’s first global focus market.

The Whistlepig core range includes Whistlepig Rye Whiskey Aged 10 Years, Old World Rye Aged 12 Years and Estate Oak Rye Aged 15 Years. The bottlings can be purchased through Clos19.com from RRP £80 (US$105.94).

Earlier this year, Whistlepig moved into Irish whiskey with the revival of the Limavady brand."

A disturbing, first-of-its-kind PETA Asia investigation reveals exactly how pythons are being killed for LVMH’s snakeskin bags and shoes. Investigators visited two Indonesian abattoirs that supply LVMH – which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and other fashion brands – and documented workers bashing snakes in the head with hammers, pumping them full of water, and skinning them – likely while they were still conscious.

Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, claims that its raw materials “are produced in a responsible manner … combining ethics with respect for the environment” and that “animal welfare … and species conservation are respected”. And Louis Vuitton’s CEO, Michael Burke, recently claimed that all the animals in the company’s supply chain are “humanely farmed”.

Kering and LVMH, parent companies of Gucci and Louis Vuitton respectively, have released their statement.

Kering, who has already stopped dealing in fur items, commented:

“while we have taken these allegations very seriously, there is no evidence that Kering brands are directly or indirectly connected with this facility or those practices. Such practices are strictly forbidden by Kering’s animal welfare standards.”

The company reassured PETA that it is investigating the matter internally, and that if any connection is found with the facility, it would result in an immediate termination of business with them.

LVMH released a statement via The Post, which read:

“LVMH respects all views and sensitivities on the use of animal-based raw materials and we support and are actively involved in the sector’s efforts to achieve the best possible practices. Our intention is to provide customers with a product that has been made in the most responsible and ethical manner possible.”

Both companies have launched vegan leather items in the past year. Louis Vuitton has released a sneaker called Charlie, made from a substance called Biopolioli, a polyurethane product derived from corn starch. Gucci introduced Demetra, a sneaker made from a new leather alternative made from plants, wood pulp, and viscose.

Bernard Arnault's Youngest Son Is Working at Louis Vuitton - Yahoo Singapore News,"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXlvdW5nZXN0LXNvbi13b3JraW5nLTA2MDExNjk3MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The youngest son of Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has followed his four siblings and joined the family-controlled luxury goods giant.

Jean Arnault quietly joined Louis Vuitton at the end of August as marketing and product development director, watches.

More from WWD

He is based at Vuitton’s headquarters in Paris, as well as at La Fabrique du Temps near Geneva, Switzerland, one of Vuitton’s watch production sites. He reports to Catherine Lacaze, director of watches and jewelry at Vuitton.

“Jean joins us following two successful assignments at Louis Vuitton, first at the Maison Champs-Élysées and then with the headquarters’ watches and jewelry department,” Lacaze wrote in an internal memo seen by WWD.

“In his new role with the watches team, he will be involved across the value chain, including defining strategy, steering product development and innovation, and retail launches,” she added.

Jean Arnault, 23, has a master’s degree in financial mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London after receiving a scientific baccalaureate with the highest honors from the prestigious private school Saint Louis de Gonzague-Franklin in Paris.

His LinkedIn profile lists summer internships as an investment banking analyst at investment firm Morgan Stanley; as an engineering intern at Formula 1 team McLaren Racing; and as a sales associate at Louis Vuitton.

The internal announcement notes that he has also applied his watchmaking knowledge at the Tag Heuer Research Institute.

Jean Arnault’s nearest sibling in age, Frédéric Arnault, another math and science whiz, is currently CEO of LVMH-owned watch brand Tag Heuer.

His eldest brother Antoine Arnault, currently CEO at Berluti and head of communications, image and environment for the French luxury group, also started his LVMH career at the Vuitton brand, first working in the marketing department and overseeing stores in the French provinces.

Story continues

Alexandre Arnault, currently executive vice president of products and communications at Tiffany & Co., started his LVMH career in 2015 as an investment manager, which led to the acquisition of German luggage-maker Rimowa.

Delphine Arnault, currently executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, started her career at McKinsey, the consulting firm, and joined LVMH in 2000, heading business development at John Galliano for a year before moving over to Dior as commercial director in 2001.

Jean Arnault teased his arrival at Vuitton’s watch division with an Instagram post of the entrance to La Fabrique du Temps, writing “New adventure starting!”

His feed suggests a love of animals, travel, nature, architecture, skiing and golfing.

"Touching Base: M&A Mastermind Allan Ellinger Talks Supreme, Camuto, Virgil Abloh and Off-White - Sourcing Journal","Fri, 10 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3NvdXJjaW5nam91cm5hbC5jb20vdG9waWNzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9zdXByZW1lLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1vZmYtd2hpdGUtYWxsYW4tZWxsaW5nZXItbWVyZ2VyLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWx2bWgtY2FtdXRvLTMwNDQzMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two-high profile luxury streetwear firms, Supreme International and Off-White, have garnered serious attention on the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) front over the past few years, particularly as the industry is focused on the Covid-19 pandemic and its evolving aftermath.

In another financial Q&A series installment, Sourcing Journal caught up with Allan Ellinger, founder and senior managing partner of MMG Advisors, to get his take on where M&A activity is headed.

The boutique investment firm, run by former business owners and operators, represented Supreme founder James Jebbia in two of the company’s earlier M&A transactions. MMG also represented Camuto Group in its sale to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) and DSW Inc., as well as the late Virgil Abloh in negotiating both his position to become artistic director of Louis Vuitton Menswear and the sale of a majority stake in his Off-White brand to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in what was a two-step process. This interview was conducted shortly before Abloh unexpectedly passed away at the age of 41 after a battle with cancer and has been lightly edited for clarity.

Sourcing Journal: One of the big deals recently was VF Corp.’s $2.1 billion purchase of luxury streetwear brand Supreme International. While MMG was not involved in that deal, your firm was involved in the first two “sales” of Supreme, including the $500 million purchase by Carlyle for a 50 percent stake in 2017. Can you talk about your involvement in Supreme?

Allan Ellinger: When MMG first became involved with Supreme, the company was a very profitable, growing business. In our initial transaction for James, we sought a partner to fuel Supreme’s growth trajectory. That transaction led to a sale of a minority interest to Goode Partners.

The company’s performance and profile continued to be outstanding, and James and Goode Partners decided to pursue a transaction that could drive the company’s global growth, resulting in a sale of a majority interest to The Carlyle Group in October 2017.

SJ: Was the transaction with Carlyle pitched to other private equity firms too?

AE: Supreme was very specific in wanting a limited process so we engaged in conversations with very few parties. Many companies do not want to go through a public auction because they are often concerned that their stakeholders—employees, customers, suppliers—will become aware of the transaction and change of ownership. And in this case, James didn’t want to compromise in any way the relationship that he had with his stakeholders.

SJ: What clinched the deal in favor of Carlyle?

AE: In no way did James push the envelope and try to drive up the price and take every single dollar off the table. That was not his agenda. He wanted to find the right partner and negotiate what can be perceived as a fair deal, and that’s what he did. He liked Carlyle, and the fact that it had similar transactions in Europe with companies that he admired. He also liked the corporate culture. The Carlyle Group brought tremendous scale, financial strength, expertise in complex transactions, a track record of building companies, and extensive experience with the consumer and retail industries. James was also very comfortable with the team at Carlyle and their alignment with his vision.

SJ: In terms of James’ preference for making the right deal and finding the right partner, is that primarily what sellers are looking to do or is that only for firms where the founder wants to stay on with the company?

AE: For the privately held, family-owned or entrepreneurial firms, typically the buyer is not writing a check and paying the entire purchase price. Most often, what happens is the purchaser is paying 50 percent to 60 percent of the purchase price, with the balance over a three year period called the earn-out. While sellers want to make sure the buyer is culturally compatible, buyers want to make sure that there’s going to be continued involvement of the founder or the operator of the company that’s being sold.

SJ: Does that mean getting top dollar isn’t always the goal?

AE: The right buyer is the one who is aligned with our client’s needs, has the financial resources to close the deal and fund the company’s future. Getting the best price is always a consideration, but the more important priority is finding the right buyer who is going to be the best fit for the owners.

What defines a great fit may differ, and it is our job to identify synergies or strengths that will result in success for both buyer and seller, as well as the alignment on the vision for taking the business forward.

Sellers typically seek buyers that bring other assets and capabilities to the table in addition to purchase prices, such as a great sourcing structure, digital experience, supply chain infrastructure, complementary distribution, knowledge of global markets, expertise in M&A, as well as brands and licenses that our client can tap into.

SJ: In July, LVMH said it was taking a 60 percent majority stake in Off-White LLC, a streetwear brand launched in 2012 that also has been a big player in the luxury sector. The late Virgil Abloh, the brand’s founder and 40 percent minority owner, was the artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear collection since March 2018. What can you tell me about the two deals?

AE: Virgil and LVMH discussed a plan for him to assume the role of artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s business, and in addition to LVMH acquiring a minority stake in Virgil’s very successful Off-White business.

Virgil did agree to take on the director role at LVMH, while the two agreed to LVMH acquiring a minority stake in Off-White. Their agreement allowed Virgil to continue to build the Off-White brand while working for LVMH. It also contained an option that gave LVMH a second bite of the apple to acquire majority control of the brand.

SJ: Was being hired as the men’s designer the priority of the two?

AE: Initially it was—that was one of the most coveted design jobs in the world. For Virgil to be associated with that business as creative director was a confirmation of his artistic and cultural stature. And for LVMH, his talent and influence added tremendous cachet with today’s luxury consumers.

SJ: Isn’t that type of option unusual given that LVMH is a strategic buyer?

AE: Typically, when businesses are sold to strategics, they acquire 100 percent of the business. When you sell to private equity, there may be tranches where a minority interest is initially sold and they later exercise an option for a majority interest. Having the seller retain some ownership gives the individual the ability to participate in the profitability of the company. It also keeps the individual engaged and aligned to grow the business.

LVMH has been built as a conglomeration of fashion brands, and it has over the years brought in young designers to continue to push their iconic brands into the future. In a number of cases, LVMH purchased all or part of those designers’ businesses in order to attract them. That is how it was able to attract Virgil.

SJ: Is the average earn-out still about two to three years?

AE: The average is three years. The earn-out is intended to protect the buyer from short-term dramatic shifts in the marketplace, keep the seller engaged in running the business and assisting in a smooth transition to the new owner. Buyers want to make sure that the business and profits that they’ve paid for are sustainable.

SJ: Let’s talk about your representation of the Camuto Group. How did that come about? Had you known Vince Camuto and the family before he passed in 2015?

AE: MMG did represent the Camuto family in the sale of Vince Camuto to ABG and DSW. We were introduced to the Camuto Group by Ariel Chaus, the CEO of Bernard Chaus Inc. (BCI), which was owned by Camuto Group. (Editor’s note: Bernard and Josephine Chaus, Ariel’s parents, co-founded BCI in 1975 as a moderately priced line of women’s office-friendly apparel and later expanded into sportswear. BCI, which went public in 1986, became a private company when it merged with Camuto Group in 2021.)

SJ: Did you pitch the Camuto company to a wide group of potential buyers? Was ABG part of that group or was ABG the one that reached out to you? Was DSW in talks with Camuto too or did ABG bring DSW onboard when it was looking for an operating partner?

AE: The Camuto sale process involved marketing the company to a broad group of potential buyers. MMG included ABG in its outreach in the sale process, as well as DSW. During the process, ABG and DSW agreed to partner in the bidding for the Camuto company, with ABG acquiring the intellectual property and DSW becoming the operating partner. As part of the process, Ariel Chaus bought back BCI in a separate transaction.

SJ: Following the initial wave of the pandemic last year and its impact on M&A deals, how has Covid affected dealmaking?

AE: Covid had a very disruptive effect on M&A in 2020. Supply chains were disrupted and then demand evaporated, resulting in a total lack of liquidity.

As the country started to emerge from the worst of the market disruptions in 2021, M&A activity has started to return and both strategics and private equity have actively sought opportunities in an effort to invest early in the recovery cycle.

SJ: As you look at the M&A landscape and who might be buy and sell candidates, what are some saying about inventory levels right now?

AE: I spoke to a very large public company not that long ago, and he said to me, ‘I’ve got four weeks of inventory and I’m only comfortable with eight to 12.’ Companies have a smaller supply than they had planned for. Because of supply chain complications, they’re not getting the amount of product that they need.

SJ: What is the environment right now for M&A deals?

AE: Private equity is out there looking at businesses, and we are also getting inbound calls from strategics looking to acquire companies opportunistically. Interestingly, many thought there would be a lot of troubled companies due to the pandemic that could be acquired inexpensively. In fact, operators who may have gotten into trouble due to Covid haven’t needed to sell because they were able to stay afloat and, in some cases, had a great year.

Recently, large public strategics have ventured back to M&A, including Levi Strauss & Co.’s plan to acquire activewear brand Beyond Yoga in August, and G-III Apparel Group Ltd.’s agreement to buy luxury brand Sonia Rykiel in September.

SJ: We just saw American Eagle acquire a logistics startup (and then a second one). Has what strategics are looking for changed from the pre-Covid days?

AE: Strategic buyers are looking for opportunities in either spaces they are comfortable in or in adjacencies; they’re motivated by needs and opportunities. In the case of American Eagle, the two acquisitions have been in furtherance of the need to enhance capabilities to drive advanced logistics systems. Digital commerce and the need to service customers wherever they are shopping has put a premium on systems that bring efficiencies to distribution.

M&A is a prime vehicle to accelerate the pace of change and gain market advantage. If you’re a strategic, you may be looking to acquire a company that either provides a brand or brings product diversification. And if you’re a strategic and you’re not selling to every retailer, you may be looking to acquire a company who doesn’t sell to someone you’re already selling to. That’s a plus, and it complements your own distribution channels.

SJ: Anything else that might cause a rise in M&A activity?

AE: M&A is typically affected by external factors such as taxes, tariffs and pandemics. But the fundamental reason for the continue pace in M&A is to fuel growth and to mitigate risk."
"Gucci And Louis Vuitton Leather Linked To Barbaric Lizard And Snake Slaughter, Exposé Reveals - Plant Based News","Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGxhbnRiYXNlZG5ld3Mub3JnL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2d1Y2NpLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbGVhdGhlci1saXphcmQtc25ha2UtZXhwb3NlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

A newly released PETA Asia investigation has uncovered brutal slaughter methods and animal welfare violations within the snake and lizard leather trade.

The animal rights group investigated slaughterhouses supplying leather to Gucci and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, aka LVMH. The latter has a lengthy list of subsidiaries, including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, and Marc Jacobs.

Investigators discovered that workers at LVMH-supplying facilities forced hoses down the throats of pythons to inflate them with water. This allegedly makes it easier to skin them, PETA reports.

Workers hit the snakes repeatedly on the head with a hammer, sliced them open with razor blades, and disembowelled them while they were “likely still conscious,” the charity says.

At a Gucci-supplying slaughterhouse, workers reportedly held conscious lizards underwater while they flailed, before beheading them. Some lizards were struck up to 14 times with a machete before they were fully decapitated.

According to PETA, lizards can still remain conscious and capable of feeling pain for more than 30 minutes after decapitation.

Ban exotic animal skins

In response to the findings, PETA is urging LVMH and Kering – which owns Gucci – to ban exotic animal skins altogether.

The animal rights organization, said to be the world’s largest, penned an open letter to both companies, alerting them of the findings.

“No bag, belt, or wallet is worth such pain and suffering, especially since your designers have access to the most advanced and beautiful vegan leathers. These animal-free materials are more sustainable and can replicate the beauty of any exotic animal without harming them,” PETA wrote to Kering.

In its letter to LVMH, PETA highlighted that animal mistreatment has already been documented within the fashion company’s ostrich and crocodile supply chains.

PETA wrote, “Your company told us that you will take action if we can provide evidence of mistreatment directly linked to a farm you source from – and we have, again and again. Is your word of no value to you?

“As you know, there are ways to make money without causing such suffering. The world is turning to vegan materials, and innovative companies are leading the way. Isn’t it high time that you stopped using exotic-animal skins? Please say you will finally act.”

LVMH and Gucci’s inaction is evidence that the companies are “on the wrong side of history,” PETA’s vice president of international programs, Mimi Bekhechi, said in a statement.

They added: “PETA is calling on these companies to stop profiting from pythons’ and lizards’ misery and commit to a ban on exotic skins.”

A Big Question Amid Endless M&A: What About Goodwill? - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 04:36:13 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2EtYmlnLXF1ZXN0aW9uLWFtaWQtZW5kbGVzcy1tYS13aGF0LWFib3V0LWdvb2R3aWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deep Dives

A Big Question Amid Endless M&A: What About Goodwill?

The past couple of months have demonstrated the enduring rise in fashion and luxury deals, the very ones that were expected to unfold in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fosun Fashion Group, for instance, acquired Sergio Rossi in June, and a week later, LVMH assumed the outstanding 33% stake in Emilio Pucci. This month, Swiss conglomerate Richemont took a 100 percent stake in Belgian luxury brand Delvaux, LVMH announced a minority stake in Phoebe Philo’s soon-to-launch eponymous label, L Catterton Europe revealed that it will acquire a majority stake in Etro (pictured above), and just yesterday, LVMH made headlines when it confirmed that it will buy a 60% in Off-White.

Much has been made of growing number of M&A transactions, with many rightly pointing to the effect that the pandemic has in bringing these deals into fruition. As Ermenegildo Zegna Group CEO Gildo Zegna noted this week in connection with news that the privately-held Italian fashion group will go public on the NYSE later this year via a merger with Investindustrial Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition corporation, “The luxury business has become very challenging,” making it even more difficult for independent brands to compete. Low interest rates and excess cash on hand for the likes of LVMH, Kering, and co. have further spurred the trend.

To date, conversations have largely centered on the impetus for these tie-ups, the deals that may still in the making (An acquisition by Prada? A deal between Exor and Armani, despite recent reports to the contrary? The sale of Valentino?), and what this wave of consolidations means for the industry as a whole. One thing that has not been discussed with the same frequency is the topic of goodwill and brand equity, and how these are impacted by M&A activity, such as the deals that are currently underway.

Goodwill & Brand Equity

Two heavily intertwined concepts, brand equity is the value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name (or logo) compared to an equivalent. Goodwill, on the other hand, refers to the reputation that a company earns in the minds of consumers. Ultimately, both are dependent on the fact that a brand (and its value) is more than just a name or a logo.

Methods for determining brand equity

Certainly, trademarks – from brand names and logos to source-identifying product configurations and packaging – are valuable and heavily monetizable assets for companies, especially in the fashion and luxury space, hence, the markup for logo-bearing luxury goods and the often-eye-watering valuations for brands in this segment of the market. Yet, the reason that brands’ names and other trademarks have such significant value is a direct result of the goodwill that they embody. This is built by brands over time (arguably less time than ever before thanks to the rise of e-commerce and social media) by consistently providing quality products and services, telling carefully-crafted stories by way of their marketing efforts, etc.

Given that trademarks depend, in large part, on things like goodwill in order to generate value for a company both in terms of day-to-day interactions with consumers, as well as in M&A scenarios, the influx of deals in the luxury space raises important questions about how goodwill may be impacted in the event of a sale, and if and again, how a company can maintain a brand’s goodwill – which is a big part of what it paid for, albeit indirectly – on the heels of an acquisition.

A review of the market reveals (at least) two common instances in which goodwill is potentially at risk: (1) instances in which a large conglomerate takes ownership of a company, and grows the scale, potentially risking saturation of the market and weakened demand and pricing power; and (2) situations where the buyer and acquisition target lack synergy, thereby, resulting in a different – and most likely, diminished – reputation in the eyes of consumers. (These are not necessarily mutual exclusive.)

Expansion & Dilution

The first situation is a familiar one, as big fashion and luxury groups are in the business of buying up established but not-fully-scaled brands, and creating further opportunities for growth. There is a risk of over-saturation of the market as a whole – and the various regional markets – when volume is increased, which stands to negatively impact a carefully-positioned brand’s goodwill and equity, particularly if that positioning involves the notion of scarcity. However, luxury strategy consultant Jean-Noël Kapferer, for one, has long held that “the size of a brand and its growing volume of sales is not a problem, as long as prices keep rising.” And in the luxury sphere, prices are, in fact, rising – from Chanel and De Beers to Dior and Tiffany & Co.

Tiffany, which was brought under the LVMH umbrella late last year, is one example. Luxury consultant Alain Huy has predicted that within 5 years, LVMH is likely to double the size of Tiffany’s business, which generated revenues of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2019 and $2.2 billion through third quarter 2020. If such sales growth is to be achieved, it will require expansion both in terms of product and reach, and LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault says that the group is “optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth,” presumably while still maintaining its cache. Or better yet, with Alexandre Arnault in place as the brand’s head product and communications, improving its cache, one splashy (and pricey) advertising exercise at a time.

Another example worth watching when it comes to maintaining brand equity while engaging in expansion is streetwear brand Supreme, which VF Corp. acquired in November 2020 for $2.1 billion. Given that Supreme has built a name that is “predicated on scarcity, which has driven the extremely strong full price sell-throughs and high margins,” Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow has said that VF will need to “be careful about driving growth without losing the brand’s ‘secret sauce.’” Boruchow asserted that the biggest question in his mind centers on whether Supreme will be able to “balance growth and brand perception” amid VF’s plans for international expansion.

That is still up in the air, as major expansion efforts have not yet come into fruition. For the time being, the lines outside of Supreme’s New York locations each Thursday as of late – which is when the brand drops new wares, routinely drawing eager fans (and resellers) to its stores – seem to indicate that any potential for dilution has not kicked in. Any chance of waning demand will, of course, take time.

With the foregoing in mind, Tiffany and Supreme are key brands to watch if you want to gauge if – and how – companies can successfully balance the largely competing aims of equity and expansion.

Same Synergies?

The second scenario is one in which the buyer and acquisition target lack synergy, thereby, giving rise to a potential for a diminished reputation in the eyes of consumers. This very well might be what plays out in connection with the recent acquisition of Ralph & Russo. The London-based couture house made headlines early this month when it was bought out of bankruptcy for an undisclosed sum by Retail Ecommerce Ventures. In furtherance of what it calls a “strong track record of acquiring and growing iconic retail brands globally,” Miami-based REV has readily been snapping up bankrupt brands since it launched in 2019.

Unlike the allegedly mismanaged Ralph & Russo, whose clients consisted of British aristocrats, Hollywood stars, and Middle Eastern royalty, REV’s current holdings consist of mass market companies like Pier 1, Radio Shack, Stein Mart, and Dress Barn.

Speaking of 15-year-old Ralph & Russo, REV Executive Chairman Tai Lopez stated that it is a “globally celebrated brand with a unique position in the luxury sector and significant brand affinity.” The question is whether REV can maintain that position – and the goodwill associated with it – in a post-acquisition capacity. This is where synergy (or maybe better yet, a lack thereof) comes in. REV’s lack of experience in the high fashion space sets the companies up for a potential disconnect, which may only be furthered by the fact that Ralph & Russo founders Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are no longer in the picture.

It is worth noting that goodwill does not automatically carry on just because it was once established by a company – i.e., if a brand does not continue operate in a way that enables it to hold a certain position and level of goodwill, it will lose it. As such, should REV operate Ralph & Russo in a way that consumers do not view is line with its previous endeavors (at least in a creative and client capacity), it runs the risk of losing value, which could have an impact on its pricing power. And if I had to guess, it is precisely the brand’s name and its association with truly high-end fashion that REV is likely banking on in order to leverage them to sell more accessible offerings in a purely digital capacity.

Again, it is too early to tell how it will play out, but I will certainly be watching.

Finally, it is worth considering – even with the foregoing in mind – that the notion of goodwill, while significant, is maybe not as rigid as we think it is. As marketing expert Mark Ritson asserted not too long ago, “The business of brand management is very risk-averse. We use words like ‘tarnish’ or ‘damage’ whenever we see a brand deviate from the strict trajectory that its positioning and brand image dictate.” But he also notes that “time after time, almost without exception, these deviations do not result in destruction.” Off-White and Virgil Abloh’s seemingly endless lineup of collaborations – from Evian and Ikea to Nike and Rimowa – something that goes against many of the tenets of high fashion and luxury marketing, might be proof of this. (There’s more about that here.)

The potential for brands to be surprisingly flexible in terms of their strength and for consumers to be forgiving in the face of robust expansion, if that expansion is done well, is something for companies to consider when it comes to the length to which they can extend their valuable brands, including in instances of buyouts."
LVMH buys out Marcolin's stake in optical manufacturer Thélios - Insight - Insight,"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lnaHRuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtb3V0LW1hcmNvbGlucy1zdGFrZS1pbi1vcHRpY2FsLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlci10aGVsaW9zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods company LVMH has reached an agreement to acquire Marcolin’s 49% stake in their joint-venture, Thélios, increasing the former’s shareholding in the high-end Italian optical frames manufacturer.

According to a statement, Marcolin will also buy back the 10% stake LVMH acquired in the firm when Thélios was founded in 2017.

As a result of the deal, Thélios will become fully integrated within LVMH, otherwise known as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

“This represents an opportunity for LVMH to further strengthen its presence in the eyewear industry leveraging its Italian savoir-faire, and for Marcolin to pursue future strategic investments,” the companies said in a joint statement.

LVMH originally teamed up with eyewear specialist Marcolin four years ago to establish Thélios and create a pathway into the eyewear market.

Thélios is focussed on the luxury eyewear segment, with labels such as Dior, Fendi and Celine.

In 2018, they opened the Manifattura Thélios, their flagship production site in Longarone, within the glasses-making district of Belluno, northeast Italy, with the firm now employing 800 people globally.

The manufacturing facility produces around 1.5 million optical frames annually, but has the capacity to increase this as its portfolio expands.

How the Cofounders of Streetwear Brand Madhappy Got Their Start - Business Insider,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFkaGFwcHktZ3Jldy1idXNpbmVzcy1hdHRyYWN0ZWQtbHZtaC1pbnZlc3QtMjAyMS0xMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mason Spector met brothers Noah Raf and Peiman Raf at Beverly Hills High School, and they later became friends with Joshua Sitt who grew up in New York, but it wasn't until they were in their early 20s that they talked about starting a company together, Spector told Insider.

The four founded the clothing brand Madhappy in 2017. The idea was to create a brand that felt inclusive and positive.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Growing up in LA and being in tune with the streetwear landscape and the creative energy of the youth, it felt very exclusive,"" Spector, 27, said. ""I have memories walking into stores on Fairfax like Supreme and feeling insecure or not sure if I was cool enough.""

Spector said he was experiencing a period of depression when he came up with the name Madhappy.

""It felt powerful and all-encompassing and seemed to represent both sides of life and the inevitable struggles we all face,"" Spector said. ""I don't think at the beginning we even knew we wanted to focus on mental health, but that's what it was born out of.""

The modern streetwear brand, which attracts many Gen Zers and millennials, uses a lot of color and bright, inspiring phrases like ""Treat Yourself Like Someone You Love,"" ""Feel Your Feelings,"" ""Inhale Exhale,"" and ""Empathy is Free"" on its clothing. Its hoodies cost about $165.

Since its inception, Madhappy has attracted celebrity customers like Gigi Hadid, Sofia Richie, and Cardi B. In its first full year in business, it generated about $1 million in sales, Business of Fashion reported. That got the attention of the luxury conglomerate LVMH, which invested $1.8 million in the company in 2019 alongside Tommy Hilfiger and the cofounders of Sweetgreen. This year Madhappy launched Local Optimist, a free online platform offering mental-health tools and space for people to share their stories about mental health.

Today, Madhappy has a staff of 28, Sitt said, and it produces its clothing in Los Angeles. In 2 1/2 years it's opened 12 pop-up stores in Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Aspen, Colorado, the company said.

Opening the first pop-up shop

The cofounders approach each collection with a concept in mind and then employ a full-time designer to help bring their visions to life, Sitt, 25, said.

The first collection had T-shirts, hats, and hoodies, which became well known for the distinct stitching on the hoods and the simple Madhappy logo on the left breast. A month after getting the company up and running, the cofounders opened a pop-up shop in Los Angeles, spreading the news to friends and family with celebrity connections.

""We were constantly getting creative with how we were really marketing the brand early on, because we started with just $15,000,"" Sitt said, adding that that was all money they'd saved up and that they didn't do any paid promotions or digital marketing.

""We were doing wheatpasting and putting up those types of 'no bill' billboards across cities when we were doing pop-up stores,"" he said. ""We were gifting our friends products and doing whatever we could on a grassroots level to get the brand out there.""

A big investor enters the picture

Sitt said LVMH sought out Madhappy during the brand's seed funding round.

""They were very intrigued by what we were doing. They were looking for new ways of speaking to their customers,"" he said, adding that connecting with Hilfiger and the cofounders of Sweetgreen via mutual friends helped. ""We were very fortunate to bring them on as we were learning,"" he said.

Sitt said funding had gone toward opening new pop-ups, trying to expand internationally, and setting up partnerships with brands like Headspace and Swarovski as well as the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""

Focusing on physical retail and marketing

Sitt said the company placed a high value on physical retail, recognizing the importance of creating a safe, calming space in line with the brand, as well as having a reliable revenue stream. Madhappy plans to open permanent shops in Los Angeles and New York next year.

Sitt described the pop-up shops as places to experiment with new concepts.

""For example, we have a reflection chamber in our current Los Angeles pop-up, and we have these conceptual pieces around flowers to bring the feeling of the out-of-city components into the middle of these big cities,"" he said. ""We create an escape that doesn't feel like a normal shopping experience.""

The pandemic has also allowed the cofounders to lean more into digital content and marketing and to try new campaigns. In addition to releasing a capsule collection for World Mental Health Day, Madhappy ran a billboard campaign in Los Angeles, released a podcast episode, and announced a research grant with the University of Pennsylvania.

Spector said the founders recognized the balance between promoting and selling products and being genuine activists.

""We talk the talk and walk the walk,"" Spector said. ""There are certain things that if it's not about mental health, we're not going to try and paint that story and monetize off of a movement. For example, we just launched Pixar and 'Toy Story' collaborations, and the theme of those is 'You've got a friend in me.' It's a beautiful story but doesn't try to profit off the mental-health movement. It's something we're very sensitive to and something we want to steer clear of.

""Growing up, I would wear a brand that I didn't know what it meant or stood for,"" Spector added. ""Now I feel everyone knows that what you wear says something about who you are, what you believe in, and what values you hold. Our strategy is making sure we stay true to our mission and who we are."""

Moet & Chandon is tackling climate change head on - The Peak Singapore,"Thu, 02 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvZ291cm1ldC10cmF2ZWwvY2hhbXBhZ25lLW9pcnktZXBlcm5heS1tb2V0LWNoYW5kb24tbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktcXVhbGl0eS1kZW1hbmQtc3RhbmRhcmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s Sept 22 and I’m standing in the Mont Aigu vineyards in Oiry near Epernay on the Cote des Blancs with Veronique Bonnet, Moet & Chandon’s vineyards manager.

Harvest started not more than 10 days ago, marking the end of an incredibly complicated growing season. This year, spring frosts and hail battered the Champagne region’s chardonnay, pinot noir and meunier grape varieties, and the rain didn’t stop all summer, which made controlling downy mildew a serious concern.

Certain sectors were hard hit with significant shortfalls in output. Overall, Champagne’s winegrowers suffered a yield loss of nearly 30 per cent due to frost. Mildew claimed another 25 to 30 per cent. Bonnet also noted how harvests in the past used to take place in October. Now, it begins a month earlier in September. It was worse in 2020. Harvest began in August, breaking the record of the earliest ever start date – a clear sign of the impact global warming is having on viticulture.

In 2012, to mitigate the effects, Moet & Chandon inaugurated a space dedicated to 21st-century winemaking: an ultra-modern, sustainable and energy-efficient vat room in Mont Aigu that became France’s first site to be awarded the High Environmental Quality label. It also opened a R&D facility worth 20 million Euros (S$31.3 million) in the Champagne region to address topics such as microbiology to select and adapt yeasts, carbon sequestration in the fields and making grape varietals and rootstocks resistant to climate change and mildew.

Manufacturing about 35 million bottles annually, Moet & Chandon – recognised for its flagship, non-vintage Moet Imperial champagne that was originally invented to pay homage to its long-standing relationship with French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte – is the leading producer of champagne today.

It is part of Moet Hennessy, the world’s largest luxury wines and spirits company owned by the LVMH Group. As it’s viewed as a global brand rather than a prestigious champagne producer, many often forget the important role it has played – and still does – in the history of Champagne. For example, it successfully fought off the devastating phylloxera plague of parasites living in the leaves and roots of vines in the late 19th century, and established a viticulture and oenology school and research institute to share its vine-growing knowledge in 1900.

One of its most influential leaders, Robert-Jean de Vogue, improved the social and working conditions of winegrowers years before others in France adopted similar obligations. It has always pioneered innovations, too. For example, in 1966, it became the first in Champagne to invest in stainless steel vats to improve wine fermentation and ageing processes. Last year, it presented its Living Soils sustainability initiative.

“As the leader in Champagne, we have the responsibility to do everything in our power to preserve nature and set an example for the entire region,” states Stanislas Milcent, Moet & Chandon’s quality and environment director. Owning the largest estate in Champagne today – 1,200ha of vineyards out of only 34,300ha in the well-guarded territory, along with 28km of underground cellars – the maison believes in caring for its terroir, the soil and its natural ecosystem, and learning from nature, on which it is dependent for its survival.

“Founded in 1743, Moet & Chandon has always believed that the exceptional quality of our champagnes owes much to the precious nature and soil that nurtures our grapevines,” notes Milcent. “It’s the source of our champagnes and the heart of our success. Our commitment to the preservation of nature and our vineyards for future generations has always been part of our philosophy. In 2000, we sped up sustainable viticultural practices because we could not stand by and watch the impact of climate change.”

Committed to sustainable viticulture for over 20 years, Moet & Chandon received ISO-14001 certification for all its sites and activities in 2007. Since 2014, all of its vineyards have been doubly certified for sustainable viticulture and high environmental value. “This certification, verified by the independent organisation Ocacia, has 99 criteria that range from soil and plant nutrition to management of vines and waste management,” explains Milcent. “Soil preservation is key for us. It contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and the coexistence of life with landscape elements, such as trees.

“On top of our 1,200ha of vineyards, we have another 469ha fully dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity with woodland hedges, forests and ponds. Each reserve contributes to fighting diseases and reducing water stress and temperature.”

In 1996, to regulate the insect population and decrease the influence of human activity on the natural ecosystem, it introduced a biological control technique known as “sexual confusion” in 93 per cent of its vineyards so that male moths wouldn’t mate with females. Last year, they became entirely herbicide-free.

Beyond its lands, Moet & Chandon works closely with a community of over 2,000 winegrowers and cooperatives to promote the biodiversity of the entire region and helps its partners to achieve the same certifications so that future generations can enjoy Champagne’s exceptional terroir. Currently, 20 per cent of the overall estate of its 2,000 wine growing partners (approximately 848ha) is certified as sustainable viticulture. Every year, it also purchases grapes from hundreds of wine-producing villages in the region to supplement the fruit of its vineyards while adding nuances to its own wines.

Moet & Chandon has set up its wine production and distribution processes to have the least potential impact in terms of consumption, emissions and effect on natural resources. Since 2012, it has reduced its carbon footprint by investing in green technology, becoming Champagne’s first company to buy electric straddle tractors with low noise levels and daily fuel savings of over 90 per cent. Its target is to increase its current fleet of 12 electric tractors to between 25 and 30 tractors by 2030. Today, it also recycles 99 per cent of its waste, uses 100 per cent green electricity and has reduced its water consumption per bottle by 20 per cent.

Continuing its tradition of investing in science, it has even built a biodiversity conservatory of Champagne grape varieties found on the oldest plots, and has conserved 900 clones to date. It hopes to reach 2,000 by 2022. The idea is to not only make it possible to adapt Moet & Chandon’s wine- growing practices to the climate, but to also pass on this heritage to its successors and other champagne houses, as a living archive of the region’s vines.

For Moet & Chandon, it hasn’t been about answering consumer demand or outdoing its rivals in the sustainability stakes. Instead, it wants to lead the way and get other winegrowers to move in the same direction for collective industry action. “Sustainability is not a competition,” Milcent concludes. “Moet & Chandon is constantly exploring and experimenting to preserve the natural balance of the Champagne terroir. However, it’s fundamental to understand that the result of every method depends on the climate, the terroir and the level of pests. It is, therefore, necessary to review the model constantly, observe and conduct small- scale tests to learn, act and move forward. This is Moet & Chandon’s approach in its quest to preserve nature.”
