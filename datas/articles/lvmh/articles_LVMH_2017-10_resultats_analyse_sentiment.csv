LVMH Q3 Sales Rise 13.6% - WWD,"Mon, 09 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc291bmRzLWNhdXRpb3VzLW5vdGUtYXMtc2FsZXMtanVtcC0xMy02LWluLXEzLTExMDIzNjgzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Luxury titan Bernard Arnault is never one to throw caution to the wind.

On the contrary, the group his family controls, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, reiterated that the sector should brace for a potentially tougher business environment ahead, even as it posted a 13.6 percent rise in third-quarter sales.

Sales in the three-month period totaled 10.38 billion euros, up 12 percent on an organic basis as brisk business in most divisions helped offset a drag from unfavorable exchange rates and slower growth in its wine and spirits activities. The sales rise handily beat consensus estimates that pegged the quarterly organic growth at 9.1 percent, according to Bernstein analysts who called the actual figure a “great performance once again.”

But the quarter was marked by a relatively easy comparable figure from the previous year and will “get tougher from here,” Bernstein said in a note to clients just after the sales release.

So far this year, LVMH has relayed a message of caution despite strong sales increases, warning against projecting the growth too far into the future. Luxury goods companies had been hit hard more than a year ago when a series of terrorist attacks deterred tourists, a key source of business for the industry. The weaker performance made for favorable comparisons once business picked up.

In its third-quarter release Monday, LVMH pointed to exchange rates and the global political environment as potentially complicating the outlook for high-end goods.

“In an uncertain geopolitical and currency environment, LVMH will continue to be vigilant,” the company said. It is to host a conference call Tuesday to elaborate on the numbers.

Currency rates had a negative impact of 5 percent over the first nine months, the company said.

Industry observers are carefully watching to see how much the strong euro will weigh on the sector. For luxury companies based in Europe, and incurring costs in euros, the strengthening currency weighs on margins. A strong euro also dissuades tourists from traveling to Europe, thus lowering the numbers of people likely to splash out on pricy goods there.

Last month, Compagnie Financière Richemont provided some initial signs of how the euro’s strength is affecting business for high-end goods. In its April to August trading update, the Swiss-based company flagged an “emerging negative impact of a strong euro on tourist spending” in continental Europe, where sales grew 3 percent, significantly lower than the 12 percent growth, at constant rates, over the five-month period.

French luxury peer Kering reports third-quarter sales on Oct. 24; Hermès International reports on Nov. 8.

Analysts say not all luxury goods companies are equally equipped to deal with currency headwinds.

In a recent research note, Bernstein signaled some will likely experience pressure on margins of earnings before interest and taxes for this year and next year, noting that companies like LVMH and Hermès could draw on strong brand momentum that provides pricing power.

“On the other hand, given the current weaker competitive positioning of Prada and Ferragamo, we see limited scope for these brands to increase pricing,” Bernstein added.

Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said LVMH’s third-quarter sales release bolstered the case for LVMH’s position as one of the stronger players in the sector.

“The release confirms our expectations what ‘winners will continue to win’ in soft luxury — with LVMH and Kering at the forefront,” noted Solca.

Solca added that he thinks the company “remains a high quality growth story” citing the integration of Christian Dior, rationalization at Marc Jacobs, traction of smaller brands like the shoemaker Berluti and the termination of a loss-making duty-free business in Hong Kong.

The largest division, fashion and leather goods, home to its star brand Louis Vuitton, clocked 13 percent growth on an organic basis for the quarter compared to the same period last year. LVMH highlighted the brand’s first smartwatch as well as efforts to improve the quality of its distribution network as contributing to Vuitton’s performance over the first nine months. The label just opened a new Paris flagship on the Place Vendôme in Paris.

Perfumes and cosmetics grew the fastest, up 17 percent on an organic basis over the quarter.

The company said supply constraints were the reason for a weaker performance from its wine and spirits division, which lagged other divisions with 4 percent organic growth over the quarter.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999957084655762}",positive,0.9999957084655762,1
"LVMH to Build Cognac Stocks, Starting With More Vineyards - The Business of Fashion","Wed, 18 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWNvZ25hYy1zdG9ja3Mtc3RhcnRpbmctd2l0aC1tb3JlLXZpbmV5YXJkcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Luxury goods maker LVMH hopes to be well on its way to remedying its cognac shortage two years from now, billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said on Wednesday, as its Hennessy label struggles to keep up with demand in the United States.

Sales at Hennessy, one of LVMH's big revenue drivers, are set to grow at a much more muted pace over the coming quarters as it grapples with low stocks and production problems, including hail and frost that hurt recent harvests.

With no quick fixes likely — cognac is a double-distilled spirit that needs to be aged for at last two years — Hennessy is tackling production constraints with an eye on the longer term, by planting more grapes, Arnault said.

""There is land within the area which is not being used,"" Arnault, LVMH's chairman and chief executive, told journalists at a new Hennessy bottling plant near the city of Cognac, on the banks of the Charente river in western France. The label works with 1,600 winegrowers there.

""We have a bottle shortage, given the success of our products across the Atlantic and in China,"" he said.

The acquisitive businessman — whose sprawling LVMH group, the world's biggest luxury goods producer, includes fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton and champagne label Moët & Chandon — ruled out buying up rival cognac makers to fix shortages.

Hennessy is looking to produce more of its lower-end ""VS"" stocks for the United States, the world's biggest cognac importer where the spirit is a popular base for cocktails.

Cognac has also shed its fusty image to become a hit with rap musicians.

""We will try to boost the product for which we have the greatest demand to satisfy... I'm certain that in a year or two we can do it,"" Arnault said.

Smaller peers such as Remy Cointreau are hoping to capitalise on Hennessy's US blip to take market share. Hennessy says it has 50 percent of the global cognac market.

Newer vineyards may take over six years to provide Hennessy with saleable cognac, but the firm would be able to release more stocks in the shorter term knowing it has more coming, Hennessy's chief executive Bernard Peillon said.

The new €100 million plant will lift Hennessy's annual production capacity from 2019 to 20 20 onwards to 10 million crates of Cognac bottles, up from 7 million now.

Ora Ïto uses hundreds of wooden slats for snaking oak stair at LVMH offices - Dezeen,"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxNy8xMC8xNS9sdm1oLW1lZGlhLWRpdmlzaW9uLW9mZmljZXMtc3RhaXJjYXNlLW9yYS1pdG8tcGFyaXMtZnJhbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French designer Ora Ïto has cut and pieced together over 400 wooden slats to create this staircase, which twists up the Paris offices for one of the world's largest luxury companies.

Ïto was tasked to design offices for the media division of LVMH, the parent company of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior. The department, which encompasses news brands Le Parisien and Les Echos, has its head offices located on 10 Grenelle in Paris' 15th arrondissement.

The staircase snakes up the four storeys of the office, comprising 429 wooden battens that cradle the underside of the stair and form the handrails on either side.

Curved edges detail each of the slats, so that when placed side-by-side, they form wave-like indents across the stair.

""I wanted the staircase to be the centrepiece of the building,"" said Ïto. ""This creature undulates in the space, shaping and pervading it.""

""This huge half-whale and half-snake chimera, snatches you, swallows you up and spits you out at the right floor,"" he added.

There is also a semi-circular indent on the inner side of the slats that forms a nook for the steel handrail, while LED lights illuminate the undersides of the stair treads.

A large hidden steel beam supports the slats, which are made of a mix of materials so they are as light as possible. Two layers of medium density fibreboard (MDF) are placed either side of a metal reinforcement and then covered in the French oak veneer to match the oak steps.

Lit by a huge glass wall and a roof light, the staircase is set to one side of the building, leaving plenty of open space around it.

Ïto also designed the surrounding areas as part of project, using the wooden slats to form walls of the auditorium on the lowest floor. He also created the reception desk on the entrance level from the timber elements, tapering the shape at the rear to form a tail.

Minimal finishes including bright white walls and flooring provide the backdrop to the stair. White columns support the upper levels, where curved balconies with glazed balustrades extend towards the staircase.

""The offices are intentionally minimalist, calm and functional without extraneous decor,"" said the designer. ""The refined details are unobtrusive.""

The staircase adds to a diverse portfolio of work by Ïto, following his tram designs for the Mediterranean city of Nice, a spaceship and a sedan chair for car manufacturer Citroën and a trainer based on the work of Modernist furniture designers Charles and Ray Eames.

Other spectacular staircases recently featured on Dezeen include one made from hundreds of plywood pieces slotted together like a jigsaw and a chunky, concrete spiral stair.

Phoebe Philo Said to Be Exiting Céline - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvcGhvZWJlLXBoaWxvLXNhaWQtdG8tYmUtZXhpdGluZy1jZWxpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH is interviewing designers to replace Céline creative director Phoebe Philo and rebuild the design team in preparation for her eventual departure from the French fashion brand, several industry sources in Paris and London with knowledge of the matter have said.

“The interviews have been going on for a few months now,” one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. Yet LVMH vehemently denied Philo was about to leave the brand: “We categorically deny any imminent departure of Phoebe Philo from Céline,” a spokesman for LVMH said. Renewed speculation that Philo would leave already prompted the luxury group to publish an internal memo earlier this year saying the designer remained committed to the brand. But LVMH did not deny that interviews for a replacement were taking place.

Another source with knowledge of the situation said Philo was expected to leave by the end of the year and the terms of her departure had been agreed before the summer. “It smells like the end of an epoch,” one headhunting source said on condition of anonymity.

Industry sources said potential replacements for Philo could include former Stella McCartney design director Natasa Cagalj, who is now at Ports 1961 and has a similar aesthetic. There is also Michael Rider, whose LinkedIn page lists him as design director of Céline ready-to-wear, though a spokesperson for Céline declined to confirm whether he was still with the label. Another name suggested by sources is Ilaria Icardi, the design director at Victoria Beckham, who was previously senior design director at Yves Saint Laurent and design director at Céline, according to her LinkedIn page.

Since joining Céline in 2008 after a three-year hiatus to focus on her family, Philo turned the underperforming label into a fashion authority with her minimalist designs. Philo, a graduate from London’s Central Saint Martins, was behind many of Céline’s hit bags. Over the past decade, she helped lift the label’s annual sales from €200 million to more than €700 million, according to analysts. (LVMH does not break out figures for Céline).

But if Céline is one of LVMH's most successful fashion brands, under Philo, one of fashion's last techno-refuseniks, it has also been a digital laggard. The label only launched an Instagram account earlier this year, long after competitors. At a time when e-commerce is one of the most significant growth opportunities in a slow luxury market — in the next 10 years, McKinsey & Company expects the share of luxury sales occurring online to triple, making e-commerce the world's third largest luxury market after China and the US — Céline has yet to embrace online sales.

The brand is thought to finally be launching e-commerce later this year under new chief executive Severine Merle, who arrived in April, replacing Marco Gobbetti, who left to take the helm at British megabrand Burberry. Previously, Merle was the deputy of Berluti chief executive Antoine Arnault and, before that, general director of Louis Vuitton France. Philo's departure is expected to help boost Céline's digital growth.

Philo studied with Stella McCartney and followed her when she took the creative director job from Karl Lagerfeld at Chloé in 1997. When McCartney left Chloé to set up her own fashion brand in a joint-venture with what was then called Gucci Group, now part of the conglomerate Kering, Philo was left out of the project and then CEO Ralph Toledano exploited the rift to place her in the top job in 2001. Philo left five years later having significantly boosted Chloé's sales revenues. Philo is part of an entire generation of young female designers who earned their first stripes at Chloé, including McCartney, Hannah MacGibbon, Clare Waight Keller and now Natacha Ramsay-Levi, who presented her first collection at Paris Fashion Week last month to much media acclaim.

Birthed in 1945 by Céline Vipiana as a children's shoe brand, Céline later expanded into women's ready-to-wear and accessories, and was integrated into LVMH in 1996 under the watch of chairman Bernard Arnault. The label is often cited as an example of the investor patience required to revive a luxury fashion brand. Though Céline enjoyed a short period of success under the designer Michael Kors, who led the brand's creative direction between 1997 and 2004, it never really took off until after Philo joined in 2008.

After roughly ten years at Céline, the designer has clocked up a tenure that’s much longer than many others who have cycled in and out of fashion houses at a rapid clip, with some lasting less than a year. But following several blockbuster years, Céline’s growth rate has slowed and Philo may be ready for her next move.

The group’s Selective Retailing division, which includes duty-free arm DFS and beauty retailer Sephora, reported total revenue for the first nine months of 2017 of €9.34bn.

The same nine months in 2016 saw total revenue of €8.28bn, which means reported revenue for the division increased 13% and organic revenue increased 12%.

The new multi-million euro complex took two years to build and now epitomises the emphasis that the group now places on combining both new and traditional technologies throughout the company, from the wines and spirits business through to its fashion, watches, certain DFS’ downtown premises and other businesses.

EMPLOYEES HELPED TO DESIGN THE NEW COMPLEX

The Pont Neuf facility was unveiled by Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, in the presence of Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, the Secretary of State to the Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Philippe Schaus, the newly-appointed CEO of Moët Hennessy and Bernard Peillon, President of Maison Hennessy.

LVMH says the new facility is also designed to provide its employees – who ‘played an active role in the design’ – with an exemplary working environment, following its conception back in 2015 – the 250th anniversary year of the Maison’s existence.

Commenting on the new complex, Arnault said: “This latest investment reflects the long-term vision that guides Hennessy and the entire LVMH Group.

THE ‘VIRTUOUS CIRCLE..’

“By making long-term investments in artisanal savoir-faire and in the appeal of our products around the world, we enable our Maisons to grow and develop employment in France, in the regions where they were founded.

“This virtuous circle both enhances France’s international attractiveness and supports local economic development, a strategy we intend to pursue.”

Besides increasing Hennessy’s production capacity, LVMH says the new facility will also coordinate easily with the nearby Vignerie site, while also securing production and logistics flows. It will also enable Hennessy to increase its output to around eight million cases a year by 2018.

[Hennessy Cognac/Armagnac is the leading producer within its spirits category and ‘the sixth most important spirits brand’ in the entire international duty free and travel retail business, selling around 630,000 nine-litre equivalent cases in 2016, according to industry analysts IWSR-Ed].

GLOBAL BRAND LEADER

Hennessy is currently the leading brand by volume in Cognac with a presence in 130 countries, exporting more than 99% of its production.

The company added: “The 30-hectare (74 acres) worksite met all the stringent requirements set by Certivea, earning it HQE high environmental quality certification. The facility is seamlessly integrated in the landscape and provides a superb, innovative working environment for staff, thanks to the choice of materials, acoustic insulation, air quality, natural daylight, ergonomics and building safety.”

Hennessy President Bernard Peillon commented: “Pont Neuf is much more than a strategic facility, it represents our vision and embodies the ‘Hennessy Spirit’.

“This new investment further extends the chain of excellence that begins with our 1,600 wine grower partners and continues with entire Hennessy community to deliver the cognacs in which we all take great pride.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9299274682998657}",neutral,0.9299274682998657,0

Serial yacht owners: Symphony - Yacht Harbour,"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8veWFjaHRoYXJib3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlcmlhbC15YWNodC1vd25lcnMtLXN5bXBob255LTIwNzQ_c3JjPW5ld3Nfdmlld19wYWdlX2JhctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"











With a net worth currently valued at $61,6 billion by Forbes , Bernard Arnault's 33-year run shaping the luxury world through his Louis Vuitton Moet Henessy Group, took him to being the 2nd richest person in Europe and in the world's top 10 billionaires.





In yachting however, the 68 year-old Frenchmen is most well known for his involvement in the sector. His first major step into superyachts became the conversion of the 70-meter Amadeus into a luxury yacht from a research vessel in 2007.













Rebuilt at Jade Yachts in Taiwan, the transformation was overseen by Vripack to a design by Redmond Langton with Francois Zuretti creating the yacht's new interior. Accommodating up to 12 guests in a master suite spanning over the entire upper deck, a VIP suite on the main deck, and two guest and two twin cabins on the lower deck, she stretched over a total of five decks.





From a technical standpoint, the yacht is powered by twin Caterpillar engines letting the 70-meter yacht cruise for up to 16,400 nautical miles at a speed of 10.5 knots. In 2015, Arnault sold Amadeus, which was later renamed to Felix by its current owner.













Around the same time, Feadship delivered the 101-meter Symphony, the largest yacht it ever built. According to Marianne , Symphony was delivered to Maltese company, Sonata Yachting, a firm which LVMH disclosed was a fully owned subsidiary in its yearly report.





A common feature found across the two yachts are their golf tee located aft of the upper deck, which allows its guests to shoot specially designed, bio-degradable balls into the sea from the yacht. Designed by Tim Heywood, Symphony has a gross tonnage of near 3,000GT.













Arnault's interests in yachting however are not limited to his personal fleet. In 2008, LVMH led an acquisition of British yacht manufacturer, Princess Yachts from South African investor, Graham Beck in a transaction that amounted to just over €250 million. The deal then saw L Capital, a fund controlled by LVMH, gain a 70% controlling stake in Princess Yachts.





LVMH then continued its efforts to expand into yachting by acquiring Royal Van Lent, a shipyard part of Feadship, later that year in a deal that analysts put at around €400 million. The shipyard later went on to build the 101.5-meter Symphony and remains a part of LVMH's portfolio to this day.

Iconic in many ways, luxury conglomerate LVMH and its CEO, Bernard Arnault have long set a gold standard in the luxury world and yachting was no exception to this rule. In fact, Arnault's 101-meter yacht, Symphony is currently the largest Feadship ever built.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0

Wines and Spirits achieved revenues of €3.5 billion, an organic increase of 8%, compared with Fashion and Leather Goods (14%), Perfumes and Cosmetics (14%) and Watches and Jewellery (13%).

“Champagne volumes were up 4%, with particularly strong demand in Europe and Japan,” the company states.

“Hennessy Cognac has been performing well since the beginning of the year. The volume increase was 9% for the first nine months of 2017, despite a third quarter decline related to supply constraints. Higher qualities progressed well.”

Weather issues in France, including spring frosts, have affected cognac production. LVMH has flagged that this will mean supply issues will continue for the group.

LVMH said the wine and spirits division saw sales in the three months to the end of September slip slightly, by 0.4%. The performance compares to a 13% rise in sales in the first quarter and a 10% increase in Q2.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",positive,0.9999991655349731,1
