"LVMH, Kering, and The New Luxury Strategy Post-COVID-19 - Jing Daily","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWtlcmluZy1hbmQtdGhlLW5ldy1sdXh1cnktc3RyYXRlZ3ktcG9zdC1jb3ZpZC0xOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both of the leading luxury groups, LVMH and Kering, released their half-year results last week. In both cases, the numbers were bleak, with revenues and profits falling by double digits.

According to Vogue Business, François-Henri Pinault, the chairman and CEO of Kering, stated, “Our results today underscore the extent of the disruption exacted by the pandemic on our operations.” Kering reported a profit decline of 58 percent year-on-year, and LVMH’s operating profit fell by 68 percent as its operating margin fell to 9 percent, which is exceptionally low for a luxury company.

Yet, these numbers come despite both brands showing dramatic growth in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division grew in the country by 65 percent in Q2, and Kering did 40-percent better there while trending upwards in June. These numbers underscore how the luxury market is going through a tectonic shift, with few markets thriving and many in freefall.

China is outperforming all other regions by far, with an overall second-quarter GDP growth of 3.2 percent, which can be attributed to strong consumer spending after lockdowns ended. Meanwhile, the US and Europe had historically low GDP performances during the same period. The exceptional growth numbers for these two leading luxury groups in China — particularly for their fashion divisions — indicates how luxury fashion and leather goods have become important growth drivers for the Chinese economy, even outperforming the automobile sector (10.2-percent growth) during Q2.

Despite the positive growth in China, the global numbers for LVMH and Kering show that there has been an unprecedented decline in the European and North American markets. Luxury is accelerating a geographical shift toward China that was already underway. Travel retail, a critical revenue source for the luxury industry, has practically come to a standstill, and its recovery may take years. The absence of international travel between the continents has shelved all luxury purchases by Chinese residents in Europe and North America. The return of spending from outside China is part of what led to the market to shift, and this change will have a lasting effect as these consumer habits solidify over time.

But the lockdowns and the collapse of travel retail both have had other serious implications for luxury brands’ revenue and profitability. Many luxury brands had relied on entry-level items (often licensed) such as sunglasses, beauty care products, and perfumes as critical cash flow and profit generators. They had depended on these on-the-go buyers who were traveling for business and pleasure. The pandemic has shown us how fragile these dependencies can be and how quickly these cash flow generators can dry up.

Lastly, many luxury stores and boutiques all over the world remain closed, operate curbside only, or are experiencing significantly less foot traffic. A leading luxury mall operator in Asia told me recently about some new consumer behaviors across Asia. Instead of browsing in stores for hours, consumers now quickly go in and out, minimizing the time they spend in stores to reduce potential virus exposure. This change has led to fewer purchase occasions and fewer items bought per shopping trip. Since most brands are still overly dependent on physical stores, digital growth has yet to compensate for the loss of physical sales. And no one is sure when consumers will feel safe again.

Many of these first half impacts are temporary. I’m still positive about my forecast that the luxury sector will lead market rebounds post-pandemic. However, the shifts that we saw over the first half of 2020 will change the playbook for most luxury brands.

First, luxury brands must now be able to pivot fluidly between the physical and the digital realms. They need to be where the customers are and serve them in a way that provides a consistent brand experience, regardless of the touchpoint. While many brands have much better digital infrastructures now, the ability to operate at the same level across all touchpoints and tell a brand story consistently are major weaknesses that have accelerated many brands' downfalls during this crisis and impacted their chances of rebounding after it. These are the top issues I recommend that brands focus on immediately, and they must play to win. Just being somewhat digital is a waste of resources and a growth opportunity.

Second, luxury brands must reduce their dependencies on travel retail and licensed, entry-level items. In many cases, these licenses will erode brand equity if they aren’t managed properly, even in good times. But in bad times, they become a double negative.

Third, China will continue to outpace all other regions for luxury. I’ve reported in my Future of Luxury columns on Jing Daily that many brands don’t have a comprehensive China strategy, and even more lack the expertise, systems, and tools to be successful in China. A surprisingly high number of luxury brands burn cash in China, only to realize later that they won’t succeed. Success in China requires a meticulous go-to marketing strategy, mastery of local social media and social selling channels, a deep connection with key opinion leaders, and a relevant brand message for the Chinese market. If your brand doesn’t have a luxury value creation system that’s suitable for China, there’s no way to build a profitable and lasting business there. Far too many managers still underestimate how crucial these challenges are in the world’s most important luxury market.

LVMH and Kering are two of the best-managed and most experienced luxury groups, and both are home to some of the most admired leaders, designers, and talents in the luxury industry. Each group has demonstrated that they can manage their brands more successfully over time than most others. Therefore, the signals we've seen in their short-term performances thus far in 2020 are important for the rest of the industry. The disruption of the luxury industry doesn’t just continue — it accelerates. Brands that read to these signals with more precision and can anticipate changes with rigorous action will emerge stronger. Standing still, on the other hand, isn’t an option.

"As Tiffany, LVMH Deal Drags on, What Does it Mean for Competition in the Luxury Sphere? - The Fashion Law","Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2FzLXRpZmZhbnktbHZtaC1tZXJnZXItZHJhZ3Mtb24td2hhdC1pcy1pdC1tZWFuLWZvci1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1pbi10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LXNwaGVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Almost eight months after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton confirmed that it would acquire Tiffany & Co. and bring the famed jewelry company under its umbrella in furtherance of its biggest – and most expensive – deal to date, the closing of the $16.2 billion merger is taking even longer than the parties initially anticipated. LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony revealed in a Q2 a call with analysts in July that “things are moving forward” with the headline-making deal, which was expected to close on August 24, but reports have since put the closing date closer to November 24 after the initial August deadline came and went.

COVID-19 concerns and debunked reports of renegotiations and/or open market stock purchases aside, a significant aspect of the holdup stems from the fact that LVMH is waiting for a number of antitrust approvals. The merger “has received all required regulatory clearances in the United States,” according to an April 2020 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Tiffany & Co., including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment. And it similarly has been given the green-light by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, Canada’s Competition Bureau, and the State Administration for Market Regulation of China.

However, at least a few key regulatory bodies, including the relevant entities in the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan, have not yet approved the transaction, which was given the go-ahead from Tiffany shareholders in February.

Lessening Competition?

In terms of what competition bodies look for when evaluating potential mergers, the FTC, for instance, is bound by the Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions when the effect of such a transaction “may be to substantially lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” With that in mind, the FTC says that “the key question” that it asks when it comes to scrutinizing mergers “is whether the proposed merger is likely to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise.”

Beyond that, the FTC asks whether the merger substantially lessens competition by, for example, “creating or enhancing the ability of the remaining firms to act in a coordinated way on some competitive dimension, or by permitting the merged firm to raise prices profitably on its own (unilateral effect)”? That is one of the questions that arises in a horizontal merger, which is a transaction between direct competitors, as opposed to those between companies that occupy different levels in a supply chain, such as a manufacturer and a distributor, or a distributor and a customer. (The latter of which is called a vertical merger).

This distinction is relevant to regulators (and merging parties, as well) given that the level of risk associated with the respective types of mergers can be quite different. In the eyes of the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice, “the greatest antitrust concern arises” in connection with horizontal deals, while vertical mergers have “historically been viewed by the agencies to be less likely to harm competition,” according to Freshfields’ Mary Lehner and Jenn Mellott.

Against this background and given that LVMH and Tiffany & Co. are more aptly described as occupying the same level in the supply chain (both are purveyors of luxury goods), making their tie-up more of a horizontal one than a vertical one, how is it that the major-merger got regulatory approval in the U.S. and what can be expected in the European Union?

Chances are, a lack of regulatory pushback in the U.S. – even in light of the chance that regulators “might be more likely to find a narrow ‘luxury only’ product market in which there are fewer participants each with higher shares” to be problematic from a merger point of view, per Schiff Hardin counsel Steven Cernak – is due, at least on a high level, to the diversified nature of LVMH, as a whole. After all, the Paris-based group is not merely in the business of offering up jewelry. As a luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH’s offerings range from fashion and leather goods to wine and spirits to media (it owns publications like general news company Le Parisien and financial news outlet Les Echos) and yachts. While quite a few of the 75 companies that it owns – from Louis Vuitton to Celine – do, in fact, sell jewelry, only six of its properties, including Bulgari, Tag Heuer, and Hublot, fall within its Jewelry & Watches division. That likely stands to diffuse at least some concern as to how the merger would impact the state of the market.

It is also significant that the Jewelry & Watches division is a relatively small portion of LVMH’s portfolio. Last year, the business segment was responsible for only 8 percent of the company’s total revenue of more than €53.7 billion ($63.43 billion), down from 8.5 percent for 2018. (Compare that to the 41 percent of group revenue generated in 2019 by the Fashion & Leather Goods division, for example).

Moreover, it probably helps that there are sizable competitors in this space, including Gucci-owner Kering and Cartier’s parent company Richemont, and that, as the Korean Fair Trade Commission asserted in connection with its approval of the LVMH and Tiffany tie-up, the global high-end jewelry market is largely devoid of any high concentrations even if the merger were to take place, given that there is a number of competing brands, including Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Boucheron, among others.

These points proved relevant when the European Commission cleared LVMH’s acquisition of Bulgari, for example, in June 2011, with the executive branch of the European Union determining that “the acquisition would not significantly alter the competitive structure of the markets concerned,” in part because “LVMH will continue to face effective competition from several other manufacturers of luxury goods.”

While the European Commission held that “Bulgari and LVMH both produce and sell high-end watches, jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics, as well as fashion and leather goods, including accessories, [and] LVMH owns and operates several selective distribution retail chains,” it ultimately asserted that its investigation revealed that their “combined activities do not give rise to high market shares under any plausible market definition.” As such, it concluded that “the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area or any substantial part of it.”

If the Bulgari approval is any indication, it seems feasible that the European Commission will approve the Tiffany deal.

COVID Consolidation

Looking beyond the specifics of the pending merger between Tiffany and LVMH, which was was underway before the onset of the COVID pandemic, it undeniably comes amid growing concern among regulators about market consolidation (mostly in the tech space, but also in terms of consumer goods companies). Coming with this is what Bloomberg calls “a sobering challenge for U.S. antitrust enforcers, [as] the pandemic risks worsening the very problems of rising concentration and declining competition that they were already trying to address before the outbreak.”

As the publication’s David McLaughlin wrote in May, “For years, antitrust experts and economists have been warning that markets were becoming less competitive, harming consumers and workers in the process.” Now, he says that “antitrust experts fear that as the largest companies increase market shares,” smaller entities, particularly ones impacted by continued effects of COVID, “might disappear or have little choice but to sell out at fire-sale prices to stronger rivals.”

Such consolidation is underway within the fashion industry, both in a COVID and pre-COVID capacity, heightened largely by the fact that titans like LVMH and its rivals are only gaining in size and power, and thereby, making it increasingly difficult for other entities to compete, and culminating in the pattern of many “smaller players” – or maybe better yet, single-brand players – seeking refuge with the industry’s behemoths. This has ultimately prompted the general consensus (at least from a markets point of view) that is that it is better to be big. It follows from this that “brands can do better with a conglomerate” behind them, as the Economist put it late last year.

Chances are, this will continue for the foreseeable future … to the extent that regulators see fit.

UPDATED (September 11, 2020): LVMH and Tiffany have received regulatory approvals from the Japan Fair Trade Commission and the Mexican competition authority, the U.S. jeweler said on Friday. As reported by Reuters, “Tiffany said in a filing on Friday the deal completion was still subject to approval from the European competition authorities and the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission.” Meanwhile, on Thursday, LVMH revealed that it would file its requests for approval to European authorities in the coming days, expecting to receive such authorizations in October."

The French luxury titan and the American jeweler need another three months to complete the $16.2 billion deal, regulatory filings show.



Though the deal was set to close Aug. 24, the terms included a stipulation that one of the parties could push back the closing to as late as Nov. 24 if needed.



Tiffany has postponed the closing, according to an 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



LVMH declined to comment on the date change. Tiffany did not respond to a request for comment.



Reports surfaced in June saying the deal was in jeopardy due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail and the civil unrest in the U.S. market as well as concerns about Tiffany’s ability to cover its debt covenants.The acquisition has yet to receive the necessary regulatory clearance from the European Commission, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica and the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission.LVMH announced its plans to acquire Tiffany in November 2019, looking to strengthen its presence in the United States.The deal was approved by Tiffany’s shareholders in February as well as the board of directors of both Tiffany and LVMH."
LVMH-owned Kendo sells in Ulta for the first time - Glossy,"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkva2VuZG8tb3duZWQta3ZkLXZlZ2FuLWJlYXV0eS1leHBhbmRzLXRvLXVsdGEtZm9sbG93aW5nLXJlbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the first time, a Kendo-owned brand is going beyond Sephora as its sole retail partner.

On Aug. 23, KVD Vegan Beauty will launch at Ulta stores and on Ulta.com. KVD Vegan Beauty, formerly Kat Von D Beauty, relaunched in January after founder Kat Von D formally resigned from the brand and sold her shares back to Kendo, its parent company. Kendo also incubated Fenty Beauty and Marc Jacobs Beauty. Kat Von D has faced accusations of anti-Semitism and promoting anti-vaccination conspiracies, which she has denied. According to social media posts in January from the brand’s Instagram account, the KVD in the rebranded name stands for “Kindness, Vegan [Beauty] and Discovery.”

The brand, which launched as Kat Von D Beauty in 2008, currently offers more than 250 products across 36 markets. Until the Ulta launch, it was exclusive to Sephora, Sephora.com and its own e-commerce site in the U.S.

“[KVD Vegan Beauty] really resonates with our millennial and Gen-Z customers because of KVD’s approach to cruelty-free and vegan beauty,” said Monica Arnaudo, Ulta Beauty chief merchandising officer. “KVD has a great opportunity to continue to drive awareness and reach our 34 million [customers]. We [over-index] with Gen Z, and I think that is very appealing to the Kendo team.”

Sephora has historically focused on premium and luxury brands, while Ulta has offered access to more drugstore brands and hair care. This demarcation is no longer a hard and fast rule, especially as Ulta has elevated its assortment with brands like Kylie Cosmetics and KKW while simultaneously going after Gen Z. Sephora, meanwhile, has focused on expanding its reach into new categories like clean beauty and CBD, rather than reaching new customer demos directly. Both retailers have had to adjust due to Covid-19, putting various expansion plans on hold or adjusting them — though Ulta has been comparatively more accessible thanks to its strip mall-centric store locations. LVMH does not break out Sephora earnings, but Ulta’s first-quarter earnings stated that its net sales had decreased by 33% to $1,173. It will report its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 27.

As part of KVD Vegan Beauty’s launch at Ulta, the retailer will feature branded creative designs by artist Ana Strumpf on its store windows, in-store gondolas and online. The packaging design of products has not changed since the relaunch. Additionally, Ulta will sell an exclusive best-seller kit and a limited-edition fanny pack, also designed by Strumpf. KVD Vegan Beauty will be a part of Ulta’s Conscious Beauty program, which launches in October."
Rihanna releases unisex skincare line Fenty Skin - Bizcommunity.com,"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpemNvbW11bml0eS5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZS8xOTYvNzg0LzIwNjg5NC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna has launched her much-anticipated skincare line, Fenty Skin, in partnership with Kendo Brands, an LVMH-owned beauty developer. Fenty Skin is Rihanna's second global beauty brand, following the launch of Fenty Beauty introduced in 2017.

According to a press statement, the new skincare brand is the ""culmination of Rihanna's global experiences, personal skincare journey and unwavering mission to provide simple solutions for all skin tones and types"". As a result, Fenty Skin has been designed to deliver clean, value-packed, multitasking products that work seamlessly with makeup.

Fenty Skin products have been tested on all skin tones, textures and types to ensure they would be effective for everybody, the brand said.

The gender-neutral Fenty Skin product line comprises three 2-in-1 products, collectively known as the Fenty Skin Start'rs: Total Cleans'r Remove-It-All Cleanser ($25), a makeup remover-cleanser; Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum ($28), a toner-serum hybrid; and Hydra Vizor Invisible Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen ($35), a moisturiser-sunscreen.

The range is said to feature clean, vegan, gluten-free and oil-free formulas. It combines globally-sourced ingredients like vitamin C-rich Barbados cherry, with gold standard skincare ingredients, like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. The products feature warm, tropical scents inspired by their ingredients like Barbados cherry, coconut and fresh desert melon.

""After years of feeling overwhelmed by all the skincare choices and a bad experience with a product that discoloured her skin as a teen, Rihanna dreamed of creating a line that was easy and effective. Now, she's created an approachable skincare brand built on years of unparalleled experience, access and education, representing everything she wished she had known when she was younger,"" the brand said.

To make packaging more earth-conscious, Fenty Skin has eliminated boxes where possible, incorporated post-consumer recycled materials and created refill systems where feasible.

Skincare expert and licensed esthetician Sean Garrette has been appointed as a Fenty Skin ambassador.

Fenty Skin has launched exclusively on FentySkin.com, with international shipping available."
A Look At LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault's $200 Million Feadship Symphony - Boss Hunting,"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9tb3RvcnMvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWZlYWRzaGlwLXN5bXBob255L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a net worth of roughly US$87.4 billion LVMH Chairman And CEO Bernard Arnault is France’s richest man, and indeed one of world’s wealthiest. Such is Arnault’s sway in the world of luxury, he’s earned nicknames like “the wolf in cashmere” and “the emperor of luxury”. So it’s no surprise that Bernard Arnault’s yacht Symphony is about as luxurious as they come.

Out of the famed Dutch shipyard Feadship, Symphony measures 101.5m (333 ft) and cost an estimated US$150 million to build. An immeasurable fortune for some, but a veritable drop in the ocean for Arnault.

In 2015 when it launched, Feadship Symphony was the first Feadship to cross the 100m mark sporting six decks of sumptuous facilities and technical excellence, including a helicopter pad and expansive ‘beach club’ at the rear.

The sun deck is home to an observation lounge, bar and Jacuzzi, while the bridge deck includes a large terrace with an outdoor cinema. A vast owner’s deck includes a beautiful full-beam stateroom with double bathrooms, dressing rooms and a sauna, a forward terrace with Jacuzzi, a private office and a study, a lounge and a spacious aft deck area for lounging with a dining table for twenty.

Among the many fine features found on the main deck is a 6-metre contraflow swimming pool, complete with its own waterfall. The lower deck is home to an ultra-high definition cinema, a lounge area below the glass-bottom swimming pool, the beach club, a dedicated golf tee area with biodegradable balls and a wellness centre.

The 8 stateroom yacht has been designed as the ideal place for its sixteen guests to enjoy themselves, with 27 crew on hand to tend to their every need.

Bernard Arnault’s personal interest in the sector began with the conversion of the 70m Amadeus from research vessel to luxury yacht in 2007. The following year LVMH led an acquisition of British yacht manufacturer, Princess Yachts which saw L Capital, a fund controlled by LVMH, gain a 70% controlling stake in Princess Yachts.

LVMH later acquired Royal Van Lent, a shipyard part of Feadship, which not only built Bernard’s latest beast but remains a part of LVMH’s portfolio to this day."

The new 11-room hotel officially opened on July 28, with limited availability due to Covid-19. It currently offers bookings from Thursday to Monday, with minimum stays of three nights to ensure that guest rooms will remain unoccupied for at least 24 hours in between stays. In addition, it’s operating its restaurant, café and cocktail lounge at 50% capacity. With additional Fresh alumni working on the new project, The Maker brings a beauty industry perspective to hospitality, said Glazman and Roytberg, who serve as co-presidents at Fresh.

“For us, it wasn’t really that far off” from working in beauty to starting a hotel, said Roytberg. “Family hospitality is a core value at Fresh. It’s always something that we’ve been really fascinated with. People still have to drive to come to your store to experience a treatment, to buy products — but what if you go beyond? You can connect on a much deeper emotional level with the people.” In 2016, the duo opened the kitchen, bakery and café Bartlett House in Upstate New York, which is still open.

While the hotel is owned by the couple and not affiliated with Fresh or its parent company LVMH, the owners’ beauty background is apparent. The hotel is offering each guest $115 of complimentary full-size Fresh products, including its Seaberry Shampoo and Conditioner, and Sugar Lemon Shower Gel, Body Lotion and Soap. Its gift shop also stocks a limited-edition gender-neutral fragrance created by Glazman in collaboration with Christopher Draghi, the co-founder of local Hudson fragrance brand Source Adage. Rooms at the upscale property are named after creatives including “Architect,” “Artist” and “Writer,” and range from $350-$1,150 a night.

Fresh Beauty used to have a hotel amenity program, but is currently “reevaluating” it and not distributing to other properties, said Glazman, who noted that The Maker had decided to distribute full-size products to cut down on plastic waste. “Sustainability is a very big deal. We are trying to figure out a way to supply products with a minimal amount of packaging.”"
