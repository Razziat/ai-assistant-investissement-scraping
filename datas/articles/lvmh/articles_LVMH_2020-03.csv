The factories that produce perfume and makeup for brands like Christian Dior and Givenchy will be making hand sanitizer starting on Monday.

The French luxury conglomerate will deliver the free disinfectant to French authorities and the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, the largest hospital system in Europe.

LVMH to Distribute Free Hand Sanitizer to French Health Authorities - WWD,"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC10by1kaXN0cmlidXRlLWZyZWUtaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXItdG8tZnJlbmNoLWhlYWx0aC1hdXRob3JpdGllcy0xMjAzNTM5NDQyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said Sunday it will manufacture and distribute hand sanitizer to French health authorities for free in order to fight the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19.

“Given the risk of shortage of hydroalcoholic gel in France, Bernard Arnault has instructed the LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics business to prepare its production sites to manufacture substantial quantities of hydroalcoholic gel to be provided to public authorities,” the company said.

Starting Monday, all the production facilities of the group’s perfumes and cosmetics brands, including Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain and Parfums Givenchy, will produce and distribute bottles of hand sanitizer to be delivered free of charge in France, prioritizing Parisian hospitals.

Since the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the country, French consumers have cleared out stocks of hand sanitizers in pharmacies and grocery stores. In Paris, most pharmacies have had to put up signs informing people that they are fully out of both protective masks and hand sanitizers, two of the main tools used to limit contamination.

French pharmacies are excluded from the government’s forced closure of “nonessential” public spaces to limit the propagation of the virus, which was announced on Saturday.

LVMH Directs Perfume Factories to Make Hand Sanitizer - The Cut,"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy9sdm1oLWRpcmVjdHMtcGVyZnVtZS1mYWN0b3JpZXMtdG8tbWFrZS1oYW5kLXNhbml0aXplci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French factories that produce Guerlain perfumes will temporarily pivot to hand sanitizer.

Please note the story you’re reading was published more than a day ago. COVID-19 news and recommendations change fast: Read the latest here to stay up-to-date. We’ve lifted our paywall on all essential news and updates about the coronavirus.

Hand sanitizer is in short supply and high demand, as people realize the time to curb their disgusting hygiene habits — and also the spread of coronavirus — was yesterday. Countries all around the world have reported shortages, with South Korea slapping hefty fines and even prison sentences on hand-sanitizer hoarders, and Thailand directing citizens to make their own cleansing product. To help mitigate France’s shortage, LVMH — a massive luxury-goods conglomerate encompassing Louis Vuitton, Moët, Hennessy, and more — announced Sunday that three of its largest perfume factories would pivot to hand-sanitizer production.

The directive reportedly came from LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault: Starting Monday, facilities that produce fragrances and cosmetics for Christian Dior, Guerlain, and Givenchy will switch over to hydroalcoholic gel, which will be given to French health authorities and hospitals free of charge.

“Through this initiative,” the company’s statement read, “LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus.”

According to the New York Times, LVMH anticipates it will make 12 tons of hand sanitizer within its first week, and promised in a statement that it would “continue to honor this commitment for as long as necessary.” The Guardian reports that, while France has not yet run out of sanitizer, supplies are “strained.” In France, as in the U.S. and many other countries, the product has reportedly been subject to wild markups. The French government instituted a price cap and some pharmacies have implemented one-bottle-per-person rules, according to the Guardian.

While hand sanitizer is a valuable commodity for disinfecting on the go — and something you can make at home, if you follow specific instructions — consistently washing your hands with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, is the best option of all. Scrub those mitts, keep your distance from others, and — if you can manage it — stay home.

Luxury perfume makers Dior and Givenchy will produce free hand sanitizer for French health authorities - CNN,"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy8xNS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1sdm1oLWRpb3ItaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXItdHJuZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMC8wMy8xNS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1sdm1oLWRpb3ItaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXItdHJuZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

With the reported cases of novel coronavirus in France nearing 4,500 with 91 deaths, some of the country’s most famous luxury brands are switching from perfume to hand sanitizer.

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, the parent company of Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy, wants to help French health authorities by manufacturing hand sanitizer and providing it to them for free.

LVMH said it will use all the production facilities of its perfumes and cosmetics brands to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel, or hand sanitizer, starting Monday.

The gel will be delivered to French health authorities and the Assistance Publique-Hospitaux de Paris, a network of 39 teaching hospitals that treats more than 8 million patients each year, according to its website.

“Through this initiative, LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus,” the company said in a press release.

LVMH’s move comes in the wake of widespread shortages of hand sanitizer across the globe. In the US, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced last week that the state would be producing its own hand sanitizer by employing inmates.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says washing hands with soap and water is still the best way to prevent transmission of the coronavirus. For hand sanitizer to be effective, it must have at least 60% alcohol, according to the CDC."

Companies that usually make liquor and perfume are shifting into hand sanitizer production as people seek ways to disinfect their palms in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The French-based perfume maker LVMH recently announced plans to convert its cosmetics factories into hand sanitizer producers while distilleries in the U.S. are repurposing alcohol to make sanitizing solutions and giving them to customers for free.

LVMH, which produces scents for companies like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, said in a press release Sunday that it intends on producing hand sanitizer at its factories in France for distribution across 39 hospitals in the region.

The decision was made out of worry that there will be a sanitizer shortage in France, the company said. The gel will be delivered for free to French health authorities to combat the spreading virus starting Monday.

“LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus,” the company said in a press release, which was also posted on Twitter.

The move follows news that distilleries in the U.S. are giving out free disinfectant amid the spreading virus, which has killed at least 69 people domestically.

Last week, Old Fourth Distillery in Atlanta posted on Instagram that it plans to hand out free 95% alcohol-based sanitizer to anyone who stopped by and asked.

In Portland, Oregon, Shine Distillery and Grill announced similar plans on Facebook.

Durham Distillery in North Carolina announced a similar program for local hospitality workers on its website.

"Does LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne's (EPA:MC) CEO Pay Matter? - Yahoo Finance","Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2VzLWx2bWgtbW8tdC1oZW5uZXNzeS0xMDA2MzYzOTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault has been the CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC) since 1989. First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at other large companies. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels.

Check out our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne

How Does Bernard Arnault's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?

At the time of writing, our data says that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne has a market cap of €166b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of €8.0m for the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at €1.1m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations over €7.1b and the median CEO total compensation was €3.4m. There aren't very many mega-cap companies, so we had to take a wide range to get a meaningful comparison figure.

Thus we can conclude that Bernard Arnault receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of large companies in the same market as LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the pay is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.

Luxury Perfumer LVMH Is Using Its Factories to Produce Hand Sanitizer Amid the Coronavirus Outbreak - Town & Country,"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9iZWF1dHktcHJvZHVjdHMvYTMxNjQ5MjIwL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWx2bWgtcGVyZnVtZS1mYWN0b3JpZXMtaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the luxury conglomerate which owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Dior, and Givenchy, among many others, is doing its part to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak. In mid-March, the company announced that it will use its perfume factories to manufacture hand sanitizer.

""LVMH will use the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic brands ... to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels from Monday,"" the company said in a statement. ""These gels will be delivered free of charge to the health authorities.""

According to CNN, the company will specifically provide this hand sanitizer to French health authorities and the Assistance Publique-Hospitaux de Paris.

""Through this initiative, LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus,"" reads the company's press release.

Just a few days after the announcement was made public, Romain de Jorna, who works at Hospital Saint-Louis in Paris tweeted a photo of the bottle of LVMH hand sanitizer. Unsurprisingly, it looks very chic:

Per the Financial Times, ""LVMH is on track to donate 12 tonnes of the hand sanitising gel to the 39 hospitals of the Paris system known as the APHP by the end of this week.""

""LVMH will continue to honour this commitment as long as necessary,"" the company told FT in a statement.

The CDC recommends washing your hands to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but if soap and water are unavailable, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can also be effective.

At this point, it's unclear if the company's beauty lines will be affected by the shift in production.

LVMH's announcement came as restaurants, movie theaters, nightclubs, and shops in France were ordered to close following an exponential increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases.

""I have decided to close all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said. ""We must absolutely limit our movements."""

In an effort to battle the pandemic that has hijacked the world as we know it—Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus—luxury conglomerate LVMH, under Bernard Arnault’s leadership, has today announced it will utilize three of its perfume facilities to produce hand sanitizer, in an effort to combat the outbreak. Instead of producing Givenchy, Christian Dior and Guerlain fragrances, these three facilities will make 12 tonnes of sanitizer, which will be produced as quickly as this week.

“I wish to thank LVMH for acting so quickly,” began Paris hospital chief Martine Hirsch, who spoke to AFP. “They made us this offer on Saturday night…and confirmed it on Sunday.”

The LVMH sanitizer will be distributed to 39 public hospitals in the French capital of Paris, and will be done so “at no charge” to the French health authorities, according to The Guardian. This will be a major help in the fight against the coronavirus, as the best defense against its spread is hand washing and—in the event that soap and water are not available—sanitizing. Like many countries across the globe, hand sanitizer has become a scarce product in France, as panic has set in and over-stocking has begun.

LVMH is the umbrella group to 75 luxury Houses across the fashion, wines and spirits, retail, perfumes and cosmetics spaces, among others. Some of their brands include Louis Vuitton, Berluti, Celine, Fendi, FENTY, RIMOWA, Marc Jacobs, Hublot, BVLGARI, Tag Heuer, Zenith, Dom Pérignon, Ruinart, Krug, Benefit Cosmetics, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, and more.

And it's not just hand washing that can help, with anti-bacterial gels becoming the most sought after product in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. With hand sanitiser in high demand (countries around the world have reported shortages whilst South Korea is fining those that hoard it), the inevitable meteoric rise in price has lead to the humble hand gel becoming a luxury product.

.

Now, LVMH (the company that owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Moet & Hennessy, to name just a few) has committed to alleviating the shortage by producing disinfectant gel in place of perfume. On Sunday, the company behind our go-to luxury scents announced that three of its largest perfume factories in France would pivot to disinfectant gel production.



Dior anti-bac gel anyone?

Beginning today, the facilities previously used to produce Guerlain, Dior and Givenchy cosmetics will re-direct production to hydroalcoholic gel that will be distributed to French health authorities and hospitals for free.

In a public statement on the unprecedented business decision LVMH said:

'Through this initiative LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus.'

The luxury conglomerate has also confirmed that it plans to 'continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary'. Here's hoping more large-scale companies commit to providing practical, and essential, support to stop the spread of Coronavirus as soon as possible.

LVMH Says Arnault is Not Looking to Cut Cost by Acquiring Tiffany & Co. on the Open Market - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtc2F5cy1hcm5hdWx0LWlzLW5vdC1sb29raW5nLXRvLWN1dC1jb3N0cy1ieS1hY3F1aXJpbmctdGlmZmFueS1jby1vbi10aGUtb3Blbi1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite recent “rumors,” LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton says that it will not opt to buy Tiffany & Co. shares on the open market in order to snap up ownership of the jewelry company for less than the $16.2 billion price the parties agreed upon in November. According to a statement that the Paris-based luxury goods group issued on Monday morning, reports that it was potentially looking to buy Tiffany & Co.’s stock on the open market amid a coronavirus-driven slump have lead it to confirming that it “is currently committed not to buy Tiffany shares [on the open market] … in accordance with the [November] agreement.”

Bloomberg reported last week that “people familiar with the matter” revealed that LVMH had “discussed the idea” of purchasing shares on the market with Tiffany’s board, “which could grant permission for the potential purchases to go ahead after earnings,” while noting that LVMH had “not made a final decision on whether to proceed with selective market buying and is discussing possible legal hurdles to the idea.”

The “unusual step,” as Bloomberg characterized it, which comes as the iconic New York-based jewelry brand’s NYSE-listed shares are selling for less than the agreed-upon takeover price, would have enabled the Paris-based group to capture “a near 13 percent discount at recent prices.” Although, it would also “underscore LVMH Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault’s commitment to the deal.”

Bloomberg’s Andrea Felsted stated in a separate article over the weekend that that “Tiffany’s stock price [has been] supported by the $135-a-share [deal with LVMH], but touched a year-to-date low of about $111 this [past] week.” Such a “large spread suggests an element of uncertainty the deal will actually close.” While financing the deal in light of the market downturn should not be an issue, Felsted says “the question is whether there is any provision in the fine print of the deal agreement that LVMH lawyers could use to walk away — and whether Arnault would even want to if there was.”

“Wriggling off the hook,” she writes, “would damage Arnault’s reputation” – although it is worth noting that Arnault is known as an aggressive and even ruthless business builder, hence his “‘wolf-in-cashmere clothing” industry nickname, thanks to various hostile takeover attempts in the past, including his group’s (unsuccessful) play for Gucci. It would also “send a terrible message to investors about the strength of LVMH,” which seemed to support reports that the richest man in fashion was looking for other ways “to try to bring down the overall cost of the deal, without trying to renegotiate, or pressing the panic button.”

LVMH’s full statement reads as follows: “Rumors circulated recently indicating that LVMH would consider buying Tiffany shares on the open market. These rumors lead LVMH to recall that, in accordance with the agreement concluded with Tiffany in November 2019, LVMH is currently committed not to buy Tiffany shares.”"

PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH <LVMH.PA> said on Monday it would not buy Tiffany shares <TIF.N> on the open market, a move that would have potentially enabled it to pursue its agreement to buy the U.S. jeweller at a lower price than the one agreed last year.

Bloomberg reported last week that the French luxury goods group was now considering buying shares in Tiffany on the market, following its deal last November to buy the company for $16.2 billion, or $135 a share.

Stock markets have tumbled worldwide as the coronavirus pandemic pushes several governments in Europe and elsewhere to order unprecedented shutdowns to try and contain its spread.

""Rumours circulated recently indicating that LVMH would consider buying Tiffany shares on the open market,"" the company said in a statement. ""These rumours lead LVMH to recall that, in accordance with the agreement concluded with Tiffany in November 2019, LVMH is currently committed not to buy Tiffany shares.""

Such a move would have been highly unusual, though potentially feasible with Tiffany's blessing.

The jeweller last week forecast a significant hit to its results this year, as it temporarily closes several outlets, including its iconic flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York.

Tiffany shares closed at $125 each on Friday.

LVMH Moët Hennessy, the French company behind major brands like Louis Vuitton, Fenty Beauty, and Benefit Cosmetics, announced Sunday its factories that normally manufacture perfume will shift to manufacturing hand sanitizer gel.

""LVMH will use the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic brands ... to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels from Monday,"" the company said in a statement, according to Reuters.

The company said it would be delivering the products to French healthcare authorities for free. According to March 12 data from the World Health Organization, France so far has dealt with 2269 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus that have led to 48 deaths.

The move comes amid a global shortage of alcohol-based sanitizers, which have been recommended by the CDC as a tool to avoid the spread of COVID-19. According to Bloomberg, a shortage of alcohol-based sanitizers has prompted policy changes by the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA encouraged licensed pharmacists and doctors to create their own hand sanitizers and sell them to customers amid a shortage in the US. The agency said over the weekend that since pharmacists and doctors ""are more familiar with standards and methods for producing drug products than ""untrained"" consumers.

The agency requires pharmacists and doctors to create the sanitizer using its recipe that calls for specific quantities of ingredients like alcohol, glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, and sterile water, Bloomberg reported.

As Business Insider reported, a pharmacy in New York City last week offered its customers instructions on how they could make their own hand sanitizer after it sold out of the product — but provided an inaccurate recipe that did not meet CDC guidelines.

Titos Handmade Vodka last month had to tell customers that its vodka could not be used as a hand sanitizer under CDC guidelines after people on social media shared they were using it as a sanitizer. Titos Vodka contains just 40% alcohol whereas the CDC requires an alcohol-based hand sanitizer contains 60% alcohol.

On March 9, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the state was using labor from prison inmates to manufacture 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer each week.

The clip showed the rapper hugging his best friend Virgil Abloh after the designer’s debut Louis Vuitton show. The tender moment captured the pair crying into each other’s arms, appearing to congratulate each other on what they had achieved – but it wasn’t long before rumours started to swirl that West himself was disappointed that he hadn't scored the Vuitton gig.

Now, the the iconoclastic musician has spoken about his feelings on that moment, in a new interview with WSJ. Magazine. Explaining that Vuitton’s parent comany, LVMH, once offered to back his own label Yeezy after its first show in New York, he said it was “pretty devastating” when LVMH pulled out of the deal without comment. West then went on to mention LVMH’s partnership with Rihanna, who also got the deal he wanted with her Fenty clothing line, which launched last year.

He did, however, go on to speak about Abloh’s appointment as the menswear artistic director of Louis Vuitton in a positive light. “One of my best friends was crowned king. Virgil. Louis Vuitton. We grew up on Louis Vuitton – Marc Jacobs duffels,” West said. “My best friend.”

Also going on to compare Yeezy to the likes of Apple and McDonalds (do we expect anything less now?), West also detailed his quest for the perfect hoodie, an item he calls “arguably the most important piece of apparel of the last decade.” A thought he may not be alone with.

Earlier this year, West took over Paris Fashion Week, with his singing daughter North, to hold a surprise show for his Yeezy Season 8 presentation. Abloh also returned to PFW this season with a cloud-strewn Louis Vuitton show and an eclectic Off-White presentation.

LVMH Unveils Plans for Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills Courier Worldwide Exclusive - Beverly Hills Courier,"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYmV2ZXJseWhpbGxzY291cmllci5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy8xMy9sdm1oLXVudmVpbHMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWNoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLWNvdXJpZXItd29ybGR3aWRlLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Beverly Hills Courier has obtained exclusive first details about the development plan submitted by LVMH for Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills. The ultra-luxury hospitality, retail and dining project is expected to open on Rodeo Drive in 2025. Plans call for an innovative, yet classic 115-guestroom bespoke hotel, as well as ground-floor LVMH retail establishments and exclusive dining venues. Additional features include rooftop pools, a private club and expansive penthouse space.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is the world leader in luxury, comprised of 75 Maisons in five key sectors of the luxury market. Its portfolio of one-of-a-kind Cheval Blanc properties is acclaimed for combining the French art of hospitality with uncompromising privacy, exclusivity and an intimate sense of place. Cheval Blanc Courchevel in the French Alps, Cheval Blanc Randheli in the Maldives, Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France in the French West Indies and Cheval Blanc St-Tropez have transformed the concept of high-end hotels for the world’s most discerning guests. A Paris property is set to open this spring and additional projects are in the pipeline in London and Seychelles.

LVMH has now chosen Beverly Hills as the site of its first Cheval Blanc in the United States.

It is a testament to the company’s belief in Beverly Hills as one of the world’s premier locations, and in Rodeo Drive as its most exciting focal point. LVMH is a longtime stakeholder, taxpayer and employer on Rodeo Drive, all of which underscores a key factor distinguishing their proposal. This is not a case where the applicant is a developer interested in flipping the project once completed. LVMH plans to build and operate the property as the latest in its series of investments in Beverly Hills. Those investments are substantial. LVMH currently owns or leases 18 properties in the City, employing more than 240 people through brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Rimowa, Bulgari, Loro Piana, Hublot, Berluti and Sephora brands. By mid-2020, LVMH is expected to close on its acquisition of Tiffany.

Overview of Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills

The future Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills will occupy four contiguous parcels bordering Rodeo Drive, Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive. Namely: the former Brooks Brothers building which housed the popular “Louis Vuitton X Exhibition” in 2019; Celine Rodeo Drive; the former Paley Center for Media and the property at 449 N. Beverly Drive.

Over the next five years, the above- named parcels are set to transform into an impressive stone-clad structure designed to fit seamlessly into the existing landscape of Beverly Hills. Its principal facade will face Little Santa Monica Boulevard and an innovative pedestrian plaza with a custom art piece will energize the corner of Little Santa Monica and Rodeo Drive. A porte cochere with multi-level landscaping will provide access to the property, while the alleyway between Beverly and Rodeo Drives will become a new thoroughfare. And on the Beverly Drive-Little Santa Monica corner, a two-story dining venue will welcome hotel guests and residents alike.

Brand hallmarks of Cheval Blanc include small room count, exceptional food and beverage offerings, innovative spas and wellness programs and customized design and art concepts. In keeping with a boutique, residential approach, the brand does not offer banquet facilities, event facilities, or group business. Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills is expected to showcase those brand hallmarks, while imparting the unique imprint of its Beverly Hills setting.

Peter Marino Architect

LVMH has commissioned architect Peter Marino to design Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills. Known for his award-winning retail, residential, cultural, and hospitality projects worldwide, he has long-standing relationships with both the City and LVMH. He received his first Excellence in Design Award from the Architectural Commission of the City of Beverly Hills in 1994 and his most recent award from the City in 2015 for the adjacent Louis Vuitton building on Rodeo Drive. Marino’s work includes the Dior store and the Fendi store on Rodeo Drive, which received an American Institute of Architect’s Citation for Design.

“Our intention was to conceive a vibrant addition to the City of Beverly Hills and a new icon for both the City and Cheval Blanc,” Marino said. “Our approach started with the location and context, of Beverly Hills, resulting in an innovative, modern, Southern California design. Working with artists is an essential aspect of my work, and site-specific artworks are being commissioned for the new hotel, both inside and out.”

Marino has distinguished himself for integrating art within his designs, having commissioned over 300 site specific works for his projects. Unique artworks are set to play a central role in the design of Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills. Specially commissioned art pieces will be included throughout the interior and exterior of the hotel, including at the new pedestrian plaza.

“We are delighted to announce the first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S., destined for the heart of Beverly Hills. LVMH has a long and successful presence on Rodeo Drive and we look forward to expanding our role in the City with this exceptional new destination,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH. “Peter Marino has designed a magnificent hotel that will offer unrivaled hospitality, as well as dining and retail locations, and enhance Rodeo Drive’s reputation as an unparalleled luxury destination.”

LVMH has engaged local architect and planner Gruen Associates to work on the project. Gruen has extensive experience in Beverly Hills and has collaborated with Peter Marino on many award-winning projects within the Beverly Hills Business Triangle over the past decades.

Economic Effects

LVMH is positioning the project as a major economic driver that will reinforce Beverly Hills’ status as an iconic commercial destination. The company’s high-caliber restaurants and flagship retail destinations will enliven the entire business community. Moreover, the vibrant ground floor pedestrian space will complement the goals of the City’s BOLD Initiative year-round.

Cheval Blanc is also poised to deliver high-quality permanent jobs, and with them, specialized training in the key component of “Art de Recevoir” for which Cheval Blanc is famous. Along with bringing significant tax revenue each year, the hotel will also create hundreds of construction jobs.

And on the environmental front, LVMH has emphasized measures to embrace environmental sustainability. For example, the project is designed to achieve the rating of LEED Silver or better. Sustainability features will include electric vehicle charging stations, bicycle parking, provisions for rooftop solar collectors, and the recycling of at least 50 percent of demolition and construction materials.

The Process

The proposal submitted by LVMH to the City’s Planning Department sets a multi-year process in motion. As with other similar projects, it contemplates a General Plan amendment, a Specific Plan (which guides the implementation of the General Plan as amended) and a Development Agreement with the City.

Moving forward, the Planning Department staff will need time to review the application for completeness, and the City will then solicit bids from environmental consultants to be retained for the project under the City’s control.

The City is required to analyze the project under the California Environmental Quality Act, known as CEQA. Environmental review and public hearings take place during this time, and thanks to CEQA the process goes forward with a strong emphasis on transparency and responsiveness to community concerns. The community will be invited to participate in the environmental review process from the beginning, when the scope of the review is decided. The draft environmental impact report (EIR) will also be available for public review and comment, and the City is required to respond to those comments prior to holding public hearings on the project. In fact, it is obligated to identify any significant environmental impacts and all feasible mitigation measures in the EIR.

For its part, LVMH has stated that it is committed to fostering a productive dialogue with neighbors and other stakeholders about the project and intends to pursue the necessary approvals in an inclusive and transparent manner.

“Our project team is committed to ensuring that the hotel integrates naturally with the surrounding community, with the goal of being a great neighbor for the entire City. To achieve this, we are taking steps to engage directly with neighbors and other stakeholders to foster a productive dialogue about the project,” said Anish Melwani, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, Inc. in the U.S.

He added: “We wish to extend our deep thanks to everyone at the City of Beverly Hills for their valuable feedback on our proposal.”

This City-led environmental review and approval process is expected to take approximately 18 months.

General Plan Amendment

The EIR will take into account the request by LVMH for a General Plan amendment to allow for the project’s height. Such requests are not uncommon for projects of this scope. While the Business Triangle district is characterized by low rise retail in the City’s General Plan and Zoning Code, there are exceptions contemplated for certain projects. Strategic locations known as “anchor locations” are considered appropriate candidates for an amendment if they provide for greater intensity of use that results in a synergistic revitalization of the neighborhood.

LVMH believes that its proposed project meets the definition of such an anchor location. It will serve as an inner gateway to the northern end of Rodeo Drive, on the border of the Business Triangle. It will benefit other nearby businesses by increasing foot traffic in the area, raising the Business Triangle’s global profile and serving as a modern counterweight at one end of the City’s most famous destinations.

LVMH has also requested a Development Agreement with the City, another typical step in projects of this nature. The purpose of such agreements is to vest the project’s approvals for the duration of the multi-year construction process to protect LVMH’s considerable investment. California law provides that cities can negotiate Development Agreements that lock in vested rights for a proposed project. In doing so, the City can negotiate for benefits that will inure directly to the general fund. LVMH is expected to engage with the City in separate business negotiations for the Development Agreement.

Still to come after completion of the General Plan Amendment, Final EIR and Development Agreement will be Architectural Commission approval of the final design. This stage will contemplate specific details of the project, down to the type of stone used on the external façade. LVMH will then pull the requisite building permits, with groundbreaking still a few years away, at the earliest.

Those interested in reviewing the submitted plans and application materials for Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills may make a request for public inspection with the Beverly Hills Planning Department. The Beverly Hills Courier will continue to follow the progress of this and other notable projects affecting the landscape of the City."

“I wish to thank them for their involvement and their support to young creation. The prize is an incredible opportunity for these young designers to be appraised by them and to enjoy their advice,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the LMVH Prize and a key talent scout at the family-controlled group.

The executive announced the composition of the jury alongside the eight finalists for the award: Ahluwalia; Casablanca; Chopova Lowena; Nicholas Daley; Peter Do; Sindiso Khumalo; Supriya Lele and Tomo Koizumi.

Rihanna — or Robyn Rihanna Fenty, as she is known professionally — is one of the latest designers in the LVMH fold, after launching her Fenty label last May in a joint venture with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi.

McCartney is another recent arrival, having sold a minority stake in her business to LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault last July. Abloh has been creative director of men’s wear at Vuitton since March 2018, but was not selected for jury duty last year.

The other jury members are Jonathan Anderson; Kris Van Assche; Nicolas Ghesquière; Maria Grazia Chiuri; Marc Jacobs; Clare Waight Keller; Sidney Toledano, chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group; Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to Bernard Arnault and head of corporate philanthropy at LVMH, and Delphine Arnault.

The finalists were selected by a panel of 68 experts during a two-day showroom event during Paris Fashion Week, although the popular cocktail celebrating the semifinalists was canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

“This year, once more, the semi-finalists impressed us with their creativity and their commitment to creating clothes that are respectful of the environment,” Arnault said, noting that five of the finalists design women’s wear, and the remaining three men’s wear.

Following the success of Thebe Magugu, the winner of the 2019 edition, the prize is welcoming another South African designer among the finalists. Cape Town-based Sindiso Khumalo said she wants to use her clothes to tell more positive, forward-thinking stories about Africa.

Her latest collection was inspired by West African princess Sara Forbes Bonetta, who was rescued from slavery to become a goddaughter of Britain’s Queen Victoria, with Sunday best poplin dresses with charming frills; woven jackets, and a prom dress featuring voluminous taffeta.

“I make everything myself in Cape Town. Everything from the weaving techniques we use to the stories of our muses is about African heritage,” said Khumalo.

Several finalists have Instagram to thank for the career-making opportunity. Among them, Tomo Koizumi, Chopova Lowena and Peter Do have all leveraged social media in different ways.

Koizumi is perhaps the most famous example: After Vogue talent scout Sara Maino posted one of his colorful, oversize ruffled designs on Instagram in October 2018, things quickly snowballed. Giles Deacon and Gwendoline Christie flagged it to stylist Katie Grand, who brought him to New York to make his debut.

“She DM’ed me less than a month before my first show,” Koizumi said of the display, held at the Marc Jacobs store on Madison Avenue last February with models including Karen Elson, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Rowan Blanchard and Christie. The images promptly went viral.

Koizumi, who makes only custom dresses, has since seen his designs worn by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Sophie Turner, and two outfits featured in the “Camp: Notes on Fashion” exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. If he takes home the LVMH Prize, he plans to launch a commercial collection.

Do, who won a graduate award at the inaugural LVMH Prize in 2014, said the Internet has been crucial to building his U.S.-based label. “We are a Millennial brand. I met all of my members through Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram,” he said of his staff of 12. “The brand feels like it was built on the Internet.”

Last year, online retailer 24S celebrated the prize by distributing a capsule collection of outfits designed by the eight finalists, in addition to a selection of pieces from Magugu’s collection, available now.

“This year, 24S and Matchesfashion will support the finalists of the LVMH Prize and help them gain international exposure,” LVMH said, without providing additional details."
What is Bernard Arnault's net worth? - Fox Business,"Mon, 02 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtbmV0LXdvcnRo0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1uZXQtd29ydGguYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault is a French business magnate, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE, LVMH, the world's largest luxury-goods company.

Heading up some of the most premium brands on the planet surely must pay a pretty penny, but how much are Arnault and his family worth?

Arnault's father, Jean Leon, was a successful manufacturer and the owner of the civil engineering company Ferret-Savinel. Arnault junior joined his father's company in 1971. By 1976 Arnault, now director of company development, had convinced his father to liquidate the company's construction wing, refocusing the business to be more lucrative.

WHO IS THE RICHEST BILLIONAIRE IN THE WORLD?

The liquidation of the construction wing gave the Arnaults 40 million Fr (French francs), which they invested into their real estate business. Arnault then went on to succeed his father as president of Ferret-Savinel in 1979.

In 1981, Arnault and his family moved for a time to the US. While here he developed condominiums in Palm Beach, Florida, helping to forge a North America branch of the Arnault property business. He returned to France in 1983.

When the textile firm Boussac Saint-Frères went bankrupt, Arnault saw his opportunity to diversify his company. The textile company was made up of several businesses, including couture house Christian Dior. Arnault joined forces with Antoine Bernheim, managing partner of investment firm Lazard Frères, who orchestrated the funds for the acquisition of Boussac.

As a result, Arnault invested around $15 million of his own money, with Bernheim helping to raise the remaining sum of the $80 million buyout of Boussac Saint-Frères.

In 1987, Henri Racamier invited Arnault to invest in LVMH, a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate based in Paris. By 1990, Arnault started to force out Racamier while adding more fashion companies into LVHM's portfolio. Brands such as Givenchy, Moet & Chandon, Berluti, Céline, Sephora and Kenzo all came under the LVHM umbrella.

Because of his visionary foresight and business acumen, taking failing fashion brands and rejuvenating them, Arnault was called ""The Pope of Fashion"".

As the 1990s rolled on, Arnault oversaw the continued expansion of LVMH, acquiring several more companies, including Guerlain in 1994, Loewe in 1996, Marc Jacobs and Sephora in 1997, and Thomas Pink in 1999.

Some of LVMH's takeovers of brands were seen as aggressive by some corners of the media, and it was this perceived determination that earned him the moniker of ""Frances's wolf-in-cashmere.""

2019 was a very good year for Arnault, who earned an estimated profit of €35.1 billion (about $38.6 billion). This was the same year that Arnault overtook Jeff Bezos on the world's richest list on Dec. 16, 2019. This was shortly after LMVH had acquired premium jewelery company Tiffany & Co. causing stocks to rise.

LVMH Retools Perfume and Cosmetic Factories to Make Free Hand Sanitizer - Nasdaq,"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHZtaC1yZXRvb2xzLXBlcmZ1bWUtYW5kLWNvc21ldGljLWZhY3Rvcmllcy10by1tYWtlLWZyZWUtaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXItMjAyMC0wMy0xN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Global luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC: LVMUY) began producing hand sanitizer on Monday at factories that typically produce perfume and cosmetics for brands such as Christian Dior and Givenchy.

LVMH, which also owns Sephora and Guerlain, says it will distribute the product to health authorities and hospitals free of charge. In a statement announcing the retooling, the conglomerate said, ""LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities.""

Keep it clean

France has ordered all restaurants, retailers, and non-essential stores to close in a bid to halt the progression of the COVID-19 virus, but supermarkets, pharmacies, and other similar outlets remain open.

A spokeswoman for the Paris hospital system said supplies of hydroalcoholic gel, otherwise known as hand sanitizer, are ""strained,"" though hospitals have not yet run out of it.

""Through this initiative, LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus,"" the luxury goods conglomerate said.

In the U.S., hand sanitizer is also in short supply. One Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) third-party seller has been suspended after hoarding almost 18,000 bottles of hand sanitizer in a bid to sell them at greatly marked up prices. After the Tennessee attorney general's office launched an investigation into him for price gouging, he donated the supplies to a local church.

Amazon removed the seller's listing and warned other third-party sellers their accounts will be suspended if they engage in similar conduct. It has removed over 1 million items for false claims and high prices.

LVMH Sets Plans for Cheval Blanc Hotel on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills - WWD,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY2hldmFsLWJsYW5jLWhvdGVsLXJvZGVvLWRyaXZlLWJldmVybHktaGlsbHMtMTIwMzUzOTkyNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has unveiled plans to open the first U.S. location of the Cheval Blanc Hotel in Beverly Hills. This confirms a report in WWD from March 2019.

The property will be designed by architect Peter Marino, and is expected to open in 2025, following Cheval Blanc hotels at LVMH’s La Samaritaine complex in Paris, currently scheduled for April, and in London’s Mayfair, scheduled for 2022.

The Los Angeles hotel will sit at the the intersection of Rodeo Drive, Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Boulevard, encompassing three contiguous parcels of land that the luxury giant has been collecting over the past two years.

In March 2018, LVMH bought a 6,200-square-foot empty retail space at 456 North Rodeo Drive for $110 million. Then, in September, the luxury powerhouse headed by billionaire Bernard Arnault purchased 468 North Rodeo Drive, the 22,250-square-foot, multistory building at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard that was previously occupied by Brooks Brothers, for $245 million from the trust of the family of Margaret J. Anderson, who built the pink stucco Beverly Hills Hotel. In November, LVMH scooped up the 26,523-square-foot Paley Center for Media museum behind the store, at 465 North Beverly Drive, from New York private real estate investment firm Jenel Management for $80 million. Together, the parcels create more than 50,000 square feet of real estate on which to build.

The principal façade will be along Little Santa Monica Boulevard, featuring a port cochere with multilevel landscaping. A pedestrian plaza with a custom art piece will welcome pedestrians at the corner of Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. The hotel will include 115 guest rooms, rooftop pools, a private penthouse pool and a private club, according to a release.

Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills will create an estimated 400 permanent new jobs. It is the latest in a series of investments in Beverly Hills by LVMH, which owns or leases 18 properties in the area, employing more than 240 people and paying $7.2 million in property taxes in 2019, according to a company statement. Total tax revenue from LVMH’s Beverly Hills properties was $26.7 million in 2019. LVMH’s acquisition of Tiffany & Co. will increase those figures.

“We are delighted to announce the first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S., destined for the heart of Beverly Hills. LVMH has a long and successful presence on Rodeo Drive and we look forward to expanding our role in the City with this exceptional new destination,” said Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH. “Peter Marino has designed a magnificent hotel that will offer unrivaled hospitality, as well as dining and retail locations, and enhance Rodeo Drive’s reputation as an unparalleled luxury destination.”

Marino received his first Excellence in Design Award from the architectural commission of the city of Beverly Hills in 1994 and his most recent award from the city in 2015 for the Louis Vuitton building on Rodeo Drive. His work includes the Fendi and Chanel stores on Rodeo Drive.

Although retail real estate can be finicky in Los Angeles, the famed Beverly Hills shopping thoroughfare has been a bright spot. Christian Louboutin recently revealed he is moving his flagship from Robertson Boulevard to Rodeo Drive, where L.A. designer Mike Amiri will open his first store later this year. Gucci just opened a dedicated men’s boutique and Gucci Osteria restaurant. In recent years, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga both moved from Melrose Avenue to Rodeo, Saint Laurent added a second store (one for men and one for women), and Goyard opened a flagship. And Louis Vuitton had success driving traffic to the street last year with its 10-room Louis Vuitton X pop-up, showcasing the house’s 160-year history of collaborations with artists from Sol LeWitt to Jeff Koons to L.A.’s Alex Israel, in the same spot where the Cheval Blanc hotel will sit.

The art theme will carry over to the new property. “Our intention was to conceive a vibrant addition to the City of Beverly Hills and a new icon for both the city and Cheval Blanc,” Marino said. “Our approach started with the location and context of Beverly Hills, resulting in an innovative, modern, Southern California design. Working with artists is an essential aspect of my work, and site-specific artworks are being commissioned for the new hotel, both inside and out.”

Commissioned art pieces will decorate the interior and exterior of the hotel, including at the new pedestrian plaza. The project will implement a variety of green construction standards designed to achieve the rating of LEED silver or better, according to the release, including electric vehicle charging stations, bicycle parking, provisions for rooftop solar collectors, and the recycling of at least 50 percent of demolition and construction materials.

The French luxury goods firm opened the first Cheval Blanc hotel in 2006, located in the ski resort of Courchevel in the French Alps. Three other hotels complete the roster: Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France in the Caribbean, Cheval Blanc Randheli in the Maldives and the recently acquired Cheval Blanc St-Tropez, set to open in May. The Cheval Blanc Paris, also designed by Marino, will be the first time the concept is applied to a city.

Over the past few years, LVMH has been ramping up investment in the hospitality sector, purchasing Belmond Ltd. for $2.6 billion, with a portfolio of 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties, including New York’s 21 Club, the Orient Express and Royal Scotsman trains. The group also owns the six Bulgari hotels."
"Casablanca's Charaf Tajer Talks New Balance Collab, LVMH Prize, and Cool Grandad Style - Complex","Mon, 09 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvbWlrZS1kZXN0ZWZhbm8vY2FzYWJsYW5jYS1uZXctYmFsYW5jZS0zMjctY2hhcmFmLXRhamVyLWludGVydmlld9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“It’s an honor to partner with New Balance on this exciting new style as Casablanca’s first design collaboration,” Tajer says in an official press release. “I know the brand works with few fashion houses so to be chosen to do this with a new silhouette is so special and unique for me.”

We got a chance to speak with Tajer ahead of his momentous New Balance release next month to discuss his inspiration for the collaboration, desire for people to appreciate the product for more than just the hype, his thoughts on being a semi-finalist for the prestigious LVMH prize, and more.

You debuted the New Balance 327 in Paris. What was your reaction to seeing them on the runway for the first time?

People were very surprised to see a new shape. We announced it just a day before that without showing the product. We showed [the 327] during the runway in Paris and had a lot of reactions online after the buyers came to the showroom. The people were very excited. It's quite rare to have that kind of collaboration with New Balance, but even more because it's an absolutely new shape. To have the opportunity to create an absolutely new New Balance from scratch, it's fantastic. The idea of having a totally new shape was so exciting to me. So when I saw it for the first time, and when I received the first samples and all of that, I was so excited. I was waiting to see the reaction after the fashion show and it has only been super positive. I mean the whole reaction was fantastic.

Do you view a sneaker collaboration as an important benchmark for a brand?

Yeah. It's the first collaboration that we're doing with Casablanca, so it's important. But it depends on if it's justified and it makes sense between the two brands or not. I think the New Balance 327 really completes the Casablanca look and it's really matching and merging with our collection. It really makes sense for us to have it. Any collab has to make sense. And this one really makes sense. It looks so natural. The pair looks so Casablanca.

When you started Casablanca, did you always see footwear being a part of the offering that you would give to customers?

For me, Casablanca is a global brand. Casablanca can be applied to anything because it's more like an idea, it's more a way of thinking. This style can be applied to anything. So yes, it can be applied to a shoe, but it also can be applied to an apartment, or a car. So yes, footwear was only natural for us to make.

What inspired the 327? What was the design process like for you?

So the idea and the inspiration behind this shoe is Italian sport of the ‘70s, and also a little bit of ‘70s automobiles, things like the vintage Italian sports cars from the ‘70s. For me, we wanted to go as far as possible from modern sports, and the modern way of designing sneakers, and we wanted to do something that is pretty timeless. I would say this is the grandpa style, it's the grandpa shoe, like the cool Italian grandad shoe. I like the idea of how the Italians in the ‘70s were having their own designs for sports, so I wanted to apply that vision to this pair."
Coronavirus: Louis Vuitton owner to make hand sanitiser for hospitals - Sky News,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3duZXItdG8tbWFrZS1oYW5kLXNhbml0aXNlci1mb3ItaG9zcGl0YWxzLTExOTU4MTcw0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNreS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1wL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3duZXItdG8tbWFrZS1oYW5kLXNhbml0aXNlci1mb3ItaG9zcGl0YWxzLTExOTU4MTcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH will start making hand sanitiser for hospitals to stave off a national shortage across France as the coronavirus outbreak escalates.

The French luxury goods group, which owns fashion house Louis Vuitton, announced it would manufacture the disinfectant gel using the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic gels from Monday.

""These gels will be delivered free of charge to the health authorities,"" LVMH said in a statement, in particular the 39 public hospitals in Paris.

The company, which also owns well known brands including champagne maker Moet & Chandon and jeweller Bulgari, will produce 12 tonnes of sanitiser this week instead of the usual Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy fragrances and cosmetics made at its three French sites.

""LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities,"" the group added.

Meanwhile, French airports group ADP said it would be considering closing down some areas in its main Paris airports to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, adding it was expecting a major financial hit due to the virus.

France's Public Health Authority reported 36 new deaths from coronavirus on Sunday, taking the total to 127.

It said there had been an increase of more than 1,000 cases of infection as the country braces for the introduction of stricter measures to slow down the spread of the virus.

The country has closed its restaurants, cafes and non-essential stores and many pharmacies have restricted customers to one small bottle of sanitiser per person.

Luxury’s Hidden Indian Supply Chain - The New York Times,"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvMTEvc3R5bGUvZGlvci1zYWludC1sYXVyZW50LWluZGlhbi1sYWJvci1leHBsb2l0YXRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MUMBAI, India — At the top of a staircase covered in dirt and sequins, several dozen Indian artisans hunched over yards of fabric, using needles to embroider garments for the world’s most powerful fashion brands.

They sewed without health benefits in a multiroom factory with caged windows and no emergency exit, where they earned a few dollars a day completing subcontracted orders for international designers. When night fell, some slept on the floor.

They were not working for a factory employed by fast fashion brands: companies whose business model is premised on producing trendy clothing as cheaply as possible and whose supply chain issues came under scrutiny in 2013. That was when the deadliest garment industry disaster in history, the Rana Plaza factory collapse, killed more than 1,100 Bangladeshi workers.

Their products were destined for Dior and Saint Laurent, among other luxury names.

Unknown to most consumers, the expensive, glittering brands of runways in Paris and Milan also indirectly employ thousands of workers in the developing world. In Mumbai, scores of ateliers and export houses act as middlemen between the brands and highly skilled artisans, while also providing services like design, sampling and garment production.

As with fast fashion retailers, many luxury brands do not own all of their own production facilities, and instead contract with independent factories to make their garments or embroider them. And like fast fashion, they too have woken up to potential dangers with that system.

In 2016, a group of luxury houses introduced the Utthan pact, an ambitious and secretive compliance project aimed at ensuring factory safety in Mumbai and elevating Indian embroiderers. Among the signatories were Kering (owner of labels including Gucci and Saint Laurent); LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (owner of Fendi and Christian Dior); and two British fashion houses, Burberry and Mulberry. The pact had an initial three-year timeline but was not legally binding."

High-End Brands Like LVMH Are Pitching In to Make Hand Sanitizer - Dwell,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3ZWxsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2x2bWgtaGlnaC1lbmQtYnJhbmRzLXByb2R1Y2UtaGFuZC1zYW5pdGl6ZXItNjNkNjllYWLSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5kd2VsbC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbHZtaC1oaWdoLWVuZC1icmFuZHMtcHJvZHVjZS1oYW5kLXNhbml0aXplci02M2Q2OWVhYg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods company LVMH, which produces fragrances for Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Guerlain, is pivoting to hand sanitizer—and it expects to provide the French government with a whopping 12 tons of hydroalcoholic gel by the end of this week. Other companies that work with alcohol-based products are also lending a hand to combat COVID-19.

Sigil's one-ounce bottle contains a simple blend of alcohol and essential oils.

Sigil Scent, an American fragrance maker that uses essential oils, is launching a new hand sanitizer to provide ""emotional, mental, and physical comfort in these trying times,"" according to their website. The bottles are fairly priced at cost, and customers can choose between ""Grounded"" or ""Uplifting"" fragrances—at times like these, there’s a need for both. Carts are limited to three bottles per person to discourage hoarding, and customers can also donate $5 to the L.A. LGBTQ Center’s food pantry at checkout.



Los Angeles–based distillers AMASS started making hand wash in-house to keep employees safe. When they talked about it on Instagram, fans and customers of the brand wanted their own bottles.

When followers of AMASS—a gin and vodka distillery based in Los Angeles—saw that the company had crafted a no-water hand wash to keep their employees safe, they requested it en mass—and the company delivered.

""The ingredients are inspired by the ‘four thieves recipe,’"" says master distiller Morgan McLachlan. ""It’s a blend of botanicals believed to prevent the spread of the plague in medieval Europe."" The two-ounce bottle is infused with cinnamon, allspice, clove, and eucalyptus, balancing medieval folklore with meeting the CDC’s standards for actual germ killing."

Luxury Brands Burn Unsold Goods. What Should They Do Instead? - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy1idXJuLXVuc29sZC1nb29kcy13aGF0LXNob3VsZC10aGV5LWRvLWluc3RlYWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — Last year, Burberry dressed more than 250 unemployed women — some homeless, others fresh out of prison, others simply having difficulty finding work — for job interviews that could change their fortune.

But this isn't simply a charity case. The British brand donated these wares to Smart Works, an organisation that supplies free clothes for interviews, not only because it was a nice addition to its corporate responsibility agenda, but because it has to find new ways to offload unsold stock, once destined for the incinerator.

Fashion is a business rife with leftovers. No matter how cool or in-demand a brand is, at the end of the sales season there will be some styles that don't sell as well as others, leaving the label to figure out what to do with the extras. Even a combination of the best brand merchandisers, savvy designers and artificial intelligence can't predict exactly what will and won't sell. Until widespread on-demand manufacturing becomes a reality, there will be unsold inventory.

But now the pressure on the luxury industry to find new solutions is growing, as consumers condemn brands who incinerate product or dump it in the landfill, and governments legislate to stop the act.

In France, new laws banning brands from burning or dumping unsold clothing will affect the big groups — including LVMH and Kering — in particular, as they own a large-and-growing percentage of megabrands generating billions of dollars in sales and producing billions of dollars in inventory each year. Now, brands must either recycle or donate products, according to the new “anti-waste and circular economy” law set to be implemented by the end of 2021. It includes fines of up to €15,000 ($17,050) for illegal dumping. (Though just how stringently it will be enforced is unknown.)

The scale of the problem is huge. Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca estimates a “best-case scenario” is that luxury brands will be left with end-of-season unsold inventory worth 10-to-13 percent of full-price sales. The French government said between 10,000 and 20,000 tonnes of textile products are destroyed every year in France, equivalent to the weight of two Eiffel towers.

It's the biggest open secret in the fashion industry, because it proves how inefficient the current system is.

“It’s the biggest open secret in the fashion industry, because it proves how inefficient the current system is; that it’s cheaper to burn these amazing products than to produce less,” said Orsola de Castro, co-founder of advocacy group Fashion Revolution. “We know they burn on at many points, not just end stock, but from the design studios to the fabrics with logos — it’s constant. We demonise fast fashion, without looking at the reality. Luxury isn’t slow, they are using materials that are just as polluting and they are producing plenty.”

For an industry based upon the perception of exclusivity, incineration worked because it protected brands from heavy discounting, grey market sales in unsavoury stores and outlets, and counterfeiters. But now that’s off the table, there is a clear imperative to find new solutions.

This is a “new challenge for brands,” said Bernstein’s Solca. “There is still work to do on this front – especially in Paris.”

Burberry was a first-mover in the luxury sector with its public commitment not to burn any product in September 2018 after public backlash over the long-standing practice. But a year and a half later, no other luxury rival has publicly followed the British-based company, underscoring how endemic incineration remains.

However, there are other brands quietly adopting a no-burn policy. Gucci and Moncler — two brands that refrain from participating heavily in the end-of-season sales cycle — do not currently burn unsold stock, although representatives from the company declined to comment on the record about this.

So, what are Burberry and its contemporaries doing to make the shift?

Moving Toward Zero Waste

To rid itself of the £28.6 million ($37.2 million) of product that would have previously been destroyed, Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti has implemented a ""zero-waste mindset"" across the business, from staging carbon-neutral fashion shows to partnering with secondhand luxury marketplace The RealReal to encourage extending the use of clothing. Customers who consign their old Burberry clothing and trenchcoats are offered a personal shopping experience in US stores.

Materials are also being recycled: leather scraps are being donated to leather accessories and homeware maker Elvis & Kresse, which then transforms them into larger components that can be hand-woven into a new hide.

Other initiatives include regenerating rolls of fabric into yarns, other fabrics or insulation for material stuffing in car seats. Burberry is also looking into ways of repurposing unsellable finished products. The business is encouraging extending the life of its products by offering up repair and replacement parts for older leather goods and vintage clothes.

Old Burberry fabric is also donated to Progetto Quid, an Italian brand that employs mostly women from vulnerable groups such as victims of violence and drug trafficking, former inmates and refugees. It’s currently repurposing old Burberry fabrics into new clothing.

At LVMH, the world's largest luxury group, unsold stock is offered to employees via private sales — and certain products are donated to fashion and leather goods schools and charity organisations like La Réserve des Arts and La Fabrique Nomade, which employs refugees and uses materials and textiles from Chaumet, Louis Vuitton and Kenzo.

But while 93 percent of the groups’ 102,184 tonnes of waste was recycled, “transformed into energy” or reused in 2018, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine and Givenchy wouldn’t comment on what happens to the remaining 7 percent. Nor would they comment on the French laws and how they plan to meet them.

Kering, which publishes an annual account of the cost of its business to the planet by tracing and measuring the environmental impact of its supply chain, has committed to be carbon neutral and invests in sustainable materials innovation, as well as recycling and upcycling systems.

The little waste that was incinerated in 2018 and 2019 at Moncler was largely from offcuts and pre-production waste, although unsold product is not burned. Some of it is sold to family and friends of the brand or placed with NGOs to support people in cold, disadvantaged areas, although most of it is placed in the company's own outlets stores.

Using the Outlet Channel Smartly

Of course, Moncler isn’t the only brand to rely on the outlet channel to offload inventory. However, brands must use the channel wisely in order to maintain desirability in the full-price market. Online outlet channels like Yoox make it too convenient and easy to buy luxury at hefty discounts of up to 70 percent, negating the impression of exclusivity, said Bernstein’s Solca. He argued that outlet channels should instead be a place to drop bottle-of-the-barrel items for true bargain hunters only. (For example, irregularly sized items or unpopular styles.) “The unspoken message should be: 'You want the great styles in your size? Go and buy at full price,'"" Solca said.

Outlet channels should ... be a place to drop bottle-of-the-barrel items for true bargain hunters only.

At Kering’s top-performing brand, Gucci, it takes multiple seasons — more than a year — to move product to outlets, with the rest offloaded during friends and family sales. The brand’s merchandising strategy — which is less reliant on one-off seasonal items or concept — means many of its products can stay in full-price stores for longer.

Making Less Product Overall

Reducing the amount of inventory on hand in the first place is also a priority for luxury brands. Burberry is releasing smaller, more frequent collections. Moncler's Genius programme — a series of one-off, limited-edition designer collaborations that drop throughout the year — required an overhaul of its entire supply chain. The precise planning, delivery and accuracy has helped reduce inventory across the board. Moncler's overall full-price sell-through rate is around 70 percent. (Typically, it's about 60 percent for luxury ready-to-wear.)

But producing far, far less product in favour of higher quality, longer-lasting clothes whose life can be extended, recycled or upcycled requires some big shifts in thinking for an industry driven by profit and sales.

LVMH said it has much less unsold stock than mass-market brands, and undertakes “fair production” of high-quality, durable, timeless products that preserve ecosystems.

Embracing a Mindset of Transparency

Overall, brands need to be more transparent about where and why waste is occurring across their supply chains. “It has hit the fashion industry like a thunderstorm, the understanding of just how much they are wasting,” according to Fashion Revolution’s Orsola. “It needs 100 percent transparency and 100 percent slowing down of the industry, which means producing less, producing carefully, and having the understanding of everything you’re producing and a solution in order to maximise its life.”

Editor's note: This story previously stated that Burberry donates unsold clothing to apparel brand Progetto Quid. This is incorrect. Burberry has donated old fabric to the up-cycled label.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholder's documentation guaranteeing BoF's complete editorial independence.

Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH has pledged to use its perfume factories to manufacture hand sanitiser in order to reduce the risk of a shortage in France amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Throughout the ongoing spread of Covid-19, sales of hand sanitiser have notably increased.

Earlier this month, it was reported that supermarket sales of hand sanitiser in the UK had soared by 255 per cent in the four weeks leading up to 23 February.

A few days later, it was reported that hand sanitisers were being flogged on eBay for up to 50 times their retail price.

On Sunday, LVMH released a statement outlining its commitment to making hand sanitisers, stating that from Monday all of the production facilities for its perfume and cosmetics brands would be utilised “to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel”.

The company stated that the gel “will be delivered free of charge to the French health authorities” and as a “priority” to the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, a university hospital trust.

“Given the risk of a shortage of hydroalcoholic gel in France, Bernard Arnault has instructed the LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics business to prepare its production sites to manufacture subtsantial quantities of hydroalcoholic gel to be provided to public authorities,” the statement reads.

“Through this initiative, LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves against the spread of the virus.”

LVMH added that it will “continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary”, while working closely with the health authorities in France.

As of Sunday 15 March, more than 1,370 people in the UK were confirmed to have coronavirus and 35 patients who tested positive have died, the government stated.

More than 40,000 people have been tested across the nation, with more than 38,000 acquiring negative results.

Last week, it was reported that Glossier had closed all its retail stores in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The company’s founder and CEO, Emily Weiss, said that while the firm understands the move will “sacrifice some near-term business goals”, it is “prepared to put public health ahead of our bottom line”.

“We’re not alarmists, we’re realists,” Weiss said at the end of her statement.

“While this may not be the right decision for every company, it’s the one where we feel we can make an impact.”

The World Health Organisation recommends that people clean their hands regularly and thoroughly, washing them for at least 20 seconds with water and soap or hand sanitiser.

If you have any coronavirus symptoms or have recently travelled to an affected area, contact the NHS helpline on 111 and do not visit your GP or hospital."

Louis Vuitton cancelled its spring/summer 2020 repeat show in Bangkok in January while Burberry is adopting a wait-and-see approach to its autumn 2020 Shanghai show on April 23, which was expected to debut exclusive pieces to the China market. Chanel has also put its 31 Rue Cambon 2019/20 Métiers d’Art collection in Beijing, scheduled in May, on hold until a more “appropriate” time.

The outbreak of the coronavirus, known as Covid-19, has brought the world almost to a standstill as countries continue to close borders and airlines cancel flights around the world. As the crisis takes its toll on the global economy, it already has been wreaking havoc on the fashion industry as luxury brands scramble to react.

Major fashion weeks scheduled around Asia have also fallen victim to the outbreak. Shanghai scrapped its plan for Shanghai Fashion Week, followed by the cancellation of China Fashion Week in Beijing. Korea followed suit in cancelling the 2020FW Seoul Fashion Week. On March 2, Japan announced the cancellation of this year’s Tokyo Fashion Week.

At the recent fashion weeks in Paris and Milan, the effects of the virus were also evident as the fashion capitals swapped high fashion for face masks. Chinese fashion designers such as Masha Ma, Shiatzy Chen, Uma Wang, Jarel Zhang, Calvin Luo and Maison Mai skipped Paris Fashion Week this season. A considerable number of Asia-Pacific staff, media, buyers and influencers also stayed away. Giorgio Armani opted for a digital-only streaming of the show with seats empty. A.P.C and Agnès B skipped the autumn/winter 2020 shows.

The US, which is starting to feel the effects of the outbreak now, has not been exempt with Gucci cancelling its Cruise 2021 fashion show in San Francisco. Ralph Lauren, which had opted to show its autumn 2021 collection in April outside January’s New York Fashion Week calendar, has also scratched the event while Versace has postponed its coed cruise autumn 2021 show.

On the international stock exchange markets, while the loss is not entirely attributable to Covid-19, LVMH saw nearly a 20 per cent plunge since the beginning of the year; Kering dropped from €585 (US$662) per share to €449 in three months. The share price of Capri Holdings, parent company of Michael Kors and Versace tanked, sliding 45 per cent to US$20 per share. Prada, listed in Hong Kong, fell close to 30 per cent in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, online marketplaces like Farfetch dropped a modest 2 per cent. (Statistics at time of reporting.)

While Chinese brands have been quick to transition their sales to online platforms such as Taobao and Douyin, luxury insiders see a need for international brands to adapt their retail strategy.

“If your customers cannot go to you then you must show them your world – now more than ever. Reward your loyal Chinese customers – those that support a very large portion of your businesses – by taking them to the outside world through clever vlogging, live-streaming and gamification that lets them feel like an important part of an event that is on the other side of the world,” said Laure de Carayon, CEO of China Connect, a Paris-Shanghai business event platform.

Vanessa Wu, Director Europe of Reuter Communications, a luxury integrated marketing agency based in Shanghai, said she agreed vlogging and live-streaming were the most viable options for international brands.

Chinese consumers, famed for being mobile-first, digital-loving hi-tech natives are familiar with live-streaming across social media platforms. Lanvin live-streamed a virtual-reality show on iQiyi, available in 4K 3D or 8K virtual reality if the follower has the virtual reality headset. “This method allowed their Chinese consumers to still experience fashion week and feel part of the event,” said Wu.

Besides giving consumers access to the new collections, it’s also a key moment to show their understanding and sympathy during this difficult time. A number of international luxury groups including Kering and LVMH have made a donation in combating the outbreak.

Jiaqi Luo, China commentator and essayist, sees this as a vital step in upgrading its communication strategy. “Some brands took the extra mile to show Chinese fans that they care about China's challenging situation through simple, sweet gestures,” Luo explained.

On Weibo, Gucci published a thoughtful drawing from the creative director Alessandro Michele as a sign of solidarity with China during the coronavirus outbreak. Photo: Gucci

For example, on Weibo, Gucci published a thoughtful drawing from the creative director Alessandro Michele as a sign of solidarity. The drawing still shows the Gucci aesthetic, but it also says the message, “I am thinking about you.” Chinese fans especially appreciate this kind of gesture, as it is warm, cute, and authentic, said Luo. “A cancelled show doesn’t mean cancelled dialogue and interactivity,” she adds.

As the coronavirus continues to expand in Europe where the design and headquarters are located for fashion businesses, it’s hard to weigh how significant a loss the fashion industry will face. What contingency plan brands execute will be a decisive element in boosting its immunity for a longer lifespan.

With more than 214,000 confirmed global cases, Donatella Versace, LVMH and Bulgari are among the wave of luxury brands donating generous funds and services to help those in need during these unprecedented times.

Italy has been hit with the largest numbers of COVID-19 cases outside of Asia, recording 475 deaths on 18 March – the highest number of daily deaths to date in the world.

Playing her part, the iconic fashion designer and her daughter Allegra have personally donated a substantial sum to the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy.

“In times like this, it is important to be united and support however we can to help all those who are in the front lines, fighting every day to save hundreds of lives,” Donatella shared online. “This is why Allegra and I have decided to make a personal donation of €200,000 to the intensive care department of San Raffaele hospital in Milan.

“Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this disease and to all the doctors and medical staff who have been working heroically nonstop in the past weeks in the effort to take care of our loved ones.

“This is when we, as a society, need to stand together and care for one another.”

The luxury maison, which owns Louis Vuitton, reportedly gave RMB16 million to the Red Cross Society of China in January during the height of the coronavirus outbreak in the epicentre of Wuhan.

“In addition, through the Red Cross Foundation of China, the Rottweiler Group will also be dedicated to helping to obtain and provide important scarce supplies in France and throughout Europe,” LVMH said in a statement released in January. “Hope to work together to fight and defeat this new type of coronavirus pneumonia.”

Now, as the pandemic weeps the globe prompting drastic shortages in many hygiene products, LVMH recently announced it would convert three of its perfume manufacturing facilities to make hand sanitiser.

Replacing its usual production of Christian Dior and Givenchy fragrances, the company will produce 12 tonnes of sanitising gel, Sky News reported.

The disinfectant gels will be distributed to French public hospitals as the country goes into a 14-day lockdown.

“These gels will be delivered free of charge to the health authorities,” LVMH said in a statement. “LVMH will use the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic brands… to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels from 16 March.

“LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities.”

The CEO and President of Gucci reportedly made a personal donation to eight hospitals in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.

Marco made the donation to AUSL IRCCS to aid the healthcare system as more than 35,713 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in the European nation.

“Our healthcare system, which is fighting against the COVID-19 emergency in these hours with extreme dedication and heroism, deserves the gratitude and support of us all,” Marco said according to WWD. “The countries that faced this emergency before us proved that the work of scientists and healthcare professionals is precious and that the respect of precautions, albeit strict, is fundamental.”

The Italian jewellery company donated an undisclosed figure to the Roman research department in hopes of finding a vaccine for COVID-19.

Istituto Lazzaro Spallanzani was one of the first medical teams to isolate the DNA of the virus where Bulgari’s pledge allowed for researchers to buy a state-of-the-art microscopic image acquisition system.

“Three extraordinary women – Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, Francesca Colavita and Concetta Castilletti – are among the first in Europe that have succeeded in isolating the virus structure,” Bulgari announced.

Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin visited the Research Department of the Lazzara Spallanzani Hospital along with Bulgari Executive Vice President Sales and Retail Lelio Gavazza to deliver the 3D microscope, which is fundamental to finding prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

“We are conscious that the donation is a first small drop in the ocean of research that has to be conducted, but thanks to the wonderful people who are working on it day and night with incredible optimism,” Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin said. “We are sure that in the weeks to come, we will make giant steps to contain first and then eradicate COVID-19, not only from Italy but from the rest of the world.”

Gucci's parent company Kering is among those donating to fight against coronavirus.

The parent company of brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Pomellato and Balenciaga pledged €2 million to support the fight against COVID-19.

“Our thoughts are with the many impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak and, therefore, we have decided to donate the funds as an immediate contribution to assist,” Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault told WWD.

The publication reported that hospitals across Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio are among those benefitting from the generous support.

Earlier in the year, Kering donated US$1.1 million to the Red Cross in China to support those heavily impacted in Hubei.

“The donation will be used for frontline prevention and control work (including care for hospital medical staff and patients) as well as training and public health education,” the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation stated.

The luxury fashion and lifestyle conglomerate will select an eventual winner of its prestigious annual award for young designers on June 5, in a ceremony to be held at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.

The finalists include the menswear labels Ahluwalia by Priya Ahluwalia, Casablanca by Charaf Tajer and Nicholas Daley by Nicholas Daley. Womenswear label Chopova Lowena by Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena also made the cut, as did Peter Do by Peter Do, Sindiso Khumalo by Sindiso Khumalo, Supriya Lele by Supriya Lele, and Tomo Koizumi by Tomotoka Koizumi.

“This year, once more, the semi-ﬁnalists impressed us with their creativity and their commitment to creating clothes that are respectful of the environment,” said Delphine Arnault, Executive Vice President of Louis Vuitton. “I would like to congratulate all of them!”

Out of these eight finalists, there are two designers of Indian origin who have been gracing the British fashion scene with their dynamic work for quite some time now.

Born to a Nigerian father and an Indian mother, Priya Ahluwalia’s exclusive menswear label, Ahluwalia Studio, won her the H&M Design Award in 2019. Ahluwalia’s work creates modern renditions of the 70s style (of her grandfather) and the 90s silhouettes (of her mother). She has also penned a photobook, Sweet Lassi, which traces her experiences in Panipat, India, and Lagos, Nigeria. The two destinations cemented her commitment to ethical fashion, sustainability, and social responsibility via fashion. Her clothing, in a nutshell, is colourfully vintage.

For British-Indian designer Supriya Lele nothing is too Indian. Proud of her heritage, her work synchronises Indian nuances with British style to celebrate a new hybrid in fashion. One can underline a marriage between India’s Maharaja splendour and Britain’s hippie trail. Her work is all about starting a fresh dialogue on these two cultures via feminism, inclusivity, and freedom.

The creatives will compete for a €300,000 (Rs 2.5 crore approx) grant and a one-year mentorship program, while the winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize will receive a €150,000 (Rs 1.2 crore approx) grant and one year of mentorship.

Superstar singer and designer Rihanna, who launched the luxury fashion house of Fenty with LVMH last year, will join the jury of prestigious fashion figures charged with choosing the winner of this year’s prize. Designers Stella McCartney and Virgil Abloh (a former ﬁnalist of the award) have also been snapped up to join the jury, which includes the designers Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs and Clare Waight Keller, among others.

Previous winners of the Prize include the designers Marine Serre, Grace Wales Bonner and Jacquemus."

Bernard Arnault’s Fortune Rose By $11 Billion on Tuesday (The Fashion Law)

Fashion’s richest man saw his fortune increase by more than $11 billion on Tuesday as the stock market rebounded in response to the news that the White House and the Senate had reached an agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus deal. Arnault’s fortune is still down $35.2 billion for the year as a result of the coronavirus crisis. At the same time, it is worth noting that his fortune rose by $40 billion in 2019, the largest individual gain by far of anyone on Bloomberg’s billionaires ranking.

W Magazine Furloughs Staff (Page Six)

According to New York Department of Labor records, Future Media Group, which owns W, has lad off 17 of their 58 employees. According to an insider “the goal is to welcome back employees soon.” W’s digital team is still on staff to keep the magazine’s website running, although they are working at reduced salaries.

Macy’s Shady Attempt to Cash in on Coronavirus Crisis (Diet Prada)

Fashion industry watchdogs Diet Prada, are calling out Macy’s for engaging in dishonest business practices in an attempt to drive online sales during the coronavirus crisis. The retailer’s newly launched “Stay-at-Home Must-Haves” department features hundreds of products Macy’s claims to be offering at deep discounts, but, as Diet Prada points out, many of the “original prices” listed have been massively overblown in an attempt to make it seem like consumers are getting a deal when they’re not. This same sort of “false price referencing” got Macy’s sued in California in 2016 along with other department stores, including JCPenney’s and Kohl’s.

What the $2 Trillion Aid Deal Could Mean for the Fashion Industry (Vogue)

“The aid package creates a $425 billion fund for loans for distressed businesses controlled by the Federal Reserve,” writes Vogue. “Companies that receive loans cannot buy back their stock while they’re receiving assistance and for one year after. Smaller fashion businesses that pledge not to lay off their employees can apply for and receive emergency loans through June 30. If the employer continues to pay employees through the end of the crisis, the loans will be forgiven.”

Retailers Start Suspending Affiliate Programs (Business of Fashion)

Large fashion and beauty retailers including Macy’s, Dillard’s, T.J. Maxx, and Ulta Beauty, are temporarily freezing their affiliate programs during the coronavirus crisis. The move is an attempt by these retailers to keep as much money for themselves as possible at the expense of the influencers who do so much to drive sales. “I know people like to trivialize influencers, but this is people’s livelihoods,” said Marie Denee, who runs the plus-size blog The Curvy Fashionista and received an email from Dillard’s announcing the freeze. “We’ve been growing and scaling our business over the last 11 years, and we’ve weathered quite a lot but this is very traumatic.”

How International Brands Are Celebrating Women's Day - WWD,"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2Rpb3ItbHZtaC1jaGxvZS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXdvbWVucy1kYXktMTIwMzUzMjA4Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Fashion brands and luxury houses are launching a number of initiatives to celebrate International Women’s Day on March 8.

Dior will be unveiling the first in a series of podcasts featuring artists, collaborators and friends of the house. The first “Dior Talks” are devoted to feminist art and will feature Judy Chicago, Tomaso Binga and Mickalene Thomas, who have all collaborated with women’s creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri on her shows.

Other featured guests including British artist Tracey Emin and Paola Ugolini, one of the curators of the upcoming “I Say I” exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rome, sponsored by Dior, which inspired one of Chiuri’s slogan T-shirts for fall 2020.

The exclusive conversations will tackle topics such as the links between ethics and aesthetics, rebellion and dialogue, identity construction and the essential role played by clothing, as well as the representation of gender and its impact on societal behavior.

“These big questions, initially raised by Maria Grazia Chiuri in her manifesto collections, are debated; the entirety of her creative process represents an unwavering support for women artists who disrupt and rewrite our preconceived views of the world,” Dior said in a statement.

The interviews, hosted by journalists, historians and curators including Justine Picardie and Katy Hessel, will be available from March 8 on podcasts.dior.com and numerous podcast platforms.

Dior’s parent company, luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is also branching out into podcasts in order to celebrate International Women’s Day.

Starting today, a series of podcasts named “Tips to the Top” will be released on all major streaming platforms, as well as on the group’s internal radio channel Shero. LVMH chose womanhood as the theme of its first podcasts — which is fitting, since almost three-quarters of the luxury group’s employees are women.

The episodes will focus on 12 female talents, who are either part of LVMH and its maisons or are close collaborators, such as Anastasia Mikova, co-director of documentary “Woman.”

Additionally, the company is supporting “Une Journée Pour Soi,” an initiative in partnership with French charity Secours Populaire, for the second year running.

On March 6, 400 women from underprivileged backgrounds are invited to the Château de Versailles for a day of pampering, including beauty sessions with makeup artists from the LVMH houses and a photo shoot with professional photographers. The initiative will spread to five other cities in France, ending up with a final session at the Louvre Lens on March 31.

“This second edition of ‘Une Journée pour Soi’ is the proof of our continued support of women from impoverished backgrounds,” Antoine Arnault, head of communications and image at LVMH, said in a statement. “We have been able to realize how much this day, which helps rebuild self-confidence, can be a source of energy.”

Over at Chloé, two women have been named ambassadors of “Girls Forward,” a new partnership between the fashion house and UNICEF. Starting March 8, actresses Katie Holmes and Lucy Boynton will appear in videos on Chloé’s social media channels to broadcast the house’s support of UNICEF gender-equality programs, which aim to help 6.5 million adolescent girls and young women around the world advance in the workplace.

The campaign will also feature a capsule collection with all profits going to UNICEF. The collection, which consists of an organic cotton T-shirt in two colorways, as well as a necklace and bracelet, will drop on March 6 in Chloé boutiques in France, the U.K., the U.S., Japan and South Korea, as well as on chloe.com.

Last but not least, Galeries Lafayette has announced its partnership with women’s rights charity Fondation des Femmes, helping create the organization’s “Cité Audacieuse,” the first venue in France dedicated to the promotion of gender equality, which opened on March 5.

In addition to funding the project — which will serve as a business incubator and research space, and will be fully open to the general public — 50 Galeries Lafayette employees helped complete construction work on the building.

“This partnership is another concrete illustration of our convictions and desire to provide women with the most equitable and respectful work and personal environment possible,” Frédérique Chemaly, director of human resources and sustainable development at the Galeries Lafayette and BHV Marais, said in a statement.

To celebrate the opening of Cité Audacieuse, the department store has teamed with French brands Rive Droite and Patine to design a clutch bag and a T-shirt. All the profits from sales will be donated to the Fondation des Femmes."
"Prada, LVMH, Gucci, and Pyer Moss among luxury fashion names contributing to Covid-19 relief | Life - News24","Mon, 23 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL2xpZmUvYXJjaGl2ZS9wcmFkYS1sdm1oLWd1Y2NpLWFuZC1weWVyLW1vc3MtYW1vbmctbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb24tbmFtZXMtcmFsbHlpbmctdG8tYWlkLWNvdmlkLTE5LXJlbGllZi0yMDIwMDMyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Well, the fashion industry has gone out of its way to rebrand, continuously attempting to create an image that is ethical, conscious, and politically correct. At times, the major players of this multi-billion dollar industry get it wrong, but it would appear that in more recent events, they’re seated on the right side of history’s front row.

We previously reported on how the coronavirus pandemic threatened not only fashion week shows across the fashion capital cities, but had affected production too. As a result, the luxury goods market has taken a slight hit economically as many have been forced to shut their doors in order to curtail the contagion – especially given the fact that China and Italy - as the countries most affected by Covid-19 - are just two of the biggest hubs of activity for textiles and fashion respectively.

But not to be forgotten are the small and independent businesses who are experiencing an inevitable threat to their profits too.

Pyer Moss founder and Haitian-American fashion designer Kerby Jean-Raymond, is an influential figure in this industry, who has taken it upon himself to ensure that these small businesses (and their owners) do not fall to their demise in the wake of the global Covid-19 spread. Kerby took to Instagram last week to pledge $50 000 (over R880 000) for minority and women owned small creative businesses, making a call to action to those in distress to reach out to what one can assume is a newly founded initiative called Your Friends in New York.

Another act of goodwill that forms of part of the Pyer Moss initiative has been extended to the medical community. Their (Pyer Moss) New York City office has been converted into a donation center for N95 masks and latex gloves. Kerby’s team will also set aside $5 000 (approximately R88 200) to purchase these essential supplies.



Kerby Jean-Raymond’s European fashion counterparts are also doing their bit to alleviate any further calamity the pandemic may cause.

Below, we give you in brief how luxury Italian and French companies are making contributions to aid relief:

D&G

Dolce & Gabbana announced that it has partnered with Humanitas University to fund a coronavirus research project.

Armani

Giorgio Armani, which streamed their show during Milan Fashion Week after the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the city, has donated $1.43 million dollars to four hospitals in Rome and Milan, as well as to the Civil Protection Agency.

Prada

Following the news that the coronavirus death toll in Italy had increased by nearly 400 in 24 hours, rising from 1441 to 1809, Prada co-CEOs Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada, and chairman Carlo Mazzi personally donated six intensive care and resuscitation units to three hospitals in Milan - San Raffaele, Sacco and Vittore Buzzi (a children's hospital).

LVMH

LVMH, alongside other cosmetics groups including L'Oreal, is using some of its perfume factories to make hand sanitiser. LVMH, the parent company of Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy, wants to help French health authorities by manufacturing hand sanitiser in its perfume factories, and providing it to them for free. “LVMH said it will use all the production facilities of its perfumes and cosmetics brands to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel, or hand sanitiser”, a Reuters report said.

Kering

Meanwhile, ‘rival’ to LVMH, French luxury group Kering which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta has a made a 2 million euro (over R38 million) donation to help fight against the coronavirus. Additionally the Paris-based company will give the French health service 3 million surgical masks which it plans to import from a Chinse supplier, and Gucci will produce and donate 1.1 million masks and 55 000 medical overalls to Italy.

Versace

Donatella Versace and her daughter, Allegra Versace Beck, have donated €200 000 (over R3 million) to the intensive care unit of Milan’s San Raffaele hospital.

Bulgari

According to Vogue, early last month, Bulgari contributed to the research department at the Istituto Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome, which was working to purchase a microscopic image acquisition system to help fight and prevent the spread of Covid-19.

LVMH Group brands invite consumers to 'travel abroad' on social media - Inside Retail Asia,"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAyMC8wMy8zMS9sdm1oLWdyb3VwLWJyYW5kcy1pbnZpdGUtY29uc3VtZXJzLXRvLXRyYXZlbC1hYnJvYWQtb24tc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Group brands are using social-media campaigns to allow consumers to “escape differently” with branded content inspired by “nomadic thinking” during the coronavirus crisis.

Multiple brands within the LVMH stable are embracing the concept which is in response to the global imperative for people to stay home in the midst of the pandemic.

“With physical travel limited to a strict minimum and billions of people around the world asked to remain at home, the desire for distant horizons has rarely been felt so strongly,” the company explains. “People confined to their home must battle boredom as they ponder the closed doors in front of them…”

One of the LVMH Group brands involved in the project is luxury luggage label Rimowa whose Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa who transformed its iconic aluminum suitcase into a chair, “an invitation to rest, reflect and dream of a radiant future”.

Another example was the firm’s beauty brand Benefit Cosmetics, which invited followers to join a “globe-spinning” contest to win a year of cosmetics supplies.

Clos19, the Moet Hennessy e-commerce platform, is publishing content that offers followers a chance to broaden their knowledge of vineyards and grape varieties.

Part of the LVMH Group brands campaign dips into the pages of its history to share photos shot by French photographer Jean Lariviere in the 1980s for several emblematic advertisements.

In a separate response to the pandemic, LVMH has moved to provide several million surgical masks in France to help those affected by Covid-19.

"At Bulgari, Infusing Global Innovation with Local Heritage - The Business of Fashion","Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd29ya3BsYWNlLXRhbGVudC9idWxnYXJpLWNlby1pbnRlcnZpZXctamVhbi1jaHJpc3RvcGhlLWJhYmluLWdsb2JhbC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWxvY2FsLWhlcml0YWdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROME, Italy — Founded in 1884 by Sotirio Bulgari as a single jewellery shop in Rome, Bulgari is today a global LVMH maison renowned for its artisanal craft and Roman heritage. Over the brand's 136-year history, Bulgari has expanded its core product offering across five key verticals: jewellery, watches, handbags and accessories, fragrances and luxury hotels and resorts in Milan, London, Dubai, Bali, Beijing and Shanghai, with plans to expand to Paris, Moscow and Tokyo over the next three years.

The LVMH Group acquired the brand in 2011 for €3.7 billion — one of their largest acquisitions of the last decade. The six brands that make up LVMH’s jewellery and watch offering accumulatively brought in €4.4 billion of sales in 2019.

Perhaps surprisingly, given its size, traditional Italian craftsmanship still sits at the heart of the business. Bulgari opened a new manufacturing facility in Valenza in 2017, designed to nurture the Made in Italy jewellery savoir faire of the northern region alongside its Bulgari Academy — an existing internal training programme, transferring expertise from experienced goldsmiths to the next generation of young talent. By 2022, the brand plans to double the size of its Valenza-based manifattura, which would make it the largest jewellery manufacturing centre in the world and create 700 new roles in the process.

BoF sits down with Jean-Christophe Babin, the group’s chief executive, to hear how Bulgari’s pedigree of authentic craftsmanship has been infused by a culture of agility and ambition as well.

How would you describe the company culture at Bulgari?

For us, it's really important that we are the flagship of Italian excellence when it comes to luxury experiences. Authenticity, craftsmanship, quality and an original pedigree of everything we create is part of our culture. Our jewellery is 100 percent Made in Italy; our fragrances and leather goods are Italian and then our watches are 100 percent Swiss-made.

But importantly, we have embedded a never-give-up mentality in our culture, which I believe is typically Italian. This year, for example, we have had to react to the COVID-19 threat, which has led to many cancellations of industry events. We cancelled the Geneva Watch Fair in February, for example, but we were still able to organise the first LVMH Watch Week in Dubai. It proved we are agile, entrepreneurial and extremely adaptive to the environment.

I'm also obsessed with raising the level of ambition of my team and then providing them with the empowerment, resources and trust to develop, take more risks and raise their voice. Trying is always rewarded and failing is never punished — it's a culture of fostering, trying and learning. This has taken a bit of time within the company because people need to trust you before they unleash their energy and creativity, but my challenge today is not to stimulate new ideas but rather to prioritise and channel so many ideas.

How is Bulgari reacting to the demands of today’s luxury consumer?

We have consumers from all generations but, if we focus on Millennials as the primary [luxury consumer] group, they want authenticity, which feeds into the Made in Italy culture, and they have a higher ethical drive. They need to know how a piece has been crafted, how the company operates and how the company is sourcing its ingredients or raw materials.

I think we are a very responsible company and we have tried to be active when it comes to sustainability, from developing our own jasmine fields in India, to be respectful of local agriculture, to the plastic-free policy we have in our 5-star hotels. We are also one of the largest contributors to the Save the Children foundation, with our company donating around €100 million over 10 years.

Trying is always rewarded and failing is never punished — it's a culture of fostering, trying and learning.

Millennial consumers also need a sense of inclusivity — they want to feel like a part of a community that is respected by the brand. That's why we are so present on social media. When [Sotirio] Bulgari first operated in Rome over 100 years ago, he knew each and every client, their daughters, sons, parents. Thanks to the digital world today, we are able to recreate those one-to-one relationships and re-establish a personal connection. Eventually, we believe memories from an experience will be regarded the ultimate benefit that clients will look for.

What growth opportunities is Bulgari focused on today?

Jewellery remains, and will forever be, the core business and signature of Bulgari. We were born a jeweller and we will grow primarily as a jeweller. Jewellery has always celebrated turning points in life, so we are looking to further enhance that within the experiential dimensions of the brand, not only when buying jewellery in our store but in our hotels too. Today, it is not only about craftsmanship and art, but emotion and experience.

Despite being a jeweller, we created the first-ever high-end boutique hotel chain 16 years ago, further demonstrating Bulgari’s obsession with hospitality, which we have always tried to preserve in our boutiques and one-to-one relationships with our clients. We want to be an exclusive, small community with most guests as returning clients. We have six existing hotels, three more about to open and we will announce three new projects this year. The strategy behind the hotel sees it as the pinnacle of the Bulgari experience, from the spa to the valet to the restaurant and room service. They are designed to allow our clients to dive deep into our brand.

However, the hotels are not just serving a superior experience but also bringing in the brand clients likely to buy our jewellery. That's why all the five business areas are complementary, from perfumes recruiting younger consumers from 15 years old, to jewellery or watches being your first real luxury purchase, to eventually buy into the high jewellery and hotel stays, which are the pinnacle of the experience.

What role does the Bulgari Academy play in the business?

The Bulgari Academy is important for two reasons. Jewelley is an art and [I believe] this art is not really taught in the schooling system in Italy or France anymore. We are running the risk that in two generations, no one will be able to set a jewel in Italy. It's our mission to ensure we have a school that will consolidate our expertise generation after generation.

It's our mission to ensure we have a school that will consolidate our expertise generation after generation.

The second point is that we are growing very fast. We opened a new manufacturing site in Valenza three years ago and we're about to start the construction of an extension, which will double its capacity by 2022. Bulgari is already the largest jewellery manufacturer in Europe, and once we complete the second phase of the project by 2022, the manufacturing space will probably be the largest in the world. So, we believe we will need to create an additional 700 jobs in the next five years and they have to be filled by people coming from outside the jewellery industry because, in most cases, those from within the industry will already be working indirectly with Bulgari in smaller family-owned contractors.

We know it is a daunting challenge, hiring for 700 new skilled jobs for 2025, and that's why we are strongly investing in the Academy. We need it as nothing will ever replace the mani intelligenti. There are a lot of things that no machine will ever do. Once we have fulfilled all the requirements from [the growth we expect at] Bulgari, we will probably open it to our partners, our suppliers and the family-run companies that often work with Bulgari. We have no secrets and we can benefit from educating others that work directly with us.

What characteristics stand Bulgari employees apart?

Including the hotels, we have about 7,000 employees, so that means 7,000 different characters and 7,000 different histories, so it's a bit difficult to aggregate one archetype of the Bulgari employee. However, what strikes me most, from the Beijing hotel to the Valenza manufacturer, to American security or a salesperson in the Dubai flagship store, is their passion. I believe everyone in the company is proud to be Roman, whether you're Japanese, American or South African — they are proud to participate as an ambassador of Italian excellence through Bulgari.

LVMH group will instead concentrate the production of some of its companies on hand sanitiser gel to be donated to French hospitals.

Kering donates 2 million to hospitals

Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Brioni, Pomellato and Alexander McQueen have donated 2 million euros together. The money will be donated to healthcare facilities in the four Italian regions where the brands are most present. Namely Veneto, Lombardy, Tuscany and Lazio.

Hand gel from LVMH

“Faced with the risk of gel deficiency observed in France, Bernard Arnault asked LVMH’s perfume and cosmetic branches to take action to produce and offer hydro-alcoholic gel to the authorities”. The French luxury group has thus announced the conversion of part of its production. Ready to answer the CEO’s call are Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy. In the first week alone, 12 tons of gel should be produced. The product will primarily go to 39 French public hospitals.

Where workers used to oversee the creation of Christian Dior, Givenchy and Guerlain perfumes, hydro alcoholic gel is now transferred into plaster containers elegantly topped with the Dior logo. LVMH is expecting to produce 12 tonnes of the hydro alcoholic gel in its first week of production, to be delivered free of charge to French health authorities starting this week.

At the behest of Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, the luxury conglomerate is responding to a shortage of hand sanitiser in its native France, where many pharmacies are restricting clients to one small bottle each.

“The cosmetics factories are very similar to pharmaceutical factories,” explains Marc-Antoine Jamet, general secretary of LVMH. ""Sometimes they have the same [ingredients]; that’s why we have diverted our production lines into this gel production. We were told that perhaps hand sanitisers will be at risk of shortage in Paris hospitals and elsewhere.”

After extensive consultations with the relevant authorities, LVMH worked with specialist laboratories and pharmacists to develop an appropriate formula “to ensure that our product was anti-virus and anti-bacterial, for the safety of public health,” Jamet explains.

LVMH has ordered its parfums facilities to produce hand sanitisers in order to combat the coronavirus, a move which has not been seen since WW2 when watchmakers made arms. Who was the influence? Pioneering Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie

Mar 17, 2020 | By Jonathan Ho

In every continent, today’s philanthropists acknowledge the enduring influence of Andrew Carnegie. But on Sunday 15th March 2020, LVMH Moët Hennessy took Carnegie’s Gospel of Wealth philosophy to the next level. The Louis Vuitton owner ordered that its perfume and cosmetics facilities be re-tooled to manufacture hydroalcoholic gel or hand sanitisers.

Lauren Sherman, Executive Editor of Business of Fashion reported that the directive came straight from LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault, though it was not confirmed, yesterday, Monday the 16th saw LVMH facilities that produce fragrances and cosmetics for Christian Dior, Guerlain, and Givenchy switching over to hand sanitisers and hand disinfectant gel, which will be given to French health authorities and hospitals free of charge.

“LVMH will use the production lines of its perfume and cosmetic brands…to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels from Monday. These gels will be delivered free of charge to the health authorities. LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities.” LVMH statement

From Perfume to Hand Sanitiser, LVMH’s Act of Philanthropy not Seen Since World War II

During World War II, America’s manufacturing might was key to the Allied victory. By the beginning of 1944, the output of American factories was twice that of all the Axis nations as manufacturers, including watchmakers like Hamilton, Bulova and Waltham, shut down normal operations and retooled for wartime; in essence, LVMH’s act of philanthropy in switching from cosmetics to hand sanitiser has not been seen in over 70 years and their’s is an act (especially if this influences other industries to join them – creating medical diagnostic tools, masks and other vital medical supplies) that would appear to be the key in our own allied victory against the coronavirus.

Gospel of Wealth – A classic model for modern corporate social responsibility

Having made his fortune in Pittsburgh America, Carnegie is indisputably the world’s greatest ever philanthropist. If you’ve heard of the Carnegie name, its likely you’ve discovered it from the many libraries, universities and scholarships awarded to the poor and disenfranchised. In addition to feeding the mind, Carnegie believed in feeding the soul, creating spaces for appreciating music and culture, like the famed namesake Carnegie Hall in New York. By the time he died in 1919, Carnegie had already given away more than 90% of his fortune $350 billion (adjusted for 2020 inflation) wealth accumulated as the world’s biggest steel maker. No one comes near to him for the scale of giving much more than today’s biggest donors Bill and Melinda Gates.

What makes him so influential is how most of our modern conglomerates and conglomerate owners behave today mirrors his ideals: Carnegie wasn’t the just the world’s biggest philanthropist, he was the world’s most modern philanthropist. His treatise, the Gospel of Wealth has set down the principles for giving that many of today’s ultra-wealthy are measured against when it comes to giving back to society.

If the portrait of a billionaire philanthropist seems familiar today, it is directly as a result of Andrew Carnegie’s pioneering giving; in his day, it was revolutionary. In case you have not yet noticed, most philanthropic efforts today, either from on an individual or corporate scale, is modelled on Carnegie’s ideals chronicled in his Gospel of Wealth: financial donations are put to nourishing society’s most disadvantaged in a holistic manner – mind, body and soul.

Carnegie’s philanthropic vision was extraordinarily futurist: he gave millions to promote peace and disarmament but his greatest idea was one where he thought that if all the great industrialists (the high net worth individualists of his time) of the world came together, World Wars could be prevented. Indeed, given the globalised nature of our interconnected economies, an active war with multiple nations on the scale of World War II is not as likely today but nevertheless, we still deal with existential threats to global peace in the form of international trade and economic warfare and third party “actors” in the case of the Covid-19 coronavirus which has now turned into a global pandemic.

“I know you would, rather than instead of building this, I had distributed it to you in the form of higher wages. That’s what you think would have been proper? But if I had given you more money in your pay cheques, what would you have done with it? You might have bought a better cut of meat for the family. You might have spent it on drink. But I know what you need: You need a library. You need a museum, you need a concert hall. These is what raises the working man. And that’s why I saved this money. And I’m now giving back to the community what the community needs.” – Andrew Carnegie on the opening of his library in Pittsburgh

Dealing with the “contradictions” of modern philanthropy

When the Notre Dame de Paris caught fire back in April 2019, the outpouring of global grief and the pledging of vast sums of money towards its re-build and restoration prompted an equivalent push back of social justice warriors wondering if the money could have been better spent “feeding the poor” or “housing the homeless”. This “contradiction” as been a 200 year old problem which Carnegie himself dealt with during the peak of the 19th century. In his usual brusque manner, he told a crowd of employees during the opening of his namesake library in Pittsburgh, “I know you would, rather than instead of building this, I had distributed it to you in the form of higher wages. That’s what you think would have been proper? But if I had given you more money in your pay cheques, what would you have done with it? You might have bought a better cut of meat for the family. You might have spent it on drink. But I know what you need: You need a library. You need a museum, you need a concert hall. These is what raises the working man. And that’s why I saved this money. And I’m now giving back to the community what the community needs.”

While his condescension might not have been well received, his vexatious annoyance with small mindedness is really aimed towards a psychological issue in how most human beings process information. Case in point, Philippe Martinez, leader of the General Confederation of Labor trade union once stated, “If they can give tens of millions to rebuild Notre Dame, then they should stop telling us there is no money to help with the social emergency.”

It might be tempting to think you have to align yourself on the side of social justice warriors or billionaire foundations but philanthropic conundrums of this nature are a false dichotomy. Intellectually and philosophically speaking, there’s nothing wrong with donating to the restoration of a burned cathedral or contributing to the arts because humanity is not the sum of its basic needs and biological impulses. We need food for the body, just as we need sustenance for the mind and soul. We have urgent problems like homelessness, unequal food distribution and wealth inequality but we also have pressing concerns that deal with “preserving cultural identity” and our artistic heritage – philanthropy simply isn’t a zero-sum in the way we think.

The Gospel according to Andrew (Carnegie)

Even if not outright influenced by Carnegie’s Gospel of Wealth, many today mimic his pattern of giving and thinking. That said, Carnegie’s philanthropy eventually drove him to ever greater ruthlessness as a businessman. In his pursuit for “returning to society”, the former friend of the unions began dismantling the very institutions he had supported on the side of the working class he championed. Why? So his steel company could be more competitive and that he could make more money to give away.

Though he came to the realisation in the latter part of his life, his efforts in undoing the damage he had done were not sufficient and he took it upon himself to address what he saw as the fundamental challenges facing society in his time, a problem which very much exists till this day: the proper administration of wealth.

In the modern age where wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, Carnegie’s gospel is just as relevant today as it was close to 200 years ago: In 1889, men like J. P. Morgan , John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt and William Randolph Hearst, also known as “robber barons” were generating enormous fortunes and Carnegie had written his gospel to justify this concentration of wealth and to show how it could then be redistributed.

He held that the first duty of the man of wealth, was to set an example of modest living, shunning display or extravagance, to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him, and after doing so, to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, for which he is called upon to administer and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which in his judgment is best calculated, to produce the most beneficial results to the community: Is it any wonder that the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, established in 1945, which owns Rolex, donates a great deal of its income to charity and social causes in Geneva and around the world?

To Carnegie, wealth was a moral and ethical responsibility and his gospel did not make him a popular man: because nobody, least of all the rich and powerful, want to be told that what they’re doing is immoral or lacking in ethical standing. Yet, in his perspective, men of wealth, economically the fittest of the modern civilisation do indeed have a duty to do the smart thing with the immense resources they can marshal towards the common good. Carnegie’s instruction to his contemporaries was truly radical and even today, relevant.

“He who dies rich, dies disgraced.” – Carnegie

LVMH and the marshalling of industrial resources

What LVMH has done with the production of hand sanitisers using their cosmetics facilities is exemplary. Especially so if its truly on the directive of French billionaire business magnate Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault. He was instrumental in establishing LVMH as a major patron of art in France when he established a cornerstone of the company in 1991 with corporate philanthropy initiatives that serve the general interest. More recently in 2019, Arnault pledged $200 million to the rebuilding of Notre Dame de Paris and $11 million to help fight the wildfires ravaging the Amazon rainforest; LVMH has also pledged $2.2 million to Chinese Red Cross in Wuhan to help with medical supplies but his latest move on marshalling industrial production resources from his facilities is inarguably wise on ethical, moral and economic grounds.

“(It) is not just about words and speeches or signing declarations of principle, it also requires taking concrete collective actions when dangers arise in order to provide resources for local specialists and work together to save our planet.” – Yann Arthus-Bertrand, LVMH Advisory Board Member

Retail is at a standstill, a growing number of cities are on lockdown, and rather than let factories (and employees) run fallow, LVMH has decided to put its massive capability and know-how at producing maximum public good – in this case, literal disinfectant gel that will be delivered to French health authorities and the Assistance Publique-Hospitaux de Paris, a network of 39 teaching hospitals that treats more than eight million patients each year.

Meanwhile, France has closed eateries and other non-essential stores in an effort to combat the virus which has infected more than 156,000 people worldwide and killed at least 5,833. It is modern warfare the likes we have never seen. A truly globalised world and its interconnected economies mean that more than ever, the wealth and resources concentrated the hands of the few can be utilised to maximum effectiveness.

At press time: Chinese Billionaire Jack Ma has donated a total of 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million masks, and 60,000 protective suits and face shields in the African continent. His first shipment of 1 million masks and 500,000 coronavirus test kits arrived in the United States on Monday morning, yesterday.

After more than four decades of leading the most influential tech company in the world, Bill Gates has withdrawn from Microsoft to focus on philanthropic activities with special attention on “global health and development, education, and increasing engagement in tackling climate change.” The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was launched in 2000 and is reported to be the largest private foundation in the world, holding $46.8 billion in assets. Meanwhile, Amazon and Gates Foundation are in discussion to deliver coronavirus test kits to Seattle homes. Further proving that the needs of the world have evolved beyond mere financial aid but in the leveraging of production and logistics capability as demonstrated by the likes of LVMH. The Group projects that it will make 12 tons of hand sanitiser within its first week and it will continue to do so free of charge as long as France requires."
Ken Griffin's fund Citadel rumored in shocking drop in Tiffany shares - New York Post,"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzAzLzIwL2tlbi1ncmlmZmlucy1mdW5kLWNpdGFkZWwtZHJvdmUtc2hvY2tpbmctZHJvcC1pbi10aWZmYW55LXNoYXJlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A deep and surprising drop in Tiffany shares this week came amid chatter that it was sparked by a trader’s recent departure at billionaire Ken Griffin’s hedge fund Citadel Investments, sources told The Post.

After recently losing a trader at one of its merger arbitrage desks, Citadel’s Surveyor Capital fund liquidated a position in the New York-based jeweler, which agreed in November to be acquired for $16.2 billion by French luxury giant LVMH, according to sources close to the fund.

Last week, Tiffany shares briefly dipped below $110 — a 19-percent discount to its acquisition price of $135 a share. The steep selloff had fueled speculation that the LVMH-Tiffany deal might be in trouble amid the coronavirus crisis.

Indeed, LVMH was forced to issue a statement last week saying it was interested in buying Tiffany shares on the open market before its deal closed. In response, Tiffany shares recovered to close at $125.44 on Friday.

Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Citadel’s Surveyor Fund had recently lost a portfolio manager its merger arbitrage desk, Maulin Shah, insiders said. Sources said rumors were rampant that Citadel had been liquidating its Tiffany position because of Shah’s departure, possibly helping spark the recent, precipitous drop in the jeweler’s shares.

A source close to the situation, however, told The Post that Citadel had sold the Tiffany shares managed by Shah ahead of this week’s sharp drop, and that the position wasn’t big enough to cause such a sharp decline.

Tiffany’s stock drop “occurred while the broader stock market plummeted, and it is not surprising given the current market and social/travel restrictions that a seller of luxury jewelry items would see such a drop,” the source added.

A Citadel spokeswoman declined to comment on Shah’s departure. Shah couldn’t be reached for comment, but arbitrage traders say it’s standard practice for a fund to liquidate positions left by a departing trader who was most knowledgeable about the thinking behind them.

“When the head is gone the trades need to be gone too,” one such trader told The Post. “You don’t want their positions.”

The speculation comes as hedge funds eye their merger arbitrage desks — which take major positions in the stocks of merging companies, profiting from relatively small upticks when the deals are completed — as cash piles ripe for harvesting in case of a liquidity crunch, sources said.

With the coronavirus crushing stocks, hedge funds are eager to keep a healthy balance sheet to protect against redemptions and margin calls, sources said. Indeed, insiders say the crisis is beginning to reveal how many funds have piled into what industry insiders call “risk parity,” a strategy that seeks to lower risk through diversification while also pumping returns through leverage, or borrowed money.

This strategy has become a financial minefield as virtually every asset class has imploded and the credit market has seized up, forcing many hedge funds to make a mad dash for cash, experts say.

“The market action surrounding risk parity funds clearly shows that these guys were jammed into basically the same trades which have been unwound not by the portfolio managers that built these trades, but by the firms’ risk managers,” said Thomas Thornton of Hedge Fund Telemetry. “A lot of chatter out there that these portfolio managers have been shut down.”

It’s not just Tiffany shares that got hammered last week. Tech Data — an electronics distributor that was sold in November for $145 a share to buyout firm Apollo Global Management — saw its shares plunge below $100 last week. On Friday, they closed at $114.

[This story has been updated to reflect that a recent drop in Tiffany’s shares came amid rumors that it was sparked by the departure of a Citadel trader. An earlier version of this story had stated that the drop was partly driven by the trader’s departure. Also, Maulin Shah was a portfolio manager, not the head of a merger arbitrage desk at Citadel, and he did not make a bad bet on the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, according to a source close to the situation.]"
LVMH orders 40 million masks from China for France - The Business Standard,"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXkvbHZtaC1vcmRlcnMtNDAtbWlsbGlvbi1tYXNrcy1jaGluYS1mcmFuY2UtNTkyOTPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy50YnNuZXdzLm5ldC9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2dsb2JhbC1lY29ub215L2x2bWgtb3JkZXJzLTQwLW1pbGxpb24tbWFza3MtY2hpbmEtZnJhbmNlLTU5MjkzP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, is ordering 40 million health masks from a Chinese supplier to help France cope with the coronavirus outbreak.

The first order, for a total of 10 million masks, will be delivered in coming days, LVMH said in a statement on Saturday. This initial batch will be given to the French health service for distribution to those in need early next week.

The rest of the order, on which LVMH cooperated with the French government, will be funded by the state and should be delivered in coming weeks.

LVMH, owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and controlled by France's richest man Bernard Arnault, is already producing and delivering free-of-charge hand sanitizer to French hospitals.

""In order to secure this (mask) order during an extremely tense period and to ensure that the production begins today, Bernard Arnault arranged for LVMH to finance the whole of the first week of deliveries, amounting to 5 million euros ($5.4 million),"" the group said.

Countries around the world are struggling to deal with the biggest public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic, with medical supplies and protective gear in short supply.

Many health professionals in France have criticized the shortages as the country fights coronavirus and entered a unprecedented lockdown on Tuesday."
From leather to LVMH: our interview with Fabrizio Masoni - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - laconceria.it,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vdGFubmVyeS9mcm9tLWxlYXRoZXItdG8tbHZtaC1vdXItaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXdpdGgtZmFicml6aW8tbWFzb25pL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We interviewed (as mentioned in the first lines of the text) Fabrizio Masoni, owner of Masoni Industria Conciaria, on February 19, 2020.

The day we meet Fabrizio Masoni and his wife Federica is the first of the last edition of Lineapelle. We are in Fieramilano Rho, it is February 19 of a year, 2020, which began with great hopes and, unfortunately, is about to sink into the drift of the Covid-19 emergency. What is perceived upon entering the booth of their tannery, is exactly what, shortly after, emerges from their words. Few frills, clear ideas, a real pride.

Brief summary of the company

Founded in 2001, Masoni Industria Conciaria, achieved a turnover of 47 million euros last year. A result that stems from a path of “continuous growth – explains Fabrizio Masoni – both in production and in turnover, despite a small slowdown last year”. A result that, together with a whole host of other reasons, led the Santa Croce sull’Arno tannery to sign a particularly significant agreement. Signed, thus entering the capital of Masoni as a minority shareholder, by French giant LVMH, historical customer of the Tuscan tannery. Our interview inevitably starts here.

How was this operation born and in what direction?

“I am proud that LVMH asked me to enter our capital. Proud that the company and our management are appreciated. And I am proud of the growth project that we drew together. We will make investments, which we have undertaken independently, for example by starting a new finishing in Castelfranco di Sotto in September, which allows us to increase production by 30-40%, going up to 65 employees. It was highly appreciated by the LVMH group that we made this choice regardless of their entry into the capital”.

How does the business management model change now?

“It does not change. The autonomy of business management remains the same. Our leathers will be sold to anyone who will give us the opportunity to use them in its collections. There is no forcing by LVMH brands, which represent around 20% of our turnover, to have special supplies in terms of price and quality. Of course, we have room to work harder, while maintaining all our historical customers”.

Does the Masoni-LVMH “project” also concern sustainability?

“Sure. I am absolutely convinced, however, that “sustainability” does not exist. I firmly believe that every company must find its dimension in this sense”.

What is yours?

“With LVMH, we are developing a very important project, regardless of the type of tanning, with and without chromium. But it is much wider than that. It concerns enhancing the purchase of suitable products, the use of clean energy, a water recycling system. Many small tricks, which go as far as the recent endowment for the company of an electric car fleet. A bit like when we went to school, as children, and they taught us that many small gestures, if we all do them, become huge gestures”.

A gesture of yours these days concerns the Coronavirus emergency: can you explain it to us?

“This situation impacts us now and will impact us in the future. If only for the fact that we sell leather to those who, in turn, sell accessories in Asia and China. All these customers sent the input to their production sites to slow down their stocks, rumours say around 30%. And this input has come down to us. So we decided to close on Friday. We work a little less, but we all work. As tanneries of present days, we need to work with a horizon that is no more than 6 months: at most it reaches 2 months. This emergency depends on how long it lasts. So, for now I have not limited the purchase of raw materials, but I have temporarily reduced the dyeing and the final stages”.

What does it mean to be a tanner today?

“We have always needed a particular passion in tannery. Every new leather you produce is a creature, and the greatest satisfaction is when, as happened here at Lineapelle, a customer you respect and who has experience and universal knowledge of the material, tells you: “This leather is wonderful”. The passion is needed in all jobs, but I know this particular one, and one of the reasons why I was very happy to start the synergy with LVMH lies in the fact that I love this job and I hope to pass on this way of being”.

How will tanneries change in the near future?

“In a 10 years time tanneries will be a completely different thing. And they will be much less in terms of their number. They will be completely traceable, managed by “doctors”, but the “real” ones will still make “the leather of great-grandparents”. That is: the winning tanneries will be those that will focus on quality, because there is never an end to low prices. Over the years, I have seen some of my competitors approaching customers with very low prices: in the end they hurt themselves. Because quality wins, and focusing on it, having to guarantee various and high standards of compliance, requires a cost and a company that does things well, as it should be. For us, the entry of a partner like LVMH represents in this sense a great responsibility, but also a great opportunity to invest in excellence”."

The company, which has its headquarters based in Paris, released a statement about the production of personal sanitiser, confirming it would continue production for “as long as necessary.” Forbes reports that in its first week of production, the pivoted cosmetics lines are hoping to produce up to 12 tonnes of the stuff.

“Through this initiative, LVMH intends to help address the risk of a lack of product in France and enable a greater number of people to continue to take the right action to protect themselves from the spread of the virus,” the statement read.

“LVMH will continue to honour this commitment for as long as necessary, in connection with the French health authorities.”

Though this is all very nice and well and good from the luxe beauty and fashion brand, I do wonder how this stuff is going to be packaged. Are we gonna see some little bottles of hand sani printed with the iconic Louis Vuitton or Dior logos? Please, let that happen.
