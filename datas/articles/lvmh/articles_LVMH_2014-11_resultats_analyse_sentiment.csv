After a regulatory filing late last month, in which LVMH outlined how it will rid itself of its 23% holding in the Birkin bag company (which it acquired in violation of French stock market rules), the luxury conglomerate has released a statement, entitled “Exceptional distribution in kind of shares of Hermès International,” which states that the LVMH board is set to approve the relinquishment plan at its Combined General Meeting on November 25 and that the proposed relinquishment will occur on December 17. LVMH states that the divestment comes on the heels of “a settlement agreement aimed at restoring a climate of positive relations between them.”

Pursuant to this settlement, LVMH will rid itself of the majority of its Hermès shares, and both the conglomerate and chairman Bernard Arnault personally will not to acquire any Hermès shares during a five-year period from the date of distributing the shares it currently holds.

According to the statement, “In the event that the LVMH General Shareholders’ Meeting approves this distribution, Financière Jean Goujon and Christian Dior shall distribute the Hermès shares that they receive to their respective shareholders.” Moroever, LVMH states: “Following the completion of these transactions, LVMH, Financière Jean Goujon and Christian Dior will no longer hold any Hermès shares with the exception of Hermès shares representing rights to fractional interests or non-distributed shares due to the distribution ratio. These shares will be sold no later than September 3, 2015.”

Christian Dior, which currently holds 40.9% of LVMH’s share capital through its wholly-owned subsidiary Financière Jean Goujon, issued a similar statement to its shareholders, as well. Dior has also agreed to distribute the Hermès shares that it will receive from LVMH (indirectly through Financière Jean Goujon) to its own shareholders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999771118164062}",neutral,0.9999771118164062,0

Carte Blanc - Robb Report,"Sat, 01 Nov 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy9jYXJ0ZS1ibGFuYy0yMjQxODEv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvZGVzdGluYXRpb25zL2NhcnRlLWJsYW5jLTIyNDE4MS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With its unhurried expansion of the Cheval Blanc brand, LVMH is slowly but surely redefining the concept of a luxury hotel.

It is one of those quintessential Maldivian afternoons in which a single fluffy cloud sails across the sky like a slow-moving ship and the slender palm trees seem to stretch to the sun. My fantasy island—a football field–sized patch smothered by a mound of snow-white sand—is silent save for the whisper of a light breeze and the churning of the rising tide. I flatten myself across the surface of a daybed, attempting to lure the low sun’s rays onto every square inch of my body, and slowly drift off to sleep.

Pop! The cheerful explosion of a fresh bottle of Champagne snaps me back to reality, in which my island for one is actually Cheval Blanc Randheli, an exquisite new resort in the Maldives’ Noonu Atoll. Propping myself up against a bright yellow pillow, I scan the beach for the source of the sound. To my left and right, the fingerlike shadows of palm trees line empty white lounge chairs. Behind me, the turquoise swimming pool ripples only from the wind.

“Madame,” says my majordome, or butler, appearing suddenly at my side to place a bubbling flute in my hand. “I thought you might be thirsty.”

To be sure, the maisons of Cheval Blanc, the hotel brand of the French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton, present a spectacular version of reality. Cheval Blanc Randheli, which opened last November as the brand’s second property, immediately raised the bar in the Maldives—a country already flush with extravagant properties. The resort and its predecessor, Cheval Blanc Courchevel, are certainly not unique in the world of fashionable travel; Bulgari, Armani, and other high-luxury houses have all debuted their own hotel chains in recent years. LVMH, however, is slowly but surely—and unsurprisingly—establishing its particular brand of hospitality as the standard bearer in the field, if not for luxury hotels in general.

WATCH

LVMH’s first property opened in 2006 in the tony French Alps resort of Courchevel 1850, where Bernard Arnault, the conglomerate’s chairman and CEO, transformed a mountaintop chalet in the Jardin Alpin area into an haute-couture sanctuary. Extravagant details were in excess, from the atelier filled with Louis Vuitton products to the 37 rooms and suites adorned with miles of silk, leather, velvet, and fur. Stationed near the entrance to the maison (LVMH’s preferred term for its properties), a mirrored horse sculpture was erected as a symbol of the new hospitality brand, whose name is a reference to the group’s 150-year-old Château Cheval Blanc winery in St.-Émilion.

At the time, LVMH had been broadening its reach in the luxury world at a rapid pace. In the previous decade alone, it had acquired the Scottish whisky distiller Glenmorangie, the Dutch yacht manufacturer Royal Van Lent, Donna Karan International, and Tag Heuer, among others. The group had also announced plans, in 2001, to create Paris’s Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry–designed art museum that opened this October. The conglomerate’s aggressive expansion, however, did not carry over to its nascent hospitality brand. “Courchevel proved to be incredibly successful, but we knew we were entering a competitive world,” says Olivier Lefebvre, head of hotel activities for LVMH Hotel Management. “While it was an obvious extension for us as a luxury brand, it was important to us to get everything right before we went any further.”

(Continues on next page…)

Seven years after the formation of the Cheval Blanc brand, its private-island resort in the Maldives opened to resounding acclaim (including being named Robb Report’s Best of the Best resort in the June 2014 issue). Cheval Blanc Randheli stands apart in the island nation for its modern Jean-Michel Gathy design, its wine cellar filled with rare vintages of Château Cheval Blanc, and its spa featuring treatments by Guerlain, but most of all for the well-curated accoutrements and services that make the property an extraordinary home. Vibrant marble and quartz sand artworks that hang above the bean-shaped bathtubs in every villa are each part of a one-of-a-kind commission by the French artist Vincent Beaurin. Aboard the 45-villa resort’s custom seaplane, which is outfitted with calf-leather seats and a glossy yellow-and-taupe color scheme, monogrammed espadrilles and colorful canvas beach bags await

commuting passengers.

A similar attention to detail—a hallmark of LVMH’s many product brands over the years—can be found at Cheval Blanc Courchevel, where a Mongolian yurt has been transported and transformed into a cigar lounge, and a high-profile art collection includes photographs by Karl Lagerfeld and a bronze teddy-bear sculpture by Takashi Murakami called Kanye Bear (a tribute to Kanye West). Tastefully absent from plain sight, however, is the prominent stamp of LVMH’s most recognizable brands: Linens are free of logos, toiletries are displayed sans high-profile labels, and exclusive offerings such as the hotel’s private consultations with Guerlain’s creative director, Sylvanie Delacourte, are carried out subtly and without fanfare. “We consider Cheval Blanc a laboratory for services rather than just a showcase for our brands,” Lefebvre says. “You would never see the same furniture or artwork in any two of our properties, because every maison is completely unique.”

In keeping with Cheval Blanc’s mission, Lefebvre cites grand yet carefully calculated plans for the future. Currently in various stages of development are a retreat in Oman and a private-island resort on the Nile River in Aswan, Egypt. In 2012, Cheval Blanc announced plans to build its first city hotel, within Paris’s former La Samaritaine department store. The company also aims to open a resort in Mexico, in the exclusive Costa Careyes region south of Puerto Vallarta.

For its third maison, Cheval Blanc took on an existing property, transforming the 40-room Hotel Saint-Barth Isle de France to Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France. According to Lefebvre, the legendary Caribbean resort—known for its weekly fashion shows and glamorous Flamands Beach locale—was a natural addition to the collection. “We knew we needed to be on St. Barth, but we also knew we could not build something new on such a small island,” he says. “Isle de France is the best, so it was obvious where we would go.”

The hotel, which the company acquired in the summer of 2013, reopened in October with a spa featuring treatments by Guerlain, an expanded pool area, and the top-notch services of Cheval Blanc’s majordomes. Future plans call for the addition of a fitness center and four beachfront suites. Interior decor in the existing rooms has also been upgraded to match the subtle luxuries found at Courchevel and Randheli.

The enchanting unreality I first experienced at Cheval Blanc Randheli returns one brilliant afternoon on Isle de France’s pristine stretch of Flamands Beach. Sipping a mango smoothie, watching the shadow cast by my umbrella tiptoe farther and farther down the shoreline, I succumb to the hypnosis once again. This time, however, the chill of sundown is my wake-up call. Parched for something stronger than a smoothie, I hazily tread the cool powdery sand toward the resort’s evening bonfire, where padded sofas and tables topped with blooming hydrangeas are arranged at the receding water’s edge.

“Am I too early?” I ask the maître d’ upon discovering that I have the place all to myself. “Of course not,” he responds, leading me to a cozy seat with a view of the sunset. I stare out at the swirling mosaic of oranges and reds reflected in the sprawling sea before me when, suddenly, pop! The cork flies behind me, right on cue.

"As a Museum, Frank Gehry’s Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris Disappoints - artnet News","Thu, 06 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC9hcy1hLW11c2V1bS1mcmFuay1nZWhyeXMtZm9uZGF0aW9uLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24taW4tcGFyaXMtZGlzYXBwb2ludHMtMTU1MjQy0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFydG5ldC5jb20vYXJ0LXdvcmxkL2FzLWEtbXVzZXVtLWZyYW5rLWdlaHJ5cy1mb25kYXRpb24tbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1pbi1wYXJpcy1kaXNhcHBvaW50cy0xNTUyNDIvYW1wLXBhZ2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s the Sydney Opera House crossed with a blimp. So what happened here? The problem with this building, for me, is that it is so corporate, so safe, so sanitized in terms of its design and the art on display, while at the same time trying to be cool, that you come away from a hopeful visit to the new $143 million Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris feeling as if you have stepped out of a luxury retail store with a glass, mirrored interior courtesy Peter Marino.

It’s a shopping space sheathed in a prophylactic of art and creativity, an unimaginative building masked to look like an interesting and daring one. Not so long ago the fashion business swallowed the art world, and here, along with Art Basel in Miami Beach, is the apotheosis of that fatal absorption—everything that is radical, challenging, dirty, and difficult about contemporary art has been stripped away to reveal a handbag palace on steroids, complete with a bejeweled LV monogram on the outside entry wall.

The building was commissioned by Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of the luxury goods empire LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. It was envisaged as a contemporary art museum and performing arts center, a private museum in a country in which, well, there aren’t many private museums. That much is to be applauded and is even visionary. We are all better off for the establishment of this new public enterprise which will eventually be donated to the French republic. Bravo to Arnault and LVMH for that. And yet the corporate identity of the institution and its current funding model over-determine the entire look and feel of the place, not to mention its mission. Visiting the museum with a crowd of eager Parisians and tourists, I felt caught up in a publicity stunt more akin to the launch of a new fashion line or label than a serious endeavor to collect, show and conserve contemporary art. I felt excited for a new museum and disappointed at the same time.

Frank Gehry is the building’s architect. He has become a go-to guy for those looking to build signature museum buildings. The basic problem is that he has never equaled his Guggenheim Museum building in Bilbao; instead he has been churning out derivative, stripped-down designs for unimaginative, lazy clients looking for the image of innovation. Here the Fondation Louis Vuitton board knew what it was doing. In the business of building luxury brands, they wanted the appearance of innovation and creativity without actually having to provide or contend with it. This building is all about fashion, from the choice of the fashionable architect to the fashionable if mind-numbingly inoffensive art on display.

What about the art? Pierre Huyghe, Gerhard Richter, Thomas Schütte, Ellsworth Kelly, Bertrand Lavier, Taryn Simon, Sarah Morris, and Christian Boltanski are all good artists, sure, but what you have here for the opening display is the world’s most dull collection of their work. This stuff is so desperate not to make enemies, it’s going to have trouble making friends. Inside the Horizon (2014), a commission by Olafur Eliasson, is probably his least inspired and most forgettable artwork: 43 prism shaped columns of varying widths placed along the walkway in the grotto beside a water pool. Two of the sides are covered in mirrors and the third in a yellow blown glass, suggesting the work is all about reflections. It’s a piece of empty, light-driven decoration.

The museum itself is of questionable value as a functional space, because once you take away the exterior there are limited galleries, all of which look and feel a little awkward to me, with loads of glass and viewing areas designed more to admire the architecture than the art. Also, the lack of attention paid to movement and flow throughout the building is difficult to understand for an architect as experienced as Gehry—he is 85. A heralded reliance on “aerospace technology” and special 3-D software developed by Gehry Technologies (which made it possible to model complex shapes imagined for the exterior and is kind of interesting in a science-nerd sort of way) is redundant and irrelevant once inside, as everywhere image takes precedence over substance: Visitors struggle with limited restrooms, small elevators, and a tiny restaurant inadequate to the crowd capacity.

Bottom line is that it is hard to know where to go, or why, in this building, and even when you get there you are overwhelmed by a dispiriting sense of Why did I bother?

Showbiz agencies splash into fashion - K-pop Herald,"Sun, 09 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHA6Ly9tLmtwb3BoZXJhbGQuY29tL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMTQxMTA5MTcwOTA3OTI5MDk5NF8y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the surging rise of the “Hallyu Wave” ― especially the unprecedented popularity of K-pop globally ― local entertainment agencies have been riding high for some years now. However, concerned at its sustainability amid future uncertainties, they now appear to be tactically diversifying their business portfolios.



In particular, South Korea’s top three entertainment agencies ― YG Entertainment, SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment ― who have been the driving force behind this cultural sweep.



As noted by Kim Chang-kwon, an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities, “Expanding into other industries is regarded as a must now, since the future of the music business remains hazy.”



To manage the risks involved, YG Entertainment, which houses big name K-pop stars such as Psy, Big Bang and 2NE1, has been fast-expanding into non-music sectors.



Last month, YG launched its own cosmetics brand “Moonshot” in a joint venture with Guangzhou Hyuanya, China’s third-ranking cosmetics firm. YG said it gained direct access to the Chinese market through the company’s wide distribution channels.

In September, the agency also opened a street casual brand called NONAGON, co-founded by Samsung Group’s textile affiliate, Cheil Industries.Seeing a profit potential, the private equity arm of French luxury goods giant LVMH ― which owns Louis Vuitton, Cartier and other high-end brands ― is investing up to $80 million in YG’s fashion and makeup goods projects. It is one of the biggest bets made on the Hallyu Wave by a global fund.“From music and fashion to cosmetics, YG is solidifying its status as a lifestyle icon for the young generation,” said Kim and Park Jung-yub, another analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities, citing fashion and cosmetics as YG’s mid and long-term growth engines.SM Entertainment, which has Girls’ Generation, EXO and TVXQ in its lineup, is also diversifying by expanding its presence in travel, and in movies, TV dramas and musicals.With the acquisition of travel and music agencies, SM Culture and Contents ― an SM affiliate ― now provides business-to-business traveling services and content.Adopting a different strategy, JYP Entertainment is focusing only on music-related businesses. In 2012, it released Diamond Tears headphones in affiliation with U.S.-based audio equipment producer Monster.In 2011, the South Korean music business grew by a whopping 29 percent in terms of sales from 2.95 trillion won ($2.72 billion) to 3.81 trillion won, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.But in 2012, the growth was down to 4.6 percent, with the recording business posting 3.99 trillion of sales.“When the smartphone penetration rate here soared from 2 percent in 2009 to 14 percent in 2010, more people started to use mobile streaming services, and companies were creating new platforms for distributing music content,” said Lee Ik-joo, a researcher at the Korea Creative Content Agency, explaining the reason behind the decline.“However, there has not been a game-changing phenomenon like the smartphone for a while now.”According to the content agency’s report, recording sales showed a 11.1 percent growth for the 2012-2013 period.By Suk Gee-hyun (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9954153299331665}",neutral,0.9954153299331665,0

Lee Myung-bak

Former president

Former president Lee Myung-bak visited the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday to meet Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, according to media reports.

Sources familiar with the trip said Lee would spend two days with the UAE crown prince before returning to Korea on Monday.

Lee visited the UAE at the invitation of the crown prince, they said.

Lee will visit oil sites and the site where two nuclear reactors are being built with Korean technology.

The former president received the invitation shortly after he retired from the presidency in February 2013.

The businessman-turned-president promised to travel to the UAE after President Park Geun-hye's official visit. Park visited the Middle Eastern country in May.

A former official of the presidential office said, on condition of anonymity, that Lee and the UAE crown prince built strong ties before Lee was elected president.

""I understand that the two leaders are very close and deeply trust each other,"" he told the Korea Times. ""The UAE crown prince played a critical role in the Korean consortium being chosen to build two nuclear reactors in 2010.""

The former official said the UAE was interested in green growth and wanted Korea to help modernize its law enforcement authorities, military and industrial facilities to prepare for the post-oil era.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999481439590454}",neutral,0.9999481439590454,0
ABB bets on Asia amid uncertainties - 코리아타임스,"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzAzLzYwMl8xNjc4NzkuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTE2Nzg3OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Choi Kyong-ae





Ulrich Spiesshofer, head of ABB's global operations, talks about chances and challenges in Asia.

/ Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chul

ABB Ltd., the Zurich-based energy equipment supplier, is putting its faith in emerging markets weathering a prolonged global economic slowdown, the company's chief said last week.

In September, the world's number one maker of power grids announced its ""next level"" strategy to seek profitable growth. Hit by a slowdown in advanced markets, its net profit for three months ending Sept. 30 fell 12 percent to $734 million from $835 million a year earlier.

""If you take countries in Asia, there is still tremendous opportunity for ABB to contribute to our growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Spiesshofer told The Korea Times in a recent interview in Seoul.

""Korea has fantastic growth opportunity for ABB. If you look at underlying per-capita GDP growth in Korea, in 2017 this country will bypass 30,000 dollars."" Korea's per-capita GDP was $24,000 last year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

ABB has already established business ties with Korean customers and partners in fields such as automobiles, shipbuilding, semiconductors and electronics. Its big-name customers here include Samsung Electronics, Samsung Engineering, LG Electronics, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, with ABB providing them with power and automotive equipment to help them drive their productivity.

On top of its existing customers, ABB is seeking to expand further in Korea ― Asia's fourth-biggest economy ― by adding new clients.

Business collaborations between ABB and Korean companies normally go through a distinct process. It starts with a common understanding of the market; then joint marketing activities; this is followed by research and development (R&D); then the execution of projects and collaboration on robotics, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), Spiesshofer explained.

For further ties, Spiesshofer said he had discussions last week with Korean companies that were very interested in Africa and possible projects there. He also counted India and Indonesia as high-growth markets for ABB.

There are 600 million people in Africa and 400 million people in India who have no access to electricity today. ""If I look at the industry sector, food and beverages is one of the most steady-growing sectors in Indonesia and automation is the fastest growing sector in India. So there are good pockets for growth,"" said the CEO.

For ABB, the opportunity in Indonesia is primarily to bring power to its thousands of islands. He sees opportunities in Japan and China too.

The development of Japanese infrastructure is a major opportunity for ABB as the country is moving away from nuclear power into renewable energy after the Fukushima disaster of 2011. China is still the second largest market for ABB after the United States.

""Korea has a very open approach towards global companies like ours. Japan over the last five years has started to open up too,"" he said.

Spiesshofer didn't mention opportunities in Asia alone. As for challenges ahead, the CEO said, ""Our challenge is to attract enough educated people and keep them for the long term in our workforce.""

ABB employs 145,000 people globally in 100 countries. It has hired 800 in Korea where ABB's strongest sectors are marine technology and EPC. ABB also makes industrial robots and other automation machinery.

As for the business outlook for 2015, he expects quite bit of uncertainty in the world.

""The financial crisis is not over. We see tremendous competition going on in the field of energy, we see the health crisis in Africa, we see the political unrest in the Middle East and other places,"" he said.

Given the speed of development, opportunities of penetration and industrialization, Spiesshofer was more optimistic about Asia compared to other advanced markets.

The power and automation market is valued at $600 billion globally and this market will grow to about $750 billion by 2020, he said. Last year, ABB earned 46 percent of its revenue from emerging markets, with the remainder coming from developed countries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7215200066566467}",neutral,0.7215200066566467,0
"Aldo Magada, President and CEO of Zenith: In Conversation - - Deployant","Tue, 11 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZGVwbG95YW50LmNvbS9jb252ZXJzYXRpb24tYWxkby1tYWdhZGEtcHJlc2lkZW50LWNlby16ZW5pdGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recently, the CEO of Zenith, Mr Aldo Magada, came down to Singapore to witness the opening of their boutique in Marina Bay Sands. The folks at Deployant had the opportunity to catch up with the affable gentleman on the Zenith Tour Bus, which took us on a tour around the sunny isle in Southeast Asia.

First off, we congratulated Mr Magada on his appointment, even though it was a little belated. Well, better late than never! Swiftly, we talked about his new job, and the challenges that he had faced so far. Mr Magada told us that he is pleased with his appointment, as Zenith is a great brand and a great manufacturer of fine watches. The fact that LVMH is giving him a lot of freedom makes his job much more exciting and interesting as well, as it does not restrict his team to be creative and do something different from their competitors.

On the subject of work, we were curious to know what is it like to work under the legendary Jean-Claude Biver. Mr Magada smiled, half expecting us to ask him this particular question. He had nothing but praises for the incredible man. Mr Magada told us that Mr Biver is a demanding, but an extremely knowledgeable and hardworking man. The bigwig figure believes that nothing is impossible, which is why he does not take “no” for an answer. Having said that, Mr Magada added that working with Mr Biver is invaluable, and that had helped him to gain plenty of wonderful experiences which helped him drastically in his foray into horology.

We went back to the topic on Zenith, after digressing a little on other subjects. Several questions regarding the collection were exchanged, especially with reference to the future of Zenith’s offerings. We were told that there will not be much changes to the current Zenith lineup, as they will continue to develop and realize the potential that his predecessor, Mr Dufour, had set in place. The brand is also looking to consolidate and simplify their collection. The most important thing, according to Mr Magada, is that consumers must understand who Zenith are. However, he added that they have a collection that focuses on haute horlogerie, in which they will be placing more resources into it. There are basically no limitations there; the watches created will be rather extraordinary and different from what the current lineup has to offer. We will be keeping our eyes peeled on that.

Next, we follow up with the macro-side of the business. We were told that the largest market for Zenith pieces are in Asia, mainly Hong Kong, China, and Japan. He reckons that the trend is due to the design of their watches; it is pretty Asian-oriented. The watches have a timeless design, which is a preference of Asians. On top of it, Zenith pieces are value for money, which is also why they are able to attract astute Asian collectors. Having said that, Zenith is also focusing on other markets, such as USA and Europe. Mr Magada noted that the financial situation in Europe may not be favorable currently, but he foresees that the situation will change for the better.

2014 has not been a favorable year for all, including Zenith. That is greatly due to the tighter spending in many markets. 2015 will hopefully be better, says Mr Magada. He expects the growth to be steady, but not opportunistic. Hence, he is working towards long term growth, rather than unsustainable but spectacular short term results (but he emphasized that the company needs to have reasonable growth in the short term as well). The future certainly looks bright for Zenith here.

Talking about long term growth, we went on to discuss on the future of horology. Mr Magada firmly believes that horology will still be relevant, even after many decades from now. It is because watch is a luxury good, not a necessity; people will continue to buy it because they appreciate the provenance and the efforts behind the creation of a timepiece. While the market may be hurt by the improvement of technologies (e.g. the Apple Watch, smartphones), it should be insignificant as it targets a different market base.

Since we were talking about Apple Watch, we asked the man for his thoughts on it. It was, in his opinion, disappointing. The smartwatch is an existing product, and some of their competitors are producing better watches than what Apple did. Also, the lack of water resistance function on a sport watch is upsetting. Overall, he feels that it is a little over-hyped; he was expecting something a little crazier, to say the least.

Taking the conversation to a personal level, we discussed on watch collecting. Mr Magada shared that the Rolex Submariner is his favorite timepiece. Not just any Submariner, but the one he received from his Grandfather when he was twenty years old. While the Rolex Submariner is an iconic piece, it is the emotional and sentimental value behind that particular Submariner that makes it very special- and it is something that we can all relate to. He also added that he has bought and sold quite a few pieces along the way, as the watches do not gain enough wrist time. This is out of respect and integrity for the company that he works for.

Apart from watches, Mr Magada also shares with us his passion for wines and cars. We got a little carried away, since all of us here shares an interest in automobiles as well. We concur that classic cars are splendid, at least when it comes to the looks and the philosophy behind it. Well, there are not many cars that are built with the same soul and passion these days.

Soon, we concluded our conversation, as the tour bus reaches its destination. We thank Mr Magada for his time, as well as Zenith for making this possible.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9812020063400269}",neutral,0.9812020063400269,0

NEW DELHI: Swiss watch brand Tag Heuer plans to tweak its collections and improve instore services as it bets on enhancing customer experience to power the next phase of growth in India, a top executive said.“The brand is doing well here and has a great platform to go forward. As the next step, we want to do some qualitative work. The focus will be on customer experience,” said Amit Chaloo general manager at Tag Heuer India . The brand, owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, is currently one of the top three in the Swiss watches category in terms of revenue and recall value in the country, Chaloo said.He said Tag Heuer will focus on having the right collections and being at the right retail shops rather than chasing numbers mindlessly. “We want to get into the finer details of selling a luxury watch to the Indian consumer. The numbers (sales) are being met, what is missing is the brand experience,” said Chaloo.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9977514147758484}",positive,0.9977514147758484,1

It was an evening of unmatched glamour and aesthetic allure, when 400 leading individuals from the world of luxury, fashion, media business and society gathered to celebrate Italian jewellery and luxury goods brand Bulgari’s store opening in New Delhi last week.

Described as ‘the party-of-the-year’ and hosted by Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin at the Taj Palace, the evening featured a unique melding of the best of India and Europe in the form of a spectacular fashion-set, showcasing glamorous Bulgari High Jewellery pieces paired with the unrivalled creations of Anamika Khanna’s couture designs - an exclusive association between the luxury Maison and one of India’s most respected and talented fashion couturiers.

As if that were not enough, the presence of some of the country’s most elusive and coveted personalities like Kolkata’s all powerful and rarely seen publishing tycoon Aveek Sarkar, industrialist Sanjiv Goenka with wife Preeti, Udaipur’s Maharana Arvind Singh Mewar, Hindustan Times publisher Shobhana Bhartia, Bulgari’s attractive MD Wong Weiling, LVMH Group President & L Capital Managing Partner Ravi Thakran, amongst others who added to the evening’s elegance and high voltage glamour.

Designed by Anamika Khanna and Sumant Jayakrishnan, with wall-to-wall images of Bulgari’s iconic international clientele that included Liz Taylor and Sophia Loren, guests were riveted as the impossibly leggy and statuesque Talia Bentson sashayed down the sinewy ramp dressed in an Anamika ensemble singing out jazz hits, followed by a gaggle of exquisitely clad models.

The dinner that consisted of tables groaning with delicacies of unlimited truffles, oysters, green lip mussels, lobster, burrata and artichokes, paired with fine wines and unlimited champagne was another highlight. “Easily one of the most elegant and well attended parties in Delhi,” said a Capital insider. “And the jewels, fabulous!”

6 degrees of separation

In which we join the dots...



Bimla Nanda Bissell: The grand dame of Delhi's intelligentsia and culturati, Bim Bissell, married to FabIndia founder, the late John Bissell, has variously in her long and illustrious career, run the Playhouse school that incubator of Delhi's best and brightest; served as social secretary to Ambassadors Galbraith and Chester Bowles in Delhi and worked with the World Bank. Known as the Capital's hostess with the mostest, each year she moves for a few months to New York's Upper West Side where the pedigree of her guests is said to be equally, if not more, impressive.



Payal Jauhar: One of the most dynamic, quiet and respected names in the universe of international luxury, Payal Jauhar, Associate Group Director LVMH India and L Capital, is the daughter of the family that owned the grand old lady of Mussoorie, The Savoy, along with those other north Indian F&B phenomena, Gaylord and Kwality. A successful restaurateur in her own right, Jauhar currently divides her time between Singapore and Delhi, when she's not hobnobbing with international cognoscenti in Paris and Milan.

How they are related: Bim’s first cousin is Payal’s dad’s first cousin.

Other relatives of this talented duo are Rediffusion's founder and CMD Arun Nanda, style aficionado and Rajiv Gandhi's friend Romi Chopra, founder member of IIM-A, Dr Kamla Choudhary, MD FabIndia William Bissell, writer actress Monsoon Bissell, former wife of ex-Defence Minister Nina Singh and jewellery whiz Hanut Singh.

Bitterly fought elections

The goodfellas at the RWITC are at it again. With elections in mid December, word comes in that campaigning is so contentious that it puts the Vijay Mallya vs Cyrus Poonawalla battle to shame.



Vivek Jain and Khushroo Dhunjibhoy

Readers will recall past elections when figures as prominent as Cyrus Poonawalla, Vijay Mallya, Jaydev Modi, current RWITC chairman Vivek Jain and Khushroo Dhunjibhoy, have used their considerable clout to swing votes towards themselves or their candidates.

This time the team led by Khushroo Dhunjibhoy, who sources claim has already hosted a string of parties is allegedly wooing the female vote by hosting a fashion soiree by Dior, at the Presidential Suite of the Taj Lands End tomorrow. “Gifts worth thousands of rupees will be showered on the ladies who attend!” says the source.

Meanwhile, team Vivek Jain, claims to be relatively low key. “Other than one party at the Dome, the few others are at private residences,” said Jain, the recipient of a caustic missive from a few members alleging losses of Rs15 lakh for the current year, amongst other things.

Oh boy, fur will fly.

JCS resurrected

It’s known the world over as the greatest musical of all time and the last time we heard about Alyque Padamsee’s ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ it was in 1974 and we had gone to audition for a role as an understudy.



Madhukar Chandra Das as Jesus

Starring Madhukar Chandra Das as Jesus, Nandu Bhende as Judas, Sharon Prabhakar as Mary Magdalene and our own sister Devieka Bhojwani as Mother Mary, the play had been a sell out, and raised the bar for future musical productions in the country.

And now, in what is a resurrection befitting of its theme, JCS is being directed thirty years later by Padamsee once again and will star Bhojwani once more in the role she reprised three decades ago!

A feat as unprecedented as the fact that a Padma Bhushan (Akbar Padmasee on Visual Design) and two Padma Shris (Wendell Rodricks on Costumes and Alyque Padamsee on Direction) are working on the production.

Produced by Raell Padamsee’s Ace Productions, the musical boasting a cast of over a 100 multi-singers and choreographed by Shiamak Davar is said to have already broken all records with its five premier shows sold out.

“It’s a must see production and will leave the Indian audiences enthralled!” As for that time that we’d auditioned as an understudy? We didn’t make the cut. Ah well, win some, lose some...","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0
"7 things in her bag: Rachel Marouani, Women News - AsiaOne","Wed, 12 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL3dvbWVuLzctdGhpbmdzLWhlci1iYWctcmFjaGVsLW1hcm91YW5p0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Ms Rachel Marouani was a little girl growing up in Paris, she imagined selling shoes one day. While still a shoehound, today the grown-up Ms Marouani works with a different kind of accessory - fine jewellery - as the chief executive of high-end French jewellery brand Fred.

""Nobody wears jewellery without a story,"" the 42-year-old Parisian says in an interview with Urban. ""People can remember things like the mood they were in when they bought it, or who gave it to them, or how old they were at the time.""

Ms Marouani became the head of Fred, founded in 1936, in early 2012. Now under the LVMH group, its main presence is in France, Monaco, Japan and South Korea. She was in town last week for the official opening of the first Fred store in South-east Asia at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

Asked to describe Fred jewellery, words like ""colour"", ""easy"" and ""modern"" emerge in the conversation. The label is known for its use of colourful gems and unfussy pieces, and also its past ties to luminaries such as Princess Grace of Monaco and Hollywood actress Marlene Dietrich.

Prices of the jewellery here range from $1,320 for a white gold ring to $197,425 for a diamond necklace.

""The brand's founder, Mr Fred Samuels, had a name card saying 'modern jeweller-designer',"" she says. ""Even today, it's all about how to stay modern looking.""

With that in mind, Ms Marouani introduced the innovative Pain de Sucre (sugarloaf) ring in November last year. The best-selling ring features a candy-coloured gemstone that can be removed and interchanged with different gemstones.

""We wanted to make something for women with character, a piece that they could change based on their emotion and how they feel,"" she says.

Prior to Fred, Ms Marouani spent seven years at the similarly LVMH-owned beauty emporium Sephora as head of marketing and customer relations, developing its e-commerce capabilities and programmes such as the loyalty card.

It was an easy decision to join Fred when given the opportunity, adds the single mother of a four-year-old son. Her stylish grandmother had worn pieces from Fred and she knew the brand name.

And the new job, she says, is not so different from the Sephora gig despite the leap in price point because she has always been focused on making customers happy.

She also enjoys the entrepreneurial challenge of growing a small company. While it has the backing of a group like LVMH, Fred is still small-scale compared to Sephora, with only about 40 people in its head office. Developing a bigger presence overseas is important and opening in Singapore is a start, she notes.

""I take the plane like others take the bus,"" says Ms Marouani, who travels every 15 days or so, both for work and occasionally leisure. ""But I was keen to do this.""

7 THINGS IN HER BAG

1. CELINE SUNGLASSES

These are easy to wear and are great when the sun is out. Even when the sun is not out, I like to carry them around in Paris in the hope of some sunshine.

2. ASSORTED MAKE-UP

I prefer a natural look when it comes to make-up.

I like this Benefit mascara, Sephora lip gloss and Dior eyeshadow.

3. NAME CARDS

I have name cards printed in English, French, Japanese and Mandarin because we are present in different markets. It helps with name pronunciation.

4. FRED INTERCHANGEABLE GEMS

I usually have about five colour variations in a jewellery pouch. I like to change the gem of the Pain de Sucre ring at least twice a day according to how I feel.

5. RUBBER BALL

My son loves to play with this kind of thing. You can use these small rubber balls in pinball machines.

6. SEPHORA NAIL POLISH REMOVER

I don't like having chipped nail polish as I sometimes have to show off the jewellery on my hand. I carry this easy-to-use remover, which comes in a travel-friendly packet.

7. MARC JACOBS POUCH

Sometimes, my days can be very long, so I usually pack another pouch or clutch that I can use for dinner or evening events.

5 questions with Bianca Bai - TODAY - TODAY,"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvNS1xdWVzdGlvbnMvNS1xdWVzdGlvbnMtYmlhbmNhLWJhadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE — Fred Samuel was only 28 years old when he opened his first FRED store in Paris back in 1936, attracting an ardent following that included the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Princess Grace of Monaco and Yvonne Printemps.

Since then, Samuel has crafted a string of jewels for films, including the transcendent necklace containing 23 rubellites worn by Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and the decadent pair of yellow gold earrings worn by Caterina Murino in the 007 film, Casino Royale. FRED has also been a part of the LVMH group since 1995.

Today, his following includes Taiwanese actress Bianca Bai, who was one of the luminaries to grace the opening of the French jeweller’s first flagship boutique in South-east Asia at Marina Bay Sands.

Bai enthused: “I really love the Belle Rives collection. I like how the different coloured gems are carefully placed together; it really showcases the designer’s clever eye for detail and skill. It looks really good on any skin tone. I also really like the Force 10 collection because it is versatile. It can be casual, slightly masculine and very elegant at the same time, depending on how I dress. I actually wear the Force 10 bracelet every day!”

Don’t be quick to brush Bai off as being high maintenance, though; she has an endearing, child-like side to her persona.

“With the movie, Frozen, being such a big hit, I am actually thinking of dressing up as Elsa this Christmas!” she laughed. “But if I don’t dress up as Elsa, I will probably just wear something simple and comfortable, paired with a pair of heels or wedges which are more stable and better for walking.”

Q: How would you describe your style?

A: My dressing is more casual and the item I like the most is a white crisp shirt because it is versatile and can be worn from day to night. I normally pair my white shirt with a pair of white jeans.

Q: So how do you jazz up your casual outfit?

A: I prefer unique jewellery, shoes and bags to match my outfit. For example, I prefer brightly coloured bags and shoes. For jewellery, I like classic pieces because I can wear them for a long time.

Q: What are some of your favourite accessories?

A: My favourites are bracelets and earrings. I believe that when you are unfamiliar with someone whom you are meeting for the first time, the jewellery one wears will tell you plenty about that person.

Q: Is jewellery a good investment?

A: I like to buy items that can be worn for a long time, maybe for 10 to 20 years. I feel jewellery is a good investment, something that can be worn for a long time. You can even pass it on to your children. I feel that every woman should invest and purchase some unique pieces of jewellery, be it bracelets, rings or necklaces.

Q: What are other items every woman should have in her wardrobe?

A: I believe that every woman should have white and black tops — be it shirts, singlets or tank tops — as these are easy to match and are comfortable; a scarf as it can keep one warm and stylish especially during autumn and winter; a comfortable pair of high heels as everyone’s feet is shaped differently, so it is important to find a pair that suits your feet well and a versatile everyday bracelet.
