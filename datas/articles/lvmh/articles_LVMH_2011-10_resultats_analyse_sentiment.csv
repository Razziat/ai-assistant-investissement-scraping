Despite rising prices of leather materials, Louis Vuitton had numerous crocodile jackets on its runway this week, which made the timing ripe for LVMH to invest in its very own crocodile supplier (as Hermès did last year). The company announced via press release this morning that they’ve reached a deal to acquire Heng Long, a Singapore-based tannery founded by the Koh family in the fifties. The family retains joint ownership and management.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998306035995483}",neutral,0.9998306035995483,0
"India Inspired: Luxury Inc such as Hermes, Jimmy Choo, Etro, Canali and Ermenegildo Zegna goes desi to woo Gen X - The Economic Times","Sat, 01 Oct 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvaW5kaWEtaW5zcGlyZWQtbHV4dXJ5LWluYy1zdWNoLWFzLWhlcm1lcy1qaW1teS1jaG9vLWV0cm8tY2FuYWxpLWFuZC1lcm1lbmVnaWxkby16ZWduYS1nb2VzLWRlc2ktdG8td29vLWdlbi14L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMTkwMDEwLmNtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW DELHI: International luxury brands such as Hermes and Jimmy Choo are increasingly tapping into India 's rich cultural heritage as they begin to expand in one of the most promising markets the same way fast food chain McDonald's did with its McAloo Tikki and McSpicy Paneer.

A handful of international luxury brands such as Etro Canali and Ermenegildo Zegna have been increasingly rolling out India-inspired products, from clutches and watches to shoes and jackets, to woo a growing tribe of young entrepreneurs and executives that is driving a boom in the Indian luxury market.

""They (the young and rich Indian consumers) are adventurous and want to try Indian designs even in foreign luxury brands,"" says Priya Sachdev Chatwal, chief operating officer and creative director, TSG International Marketing, which represents brands such as Alexander McQueen, Lanvin and Stella McCartney in the country.

Tikka Shatrujit Singh, chief representative in Asia for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, says more Indianness in luxury products will help brands.

""India is a very special market. It has its own idiosyncrasies and a unique style of dressing. It's a great opportunity for western cuts to work with Indian designs,"" says Singh. He would know, being the great grandson of Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, one of the biggest customers of Louis Vuitton and other luxury brands in the 19th century.

So, Yves Carcelle, global CEO of French fashion house LVMH, could follow in the footsteps of his predecessors who went the 'when in India, be Indian' way decades ago to dig into the pockets of Maharajas with customised and India-inspired watches, trunks and bags.

Some of the world's top fashion labels are already doing it, to win over a much wider base of young, hip and affluent Indian customers. The country has nearly two lakh individuals with assets of $1 million or more. This number is expected to more than double by 2015.

French fashion house Hermes will launch its limited edition India sari collection early October, while shoes and accessories brand Jimmy Choo has launched the 'Chandra' clutch especially for India.

Italian luxury heritage brand Etro has launched its India jackets in the autumn-winter collection for 2011, going the way of Canali and Ermenegildo Zegna that have already launched jackets with Indian design. Through such products, luxury brands are able to gain acceptance in the country.

""It creates awareness and visibility,"" says Chatwal of TSG International Marketing. She says 12-15% of Alexander McQueen brand's sales are made up of Rajasthani jackets and other India-inspired apparel. For Canali too, 15% of sales come from its India product. With sales in Europe and the US falling or flattening, luxury goods makers are now focusing on emerging economies to grow their business.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996442794799805}",neutral,0.9996442794799805,0
