The creation of the vintage begins at the end of summer, when the grapes, picked at optimum ripeness, give life to as many wines as there are parcels. Each of them has a unique personality, and will be left for several months in new oak barrels, which preserve their character. At the start of spring, after several months of fermentation, the wines are tasted one by one. Only 15 to 35 of them will be selected to make the grand vin, and for this there is only one criterion: excellence. The painstaking process that is the art of blending involves deciding on the proportions of each wine that will go into making that year’s vintage. This vintage, the finesse, length and balance of which are exceptional, will then be left to age for a year in the barrel house. A reinterpretation of the Cheval Blanc legend."

This now legendary address is located a short distance from the Galerie Vivienne that was home to the House’s first Parisian boutique in 1970. In 1640, Jacques Coquet, the treasurer of France and controller-general of finances for Paris, asked the architect Pierre Le Muet to build him a mansion with two wings, one looking out onto the street and the other between a courtyard and a garden.

Through exchanges, sales, division and inheritance, it passed from owner to owner, including the Marquis de Mallebois, Master of Requests and Colbert’s nephew, the Marquis de Fontenay-Trésigny, war minister under Louis XV, before becoming, in a fitting twist of fate, a House selling silk and wool. Shaped by time, 18 rue Vivienne today houses most of the Kenzo departments, including the studio, the workshop, the support functions and product development, and today powerfully embodies the House’s spirit."

The makers of Louis Vuitton confirmed on its first quarter revenue analyst conference call today that it is trying to crack down on people buying luxury goods in bulk in Europe and then selling them on in China, in what it calls ""the grey market.""

""When you have soaring currencies and increasing price gaps on grey market, you see some market dilution. We've placed strict retail restrictions for the amount of products that people can buy,"" said Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH on the conference call. ""But, when you see someone in a store, you don't know whether they are buying handbags for themselves or to sell them onto the market in China. We are trying to make sure we are not competing with our own products in the China market but our actions are not entirely bullet proof.""

Effectively, LVMH is worried it will involuntarily cannibalise its own sales. This is because if people are ""successfully"" buying its brands in bulk overseas and selling it at a discount in China, it will find itself trying to compete price-wise with the black marketers.

Buying luxury goods in the US and European market is an attractive prospect for mainland Chinese residents. This is because the average price of luxury goods in China, according to estimations by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, is is around 51% higher than in the United States and 72% higher than in France.

While the goods hold a hefty price tag anyway, import duties range from 10% to 25%, while that type of tax on luxury cosmetic products and alcohol can rise to 60%.

This is not to mention VAT being around 17%.

Other China troubles

Although LVMH reported a huge 16% rise in revenue for the first quarter revenue of 2015, climbing to €8.3 billion, China is shaving away at its margins.

The revenue jump was not down to organic growth.

A weak euro against the dollar boosted LVMH sales and a strong performance from its key brand Louis Vuitton helped its ""excellent start to the year"" in Europe and the US.

On a like-for-like basis revenue growth rose 3%, compared to the same period in 2014. Until five years ago, LVMH used to report 10%-plus growth rates year after year. Those days are gone. The brand's revenue hasn't hit the double-digit growth rates for two years or more, if you don't count currency fluctuations.

But like most luxury brands, LVMH revealed that it is still being hit by China.

Tough trading in China hit LVMH's wines and spirits unit, which includes the Hennessy cognac brand. According to the group's Q1 results, wines and spirits sales fell 1% compared to the last period.

But this is still better than the 3-4% drop predicted by analysts:

Since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power two years ago, the country has cracked down on ""gifting,"" the practice of offering very expensive gifts to company executives or people in power.

While it is a long-standing tradition in Asia, the practice has fallen under scrutiny because of a range of corruption cases filed against government officials and company executives.

due to the slowdown in sales growth in China. The larger the company's exposure is to Asia, the worst trouble the company seems to be in.

Some brands like Chanel have already taken aggressive steps to buoy up sales. It adopted a new global pricing policy which meant it cut prices in China by 22% while also hiking up prices in Europe by 20%.

Prada neglected to follow the same route and instead cut prices in China but said it wouldn't increase prices in Europe in order to ""protect local demand."" It posted a 1% fall in revenue to £2.6 billion ($3.8 billion) for 2014 and a 28% plunge in profits.

LVMH said today on the analyst conference call that is it not interested in following in Chanel's footsteps.

""We do not think a unified pricing structure makes any sense for luxury brands,"" said LVMH's CFO Guiony. ""The main reason is because it does not give flexibility for currency fluctuations.

""It's hard to know how price movements are affecting Chanel. It was pretty recent and they don't report their figures on a regular basis, so frankly I have no idea [how it's affecting the company's sales]. We've seen queues in front of Chanel stores in Hong Kong and China but you don't know if they were just there for the immediate discount.

""What we've learned from the past is that you don't act too quickly. Currencies fluctuate a lot and you don't want to be in a situation that you can't control.""

While cutting prices seems a good option, to some, Barclays' analysts point out that it is still a risky route to take for a luxury brand for other reasons (emphasis ours):

""We continue to see a key risk here the soft luxury industry from price cuts as we highlighted in our note Price cuts a key risk for soft luxury (April 1st). While we expect some price realignment from Louis Vuitton, the magnitude of Chanel’s price adjustments may be tricky to replicate given the risk to alienate local demand in Europe in particular at the entry price point and potentially hurt brand equity in China.""

Brand equity is a huge deal for luxury goods makers. Their items need to carry an air of exclusivity and decadence that the average shopper wouldn't be able to afford. This is how they are able to charges thousands of pounds for a sweater or $50,000 for a handbag.

Showing your wealth through by carrying around items of clothing is part of the parcel for the nouveau rich. If a brand is seen as too common, then the wealthy start spending thousands of pounds elsewhere.

Take a look at Michael Kors in the US. The American brand enjoyed a stunning rise in popularity in recent years thanks to its trendy handbags and watches. However, the relative affordability of its goods led to widespread popularity. This was the ""kiss of death for trendy fashion brands, particularly those positioned in the up-market younger consumer sectors,"" according to industry expert Robin Lewis in his blog.

According to HSBC managing director Erwan Rambourg in his new book, ""The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun,"" brands that become too accessible are less appealing to super rich buyers.

In fact, Louis Vuitton is already at risk in China of alienating its shoppers with price cuts because it is considered as a ""brand for secretaries"" by many wealthy Chinese.

Luckily though, according to a diagram made by Rambourg about the hierarchy of brands, LVMH's Berluti label is near the top.

Overall, LVMH's Fendi, Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo and Berluti brands, were up 13% in the first quarter this year at €2.98 billion."

French luxury goods group LVMH posted a 3 percent rise in like-for-like first-quarter sales on Monday, helped by the weak euro against the dollar and what it called an ""excellent start to the year"" at Louis Vuitton.

A shopper looks at the window display of a Louis Vuitton store, operated by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA.

Wines and spirits sales fell 1 percent on a comparable basis in the first quarter, LVMH said in a statement. Still, this was better than the 3-4 percent decline expected by analysts.

Despite the situation in China, LVMH said Hennessy cognac had an overall increase in volume thanks to the ""strength of the U.S. market.""

The group's fashion and leather unit, the bulk of which is made up of Louis Vuitton sales, saw revenue rise only 1 percent like-for-like, significantly below the 9 percent rise in the year-ago period and 4 percent increase in the fourth quarter.

Many analysts expected a rise of at least 2 percent.

LVMH said, however, that last year's comparative figure was boosted by shoppers in Japan snapping up Louis Vuitton bags and other luxury goods ahead of a VAT hike on April 1.

""This is not a home run, but a very solid set of results,"" said Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst Luca Solca.

Analysts expect management to give a more detailed trading update, particularly regarding its performance in Asia, during a conference call scheduled for 1300 GMT on Tuesday.

LVMH's overall first-quarter sales rose 16 percent on a reported basis to 8.323 billion euros ($8.80 billion).

Joseph Henriot, who also spent several years as head of Champagne Veuve Clicquot and was also head of Charles Heidsieck prior to that, died this week aged 79.

‘He was one of the men of the 20th Century for the wine industry,’ said Gerard Basset OBE MS MW on the sidelines of the Decanter World Wine Awards judging week in London.

Henriot’s death follows that of Burgundy biodynamic pioneer Anne-Claude Leflaive and California wine veteran Joseph Phelps in the last few weeks.

Having trained as an agricultural engineer, Henriot managed his family house from 1962 until the acquisition by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) in 1987. He had also been head of Charles Heidsieck before the Henriot family sold the house to Remy Martin in 1985.

Under the LVMH umbrella, Henriot was president of Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin and is also credited with having advised the group to invest in Cloudy Bay in New Zealand. But, in 1994, he agreed to buy back his family house from LVMH and became president of Champagne Henriot, where he focused on Premiers Crus and Grands Crus vineyards.

Henriot also bought Burgundy negociant Maison Bouchard in 1995 and then William Fevre in Chablis in 1998. His last acquisition was Villa Ponciago, situated in Fleurie in Beaujolais.

French wine writer Bernard Burtschy told Decanter.com that Henriot was a ‘visionary and dynamic entrepreneur who understood how make fine wines and where to invest, particularly in Burgundy and Beaujolais’.

Her apt use of case-study teaching methods helped bridge the gap between the theoretical and the practical. Her passion for teaching and research was motivating, and this was a passion she also imparted to her students. We left her class not only with more knowledge and experience but also with more passion for our own work and our own futures. Professor Prokopec went out of her way to spend time with her students outside the classroom, as well, and for many of us that made her more than just a teacher: she was also a mentor, especially to women like myself entering the business world.

Louis Vuitton And The Power Of The Logo - Forbes India,"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2luZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xpdmUvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hbmQtdGhlLXBvd2VyLW9mLXRoZS1sb2dvLzQwMDkxLzHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image: Getty Images The flagship Louis Vuitton store in Paris is a popular tourist spot

No one understands the power of a logo better than LVMH. When the luxury house decided to bring its eponymous label Louis Vuitton to Mumbai in 2004, it chose a space in the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at Apollo Bunder. The finest champagne flowed through the day, and to announce its arrival it lit the beautiful, heritage structure of the Gateway of India with the monogram. It was done so subtly and elegantly that no one took umbrage and the brand slipped into the Indian subconscious almost as if it had always been there. Company spokespeople will be quick to remind you that LVMH has an old relationship with the country. Indian royal families used to get custom-made trunks from Paris and London way back in the late 19th century and right up to the mid 20th century.



LV grabbed eyeballs similarly when it planted a giant suitcase outside Bangalore airport in 2008 to announce its arrival. A slightly different approach, but it served to remind those who didn’t know that the brand was all about the voyage. In fact, its roots lay in creating gear that made it possible for 19th century adventurers and explorers to reach their destination in style: The raison d’etre of the brand is in the fact that it was one of the first houses to truly understand that travel will be what makes the world go round.



It is no wonder then that Forbes placed Louis Vuitton as the world’s most valuable luxury brand in November 2014. But the reason for its success lies in more than its larger-than-life brand launches. Louis Vuitton is often the first bag an upwardly mobile woman in Asia will buy. And it will remain her go-to bag. The reason is simple and fairly straightforward. Its hugely identifiable logo immediately places you in a world of aspiration and desire—a world of discernment that can be accessed through a price tag.



Just like travel did away with boundaries, the fact that you could buy social status changed age-old hierarchies. Anyone who understood that knew they stood to gain. LV recognised this early. Founded in 1854, it was only in 1896 that Louis Vuitton’s son Georges created the monogram, in honour of his late father. But it was also to ensure that the copycats could not muscle into its territory. The brand describes the use of the logo as “one of the first exercises in elevated branding and a defining sign of a global culture to come”.



One of my favourite memories of Paris is sitting on a bench on the Champs Élysées, chain-smoking and people watching. Most French hotels refuse to let you check in until 4 pm—and given that flights out of India have you at the Charles de Gaulle airport by 8.30 am, a large part of your day is spent loitering. My fashion director (at Elle India) and I would religiously study luxury house store windows as they are works of art. Their aesthetics are quirky and topical. I remember when Hugo Boss inverted its entire display. It was fabulous to see chairs, desks, a grand piano and its famous suit defy gravity.









(This story appears in the Mar-Apr 2015 issue of ForbesLife India. To visit our Archives, click here.)

Clockwise from top left: A pair of boxing gloves designed by Karl Lagerfeld; architect Frank Gehry’s design is part of the brand’s ‘Celebrating Monogram’ project; Takashi Murakami’s multi-coloured take on the monogramIt was also the first time that I saw queues outside a store. Clearly, a visit to the flagship LV store is like a holy pilgrimage for the Chinese. Armed with their wallets, they are perfectly happy to wait for their chance to pay their respects to the monogram. Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the largest number of fake LV bags (it is one of the most counterfeited brands in the world) now come from China.But the brand is more than just about location, location, location. Its growth chart is peppered with creative associations to give it fresh energy, thereby allowing it to remain both traditional and contemporary. In 1996, LV associated with designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Manolo Blahnik, and Isaac Mizrahi to celebrate the monogram. With the hiring of Marc Jacobs as creative director in 1997, the tie-ups became cheekier and more modern. Think artist Stephen Sprouse and his graffiti on the hallowed monogram. Or Takashi Murakami’s multi-coloured monogram which bordered on bad taste but stayed contained within the realm of quirky and kistchy. A huge hit in Asia (particularly back home), I recall a French style editor sneering at it: She insisted that the same money would be better spent on seeking a shrink. Last year, there were no such complaints when the new creative head, Nicolas Ghesquière, gave the ‘Celebrating Monogram’ project an even more seditious edge by asking ‘iconoclasts’ like Karl Lagerfeld, Frank Gehry and Rei Kawakubo among others to create new lines. The collaborations have thrown up a bag with pebble shaped holes and a punching bag with matching gloves.What these associations really reinforce is the power of the logo. One of the reasons French luxury brands endure is because they take their heritage very seriously. Louis Vuitton’s museum in Asnieres is where the man himself stayed. It houses never-to-be-seen examples of the brand’s craftmanship like the travel pieces created for modern-day explorers. Similarly, Hermès has a musuem at 24, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré—where the store has been located since 1880—that houses the family’s art and objet collections and inspirations. Mademoiselle Chanel’s apartment at 31, rue Cambon is where Karl Lagerfeld goes for inspiration. It is still as she left it.But popularity comes at a price. Today, LV is being dismissed as a bag for secretaries in China. According to an article carried in Business Insider on February 28, 2015, even though half of the brand’s global sales comes from the region, the challenge is now to hold on to the core luxury customer— even while encouraging the middle class to buy into the brand.Of course, it would be so much easier if the customer knew when to stop. Look at recent entrant Michael Kors. With great pricing, fabulous colours, it was on all our shopping lists at one time. Now we wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole. The brand has become so popular in Khan Market that it has completely lost its lustre. So much so that a stylist friend of mine insists it should be renamed Michael Kaur.The writer was editor-in-chief of ELLE India for 13 years (till Dec 2012), a role in which she influenced fashion and lifestyle"

The group recorded excellent results in Europe and the United States. The Louis Vuitton brand had an excellent performance on the back of renewed demand for its handbags. Wines and spirits underperformed as Chinese distributors continued to destock.

Wines and Spirits

Wines and Spirits increased by 12 per cent over the same quarter last year. However, 13% of the increase was due to currency movements. Organic growth declined by 1 percent mainly due to China’s policy on luxury items that has led to a massive decline in sales in Asia.

The decline in China was mostly mitigated by cognac sales and the United States, and increase in demand for Moet & Chandon champagne, Glenmorangie whiskey and Belvedere vodka.

Fashion and Leather Goods

This business line experienced an excellent quarter, increasing revenues by 13 per cent, as the Louis Vuitton brand displayed strong growth in its traditional lines and its new products. Other Brands that experienced increases in sales were Fendi, Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo and Berluti.

Perfumes and Cosmetics

Revenues from this business segment increased by 16 per cent in the first Quarter of 2015. Christian Dior continued the success of its iconic perfumes J’Adore and Miss Dior and the excellent performance of the make-up segment.

Other successful products in this segment this quarter were L’Homme Ideal by Guerlain, Fresh and Make Up For Ever.

Watches and Jewellery

This segment grew seven per cent organically is the first Quarter of 2015. Bvlgari’s jewelry line continues to perform well especially the new Lvcea watch for women. Hublot had a very good quarter while TAG Heuer is renovating its offering. During the Basel Watch Fair a partnership between TAG Heuer, Google and Intel with the intention to launch a Smartwatch was announced.

Selective Retailing

Sephora continued to gain market share across all regions, especially in North America and the Middle East. DFS faces growth constraints due to restrictions imposed in China. Overall this segment increased revenues by 20 per cent, which represents a five per cent organic revenue growth.

Outlook

These results are in line with our expected revenue growth targets. Given further weakness in the Euro, continued focus on cost control and a global increase in demand for luxury products, LVHM is positioned to outperform the market in 2015.
