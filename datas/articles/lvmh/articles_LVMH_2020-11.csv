LVMH Appoints Executive to Head Key Champagne Houses - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWFwcG9pbnRzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1oZWFkLWtleS0xMDAwNTcyODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has appointed Berta de Pablos-Barbier, an executive with experience across consumer goods and luxury, as chief executive officer of its Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon and Mercier Champagne houses, effective Jan. 1.

She succeeds Stéphane Baschiera, who will retire after a 24-year career in the wines and spirits division of LVMH, during which he spearheaded advertising campaigns featuring the likes of Roger Federer and Scarlett Johansson at Moët & Chandon, and oversaw the renovation of the brand’s historic seat, Château de Saran.

De Pablos-Barbier joins the French luxury group from confectionery giant Mars, where she held a number of positions since 2015, most recently chief growth officer. Before that, she was chief marketing officer at sportswear maker Lacoste and vice president, global marketing and communications, at jeweler Boucheron.

She takes on the job as Champagne sales have been sharply hit by the coronavirus pandemic. LVMH said sales were down 23 percent in volume terms in the first nine months of the year, although there were signs of a gradual recovery since June. De Pablos-Barbier will report to Philippe Schaus, ceo of Moët Hennessy, and will be a member of the Moët Hennessy executive committee.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and ceo of LVMH, paid tribute to Baschiera’s stewardship of some of the group’s key brands.

“He led with passion, rigor, efficiency and with a long-term vision for Champagne,” he said in a statement. “I also wish to warmly welcome Berta de Pablos-Barbier who will take over from Stéphane with the same respect for heritage and craftsmanship. I wish her great success in her new position.”

Schaus noted that de Pablos-Barbier had a background in agronomy, giving her a solid understanding of the world of winemaking, which is adapting to climate change and working to become more sustainable. LVMH has pledged to stop using herbicides in its Champagne vineyards by the end of this year.

“I trust that, together with her team, she will be instrumental in elevating the maisons of Moët & Chandon, Dom Perignon and Mercier to new levels,” Schaus said. “I wish to also recognize Stéphane Baschiera and his many accomplishments throughout a fine and long career at Moët Hennessy in France and Italy, including the leadership of several Champagne maisons.”

LVMH’s wines and spirits portfolio additionally includes the Champagne houses Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, Krug and Ruinart; wines such as Château d’Yquem, Château Cheval Blanc and Cloudy Bay; and spirits such as Hennessy cognac, Glenmorangie whiskey and Belvedere vodka."

To help fill the gap, the luxury giant is creating a “chief omnichannel officer” role at the group level, elevating Louis Vuitton vice president Michael David to the position, according to an internal announcement obtained by BoF.

Rogers, a former Apple Music executive who joined the group in 2015, is leaving his position to become chief experience officer at cryptocurrency start-up Ledger. He is set to maintain an advisory role at LVMH and will continue to host their innovation prize.

The shakeup comes as online luxury sales surge due to intermittent store closures since the coronavirus pandemic. For boutiques that remain open, online support features such as providing information about items’ availability, click-and-collect ordering and payments, or booking appointments to try on products have become key to driving traffic.

At LVMH, Rogers helped create an accelerator and prize for luxury and fashion tech start-ups and boosted the group’s efforts on data analysis and artificial intelligence. He also worked to coordinate online sales and marketing among the conglomerate’s more than 75 brands — a challenging brief at a company where brands have historically been given a long leash to pursue their own strategies.

LVMH has made headway in expanding the online offer at its brands, accelerating digital sales at powerhouse labels like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. But the group has largely remained on the sidelines of the multi-brand e-commerce race. An effort to launch an online luxury emporium division for the group during Rogers’ tenure, called 24S, has yet to gain traction in the highly competitive space.

“Ian has helped us integrate digital more deeply into our organisations with a sensitivity to the codes of luxury,” LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said.

“In a transplant such as this the body doesn’t always accept the organ, but with the mentorship of Toni Belloni and Alexandre Arnault, and a lot of patience and tolerance from the incredibly talented and experienced LVMH teams, I built a team of my own and we worked together toward digital transformation in luxury,” Rogers wrote in a Medium post.

E-commerce has grown to over 10 percent of total revenue since Rogers’ appointment, LVMH’s internal statement said. Future priorities are set to include accelerating brands’ migration to shared technology platforms, leveraging data and artificial intelligence, and “giving specific attention on the fast-moving ecosystem in China.”

The shakeup comes after LVMH remained largely quiet on its digital efforts while smaller rivals Richemont and the Pinault family office Artemis made headlines by joining forces with Farfetch and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, investing in a new joint venture in November.

24S will now come under the direction of Chris de Lapuente, the former Sephora chief executive who currently oversees that business in addition to LVMH’s perfume and cosmetics unit. His portfolio will be expanded to include LVMH’s entire Selective Retailing division, which includes 24S, airport retailer DFS, and Le Bon Marché.

The new omnichannel officer Michael David, currently global head of Louis Vuitton’s digital retail and client development, joined the brand’s Americas division in 2011. He’ll report to LVMH’s managing director Toni Belloni alongside Group IT director Franck Le Moal, who will absorb some of Rogers duties, including digital partnerships.

“We have solid digital foundations at LVMH but this journey is just beginning,” Belloni said.

LVMH Promotes Sephora Executive to CEO of Selective Retailing - WWD,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLWNocmlzLWRlLWxhcHVlbnRlLXNlbGVjdGl2ZS1yZXRhaWxpbmctY2VvLTEyMzQ2NjUzMDIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bulking up management in its selective retailing division, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Chris de Lapuente the branch’s chairman and chief executive officer, effective in January.

A rising star in the French luxury group, best known for leading Sephora to new heights over a 10-year tenure, de Lapuente expanded his purview in recent years to also oversee Le Bon Marché group, as well as some perfume and cosmetics activities.

LVMH had hinted in September that de Lapuente would take on additional responsibilities when Starbucks executive Martin Brok succeeded him at the management helm of Sephora.

De Lapuente’s scope will now also include DFS, Starboard & Onboard — which operates retail on cruise shops — and 24S, LVMH’s online fashion site. Benjamin Vuchot, the new chairman and ceo of DFS; Lisa Bauer, chairman and ceo of Starboard & Onboard, and Eric Goguey, chairman and ceo of 24S, will report to him.

De Lapuente also remains a member of LVMH’s executive committee. He reports to Antonio Belloni, group managing director.

“I am delighted to have Chris enlarge his responsibilities,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and ceo of LVMH, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD. “Since he joined the group some ten years ago, he has shown tremendous leadership and an exceptional ability to deliver excellent results and develop organizations.

“His most striking success has been Sephora, which he has been turned into a global leader in prestige beauty retailing, recognized around the world as one of the most innovative brands in products and services, both in-store and online. He has also achieved remarkable success in growing new beauty brands with great potential, notably Fenty Beauty,” Arnault added.

Under de Lapuente, sales and profits at Sephora tripled, and he bolstered its omnichannel presence.

Among his chief challenges in his new role will be DFS, hard hit by global travel disruptions from the pandemic. Organic sales in LVMH’s selective retailing division were down by 31 percent in the first nine months of the year to 7.18 billion euros.

While trumpeting “good resilience” at Sephora in reporting its third-quarter results last month, LVMH noted that “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel, which is showing no signs of improving.”

DFS’ two main markets were affected to varying degrees, with Hong Kong heavily hit while store closures in Macau lasted only two weeks in the first half. DFS has been increasing digital marketing efforts, including a partnership with WeChat.

In an interview on Monday, Belloni touted commonalities across LVMH’s selective retail activities: all multibrand platforms with a global footprint, and many with a good concentration of beauty products.

“Chris will be working on the future, in strategic opportunities that there are for distribution,” Belloni said, acknowledging that travel retail, along with hospitality, were the LVMH businesses most affected by the coronavirus crisis. “The companies that will win will be the ones that are adapting to be sure that they are desirable and responding to the customer needs of tomorrow.”

While the retailers under de Lapuente’s purview are different, they share “some critical elements of culture” and LVMH’s “economy of knowledge” flows freely between them, Belloni explained. This allows for a “cross pollination of learnings” and mobility of executives “so we can transfer the lessons that we learn in one place to the next one.”

He noted, for example, that Vuchot,soon arriving at the helm of DFS, comes from Sephora in Asia, where, under de Lapuente, he gained a keen understanding of the digital innovation need to meet the evolving expectations of consumers.

Before joining Sephora, de Lapuente worked at Procter & Gamble, starting in 1983. From 2007 to 2010, he held the position of group president for global hair care.

Tiffany & Co. Could Have a New Lease on Life in China - Jing Daily,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy90aWZmYW55LWNvLWNvdWxkLWhhdmUtYS1uZXctbGVhc2Utb24tbGlmZS1pbi1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just a few months ago, it looked like the American jewelry mainstay Tiffany & Co. could be in store for a tough end to what’s been an already very challenging year for luxury. The brand’s much-publicized acquisition by LVMH, first announced in late 2019, appeared to fall through in September when the French luxury group sought to break off the deal , kicking off a series of intense negotiations until LVMH ultimately said it would go ahead with the purchase at $131.50 per share. ($3.50 less than previously agreed, valuing the acquisition at $15.8 billion.)

For all of the drama that surrounded the deal, the motivations that drove LVMH to purchase Tiffany in the first place were driven in no small part by the Chinese market. The purchase would allow LVMH to beef up its impressive brand portfolio with a company favored by middle-class and younger consumers, while also expanding its accessible jewelry and timepiece offerings — giving it some competitive advantage against rival Richemont, which is more focused on hard luxury. As Nikkei Asia reported , “For LVMH, buying Tiffany would bolster its watches and jewelry segment, which now generates less than 10% of its total revenue — far less than the likes of the rival Richemont group, whose brands include Cartier.”

As 2020 comes to a close, Asia’s relatively strong consumer recovery — and China’s in particular — is seen as a major factor in LVMH’s decision to complete the deal. The timing of the acquisition couldn’t come at a better time for Tiffany, which is looking to cement its position inside China as its consumers are spending far more domestically with international travel sharply curtailed.

Following years of expansion in the market, both online and offline, what is most interesting about Tiffany’s latest moves in China is the brand’s decision to go all-in on Gen Z, perhaps with the understanding that the brand is already well-known by millennial and older shoppers. This summer, Tiffany announced that it had appointed 19-year-old actor and singer Jackson Yee as the brand ambassador for its Tiffany T collection, giving the brand new visibility among Yee’s vast young fanbase.

Whether it came down to the choice of Yee as a face of the brand, continued domestic shopping, good luck, or smart marketing, Tiffany has certainly fared well in China in recent months. This week, the company reported third- quarter net earnings of $119 million, up from $78.4 million in the same period one year ago, with sales reaching $1.01 billion, down a bit year-on-year but surpassing analysts’ estimates of $972.5 million.

According to Jing Daily, the contrast in Tiffany’s fortunes across markets was obvious, with comparable store sales in constant currency terms leaping 36% in the Asia Pacific region (minus Japan, which recorded a 5% decline), compared to a 14% drop in the Americas and 9% in Europe. As Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo noted, “Sales in mainland China continued to grow dramatically in the third quarter increasing by over 70%, with comparable sales nearly doubling in that period as compared to the prior year.”

The question now is whether a post-acquisition Tiffany can maintain this momentum into 2021. With Yee and all of his attention-drawing power , the brand has significant potential to leverage content-commerce strategies that can attract millennial and Gen Z shoppers.

But simply having Yee hawk the Tiffany T collection in ads and on his social media accounts won’t be enough. A young male celebrity arms race has been heating up all year, with Bulgari hiring content-commerce stalwart Kris Wu as brand ambassador and Cartier bringing on Hua Chenyu for a campaign earlier this year. As 2021 approaches, it will be interesting to see how Tiffany fits into the broader LVMH strategy for China, which, as CCI has previously noted , expertly weaves together multiple content-commerce strands."
LVMH's Failed Stake Building Effort Resurfaces in Enduring Hermès Family Investigation - The Fashion Law,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWhzLWZhaWxlZC1zdGFrZS1idWlsZGluZy1lZmZvcnQtcmVzdXJmYWNlcy1pbi1lbmR1cmluZy1oZXJtZXMtZmFtaWx5LWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ten years ago, on an otherwise ordinary day in October 2010, news broke that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault had built up a sizable stake in Hermès. The Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate revealed in a statement, as required by French finance law, that it had acquired a 14.2 percent stake in the then-173-year old Hermès, in which the Puech, Dumas and Guerrands families controlled a 73.4 percent stake. What would come to be revealed in due time was that LVMH’s revelation that day was only the first of several that could be expected, and despite the agreement among “the majority of the Hermès families that Arnault was an unwanted interloper” with no place at their ownership table, LVMH’s notoriously ruthless leader was undeterred.

In fact, within seventy-two hours of the October 23 announcement, Arnault had struck again. LVMH revealed – by way of a markedly short press release – that in addition to its previously-disclosed 14.2 percent stake in Hermès, a sudden conversion of cash equity swaps into shares upped its stake to “a total of 18,017,246 Hermès International shares.” The conglomerate now controlled 17.1 percent of Hermès, a stake acquired at what Reuters called “a major discount to recent market levels.”

Given that Arnault had reportedly “tried and failed to buy shares from Hermès family members” in the past, the making of LVMH’s new ownership was shrouded in mystery. “Nobody knows where LVMH bought the shares from or when,” a hedge fund manager told Reuters in late October 2010. Reuters noted at the same time, foreshadowing the impropriety that was afoot, “It was not clear how LVMH bought its holding at an average price of 80.5 euros, a 54 percent discount to Friday’s closing price of 176.2 euros.”

The question in the minds of the Hermès families, the company’s CEO Patrick Thomas, analysts, and curious laymen, alike, was this: how – exactly – had LVMH come to possess an otherwise undetected 17.1 percent stake in the publicly-traded but closely-held Hermès? It would not be long before it became clear that LVMH’s stake – which ended up climbing to a whopping 23.1 percent as of July 2013 – was the result of a handful of meticulously crafted deals.

Those deals would come under the microscope in rival lawsuits that Hermès and LVMH would file against one another in 2012; Hermès filed a criminal complaint against LVMH in a Paris court in July, accusing the luxury conglomerate of insider trading, collusion and manipulating stock prices. LVMH responded in September by filing a complaint of its own against Hermès for “blackmail, slander and unfair competition.” (Hermès would file an additional lawsuit against LVMH in June 2013, seeking the cancellation of equity swaps LVMH allegedly used to secretly acquire a minority stake, in connection with that it called “the largest fraud in the history of the French stock market.”).

All the while, the French financial services watchdog Autorité des marchés financiers (“AMF”) had been investigating LVMH’s investment in Hermès, launching an official probe in November 2010, and revealing in October 2012 that it had uncovered evidence of “wrongdoing” on LVMH’s part and asked the sanctions committee to decide whether to impose penalties on LVMH.

A year later, in July 2013, following hearings to determine whether there was insider trading and share price manipulation at play in LVMH’s acquisition of Hermès shares, and thus, whether LVMH should be fined, the AMF sanctions committee determined that LVMH had, in fact, secretly bought shares in rival Hermès to build a stake in the iconic Paris-based design house, and as a result, levied a $10.4 million fine on LVMH.

A Separate Fight

LVMH’s 23.1 percent stake, which was worth $7.5 billion at the time, would end up back out of the hands of Arnault. Following a legal back-and-forth before the Paris Commercial Court, Hermès and LVMH settled their dispute in the fall of 2014, with LVMH agreeing to distribute its Hermès stake to shareholders and institutional investors in December 2014, and vowing not to buy more shares in Hermès for the next five years.

Hermès chairman Axel Dumas and Arnault both expressed “their satisfaction that relations between the two groups, representatives of France’s savoir-faire, have now been restored,” LVMH asserted in a statement at the time, and although peace has seemingly remained between the two luxury titans since then, their high-profile scuffle has since returned to headlines thanks to a separate but closely related matter.

As it turns out, executives for LVMH and Hermès may have made peace that day in court in September 2014, but trouble was brewing behind the scenes for the Hermès families.

On the heels of LVMH distributing its Hermès stake in late 2014, Hermès – “sparked by tension in the family after LVMH’s 2010 surprise stake building,” per Bloomberg, filed a criminal complaint against Nicolas Puech, asserting that the great-great-grandson of Hermès founder Thierry Hermès, and cousin to former Hermès chairman Jean-Louis Dumas, had falsely disclosed that he still owned nearly 6 percent of the company’s stock.

The impetus for the until-recently-secret complaint that Hermès filed against Puech came about during the AMF’s investigation of LVMH’s disclosures of its Hermès holdings and the legality of Arnault’s use of derivatives to build his stake in a largely undected manner. In furtherance of that probe, the French authority discovered how LVMH was able to secret build up such a considerable stake in Hermès in 2010: Puech.

According to the AMF, the single largest Hermès family shareholder was responsible for more than half of the 17.1 percent stake that LVMH amassed that year. No small matter, without Puech’s shares, LVMH “would not have been able to set up the ‘equity swaps,” a complex and opaque financial arrangement that allowed LVMH to keep its stake hidden from Hermès,” Swiss publication Le Temps wrote in May 2013.

Puech, now 77, has vigorously denied the allegations, saying via a spokesman in September 2014 when he resigned from the company’s supervisory board, that he has never sold any of his long-held shares in Hermès to LVMH. More specifically, Puech maintained that the AMF’s claim that he sold 8.8 million shares to banks utilized by LVMH chairman and CEO Arnault for equity swaps was at odds with reality, which is that he has never owned more than 6 percent of the company’s capital.

Regulators ultimately asserted that their investigation into Mr. Puech’s holdings “ran into a roadblock with Mr. Puech, because of ‘an absence of satisfactory cooperation,’” the New York Times reported in 2013.

But while Puech’s strife with his family was made most obvious by way of the complaint, it actually dates further, to at least late 2010 when the majority of the 60 fifth-generation and sixth-generation relatives of the company’s founder decided to strategically pool 51 percent of their collective 73.4 percent stake into a new holding company to protect against takeover attempts like the one that Arnault was in the process of waging.

LVMH publicly denied at the time that it was entertaining ambitions to slowly gain control and take over Hermès, with LVMH’s then-Vice President Pierre Godé stating, “It would be folly on our part to hamper the success of this great brand. LVMH has no intention of aggressively taking control of Hermès.” Nonetheless, the Hermès “family decided to confirm its unity for the long-term by creating a family holding company,” the members of the newly-initiated H21 firm, which was valued at 12 billion euros upon formation. “This will benefit from preferred rights on the remaining stock owned directly by the family.”

Reflecting on the clever structural maneuver aimed at ensuring the family was given the first right to buy any shares that individual members may want to sell, Patrick Albaladejo, former executive vice president for strategic development and image and close adviser to Hermès CEO Patrick Thomas, stated, “It is a message to Bernard Arnault that it will be useless to pursue a takeover attempt because the family has relinquished its right to sell.”

Not all family members opted to put their shares in the newly-created “H21” pool, though. One key family member – Mr. Puech – wanted no part of it. He told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche in March 2011 that “tying up our shares in a holding company would … deprive the family shareholders of their individual power of control on the management of the company,” noting that “the freedom of each shareholder is the best way to guarantee our unity in the long run.”

More than that, Puech – who sat on the company’s supervisory board from May 2012 until he left in August 2014 – stated that he was not entirely opposed to an LVMH, Hermès partnership as long as it “is to the advantage of our company and the company maintains its free will.”

CEO Patrick Thomas asserted at the time that “Nicolas doesn’t plan to sell any shares, and if he did, he would sell them to the family.”

A Criminal Complaint

Amid the formation of H21 and the outward-facing appearance of a united Hermès family front, the uncertainty around Puech’s holdings simmered even as he maintained that he had not sold any off any of his shares to LVMH, a group that his family viewed as a “barbarian at the gilded gates,” as the New York Times so aptly characterized it back in 2014. Such inter-family conflict would come to a head shortly after LVMH and Hermès opted to settle their rival lawsuits in connection with Arnault’s failed takeover attempt.

Much to his “surprise,” on the heels of LVMH distributing its Hermès stake in late 2014, Hermès quietly filed a criminal complaint against Puech on the basis that he falsely disclosed – in 2013 and 2014 – that he still owned nearly 6 percent of the company’s stock. More than that, and given that “French investigators found that Puech had not owned nearly 6 percent of Hermès shares since 2012,” the company also alleges that Puech failed to observe a “legal obligation to publicly state that his shareholding had gone below 5 percent.”

Counsel for Puech still denies the allegations surrounding his ownership stake, asserting that his client’s 5.8 percent stake – a total of 6,082,615 Hermès shares – remains unchanged. (Puech stopped disclosing his exact Hermès holding in late 2015, Bloomberg reports. But if he does, in fact, still have the entire 5.7 percent take, it is now worth approximately $6 billion).

Puech’s wealth manager, Eric Freymond – who is suspected to have “played a role in the 77-year-old Puech’s share disclosures for 2013 and 2014,” per Bloomberg – is also at the center of the French investigation, which is reportedly nearing completion. “According to the top court ruling, investigators suspect that the wealth manager acted ‘in an intentionally deceitful manner,’ and provided false data [to Puech] that led to the sworn statements.”

Freymond’s counsel says his client “fully contests” the allegations, and calls the case, itself, “poorly extinguished embers of an old fire.”

As for his current relations to the family business, Puech stepped down from the supervisory board in August 2014 after taking an increasingly backseat role. Bloomberg notes that while Puech joined the board in 2012 and attended each meeting that year,” his appearances become fewer in 2013 when “he attended less than a third of [the meetings], the fewest among members, and didn’t attend any the following year after resigning from his position in August.”

Reportedly sending a letter to Hermès and to the AMF to inform them of this resignation on August 18, 2014, Puech stated that “he has felt for several years beleaguered by members of his family, who have attacked him on several fronts.”

In terms of the since-settled scuffle between Hermès and LVMH, a rep for Puech revealed in September 2014 that while he is “happy that the dispute has ended, Mr. Puech never considered Bernard Arnault’s investment was a serious threat to the company.”"
LVMH Names Chief Omnichannel Officer - Yahoo Life,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbHZtaC1uYW1lcy1jaGllZi1vbW5pY2hhbm5lbC1vZmZpY2VyLTA1MDEwNjI5OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moving on to a new phase of its digital transformation, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has tapped two seasoned executives from its flagship fashion brand to lead the charge.

Michael David, currently vice president, client development and digital at Louis Vuitton, is to become chief omnichannel officer for the LVMH group, effective Jan. 20.

Meanwhile, Franck Le Moal will oversee the digital partnerships team in addition to his role as group IT director. Le Moal moved up to the group level in October 2019 after almost 20 years as chief information officer at Vuitton.

The reorganization comes as Ian Rogers, LVMH’s chief digital officer since 2015, transitions into an advisory role at LVMH and takes on a full-time job at tech start-up Ledger in Paris.

“We are very grateful for Ian’s contribution and look forward to continuing to work with him in his advisory role, including hosting the LVMH Innovation Award,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD. “Ian has helped us integrate digital more deeply into our organizations with a sensitivity to the codes of luxury.”

“Michael has led omnichannel at Louis Vuitton to become state of the art in the luxury industry both in terms of revenue growth and excellence of service to customers,” added Toni Belloni, group managing director at LVMH, who oversaw the reorganization of the digital and IT teams. “I am excited for Michael to bring these skills and knowledge to the LVMH digital team and look forward to working with him and Franck to accelerate progress across all the categories and maisons. We have solid digital foundations at LVMH, but this journey is just beginning.”

In an interview on Monday, Belloni recalled that Rogers, who came on board from Apple in 2015, said at the outset that his job was “bound to disappear” once digital know-how became embedded in all parts of LVMH and all functions.

“He has been great at spreading the gospel among our people, and among our leaders, most of them digital non-natives, and also attracting great talent to the group,” Belloni said, also crediting Rogers for “building a web of relationships for the group” with tech giants such as Google, Tencent and Salesforce, along with start-ups like the VivaTech forum in Paris.

“We are happy that he has accepted to stay on as an adviser,” he said. “We’ll be happy to count on his visionary thinking and the fact that he has a very high-level view of what’s happening in the system.”

Meanwhile, the new organizational structure — centered on omnichannel and data — will be charged with “making sure that each brand will have a high-quality, state-of-the-art omnichannel approach,” Belloni said.

He noted that physical stores remain “at the core of our distribution system” alongside each brand having a digital side, including direct-to-consumer touch points and an “infrastructure of remote customer service of high quality.”

Another mission of David’s will be to leverage data, aggregating it and employing artificial intelligence “so that we can delight the customers even more with more personalized curation and service,” Belloni said, while highlighting the importance of client confidentiality.

“Converging to a common technological framework and solutions” is yet another mission. “And there will be a push for innovation where the central organization, which we are calling omnichannel, will continue to work with key maisons to explore projects for smarter clienteling, a hybrid form of commerce, and we’re talking about the use of data for faster, last-mile delivery,” he added.

While Rogers was the public face of its digital ambitions, Belloni said LVMH now has about 50 people in digital working at the group level, another 50 or more within the group level’s “technical infrastructure” and about 600 more at the brands.

“In the end, we want the central group to act as a catalyst, but the maisons need to have their own solutions,” he said.

The goal is to “make sure that we bring the level of desirability and differentiation of our maisons in the virtual world to the same level to what we have built for decades and decades in the physical world. The word ominichannel is not casual — we really believe the two things go together,” Belloni stressed.

Rogers revealed his exit from LVMH in a blog post and podcast Monday morning, noting he will become chief experience officer at Ledger, which protects digital assets such as cryptocurrency.

He is to oversee the “b-to-c business at Ledger including product, marketing and sales. Our job is to make sure Ledger products are not only secure but also easy to use. We also want to educate and help raise the tide to float all boats in the cryptocurrency movement.”

Founded in 2014, Ledger set out to create “secure solutions for blockchain applications” and now has more than 130 employees in Paris, Vierzon, France and San Francisco, according to its web site. It has sold more than 1.5 million digital wallets for cryptocurrencies.

An exuberant executive known to arrive at business meetings on a skateboard wearing the latest hard-to-get Vetements sweatshirt, Rogers joined LVMH in September 2015 from Apple, where he briefly headed up the launch of Apple Music. His mission was to explore new opportunities for the luxury giant in the digital sphere.

Before Apple Music, he was ceo of Beats Music, a maker of high-end headphones, and ceo of Topspin Media. Prior to that, he founded Mediacode, which was purchased by Yahoo, where he became vice president and general manager of music. Rogers has also served as a web master for Nullsoft and Beastie Boys.

Recapping his accomplishments in his blog post, Rogers said the “luxury business itself hasn’t changed, but the ways we create awareness and sell are changing dramatically, so at LVMH we have made many adaptations.”

“When I joined LVMH, there was disagreement on strategies regarding online distribution which have since been rationalized, agreed upon, and are being executed. We have started to build a practice around data and artificial intelligence, which I believe will drive customer satisfaction, reduce waste and drive sales in the coming years,” he added.

LVMH has grown e-commerce to account for about 15 percent of revenues, with selective distribution and perfumes and cosmetics division more than 20 percent, according to Belloni.

Under the new digital organization, David and Le Moal report to Belloni; the digital team and the customer care organization to David; Olivier Le Garlantezec and the partnerships team to Le Moal. Wendy Chan, head of digital in Asia-Pacific, will add local media oversight to her scope and report to David, LVMH noted.

"LVMH Names Chris de Lapuente Chairman, CEO of Selective Retailing - Yahoo Finance","Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLW5hbWVzLWNocmlzLWxhcHVlbnRlLWNoYWlybWFuLTExMDAwODk2MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bulking up management in its selective retailing division, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Chris de Lapuente the branch’s chairman and chief executive officer, effective in January 2021.

A rising star in the French luxury group, best known for leading Sephora to new heights over a 10-year tenure, de Lapuente expanded his purview in recent years to also oversee Le Bon Marché group, as well as some perfume and cosmetics activities.

More from WWD

LVMH had hinted in September that de Lapuente would take on additional responsibilities when Starbucks executive Martin Brok succeeded him at the management helm of Sephora.

De Lapuente’s scope will now also include DFS, Starboard & Onboard and 24S, LVMH’s online fashion site. Benjamin Vuchot, the new chairman and ceo of DFS; Lisa Bauer, chairman and ceo of Starboard & Onboard, and Eric Goguey, chairman and ceo of 24S, will report to him.

De Lapuente also remains a member of LVMH’s executive committee.

“I am delighted to have Chris enlarge his responsibilities,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and ceo of LVMH, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD. “Since he joined the group some ten years ago, he has shown tremendous leadership and an exceptional ability to deliver excellent results and develop organizations.

“His most striking success has been Sephora, which he has been turned into a global leader in prestige beauty retailing, recognized around the world as one of the most innovative brands in products and services, both in-store and online. He has also achieved remarkable success in growing new beauty brands with great potential, notably Fenty Beauty,” Arnault added.

Under de Lapuente, sales and profits at Sephora tripled, and bolstered its omnichannel presence.

Among his chief challenges in his new role will be DFS, hard hit by global travel disruptions from the pandemic. Organic sales in LVMH’s selective retailing division were down by 31 percent in the first nine months of the year to 7.18 billion euros.

Story continues

While trumpeting “good resilience” at Sephora in reporting its third-quarter results last month, LVMH noted that “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel, which is showing no signs of improving.”

DFS’ two main markets were affected to varying degrees, with Hong Kong heavily hit while store closures in Macau lasted only two weeks in the first half. DFS has been increasing digital marketing efforts, including a partnership with WeChat.

"Fendi, LVMH Top Brass Discuss Ingrained Sustainability - WWD","Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWZlYXR1cmVzL2ZlbmRpLWx2bWgtdG9wLWJyYXNzLWRpc2N1c3MtaW5ncmFpbmVkLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LTEyMzQ2NTY2MDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Sustainability needs to be ingrained in a company — there is no room for improvisation.

That’s a belief shared by Antoine Arnault, head of image, communications and environment at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton; Silvia Venturini Fendi, and Serge Brunschwig, chairman and chief executive officer of Fendi, who spoke to WWD in advance of the brand’s unveiling on Friday of a new section of its web site dedicated and committing to social responsibility and environmental sustainability.

Linked to the latter, a few days earlier Brunschwig had planted a Turkey oak, symbolizing dignity and courage, at the construction site of a new Fendi factory in Tuscany’s Bagno a Ripoli, outside Florence, which is expected to open in July 2022. It will allow the Rome-based company to further develop and produce its leather goods category, and serve as a training center.

“We wanted to give back to Tuscany one of its beautiful Chianti landscapes, renovating an old building rather than leaving something abandoned and dirty — the architects say we are remaking a hill. We are very proud of this,” said Brunschwig. The plant will allow Fendi to grow its capacity and, in addition to the 150 employees working in an existing factory, the company will progressively hire 300 to 350 new workers in two to three years.

Located on a surface area of eight hectares, and covering a 140,400-square-foot space designed by Milan-based architecture firm Piuarch, the building previously housed the Fornace Brunelleschi kiln. Works started in the area in August 2018 to clear and prepare the construction site.

Both the perimeter and interior walls will be made of glass and the courtyards will be enhanced by local varieties of plants and flowers. Fendi is aiming for the factory to achieve the LEED Platinum certification. A series of buildings connected with squares and stairs and located at different levels will be integrated into the Tuscan hillside. In addition, Fendi has conceived a public park in the same area, opposite the kindergarten, featuring playgrounds and following the same approach of biodiversity of the factory’s landscape.

“It’s wonderful, I am so happy,” enthused Venturini Fendi. “We are growing despite these difficult moments [connected to the COVID-19 pandemic]. There are growth prospects, and at the center of it all is our Made in Italy.”

“The heart of a company is the factory, and it’s always an emotion for me when I go to a factory. I know this will be a place integrated with the landscape, where people will be able to work in harmony. There will be a lot of glass and so much light, you’ll be able to see the hills outside, it’s very poetic. There will be an osmosis between the inside and the outside.”

She also said she was happy the factory would help repurpose an old building. “There is no need to build more.”

Addressing the new web site, Arnault said that at every LVMH house, the “new mind-set for every manager and management team is to put sustainability on top of a priority list. In the past few years the way of thinking has shifted and it’s now unthinkable for sustainability not to be factored in, whatever the project. We see it in building a new factory like this, and in the way most designers integrate this in their work. Eco design is becoming a top priority. From the cradle of the idea to the grave of the product, recycling and making new with old, sustainability is becoming inherent in the way we do our business, and we take pride in this because it’s not new for us.”

He credited his father Bernard Arnault’s initiative in 1992 to create a sustainability department “when the topic was not à la mode, and because it’s been rooted in the group for so long and infused in its values, now we are able to see everything with this in mind. We cannot decide one day to become green or eco-friendly on these topics, you need to have it in your roots to be real and more and more it feels natural.”

Brunschwig echoed this and said that Fendi realizes that transparency is increasingly important in this area. Accordingly, the company is pledging to “shed all possible and available information on activities and results on three axes: supply chain, environment measures and community.”

The most modern way to approach sustainability is “to talk to everybody, to communities, employees and clients, everyone is motivated by these subjects.”

“We acknowledge we are not perfect,” underscored Arnault. “We are absolutely conscious that with the scale of our group, with tens of thousands of suppliers, we cannot be absolutely perfect, we tend to be clear and not to pretend that we are absolutely irreproachable. We show good faith through transparency, asking people inside or outside that if they see anything out of the ordinary or not on the right track to alert us. This is one way to improve.”

Brunschwig touted the quality of Fendi’s sourcing and its commitment to employ increasingly more natural materials, such as BCI cotton. The second step will be the use of entirely organic cotton, he said. To wit, along with employing cellulose-based fibers for lining and packaging, among its different initiatives Fendi is also introducing the FF Green Interlace capsule collection, an evolution of the leather design introduced for spring 2020. The FF jacquard canvas will also be made with the same formula. Fendi’s Peekaboo and Baguette bags will be available in certified FF cotton and recycled polyester, with the Interlace technique. The fabric is cut into individual strips, which are then assembled, and hand knotted together. The knots are then folded on the opposite side and the bag is finished with a maxi metal needle.

“I wanted this to be as natural as possible,” said Venturini Fendi. “This is all genuine, not a marketing ploy, because it’s very serious, starting from the foundations. There is a lot of work behind it, and a change in mentality.”

Sustainability also means supporting the community and Venturini Fendi and Brunschwig have been endorsing Fendi’s “hand in hand” project. Selected artisans, one in each Italian region, were asked to offer a unique interpretation of the Baguette, collaborating with the brand’s own artisans. Venturini Fendi enthused about the potential of the project, which helps preserve and transmit unique craftsmanship not only from generation to generation but around the world. The first designs derived from the project were shown during Fendi’s spring 2021 show last month.

Fendi has also long committed to the education and training of young talents through the Massoli Academy in Rome, which trains new tailors, and the participation in the LVMH Institute des Métiers d’Excellence training program.

“This is a great example of how practices can be shared between companies [under the LVMH umbrella],” said Arnault. He conceded that brands that are part of the group compete with one another, “except on these topics, they understand that in this case we need to share and be altruistic. Brands fight for locations, designers and employees, it’s a healthy consequence of decentralization; however, we mutualize our strength on important topics and Serge and Fendi do it well and I say it with great pride.”

Arnault continued by saying that LVMH needs training programs such as the Institute des Métiers d’Excellence. “Without shame, I can say that we could not continue our business without properly trained programs and they are directly linked to the success of our business. This is the right thing to do and robotization is not even in our mind. Italians should collectively be aware of and recognize more their treasures, and ensure they survive.”

Helping communities also meant that Fendi has supported storied glass company Mazzucato from Murano, Italy, whose business was hurt by the pandemic, by acquiring and disassembling 37 of its chandeliers to create new decorations for Fendi’s Christmas windows in cities such as Rome, Shanghai, Paris, London and New York. The decorations will be crafted from 49,340 square meters of leather waste coming from Fendi production plants together with sugarcane-derived foam obtained through processes using recycled and regenerated products.

Furs — a core and storied business for Fendi — may not be seen as sustainable by some, so asked to comment on this, Brunschwig said that “for Fendi, fur is a sustainable material, there is no question about it. Of course, the survival of the species and the well-being of animals is very important, there are certifications. We buy from farms that have the highest standards and we improve as we speak.”

Arnault was open to discuss this. “It is very important to tell the truth and this is a sensitive topic. Of course, we’ll do everything we need to do to be even more compliant to the [already] highest standards of certification. However, we should not be naïve. It’s not that if a group like ours stops to make fur people will stop to buy fur and I much prefer to sell fur to those clients but fur done in the right way. I won’t lie, yes, [the animals] die, but they are treated with the respect and humanity they deserve and with the standards that we put in this work — it cannot be done better. I’d rather be the bad guy and to sell it to the customers when done the right way than to let others do it in horrible conditions and do their business like that. I know it’s a difficult statement to hear but I am ready to take the consequences.”

Brunschwig also touted Fendi’s added value of craftsmanship in the development of the brand’s fur designs, and “giving customers the freedom to choose.”

The executive said the new web site will continue to update information and progress on sustainability, but Arnault pointed out that the group and its brands focus on “short-term goals, contrary to a lot of our friends and competitors whose claims and objectives are set for 2050 — far enough for the goals never to be seen and if they are not reached nobody will remember them. We want realistic and measurable goals, so that progress can be verified. I am not a fan of incantation and setting unrealistic, far away goals. I much prefer that people can come and point their fingers at us if we have not achieved our goals.”

Arnault said the group has received “a lot of help” from LVMH special adviser Stella McCartney. “She is our little red demon or blue angel, almost every day she has hints, ideas and suggestions and makes us meet the right people. It is very enriching because she is so knowledgeable about this topic.”

“The beauty of it is that everybody is interested in sustainability, it’s everybody’s problem,” said Brunschwig. “Customers ask more about how and where the product was made than its price,” said Arnault."
EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Names Anne de Vergeron Repossi CEO - Yahoo Life,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWx2bWgtbmFtZXMtYW5uZS12ZXJnZXJvbi0wNTEwNTI0MzcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Anne de Vergeron chief executive officer of Repossi, tapping a board member of the Place Vendôme jeweler with a strong background in finance to steer it into the future.

Formerly an investment banker, de Vergeron worked at UBS for 16 years before joining LVMH in business development at the group level, serving as director of the activity. She led LVMH’s acquisition of an initial, minority stake in Repossi in 2015 and has served as a board member since the transaction. The executive, who graduated from French business school ESCP, was also involved in the group’s purchase of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, and served on the board of the high-end perfurmer.

“Honestly, it’s extremely natural as a transition, if you love the products and the brands and you like storytelling, I would say it’s extremely natural,” said de Vergeron, when asked about the move from finance to a luxury group and now, taking up the reins of a high-end label herself. As a board member, the executive has gained insight into the creation side of the jewelry house, and knows the house’s creative director, Gaia Repossi, well.

“I have a great admiration and respect for Gaia’s work but also her bold vision and her eye, and we work very well together,” she said.

“I’d like to think of ourselves as the dynamic duo,” she added.

Speaking on a Zoom call, she noted the challenge of balancing her personal view on the jewelry designer’s work while also wanting the designer to fully express herself.

“It’s a lot of dialogue, I would say, a lot of influence, a lot of understanding, a lot of admiration, and sometimes you have to tell her ‘Listen, maybe you should do it another way,’” said de Vergeron, noting she has guided the designer in the codes of corporate culture.

While the process involves respecting creation, sometimes it’s about making sure that if a diamond is on a ring, that it is visible, and not hidden, she observed.

“We’re one of the very few houses with a real creative director in jewelry — she’s Gaia Repossi, she’s got her name on the front of the door,” she said, noting that Repossi is the the house’s third generation of designers.

Stressing the designer’s influence on the jewelry world, de Vergeron ticked off some examples, including suspended diamonds and wearing rings close to fingertips.

“Ear cuffs — every brand on the market is doing ear cuffs,” she said, pointing out other Place Vendôme jewelers that have done the same.

“She has been creating a lot of codes in jewelry and it’s true, lots of brands are looking at what she’s doing and try to replicate it,” added de Vergeron.

Noting Gaia Repossi’s close ties with the art world, de Vergeron said the label plans to do more artistic collaborations. The designer recently teamed with Flavin Judd of the Donald Judd Foundation for the refurbishment of the label’s historic store in Monaco. Judd outfitted the store in raw wood, using texture, colors and geometry to delineate separate spaces — an altogether different approach to modernity than the label’s futuristic Place Vendôme flagship, designed by Rem Koolhaas, with shiny, metallic surfaces.

The brand supported the current Donald Judd retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, its first major arts sponsorship.

“Artistic dialogue is the way to establish this already existing relationship that Gaia has been building with different artists. We just want to formalize something that already exists and it’s really true to the work of Gaia,” said de Vergeron, hinting at further partnerships with the art world in the near future.

Asked what she sees as the biggest challenges for the discrete, avant-garde jewelry house with nearly 65 years of history, she said they hope to strike the right balance.

“Our goal is to find the right balance by expanding the brand identity and maintaining a coherent message on who we are, what we stand for, where we come from while continuing our artistic dialogues,” she said.

“It really belongs to Place Vendôme,” added the executive, noting that high jewelry is the label’s starting point, and that every piece is hand crafted.

As for distribution, the label is launching e-commerce early next year, initially in Europe, followed by a global rollout.

The label has just released its new collection of Berbère Chromatic rings, which come in wide bands of pink gold and lacquer — in a nude pink, red and a dark navy.

Top dog from LVMH joins French crypto startup Ledger - Sifted,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2xlZGdlci1pYW4tcm9nZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world of cryptocurrencies isn’t only winning over new investors, it has also just wooed a star executive whose CV includes high-profile companies like LVMH and Apple.

French crypto startup Ledger is hiring Ian Rogers, the former chief digital officer of luxury group LVMH and head of Apple’s music streaming business.

As chief experience officer, Rogers will lead thinking about user experience and how to improve Ledger’s hardware wallets that are built for safely storing crypto keys.

Rogers said in a statement on Monday he’s excited to join Ledger at a time of deep technological transformation for digital currencies, “when science fiction becomes mainstream”.

“Digital assets are at the dawn of such an evolution,” Rogers said. “We’re at an inevitable and exciting period of transformation.”

His career shift, from the more glamorous industries of luxury goods and blockbuster consumer brand Apple, shows cryptocurrencies being taken more seriously by mainstream execs..

A screenshot from Ian Rogers' Twitter account, as he leaves LVMH to join French startup Ledger.

Bitcoin rally

Rogers’ hire comes during a year when Bitcoin, the most prominent cryptocurrency, has had a record-breaking rally.

The performance has broadened the pool of crypto investors, and for companies like Ledger which sell crypto-related technology, it can be a driver for demand.

“Estimates show there are about 20m to 30m Bitcoin owners globally, and that’s expected to grow by about 150m during the next bull run,” Ledger chief executive Pascal Gauthier told Sifted in an interview earlier this year. “We could potentially sell 10 times the number of keys we’ve sold so far — there’s huge potential.”

One of Ledger’s best-sellers is a €119 gadget that looks like a USB key, and actually serves as a physical vault for storing crypto passwords on a secure chip. It helps shield Bitcoin and other crypto from theft by hackers.

The Paris-based startup has sold more than 2m crypto keys, and has been diversifying by targeting corporates with a software offering called Vault.

Europe’s opportunity

For Gauthier, who took over as chief executive in 2019, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are one of the areas of tech where Europe can shine.

Gauthier was one of Ledger’s early financiers from 2015, after a career in the French technology sector. He spent several years at Kelkoo, a France-born online price comparison platform, before joining ad-targeting company Criteo and helping prepare it for its Nasdaq stock market listing in 2013.

He says secure electronic crypto wallets are one opportunity to leverage French and European hardware know-how.

French-born companies like Gemalto, STMicroelectronics and Morpho have helped spawn a pool of expertise in payments, cybersecurity and identity management, as well as electronics, says Gauthier. The US, meanwhile, has focused almost exclusively on software development, he says.

“When I joined Ledger I was tired of fighting for crumbs on markets dominated by American players,” says Gauthier. “I was looking for an idea that had the potential to become the next Google or Apple — and this is it.”"

In 2012, LVMH — the world's largest luxury-goods conglomerate, with 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Dom Pérignon, and Sephora — conducted a survey of its employees across North America.

One finding was concerning. Employees reported that they weren't sure the organization prioritized diversity and inclusion in human resources or in its overall business strategy.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Business Insider

And yet: LVMH's leadership team had already been working on several programs around diversity and inclusion, including a 2007 initiative, called EllesVMH, to increase the representation of women in senior leadership.

This, to Gena Smith, was a clue.

""We said, right away, we know that we need to be more communicative,"" the company's senior vice president of human resources and head of global and executive recruitment told Business Insider.

""We need to share with people what we're doing,"" said Smith, who joined LVMH nearly 10 years ago.

But retooling talent management and workplace culture at centuries-old brands is, to the say the least, a challenge.

Business savvy and a long-term perspective make an effective diversity-and-inclusion leader

The business-to-business software company ZoomInfo estimates there's been a 113% increase in executives with D&I titles since 2015, Business Insider's Marguerite Ward reported in July — but every organization is looking for a unique skill set.

In September, LVMH — which has a market capitalization of $286 billion and generated $59 billion in revenue in 2019 — hired its first head of diversity and inclusion for North America, Corey Smith, who had previously led the same function at Major League Baseball. Gena Smith, who steered the search, told Business Insider she was impressed by his willingness to focus on what LVMH could achieve in the long term and by how he saw D&I as part of the company's overall business strategy.

Perhaps most important, Corey Smith indicated he wouldn't grow impatient if it took a while to see the results of new programs. LVMH, after all, has roots in the 16th century. Overhauling outdated systems won't happen overnight.

""I wouldn't want someone to come in and be frustrated because we're talking about, 'What are we going to build over 10 years?'"" Gena Smith said. ""We want to have actions and successes in the short term, but we have the ability to build something really impactful over the long period.""

Related stories

In a statement to WWD, Corey Smith said he looked forward to building ""on the foundation they have in place in order to ensure that the group continues to be an inclusive, forward-thinking, and desirable place to work and that we can use the power of our brands to effect change.""

The way Cassi Pittman Claytor, an assistant professor of sociology at Case Western University, sees it, cultivating a diverse workforce and customer base is more important than ever.

""It's not even a matter of addressing your own organizational issues,"" she said, noting that much of Generation Z is nonwhite. ""It's about being prepared for the future,"" she added, ""the future workers and the future consumer.""

Racial inequity persists in the retail industry

Diversity data for the luxury industry is generally hard to come by because many companies keep that information private. Recently, that's started to change.

Over the summer, Sharon Chuter (a former LVMH employee) launched the Pull up for Change campaign to encourage beauty brands to be more transparent about diversity within their organizations. Sephora, an LVMH brand, disclosed that its leadership was 6% Black. In June, WWD released an article that found LVMH did not have a single nonwhite executive in its C-suite or on its board.

When Business Insider followed up about those stats, LVMH said in a statement that the company's priority was to create ""an inclusive and desirable place to work"" for all employees regardless of background. The statement went on, saying ""the commitment to creating opportunity and supporting a diverse workforce is an integral component of the LVMH vision."" It also pointed to the hiring of Corey Smith as someone who would build on current programs and push equity through the organization.

Lack of diversity is a long-running issue in the retail world.

For example, a 2015 report by the liberal think tank Demos and the NAACP found that Black and Latino retail workers were typically funneled into lower-paying roles like cashiers. According to the report, some 88% of retail managers were white, compared with 5% Asian, 6% Black, and 8% Latino (the report said the percentages didn't add up to 100 because multiple racial groups contained workers who identified as Hispanic).

Nonwhite consumers, meanwhile, are often ignored or treated with suspicion in high-end stores.

Addressing these problems isn't just a matter of holding a diversity training day, said Pittman Claytor, whose research focuses on middle-class Black people. She's working with Sephora for a study on racial bias in retail environments.

D&I ""needs to be part of a larger, systemic approach,"" Pittman Claytor said.

Rebooting in progress

For LVMH, Gena Smith said success in DEI required ""constant measurement."" When LVMH set a goal of increasing the number of female leaders, for example, the company kept careful records of who was hired and promoted each year.

In the past few years, LVMH has broadened its focus from gender equity to all forms of diversity and inclusion, Smith said. In North America, 64% of LVMH employees identify as nonwhite and 12% identify as Black. Women make up 45% of LVMH's leadership team.

New processes have been introduced: To encourage employee participation in D&I initiatives, LVMH posts an annual callout for ideas. The staff members with the most compelling submissions work with mentors to incubate those ideas and, eventually, deploy them in the company. LVMH has hosted ""listening sessions,"" including a panel discussion in which women at the company described obstacles they'd encountered in their careers.

LVMH also partners with the nonprofit Runway of Dreams to create space for people with disabilities in the luxury industry. And leadership is working with historically Black colleges and universities to identify talent that isn't typically tapped for careers in the luxury market.

Beyond raw data, progress happens when all employees prioritize D&I in their own job responsibilities, whether they're a sales associate or a manager at corporate headquarters. Smith said the goal was ""embedding that in the culture of the organization and the way we work."""
How Tiffany and LVMH Kissed and Made Up - JCK,"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvdGlmZmFueS1sdm1oLWtpc3MtbWFrZS11cC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When LVMH first approached Tiffany & Co. about a takeover in 2019, it was with an initial price of $120 a share. That was turned down. Eventually, the two sides arrived at a final price of $135 a price.

Or, at least Tiffany believed that was the final price. Soon, the two parties were back at the negotiating table, after LVMH developed—or pretended to develop—a case of cold feet. In the second round of negotiations, LVMH’s initial offer was…$120 a share.

These and other details were revealed in the proxy statement Tiffany filed on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking shareholders to approve the new takeover deal, which came out to $131.50 a share.

The filing also revealed that Tiffany received three overtures from prospective suitors during the period when it looked like the deal was falling apart: one from an undisclosed party, one from an undisclosed company, and the third from a “wealthy family.” Law firm Sullivan & Cromwell deemed all the inquiries to be not credible.

After the parties declared legal war on each other, most observers—as well as Tiffany’s complaint—said that LVMH’s last-minute brinksmanship was simply a pretext to buy the company at a lower price. LVMH denied this; renegotiating the deal “never crossed our mind,” declared an LVMH exec. But that’s exactly what ended up happening.

On Sept. 16, as the companies’ lawyers were filing cross-claims in the Delaware Court of Chancery, an individual close to LVMH contacted Tiffany’s financial advisor, Centerview Partners, about a settlement. This person was told that Tiffany felt confident in its legal position.

On Oct. 2, after a trial date had been set for January, the person close to LVMH contacted Centerview again and offered to buy the company at $120 a share.

That offer was again spurned. Yet, in a strange retread of last year’s negotiations, the price was raised to the mid-$120s, and then the high $120s.

After consulting its chairman, Roger Farah, Tiffany said it would only agree to a price reduction if it could continue paying its regular quarterly dividend. It also wanted an “‘airtight” contract that “did not include any closing conditions that would excuse [LVMH] from consummating the merger.”

LVMH offered $130 a share, then $131. The two sides finally shook hands on a $131.50 final price—about 3 percent less than the original agreed-to price—in a deal that allowed Tiffany to continue to pay its dividend.

The final deal is meant to preclude LVMH from wriggling out again, or launching a third round of negotiations. Of course, in an earlier legal filing, Tiffany’s lawyers maintained that the original deal was written with “ample protections for shareholders,” given LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s reputation for hardball tactics. Which didn’t prevent the original deal from nearly getting junked.

It would be hard to imagine the luxury giant trying to pull out again, but this saga has already proved full of surprises."
"LVMH Chair Arnault Regains Second ""Richest"" Title, Adding $16 Billion to Net Worth Over Past 2 Weeks - The Fashion Law","Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1yZWdhaW5zLXNlY29uZC1yaWNoZXN0LXRpdGxlLWFkZGluZy0xNi1iaWxsaW9uLXRvLW5ldC13b3J0aC1vdmVyLXBhc3QtMi13ZWVrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After nabbing second place on the list of the world’s richest in July 2019, ever-so-briefly ousting Amazon’s Jeff Bezos from the top spot a few months later in December, and then falling quite a bit in 2020, as COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the luxury sector, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault has regained his title as the second richest person in the world by Forbes’ estimations, with a net worth of more than $137 billion, thanks to a rally in the share price of the Euronext-traded LVMH.

71-year old Arnault, who is sitting in the number 3 spot on Bloomberg’s “richest” list, which puts his worth at $103 billion, added $7 billion to his wealth on Monday, alone, “as European stocks and luxury companies soared on the back of the Covid-19 vaccine news from Pfizer,” according to CNBC, having “added about $16 billion to his wealth over the past two weeks – more than entire purchase price of jewelry giant Tiffany,” which LVMH finally agreed to acquire for $15.8 billion, following a legal scuffle with Tiffany & Co. over the pricing of the deal.

CNBC notes that regardless of the ranking, with Forbes and Bloomberg utilizing different methodologies for gauging net worth, both lists “show that the stock market boom of the past two weeks has created vast wealth for the world’s billionaires.” That same surge has upped the number of “centibillionaires” – i.e., those with a fortune of at least $100 billion – to five, up from the three – Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Bernard Arnault – that were members of what Bloomberg calls “the world’s most exclusive wealth club,” as of June 2019.

The recent rebound comes after Arnault’s net worth fell significantly as a result of the onset of COVID-19 and the enduring impact that it is having on the upscale segment of the retail market. Shares in Paris-based LVMH – which holds the title of the largest luxury goods conglomerate in the world in connection with its roster of upwards of 70 luxury brands, from Louis Vuitton, Celine, Givenchy, and Dior to Moet & Chandon, Dom Perignon, and Veuve Clicquot, among others – fell significantly in light of the global health pandemic, as sales and profit margins for the group diminished due to the temporary shuttering of stores across the globe and the widespread pattern of consumers shunning luxury purchases and travel.

As of August, Arnault’s net worth had plunged by $25.1 billion thus far for the year to $80.2 billion, making him “the biggest loser among the world’s 500 richest people.”

Since the earliest months of the pandemic, Chinese demand has rebounded, helping to rebuild the bottom lines of luxury goods entities, such as LVMH and rival French conglomerate Kering, both of which “reported mid-double digit sales growth in China for the second quarter,” per Bloomberg, while Tiffany & Co.’s CEO Alessandro Bogliolo stated in mid-October that the company’s “business has rebounded following the first quarter and continues to rebound in the third quarter, especially in Mainland China.”"
"After a Stock Rally, LVMH's Bernard Arnault Is Once Again the World's Second-Richest Person - Yahoo Life","Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3RvY2stcmFsbHktbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtMjAzMjM3MTQzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s leading luxury executive is almost back on top.

After a serious stock rally added $7 billion to his already considerable wealth, LVMH owner Bernard Arnault is officially the world’s second-richest person with $137 billion to his name, according to Forbes. The surge came on the heels of the news that American pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer has a promising trial vaccine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This most recent increase caps off a fruitful two weeks which have seen Arnault’s wealth grow by $16 billion, a sum now more than the price his company paid to acquire Tiffany & Co.

Late last year, the business titan was (very) briefly the world’s wealthiest individual before scooting down a couple of notches as the coffers of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ballooned. Arnault has seen the value of his luxury conglomerate plummet as the coronavirus pandemic has forced most of his brands––which include the likes of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi––to temporarily shutter stores, and as travel restrictions have eliminated the lucrative line of tourist spending.

Arnault currently sits between top-ranked Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $184 billion and Bill Gates whose net worth is $119 billion. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index, there are now five billionaires (including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk) in the world worth at least $100 billion; this is the first time that’s ever been the case. It’s significant that Arnault, who trades primarily in luxury fashion and leather goods, sits neck and neck with the most influential tech entrepreneurs.

However, the recent windfall doesn’t mean there aren’t still considerable hurdles for Arnault if he hopes to see his business recover. Unlike some of the billionaires ranked at the top of the list who saw their valuation explode during lockdown (such as Bezos), Arnault watched his fall. Luxury fashion has been slow to embrace digital leaving several LVMH brands without a substantial e-commerce footprint to make up for the elimination of most in-person transactions.

Fortunately, the business is turning around. Because China’s lockdown was so restrictive, it was also shorter, which has allowed customers to return to stores where they were ready to spend. But with coronavirus once again surging across Europe and rates higher than ever in the United States, this recovery is almost sure to be a shaky one.

A new streetwear empire? Vans’ owner just bought Supreme – for US$2 billion - Style,"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMDkyMzQvdmFucy1hbmQtbm9ydGgtZmFjZS1vd25lci1qdXN0LWJvdWdodC1zdXByZW1lLXVzMtIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMDkyMzQvdmFucy1hbmQtbm9ydGgtZmFjZS1vd25lci1qdXN0LWJvdWdodC1zdXByZW1lLXVzMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Everyone needs an edge right now,” said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners. “I think a lot of these brands are just becoming old and staid.”

With its US$2.1 billion acquisition of streetwear pioneer Supreme, VF is adding another hot name to a stable of brands that already includes the North Face, Vans and Timberland.

From LVMH to Capri to Tapestry, makers of luxury apparel are well known for pulling together complementary brands under a single banner . Now, VF Corp is testing whether that strategy can work at the lower end of the market.

With a deal built as much around brand cachet as bottom line results, VF is taking a page from luxury rivals such as Capri Holdings, which has acquired Versace and Jimmy Choo in recent years, and LVMH, which continues to pursue a deal for jewellery icon Tiffany & Co. Along with Tapestry, which owns Coach and Kate Spade, the high-end labels have long pursued a model of joining forces under one house to increase their brand value and claim a greater market share in the process.

Luxury acquisitions often have different goals than deals for entry-level brands, said Simeon Siegel, managing director and retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Rather than simply seeking to increase sales, high-end tie-ups are often built around trying to “sell more expensively”, he said, and the Supreme acquisition is “somewhere in between”.

“Supreme sits in a rarefied spot of remaining true to who they are, maintaining their scarcity value, and now they have the backing of a much larger company,” Siegel said. “All of a sudden they have the infrastructure.”

Investors like the strategy: VF’s stock soared after the deal was announced the most in a single day in 33 years.

This isn’t the first time middle-tier American retailers have tried this strategy. VF itself has been successful onboarding brands in the past like with Timberland in 2011. PVH Corp, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, has had strength in China.

On the other hand, L Brands has unloaded several of its holdings – including Abercrombie & Fitch and The Limited – and one of its two remaining brands, Victoria’s Secret, is struggling.

One difference between the luxury houses and down-market collections of brands is that the high-end labels typically have more cash on their balance sheets, giving them more flexibility and protection in uneven markets, said Bloomberg Intelligence retail analyst Poonam Goyal.

Supreme walks a fine line in the apparel world, offering clothes at affordable prices while also maintaining exclusivity that brings shoppers back week by week. The New York-based streetwear brand, started in 1994 to cater to the skateboarding crowd, offers VF a different level of brand appeal than past acquisitions.

“If it’s the right fit and it makes sense, it’s the diversification they need and it gives them access to a whole new customer,” Santaniello said.

"LVMH stocks price is up by 0.8%, reaches historic level - Eurasia Business News","Sat, 21 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZXVyYXNpYWJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS8yMS9sdm1oLXN0b2Nrcy1wcmljZS1pcy11cC1ieS0wLTgtcmVhY2hlcy1oaXN0b3JpYy1sZXZlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Eurasia Business News – November 21, 2020

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton commonly known as LVMH, is a French multinational corporation and conglomerate specializing in luxury goods, headquartered in Paris, France.

As luxury industry has returned to its peaks on the stock market for a few sessions, following the announcements of the scientific research progress on anti-covid-19 vaccines, LVMH stock price is back on record levels at 492.55 euros on Friday at close 5:37PM CET, up 0.8%. The group’s capitalization reached 248.51 billion euros on the Paris stock exchange CAC40.

The file had been particularly sought at the end of October after the announcement in November 2019 of a merger agreement with Tiffany to buy the iconic U.S. jewellery maker. The price of the tender offer was reduced from 135 to 131.50 dollars per share, allowing LMVH to save about 430 million dollars, or about 3% of the initial purchase price of some 16 billion dollars. The other terms of the proposed merger remained unchanged and the announced agreement put an end to all legal actions opposing the Louis Vuitton owner and Tiffany before the Delaware Court.

Roger N. Farah, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tiffany, commented :

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger. The Board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Bernard Arnault, President and CEO of LVMH, commented:

“This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s Board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details. We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

LVMH stocks price progressed on October 29 after having reached an agreement with Tiffany to buy the American jeweller.

Analysts see the transaction as positive in the long term as it will allow LVMH to grow in the attractive watch and jewellery industry. The strength of LVMH group lies in its Fashion and Leather Goods division, which should still represent around two thirds of its EBIT after the merger operation with Tiffany.

Report: World's Top 10 Luxury Labels Generate Over Half of All Luxury Sales - HYPEBEAST,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzExL2RlbG9pdHRlLWx1eHVyeS1jb21wYW55LWJyYW5kcy10b3AtMTAtMjAxOS1yZXZlbnVlLWxpc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic initiated long term disruption in the luxury industry, business was booming. In a new report issued by Deloitte, it was noted that not only did the world’s top 100 luxury goods imprints garner revenue of over $281 billion USD in 2019, but the top 10 of those labels actually brought in over half of that sum.

LVMH ($37.5 billion USD), Kering ($17.8 billion USD) and Estée Lauder ($14.9 billion USD) lead the pack in the first, second and third spots, respectively, raking in over a fourth of the year’s luxury revenue alone. Richemont, L’Oréal, Chanel, EssilorLuxottica, Chow Tai Fook Jewelry Group Limited, PVH Corp. and The Swatch Group Ltd. round out the top 10, while Prada finishes as the 19th best earner in 2019.

It’s worth considering the scale of the listed imprints to really get a sense of their corresponding weight in the business, as the average worth of the list’s companies is an impressive $2.8 billion USD apiece and they all boast a minimum turnover of at least $238 million USD. Another notable takeaway: many of these companies remain privately-owned — many by their founding families — and over a third are Italian. However, France is the highest performing country overall, contributing 28.3% of the total sales, the largest share of any region.

Deloitte’s findings only cover the companies’ reported revenues in 2019 — it’s fair to assume that their 2020 report will be comparatively pessimistic, as evidenced by the ping-ponging returns plaguing labels like Hermès."
WHAT TIFFANY & CO COULD LOOK LIKE AFTER LVMH TAKES OVER - CULTED,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY3VsdGVkLmNvbS93aGF0LXRpZmZhbnktY28tY291bGQtbG9vay1saWtlLWFmdGVyLWx2bWgtdGFrZXMtb3Zlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What Tiffany & Co Could Look Like After LVMH Takes Over.

LVMH is set to acquire Tiffany and Co for $15.8 billion. What will that mean for the luxury jewellery company? Pending shareholder approval, this will be the 75th brand that LVMH has acquired through acquisition.

Tiffany & Co, once a staple in the world of luxury jewellery, has been on a steady decline in the past few years. Already the deal has lead to controversy, with many within both businesses unsure about the direction that they will head.

LVMH as of late has been able to reinvent brands with great success, from Louis Vuitton’s collaboration with Supreme to establishing Rimowa as the trendy suitcase in everyone’s overhead locker. However, dealing with Tiffany & Co may be more difficult, purely due to the heritage that they have tried to hold on to. Despite success in mainland China in 2020, it has lost its appeal in the west, with many finding it antiquated and lacklustre. This is seen especially in their new products, such as the Tiffany T1 Wide Hinged Bangle Bracelet, which Benedict Auld, founder of Lapidarius said it was as if it were “designed by an intern.”

So what does Tiffany & Co do next? With the deal yet to be completed, we have no confirmation as to their official strategy. However, it is safe to assume that there will be an expansion, potentially through collaboration with other brands (both in the LVMH stable and outside). Think Tiffany & Co. blue Rimowa suitcases or sparkling Givenchy jewellery. These would be the kind of moves that could see success with Tiffany & Co. And certainly, LVMH has a track record of marketing products through collaborations. We could also see the luxury jewellery company collaborate with more hyped, Gen Z labels such as the Japanese brand AMBUSH, who are recognised for their contemporary jewellery.

In the end, regardless of the direction that LVMH will take with Tiffany & Co, it will be up to the customers to decide. Unless LVMH can reinvent Tiffany & Co for a more modern and younger crowd, it’ll be a failure on both sides."

It comes as Louis Vuitton vice president Michael David is promoted to the newly created role of chief omnichannel officer.

The move is expected to boost LVMH’s digital efforts, which include moving its brands to shared technology platforms, leveraging data and artificial intelligence.

Walcott official starts Dec. 1, and will report to Chris de Lapuente and be a member of the LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics Executive Committee. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton owns Kendo, the beauty incubator behind Fenty Beauty, Marc Jacobs Beauty and other lines.

In a statement, Kendo said Walcott was “personally instrumental” in the success of Fenty Beauty, which has been said to be successful not only sales-wise, but in promoting conversations around inclusivity in the beauty industry. Walcott joined Kendo in 2013 and is currently president. Before that, she was at Sephora, where she launched the Beauty on the Fly retail concept. Prior to that, she was at L’Oréal.

She is the first woman to lead Kendo since it was founded.

De Lapuente called Walcott a “passionate brand builder” and “very balanced leader” and, in a statement, credited her and Suliteanu with shaping Kendo. “As well as developing great winning initiatives, she is a strong talent developer. She is recognized for her empowering, engaging and authentic leadership. I am confident that together with her team she will further push the limits of creativity and storytelling to launch and develop more winning products,” de Lapuente said.

Suliteanu is leaving after a 20-year run with Sephora and Kendo.

He joined the business as ceo of Sephora Americas in 2000, and helped establish Sephora in the U.S. market. He was recently credited by Steve Stoute, an entrepreneur, author and former backer of Carol’s Daughter, with helping to expand that brand and options at Sephora for people of color.

He created Kendo in 2008, and in 2014. when Kendo was separated into its own company, left to become ceo there.

“David’s unique passion for winning and his visionary leadership transformed Sephora into a truly iconic beauty retailer,” de Lapuente said. “At Kendo, he then developed a superb organization and a portfolio of exciting beauty brands like Fenty Beauty and Ole Henriksen. I wish David much success for the future.”

3DLook Pumps Up Digital Body Measuring Technology - Apparel News,"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGFyZWxuZXdzLm5ldC9uZXdzLzIwMjAvbm92LzEyLzNkbG9vay1wdW1wcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJvZHktbWVhc3VyaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TECHNOLOGY 3DLook Pumps Up Digital Body Measuring Technology

After winning a fashion-technology prize in 2019 from the luxury conglomerate LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, 3DLook, headquartered in San Mateo, Calif., intends to take its digital body-measuring technology a step further.

The company unveiled its 3D Body Scanning Lab on Nov. 9. The new lab is in the company’s research-and-development offices in Odessa, the third largest city in the Eastern European country of Ukraine.

The new scanning lab will add more body-scanning data and deepen the company’s commitment to provide more-accurate sizing information for apparel companies. It will help make a more efficient and sustainable industry, said Whitney Cathcart, 3DLook’s co-founder and chief strategy officer. “We’ll improve the algorithm and improve the quality of data,” Cathcart said of 3DLook’s new research-and-development tool.

But 3DLook’s focus will remain the same from when it started in 2016. It aims to enable consumers to have better fit experiences shopping online or at a physical store, Cathcart said. 3DLook’s patented mobile-scanning technology uses 3D statistical modeling and artificial-intelligence computing tools such as neural networks and computer vision to generate three-dimensional models in about 30 seconds. Operating 3DLook’s software starts with a smart phone. A user takes two photographs of a fashion shopper against any background and then the photographs are uploaded into the 3DLook software, which collects more than 70 measurements of the consumer’s body.

The service has gained clients such as the direct-to-consumer brand 1822 Denim. Tanya Zrebiec, vice president of strategy and innovation at the A3 Apparel Group, parent of 1822 Denim, said that 3DLook’s technology has helped sales.

“We have a 6.3 percent conversion rate after using the 3DLook’s widget. Now we’re gathering more sizing data from customers so that we can move forward with 3D patterning and customization,” she said in a statement.

In May 2019, 3DLook was awarded the LVMH Innovation Award. It beat out 900 applicants and more than 30 finalists to enter the competition’s final heat. There, Vadim Rogovskiy, 3DLook’s chief executive officer, pitched his company’s services and vision to an LVMH delegation that included Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, and Ian Rogers, who serves as LVMH’s chief digital officer.

LVMH presented 3DLook with its Innovation Award because the luxury conglomerate thought that the technology company’s product would offer brands, retailers and e-commerce businesses the ability to provide “hyper-personalized customer experiences across all channels,” an LVMH statement said. The award’s recognition included offers of development counseling from the LVMH staff.

Also in 2019, 3DLook was presented with the Retail Digital Transformation Grand Challenge Award, which was cosponsored by the IEEE Standards Association, an electronics-engineering nonprofit based near Rutgers University in New Jersey.

Ultimately, a more-precise knowledge of sizing will help an apparel industry offer better fits, which means less returns to retailers and fewer clothing items tossed into landfills, Cathcart said. The company’s software also will help support a market that is increasingly interested in personalizing product and making clothes for a wider group of body types.

“We’ve seen hashtags such as ‘#AllBodies,’” Cathcart said. “There’s been a much greater acceleration into customization and personalization.”

A trend toward digital measuring started more than five years ago, when mostly made-to-measure suiting companies introduced technology where measurements would be taken digitally, not by a human tailor.

3DLook has also been fundraising and, on July 20, it announced that it had raised $1 million in a pre–Series A round of funding, which was led by ICU Ventures, a Kiev, Ukraine–based venture-capital firm. Since 2016, 3DLook has raised a total of $4.2 million from Boost VC, a technology accelerator based in San Mateo, Calif., as well as from other venture-capital firms such as 500 Startups, U Ventures and Natalia Vodianova, a supermodel and philanthropist. The company plans to raise a Series A round of funding in 2021."

"The 10 Best-Selling Luxury Labels Generate Over Half of the Market’s Sales, Report Says - Robb Report","Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sdXh1cnktbWFya2V0LXRvcC0xMC1icmFuZHMtc2FsZXMtMTIzNDU4MzI2NC_SAVZodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vbHV4dXJ5LW1hcmtldC10b3AtMTAtYnJhbmRzLXNhbGVzLTEyMzQ1ODMyNjQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The market may seem flooded with purveyors of luxury goods these days, but elite brands still dominate the sector, according to a new report.

Before the pandemic brought the luxury market to a screeching halt, it was doing unprecedented business. The top 100 companies generated revenue exceeding $281 billion in 2019, up $15 billion from the year prior. And that number was buoyed by the market’s most successful labels. In fact, the top 10 best-selling brands raked in over half of that sum all on their own, according to a new report by Deloitte.

Unsurprisingly, France’s LVMH––owner of labels like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi––came out on top with $37.5 billion in revenue. That figure was followed by Kering––owner of Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent, among others––with a still-impressive but markedly lower $17.8 billion. Estee Lauder and its empire of cosmetics and fragrance rounds out the top three with $14.9 billion. Nearly all of the top 10 selling luxury brands are European, and the report notes that those companies saw their growth increase sharply while brands based in the US, China and Japan suffered losses.

Per the paper’s findings, Italy has the highest number of luxury goods companies (over a third of the complete list), but France is the leader in terms of revenue, posting 15.7 percent sales growth from 2018 to 2019. This is likely due to LVMH’s dominance in the field and its vast stable of premier maisons. The conglomerate remains the world’s largest luxury group, and it just got bigger after completing the deal to acquire Tiffany & Co.

Notably, many of the top 10 luxury labels––which also include EssilorLuxottica, Richemont and Chanel––remain either family-owned or family-controlled. That’s somewhat unusual given that the average worth of the companies listed by Deloitte is $2.8 billion with a minimum turnover of $238 million.

WATCH

Of course, these figures are from 2019. The luxury market has been turned on its head by the Covid-19 pandemic, and it’s still unclear just how things will shake out once a semblance of normalcy returns. However, if post-lockdown examples of robust spending in China are any indication, the category could reboot with a vengeance."
China's Failed 'LVMH' Ruyi Defaults on Another USD5.2 Million in Debt - Yicai Global,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlpY2FpZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hLWZhaWxlZC1sdm1oLXJ1eWktZGVmYXVsdHMtb24tYW5vdGhlci11c2Q1Mi1taWxsaW9uLWluLWRlYnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Yicai Global) Nov. 11 -- China's Ruyi Technology Group, which owns retailers Bally, Trinity, and Renown after a multi-year spending spree, has defaulted on another CNY34 million (USD5.2 million) in debt.

The latest unpaid installment brings the total to nearly CNY1 billion (USD151.5 million) in defaulted debt for the retailer that features on the country's dishonest debtors list, business data platform Tianyancha shows, citing a court filing.

Formed in December 2001, Shandong province-based Ruyi was aspiring to become China's LVMH, according to Chairman Qiu Yafu. To this end, it purchased Japanese apparel maker Renown, French Sandro-owner SMCP, and Swiss luxury fashion house Bally over the past decade.

Ruyi had CNY1.4 billion in short-term borrowings as of June and its cash and cash equivalents totaled CNY260 million (USD39.3 million), Jiemian News reported. Six months before that, it had CNY1.5 billion in debts and CNY361 million in liquid assets.

The signs were there to be seen in June as Renown delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as the Chinese parent had failed to pay the unit JPY5.3 billion (USD50.4 million). During the same month, Ruyi withdrew from its deal to buy Israeli menswear firm Bagir Group which went bankrupt after that.

After Ruyi failed to fulfill some financial obligations in the first half, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange inquired listed unit Ruyi Woolen Garment about its financial situation.

Thebe Magugu in line for next international win as one of the 2021 Woolmark Prize Top 6 finalists | Life - News24,"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL2xpZmUvYXJjaGl2ZS90aGViZS1tYWd1Z3UtaW4tbGluZS1mb3ItbmV4dC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXdpbi1hcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLTIwMjEtd29vbG1hcmstcHJpemUtdG9wLTYtZmluYWxpc3RzLTIwMjAxMTE50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019 - in an unprecedented triumph for South African fashion design - womenswear designer Thebe Magugu, was the overall winner of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers at an event at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.

With this victory, Thebe Magugu became the first-ever African designer and label to win the prestigious prize.

This week, the young visionary has been announced as a Top 6 finalist for the 2021 International Woolmark Prize alongside fellow African designer Kenneth Ize from Nigeria.

The Woolmark Company - a global authority on wool - announced their 2021 International Woolmark Prize (IWP) Top 6 finalists this week.

One of these deserving finalists is Kimberley-born designer Thebetsile Magugu, founder of the eponymous label founded in 2016, Thebe Magugu.

According to The Woolmark Company, The International Woolmark Prize celebrates outstanding fashion talents from around the globe who showcase the beauty and versatility of Australian Merino wool.

""It is the world's most prestigious award for rising fashion stars,"" the organisation declares.

Essentially, the IWP and the LVMH Prize are the fashion equivalents of the Golden Globe and the Oscar Awards, and our very own Thebe Magugu could hold both by the end of 2021.

Out of a pool of 380 applicants from around the world, Woolmark selected six emerging designers to compete for the 2021 prize and present their collections at an international fashion week next year.

Announcing their finalists, The Woolmark Company revealed that it has ""reflected on how [it] can better build sustained careers for emerging designers from across the world.""

Woolmark also states that each designer has received AUD$60 000 (over R670 000) to ""carefully develop their Merino collections, keeping in mind the focus of this year’s prize, Less is More, celebrating responsible production and craftsmanship.""

""The designers have also begun their work in the Innovation Academy, The Woolmark Company’s intensive mentoring program, which this year is in its most robust form,"" it adds.

Expressing his excitement on Instagram, Thebe shares a smattering from a Vogue interview in which he said;

“I’m from a place that grapples deeply with socio-political issues and where unemployment stood at a staggering percentage - even before COVID-19. So keeping production local is how I can contribute to that in my own capacity.

“This also leads me into areas like upcycling, because I am trying to utilise the resources I have in a local capacity, doubly preserving ideas of craft and handwork local artisans have been doing for years.”

In 2019, Thebe proved victorious over more than 1700 applicants from 100 countries across all continents for the LVMH Prize, where Nigerian-based gender-neutral designer Kenneth Izedonmwen of Kenneth Ize was again the only other African designer to make the list of eight finalists.

Thebe Magugu's fashion catalogue of work successfully winnowed his fellow competitors, managing to garner the favour of a heavyweight panel of judges including the likes of Jonathan Anderson, Kris Van Assche, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Clare Waight Keller, Humberto Leon, Carol Lim, as well as Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, and Sidney Toledano.

The LVMH win earned this fashion talent €300 000 (approximately R4.8 million) and a year’s worth of mentoring from the group.

The designer who hails from the place of diamonds, Kimberley, therefore continues to prove that he is indeed a true product of this city. Revealing in a 2018 interview with True Love where it all began, the 2019 LVMH Prize winner shared the following;

""I interned for Woolworths about three years ago. The brand's fashion designer, David West, asked me to move to Cape Town to intern there after seeing my graduation collection. I learnt so much from him. A few years later, Woolworths contacted me in my capacity as a solo designer, asking me to collaborate with them in their Style by SA initiative, aimed at promoting the creations of local designers in their stores and online.""

Lucilla Booyzen, director of South African Fashion Week (SAFW), expressed elation over Thebe Magugu's LVMH Prize last year, saying this ""is an incredible break-through for Thebe to receive recognition at this level. It is the fashion equivalent of winning a gold medal at the Olympics. We are utterly delighted and proud of his success.""

Thebe Magugu showed his first-ever collection at SAFW - the country’s premier platform for designers - in 2017 and has since become one of the most sought-after designers represented internationally by SAFW-affiliated agency, The Fashion Agent.

Becoming the sixth recipient (and first-ever African) of the LVMH Prize and now the only South African in line for the International Woolmark Prize is no small feat for Thebe Magugu.

We're also beaming with pride over Nigerian designer Kenneth Ize, who is the only other African finalist, whom The Woolmark Company commends for his ""preservation of traditional Nigerian craftsmanship, adding that ""the #WoolmarkPrize finalist weaves centuries-old techniques with timeless fibres like Merino wool to elevate his cultural history to the world stage.?""

Kenneth Ize's 2020 milestones include showcasing at Paris Fashion Week as well as a collaboration with the Karl Lagerfield label to co-create the Spring 2021 capsule collection.

The other IWP finalists are Bethany Williams (UK), Lecavalier by Marie-Ève Lecavalier (Canada), Casablanca by Charaf Tajer (France), and Matty Bovan (UK).

These hopefuls were selected by an Advisory council of industry experts, including the likes of Naomi Campbell, Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, Carlos Nazario, and Tim Blanks amongst other big title holders of the global fashion community.

The panel of judges will be announced in early 2021.
