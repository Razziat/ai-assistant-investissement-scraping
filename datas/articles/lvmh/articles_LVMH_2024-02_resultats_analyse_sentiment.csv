22 Montaigne will explore opportunities for the LVMH brands like Dior, Tiffany & Co. and its namesake brands Louis Vuitton and ​​Moët, to collaborate with entertainment creators, producers and distributors on film, TV and audio projects. Conceived in partnership with Jae Goodman and John Kaplan, founders of the consultancy firm Superconnector Studios, the name comes from LVMH’s address in Paris’ 8th arrondissement.

The move marks a further blurring of the lines between the lucrative worlds of high-end fashion and entertainment. Pharrell Williams is currently at the creative helm at LVMH’s flagship men’s brand, House of Gucci was one of 2022’s box office hits, and Inside the Dream saw Bulgari open its doors to filmmakers for an exclusive journey into the world of fine jewelry with creative director Lucia Silvestri.

LVMH North America head Anish Melwani said in a statement that the division will complement the direct engagement activity of its brands. “At LVMH, we see each house as a house of stories, a distinctive creator of culture,” he added.

22 Montaigne will be overseen by a committee of LVMH executives led by Antoine Arnault, who is the LVMH head of image and environment, among other roles, and Melwani, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH North America.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999954104423523}",neutral,0.999954104423523,0

Luxury giant LVMH is making a push to gain share of the global luxury watch business, with a newly formed watch division and an array of new, higher-priced models. Sales of luxury watches worldwide are estimated at about $30 billion this year, according to market research firm IMARC Group. They're expected to grow to more than $37 billion by 2032, as global wealth increases and Generation Z and millennials become more interested in high-end mechanical watches. LVMH's jewelry and watch division posted sales of $11.8 billion in 2023, representing a 7% increase in organic growth. The luxury giant now has 10 watch brands, including TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, along with fashion and jewelry brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Dior that also make watches. Last month, the company named Frederic Arnault, the 29-year-old son of LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH Watches, which includes the TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith brands. Analysts estimate sales of those three brands reached about $2 billion last year.

Frederic Arnault, who launched an array of highly popular new models at TAG Heuer, is expected to bring his focus on innovation, cutting-edge materials and creative designs to the larger brand group. Analysts say LVMH may also continue to acquire attractive brands if they become available. In interviews with CNBC during LVMH's Watch Week in Miami, the brands' chief executives said 2024 is already shaping up to be stronger than 2023, when rising interest rates and fears of recession tempered demand. Executives say they are especially encouraged by the resilience of the American luxury consumer. ""It's all about cycles, and the beauty of America is that the cycles are very short,"" said Benoit de Clerck, CEO of Zenith. ""We go through ups and downs and all that, but I can reassure you today Zenith is definitely on an upswing with good traction within the U.S. markets.""

Watch sales are following a similar pattern to the broader luxury market, where the wealthiest consumers remain strongest. Executives say the wealthy are less affected by rising rates and economic uncertainty, so more and more brands are catering to the ""super-spenders"" and VIP collectors who continue to spend on the highest quality and craftsmanship. ""The high end has been really one of the main drivers of our growth,"" said Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Bulgari. ""I think the wealthy more than ever are eager to invest in authentic, reputable and timeless brands."" Babin said he's seeing rising strength at the high end throughout Bulgari's businesses, which now include hotels, fashion and fragrances. ""We sold more high-end jewelry, more high-end watches, more high-end bags,"" Babin said, showing off one of Bulgari's coveted yellow-gold Serpenti Secret watches that retails for $350,000.

LVMH is also targeting the fastest-growing segment of luxury watches: women's watches. While women's watches account for only about a third of total sales, women's interest in luxury mechanical watches has soared from more exposure on social media and a growing number of models designed for women. The rising global population of wealthy women — both self-made and inherited — is also fueling sales growth. ""The trend is toward more and more feminine and more unisex watches,"" said Babin. ""Women have increasing power, in terms of independence, autonomy and purchasing power. We think that will continue.""

Reinvention

In the highly competitive luxury watch world, brands have to constantly innovate with materials, complications and designs to gain share and keep collectors engaged.

TAG Heuer, which has its roots in car racing, scored a huge hit with its Carrera Plasma, using lab-grown diamonds. Its Carrera Plasma Diamant d'Avant-Garde Chronograph Tourbillon is priced at upward of $500,000 — and has a waitlist of more than two years. TAG Heuer also unveiled a teal-green Carrera Glassbox Chronograph with a teal-green dial, referencing a shade of green used in auto racing in the 1920s and 1930s.

TAG Heuer CEO Julien Tornare said LVMH's advantage over other watch brands and groups is its relentless focus on reinvention and desirability. ""The Swiss watchmaking industry has been quite conservative to some extent,"" he said. ""But at LVMH, we are pushed to try new things, to move forward. I think if we want to still be appealing to [a] new generation, it's very important to show that we will work for the future and not for the past."" Many of the LVMH brands are mining their storied pasts for new designs and models. Zenith launched its Chronomaster Triple Calendar, featuring a triple calendar moonphase chronograph, inspired by its rare prototype El Primero watch from 1970. The company also launched a new Chronomaster Sport in green, the hottest color for luxury watches in recent years.

"Fashion law expert discusses work at Nike, LVMH - GW Hatchet","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ3doYXRjaGV0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzAyLzE1L2Zhc2hpb24tbGF3LWV4cGVydC1kaXNjdXNzZXMtd29yay1hdC1uaWtlLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A fashion law expert and GW Law alum discussed his career working at Nike and luxury conglomerate Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton at the GW Law Jacob Burns Moot Court Room on Monday.

LVMH Chief Legal Officer Rodney Pratt — who graduated from GW Law School in 2001 and worked at Nike in a variety of positions from 2011 to 2022 — said he has collaborated with celebrities in the sports and fashion worlds throughout his legal career. The Fashion Law Society hosted the conversation with moderator Kathryn Chavez, president of FLS and a first-year GW Law student.

Chavez said Monday’s programming was FLS’s debut event after the Student Bar Association Senate approved the creation of the organization in November.

Before working at Nike and LVMH, Pratt said he worked for a “major” law firm in the District after graduating from GW’s Law School in 2001. He said he worked on mergers and acquisitions during his time with the law firm but was “miserable” for the eight years he worked there. Pratt said he applied for a job at Nike after being laid off from the law firm in 2009.

“I got laid off at a time where I thought I should’ve been up for partner,” Pratt said.

Pratt joined Nike in 2011 as Assistant General Counsel before moving to Converse, a Nike subsidiary, to serve as the Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary in 2014. He returned to Nike to serve as the VP at the Office of the General Counsel Operations, Innovation and Strategic Initiatives from 2021 to 2022.

Pratt said one of his favorite memories from his time at Nike was forming a close relationship with Julius Erving, more commonly known as Dr. J, who played for the Philadelphia 76ers from 1976 to 1987 before coaching the Tri-State in the BIG3. He said Dr. J invited him to a BIG3 basketball game and they, along with Pratt’s assistant and Dr. J’s wife, hung out at a hookah lounge after the game.

“I grew up outside of Philly, a huge Dr. J fan,” Pratt said. “I got to develop a personal relationship with Dr. J.”

Pratt said most people dream of working for an “iconic” company like Nike but that he left Nike because his colleagues’ visions were “narrowly focused” while he had a broader vision of being “relevant globally.”

He said when he informed his supervisors that he planned to leave Nike in 2022, they said not too many people leave Nike and “level up.”

In 2022, Pratt was appointed chief legal officer of LVMH — a multinational holding company of brands like Christian Dior, Marc Jobs, Sephora and Tiffany & Co.

He said his position includes working with celebrities who collaborate with any of the 75 houses under LVMH and supervising a variety of projects, like working with a celebrity — who he did not name — for the 2024 Super Bowl.

“With fashion weeks all around the world, we have to move talent around whether it’s entertainers, performers or even models if they’re coming from overseas,” Pratt said. “They have to be authorized to work in these states.”

Pratt said working a legal position at Nike and LVMH is different from working at a law firm, which is more focused on monetary influx, while his job now with LVMH involves more “interpersonal” skills, like being able to influence decisions.

“When you speak do people listen? Are you able to get people to follow a path?” Pratt said. “And are you able to do it in a way where your fingerprints aren’t over that decision? When you’re just happy that a solution was made, whether or not you get credit, is irrelevant.”

Pratt, one of the highest-ranking Black employees at LVMH, also said he has brought his perspective as a Black man to his meetings at Nike and LVMH because he said Black people historically haven’t had a “seat at the table” in corporate settings. He said finding the confidence to share his perspective as a Black man in a legal position took time and included risks.

“I bring my Black experiences to the table every day, every decision that I make,” Pratt said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999905824661255}",neutral,0.9999905824661255,0
"LVMH 22 Montaigne Entertainment: Anish Melwani Talks Strategy, Project Parameters, Goals - WWD","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLTIyLW1vbnRhaWduZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWFuaXNoLW1lbHdhbmktdGFsa3Mtc3RyYXRlZ3ktcHJvamVjdC1wYXJhbWV0ZXJzLWdvYWxzLTEyMzYyMTE3MzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Global luxury leader LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton this week signaled its intent to get more deeply into the entertainment business with the launch of 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a venture to explore the potential across film, TV and audio for its more than 70 maisons, including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Moët & Chandon and more.

The venture was created in partnership with Superconnector Studios and its cofounders Jae Goodman and John Kaplan, who come from marketing backgrounds. They were initially connected to LVMH through their former Creative Artists Agency colleague Hector Muelas, who is now chief brand officer at Tiffany & Co.

“During his orientation, they took him to the Tiffany archives and we got a text from him that just said, ‘I need your help,'” is how Kaplan tells it. “He saw a library of the most amazing tales that nobody knows that have to do with Tiffany — pens that signed declarations of peace and love letters from the most famous people in the world across the last 100 years and the jewelry that went with it….He saw the master plans for sports trophies, and said, ‘How come nobody knows about this?'”

That led to meetings with LVMH, and the concept for 22 Montaigne, which will find and fund compelling stories about Tiffany and other brands featuring premium talent that could be podcasts, documentaries, feature films and more.

“Look at what ‘Sideways’ did for pinot noir,” Kaplan said about how the 2005 film juiced production and popularity of the wine. “Could Champagne get a similar lift?” he suggested of the LVMH mainstay, which is facing headwinds in popularity as younger consumers turn away from alcohol.

Of Superconnector’s experience, Kaplan explained that he and his partner have worked with every category of brand at CAA, highlighting as brand-building bona fides the “Hardest Working Person in America” series of films by Oscar-winning director Albert Maysles for Mitchum deodorant that ran on the Sundance Channel, and Goodman’s experience establishing Nike’s Waffle Iron Entertainment.

“We already have a bunch of development going on,” he said, adding that LVMH has brand stories that appeal to many groups. “There’s a Louis Vuitton story for someone who likes Pharrell [Williams] and there’s a Louis Vuitton story for my mom…though my mom actually loves Pharrell. And my kids love Sephora.”

A “Sephora Sweep,” perhaps? Kaplan said everything is on the table.

In terms of distribution, streamers like Amazon, Netflix and Apple+ in particular are looking for partners to get audiences to screens, and LVMH offers deep pockets, wide social reach and live events (including the runways) for cross-marketing.

The 22 Montaigne Entertainment venture will be overseen by a committee of LVMH executives led by Antoine Arnault, who is the group’s head of image and environment, among other roles, and Anish Melwani, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH North America.

On Thursday, WWD Zoomed with Melwani to chat about the parameters of the entertainment push, and the mechanics of how it will work with the LVMH portfolio of brands.

WWD: Why did you decide to partner with these guys out of all the people in Hollywood?

Anish Melwani: We got connected because one of our colleagues had worked with them before. And they had done the reference example, which is Nike Waffle Iron Entertainment. What I learned in my limited exposure to the industry so far is, there are really very few organizations — I don’t know of any other ones to be honest — that are focused on working with brands. They don’t represent talent, they’re not a studio themselves. But they really have the skill set because they come from the agent side, they come from the production side, and they’ve got some senior folks who come from platforms like Netflix. But they’ve set as their mission to work with brands. These guys we felt were really well aligned with what we’re trying to do.

WWD: Is there content they’ve produced that you admire?

A.M.: I think there is some good content there. But more, just what does it mean for a brand or in our case, a house of brands to be involved in this industry? And by the way, that’s still frankly a question that’s in the process of being defined. I don’t think there are a lot of examples of it.

WWD: Are there stories that you have in mind telling already? And are you looking to start projects from the ground up, or hook into things already in process?

A.M.: This is a two-way dialogue between our maisons and the industry. They could be stories directly about our brands, like “The New Look,” for example, or that having our brands getting involved with would enhance the beauty of the authenticity of the storytelling. And we want to give them a way to find us. Then to the extent that folks in our maisons have stories that they would love to see told, but they also want to figure out if they are really commercially exciting stories…we need an organized pathway to allow them to do that.

WWD: What was the test case for you for how entertainment can help the bottom line of your maisons?

A.M.: The connecting piece to that is culture and entertainment has always been a far more powerful mover of culture than advertising. And the other piece is with the rise of streaming. Much of the affluent population in the world pays not to have their entertainment interrupted by advertising. So, of course, we’re still doing advertising and that’s a part of our business model.…But now people are able to consume entertainment that’s more suited to them, and they don’t want it to be disrupted by advertising.…So perhaps this is a moment where organizing it a bit more will make sense.

WWD: Will everything you do be branded, like a Marc Jacobs biopic? Or could it be something more subtle like a limited series about a crazy family of Champagne makers that happens to mention some LVMH brands?

A.M.: It could be any of the above. This is explicitly not about product placement. There are already product placement deals, and there’s a very well-groomed process that’s going to continue to work as it has. This is really about storytelling.

WWD: Will it also be about controlling the narrative or will there be freedom, which traditionally has led to better fashion entertainment content?

A.M.: It’s a great point. And everything will depend on the project. Of course there are elements that we have to make sure are protected because we would not want to be involved in something that shows elements of our maisons or histories in a negative light. On the other hand, my personal bias is if we don’t give the storytellers the freedom to do what they do, what their gift is, then frankly we won’t get to work with the best storytellers. And the stories won’t be as compelling to the audiences.

WWD: Do you see doing more mass projects and more niche ones?

A.M.: There’s no constraint, I don’t know whether you would call “The New Look” mass or niche, it doesn’t matter because it’s certainly very well done.

WWD: But some of the LVMH documentaries have been more niche and esoteric.

A.M.: Documentaries in general tend to be more niche than scripted, but there really is not, at least for me, and in my conversations with Antoine and with Mr. [Bernard] Arnault and the other leaders in the group, any preconceived notion. There could be a podcast series that emerges from this, potentially.

WWD: Audio is also included in your strategy…would that include producing music?

A.M.: This is really more about longer-form storytelling. So it doesn’t mean that I don’t want to but again.…I’m not sure that there’s as much of a need.…The music industry knows how to reach us and a lot of artists use our brands and names in their work and stuff like that. So I don’t know that there’s as much of a need for this sort of organization that we’re putting together.

WWD: One of the pain points in the intersection of fashion and Hollywood content has always been that there’s often a lack of alignment in terms of timing with being able to sell product through that content. Is there any plan to bring these two worlds together more closely so that would be possible?

A.M.: That’s not the design. At the end of the day, what the boss [Bernard Arnault] has always said is you build brand desirability for the business and the sales follow afterward. So this is really about our heritage, our DNA, these amazing stories that we tell in our way already. If you go into a Louis Vuitton retail store and you ask them about the Noe bag, they’re going to tell you about how that bag was designed to hold five bottles of Champagne. That’s actually what defined the thing. If you’ve seen our Christian Dior exhibit, that’s another form of storytelling that we do really well. Entertainment storytelling is another skill. The commercial goal is really about another path to building brand desirability by finding a way for great entertainment storytellers to come into contact with the IP and heritage that we have in our maisons, and hopefully those come together in something cool.

WWD: Do you have any projects that are already lined up or any idea of how many you want to do this year or the pace of this thing?

A.M.: Honestly, no. But to answer your first question there are a few projects that are already in discussion that came out of some early meetings before we even made a decision to formalize this and put some structure around it. And with 75 maisons it’s impossible to try to say what the scale is going to be. But that’s also part of the point, that it’s not really a centralized effort. Because it’s not like we’re going to do 10 projects that LVMH is going to decide to do. It’s more like we’re probably going to get pitched, I don’t know, 30 projects, and those will go to the relevant maisons and maybe out of those 13 —and I’m totally making this up — so maybe 10 of them will be ones that the maisons will get excited about and want to put some energy into getting together with the storyteller to take it forward. It’s each maison’s own decision; it’s not like there’s a constraint at the corporate level.

WWD: Was there any sort of looking around at what other players are doing in the Hollywood space, Kering with CAA, for example, that spurred this?

A.M.: Honestly no. Again, to be clear, with no disrespect to what they’re doing, this was much more of an evolution of like you gave the example yourself of “The New Look,” and I don’t know if you remember the documentary “Dior and I” about Raf Simons’ first Dior couture collection. We were already kind of doing this but doing it very ad hoc.

WWD: Will there be dedicated offices for this in Paris?

A.M.: This is super asset-light. I’ve got a couple of people on my team who will help with some of the organization. We’re going to be working together with some of the other executives in Paris, our finance team, our image team under Antoine. But the idea is not to build a bureaucracy for this because at the end of the day, the maisons always decide whether or not it’s something that’s exciting for them or not. So it’s much more about giving them qualified introductions.

WWD: LVMH has some of the deepest pockets in the world. Are you going to have a lot of financing to direct toward this because you’re going to be having people knocking down your door?

A.M.: I mean, again, ultimately, the question will be up to every maison. So if a project is presented and the storyteller is looking for financing and the maison wants to put in financing, that’s their P&L [profit and loss], it is their prerogative. There’s no budget at the group level to go do this. And, frankly, I think the bias is against it. Because what everyone in the industry is taught is that when you have a great storyteller and a great project, and everyone’s feeling it, there’s not a problem getting financing. But that being said, if there is a need for some financing, to get something to a certain stage in order for that vision to be able to be seen by the distributors or what have you, getting that’ll be something we can consider but it will really be the maison’s call because it’s their brand.

WWD: And will this work both ways, like if Pharrell wants to make a movie, can he come to you and pitch something about his journey at LV with a certain storyteller?

A.M.: We’ve not designed this with constraints.

But that’s not going to stop it from setting its sights on other lucrative prospects—like in Hollywood.

The Louis Vuitton and Dior owner plans to foray into the entertainment industry worth billions of dollars in a venture called 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a nod to the address of LVMH’s Paris headquarters.

Under CEO Bernard Arnault’s eldest son, Antoine Arnault, and LVMH’s North America head, Anish Melwani, the new platform will aim to market and place the French fashion group’s products in movies and TV shows in partnership with U.S.-based Superconnector Studios.

“We are excited to formalize our approach to the promotion of our brands across entertainment formats … complementing [their] direct engagement activity,” Melwani said in a statement, according to the Financial Times.

The collaboration is the first of its kind for LVMH, which will chip in on developing and financing Hollywood projects. But crossovers between luxury and entertainment have become more common in recent times.

Last year, François-Henri Pinault, who owns Gucci parent Kering and Puma through his holdings company, Artémis, bought a majority stake in talent management company Creative Artists Agency. CAA is among the top Hollywood agencies and manages juggernauts like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Scarlett Johansson.

Arnault’s LVMH, for its part, has worked with pop stars before—for instance, the company brought Pharrell Williams on board as head of men’s wear and has also inked deals with the likes of Zendaya and Beyoncé.

The Arnaults in Hollywood

The goal of LVMH’s new venture is to help connect its various luxury houses to movie, TV, or audio projects that could help amplify the individual brands, the group’s North America chief Melwani said in an interview with Deadline earlier this week.

“It’s more of an evolution than anything, because luxury and entertainment have been connected for a long time. Both are about culture,” Melwani said, adding that the financial returns from 22 Montaigne Entertainment was hard to gauge as it was still “early in the development cycle.”

“This isn’t LVMH coming to Hollywood with a big checkbook to say, we’re going to go make movies,” he said. “That’s not the intention.”

Antoine Arnault, who is a chairman at LVMH tasked with leading the new entertainment effort, is in charge of managing the entire company’s image and sustainability. He’s also been credited with sealing a high-profile sponsorship for the luxury behemoth at the upcoming Paris Olympic Games this summer.

Last month, Antoine stepped away from his role leading high-end men’s fashion house Berluti—a move that left industry observers with questions about what his next role would be.

He now manages the family holdings company Christian Dior, which is listed publicly in Paris and owns much of the Arnaults’ LVMH stake.

LVMH’s moves are closely followed by the luxury industry as its portfolio is wide-ranging and diverse even within luxury—from apparel to beauty to spirits. The group reported strong annual performance in 2023 as the appetite for high-end goods stayed resilient, though it has yet to see demand fully recover to pre-pandemic levels.

LVMH Takes on Hollywood as Luxury Brands Step up Media Efforts - PYMNTS.com,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyNC9sdm1oLXRha2VzLWhvbGx5d29vZC1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLXN0ZXAtdXAtbWVkaWEtZWZmb3J0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is making its way to Tinseltown, establishing a foothold in film and television to drive brand visibility and relevance.

The luxury giant, owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior and many others, shared plans for its new venture, 22 Montaigne Entertainment, created in collaboration with media business consultancy Superconnector Studios.

The division aims to enhance the company’s marketing strategies across its brands in the realm of entertainment, Reuters reported Thursday (Feb. 22). The company will work with prominent entertainment industry figures to co-develop, -produce and -finance media including films, television series and audio content.

The luxury giant is not the first high-end fashion company to get into film. Last year, for instance, French fashion house Saint Laurent launched its production company, aptly named Saint Laurent Productions, and released its first two short films, Pedro Almodóvar’s “Strange Way of Life” and a posthumous Jean-Luc Godard release, “Trailer of the Film That Will Never Exist: Phony Wars.”

Plus, luxury mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and others, purchased a majority stake in major Los Angeles agency Creative Artists Agency.

Media placements can go a long way toward directly boosting brands’ sales, as other luxury companies have seen. For instance, the film “House of Gucci” reportedly led to a surge in searches for the brand’s products, such as a “257% increase in demand for Gucci bags.”

Brands have long been turning to entertainment to boost performance. Take, for instance, simple product placement, with brands often paying for their products to be prominently featured in TV shows and movies to keep them top-of-mind for consumers. Plus, brands often create tie-ins with TV shows or movies by offering related products or launching marketing campaigns that coincide with the release of a new film or TV series.

Additionally, entertainment viewing is becoming increasingly entwined with commerce, with opportunities for further integrations going forward, as suggested by PYMNTS Intelligence’s study “How We Will Pay Report: How Connected Devices Enable Multitasking Among Digital-First Consumers.”

The report found that of the 95% of consumers who own connected devices, one-third would be interested in an internet-connected buying experience wherein, if they are watching their favorite livestreamed series on an iPad or mobile device and they want to purchase an item of clothing or jewelry that they see on one of the actors in the series, they could touch the screen to navigate to the product page and complete the purchase.

LVMH’s latest initiative not only underscores the luxury giant’s pursuit of new marketing opportunities but also reflects a broader trend among high-end fashion companies to use the power of storytelling and media partnerships to drive sales. With the increasing integration of entertainment viewing and commerce, fueled by advancements in technology, LVMH’s venture into the entertainment industry positions it to capitalize on evolving consumer behavior.

LVMH Prize Semifinalists 2024 Revealed: Return of 'Sophisticated' Womenswear - WWD,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLXByaXplLXNlbWlmaW5hbGlzdHMtMjAyNC1yZXZlYWxlZC0xMjM2MTY4MTEwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The LVMH Prize for Young Designers has revealed the 20 semifinalists of its 11th edition, which saw more than 2,500 applicants — a record number of entries — vying for a bumper 800,000 euros in prize money.

The chosen candidates hail from 18 countries, including for the first time Mexico, Moldavia and Togo. After a 2023 edition dominated by genderless designs, no fewer than nine of the 2024 semifinalists create womenswear, with another four designing for women and men.

“Once more this year, I’m delighted to welcome so many talented young designers, and I’d like to express my warmest gratitude to all the designers from all over the world who took part. This year’s edition is remarkable for the unique distinctive designs and for the return of sophisticated womenswear collections,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

The semifinalists are to gather at a showroom on Feb. 29 and March 1 during Paris Fashion Week to present their collections to the press and to the prize’s committee of experts, who will vote to select eight finalists.

“I am very grateful to all the experts who contribute each year to making the LVMH Prize a benchmark for young designers. All this promises an exceptional 2024 edition,” Arnault said.

Once again, the general public will be invited to discover the designers and vote for their favorite collection online.

The overall winner receives a grand prize of 400,000 euros and mentorship by LVMH teams in such areas as sustainable development, communication, copyright and corporate legal aspects, marketing, manufacturing and the financial management of a brand.

The winner of the runner-up Karl Lagerfeld Prize walks away with a 200,000-euro endowment and also enjoys a one-year mentorship.

A new award, the Savoir-Faire Prize, will come with a grant of 200,000 euros and a one-year mentorship. Aimed at promoting the transmission of skills, it will distinguish a young brand for excellence in craftmanship, innovation in design and production, and its commitment to sustainability, organizers said.

“Many of these brands place research and high aesthetic standards at the heart of their approach, values that are also championed by the new Savoir-Faire Prize. This prize underlines the importance of craftsmanship, innovation and sustainability, three topics at the heart of the fashion and luxury industry commitments today,” Arnault said.

The world’s largest luxury group announced last year it would open a dedicated space for craftsmanship in Paris. Set to open in 2025, the Maison des Métiers d’Excellence will allow visitors to discover some of the 280 skilled trades represented across its 75 brands, which range from Louis Vuitton to Tiffany & Co. and Sephora.

It will also provide a physical home for LVMH’s vocational training initiatives, in a move calculated to give the group a competitive edge amid a shortage of skilled workers.

The LVMH Prize is open to fashion designers from all over the world aged between 18 and 40 who have created at least two womenswear, menswear or genderless ready-to-wear collections.

The annual contest has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Grace Wales Bonner. Last year’s winner was Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata, a designer who has worked for everyone from a Savile Row tailor to luxury sneakers brand Golden Goose.

The 2024 LVMH Prize also distinguishes three fashion school graduates. Each will receive 10,000 euros and join the design studio of a house within LVMH, whose fashion brands also include Dior, Celine, Givenchy, Fendi, Loewe and Marc Jacobs. Online applications for the student prizes remain open until March 17.

LVMH in Exclusive Talks With Lagardere for Paris Match Magazine - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWluLXRhbGtzLXRvLWJ1eS1wYXJpcy1tYXRjaC1tYWdhemluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury giant LVMH is in talks to buy French magazine Paris Match from media conglomerate Lagardere SA, which is majority controlled by Vincent Bollore’s Vivendi.

The owner of Louis Vuitton approached Lagardere with a bid and its board decided to pursue exclusive talks, the publisher said in its earnings statement on Tuesday. The company, whose businesses also include travel retail, was taken over by Vivendi last year.

A sale would expand the media assets of Bernard Arnault, the world’s third richest person. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE the luxury conglomerate he controls, is already the owner of French business daily Les Echos and national newspaper Le Parisien.

Paris Match, a glossy photo magazine with stories on celebrities and royals as well as news reports, is traditionally seen as an influential outlet that has often boosted the chances of French presidential hopefuls.

LVMH Casts Wide Net With Third Edition of Recruitment Fair - WWD,"Thu, 01 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LWZhaXIteW91LW1lLXNraWxsZWQtdHJhZGUtd29ya2Vycy0xMjM2MTYwNjU5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is casting its net ever wider in the search for young talents.

Faced with a chronic shortage of skilled workers, the world’s biggest luxury group on Wednesday kicked off the third edition of its “You and ME” recruitment roadshow, drawing a record 3,000 people to the opening day event at the Carreau du Temple in Paris.

In a bid to reach more potential candidates, LVMH advertised the initiative with a poster campaign in the Paris subway and enlisted the help of more than a dozen influencers to drum up engagement.

LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora and Tiffany & Co., aims to recruit 22,000 people by the end of 2025. More than 3,500 positions, ranging from block release apprenticeships to permanent contracts, are available to be filled via the job fair, which will make four additional stops in France and three in Italy.

There are 280 skilled trades represented across the group’s 75 brands, many of which are not well known or understood. Some sectors, like retail and hospitality, have struggled to recruit since the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The skills gaps have never been as important globally,” Chantal Gaemperle, group executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, told WWD.

“It is truly a strategic priority for us to have the best people,” she added, noting that the group posted strong results in the fourth quarter. “We have needs, and these needs can be met by people who perhaps haven’t considered working for us.”

The campaign displayed in outdoor advertising and newspaper ads underlines the notion of handover, portraying experienced staffers alongside an apprentice.

Alexandre Boquel, head of development for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence division, said the feedback has been positive. “People understand that ultimately, learning a skilled profession at LVMH also means being supported by a tutor who will complete theoretical learning through transmission in a very human, very personal way,” he said.

As usual, the fair featured stands where skilled craftspeople offered demonstrations on everything from leatherworking to cosmetics formulation. Human resources representatives were also on hand to guide potential applicants through the process.

“We really made a point of developing this support, precisely because we realize that many people are attracted to these professions but sometimes struggle with a lack of information on how to train for these jobs,” Boquel said.

“Each of our craftspeople is flanked by someone from human resources from the house who is there to explain what training programs are required, but also to help people write a CV and ace their job interviews. We even offer coaching workshops,” he said, noting that there is a dedicated app for follow-up advice.

Gaemperle put the accent on the regional initiatives, which will see the fair make stops in Orléans, a hub for leather goods manufacturing; Reims, a center for wines and spirits production; Lyon, the traditional home of the French silk industry, and Clichy-sous-Bois, an economically disadvantaged suburb of Paris that is a long-term partner of the initiative.

“Paris is home to many of our houses, but we have a lot of economic activity across the country and I think that is a strong message to put across,” Gaemperle said, noting that 64 percent of jobs generated by LVMH in France are based outside the Paris region.

“You and ME” will also alight in the Italian cities of Florence, Padua and Naples. The latter is a new addition to the circuit, and a hub for Dior’s leather goods division, as well as an important recruitment area for LVMH’s Belmond hospitality division.

Gaemperle said the message that LVMH wants to send, via influencers like vintage fashion enthusiast Zoé Hotuqui, or Emmanuelle Sits, a luxury expert known for her signature green nails, is that everyone is welcome.

“Our priority is to be able to attract, retain and grow the best talent. It’s what fuels the performance of the group and sustains our leadership position,” she said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.97718346118927}",neutral,0.97718346118927,0

LVMH Métiers d'Excellence and Loro Piana Launch Sophomore Edition of Prize Dedicated to Italian Craftsmanship - WWD,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sb3JvLXBpYW5hLWx2bWgtbWV0aWVycy1kZXhjZWxsZW5jZS1pdGFsaWFuLWNyYWZ0c21hbnNoaXAtcHJpemUtMTIzNjIwMzI5OC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — On the first day of Milan Fashion Week, LVMH Métiers d’Excellence launched the second edition of the “Maestri d’Eccellenza Award” craftsmanship competition, dedicated to Italian master artisans.

Launched last year and developed with Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana and the Confartigianato association, the initiative is aimed at raising awareness around the importance of local craftsmanship and its preservation; attracting media attention to the cause, and offering financial aid to some of its exponents.

The sophomore edition saw Fendi passing the baton to fellow LVMH-owned brand Loro Piana as the partner of the project, which each year will involve a different group label to acknowledge three master artisans from all backgrounds across three categories.

The winners will be selected from among nine finalists, three for each categories. Applications will open Wednesday and run until May 15 on a dedicated online platform. The competition is accessible to artisans, professionals and companies created at least 12 months before participation. For the first time, artisans of the furniture sector can send applications, too, in addition to those in textiles, clothing, footwear, tailoring, eyewear, jewelry and fashion product components.

Overall, the three categories will honor experienced talents and firms with at least five years of experience and which have distinguished themselves for the quality of their work throughout their career; emerging artisans developing a promising and ongoing project created at least five years prior to registration and professionals and companies that have distinguished themselves with their capacity for innovation, preserving historical knowledge and skills while reinterpreting them in a modern way.

To be revealed during a special event in September in Milan, the three winners will each receive a prize of 10,000 euros to reinvest in their business as well as media coverage and mentoring sessions with Loro Piana professionals.

“We recognize our responsibility to perpetuate craftsmanship for future generations,” said the brand’s chief executive officer Damien Bertrand. “We must pass on to them not only technical skills, but also a respect for tradition, a passion for excellence and innovation. Only in this way we can ensure that the heritage of Italian craftsmanship continues to flourish in the future.”

Bertrand underscored the project offers the company the opportunity to meet new talents and share know-how, which “can be a source a of inspiration for us.”

“We believe that excellence can be reached only thanks to excellent people and this prize is aimed at finding them and working together,” the executive said.

Bertrand will sit on the jury that will review applications and name winners. Artist Fabrizio Plessi will be president of the jury, which will also include Toni Belloni, group managing director at LVMH; Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president human resources and synergies at LVMH; Alexandre Boquel, director of the LVMH Métiers d’Excellence division, and Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana’s president Carlo Capasa, among others.

Asked about what he usually looks for in artisans, Bertrand said “people who have passion in what they do, who are agile and flexible, and — even if it might sound poetic — who have that sparkle in their eyes while working on the loom. And most of all, who have curiosity and don’t take a no for an answer.”

Just returned from a trip to Asia, Boquel shared that the talk in China and South Korea was all about luxury and craftsmanship rather than technology. “People are obsessed with this and our strength in Italy and in France is really the know-how.”

Italy is home to six of the more than 75 brands within the LVMH portfolio, including Bulgari, Acqua di Parma, Pucci and Cova, in addition to Loro Piana and Fendi. In the country, the French group employs more than 13,300 people — including 7,000 working in Métiers d’Excellence — counts 258 stores and 35 manufacturing sites. These add to an ecosystem of partners involving around 5,000 small to medium-sized companies and 200,000 people.

Still, LVMH is looking to hire more than 2,500 workers in Italy by the end of 2025.

“We are aware of how unique Italian know-how and local skills are, and how these are unfortunately gradually disappearing,” said Boquel, underscoring the importance of the award also from a communication point of view to publicly acknowledge these crafts and attract new generations.

Capasa agreed on the need to improve the storytelling around these jobs and to enroll new talents in the industry, especially in light of the expected growth in the demand for luxury goods over the next five years. He said that for this period, the industry will need for 94,000 new professional figures among new hires and those succeeding retiring artisans.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996494054794312}",neutral,0.9996494054794312,0
"LVMH Launches 22 Montaigne Entertainment to Explore Its 70 Maisons' Potential Across Film, TV - WWD","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC0yMi1tb250YWlnbmUtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXctdmVudHVyZS1maWxtLXR2LTEyMzYyMDc5MDEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s dominant luxury group, is getting into the Hollywood entertainment business in a bigger way, creating a new division to explore possibilities for its 70 brands, which include Louis Vuitton men’s helmed by Pharrell Williams, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Moët & Chandon.

The new venture was created in partnership with Superconnector Studios and its cofounders Jae Goodman and John Kaplan, who come from marketing backgrounds, and is named 22 Montaigne after the luxury group’s Paris address.

It will be overseen by a committee of LVMH executives led by Antoine Arnault, who is the LVMH head of image and environment, among other roles, and Anish Melwani, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH North America, who spoke to WWD about the strategy, project parameters and goals of 22 Montaigne Entertainment on Thursday.

The division will be in charge of finding opportunities for LVMH brands to collaborate with entertainment creators, producers and distributors to codevelop, coproduce and cofinance entertainment properties in film, TV and audio. The moves come at a time when fashion and entertainment are growing ever closer and LVMH rival Kering‘s holding company Artemis recently took a majority investment in Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency.

The purpose of 22 Montaigne will be to create content showcasing the personalities and craftsmanship behind storied LVMH brands, building on projects like the LVMH-produced “Inside the Dream” documentaries. But no doubt LVMH also has an eye toward producing bigger, more mass entertainment offerings, such as “The House of Gucci,” which made $166 million worldwide at the box office, and starred among others, Lady Gaga, Jared Leto and Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault’s wife, Salma Hayek, who is a CAA client.

“We are excited to formalize our approach to the promotion of our brands across entertainment formats with the creation of 22 Montaigne Entertainment, complementing our maisons’ direct engagement activity,” Melwani said in a statement. “At LVMH we view each maison as a house of stories, a distinct creator of culture,” he said, echoing what LVMH chair Bernard Arnault said of his flagship brand Louis Vuitton in 2022, “it’s much more than a fashion brand, it’s a cultural brand with a global audience.”

LVMH has a number of brands and creatives that could be ripe for entertainment projects including Dior, currently being featured in the Apple TV+ limited series “The New Look” starring Ben Mendelsohn; Tiffany & Co., the iconic namesake of the 1961 film “Breakfast & Tiffany’s,” which is long overdue for a remake; Marc Jacobs, who could easily be the subject of a biopic, and Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson, who has already delved into costume design on Luca Guadagnino’s film “Challengers.”

The group already works with a universe of celebrities in many capacities, from creative director roles to collaborators to ambassadors, including Williams and Tyler, the Creator, who it was announced this week will collaborate with Louis Vuitton on a men’s capsule; Rihanna at Fenty Beauty; Beyoncé and Jay-Z, who appeared in a film for Tiffany, and many more. No doubt, 22 Montaigne will be looking to leverage those relationships more.

Superconnector Studios, based between New York, Los Angeles and Nashville, is a management consultancy, brand entertainment producer and talent-led consumer product accelerator. The cofounders have more than two decades of experience creating entertainment partnerships with Cadillac, Coca-Cola, Chipotle, Diageo and more. Goodman and Kaplan were partners for 10 years during Goodman’s leadership of CAA Marketing. He also served as founder and CEO of Observatory, where he led the creation of Nike’s Waffle Iron Entertainment, which produced several films about sports.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999954700469971}",neutral,0.9999954700469971,0
LVMH-backed fund is buying a big chunk of Tod's as leather driving loafer maker struggles to remain relevant in luxury ... - Fortune,"Mon, 12 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tL2V1cm9wZS8yMDI0LzAyLzEyL2x2bWgtYmFja2VkLWZ1bmQtbC1jYXR0ZXJ0b24tYnV5aW5nLWJpZy1jaHVuay10b2RzLWxlYXRoZXItZHJpdmluZy1sb2FmZXItbWFrZXItc3RydWdnbGVzLXJlbWFpbi1yZWxldmFudC1sdXh1cnktd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The founding family of Tod’s SpA is teaming up with buyout firm L Catterton in a new attempt to take the company private, with a bid that values the Italian luxury brand at about €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion).

L Catterton, which is backed by French fashion group LVMH, will offer to purchase shares from some investors for €43 apiece, it said in a statement Sunday. The price represents an 18% premium to Friday’s closing price.

Tod’s, known for its leather driving loafers, has been seeking to remain relevant amid a rapidly transforming luxury industry where bigger players are gaining market share. The suitors said taking the company private will allow faster decision-making and give it greater flexibility to pursue growth.

The Della Valle brothers, who currently own a majority of Tod’s, aim to keep a 54% holding after selling a portion to L Catterton, according to Sunday’s statement. L Catterton plans to spend about €512 million to gain a 36% stake, while existing investor LVMH would retain 10% after the deal.

Tod’s shares rose as much as 18% to €42.84 Monday morning in Milan. The stock has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in 2013.

Beyond its namesake brand, Tod’s also owns Roger Vivier — a maker of elegant pumps — and casual shoe label Hogan. The bid marks a fresh attempt by the family to delist Tod’s after a previous offer in 2022 failed to get enough shareholder support.

Tod’s Chairman Diego Della Valle said leaving the stock exchange “is the most appropriate strategic choice” and would “provide further benefits to the future development of Tod’s Group, built through continuous investments and challenging goals.”

The deal would deepen Diego Della Valle’s ties with LVMH, where he is a board member. The conglomerate already controls Italian luxury brands such as Bulgari, Fendi and Loro Piana.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is advising L Catterton on the deal, while the majority shareholders are working with Bank of America Corp.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996193647384644}",neutral,0.9996193647384644,0
The strategic vision behind LVMH's luxury watch renaissance - Jing Daily,"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy90aGUtc3RyYXRlZ2ljLXZpc2lvbi1iZWhpbmQtbHZtaC1zLWx1eHVyeS13YXRjaC1yZW5haXNzYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

The fifth annual LVMH Watch Week showcased groundbreaking new timepieces from the luxury group's watch brands, marking an important moment for the high-end watch industry. Hosted in Miami from January 28 to February 1, this year's event was notable for the revitalization of heritage maisons Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta under La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton.

This move, along with the appointment of 29-year-old Frédéric Arnault as CEO of LVMH Watches, signals a broader generational shift aimed at driving innovation and engaging younger consumers.

The event brought to the fore the latest offerings from LVMH's elite watchmaking maisons, each unveiling technical prowess and designs catering to modern tastes.

Perhaps most importantly this year, LVMH's increasingly diversified portfolio of watch brands, ranging from the likes of Louis Vuitton and Dior to Zenith and Hublot, could position the group to dominate the high-end timepiece segment. In 2023, LVMH reported a 7% increase in organic growth for its jewelry and watch division, reaching $11.8 billion in sales.

Miami's selection as host city for this year's event aligned with LVMH's focus on culture hubs with affluent demographics. Stéphane Bianchi and Frédéric Arnault stated that the locale reflects the company's global outlook and commitment to engaging consumers through partnerships with institutions like the Miami Design District.

Also notable this year is the fanfare surrounding the revival of Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta under the guidance of watchmaking experts, a move that underscores LVMH's stated commitment to blending heritage with contemporary innovation. As Frédéric Arnault noted of the move, ""We are honored to reintroduce these storied maisons and build upon their legacies by leveraging modern technical expertise.""

Notable models displayed included Daniel Roth's Tourbillon Souscription with an elegant case shape and 80-hour power reserve. Further homage was paid to Gérald Genta's iconic designs like the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak by accessing his creative archives.

The Jing Take

LVMH Watch Week 2024 in Miami served as a testament to the luxury conglomerate's heightened focus on the $30 billion global luxury watch market. Now boasting an array of high-end watch brands, including TAG Heuer, Hublot, and Zenith, alongside its portfolio of fashion and jewelry brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, and Dior, LVMH is poised to capture the growing interest of an affluent younger demographic keen on high-end mechanical watches. (And, perhaps more importantly, better compete with rival Richemont, which controls brands like IWC, Vacheron Constantin, and A. Lange & Söhne.)

In China, LVMH has been targeting the younger consumer market with the launch of its new Tmall stores. LVMH-owned Hublot opened its first Tmall boutique, alongside the launch of its exclusive Chinese New Year dragon collection. Meanwhile, the French luxury conglomerate’s other brands Tiffany & Co, and Chaumet also revealed their newest Tmall stores in January.

Beyond the Chinese consumer, with the world's luxury watch sales projected to swell to over $37 billion by 2032, driven by increasing global wealth and the ascendant purchasing power of Generation Z and millennials, LVMH's recent moves in the watch space have been forward-thinking. The appointment of young leader Frederic Arnault as CEO of LVMH Watches underscores this new direction.

Additionally, the company's offerings, such as the $6,550 TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph, have been designed to resonate with this emerging consumer base, which has shown resilience in the US market — a region where Swiss watch exports exceeded $4.2 billion in the previous year.

For this year's installment, LVMH leveraged Watch Week both as a display of its horological prowess as well as its ability to blend historic prestige with technology, materials, and design. Amid rising interest rates and recession concerns, industry leaders like Benoit de Clerck of Zenith are optimistic, citing the short economic cycles and the ""super-spenders'"" continued investment in high-quality craftsmanship as reasons for the sector's buoyancy.

Moreover, LVMH's strategic targeting of the women's watch segment — a market that's seen a surge due to increased social media exposure and a growing number of designs catering to female consumers — speaks to its nuanced understanding of market trends. This is reflected in its introduction of models such as the Carrera Plasma Diamant d’Avant-Garde Chronograph Tourbillon, a high-ticket item with a two-year waitlist, and the exploration of heritage-inspired designs for modern collections.

Key Takeaways

LVMH Watch Week 2024 in Miami highlighted the luxury group's focus on the high-end watch market, now boasting brands like TAG Heuer, Hublot, Zenith, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, and Dior.

The revival of heritage maisons Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta under La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton signals a blending of heritage and innovation.

The appointment of 29-year-old Frédéric Arnault as CEO of LVMH Watches reflects a generational shift towards engaging younger luxury consumers.

LVMH is also targeting younger demographics through launches on Tmall in China and designs like the $6,550 TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph.

What's next? LVMH will continue expanding in the surging women's luxury watch segment, leveraging social media marketing and demand from female consumers. However, the company will balance this focus by maintaining heritage men's models catering to ""super spender"" clients less impacted by macroeconomic cycles and rising interest rates.

Riding the Wave of Luxury With LVMH - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yaWRpbmctd2F2ZS1sdXh1cnktbHZtaC0xNjIwNTk2MzEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The annual Bain-Altagamma Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study, which was released on Jan. 18, showed that global luxury spending hit a new record. Global luxury spending reached its peak in 2023 with remarkable 8% to 10% growth, reaching a staggering 1.50 trillion euros ($1.60 trillion).

Between 2019 and 2023, the study found the total luxury industry grew 18% to 20% while personal luxury goods experienced 28% to 30% overall growth. The fine wines and spirits market also grew between 31% and 33% over the same period.Interestingly, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMHF) (MIL:LVMH), a leading player in the luxury goods space, saw its revenue surge by an impressive 72.68% during this period, jumping from $53.67 billion in 2019 to $92.68 billion at the end of 2023. The company surpassed its industry, which grew around 20%.

Looking ahead, we expect the revenue of LVMH to continue growing along with the overall luxury industry as spending growth rises from an estimated 1.5 trillion euros today to 2.5 trillion euros by 2030.

According to some market studies, there are some main factors that will profoundly shape the luxury goods market leading up to 2030:

Chinese consumers that represent 35% of global purchases of luxury goods will regain the spending power they had prior to the pandemic and become the dominant nationality for luxury goods. The next biggest luxury markets globally are America and Europe (24% to 26% respectively of global purchases).

Younger generations, like millennials and gen Z, are increasingly embracing luxury goods, driven by self-expression and a desire for quality experiences. And these generations are projected to become the biggest buyers of luxury by far, representing nearly 85% of global purchases.

So the world of luxury is booming, and LVMH stands at the forefront, strategically positioned with its diverse portfolio of iconic brands to reap the rewards of this upswing.

About LVMH

LVMH is a French multinational corporation founded in 1987 from the merger of Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton. It is one of the world's leading luxury goods conglomerates that owns and operates over 70 brands across various sectors of the luxury market.

Some brands under LVMH include Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Bulgari, Chaumet, Fred, Hublot, Tag Heuer, Hennessy, Moet & Chandon, Dom Perigno and many more.

LVMH's strength lies in its diverse portfolio of strong brands that cater to a specific segment of the luxury market. It also focuses on quality and craftsmanship with high-quality materials and attention to detail. The company sucessfully maintains the image and desirability of its brands through marketing and communication and has a well-established distribution network with thousands of stores and online channels worldwide.

Strong organic revenue growth is happening across all business groups except Wines and Spirits, and is seeing market share gains worldwide. Double-digit organic revenue growth is occurring in Europe, Japan and Asia.

LVMH's profitability further underscores its success

Market research confirms the sector's growth still has legs. Seizing the opportunity to profit from this enduring surge by adding LVMH to your portfolio might be a good decision.

Accoding to LVMH's investor relations, the company had a good year in 2023. Its revenue jumped 13% to a whopping 86.15 billion euros compared to 79.18 billion euros in 2022. Even though the fine wine and spirits business wasn't as bubbly, other areas like Fashion and Leather Goods, which makes up half of the revenue, continued to shine with sustained double-digit organic growth.

All other business segments also contributed to the positive results, particularly in Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia. The total stores also increased around the globe, reaching 6,097 stores in 2023 compared to ony 5,500 locations in 2022 and 2021.

The company's Fashion and Leather Goods segment reigns supreme as the largest contributor, generating a whopping 49.55% of the total revenue. This segment boasts impressive growth, surging from 30.89 billion euros in 2021 to 38.89 billion euros in 202 and 42.16 billion euros in 2023. Powerhouses like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Celine fuel this success, solidifying the segment's dominant position.

Selective Retailing is the second-largest contributor. Sales skyrocketed by a whopping 52%, jumping from 11.73 billion euros in 2021 to 12.85 billion euros in 2022 and finally hitting 17.88 billion euros last year. Meanwhile, Perfumes & Cosmetics and Watches & Jewelry contribute a combined 30.31% of total revenue, experiencing moderate growth.

Net profit increased from 12.6 billion euors in 2021 to 15.95 billion euors in 2023. The average annual net profit margin is 18.62%.

LVMH's financial health is also commendable. The company has been managing its debt effectively, with its debt-to-equity ratio declining from 0.69 in 2019 to 0.66 in 2023. This indicates a healthy balance sheet, positioning it for sustainable growth in the future.

More than that, LVMH also rewarded shareholders with a consistent dividend payout ratio of 38%, with the latest dividend per share amounting to 13 euros, offering a respectable yield of 1.86%.

LVMH is not just showing off impressive sales growth - it is rewarding shareholders. With a steady increase in dividends from 10 euors per share in 2021 to 13 euros in 2023, is is showing respect for investors and a commitment to sharing in their success. This rising payout highlights the company's financial strength and confidence in its future, making it an even more attractive prospect for value-seeking investors.

Valuation

The compound annual growth rate of its revenue for the past five years stands at 11.70%. With a current price of 773.80 euros per share, LVMH appears to be nearing its discounted cash flow fair value of 794.60 euros per share.

Riding the Wave of Luxury With LVMH

While LVMH's stock price may be nearing its fair value, the luxury market itself is on fire. Generations X and Y are in their peak income years, representing the bulk of luxury purchases and the key pool of income growth in the near future. However, gen Z is positioned at the forefront of social and cultural change, inspiring other generations' value systems with a strong desire for lived experiences and a quest for meaning. By 2030, gen Z will account for 25% to 30% of luxury market purchases, while millennials will account for 50% to 55%.

We shall expect more from LVMH as it has already outpaced the growth of its industry, meaning its brands are dominant in the luxury space. It has tripled the expansion of its industry within the span of five years. This stellar performance underscores the company's dominant position and suggests its potential has not reached its peak.

Do not be misled by its current valuation, however, as its potential extends far beyond its near-term price tag. The company's commitment to shareholder value through increasing dividends and its consistent industry outperformance paint a compelling picture for long-term investors seeking sustained growth. Just when you think LVMH has reached its limit, it seems it is only getting started.

Risk

While LVMH conquers the world of luxury, its global reach exposes it to a hidden enemy: currency fluctuations. In the second half of 2023, unfavorable exchange rates put a damper on its progress, highlighting the risk inherent in its international performance.

This currency impact serves as a reminder that even for a giant like LVMH, navigating the unpredictable tides of global finance remains a constant challenge. However, the company uses hedging strategies to partially offset potential currency losses. Moreover, it has a strong financial position and can absorb some currency impact without significant strain.

Conclusion

While the luxury industry continues to expand, LVMH is rocketing past the competition, fueled by a rising tide of demand from the coveted millennial and gen Z demographic. This generation's growing appetite for luxury bodes well for the company's continued dominance, suggesting its growth story is just beginning.

LVMH isn't just another investment; it's a front-row seat to a booming market driven by iconic brands, unwavering growth and robust financials. The luxury king shows no signs of slowing down, riding the crest of a wave predicted to keep surging. Adding LVMH to your portfolio will help you ride the wave of luxury industry even better. We may not only enjoy the potential capital appreciation, but can savor regular dividend payouts. This is a buy opportunity you will not want to miss.

"Prada, LVMH, and Gucci Are Buying Fifth Avenue Real Estate - Curbed","Thu, 01 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cmJlZC5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi9wcmFkYS1sdm1oLWd1Y2NpLWJ1eWluZy1maWZ0aC1hdmVudWUtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prada is buying its longtime store at 724 Fifth, as well as the building next door, 720 Fifth, in a deal totaling $835 million. Photo: Paul Brown/Shutterstock

Fifth Avenue, lined with the flagship stores of Cartier, Bergdorf Goodman, Gucci, and other premium luxury brands, is known for its sky-high retail rents — the highest in the world, in fact. But many have wondered whether the strip, which has long epitomized glamour and wealth in New York, would maintain its status despite the rise of online shopping and the economic fallout from COVID. But they needn’t have worried — luxury brands are doing just fine. Their sales, which went up last year, are expected to rise again this year to $77 billion in the U.S. And they’ve found a workaround for those high rents: using the abundance of cash they’re sitting on to buy their own real estate.

In December, Prada agreed to buy 724 Fifth Avenue, home to its flagship boutique since 1997, as well as the building next door, for $835 million. (So far, it hasn’t announced any plans to let go of 841 Madison, the enormous space it’s also been renting less than a mile uptown, but then, it’s long maintained the two locations.) Then, this month, the Kering group, which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen, signed a deal to buy the retail portion of 715–717 Fifth Avenue for $963 million, currently home to Dolce & Gabbana, which is relocating to the Madison Avenue space Hermès occupied until a little over a year ago. LVMH, meanwhile, has plans to demolish its building at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, as well as the neighboring one, and build a new flagship — a move allegedly motivated, in part, by Rolex’s new ground-up flagship designed by David Chipperfield Architects at 665 Fifth. The luxury conglomerate is also in talks to buy a nearby building, 745 Fifth Avenue, on the corner of 58th Street, as Bloomberg reported.

“It’s become an arms race. It’s not good enough to have a Champs-Élysées or Fifth Avenue address; it has to be a flagship with suitable prominence to stand for the brand,” says Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “Not only do these brands spend $800 million to acquire the site like Prada did, but they also spend a fortune on the store redesign.”

To wit, Tiffany & Co. (now part of LVMH) unveiled a new, $250 million Peter Marino redesign last spring. Other brands, like Hermès, are renting larger, showier spaces: Its new 20,250-square-foot flagship opened a little over a year ago with an extravaganza that “shut down a large chunk of Madison Avenue,” via Harper’s Bazaar. And many more are expanding their presence in the city, like Van Cleef & Arpels, which is opening its third store in Manhattan on Madison Avenue. Madison Avenue itself hasn’t had such low vacancy since 2016, according to Avison Young. All of these real-estate transactions on Fifth also suggest that the distinction between Madison Avenue, traditionally the place where the city’s rich prefer to do their shopping, and Fifth Avenue, associated with crowds of lookie-loos just doing some window shopping, may be disappearing.

It’s also a good time to buy. Many luxury retailers are sitting on net cash balances, and spending money on real estate is seen by these luxury behemoths as a solid use of that cash, Deborah Aitken, a senior luxury-retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in an email. In 2023, LVMH spent $2.66 billion on real estate globally, according to Bloomberg. “We try to secure and buy the best possible locations for our companies,” Bernard Arnault, the chief executive, said on an earnings call earlier this month.

At the same time, real-estate players like Jeff Sutton’s Wharton Properties, which sold the Prada and Gucci buildings, may be motivated to sell because of difficulties securing low-cost financing — shortly before the Prada sale, for example, Sutton refinanced the property with a two-year loan to avoid locking in a high-interest rate on a long-term loan. One of the lenders at the Gucci building also tried to force the property into foreclosure.

This real-estate buying spree is happening beyond New York. Chanel doubled the size of its Beverly Hills flagship, and Gucci now has eight stores in Texas and a boutique in Detroit, according to The Wall Street Journal. Others have expanded their branding beyond stores, building residential towers like the Giorgio Armani residences on Madison Avenue, which has a flagship in the base of the tower and Armani himself living upstairs.

For luxury conglomerates, making a statement with very expensive real estate is simply how the business’s distribution model has evolved — from small side-street stores in Paris and Milan to selling in luxury department stores like Bergdorf and Saks, to increasingly doing the bulk of their sales from flagships, says Cohen. Hence the demand for larger, more eye-catching spaces and ever more extravagant shopping experiences. And they can count on a consistent customer base. “Their underlying core customer is never disadvantaged,” says Cohen. Spending may dip during recessions or other shake-ups, but the buyer never goes away. Unless, that is, they perceive the brand’s stature to be slipping. And a good way to shore it up? Building a more spectacular flagship than the competitor down the street.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999681711196899}",neutral,0.9999681711196899,0
LVMH Watch Week: The Most Noteworthy Launches - W Magazine,"Tue, 06 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstbWlhbWktMjAyNC13YXRjaGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From January 28th through February 1st, LVMH held its fifth edition of LVMH Watch Week, this time in Miami—or more precisely, on Star Island, Miami’s priciest and most star-studded enclave. Amid the poolside and ocean views from a certain real housewife of Miami’s mansion, the fashion and accessories conglomerate presented the latest timepieces from Bulgari, Hublot, Tag Heuer, Zenith, and the relaunches (under Swiss watch store La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton) of iconic watch brands Gérald Genta and Daniel Roth.

With the reset of these two legendary 21st-century watch brands, iconic timepieces like the Bulgari Bulgari making a comeback, and classics being downsized like Tag Heuer’s Aquaracer Professional 200 Solograph—which debuted in 34mm—LVMH’s watch maisons are taking a step forward while honoring their roots. Below, we’ve put together a list of our six favorite releases from the event.

Bulgari’s Bulgari Bulgari Bulgari Bulgari watch in 26mm Courtesy of Bulgari Nearly 50 years after its initial release, Bulgari is relaunching its Bulgari Bulgari timepiece. Famously worn by George Michael in the 1980s and Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw in the early aughts, the BB’s double Bulgari engraved 18k gold bezel is inspired by ancient Roman coins. The new iterations, which are almost identical to the 1977 version, come in yellow gold with a black dial and rose gold with a silver opaline dial on a sleek black alligator leather band. The watch is available in two sizes, 26mm and 38mm for a more unisex fit. Prices start at $8,250.

Daniel Roth Tourbillon Souscription Daniel Roth's Tourbillon Souscription Courtesy of Daniel Roth The Tourbillon Souscription is a nod to the very first watch ever made by Daniel Roth, the Tourbillon ref. 2187/C187, which debuted in 1989. The new timepiece is a more refined version of its predecessor, with a solid gold guilloche dial, an updated in-house caliber, and with Roth’s signature double ellipse case—now 2mm thinner for easier wear. The revival of Daniel Roth is being overseen by Enrico Barbasini and Michel Navas, the founders of La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton.

Gérald Genta gérald genta x Disney Courtesy of gérald genta Paying homage to the original Gérald Genta x Disney watch which debuted 40 years ago, the Gérald Genta caliber GG-001 features Mickey Mouse holding a birthday cake to celebrate Disney’s 100th anniversary. Much like the original, Mickey’s arm acts as the watch hand, in Génta’s signature octagonal case, and features Génta’s (and my) personal favorite watch complication: the minute repeater. Like the Daniel Roth offerings, the revival of the Gérald Genta brand is being spearheaded by Master Watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini from La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, both of whom worked at the maison with Gérald Genta during the 1980s.

Hublot MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium Hublot MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium Courtesy of Hublot For Hublot’s tenth masterpiece, the MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium, the brand reinvented the wheel—quite literally, as the timepiece has no dial, hands or oscillating weight. The hour, minutes, power reserve, and seconds are displayed on rollers in that order. The watch is self-wound by the movement of two linear weights made of gold blocks on its side and is equipped with shock absorbers. The timepiece boasts 592 components, a horology feat that is being released with a limited run of 50.

Tag Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph Tag Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200 Solograph Courtesy of Tag Heuer In 2022, Tag Heuer introduced the Solargraph Aquaracer in 40mm, Tag’s first solar-powered watch. Two years later, an exciting addition to the Solargraph family comes in size 34mm. The Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph comes in four dial variations: Tag’s iconic Aquarace polar blue dial, the brand’s signature deep blue, and for the first time, mother of pearl in a solar-powered timepiece with or without diamonds. The Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph starts at $2,150.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",neutral,0.9999988079071045,0

For a decade now, the prize has been celebrating talent and introducing new names to the world of fashion, and one scan through the list of previous finalists proves that acknowledgment alone has the ability to change the career trajectory of a brand. Yes, past winners—including Grace Wales Bonner, Nensi Dojaka, and S.S. Daley—have fared very well, but even those who didn’t nab the top spot, like Connor Ives, KNWLS, and Bode, have succeeded in the field. So while there can only be one winner, it’s often well worth it to familiarize yourself with all 20 labels in contention.

This year, the recognized designers hail from 18 countries, including Mexico, Moldova, and Togo for the first time. These 20 brands broke through the noise of over 2,500 candidates (a record number of entries for the competition) and are now battling it out for one of three awards. There’s the new Savoir-Faire Prize, to focus on craftsmanship, technical expertise, innovation, and sustainability, with the winner receiving a 200,000-euro endowment and a one-year mentor program. The Karl Lagerfeld Prize will recognize the creativity of a brand and award them with 200,000 euros and a one-year mentorship. And then, of course, there’s the ultimate prize with a newly minted endowment of 400,000 euros (up from 300,000 last year) and a one-year mentorship.

Up next, the brands will present their collection in Paris on February 29 and March 1 to a jury of 85 industry professionals. But before that, familiarize yourself with the group, because you will undoubtedly hear from them again.

From January 28 to February 1, the fifth edition of LVMH Watch Week took place in the “Sunshine State” of Florida, specifically Miami. This year, the luxury conglomerate showcased a round of new luxury watch offerings from six of its brands: Bulgari, Zenith, TAG Heuer, Hublot alongside the newly relaunched Daniel Roth and gérald genta.

At the start of the month, LVMH announced musical chairs of CEO changes across its watch division. With Frédéric Arnault being appointed as the CEO of LVMH watches, his former position at TAG Heuer is succeeded by Julien Tornare, who was the former CEO of Zenith. Now, serving as Zenith’s new CEO is Benoit de Clerck, who has over two decades of experience working for Richemont, IWC and Panerai. While these changes may be too recent to impact the releases for LVMH Watch Week, they would likely lead to new directions for the aforementioned brands in the new year.

As LVMH Watch Week 2024 comes to an end, Hypebeast looks back to some of the most noteworthy watches from the event.

TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon in Teal Green

1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5

Unveiled alongside a regular chronograph version, the Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon was undoubtedly one of the most talked-about timepieces in TAG Heuer’s LVMH Watch Week lineup this year. Its design nods to the iconic Carrera 45 Dato, while its teal green hue pays tribute to the Maison’s history of racing cars. The dial features a circular brushed finish that gleams with an elegant luster, perfectly framed in the Carrera’s iconic Glassbox design.

Located on the 3 o’clock mark is an azuré minute chronograph counter, while a matching hour chronograph counter is positioned at 9 o’clock. Affixed at 6 o’clock, the rhodium-plated tourbillon completes the dial harmoniously with hour markers and handset in a coordinated finish. Priced at $24,050 USD, the Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon is geared with the COSC-certified TH20-09 Manufacture movement. A full view of this exceptional caliber can be seen at the caseback of this 42mm timepiece. To view all the other TAG Heuer watches from the event, click here.

Bulgari Octo Finissimo Yellow Gold

1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5

Perhaps one of the Bulgari’s most recognizable models, the Octo Finissimo may have had several iterations over the years, but this is only its second time encased in yellow gold. The first Octo Finissimo in yellow gold was revealed as a limited edition exclusively for the U.S. market and featured a brown lacquered dial. This time around, Bulgari pairs a gorgeous dark blue sunray dial with the 18k yellow gold — a color combination that’s reminiscent of the summery coastal hues of Italy through a vintage lens. In addition, Bulgari also revealed the Tuscan Copper colorway featuring a satin-polished steel build with a sun-brushed metallic salmon dial.

Zenith Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar

1 of 6 2 of 6 3 of 6 4 of 6 5 of 6 6 of 6

The Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar is surely the central release of Zenith’s LVMH Watch Week offerings. A modern reincarnation of a 1970s prototype, the new reference is housed in a vintage-inspired 38mm stainless steel build and a bezel-less design. In place of the tri-color subdials – a hallmark feature of the Chronomaster – Zenith implements a panda-style approach to the chronograph and moon phase indicators.

Beating at an astounding rate of 36,000 vph, the timepiece is equipped with the newest generation of the El Primero 3610 movement. Spanning silvery white, slate-gray and olive green, the watch is offered in three color combinations and two bracelet options that retail between $13,400 – $13,900 USD. Read more about the brand’s lineup for LVMH Watch Week here.

Hublot MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium

1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4

Described by its makers as “a bold reinvention of the classic watchmaking complications,” Hublot’s MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium arrives in an avant-garde dial-less design that parades its mechanical excellence. With no oscillating weight, hands and indices, time is displayed through a set of rollers that are embedded into its HUB9013 movement. Adding to its raw and futuristic steampunk aesthetics, the time-teller is fitted with a circular power reserve display an inclined tourbillon that can be viewed on the lower half of the watch.

Releasing in a limited run of 50 examples, the MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium has a price point of $264,000 USD and is now open for inquiry. To view Hublot’s full selection at LVMH Watch Week, check out its dedicated coverage here.

Daniel Roth Tourbillon Souscription

1 of 6 2 of 6 3 of 6 4 of 6 5 of 6 6 of 6

With the unveiling of the Tourbillon Souscription, Daniel Roth has officially made its relaunch at the 2024 LVMH Watch Week. ⁠Originally founded in 1988, the independent watch Maison distinguished itself with its unique and original timekeeping creations. The Tourbillon Souscription captures the watchmaker’s quintessential codes and signature, particularly with the emblematic double ellipse watch case it arrives in.

Crafted from yellow gold, the reference spotlights a Clous de Paris guilloché dial with an innovative layout to read time. Meanwhile, touches of blue punctuate the watch face, arriving in the form of ultra-fine numerals and steel hands. Highlighted on the 6 o’clock position is the one-minute tourbillon, which comes in the Maison’s signature pronged look. Accompanied by a beige brown calfskin strap, the Tourbillon Souscription is considered a testament to Daniel Roth’s enduring legacy. More details about the timepiece can be read here.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999854564666748}",neutral,0.9999854564666748,0
LVMH Fashions A Hollywood Entry; 22 Montaigne Entertainment Teams With Superconnector Studios To Open Its Storied 75+ Brands For Films & TV - Deadline,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAyL2x2bWgtZW50ZXJzLWhvbGx5d29vZC0yMi1tb250YWlnbmUtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1zdXBlcmNvbm5lY3Rvci1zdHVkaW9zLWxhdW5jaC1tb3ZpZXMtdHYtZG9jdW1lbnRhcnktcHJvZHVjZS1jby1maW5hbmNlLWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZHMtMTIzNTgzMTY5MC_SAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi9sdm1oLWVudGVycy1ob2xseXdvb2QtMjItbW9udGFpZ25lLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtc3VwZXJjb25uZWN0b3Itc3R1ZGlvcy1sYXVuY2gtbW92aWVzLXR2LWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LXByb2R1Y2UtY28tZmluYW5jZS1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLTEyMzU4MzE2OTAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EXCLUSIVE: LVMH has launched 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a platform to percolate film, TV and audio format productions for its portfolio of 75+ luxury brands. Named for the address of LVMH’s Paris headquarters, 22 Montaigne has been created in partnership with Superconnector Studios. Co-founders Jae Goodman and John Kaplan will work with LVMH North America Chairman/CEO Anish Melwani to find the right match between its brands, and creators, producers and distributors. LVMH will co-develop, co-produce and co-finance these entertainment properties.

There is a relatively unmined treasure trove here with brands that go back to the 14th Century. The brands represented here are cream of the crop, including Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Guerlain, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co, Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug, Dom Pérignon, Maison Ruinart, Le Bon Marché, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, and Séphora.

“At LVMH, we view each Maison as a house of stories, a distinct creator of culture,” Melwani said. “We embrace the belief that these narratives are meant to be experienced rather than simply told, and our goal is to further leverage premium entertainment as a means to share the richness of these tales with our customers.”

The intersection between high-end fashion brands and Hollywood has been an enduring one. The Ridley Scott-directed House of Gucci was a passion of Scott’s wife and lead producer Giannina Facio, and entry into the brand’s compelling and provocative story was made easier by the involvement of Salma Hayek, who played a major role in the film, and whose husband Francois Henri-Pinault’s company controls the Gucci brand. The French billionaire subsequently completed a $7 billion acquisition of the majority of leading talent agency CAA, with both citing the compatibility of the businesses. Documentaries are made on major fashion brands. To hear Melwani tell it, it was just time for LVMH to become more proactive on behalf of its house brands, which he calls “Maison’s.”

“It’s more of an evolution than anything,” Melwani told Deadline, “because luxury and entertainment have been connected for a long time. Both are about culture. I’ve been in this job now eight years, and early on I was on my flight back from Paris on Air France, and I watched a documentary called Dior and I, about Raf Simmons’ first couture collection at Christian Dior Couture. It was a great piece, all about the creative process, but obviously it was done through the lens of fashion and Dior specifically. Over the years, there’s been a number of projects that have come across my desk somewhat randomly.”

Those included overtures for designers that might be interested in participating in books and docus, and films on the likes of Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin Clicquot, the Grand Dame of Champagne, whose compelling life was captured in the Tilar J Mazzeo book The Widow Clicquot: The Story of a Champagne Empire and the Woman Who Ruled It. Another production company was interested in a documentary on Tiffany & Co.

“They had no idea of how to get hold of the folks at Tiffany’s,” Melwani said. “It happened that someone that they knew used to work for one of our brands, and happened to have my email address, got me an email, and I just happened to read that one. And then we got them connected to the house. So this is something where, there is a demand out there. We were doing stuff and we’ve done stuff in the past, but we weren’t organized. This is planting a flag and saying, we actually are interested in the right entertainment projects that fit with the brand values of the Maison that is involved. This is not something we’re going to do a lot at the corporate level. Our brands are the ones that have the DNA and the heritage and the stories to tell. But to the extent that there are great storytellers in the entertainment business, who are interested to tell stories that are connected to each Maison, we want to make it a little easier for them to find us. Entertainment storytelling is a different Métier, a different skill than what we are good at. We’re great at telling stories through product, through marketing, through events like the Dior Museum in Paris; we brought an exhibit to the Brooklyn Museum last year.

“We are great at that kind of storytelling where we can bring the history and DNA to life, but that’s a different skill than entertainment storytelling, whether that’s through movies, documentaries, podcasts, video,” he said. “The way great things happen is, you create the conditions for serendipity. So to the extent that we know that we have these amazing stories in the DNA of our Maison’s, they’re there and they’re part of the IP, part of the heritage. How do we create more chances for that great material to meet the great storytellers of this and future generations and let serendipity happen?”

He isn’t kidding about the Maison mythology; many of them have their own archivists, steeped in brand history. Taking an active role, and even bringing co-financing to the table will ensure brands have a say, while leaving the creative to the filmmakers. The recent collaboration between estate, filmmakers and Paramount Pictures on Bob Marley: One Love is an example where it can go right. The film’s authenticity was boosted by the presence of the Marley family and the late singer’s confidantes on set, including members of The Wailers. Fueled by Marley’s signature reggae hits, the film far outpaced tracking, grossing over $52M domestic and $81M worldwide on President’s Day weekend, with overseas markets still rolling out. Some of that quality control will fall on the Superconnector founders who met at CAA and have deep experience connecting brands with entertainment opportunities, such as Nike’s Waffle Iron Entertainment teaming with Brad Weston’s Makeready in an Apple Original Films first look deal.

“They will field the things that come in,,” Melwani said. “I’ve spent a little bit of time [in Hollywood], I’ve met with a number of studios, and it was remarkable the number of projects that were already in flight that weren’t looking for money. What they wanted was to enhance the authenticity. Some didn’t realize that the brand that they were talking about was part of our portfolio because when you have 75 Maison’s, not everyone follows it. And we don’t do a great job of publicizing what’s under the umbrella. Even if they did know, they just didn’t know how to get hold of us. [Goodman and Kaplan] are insiders to the industry, so they’ll help us understand the [possibilities for] our brands, which are premium and luxury and prestige. The entertainment content has to match up with those base values. They’ll help figure out the right alignment of values and thinking with our Maison’s. And then to the extent that our Maison’s have stories that they would love to get told, that exist in our archives or in our heritage, helping to figure out the right studios to talk to. You don’t want to just cast it out into the universe.”

The ability for LVMH to selectively use its own money brings further flexibility.

“On the financing side, we see this as being mostly relatively early in the development cycle because, going back to my point about serendipity, we could of course just pay to have a piece made, have a documentary made exactly the way we want it,” Melwani said. “But we’re not great documentary storytellers. That’s not what we’re good at. So the odds of that leading to a great documentary that tons of people want to see aren’t that high. We really want to let the market work, try to create the opportunity where there are great authentic stories told by great storytellers. If then there’s the money to finance it and then distribute it, that’s the best indication it’s actually a great piece of work. So this isn’t LVMH coming to Hollywood with a big checkbook to say, we’re going to go make movies. That’s not the intention.

“What we are really bringing is access to our IP, a place for great storytellers interested in that level of authenticity,” Melwani said. “LVMH is a very strange organization compared to any other organization I’ve ever worked with, in the sense that our Maison’s compete with each other and we work very hard to keep their identities independent, and we give them a lot of autonomy. So 22 Montaigne Entertainment is going to be an organizing vehicle to get projects from great storytellers to the right Maison. All the creative decisions, even the decision to participate or not, will stay with our Maisons because we incentivize them and we structure it so that they are the keepers of their Maison’s DNA and heritage and IP. It’s very hard for me to tell you what this will look like in 10 years, because it really depends on how this works. This is a bit of an experiment. We did model it on what Nike did with Waffle Iron Productions. Because of the diversity of our portfolio, we could be doing podcasts about great female creatives in fashion, or be involved in a documentary about the champagne region and how it’s evolved. There could be a scripted series involving one of our hospitality properties. I don’t really see it as ever being a consumer brand. This is not like a Miramax or Fox Searchlight where it’s going to be a genre that consumers recognize. It’s really a B2B brand, for the industry to know that if you have something that touches our portfolio and you’re wondering how to get ahold of us, there you go.

“I’m actually not sure we are the best ones to judge what the best yarns are because we love our brands, and if I brought you to one of our Maison’s and you sat for an hour with the CEO, or even better the archivist, because most of our brands have an archivist…forget an hour, you’d spend a whole day and they’ll tell you a million stories. But what stories are truly compelling for a modern audience? That’s the storyteller’s Métier. We’re not going to be prescriptive and come to market with, ‘here’s five stories that we think are great and we think you guys should want to tell.’ Rather, we’ll say, ‘Hey, this is who we are and what our brands are, because, they’re certainly well known.”

For their part, the Superconnector duo said: “We’d be inspired just to learn that LVMH has decided to expand the creativity and cultural influence of its Maisons through entertainment. We’re honored and thrilled they’ve chosen to create 22 Montaigne Entertainment with us. We are so ready to share [its] mission and vision with Hollywood, then work alongside leading storytellers and the Maisons to share our prestige film, TV and audio with the world.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999830722808838}",neutral,0.9999830722808838,0

Video Transcript

JOSH LIPTON: How much, Pauline, do you think, you know, kind of the momentum we're seeing here with the luxury shopper, how much would you pay on that in the stock market?

PAULINE BROWN: Some, some, not a direct correlation. There are definitely segments of luxury spenders, high net worth-- ultra high net worth whose net worth is very tied up in stocks. And when they're feeling confident, when they have events and travel and all the things that go with the stock market, they spend.

But most of the growth of the last decade or two has come from aspirational consumers. And I'd say the housing market, jobs, other factors have more played into whether they're in the mood to go shopping. And they are, by the way, they are shopping.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. It seems like, I mean, it's also interesting if you look at the trend that we have seen among middle income shoppers to do stuff instead of buy stuff, right, over the past year. How is that playing out with the luxury shopper? Are they just doing both?

Story continues

PAULINE BROWN: Well, some of it is-- when you do stuff and you are visible, you also--

JULIE HYMAN: You have to look good.

PAULINE BROWN: You have to look good. So there's always a bit of a compulsion to buy stuff to look good while you're doing stuff, so that certainly plays out for travel and for weddings and other big occasions, even for going out to dinner. The reality is there is some shift going on in terms of experiences versus goods. And what is a really interesting trend, which I'm going to continue to watch, are the bigger luxury brands going into hospitality.

So for example, Vuitton will be opening its first ever hotel in Paris, Vuitton Hotel. RH, another business, home furnishings based here in the US, they opened a very successful restaurant starting with the one here in the meatpacking district. Dior, Christian Dior has a patisserie, a cafe, in their French flagship. So I think you're going to see that. I don't think those initiatives make money. I don't think they're very profitable. But I think they bring people into the store.

JOSH LIPTON: Another big topic, Pauline, we talk a lot about on this show is China. What are the trends there with regard to luxury shopping?

PAULINE BROWN: A few things. First of all, they're much more discriminating now than they were five or 10 years ago. So as I said before, there's a bifurcation between high-performing luxury brands and the rest. I think the Chinese have shown a level of sophistication that is playing into that as well.

Secondly, they're not spending while they travel to the same extent that they did. So they're spending a lot more at home. They are traveling. They're not traveling to the US or Europe in the same numbers, but they're going to Korea and to Japan. But they've become accustomed to shopping locally. So where they're buying has shifted.

And here in the US, if you speak to any of the local luxury general managers, they saw a huge drop off in Chinese shoppers visiting the US for that very reason.

JULIE HYMAN: To just drill down, again, into that bifurcation that you alluded to, is it just a matter-- is it a matter of execution? Is it a matter of creativity in terms of offering what people want between the ones that are doing well and the ones that are not doing as well? What's the distinction?

PAULINE BROWN: Well, yes and yes. It is both of those. What I would say is you take a gold standard like Hermes. Yes, they execute well. And yes, they have first rate creativity and artistry and craftsmanship. But they also have, I think, managed this very delicate balance between heritage and modernity. So how do I stay true to what I have always stood for, and how do I continue to create new desirability and feel relevant to the times we live in?

Many of the luxury brands, particularly the younger ones, I think have gone way too heavily into the trend, into the contemporary, into digital marketing. And I think in the process, they've lost their roots, they've lost authenticity. And they also have overexpanded in an effort to be so commercial. Whereas, Hermes has been very, very disciplined in not overexpanding. If they wanted to double their business tomorrow, they could. But they know that if they want to be around in a hundred years from now, they better restrain that growth level.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9600516557693481}",neutral,0.9600516557693481,0
"Move Over, Barbie. LVMH Starts TV and Film Division - JCK","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1zdGFydHMtdHYtZmlsbS1kaXZpc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Will a gritty reboot of Breakfast at Tiffany’s be coming soon to your favorite streamer?

LVMH has started 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a division that will develop television and film ideas for its stable of 75 brands.

In conjunction with brand content consultancy Superconnector Studios, the new LVMH entity will try to find the right match between LVMH’s brands and entertainment creators, producers, and distributors. The luxury behemoth may co-develop, coproduce, and co-finance certain properties.

22 Montaigne Entertainment will be overseen by a committee of LVMH executives, including Antoine Arnault, the head of LVMH Image and Environment (and son of LVMH’s founder Bernard), and Anish Melwani, chairman of LVMH North America.

The division will be modeled after Nike’s Waffle Iron Entertainment, which develops sports-oriented programming for the sneaker brand, Melwani told Deadline.

“This isn’t LVMH coming to Hollywood with a big checkbook to say, ‘We’re going to go make movies,’” he said. “That’s not the intention. What we are really bringing is access to our IP, a place for great storytellers interested in that level of authenticity. LVMH is a very strange organization compared to any other organization I’ve ever worked with, in the sense that our maisons compete with each other, and we work very hard to keep their identities independent. and we give them a lot of autonomy.”

Melwani said 22 Montaigne—named after the Paris address of LVMH’s headquarters—will serve as an “organizing vehicle” to funnel projects to its brands. So if, for example, producers want to get ahold of someone from Tiffany, they’ll know who to reach out to.

“All the creative decisions, even the decision to participate or not, will stay with our maisons because we incentivize them and we structure it so that they are the keepers of their maison’s DNA and heritage and IP,” he said in the Deadline article.

A statement from LVMH cited the Inside the Dream docuseries, which featured segments on LVMH brands Dior and Bulgari, as a possible type of project for 22 Montaigne.

“I’m actually not sure we are the best ones to judge what the best yarns are, because we love our brands,” Melwani told Deadline. “If I brought you to one of our maisons and you sat for an hour with the CEO, or even better the archivist—because most of our brands have an archivist—forget an hour, you’d spend a whole day, and they’ll tell you a million stories.”

With a discreet increase in Swiss watch exports last year, the mood at the fifth annual event was effervescent. It is a one-group affair, but the six LVMH watchmaking maisons cover a wide market demographic. Here are our highlights, plus an interview with Hublot’s CEO, Ricardo Guadalupe.

Six reveals of LVMH Watch Week 2024

Hublot Big Bang Saxem

Flamboyance is still the unstoppable name of Hublot’s game, and nothing says future-proof grail watch a like sapphire case. There is a particular allure in the never-knowingly-understated brand’s ability to craft a watch case from solid sapphire crystal. But this was not enough for Hublot, which created Saxem, a proprietary sapphire alloy with a bright green hue. CEO Ricardo Guadalupe told us that it took almost two years of R&D to create the uniform colour of this chemical compound successfully. We get it, Ricardo, and can’t help feeling that the green flash of wrist estate symbolises Hublot’s positive outlook on 2024.

Gerald Genta Minute Repeater for Only Watch

As a revived maison led by LVMH’s La Fabrique du Temps, Gérald Genta’s new watches return to the brand’s three pillars of octagonal shapes, chiming sound, and haute horlogerie complications. And honestly, the Disney-tinged dial of its Minute Repeater created for the Only Watch charity auction (postponed from 2023) sends a strong signal. The infinite happiness of Mickey Mouse’s party's presence is an effervescent harbinger of optimism for 2024, and we can’t help smiling.

TAG Heuer

With a delightful blend of high-bar watchmaking and accessible cool, TAG Heuer presented a curated selection of new releases. Retro is still hot for TAG, and we couldn’t help but fall for a reissue of its cult classic Dato Chronograph in a deep emerald green. This is not the first reissue of the asymmetric single-register chronograph, but seen here within the new ‘Glassbox’ case design, this one adds another dimension to its quirky cool.

The Chronomaster Sport is dialling up the glamour in its bid for triple-register Chrono supremacy against the mighty Rolex Daytona. Sure, and what’s more Miami than this, the first gem-set version? At the core, it’s a function-packed watch based on the high-beat El Primero chronograph movement. With tri-coloured registers on a gold-toned meteorite dial, it offers a unique wrist presence, but the bezel is the undisputed star. With a blue-to-black and grey progression, diamonds are the cardinal-markers, with spinels, sapphires, and diamonds offering a dazzling flash of colour. Who’s up for another Miami Vice remake?

Daniel Roth

Daniel Roth’s revival by LVMH’s La Fabrique du Temps is a big deal for watch collectors already deep into the horological rabbit hole. With red-carpet stars like Timothée Chalamet enjoying small-cased charm, this indefinable rounded elegance is zeitgeist perfect. As part of the maison’s revival, the Tourbillon Souscription pays perfect homage to the 1989-founded brand’s very first timepiece. The design language is marked by a double-ellipse case shape of 38.6 x 35.5mm in yellow gold, while its hand-finished guilloche dial is a delight of sweeping curves.

Bulgari

From Bulgari in Miami, there was a feeling of studied evolution in the Octo Finissimo range and designer Buonamassa Stigliani’s first yellow brushed gold version of the three-hander. But with a love of retro still lingering in the air, we’re all about the 1980s chic of the Bulgari Bulgari minimalism. Its 38mm of smooth black with gilt markers in an 18ct gold case makes a quiet statement of timeless intent.

Wallpaper* chatted with Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe about the importance of LVMH Watch Week, and how, as one of the top players in the market, his brand perceives 2024 and the event scene in general.

Wallpaper*: What does the event calendar mean for the LVMH watch brands?

Ricardo Guadalupe: In 2020, we launched the first edition of LVMH Watch Week to create momentum for the watch maisons of our group in Dubai. It was a massive success, and all the guests (press and retailers) enjoyed this initiative and the privilege of being informed of what was to be expected from our maisons for the year to come. Then in 2021 and 2022, we maintained the [event], but digitally. For 2023, we went to Asia in Singapore, and for 2024, we wanted to focus on the Americas. The idea is to change the region every year, so this year, we’re in Miami.

W*: How do you view the importance of this own-brand smaller concept vs the grandiose Watches and Wonders?

RG: We are really pleased to have set a trend with LVMH Watch Week since 2020. And by creating momentum in the busy calendar, we would like to further build on this.

W*: What is your view on the economic climate at the start of 2024 and its impact on the direction of Hublot?

RG: After a year of consolidation in 2023, I believe 2024 will be the same, and also it will be an exciting year for Hublot. I look forward to the biggest event in European football – Euro 2024. We will be there to follow every second of the game!

W*: What has the rise of LVMH Watch Week and its position meant for the group?

RG: I can speak for Hublot. It is a great moment for us to be present in the media worldwide and share the exciting upcoming news of our maison with journalists and retailers.

Judging by Guadalupe’s comments and the watches presented by LVMH’s six maisons this week, the mood in watchmaking for 2024 is bright. Louis Vuitton’s own watchmaking novelties are saved for April’s Watches and Wonders 2024, but starting with Hublot’s green sapphire crystal Big Bang, the season is off to a colourful start.

The 35-year-old French athlete, who is a primary care physician, was also announced as a brand ambassador for Dior, the luxury house and its parent group said Thursday.

Patouillet’s appointment is the materialization of “a powerful bond in the name of performance and dreams,” declared Dior, describing the top athlete as “driven by passion and the desire to surpass herself” and embodying the “creativity, commitment and excellence so dear to the house.”

Born with a pathology of the foot and ankle, Patouillet was always passionate about sports and practiced many including running. She turned to cycling at the end of her medical studies in the army when the evolution of her condition required her to not carry her weight in sports.

In 2017, she participated in a stage of the Tour de France cycling competition. Two years later, she won her first bronze medal at the world championship in track cycling. Since, she was five times runner-up in track and won the world title at the 2022 Road World Championships in Canada.

She is working toward her dream of a gold medal at the upcoming Games, after winning two bronze medals at Tokyo’s Paralympic Games in 2021.

In addition to her medical and athletic careers, she is strongly committed to fighting sexism and homophobia in sports, advocating to break down barriers on these issues.

The high-level cyclist joins wheelchair tennis player Pauline Déroulède and gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos, who have been previously tapped by Dior and its parent group ahead of this summer’s Olympic and Paralympic Games.

A premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, LVMH is extending financial support and privileged introductions to its houses to a cohort of Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

Several of its houses are playing roles during the games, including Berluti, set to dress the French teams for the opening ceremonies slated July 26 and Aug. 28, and Chaumet, whose Olympic and Paralympic medals include a piece of the Eiffel Tower.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999597072601318}",neutral,0.9999597072601318,0

The event, which ends Thursday, was held in one of Miami Beach’s exclusive enclave neighborhoods, Star Island. Miami was an ideal location for the event, since the coastal metropolis is the second largest tourism hub for international visitors after New York City and the gateway to the Latin American market, a strategically important one for LVMH.

The 2023 edition, which was held in Singapore, brought together four LVMH watch brands — Bulgari, Hublot, Tag Heuer and Zenith — and for this fifth edition, the event welcomed Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta, two famed brands relaunched within La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton.

Here, WWD rounds up a selection of the top novelties from the brands participating at LVMH Watch Week.

As the icon’s 50th anniversary approaches, the Bulgari Bulgari line has been refreshed with the vintage charm of a 26mm case and with the modern allure of a contemporary size of 38mm, available in either yellow or rose gold.

The yellow gold variant presents a classic black dial, accentuated with gilded numerals and baton indices, while the rose gold model has a silver opaline dial.

Other highlights included a fresh batch of Octo Finissimo automatics, with a yellow gold option that comes with a deep blue dial, as well as a steel version with a Tuscan Copper dial.

In the chronograph realm, Tag Heuer’s Carrera collection is growing with the addition of two timepieces, including the Carrera Chronograph Dato 30 in teal green and the Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon.

The Dato 30 comes in a glass box design that features refined ergonomics and a teal green azuré mono subdial at 3 o’clock, symbolizing vintage racing car hues from the ’20s to the ’60s.

This new high-end, stainless steel sport timepiece also boasts a dial elevated with a tourbillon cage at the 6 o’clock position, part of the Tag Heuer Calibre TH20-09 movement, which has bidirectional winding.

Tag Heuer has expanded its offering in the eyewear segment with new designs in collaboration with Italian manufacturer Thélios, also owned by LVMH.

Zenith

The Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar was conceived in 1969, around the time the brand’s El Primero movement was introduced.

Zenith is resurrecting this complication in the form of the Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar, offered in three different dials (silver opaline, slate opaline and olive green sunray), and options on bracelet or leather straps. Inspired by a small run of prototypes produced in 1970, the new Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar measures 38mm in steel and is powered by a brand new El Primero variant.

The Zenith El Primero 3610 calibre that powers the timepiece operates at a rate of 5 Hz, with timekeeping, calendar, moon phase and delivers a true 1/10th of a second chronograph function.

In addition to the column-wheel chronograph and the date, which are color-matched, there are day and month displays at 10 and 2, respectively, as well as a moon phase nested in the register at 6.

Challenging the norms of traditional watchmaking with its distinctive design and cutting-edge features, Hublot has released the MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium, which consists of a flat case with a flat dial and simple rubber bracelet, in a cylindrical enclosure crafted from titanium that resembles the engine in an F1 vehicle and will be limited to 50 pieces.

The limited-edition piece has four constantly rotating displays: hours and minutes in the upper third of the dial; power reserve reading in the center, and seconds in the lower third.

A piece that counts with no dial, its hands or oscillating weight to speak of will still provide an accurate time reading, featuring a linear winding system, a roller display and a tourbillon inclined at 35 degrees, and is manually wound via the crown at the 12 o’clock position.

Two blocks of white gold, arranged along a vertical axis, wind the movement bidirectionally. Hublot’s engineers have developed a system of shock absorbers to prevent collisions, and the watch boasts a power reserve of more than 48 hours.

Daniel Roth

Daniel Roth presented their latest timepiece, the Tourbillon Souscription. The watch includes a signature style, combined with guilloche dials and blued steel hands. This iteration is adorned in an all-new in-house calibre and a solid gold, guilloche dial. This includes a 4.6mm-thick DR001 Calibre with an 80-hour power reserve, as well as a 1-minute tourbillon, encased in 18-karat yellow gold and paired with a brown calfskin strap.

The brand counts as the first new maison to be joining LVMH Watch Week via La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton. Last year, Daniel Roth revived its Tourbillon Souscription with a modern take on its signature timepiece.

Gérald Genta

The second addition to this year’s iteration of LVMH Watch Week was Gérald Genta with its famed Mickey Mouse Timepiece. Paying homage to the founder, Gérald Genta, the brand offers up its latest design to celebrate the 100th year of Disney and 40 years of collaboration.

Equipped with its in-house caliber GG-001, the manually wound caliber combines a minute repeater, jumping hour and retrograde minute.

Offered in an octagonal-shaped case crafted in white gold, the watch is cartoonishly decorated with Mickey Mouse as the centerpiece of the dial, with his arms acting as the watch hands.

The dial, in addition to its signature jumping and retrograde display, has been enameled in-house by Nicolas Doublel with a champlevé technique, and features a date window sitting at the 3 o’clock position, in red, black and silver accents.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

Notwithstanding the latest gain, the annual share price return of 3.9% isn't as impressive.

After such a large jump in price, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 27.7x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in France, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

Is There Enough Growth For LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne?

Keen to find out how analysts think LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 8.2% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 225% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 8.6% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 13% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.

In light of this, it's alarming that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.

The Bottom Line On LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E

Shares in LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne have built up some good momentum lately, which has really inflated its P/E. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

We've established that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.

The company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis. Our with six simple checks will allow you to discover any risks that could be an issue.

Does LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne (EPA:MC) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet? - Simply Wall St,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL2NvbnN1bWVyLWR1cmFibGVzL2VwYS1tYy9sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zb2NpZXRlLWV1cm9wZWVubmUtc2hhcmVzL25ld3MvZG9lcy1sdm1oLW1vdC1oZW5uZXNzeS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXNvY2l0LWV1cm9wZW5uZS1lcGFtYy1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ( ) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

What Risk Does Debt Bring?

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.

What Is LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's Debt?

As you can see below, at the end of December 2023, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne had €22.0b of debt, up from €19.9b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have €11.3b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about €10.7b.

How Strong Is LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's Balance Sheet?

According to the last reported balance sheet, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne had liabilities of €33.1b due within 12 months, and liabilities of €47.8b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of €11.3b and €7.95b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total €61.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

Of course, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a titanic market capitalization of €401.9b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.43. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 30.1 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Fortunately, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne grew its EBIT by 8.4% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .

Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne recorded free cash flow worth 64% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.

Our View

Happily, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening. Zooming out, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can for free.

At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.

Valuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

The Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate has pitched a Louis Vuitton flagship store on the site of the failed 109-room Cheval Blanc hotel project at 468 Rodeo Drive, Women’s Wear Daily reported via Yahoo, citing unidentified sources.

The luxury fashion house has already commissioned architectural drawings for the site on the corner of Rodeo Drive and South Santa Monica Boulevard.

In 2018, LVMH bought the building at 468 Rodeo Drive –– formerly occupied by Brooks Brothers –– for $245 million.

Four years later, the firm won approval from the city’s Planning Commission to build a luxury hotel.

But in June, Beverly Hills voters nixed the proposal by a margin of 80 votes after labor union Unite Here Local 11 had gathered enough signatures to trigger a citywide ballot measure.

LVMH, run by the world’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, will now focus on building a Louis Vuitton emporium on the more than 50,000-square-foot lot.

Vuitton, now led by CEO Pietro Beccari, seems intent on building increasingly bigger and more spectacular retail attractions, according to WWD.

A mammoth silver metal trunk on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris now shelters a huge Art Nouveau-style building earmarked for “a new project for the maison,” not far from the current Vuitton flagship.

Vuitton’s women’s artistic director Nicholas Ghesquière has said it would be a hybrid space including a store, a cultural venue and a hotel, to be designed by architect Peter Marino. A construction permit registered with the City of Paris mentions retail, hotel accommodation and the construction of a basement level and interior courtyard.

Beccari, who joined Vuitton a year ago from Dior, masterminded the Dior 30 Montaigne mega-flagship that includes a museum, restaurant, pastry café, shaded courtyards and a hotel suite that offers a run of the store all night long, according to WWD.

The executive is known for bold gestures and audacious events, telling employees: “Don’t think big — think huge!”

Vuitton already operates a growing fleet of restaurants, cafés and chocolate shops as it grows its “lifestyle” brand beyond its core businesses of fashion, leather goods, fine jewelry, watches and fragrances, according to WWD.

LVMH is known for playing the long game in luxury and had spent three years presenting architectural plans, studies and analyses to make sure the first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S. was right for Beverly Hills.

It must now once again pass through an entitlement gauntlet for a local Louis Vuitton extravaganza.

"LVMH Prize semi-finalists from Hong Kong, Japan and beyond - Jing Daily","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXByaXplLXNlbWktZmluYWxpc3QtcG9uZGVyZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Out of 2,500 applicants around the world, 20 designer labels have been picked to compete in the prestigious LVMH Prize.

Representatives from Asia include gender-neutral brand Ponder.er, helmed by Hong Kong Chinese duo Alex Po and Derek Cheng; Taiwanese label Chiahung Su, which crafts all its clothes from reclaimed materials; South Korean menswear brand Jiyongkim, which boasts a distinctive sun-bleaching technique; and Japan design collective Khoki.

These creatives will compete in the semi-finals scheduled to take place in Paris on February 20 and March 1. Between February 29 and March 5, members of the public will be able to vote for their favorite entrant via lvmhprize.com, alongside a jury of fashion specialists. Eight finalists will then battle it out for a 400,000 euro ($428,212) prize and a one-year mentorship with a dedicated LVMH team member.

The Jing Take

Launched in 2013, the LVMH Prize has become one of the industry’s most important emerging designer competitions. Winners of previous editions include now-famous names like KidSuper, Grace Wales Bonner, and Jacquemus.

This year’s edition is even more global, with semi-finalists hailing from 18 countries, including Mexico, Moldova, and Togo for the first time. There’s also the debut of the Savoir-Faire Prize, which offers a 200,000 euro ($214,107) endowment and a one-year mentorship to a contestant that excels in craftsmanship, innovation in design and production, and sustainability.

A notable contender for the prize is Hong Kong-based Ponder.er, which challenges masculine stereotypes with its frayed and lace knitwear structures. In 2022, it was named the Yu Prize Grand Prize winner, and in 2023, it held a show at Shanghai Fashion Week. It has shown its collections for three consecutive seasons at the Sphere Paris Fashion Week showroom, as well as dressed K-pop artists like NCT’s Lee Taeyong and Gidle’s Cho Mi-yeon.

For emerging labels like Ponder.er, the LVMH Prize presents an opportunity to gain global recognition and potentially attract global collaborators. Just look at Rui, another Chinese label famous for its gender-fluid designs and fabric manipulation; after winning the LVMH Karl Lagerfeld Prize for Young Designers in 2021, the brand has gone on to work with the likes of Victoria’s Secret and Adidas and dress celebrities such as Jennie Kim, Halle Bailey, Cardi B, and Billie Eilish.

As of this writing, Ponder.er has a limited social media presence, with just over 10,000 followers on Instagram, 1,055 on Xiaohongshu, and 548 on Weibo. Despite its modest fan base, its body-clinging, avant-garde assortment of knit and denim apparel offers a bold, sensual appeal that is sure not to get lost in the crowd.

Storied brands Bulgari, Hublot, and Tag Heuer were among the horological houses showcasing new releases that featured dazzling gem-set dials, technical innovations, and riveting colors. Vogue Arabia highlights the newest timepieces fit with diamonds and jewels.

BULGARI

Lucea

The intense green malachite marquetry on Bulgari’s Lucea’s dial evokes a nostalgia for the ’60s and the era’s obsession with colored stones. Small pieces are upcycled having been carefully selected, cut, and reassembled making each piece a totally unique creation. Twelve brilliant-cut diamonds sparkle while a cabochon-cut synthetic sapphire adorns the V-shaped crown, also featuring a diamond. The watch features a total of 56 gems and 1.3 carats on the case and dial.

HUBLOT

Spirit of Big Bang

The Hublot Spirit of Big Bang thrives as watchmaking and high jewelry come together on six 32-mm cases. Transformed through colored or transparent gems into rainbows with King Gold (Hublot’s 18K gold alloy) or stainless steel. The slim design furthers the femininity of the tonneau-shaped watch that features six H-shaped titanium screws, a self-winding movement, and interchangeable straps.

TAG HEUER

Carrera Date Plasma Diamant D’avant-Garde with Yellow Diamonds

This new Tag Heuer Carrera colorway features 4.8 carats worth of yellow lab-grown diamonds features Plasma technology and a polycrystalline dial, a yellow diamond Carrera logo and crown. It measures 36 mm in diameter and a white gold case with matching hour markers and hands.

LVMH recounts with this watch week that “time is everything.” Fleeting, time is one’s most precious asset. Luxury, in the eyes of LVMH is eternal, therefore watchmaking is more than a craft but a savoir-faire. Its internal fabrication ateliers make new historic timepieces are intended to be passed on to generations.

Lush Décor Home expands “she-suite” with appointment of LVMH alum as CEO - Home Textiles Today,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbWV0ZXh0aWxlc3RvZGF5LmNvbS9wZW9wbGUvbHVzaC1kZWNvci1ob21lLWV4cGFuZHMtc2hlLXN1aXRlLXdpdGgtYXBwb2ludG1lbnQtb2YtbHZtaC1hbHVtLWFzLWNlby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"East Brunswick, N.J. – The new CEO of home fashions supplier Lush Home Décor brings with her experience at global giants including LVMH, Mars and Moncler.

Dr. Paola Peretti joins the company – formerly known as Triangle Home Fashions – with an international career that spans over 25 years, during which she led growth for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands across various categories.

Lush Home Décor founder Jenny Jing Zhu transitions to Chief Vision Officer and co-chair of the board.

“Lush Décor Home began as a dream in a small village in China, a dream to bring beauty and inspiration into every home,” said Zhu. “What we’ve built is more than a brand; it’s a testament to the power of dreams, hope and strength. Paola embodies the spirit and vision that Lush Décor Home stands for.”

Peretti was most recently chief digital officer at Fresh, the LVMH-owned cosmetics and fragrance brand. Prior to that, she was VP of digital & consumer experience at global food and confectionery giant Mars. She also served as chief digital officer at Moncler, the Italian luxury fashion house.

In her new role, Peretti will lead strategic endeavors to expand Lush Décor Home’s presence and influence.

“Her leadership is not just about growth; it’s about continuing a journey of inspiring lives through our products and stories. I look forward to guiding our vision alongside her and witnessing the new heights we will reach together,” said Zhu.

Lush celebrated its 15th anniversary last year. Through a series of product expansions and acquisitions, the company’s portfolio has grown to include fashion bedding, window, decorative pillows, decorative bath, accessories, storage, baby, kids and gifts. In addition to supplying online and omnichannel retailers, the company also operates a DTC business.

“Stepping into the legacy that Jenny has crafted is an honor,” said Peretti. “Lush Décor Home isn’t just about decorating spaces; it’s about enriching lives with stories of perseverance, creativity, and transformation.”

LVMH: Xi Jinping's Not Idiotic but Useful Friend - Bitter Winter,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYml0dGVyd2ludGVyLm9yZy9sdm1oLXhpLWppbnBpbmdzLW5vdC1pZGlvdGljLWJ1dC11c2VmdWwtZnJpZW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest luxury goods group cannot be classified among China’s “useful idiots.” Yet, it subtly supports Xi Jinping’s regime.

by Christophe Stener

LVMH, chaired and largely (48 %) owned by French tycoon Bernard Arnault, is the world’s leading luxury goods group. 2023 was the “new record year for LVMH” with €86.2 billion revenue and €22.8 billion profit. Revenue in China is included by corporate communication in the “Rest of Asia,” worth 33 % of the total business. Accordingly to “Les Echos,” China was in 2023 the largest market for LVMH, above the USA.

It is no surprise that a form of “business realpolitik” drives the world’s largest luxury group’s relationship with China. “Paris is worth a Mass,” said Henri IV, a former Protestant who converted to Catholicism to get France’s crown, LVMH’s highly profitable business in China is worth supporting what the Uyghurs denounce as “genocide tourism” to Xinjiang.

Paris’ Jardin d’Acclimatation is a well-known leisure park that is owned by LVMH and located next to Louis Vuitton Foundation, the private modern art museum where a great Rothko exhibition is currently taking place.

It was announced that in the Jardin d’Acclimatation “the famous Dragons and Lanterns Festival from Shanghai is coming to Paris!” (December 2023 to February 2024).

Chine-info.com, China’s official communication service, claimed that this event celebrates the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France and is part of the “2024 China-France Cultural Tourism Year.” This project has been celebrated at the China Cultural Center in Paris jointly by Hu Tingzhou, President of Yuyuan Inc., a subsidiary of Fosun, the largest private Chinese conglomerate, and by Marc-Antoine Jamet, LVMH Group’s General Secretary and Chairman of the Jardin d’Acclimatation, as well as by representatives of the Chinese Embassy, notably Yan Zhengquan, Cultural Counselor, and Liu Hongge, Director of the China Cultural Center in Paris.

Supporting China’s propaganda for so called “cultural trips” to Xinjiang, the Paris Dragon and Lanterns Festival shows large posters of monuments and landscapes of Xinjiang.

LVMH’s support to China’ soft power lobbying is not to be neglected considering the strength of LVMH, the attractiveness of its luxury goods, and the political influence of its billionaire owner Bernard Arnault through the newspapers he owns, notably “Les Echos” and “Le Parisien.”

The new propaganda book on China-France diplomatic relations.

Culture and politics are mixed in China’s communication lobbying. For example, the China Cultural Center in Paris promotes a book “60 Years of China-France Diplomatic Relations –A Marking Decade – For History, for Friendship, and to Lighten the Future” published by “Nouvelles d’Europe,” the self-proclaimed “Chinese most influential media in Europe.” It shows, on the cover page, President Macron shaking hands with President Xi. “A Marking Decade,” i.e., the time of Xi Jinping’s governance. Marking? Yes. Successful? It can be debated.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999957084655762}",neutral,0.9999957084655762,0

In our business update, we've summed up how these companies have performed to help you better understand how the beauty industry landscape currently looks, both in EMEA and on a global scale

LVMH​

For LVMH’s 2023 financial year, sales hit €86.2bn, which were up by 9% on the previous year.

This growth was at a significantly slower pace than the standout 23% increase it saw for its 2022 financial year.

It appears that the love affair with luxury is waning for many consumers – as spending on luxury goods dropped for LVMH in the US, Europe and China markets in 2023.

However, the group’s Selective Retailing division grew by an impressive 25% (reaching €17.9bn).

This was led by the popular beauty retailer Sephora, which saw a historic year for sales and profit, particularly in Europe, North America and the Middle Eastern.

It noted new store openings two in the UK and one flagship in France on the Champs-Élysées, as well as its store-within-a-store strategy in various Kohl’s department stores in the US market.

LVMH’s luxury Hong Kong-based travel retailer DFS also saw success and benefited from a return of travellers to key travel-retail destinations, such as Hong Kong and Macao.

The group’s Perfumes & Cosmetics division saw strong momentum in fragrances and colour cosmetics across all regions, posting organic revenue growth of 11% for the year, with sales reaching €8.3bn.

It stated that its men’s fragrance Dior’s Sauvage was the world’s best-selling men’s scent last year, while LVMH also mentioned that the Miss Dior, J’adore and L’Or de J’adore fragrances had all fuelled growth for the category.

And in colour cosmetics, Rihanna’s brand Fenty Beauty continued to see strong growth.

L’Oréal Group​

For the full financial year in 2023, L’Oréal Group marked its third consecutive year of double-digit growth and sales reached €41.18bn, up 7.6% in reported terms and 11% on an organic basis.

Its Dermatological Beauty Division, which included skin care brands like CeraVe and la Roche Posay saw sales up by 28% to €6.4bn – marking six years of consecutive year of double-digit growth. Vichy saw its strongest growth in 18 years and xxx also noted that CeraVe is the top-selling skin care brand in the US market.

L’Oréal’s ​​Consumer Products Division reached €15bn in sales in 2023, up 12.6% on a like-for-like basis and its best growth in more than 30 years Colour Cosmetics was the top contributing category for the growth, and the L’Oréal Paris brand topped over €7bn in sales.

Its Luxe Division, which includes licences for brands like Prada and YSL Beauty, sales reached €14.92bn, up by 4.5%, with new distribution channels in the US and Amazon offsetting drops in travel-retail sales and the Asia market.

Meanwhile, as consumers continue to put more focus on hair care, the Professional Products Division also reported growth of 7.6% like-for-like which it attributed to a strategic focus on hair care. The L’Oréal Professionnel and Kérastase saw strong growth.

L'Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus stated : “In a challenging environment of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and a stagnating beauty market in China, we delivered our best like-for-like growth in more than 20 years (excluding 2021).

He also added that beauty technology would be a big future focus as: “beauty tech will shape our industry and enable us to further strengthen our leadership,” he said.

Noting that: “It will allow us to know our consumers ever-better, to bring them ever-more impactful and sustainable products and services, and to become ever-sharper in our execution.”

Meanwhile, the group didn’t reach analyst’s predictions for the most recent quarter – the three months up to 31 December 2023.

Although group sales were up by 6.9%, and totalled €10.6bn, they fell short of the predicted growth of 9.5%.

The group experienced a -6.2% drop in sales in the North Asia region (which includes China) and stated that the region “continued to be impacted by the reset in travel retail following the change in policy regarding daigous,” in its press statement.

However, sales in were still up in by 11.6% in Europe and by 9.4% in North America.

Unilever​

For its 2023 financial year, British FMCG company Unilever reported that its total underlying sales growth for the group was up by 7%, with positive volume sales.

Its Beauty & Wellbeing division saw a turnover of €12.5bn, which accounted for 21% of the group’s total turnover.

This division saw underlying sales grow by 8.3%, (3.8% on price and 4.4% on volume) and Unilever noted how volume growth accelerated through the year and reached 6.3% in Q4, with strong volumes sales in its Hair Care and Health & Wellbeing categories.

It’s top five markets were: USA; India; China; Brazil; and Mexico.

The Hair Care category saw strong growth in Latin America and Turkey. While Core Skin Care only grew by low-single digit figures, but within this, the Vaseline brand delivered double-digit growth and reached €1 bn of turnover in 2023.

Unilever also added that it’s US-centric Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing portfolios grew ahead of the market and delivered double-digit growth for 2023, with strong performances from Hourglass, Dermalogica and Paula’s Choice.

However, in North Asia, the K-beauty brand AHC declined double-digit as it “reset the cross-border trade channel”, said the business

Meanwhile, Unilever’s Personal Care division, which accounts for 23% of the group business, saw a turnover of €13.8 bn, up by 8.9% for the year, which it said was balanced between price and volume sales, and fuelled by the Deodorants category.

The Deodorants category grew double-digits, with strong volume growth, especially in Europe and Latin America; Skin Cleansing grew by mid-single digits and had positive volumes; and Oral Care grew mid-single digit, led by price.

The group also flagged up that the Dove Personal Care portfolio achieved double-digit growth with balanced price and volume growth.

Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher added that the 2023 sales results showed “an improving financial performance, with the return to volume growth and margins rebuilding.”

“We are moving with speed and urgency to transform Unilever into a consistently higher performing business,” he concluded.

Interparfums​

The French fragrance company saw record-breaking annual sales of €798.5m for 2023, which was up by 13% on 2022.

It said the growth was mainly on a volume basis (up by 11.5% in volume sales) and driven by the portfolio's main brands: Jimmy Choo up by 16; Montblanc: up by 12%; and Coach: up by 22%.

In terms of trends, it noted that there was a strong fragrance market in the first half of 2023, but that this has been “less buoyant since last summer”.

It also shared that “inventories are back to more normal levels in the retail sector” and that “Supply chain pressure has decreased.”

Inter Parfums noted that sales in America were up by +13%; in Asia by 18%; but only by 7% in Western Europe.

The company shared that it had experience growth ranging between 25% and 40% for the 3 top-selling brands Asia (+18%), as well as very strong growth in Australia (+35%)

It also saw strong growth in Japan and Taïwan and shared that the “Chinese market was “back on a positive track since the summer” and up by 13.5%.

Jimmy Choo fragrances, now the Group’s top-selling brand, had more than €200m in sales and was up by 16%. The business said that this had been “driven by the established Jimmy Choo and Jimmy Choo Man lines, and above all the continuing international success of the I Want Choo and I Want Choo Forever lines, launched in 2021 and 2022.”

Coty​

The French American beauty company Coty is currently halfway through its fiscal financial year for 2024.

The business shared that net revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to $1.73bn for the second quarter of this financial year, and by 16% to $3.36bn for the first half of 2024.

Its Prestige business was especially successful, and revenue grew by 15% (LFL) in Q2 and 18% (LFL) for the first half of the financial year, which CEO Sue Nabi said was “outperforming the market.”

The multinational said that its Burberry Goddess fragrance, which launched last summer, continued to set new records and became the top seller in multiple markets.

Burberry’s Hero and Her scents also saw strong market share gains across the globe for the Burberry brand. While the Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Gucci, Chloé, Marc Jacobs and Davidoff fragrance brands all saw double digit growth in the first half.

For Colour Cosmetics in Q2, Kylie, Burberry and Gucci all saw double digit growth; and in the Skincare category, Coty’s relaunched brands Lancaster and philosophy continued their positive momentum.

In the earnings call, Coty CEO Sue Nabi said that Prestige revenue growth and sell-out are continuing to outperform the very strong prestige fragrance market. “While the prestige fragrance market grew close to 10% in both Q1 and Q2, our sell-out in both quarters outperformed, growing 12% to 13%. At the same time, our like-for-like revenue growth was higher, as we benefitted from the year-on-year recovery in fragrance service levels following the supply challenges last year. We estimate this benefit to be in the low-to-mid-single-digits percentage.”

Meanwhile Consumer Beauty was up by 5% (LFL) for Q2 and 7% (LFL) for the first half and strong figures for colour cosmetics, mass fragrances, and mass skin & body care sales.

The company said it had “continued to lean into its social media strategy”, which led to improvements in earned media value and viral launches such as CoverGirl Yummy Gloss and Rimmel Thrill Seeker mascara.

E-commerce grew by 20% overall for the first half.

While all regions saw double digit revenue growth in the quarter.

L’Occitane Group ​

L’Occitane Group has recorded sales of €843.4m in its third quarter, up by 19.5%, which was mainly attributed to a 199% increase in sales from the Sol de Janeiro brand.

It said the Gen Z-favourite brand, which has been a standout star in the travel-retail industry, had a “record-breaking” holiday season that benefited from the launches of its Delicia Drench Body Butter, new hair mist, and ""expansion of its distribution with a significant multi-brand partner in the US.""

Indeed, the group announced that within a week of the product’s exclusive launch at UK prestige beauty retailer Space NK, the Delicia Drench Body Butter was ""the no.1 SKU across the entire Space NK business with the highest rate of sale in store for a new product.""

Current vice chairman and CEO of the group, André Hoffmann, said the business now planned to continue to capitalise on Sol de Janeiro’s stellar popularity and growth​ and that it planned to “steadily expand its product and category range, and the scale and reach of its distribution.”

The British spa brand Elemis also returned to double-digit growth of 14.7% during the quarter after a “solid” trading period. The business said UK and US sales grew by 23.2% and 19.4% respectively.

Over the past year, the brand has undertaken an ongoing ‘premiumisation strategy’, which it said was intended to boost its “long-term profitability”.

Meanwhile, flagship brand L’Occitane en Provence, saw sales continue to struggle, with figures dropping by 2.9% during the holiday season.

The business noted that sales declined in EMEA, travel-retail sales also dropped, but that this was partially offset by an uptick in sales growth in China that “enabled us to maintain our growth momentum and relative outperformance in the premium beauty market in China and other key markets,” according to Hoffman.

The American market has been most lucrative for the business, with sales up 67.1% for the first three quarters of its financial year, mainly driven by Sol de Janeiro.

IN APAC, sales increased by 6.7% due to strong sales of both L’Occitane en Provence and Elemis in China.

L’Occitane also recently invested in the luxury home fragrance sector with the acquisition of​ Italian brand Dr. Vranjes Firenze as part of its strategy to “build a geographically balanced portfolio of premium beauty and fragrance brands.”

Hoffman said the business will also “further build on the healthy growth of other brands, including our recently acquired luxury home fragrance brand, Dr. Vranjes Firenze, to round out our portfolio.”

Overall, for the first full nine months of L’Occitane’s 2024 financial year, sales reached €1.9bn, up by 18.9% on the same period the previous year.

In early January, the business had also announced changes in its senior management team. As of 1st​ April 2024, the functions of group CEO and managing director are set to be combined into a single position, CEO, and the role will be assumed by Laurent Marteau, who will take over from André Hoffmann.

Beiersdorf ​

Beiersdorf’s results are set to be announced on 29th​ February 2024, so CosmeticsDesign-Europe will publish these separately.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

LVMH launches its new entertainment division: 22 Montaigne Entertainment - Luxus Plus,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vbHZtaC1sYXVuY2hlcy1pdHMtbmV3LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtZGl2aXNpb24tMjItbW9udGFpZ25lLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has just created 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a new division dedicated to entertainment. In collaboration with Superconnector Studios, the number-one luxury goods group aims to regain control over the stories associated with its 75 Houses, as well as catching up with rival Kering, whose presence in Hollywood was strengthened last summer.

With its new 22 Montaigne Entertainment division, LVMH is entering the world of Hollywood entertainment.

This new entity will have to find co-production opportunities or find a good way for the group to capitalize on the aura of its brands and control their image. But also to capitalize on the rise of video streaming, as well as on the general public’s craze for biopics and documentaries on SVOD platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple+, Disney+…).

This outspoken foray also enables LVMH to step on the toes of rival Kering, whose Maison Saint Laurent launched its film production studio last April. In the summer of 2023, through its holding company Artémis, LVMH acquired a majority stake in Hollywood’s most powerful talent agency, CAA (Creative Artist Agency).

A foothold in Hollywood

At a time when the major Hollywood studios are engaged in a merciless war to take back their catalogs from mainstream streaming platforms, and Universal Music has just terminated its catalog distribution agreement with the social network TikTok, LVMH is entering the entertainment race too.

On the eve of the French Césars ceremony (February 23) and the Oscars (March 11), and while Apple+ has just launched its The New Look series (on the early days of Christian Dior), the French luxury goods group has announced the creation of a new division entirely dedicated to entertainment : 22 Montaigne Entertainment. Its name evokes the address of the holding company’s headquarters as well as a Hollywood or South Korean studio, as k-pop imagery has been particularly present over the past year, including within the LVMH group’s Houses.

This new division’s mission will be to find opportunities for collaboration with creators, producers and distributors. It will also enable LVMH to co-create, co-produce and co-finance films, series, documentaries or podcasts… 22 Montaigne Entertainment is designed to showcase the personalities, employees and craftsmen behind the most iconic creations of its 75 Houses.

The aim is to build on the success of the documentary “Bvlgari Inside The Dream”, broadcast in around 100 countries in September 2022 on Amazon Prime Video, and to facilitate the production of memorable content linked to its strategic cultural assets.

Bernard Arnault, who owns Les Echos and Le Parisien, had already made a first attempt in 2021.

A hundred million euros to buy the newspaper of his birth…

According to Le Point, that’s how much Bernard Arnault is prepared to pay for the iconic weekly Paris Match. That’s almost double the magazine’s sales (52 million euros) in 2023. Bernard Arnault, as Le Point reminds us, was born in March 1949, the same month as Paris Match. Beyond the wink of an eye, this would be an opportunity for the billionaire to buy one of (the?) most popular and enduring magazines in France.

While the 100 million euro offer has not been confirmed, the existence of negotiations for the sale of Paris Match to Lvmh by the Lagardère group has been confirmed by both parties. Lagardère itself fell into the hands of the Vivendi group, owned by Vincent Bolloré, last November.

Exclusive discussions

Lagardère “has received a purchase offer for the Paris Match share from the LVMH group”, announced Lagardère on February 27, at the same time as its annual results. And its Board of Directors “has decided to enter into exclusive discussions” with the Number One in luxury goods.

Swiss watchmaker Hublot made its entrance on Alibaba Group’s e-commerce marketplace Tmall ahead of the Spring Festival and will ring in the Lunar New Year with a limited-edition dragon timepiece.

Last month, LVMH-owned brands Tiffany & Co. and Chaumet unveiled flagship stores on the platform, making Hublot the final major brand within the French luxury group’s stable of jewelry and watch businesses to do so.

The brand’s Tmall store offers over 100 watch models, including timepieces from its Big Bang, MP and Classic Fusion lines and several new additions unveiled last week at the LVMH Watch Week show in Miami.

Hublot creations range from simple rubber-strapped diving watches to elaborate diamond-covered multicolored designs.

To parse through the wide range of watches on offer, the brand’s Tmall store offers special services for users, who can stay ahead of special releases, collect loyalty points redeemable for gifts and more.

An automated chatbot named Beta also helps Hublot customers on Tmall by answering their questions and alerting shoppers to exclusive offerings.

“For LVMH Maisons, having this strong intimacy and strong interaction with customers to invent a personalized experience is absolutely critical. We believe that technology is able to bring us this unique opportunity,” Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH, said in a recent interview with Alizila.

Enter the Dragon

Since its founding in 1980, Hublot has earned a reputation for combining creativity with sharp engineering, resulting in highly functional pieces of wearable art.

The company continues this tradition with a limited-edition Spirit of Big Bang Titanium Dragon timepiece in collaboration with Guangzhou-based artist Chen Fenwan.

The watch design references traditional Chinese paper-cutting art through a multi-layered dragon pattern in magenta, purple and ivory hues and has a limited run of 88 pieces.

LVMH's chaumet unveils the medal designs for paris 2024 olympic and paralympic games - Designboom,"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL2Rlc2lnbi9sdm1oLWNoYXVtZXQtbWVkYWwtZGVzaWducy1wYXJpcy0yMDI0LW9seW1waWMtcGFyYWx5bXBpYy1nYW1lcy0wMi0wOC0yMDI0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Medal designs for paris 2024 olympic and paralympic games

LVMH’s French jeweler Chaumet designs and unveils the official medals for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The announcement followed the reveal of the games’ official torch designed by Mathieu Lehanneur which resembles a steel bat mimicking the rippling water in the Seine River. This time, Chaumet crafts the medal designs like a piece of jewelry. Each medal is forged using the original iron from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the first time in the history of medal-making for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Chaumet ties the links between heritage, sports, and jewelry-making, finding the creation of the medals inspired by three themes: hexagon, radiance, and setting. The Paris 2024 committee says that the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be the biggest event ever organized in France. The Olympic Games will take place from July 26th to August 11th, while the Paralympic Games will occur from August 28th to September 8th in Paris.

LVMH’s chaumet uses the original iron of eiffel tower

Flipping the Paris 2024 medals, LVMH’s Chaumet cuts the original iron of the Eiffel Tower into a hexagon and embeds the forged metal in the back of the award. Its geometric shape pays homage to the arches and slopes of the tower too, a recollection that the Olympic and Paralympic Games this year are staged in the French capital. Chaumet strips the iron of its Eiffel Tower brown paint to reveal its original color. In this way, the iron has been restored to its innate shade. The LVMH jeweler then places the hexagonal iron emblem in the center of the medal and engraves the insignia of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in the middle of it. All of the medals – gold, silver, and bronze – include these design elements, giving them a two-tone side and a complementary shade between the iron and the material.

Surrounding Chaumet’s medal design for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games are embossed lines that resemble the sun rays. These are the radiance influences that LVMH’s jeweler regarded too. They are created by pressing the metal to let the material bend and protrude, giving the medals a 3D look. These lines aren’t engraved like carving into wood but are impressed into the metal. Chaumet’s idea for this design is to symbolize the brightness or radiance of France during the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as if the rays were capturing the energy of the event. At the same time, these lines represent the vigor of the athletes, a reminder of their performances.

Aside from the pieces of the Eiffel Tower iron, the medals of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games have claws that lock the emblem in place, a traditional design approach by the House of Chaumet for its high jewelry creations. Six metal appendages are stamped on the surface and placed at the six corners of the hexagon to enclose the piece of iron against the medal. These claws are shaped like the Clous de Paris or the famous rivets on the Eiffel Tower. The athletes can see them as they scrutinize the medals, and these claws are made possible thanks to the concave shape of the iron too.

Bridging the similar themes between the Olympic and Paralympic Games became a goal for LVMH and Chaumet, yet introducing distinctive design elements all the while paying homage to Paris and the individual events whose visuals come up too. The rear of the medals is the same for all with the iron-forged emblem, but the front view tells a different story. For the Olympic Games medals, LVMH’s Chaumet revives the traditional Games in Greece back in the day. Looking at the medals, spikes form around the Paris 2024 Olympic Games medals, and the goddess of victory, Nike, is depicted in the middle of the award, a traditional figure on the medals since 2004.

Nike is blazing and running, emerging from and seemingly leaving the Panathenaic Stadium behind her, where the Olympic Games were revived in 1896. LVMH’s Chaumet links a past-and-present bridge between the Olympic Games in Paris and Greece. In the background of the medals, the Acropolis rises on the left of Nike, above the Panathenaic Stadium. On the other side, stands the Eiffel Tower, mirroring its level and position. The design approach of LVMH and Chaumet makes way for the reminiscent Games of Ancient Greece, the French origins of the modern Olympic Games, and the upcoming Paris 2024, all depicted and represented in the new Olympic Games medals.

For the Paralympic Games 2024 medals, LVMH and Chaumet chose the Eiffel Tower as the forefront image of the awards. It pictures the view from below the tower as if the athletes are looking up at the famous architecture. The choice by Chaumet and the Paris 2024 committee allows for a graphic representation of a low-angle view under the Eiffel Tower that invites the athletes to see or discover the Dame de fer from an unusual or little-represented angle. On the sides of the Paralympic Games medals, the inscription Paris 2024 is written in universal Braille, a script symbolizing accessibility and a reference to its French inventor Louis Braille. The official logo of the Paralympic Games 2024 is pressed in the middle of the medals, right between the view from below of the Eiffel Tower.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0

The Prize, one of fashion’s most important emerging designer competitions, is staging its 11th edition, having been first organised by the world’s number-one luxury group in 2014. This year, it received over 2,500 applications from around the world, compared to 2,400 last year, and has selected 20 labels from 18 countries to compete in the semi-final scheduled in Paris on February 29 and March 1. Between February 29 and March 5, the general public will be able to cast online votes to help a jury of experts pick the eight finalists.





The 22 designers of the 20 labels picked for the LVMH Prize semi-final - Prix LVMH



The competition is increasingly broadening its horizons. The semi-finalists include for the first time a designer from Togo, Jacques Agbobly, based in New York where he graduated from the School of Design and launched his Agbobly label in 2023, a Mexican designer, Patricio Campillo, with his menswear label Campillo, and one from Moldova, Fidan Novruzova.



European designers are well represented, making up nearly half of the shortlist with eight names, some of whom have already staged runways shows. Like Dutch artist-designer Duran Lantink, winner of the ANDAM special prize in 2023, and Marie Adam-Leenaerdt from Belgium, both showing their collections in Paris, while Italian designer Niccolò Pasqualetti and Swedish label Hodakova by Ellen Hodakova Larsson are included in the Parisian presentation calendar.

Pauline Dujancourt from France, Paolo Carzana from the UK, and Irish designer Michael Steward with his Standing Ground label, have previously shown their collections at . Bearing witness to the LVMH Prize’s rich cultural mix are Spanish-Chinese designer Yayi Chen Zhou, who set up her Ya Yi label in New York, and Yonathan Carmel from Israel, who presented his Vautrait label last September during .



Asia is represented by ChiaHung Su, the label by Taiwanese designer Chia Hung Su, Jiyongkim by Korean designer Jiyong Kim, and Koki by Japanese designer Koki Abe, and by genderless label Ponder.er by Chinese duo Alex Po and Derek Cheng, which the French Fashion and Haute Couture Federation has backed for several seasons via the Sphère showroom.





Urban influences, refined womenswear





The shortlist is completed by three US labels - Who Decides War by the Everard Best and Tela D’Amore Best duo, and Elena , both showing in New York, and Aubero by Julian Louie - and by the label of London-based Brazilian designer Karoline Vitto, who is showing in London.



“This edition is characterised by original propositions with a strong urban influence, and by a return to refined womenswear. Many of these labels have placed research and aesthetics at the heart of their approach, echoing the new Prix des Savoir-Faire,” said in a press release , one of the LVMH Prize’s masterminds, adding that she is expecting an “exceptional 2024 edition.”



The newly created Prix des Savoir-Faire will reward technical expertise, and is endowed with a €200,000 purse. The other prizes awarded at the final are the LVMH Prize, worth €400,000 as opposed to €300,000 in 2023, and the Prize, whose value will also increase, from €150,000 last year to €200,000. In both cases, the winners will benefit from a one-year mentoring by the luxury group’s staff. LVMH will also recognise, as usual, three recent fashion academy graduates.

That came courtesy of the novelties of course, but also the spate of fresh CEO appointments.

“This is a great moment for all our brands to come together, to show the strength and ambition of the LVMH group – and such an important category in the luxury world,” Frédéric Arnault said at the event’s opening cocktail. In January, Arnault was promoted to CEO of LVMH Watches, overseeing Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith. Previously CEO of TAG Heuer, he has been succeeded by Julien Tornare, who since 2017 has spearheaded the runaway success of Zenith, while Benoit de Clerck joins from Richemont Group as Zenith CEO.

As the maison presented their latest novelties (including a few Watches and Wonders sneak peeks), what certainly felt palpable across the group was a kind of global upgrade and desire to reposition LVMH as a high-end watchmaker – channelling the “strength and ambition” that Arnault had alluded to.

Here are three key trends and takeaways from this year’s LVMH Watch Week Miami:

Haute horlogerie

Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth naturally led the event’s wow pieces. With the duality of these brands, La Fabrique du Temps’s legendary co-founding watchmakers, Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini, seem to have really hit a dream moment in their esteemed careers. Navas said that Genta, as a designer, was full of ideas – like juxtaposing playful Mickey Mouse with serious haute horlogerie – while Roth was very easy to understand. “We are watchmakers, so when we went to Mr Roth’s house [to meet him], there was no need to talk so much. We understand what he wants,” recalled Mr Navas. On one end is charm and delight – courtesy of a golf-club swinging Donald Duck animated on a dial combining retrograde minutes, jumping hour and a minute repeater, all set in Genta’s signature eight-sided case. The other end sees history recast, in the Daniel Roth Souscription Tourbillon that revives Roth’s first tourbillon created as a souscription for Asprey in 1988.

Hublot also presented its six-figure haute horlogerie piece, the MP-10. Hublot’s Manufacture Piece collection is always highly anticipated for its boundary-pushing ideas, and this daring design does not disappoint: with no hands, dial or rotor, the automatic movement is powered by two linear weights, complete with an inclined tourbillon.

Gemset watches

Furthering the high-end brief are some noteworthy gem-set watchces, headlined by Zenith. The maison has long shunned such obvious embellishment for more purist watchmaking, which makes the new Chronomaster Sport so eye-catching. A gem-set bezel dazzles with three colours to match the signature tri-colour face: baguette-cut blue sapphires, black and grey spinels are paired with diamonds at the hours. Topping it off is a golden, textured meteorite dial, to play off the rose gold case and bracelet.

An air of sustainability – and disruption - came from TAG Heuer’s latest lab-grown diamond watch, the Carrera Date Plasma Diamant d’Avant-Garde. After coming in white and pink diamonds in recent years, yellow diamond now joins the line up, with a crown fashioned entirely in the stone, and a matching shield-shape yellow diamond on the gem-encrusted dial. Elsewhere, more precious finishes were added to the TAG Heuer Aquaracer collection with Solargraph technology – from a gemset bezel to a grained, Tiffany-blue like dial. And despite a new mother-of-pearl face, there’s no compromise on the full 10-month running of the watch after a 48-hour charge, from either artificial or natural light.

Finally, Bulgari marked 10 years of its feminine and precious Lucea line with an unusual dial crafted in upcycled malachite fragments, which it likely has aplenty as a jeweller. Set mosaic like, the perfect-puzzled workmanship is much harder than it looks, noted head designer Fabrizio Buonamassa Stigliani, who has never shied away from a design challenge.

Play on complications

Complementing the high watchmaking but low-volume designs at Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth is a focus on mechanical watchmaking at Zenith and TAG Heuer. As you’d expect, Zenith’s new Triple Calendar has an authentic dose of horological history, namely its ties to the original 1969 El Primero. After coming as a prototype in 1970 of just 25 pieces for the watchmakers – and later commercialised in an avant-garde, futuristic case – the Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar is now produced as originally intended, coming in the model’s bestselling white dial, alongside grey or the boutique-only green.

TAG Heuer meanwhile expanded upon its “glassbox” Carrera Chronograph that marked the model’s 60th anniversary last year – and which builds upon the graphic good looks and clear legibility that made the original Carrera such a winner. A racing-green inspired teal has been introduced, paired with a new chronograph mono sub-dial configuration that recalls the brand’s pared back Dato layout of 1968. A tourbillon version of the chronograph, set at the six o’clock, also gets the new teal treatment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9470647573471069}",neutral,0.9470647573471069,0
LVMH buys a new building in Paris - Luxus Plus,"Mon, 05 Feb 2024 14:10:39 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vbHZtaC1idXlzLWEtbmV3LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWluLXBhcmlzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Located between the Opéra and Place Vendôme, the new mansion acquired by the world’s number one luxury brand could house a luxury jewelry hotel and private salons for Louis Vuitton.

Next to Bernard Arnault, CEO of Lvmh, Cadet Roussel and its three houses are like a real estate dwarf!

After two major acquisitions on the Champs Elysées (101 and 150 in June and December 2023) and 25 rue Jean Goujon (eighth arrondissement), according to specialist media CFNEWS Immo, the French luxury giant has just acquired a new prestigious asset. According to rumors, the group has paid 30,000 euros per square meter to acquire the Hôtel Soltykoff, located at 10 rue Volney, in the 2nd arrondissement, representing a value of 55 million euros for this 1,800 m2 property.

Admittedly, this mid-19th century mansion, a blend of French and Venetian architecture, is one-tenth the size of the aforementioned buildings on the Champs Elysées. And although Lvmh has not confirmed its purchase, it would nonetheless be of major strategic interest.

Haute joaillerie Louis Vuitton

In the heart of the world’s most important high-end jewelry district, between the Opéra and Place Vendôme, it would be the ideal setting for a future haute joaillerie atelier for Louis Vuitton, complete with private salons.

"From gold medals to wardrobes, Paris Olympics to spotlight French luxury - FRANCE 24 English","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyNDAyMTMtcGFyaXMtb2x5bXBpY3Mtc2V0LWZvci1nb2xkLW1lZGFsLWluLWx1eHVyeS1wcm9tb3Rpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From the podium to athletes' wardrobes, French luxury goods giant LVMH is planning to put high-end Gallic chic at the heart of the Paris Olympics, underlining how sport has become a promotional platform for even the most exclusive brands.

Parisian luxury jewellery house Chaumet, one of LVMH's lesser-known properties, was thrust into the public limelight on Thursday when its design for the medals for the July 26-August 11 extravaganza was unveiled.

The role was a departure from its usual niche making engagement rings, tiaras and diamond-studded broaches for the ultra-wealthy, with LVMH hoping to harness the huge international reach of the Olympics on home turf.

Antoine Arnault, senior LVMH executive and eldest son of company founder Bernard Arnault, said at the ceremony to reveal the medals that there was a ""quasi-military organisation inside the company"" working on Paris Olympics projects.

""LVMH as a partner will try to add a little touch of creativity, notably during the moments of celebration,"" he told reporters.

Controlled by the world's richest man, Bernard Arnault, LVMH signed up as ""premium partner"" for the Paris Games in July last year after months of complex negotiations about the use of its brands.

While Chaumet secured the medal honour, high-end leather goods brand Berluti is set to dress the French athletes during the spectacular opening ceremony being planned on the river Seine on July 26.

Thousands of Olympics VIPs and high-paying corporate guests are set to sip LVMH-owned Moet & Chandon champagne as well as Hennessy cognac among other premium drinks in their hospitality suites.

Dior is also set for a role -- which has not yet been announced -- as is celebrated handbag and luggage maker Louis Vuitton.

A series of LVMH-sponsored sports ambassadors will help promote the brand on social media, with 21-year-old French swimming medal hope Leon Marchand one of the earliest names revealed.

Luxurious sports

LVMH has declined to make public how much it is contributing to the 4.4-billion-euro ($4.7 billion) organising budget of the Games.

A source close to the negotiations told AFP at the time that it was worth around 150 million euros ($160 million) -- around one percent of the record 15.2 billion euros in net profit posted by the group last year.

Commenting on why LVMH took so long negotiating its deal with the Paris organisation, Antoine Arnault explained in July that the company ""didn't want to just be a financial partner. We wanted to have a role to play in the holding of these Olympic Games.""

LVMH is the world's biggest luxury goods giant, with brands across fashion, jewellery, perfume, alcohol and luggage that trade on France's centuries-old reputation as a centre of taste-making and artistry.

""France and Paris are such a potent association for luxury brands, it's kind of a no-brainer for LVMH to want to be as involved as they can be,"" said Robert Williams, luxury editor at The Business of Fashion, a specialist fashion publisher.

Sports were ""a space where brands have been ramping up significantly in recent years"".

""You have the TV viewership of sporting events, which makes it a really good placement opportunity, plus the fact that sporting events have become more luxurious,"" he told AFP.

""Paris will be the centre of the world for a few weeks,"" agreed Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at the Bernstein Autonomous investment research group.

""Sport is one of the very few 'global languages' available for brands to communicate to all people in the world without the risk of a faux pas,"" he told AFP.

'Income inequality'

While helping reach new audiences internationally, LVMH's role also has a strong domestic dimension in helping promote the company to French people as a socially responsible corporation, Williams added.

Bernard Arnault's fortune -- estimated at around $200 billion (185.5 billion euros) by Forbes -- and LVMH's huge profits frequently draw criticism in a country strongly attached to wealth redistribution.

""In recent years, they've made a real effort to make sure that people see them in a favourable light because you have a lot of tensions around income inequality,"" Williams said.

Part of that effort is being seen to ""keep alive certain elements of French craftsmanship,"" he said.

The Lausanne-based International Olympic Committee has a range of global sponsors ranging from Coca-Cola to Toyota, leading some critics to argue that the modern Olympics have become tainted by corporate money.

Many leading French companies have signed up as local partners with the Paris organisers, with a notable exception: oil group TotalEnergies, which was vigorously opposed by Paris' eco-minded mayor, Anne Hidalgo.

On Tuesday evening, in sync with the release of its annual earnings, the Lagardère group revealed that it has entered into exclusive negotiations with LVMH for Paris Match, following the luxury group’s offer for the French people magazine. Financial terms of a possible deal were not disclosed.

More from WWD

The publishing group’s board of directors earlier in the day had decided to move forward with the exclusive talks.

LVMH already owns French daily newspapers Le Parisien and Les Echos. It is also a shareholder in Lagardère.

Lagardère in November 2023 was acquired by Vivendi, which is controlled by the Bolloré family. Prior to that, last year, Vivendi sold another people magazine — Gala — to Groupe Figaro in order to meet European Commission requirements to purchase Lagardère.

"LVMH, Prada, Richemont join Web3's Paris takeover - Jing Daily","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXByYWRhLXJpY2hlbW9udC1qb2luLXdlYjMtcy1wYXJpcy10YWtlb3ZlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, ground zero of luxury, is also emerging as a hotbed of Web3 innovation. Last week, timed to align with the fashion month circuit, tech arbiters rallied to the city to host a quadriptych of digital fashion symposiums: Digital Fashion Week, Future+, Future Fashion Summit, and the annual NFT Paris.

With speakers from Prada, Aura Blockchain Consortium, Dior, and LVMH in tow this season, the events have evolved from a crypto bros knees-up to high-profile platforms that dissect the future of Web3 and its impact on the fashion industry.

These citywide summits are prime time for brands old and new to show off their innovations to the high-fashion posse.

“They not only facilitate connections with pioneers and influencers in the Web3 domain, but also play a crucial role in advancing the digital fashion landscape,” digital fashion house and NFT Paris attendee Nextberries tells Jing Daily.

Here are the key takeaways and notable activations of the week.

Experts from across the board agreed that wider Web3 adoption depends on the tech specifics fading into the background and a pivot in focus. When it comes to traditional luxury consumers, the underlying tech is often an afterthought, not the selling point – something that Web3 brands need to consider when courting the style-savvy.

For instance, more brands are integrating Digital Product Passports (DPP) into their products. Accelerated by looming EU legislation on product traceability, brands have become more accepting of the tech as an answer to circularity, but remain hesitant to admit that it’s powered by the blockchain.

Digital passports were a hot topic during the Future Fashion Summit, says the conference founder and CEO of Web3 advisory agency Hollywoodlabs.io, Holly Wood, with experts from EON and Arianee dissecting the multi application use-case of DPP’s, “from regulatory requirements, to adding value to goods by attaching experiences, like [with] the Balenciaga exclusive music hoodie,” she says.

Nick Adler, co-founder of Web3-infused label Mntge, believes that bringing fashion on chain with DPPs and near-field communication (NFC) chips shouldn’t exclude traditional consumers, who often lack the technological understanding needed to navigate systems powered by Web3. For ease and convenience, a ‘tap in’ approach is seen as the most seamless route to adoption.

“The blockchain gives us an amazing blank canvas to really dig into these garments and add new capabilities and information to them, so that you can just tap the chip and you know where your garment came from,” Adler adds.

The past year has seen a concerted effort from enthusiasts to swing the Web3 pendulum after high-profile disasters in the crypto sector (such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraud conviction and Bored Ape Yacht Club’s market crash) dented public enthusiasm for the tech.

Circumventing the crypto bro trope, creators are moving away from PFP-heavy, cartoon monkey aesthetics to more subtle, if-you-know-you-know characteristics in their designs.

9dcc, for instance, is investing heavily in cultivating a business that’s taken seriously as a legitimate fashion label. Catering to what 9dcc founder and NFT collector Gmoney describes as the ‘crypto mob’ – think the next iteration of ‘tech nerds’ like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk – the luxury Web3 label is designing clothes that acknowledge the largely misunderstood crypto crowd and its members’ style preferences.

“This emerging aspirational demographic is completely overlooked by traditional luxury brands,” says Gmoney. “Despite the luxury market’s fleeting fascination with the crypto community’s purchasing power, skepticism remains high, often linking blockchain technologies with nefarious activities.”

For its initial collections, 9dcc used caps, t-shirts, and accessories as a low-risk entry point to gauge the consumer response and demand before committing to more outlandish apparel. Following a series of well-received drops, for its recent launch, the brand expanded into new categories, creating patterned denim co-ord sets, trench coats, and leather gilets. Like before, each networked product is embedded with its own NFC-chip. But the tech is no longer the garments’ sole selling point. It’s the designs that are the crowd-pleasers.

At the forefront of the crypto fashion vanguard, Gmoney believes that luxury’s disregard of the demographic offers a “golden highway” to Web3-native brands.

“Our goal was to make them feel empowered,” he adds. This season, the platform also moved away from its token-gated strategy, instead opting for a more accessible and “inclusive” e-commerce system. “We want to make sure our luxury items are available to a wider range of aficionados, especially those intrigued by the ways emerging technologies are enhancing the convenience factor,” Gmoney says.

Over the past 12 months, the Web3 ecosystem has borne witness to significant changes – from the rise of artificial intelligence and experiential retail, to the NFT market backslide. But, outside of the echo chamber, widespread ambivalence remains.

Emerging technology – with AI being an exception – has often struggled to translate to the wider fashion industry. While the Web3 community has grown, it’s a cohort that has remained largely siloed.

At the Future Fashion Summit, founder Wood focused on merging the cultural spheres of tech proponents and the fashion cognoscenti by joining forces with revered fashion media publication 10 Magazine. With almost 1 million followers on Instagram, the media channel is a household name among style evangelists, helping drive more conventional consumers to the Web3 realm. “To have their backing is a major move forward,” she says.

Meanwhile, Future Fashion Summit attendee Mntge banked on the endorsement of legacy denim brand Wrangler to amplify its presence. The two share a lot of common ground, says co-founder Adler, adding that the partnership “just made sense.” While established brands can offer emerging Web3 businesses a leg-up, next-generation spearheaders can in-turn encourage existing brands to “push the envelope of what traditional fashion has been able to do,” Adler adds.

Brands have been engineering a strong Web3 comeback following dampened excitement around the tech over the past few years. And it looks to be paying off.

“Fashion is starting to feel more confident to explore new tech,” Wood says, with an improved sense of cohesive direction spurring more people to join the tech wave. And Paris, the City of Light – now also leading-edge technology – is cementing itself as the place to do exactly that.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999536275863647}",neutral,0.9999536275863647,0
Paris: Givenchy and Off-White - an LVMH double header - us.fashionnetwork.com,"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdXMuZmFzaGlvbm5ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvUGFyaXMtZ2l2ZW5jaHktYW5kLW9mZi13aGl0ZS1hbi1sdm1oLWRvdWJsZS1oZWFkZXIsMTYxMDI1OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris: Givenchy and Off-White - an LVMH double header By



Godfrey Deeny Published

Feb 29, 2024

Two brands staged shows on a rainy Thursday in Paris - and – where the art of editing, or not, a collection was at the heart of the matter in both shows.





Off-White: An American in Paris

A packed , with thousands of fans braving the rain outside to catch a glimpse of stars from the black nomenklatura entering the latest Off-White show.



Serena Williams caused a paparazzi and influencer feeding frenzy, as she entered to join Rich the and Tina Kunakey underneath the Louvre Museum. Like celebrities on display, they all sat on low circular disks built on the shows stage. Joining uber supes like Toni Garrn and Alessandra Ambrosio in front of two huge silver dice, the better to be admired by the front row of editors, critics and executives.

Designed by Ibrahim Kamara, this Off-White collection was a homage to black American influence on our global culture, and the result was a kicky display of friendly fashion.



Kamara could be perhaps faulted for lacking a self-editing button. He attached multiple pockets; mock cummerbunds; strings; holsters both for cowboys and carpenter; drawstrings and straps to many looks. Though, once again, the results had plenty of kick and punch.



Ibrahim also played around with the Off-White DNA, mostly with the quadruple arrow logo – seen on the back or heart of baseball jackets or embossed on some great saddle stitched totes. All good brand building.

In a co-ed show, the Off-White guy turned out to be more a poet than a dude. Favoring pink cardigans, lilac denim pants and endless looks in lime. Though there were also quite a few rapper trappers with faux furry Klondike hats. While one chap, the size of a linebacker, wore star covered monogram gangster pants over a matching handbag, with a baseball jacket on whose back an evil goblin was putting a spell on two dice.



Ironically for a gent who rose to fame as a fashion stylish with Dazed magazine, Kamara might think of hiring a new one of his own.



Before a driving finale with the entire cast surging around to Beyoncé song Bootylicious, winning Kamara an impressively loud cheer.



There is life it appears at Off-White after the passing of its noble founder Virgil Abloh.





Givenchy: Commercial committee collection

Givenchy bade farewell to its most recent designer – American-born Matthew Williams a few months ago and since then its menswear show in January and its women’s collection this season have been designed by a studio team.



Well, this collection looked very Givenchy – from the opening soirée looks to the feathered bride in pearly gray at the finale.



The drawbacks and the virtues of a committee were evident in this show, especially the latter. Whoever led the design team has pretty good handle on what Givenchy stood for – a polished Parisian look with layers of sophistication.



Created almost entirely in black, gray and white, it featured metallic gray cocktails; smartly rouched jet black leather cocktails finished with bows; or posh dominatrix corsets.

Its tailoring was strong – from anthracite jacquard mannish redingotes with trains, worn with matching shorts, to crisp Harris tweed style board member suits.



Faintly gothic, and always quite tough chic, for a collection whose goal is to keep business ticking over in Givenchy boutiques until a new designer arrives, this was pretty darn good.



Staged inside the brands historic HQ on Avenue George V, the show also marked the first since the appointment of as President of the LVMH fashion group. In an active day, Burke could catch two of his brands - Off-White and Givenchy – both in reasonably good health.



His next big decision: cast a new creative director for Givenchy. Which is what made the choice of opening song on the soundtrack – the distorted anthem Bela Lugois’s Dead – so perfect. For the tune is about the greatest interpreter of Dracula retiring from the part, but ultimately being unable to ever give up the role.



They say, never quite got over selling out early to LVMH and watching iconoclastic designers like and wrought what he thought of as havoc on his brand. So, if he is looking down at this collection he will probably be reassured by its respectful homage. Besides, unlike Bela, Hubert was able to retire.
