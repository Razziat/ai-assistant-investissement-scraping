Marc Jacobs and Bernard Arnault: A Timeline - NBC New York,"Wed, 24 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3lvcmsuY29tL2xvY2FsL3RocmVhZC1tYXJjLWphY29icy1hbmQtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LzE5MjY5NjMv0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3eW9yay5jb20vbG9jYWwvdGhyZWFkLW1hcmMtamFjb2JzLWFuZC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQvMTkyNjk2My8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With rumors flying that Marc Jacobs is about to take the helm at Christian Dior, here's an in-depth look at the designer's often-tumultuous relationship with his boss Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH (the parent company of both Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, where Jacobs is currently Artistic Director). While Jacobs has often made digs at his boss in the press, their relationship appears to have softened in recent years.

1990: Bernard Arnault seizes control of the LVMH empire in a hostile takeover.

1996: Arnault begins talks with Marc Jacobs, trying to match him with one of the fashion houses within LVMH. During the '90s, Arnault also placed Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, John Galliano at Dior and Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe.

1997: Marc Jacobs and his longtime business partner Robert Duffy sign on as Artistic Director and Studio Director, respectively, of Louis Vuitton. Arnault hires Jacobs to not only revive the centuries-old leather business, but to launch the first-ever line of clothing for the label. He also makes a $140,000 investment in Jacobs’ namesake label. (Today, LVMH owns 96 percent of Marc Jacobs International, the holding company and one-third a stake in the trademark.) It is rumored that Vogue editor Anna Wintour played a large role in the placement of Jacobs at the label. Arnault later tells WSJ. in 2011: ""She pointed us towards unexpected choices, I speak very openly to her, and this was quite audacious -- it was not about picking the big names of the moment.”

2001: Jacobs renews his contract with LVMH for an additional five years.

2004: Jacobs tells the Wall Street Journal, ""I think Gucci treated Tom Ford better than LVMH has treated me."" The same year, Duffy and Jacobs renew their contract with LVMH after a year of negotiations. A sticking point of the negotiations was the duos' personal salaries, which were both under a million dollars at the time, and the investment LVMH was making in Jacobs' signature line. After signing the deal, : Jacobs tells the Wall Street Journal, ""I think Gucci treated Tom Ford better than LVMH has treated me."" The same year, Duffy and Jacobs renew their contract with LVMH after a year of negotiations. A sticking point of the negotiations was the duos' personal salaries, which were both under a million dollars at the time, and the investment LVMH was making in Jacobs' signature line. After signing the deal, Jacobs tells WWD : ""I'm not a controlling or director-like person. I'm good at participating in a group. I'm good at making things and I love working with Vuitton, but at a certain point, I got tired of this image of us with a tin cup in our hands, saying, 'Please sir, can I have some more?' That whole Oliver Twist routine was getting so tired.""

2007: Jacobs tells New York Magazine in regards to Arnault , “In so many ways, I’ve always felt like this little boy trying to please a father.” Jacobs also reveals: “Chanel would be the scariest job in the world to get, but it would also be the coup de grâce. I’d be scared to death and thrilled, but it’s the only thing I’d love to do other than what I’m doing right now. If that’s all that’s left, then that’s not such a bad thing. Karl’s [Lagerfeld] the perfect person for the job, and he’s not going anywhere, but if there’s anything that tickles me behind the ear every once in a while, that’s it. That’s the only, the ultimate, thing.""

2010: , ""I used to say in the beginning that I was like the pig in Babe when the farmer, who was not wildly emotional, expressed himself in a super-warm way. Mr. Arnault does not express himself in a super-warm way, but he has softened up -- I am that pig and he pats me on the back and says, 'That'll do pig', and I just feel this is the highest praise."" Jacobs tells Vogue UK , ""I used to say in the beginning that I was like the pig in Babe when the farmer, who was not wildly emotional, expressed himself in a super-warm way. Mr. Arnault does not express himself in a super-warm way, but he has softened up -- I am that pig and he pats me on the back and says, 'That'll do pig', and I just feel this is the highest praise.""

January 2011: Arnault tells Tatler Asia , ""I could have asked many other talented designers to do Dior, but it would not have been the same. Take Marc Jacobs, he has been a fantastic success at Vuitton and he has a proximity to the Vuitton spirit, but I don't think it would have been a success with Jacobs at Dior and the other way around, if I had asked John [Galliano] to do Vuitton, it would not have worked. An essential ingredient in the success of the brand today is the real proximity of Galliano to the talent of Christian Dior."" Less than two months later, Galliano is fired from Dior for making anti-Semitic slurs."
Marc Jacobs in talks to succeed John Galliano as head of Christian Dior - New York Daily News,"Mon, 22 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDExLzA4LzIyL21hcmMtamFjb2JzLWluLXRhbGtzLXRvLXN1Y2NlZWQtam9obi1nYWxsaWFuby1hcy1oZWFkLW9mLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marc Jacobs might be packing up his Louis Vuitton suitcases.

The fashion designer, 48, who runs two eponymous lines as well as Vuitton, is rumored to be the top contender to take over for disgraced designer John Galliano at the helm of legendary fashion house Christian Dior.

According to Women’s Wear Daily, sources close to the discussions have said Jacobs is in talks with Bernard Arnault, CEO of the luxury brand’s behemoth LVMH which owns Marc Jacobs, Celine, Fendi, Vuitton, Dior and more, regarding the job. If he does take the high-profile position, he would likely give up his perch at Vuitton but continue working on his own lines.

DRESS FOR EXCESS: FASHION’S MOST OUT THERE CHARACTERS



The move does make sense from a business standpoint.

Jacobs already runs a number of successful lines for LVMH, so it would make sense to trust him with the Dior brand. And competition might not be as fierce as early speculation would have had us believe.

According to British Elle, other top names including Alexander McQueen‘s Sarah Burton, who designed Kate Middleton‘s dress for the royal wedding, and Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquiere have already taken themselves out of the running.

WHO COULD WEAR THAT? CRAZY COUTURE

Rumors that Jacobs was a contender for the position surfaced in July, but were not considered to be serious. With Monday’s report in WWD, that may all change.

“One source cautioned that a deal with Jacobs is not assured,” notes WWD, “but that the American designer and Dior management are so far ‘excited’ about the prospect.”

Considering Jacobs’ legions of adoring fans, they’re certainly not the only ones who are excited."
LVMH in Fashion JV with India's Genesis Luxury - iDiva.com,"Wed, 10 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkaXZhLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2hvdy10by9sdm1oLWluLWZhc2hpb24tanYtd2l0aC1pbmRpYXMtZ2VuZXNpcy1sdXh1cnkvNjg5OdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(L-R) Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH and Sanjay Kapoor, MD of Genesis Luxury.

In a move that underlines the growing global appeal for Indian apparel, L Capital Asia, the private equity arm of the world's largest luxury conglomerate LVMH Group, and Groupe Arnault is forming a 50:50 joint venture with Genesis Luxury Fashion to showcase ethnic haute couture.



The companies together are in talks to invest about Rs 80 crore initially, a person with direct knowledge of the development, according to an Economic Times report. ""While L Capital Asia will bring in its knowledge and help create a multi-brand system, Genesis will focus on retail distribution and infrastructure,"" the person said.



The JV will act as a platform to promote and showcase work of budding designers besides established ones like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Rohit Bal and Tarun Tahiliani.



Ravi Thakran, managing partner of L Capital Asia, said, ""We are in the process of talking to designers who share our vision for creating a national footprint through a scalable business model. The products should have a distinct identity that resonates with the Indian ethos."" He, however, declined to comment on the investment details of the JV firm.



Sanjay Kapoor, MD of Genesis Luxury, was not available for comment. Industry insiders say that with rising consumerism in the country, the designer and luxury fashion wear segment is increasingly attracting investor interest in the country.



The Story So Far

Last month, L Capital Asia acquired a 25.5 per cent stake in Genesis Luxury for about Rs 100 crore and has plans to pick up another additional 14.5 per cent stake in the company in the coming months. Established in 2008, Genesis Luxury is the group company of the privately held Genesis Colors, bringing together a diverse range of brands from top-end men's wear to travel accessories and bags, among others.



It has leading luxury brands, including Satya Paul, Canali, Paul Smith, Just Cavalli and Jimmy Choo, among others. While LVMH focuses exclusively on high-end luxury goods such as Louis Vuitton and Dior in its portfolio, L Capital has been investing in aspirational and luxury goods makers all over the world.



The fund, which has a corpus of $640 million plans to invest across segments in India, including lifestyle retail, consumer brands, beauty & wellness and hospitality. It is the fourth fund from L Capital and has already invested in a few companies in Asia.



Among other private equity transactions sealed in the luxury fashion wear segment, Franklin Templeton Private Equity Strategy acquired a 20 per cent stake in Kimaya Fashions for about Rs 60 crore, valuing the Mumbai-based designer wear retailer at Rs 300 crore.
