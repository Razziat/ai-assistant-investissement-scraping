LVMH Faces Fine After Brawl With Hermes in Luxury Aisle - CNBC,"Fri, 31 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTMvMDUvMzEvbHZtaC1mYWNlcy1maW5lLWFmdGVyLWJyYXdsLXdpdGgtaGVybWVzLWluLWx1eHVyeS1haXNsZS5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTMvMDUvMzEvbHZtaC1mYWNlcy1maW5lLWFmdGVyLWJyYXdsLXdpdGgtaGVybWVzLWluLWx1eHVyeS1haXNsZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Regulator AMF said Friday that LVMH's dealings in building its position in Hermes were opaque and represented grave misconduct that could be regarded as ""fraudulent behavior.""

The owners have fought Arnault tooth and nail, however, since discovering that LVMH had built up an initial 14 percent stake.

France's wealthiest man, Arnault has built LVMH into the world's largest luxury group by buying other brands over the last decade. He has said he is happy to remain a long-term shareholder, but some industry observers say he may be playing a long game in the hope of persuading Hermes' family owners to sell out.

The fight centers on deals, first disclosed in late 2010, by LVMH owner Bernard Arnault that have left the company with a roughly one-fifth stake in Hermes, its biggest competitor and producer of the iconic Kelly and Birkin handbags.

A battle between French luxury-handbag makers went public Friday, with regulators seeking the maximum fine for Louis Vuitton owner LVMH for failing to disclose moves to build a stake in rival Hermes .

LVMH, which now owns 22.6 percent of Hermes, surprised the stock market in October 2010, announcing that it had a 14 percent stake, gained partly via derivatives that allowed it to not declare its holding.

The regulator said that LVMH should have disclosed the size of its exposure to Hermes shares through equity derivatives acquired in 2008, as well as that it had a stake of just under 5 percent acquired in 2001 and 2002.

In France, companies are required to disclose when they take a stake worth more than 5, 10 and 15 percent of a company's capital if the target is listed on the stock market.

Hermes is also challenging LVMH's stake-building in a separate court procedure. The AMF finding will not have any impact on the court case but represents a boost to Hermes.

The amount of the fine, 10 million euros ($13.05 million), is small change to a group with market value of about 70 billion euros, but the regulator's decision is a public relations setback for Arnault, who owns some 60 luxury brands.

Hermes' Attraction

Arnault owns Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest luxury brand in revenue, and a collection of fine wine and spirits makers, including Hennessy cognac and Moet & Chandon Champagne.

He has built the group into a global powerhouse in the space of 15 years by acquiring brands including Guerlain and Chateau d'Yquem. Hermes' spectacular growth into a brand with more than 3 billion euros in annual sales has whetted his appetite.

The hearing revealed that LVMH had as early as 2007 and 2008 mandated Lazard and Rothschild bankers to look into acquiring control of Hermes and to strike an alliance with some family shareholders.

Since making its Hermes holding public, LVMH has consistently denied seeking control and denied any wrongdoing in financial disclosure or transparency.

Hermes is controlled by three families (the Puech, Dumas and Guerrand), who together represent more than 75 descendants of Emile Hermes, who founded the company in 1837 as a harness and saddlemaker.

They responded to LVMH's buildup by creating a holding that controls 51 percent of Hermes, though the AMF inquiry also uncovered that the biggest Hermes family shareholder, Nicolas Puech, had sold some of his shares to LMVH. That calls into question Hermes' public assertion of a united front in the battle.

Earlier on Friday, the AMF said it would look into LVMH's call to invalidate the judicial process but it would not halt the process. The regulator's sanctions committee is slated to respond within a matter of weeks to the inquiry's findings and proposed fine."
LVMH Rushes To Keep Up With China's Changing Tastes - Jing Daily,"Mon, 27 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXJ1c2hlcy10by1rZWVwLXVwLXdpdGgtY2hpbmFzLWNoYW5naW5nLXRhc3Rlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fan Bingbing poses with a logo-free version of Louis Vuitton's Alma bag.

According to a new Financial Times article, several experts believe that LVMH's less-than-impressive first-quarter growth numbers are due to the fact that the company underestimated the rate at which Chinese tastes would shift away from logo-heavy designs toward more understated looks.

When the conglomerate recently reported its first-quarter growth rate of three percent, the low number sparked industry worries that China's slowdown may be hitting luxury harder than anyone had predicted. However, as results from other luxury brands continued to roll in, it became clear that LVMH had performed much more poorly than others who saw less dramatic growth declines.

The article cites several reasons for the conglomerate's lagging China growth, all of which relate back to Chinese customers' evolving tastes.

First of all, Louis Vuitton's status as a ""mega-brand"" may actually be hurting it as demand shifts toward more niche labels. According to the article,

The risk for mega-brands, say analysts at HSBC, is of “ubiquity – the idea that the consumer seeing the same products everywhere starts to perceive a brand as being ‘too common’. In our view, the main victims of this theme are Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Gucci as customers from developed economies and even Chinese [principal] cities are less eager to buy logo products.”

Further exacerbating the issue was the fact that LVMH did not respond to this trend quickly enough, as opposed to rival PPR, which has successfully introduced Bottega Veneta to the Chinese market to make up for Gucci's slow growth.

Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, likens the moves to the multi-layered strategy pursued by Mercedes, which introduced top-end and lower-end models around its mainstream E-class car.







The question is “will sophisticated consumers prefer to buy higher-end versions of mega-brands like LV in the future? Or will they rather buy ‘pure’ higher-end, niche brands like Hermès?” he asks.







Niche brands have grown strongly, including Goyard, PPR’s Bottega Veneta and LVMH’s Céline. Mr Arnault told shareholders that Céline was not on “the radar” five years ago but joked that now his daughter, Delphine, often sported the brand, despite her supposed allegiance to LVMH’s Christian Dior, where she is a director.







The problem, says Mr Solca, is that LVMH did not groom Céline to take over the relay from Louis Vuitton sooner, unlike PPR’s Bottega Veneta which has been growing strongly for a number of years, as the upmarket alternative to its Gucci brand.

The company is taking responsive action by limiting store numbers and introducing logo-free designs. In January, Louis Vuitton commissioned brand ambassador Fan Bingbing to promote a new set of ""China-exclusive"" leather, logo-free handbags that are dramatically different from the company's signature canvas logo style. In addition, its number of planned store openings has been scaled down in order to maintain exclusivity.

According to the article, the company is confident that its new strategies will pay off. “At the risk of shocking everyone, the [rate of] sales growth at Louis Vuitton is not a problem,” said LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault at a shareholders' meeting, stating that slow growth was part of the company's ""deliberate strategy"" to become more exclusive."
Hermès and LVMH 'handbag war' escalates - The Guardian,"Fri, 31 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTMvbWF5LzMxL2hlcm1lcy1sdm1oLWhhbmRiYWctd2FyLWVzY2FsYXRlc9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTMvbWF5LzMxL2hlcm1lcy1sdm1oLWhhbmRiYWctd2FyLWVzY2FsYXRlcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury French fashion label Hermès prides itself on assisting wealthy people who have run out of gift ideas: Nicolas Sarkozy once gave Barack Obama a €6,000 (£5000) black Hermès golfing bag, the Duke of Windsor ordered a custom-made patent leather wheelbarrow for Wallis Simpson and the Queen was once known to be very fond of the label's gloves. But when it comes to offering itself on a plate to eager tycoons building fashion empires, Hermès is rather more circumspect.

The family firm, which began as a harness-maker in the 19th century and is the last major independent luxury fashion house to resist the onslaught of multinationals and conglomerates, has escalated a dispute known as the ""handbag wars"" that has shaken the Paris luxury goods world.

The standoff between Hermès and its rival LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Dior, was played out at a hearing before France's stock market regulator on Friday amid allegations of secret takeover plots and sneaky bids for world domination.

The dispute began in 2010 when it emerged that LVMH, owned by Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, had secretly acquired a 17% stake in Hermès that has now risen to 22%. Hermès, run by the sixth generation of its founding family, is fiercely protective of keeping family control. It said it was stupefied to discover Arnault had built up the stake using a system that masked his true identity. It feared it was under attack by a businessman who had secretly spent 10 years trying to take it over. The company said there was ""an intruder in the garden but we don't want him in the house"".

The stock market watchdog can impose sanctions on Arnault if it finds his stake-building did not comply with market rules. Hermès also filed a legal complaint against LVMH for alleged insider trading and manipulation of share price. LVMH swiftly filed a counter complaint for slander, blackmail and unfair competition. The French media has likened the case to a thriller against a back-drop of a luxury goods market where a crocodile purse can cost more than a car.

LVMH's lawyers told the hearing the case was ""dysfunctional"", ""unfair"" and should be thrown out, saying it had done nothing wrong, and complaining of a ""smear campaign and slander"".

Hermès has defied the financial crisis with growing sales and continues to defend its painstakingly slow, handmade fashion. Its artisans train for three years before stitching their first clutch and its bags have waiting lists rumoured to be years long, including the Kelly, named after Grace Kelly who once famously shielded herself from paparazzi with a Hermès handbag, and the Birkin, created after the British actor Jane Birkin bumped into a Hermès executive on a plane and complained the Kelly wasn't big enough for everyday use. Recently a vintage crocodile Birkin fetched a record €63,800 at auction in Paris.

Arnault has rarely been out of the headlines in France. His recent application for Belgian citizenship caused outrage and political debate over tax and inheritance issues in France, before he told Le Monde he was staying put and had never intended to stop paying tax in France. A close friend of Sarkozy, he built his empire by spotting family tensions, and buying companies such as Louis Vuitton and Moët & Chandon from their founding families. This is not his first ""handbag war"" – he also had a failed standoff over Gucci with rival French businessman François Pinault.

If the stock market watchdog rules against him, in a decision expected later this summer, he could be fined millions of euros, a drop in the ocean of LVMH's net 2012 profit of €3.42bn. But LVMH is determined to keep its stake in Hermès.

Last week the Colbert committee of 75 French luxury houses, including Hermès and Dior, complained that the image of insecurity on Parisian streets, including wealthy Chinese tourists being attacked by pickpockets and thieves, was threatening the luxury fashion industry.

It remains to be seen whether the Hermès-LVMH dispute, now likely to continue for years, will also affect the luxury brands' image."

Graydon Carter on John Galliano's Fall and How Ingrid Sischy Reported His Story - Vanity Fair,"Wed, 01 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAxMy8wNy9ncmF5ZG9uLWNhcnRlci1qb2huLWdhbGxpYW5vLXN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s not every day that a vocal dispute in a bar in the Marais district of Paris makes headlines around the world. But when one of the combatants is John Galliano, head designer for Dior, and when the insults he leveled at a man and

woman on a chilly February evening two and a half years ago are as vile as they were, you’ve got the ingredients for a combustible international scandal. “Dirty Jewish face, you should be dead!” Galliano hissed at the woman during the confrontation. “Fucking Asian bastard, I’ll kill you!” he shouted at the man. The woman claimed that Galliano also dismissed her hair, her eyebrows, and, the final insult, her “cheap thigh boots.” The police were called. Four days later, a cell-phone video of another such incident was released. This one was even worse. It showed Galliano braying “I love Hitler” to a woman. “People like you would be dead today. Your mothers, your forefathers, would be fucking gassed, and fucking dead.”

And so, in the ensuing days, the legendary career of John Galliano, one of the most celebrated designers of the last half-century, all but evaporated. Natalie Portman, the “face” of Miss Dior Chérie perfume, who won the best-actress Oscar for Black Swan two days after news of the first confrontation broke, refused to wear the label at the Academy Awards. Dior, owned by the luxury giant LVMH, did what it had to do: it cashiered Galliano not only from his job atop the fashion house but also from the smaller, LVMH-owned firm that bears his name. As contributing editor Ingrid Si­schy notes in “Galliano in the Wilderness,” beginning on page 72, it was one of the swiftest, most stunning falls in fashion history—and doubly shocking to the fashion flock inasmuch as Galliano is not only among the most talented designers of his generation but also a man with a reputation for tolerance and inclusion, even by the generally tolerant and inclusive standards of the runway world.

Galliano went first into hiding and then into rehab for a variety of addictions. He issued a written apology, apologized again in court (he was convicted of making ethnic insults, a crime in France), and has since then remained silent. But he knew that at some point he would have to explain himself publicly, and in the end he decided to tell it here, to Ingrid, who has been following his career since the early 1990s, when she was the editor of Interview. This spring the two met over several days at his Paris apartment, just down the block from the café where he had upended his life and career. Galliano was brutally frank, both about himself—especially his mounting drug and alcohol problems at the time of the incidents—and about the fashion-world “bubble” he was living in. At the beginning of their conversations, he told Ingrid that it was the first interview he’d ever done in which he wasn’t drunk. As the designer himself said of his pre-scandal lifestyle, “I was going to end up either in a mental asylum or six feet under.”

This is a rare fashion story in that it involves so many orbiting perspectives outside the actual design world. To get to the root of Galliano’s myriad problems, Ingrid talked to Galliano’s close family of collaborators, people in the retail industry, Anti-Defamation League head Abe Foxman, the British rabbi Galliano has been tutored by, addiction experts, people inside LVMH, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who has long championed the designer. Through it all, Sischy explores the events in Galliano’s personal and work lives leading up to the incidents in order to find some explanation as to where that dark cauldron of bile and anti-Semitic harassment came from.

In today’s Blagojevichian, Sanfordized, and Weiner-ridden political litter box, it’s rare that you come across a public official who is so head and shoulders above the rest—as California attorney general Kamala Harris surely is. In this month’s Portrait (page 86), director J. J. Abrams pays homage to Harris, who, following her election in 2010, became the state’s first female, first African-American, and first Asian-American attorney general. Abrams describes her as an underdog up against epic threats on all sides, willing to give it everything she’s got for what is right. Among many such campaigns, Harris made headlines last year when she won a tough battle against five large financial institutions that yielded billions of dollars in settlement money to California homeowners affected by subprime-­mortgage shenanigans. The agreement came after she rejected the initial offer by the banks, a stance that resulted in withering attacks from both Wall Street and the White House. Harris made more unusual headlines earlier this year when President Obama let slip his personal opinion that she was “the best-looking attorney general” in the country. It should be noted that this was a statement the president was criticized for, but not challenged on."
Berluti Opens Its First Maison In China - Jing Daily,"Thu, 16 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9iZXJsdXRpLW9wZW5zLWl0cy1maXJzdC1tYWlzb24taW4tY2hpbmHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The interior of Berluti's new Shanghai location. (Berluti)

Berluti opened its first store in China carrying its entire product offering at the Shanghai IFC mall last week. The 3,700-square-foot boutique features leather bags, small leather goods, shoes, and ready-to-wear. A private lounge is dedicated to fittings, available by appointment.

The store is Berluti's second in Shanghai and part of a twenty-store global expansion for 2013. The aggressive expansion dovetails with a menswear year for the China market.

Berluti currently boasts a retail presence in first- and second-tier cities across China including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chengdu, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenyang, and Ningbo, compared to just four cities throughout Europe.

Long a luxury men's shoe brand with limited production and a cult following to match, Berluti was founded in Paris in 1895 by an Italian bootmaker and purchased by LVMH in 1993. In recent years, LVMH has positioned Berluti to compete with luxury menswear brands such as PPR-owned Brioni and Ermenegildo Zegna by hiring former Z Zegna creative director Alessandro Sartori as the the artistic director and acquiring French made-to-measure menswear brand Arnys.

With Antoine Arnault, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's son, heading the brand since 2012, it's safe to say that Berluti is poised to become a global presence.

The brand, owned by LVMH Group, will expand its retail network from the current 10 to 30, says CEO Sebastian Suhl.

Suhl said that he is aware that China’s gifting crackdown will affect the luxury sector, however, he is optimistic of the potential of the brand as middle class rises and the economy grows.

“Concern about the crackdown on the luxury goods market on the mainland is likely to be temporary because China needs to promote domestic consumption by boosting the consumer discretionary sector, such as services and non-essential goods,” Suhl said.

Meanwhile, Italian brand Gucci says it will not open additional China stores this year after slowdown dragged down its profits."
