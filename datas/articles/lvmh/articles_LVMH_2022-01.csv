LVMH Brands Double Down on JD.com Partnerships - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hL2x2bWgtYnJhbmRzLWRvdWJsZS1kb3duLW9uLWpkY29tLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Givenchy’s JD.com mini programme officially launched Tuesday, making the French label the latest in a raft of brands from luxury conglomerate LVMH to join forces with the Chinese e-commerce platform.

Even brands notoriously averse to partnering with third-party e-commerce platforms, such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Bulgari have signed on to JD.com’s mini programmes over the past 12 months in order to better reach China’s young, digitally-native luxury consumer base.

“What we are offering LVMH, which has a big group and within the group many different brands ... [is] the most tailored and customised business models, based on the brands’ needs,” Kevin Jiang, president of international business, JD Fashion and Lifestyle, told BoF, with brands able to choose from a wholesale model, a marketplace flagship model (similar to that offered by rival Tmall Luxury Pavilion) and the newer mini programme option.

“The brands can completely control the customer experience, the user journey, the layout,” Jiang said of the mini programmes, which can be virtually identical to the brand’s own WeChat mini programmes and were developed by JD.com in conjunction with “some of the top-tier brands” as a creative way to bridge the interests of brands with those of the e-commerce retailer, he added.

Though some LVMH Group brands began collaborating with JD.com prior to 2021, last year the floodgates really opened, with Louis Vuitton signing on in April, Berluti in June, Givenchy Beauty and Benefit Cosmetics in July, Bulgari and Guerlain in August and Dior and Loewe in November — all in time for the Singles’ Day promotional period. The latest addition, Givenchy, is offering its Chinese New Year collection exclusively for sale on on JD.com, Jiang said.

“Moving forward there will be more,” he added. JD.com has seen enormous growth in its luxury division over the past three years, admittedly off a low base in 2018, when only 20 brands had signed onto the platform (that number reached 300 by the end of 2021, according to JD.com figures).

Jiang says luxury sales on the platform have seen annual growth of over 200 percent year-on-year since 2019 and he expects a similar result in the year ahead.

“Luxury is going to continue to be one of the fastest-growing categories within fashion on JD,” he said.

Overall, China’s luxury online penetration increased from about 13 percent in 2019 to 23 percent in 2020, according to Bain, and as e-commerce luxury sales grow in China, so to does the competition between tech giants Alibaba-owned Tmall, JD.com, Douyin and WeChat.

“I wanted to redefine some watches and some movements, but you can’t make it like this,” he said, snapping his fingers during a recent video interview. “To define a good watch, you’ve got to work on it for five years. A movement takes five to 10 years. You can’t make watches quickly. This is what I’ve learned.”

He also described watchmaking as a “small world” where “finding the right experts is not so easy because everybody wants the same people.”

And LVMH has wanted Mr. Bianchi. In October, as part of a restructuring, he became president of the LVMH Watches and Jewelry Division, promoted by the LVMH Group’s chairman, Bernard Arnault, for the second time in two years."

Following its success since its founding in 2014, LVMH Luxury Ventures has taken a minority stake in the brand, which will continue to operate as normal out of its New York City offices, but with support from the conglomerate.

During the past few years, ALD has gained a cult following and has become a household name amongst fashion enthusiasts and streetwear fans, with collaborations ranging from Clarks and Woolrich to New Balance. The label's founder Teddy Santis was also appointed creative director of New Balance's ""Made in USA"" line last year, working with the label on plenty of footwear silhouettes and potential collaborations.

In addition to Aimé Leon Dore, LVMH also invested in Gabriela Hearst's eponymous label, as well as mystery-box shopping platform Heat. Based on previous investment history, LVMH has a pretty impressive track record when it comes to choosing brands.

As it stands, the investment won't impact the brand's aesthetic – we'll still see all the preppy design cues mixed with streetwear heritage we know and love."
Mystery box Heat raises $5 million from Antler and LVMH Luxury Ventures - Vogue Business,"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9teXN0ZXJ5LWJveC1oZWF0LXJhaXNlcy1kb2xsYXI1bWlsbGlvbi1mcm9tLWFudGxlci1sdm1oLWx1eHVyeS12ZW50dXJlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Luxury mystery box platform Heat has secured $5 million in seed funding led by industry heavyweights including venture capitalist firm Antler and LVMH Luxury Ventures.



Other strategic angel investors include Stefano Rosso, board member at OTB; the Hermès family; Michael Mitterlehner from L Catterton; Oliver Merkel from (Flink); and Spotify’s Sven Ahrens.

Launched in 2019 by Gen Z founders Joe Wilkinson and Mario Maher, both in their mid-20s, Heat allows luxury brands to monetise unsold inventory via desirable and buzzy drops of surprise merchandise. The platform purchases unsold inventory from over 60 luxury brand partners including Off-White, Casablanca and Palm Angels to curate its mystery boxes of clothing and accessories, sold in hyped drops on Instagram and YouTube to thousands of Gen Z fashion fans. With the new funding, Heat is hoping to build out its brand roster and become a Gen Z e-commerce leader across mystery boxes and retail, using gamification and AI to personalise the retail experience and box curation. LVMH’s brands are also expected to come on board, Wilkinson says.

Priced at $400 for two to three products worth $675, or $675 for two to four products worth $1200, Heat mystery boxes spread discounts unevenly across the items to mystify discounting and maintain brand integrity. The company has sold 20,000 boxes in the last two years, equivalent to over 100,000 products."

And while Erwan Rambourg, author of Future Luxe: What’s Ahead for the Business of Luxury, points out that that characterization isn’t exactly true to begin with, the pandemic may put the idea to rest for good.

Anish Melwani, Chairman & CEO of LVMH Inc., the U.S.-based subsidiary of global luxury giant LVMH, spoke at the French Institute Allliance Francaise of New York in November 2021.

Following a sharp contraction in 2020, the global luxury market surpassed pre-pandemic sales levels in 2021 — a resurgence powered by the U.S. and China, according to Bain & Company. Bain reports that the Americas are now the largest region in the world for luxury sales, representing $101.9 billion (31%) of the total global market.

To understand this momentous structural shift and its implications for the future of luxury, Rambourg sat down with Anish Melwani, Chairman & CEO of LVMH Inc., the U.S.-based subsidiary of global luxury giant LVMH, at an event hosted by the French Institute Alliance Française (FIAF) of New York in November 2021. The two discussed American consumers’ shifting attitudes toward luxury and how the pandemic has reshaped the luxury market in the U.S., including:

The pandemic made it clear that luxury ecommerce is not an oxymoron , with shoppers becoming increasingly channel-agnostic even for high-end purchases;

, with shoppers becoming increasingly channel-agnostic even for high-end purchases; Homebound U.S. consumers found refuge in “the dream” of luxury during the pandemic, leading to surges in both brand engagement and spending ; and

; and With tourism and business travel down, secondary markets like Atlanta and Houston rose in prominence, and this type of geographic reshuffling will continue.

Pandemic Propels New Growth in U.S. Luxury

LVMH holds a dominant position in the world of luxury, with some of the biggest names in fashion, spirits, cosmetics and jewelry. But even for these brands, the U.S. has been a tough nut to crack. The problem is less about the undeniable power of names like Louis Vuitton and Hennessy and more about the nature of the American market.

“Sidney Toledano, who was our chief executive at Dior for many years and now runs our fashion division, always said that the U.S. is a value market,” explained Melwani at the FIAF event. “This is the market of TJ Maxx, of off-price retailers, of outlet centers. Fundamentally the understanding of luxury has not penetrated American culture to nearly the extent of European culture, especially Western European culture. That’s the promise of this market — if it could reach even 50% of the level of penetration culturally that exists in Europe, then the demand potential is extraordinary.”

Turns out the global pandemic has given the U.S. a huge push toward realizing that potential. “The post-COVID principle is a bit awkward, especially if you’re based in Asia today, but the rest of the world has reopened somewhat and we’ve seen quite a bit of activity [in the luxury sector] in Europe and even more so here [in the U.S.],” said Rambourg. “When I published my book a year ago a lot of people said, ‘You’re so naïve, you’re too optimistic.’ The reality in hindsight is I was probably not bullish enough. Asia recouped pretty quickly, we’ve seen good potential with local European consumers, but the bulk of the positive surprise came from luxury demand in the U.S.”

Melwani believes LVMH has made 10 years of progress in the last two years in terms of U.S. market penetration. “People had disposable income but nothing to spend it on,” he noted, not to mention that with so much scary stuff happening in the world consumers were looking for ways to feel good. This spending effect has been reflected across a number of categories over the past two years, but the luxury sector in particular was aided by the fact that despite a general economic downturn, the equity and property markets remained strong.

“We just did some consumer research and the preliminary results are showing that two-thirds of the customers that we saw during this pandemic report being more engaged in luxury than ever before,” said Melwani. “They weren’t necessarily new to luxury; in fact, 98% of them had bought some luxury [items] in the past, but they became more engaged — they were visiting our websites more often, they were making appointments to come in, they were standing on lines.

“People were seeking out things to inspire them and make them feel good,” he added. “Luxury is very much about the dream. Now [that consumers] have taken the time to really engage with the luxury maisons and the luxury storytelling, I think this gives the industry an opportunity to further the penetration of luxury into American culture.”

Responding to the Rise of Secondary Markets and Channel-Agnostic Consumers

Beyond expanding the reach of luxury among U.S. consumers, the pandemic also is transforming the shape of luxury in America, both in terms of store footprints and digital engagement.

Melwani said that LVMH is seeing its brick-and-mortar presence spread out from the big cities. At the same time that traffic is down in locations like Manhattan, visits are up at what were previously considered secondary markets — cities like Atlanta, Houston, Troy, Mich. and Phoenix. “This is evidence of the deepening of penetration across the U.S.,” said Melwani. “Now people see luxury as something that they can buy close to home, not only as an indulgence when they go on a business trip to New York or vacation in Las Vegas or California.”

This trend is driving LVMH to reconsider its store allocation across the U.S.. While most LVMH maisons already have a presence in these secondary markets, in many of them brands are transitioning out of a wholesale mindset and even consider freestanding stores: “It’s an enhancement of the network in these areas that historically wouldn’t have justified that level of investment in staffing,” he said.

At the same time, the pandemic has forced all luxury brands to reconsider their position on ecommerce and abandon old stereotypes about what people will and won’t buy digitally. “I have colleagues in Europe who say, ‘But who would want to buy a $25,000 watch online?’ They say this as they are looking at the sales of $25,000 watches online. [Whether online is compatible with luxury] is really a rhetorical question at this point,” said Melwani.

Indeed, Melwani and his executives have come to the same realization as their counterparts across the retail industry — consumers, even luxury consumers, are becoming increasingly channel-agnostic. In fact, Melwani said that at one of its maisons the company found that 10% of its online business was coming from their top 2% of brick-and-mortar customers.

“The customer doesn’t see themselves as an online shopper or a brick-and-mortar shopper,” Melwani said. “The customer shops in stores when they can, when it’s convenient and when it’s something they want to do. But sometimes it’s two o’clock in the morning and they’re awake and they want to shop. These aren’t separate customers.”

What Will Endure and What Will Fade

This is of course a very unique moment in time. As to the long-term impact of the pandemic, Melwani said he thinks some of the “euphoric spending” that helped propel luxury to new heights last year will fade as the pandemic drags on and inflation impacts equity markets.

“I have some concerns about 2022,” he said. “My observation has been that luxury is much more sensitive to the ‘wealth effect’ than the ‘income effect.’ You can raise taxes by a couple of percentage points and nobody changes their spending habits materially. On the other hand, when the market goes down by 15%, everybody feels poor all of a sudden. Even if the market had been up 30% before that, all of a sudden it causes a retrenchment of spending from an emotional perspective.”

But Melwani doesn’t think that a potential dip in 2022 will lead to a reversal of the growth the U.S. has seen in the last two years, even as spending on other discretionary categories like travel and experiences returns. “Once you discover luxury, once you discover what it means in terms of quality, in terms of heritage, and you decide to make those things part of your identity as an individual, it’s not so easy to reverse that,” he said. “If you’ve developed as part of your identity that you now wear Dior sneakers, for example, and you’ve been wearing those at home, are you not going to wear them when you go on your first vacation to a fancy hotel? Or are you going to want to actually continue to project that identity that you have been developing? My hypothesis is more of the latter than the former.”"

The French luxury conglomerate, which helms 75 top-tier brands including Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co., raked in a record €64.2 billion ($71.5 billion) in revenue in 2021, according to annual results shared late Thursday. That’s a 44 percent increase compared to 2020’s total revenue of $49.7 billion and a 20 percent jump from 2019’s $59.8 billion. The upswing confirms LVMH is indeed back on track after the severe disruption caused by the global pandemic.

“LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis,” Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

The significant growth points to the enduring appeal of LVMH’s rarified products, as well as the unwavering demand for them. Fashion and leather goods, in particular, performed exceptionally well last year. The division, which includes the likes of Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Loewe and Fendi, reached record highs, with organic revenue eclipsing 2019 levels by 42 percent to reach a total of $34.3 billion.

Bolstered by the $15.8 billion purchase of Tiffany, the watches and jewelry division hit record levels in 2021, as did the wine and spirits division, which is made up of heavy-hitters such as Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy. The only two divisions that did not surpass 2019 levels were perfumes and cosmetics and selective retail which includes Sephora.

Regarding specific markets, LVMH said the US and Asia experienced strong revenue growth over the course of the year, while Europe is experiencing a more gradual recovery.

Following the announcement, LVMH shares skyrocketed and were up 3.9 percent in early session trading on Friday. ​​This means the luxury titan’s market value is currently sitting at about $390 billion at the time of this writing.

As for the coming year, LVMH’s formidable leader is confident that the company will stay at the top of the luxury sector.

“Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence and are convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to further strengthen its lead in the global luxury market,” Arnault added."

Building on that collaboration, Santis was named Creative Director of New Balance’s Made in USA line last year.

Under the terms of the deal, Aimé Leon Dore will continue to be based at its New York head offices, while LVMH will also offer support and guidance to the brand. Sources also told WWD that the brand plans to add to its current New York flagship with a London store early this year.

In a statement announcing the investment, Teddy Santis said:

As the luxury industry takes center stage in the growth hopes of the metaverse — with a virtual Gucci bag selling for $4,500 on Roblox — brands like Nike , Balenciaga and Burberry are making plans to turn their real-world status into digital profits. Nike recently acquired digital-sneaker brand RTFKT, which sold 600 pairs of virtual shoes for $3.1 million, while Burberry collaborated with Mythical Games to launch nonfungible tokens.

For now, LVMH is focused on the real rather than the virtual, Arnault said, during the company's earnings call Thursday.

""At this stage, we are very much in the real world, selling real products,"" he said. ""We are not interested in selling virtual sneakers for 10 euros. We're not into that.""

Arnault also warned of potentially speculative bubbles that have little lasting commercial value similar to many of the companies and promises of the dot-com bubble."

Profits more than doubled from 2020.

Some units and regions that had bounced back more slowly, like Sephora and Europe, show signs of turning a corner.

Growth is still being driven mainly by the group’s biggest and most profitable fashion labels, Dior and Vuitton. Tiffany, too, posted record sales and profits.

In a year when global luxury sales grew fast, LVMH’s brands grew faster.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and many other labels reported 2021 revenues that rose 36 percent year-on-year to €64.2 billion ($71 billion), growing 14 percent over 2019′s pre-pandemic levels. Profits more than doubled year-on-year to €17.15 billion, the company said Thursday.

Growth at the French luxury conglomerate continues to be driven by its biggest and most recognisable brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior, which have been rapidly increasing their share of the fashion market since the pandemic. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division reported sales that grew 42 percent versus 2019, accelerating in the fourth quarter to grow by 51 percent by that measure.

Tiffany & Co., which LVMH acquired in January 2021, also posted a record year in terms of both sales and profits, LVMH said, despite the closure for renovation of its iconic New York flagship, which is set to reopen later this year.

LVMH grew more than three times faster in 2021 than the personal luxury goods market overall, which is expected to have risen by four percent over 2019 levels (adjusting for currency swings), according to estimates from consultancy Bain. In his annual speech to analysts and investors, chairman Bernard Arnault said the strong revenue growth was continuing so far this year.

“January’s sales reconfirm growth at the same rhythm as at the end of last year,” he said.

In addition to the record-breaking numbers at LVMH’s strongest units, Arnault had more to say than usual about some the group’s businesses that have faced a rockier road since the pandemic.

Celine, which had seen historic clients exit following an abrupt repositioning by Hedi Slimane in 2018 and 2019, may finally be taking off. LVMH had previously flagged that the brand returned to growth in the first half of 2021. Now Arnault says “it’s one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in the world.”

Whether those results are meetings targets, considering the intense level of investment LVMH has put in the brand since Slimane’s arrival, is less clear. In any case, Arnault’s bullish tone for the unit could suggest LVMH would favour leaning into the current inflection at the unit rather than pulling back. He said Slimane was “stuffed with talent.”

Beauty retailing giant Sephora’s sales are back above 2019 levels, LVMH said, thanks mainly to strength in its e-commerce operations. That unit, too, had faced an uphill climb since the pandemic, as it relies on retail foot-traffic in districts that have been calmed by telework and the lack of tourism. (Sales tactics that involve sharing testers with other clients and being touched by sales associates weren’t Covid-friendly either.)

LVMH’s retail unit owning Sephora, DFS, and Paris’ Le Bon Marché and Samaritaine department stores was nonetheless the group’s worst-performing, with sales still down 18 percent versus 2019.

Perfume and beauty sales were still down slightly, which LVMH attributed (as in recent quarters) to its choice not to redirect inventory to the grey market to make up for a drop in wholesale orders.

LVMH's Arnault is wary of the metaverse “bubble”. Should luxury be? - Vogue Business,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1ocy1hcm5hdWx0LWlzLXdhcnktb2YtdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1idWJibGUtc2hvdWxkLWx1eHVyeS1iZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault is cautious of the metaverse “bubble”, the digital world that has infatuated fashion and luxury with its exclusivity, hype and Gen Z-leaning community.

“We have to see what will be the applications of the metaverse and NFTs,” Arnault said in response to a query on the metaverse during the company’s earnings call on 27 January. “It can undoubtedly have a positive impact —if it is well done — on the activity of the brands, but it is not our objective to sell virtual sneakers at €10. We are not interested in that.”

LVMH is carefully eyeing an opportunity that other companies such as Nike, Gucci, Adidas, Prada and Balmain have already embraced, particularly in the past year. Nike built a digital world on Roblox and acquired virtual goods marketplace Rtfkt, while Adidas and Prada partnered on an NFT launch last week. Kering-owned brands Gucci and Balenciaga have tested the waters: Gucci partnered with virtual platforms Zepeto and Roblox to create digital products, while Balenciaga launched on Fortnite. Balmain and Dolce & Gabbana have also sold NFTs. A November report from Morgan Stanley predicted that metaverse gaming and NFTs would account for 10 per cent of the addressable luxury goods market by 2030, and pointed to early adopters as most likely to benefit.

“We expect the whole sector to benefit from the advent of the metaverse, but see the soft luxury brands (ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, etc.) as particularly well positioned. We see Kering as best placed given the group's brand demographics and given head start in innovative digital collaborations,” Morgan Stanley analyst Edouard Aubin wrote in the report.

Read More LVMH annual fashion sales surge 47 per cent on US, China The luxury conglomerate’s fashion and leather goods division spiked last year despite ongoing pandemic disruptions. CEO Bernard Arnault discussed the metaverse opportunity, acquisitions and what’s next at Louis Vuitton.

LVMH is not ruling out the opportunity, said Arnault. To note, the company has already made some strategic moves that could be considered part of the metaverse or metaverse-adjacent: it partnered with other luxury companies in creating the Aura Blockchain Consortium, a luxury blockchain. And Louis Vuitton has partnered with gaming company League of Legends, experimented with Snapchat’s AR tool and also created NFTs within its own video game.

“It’s hard to segment what is and isn't ‘the metaverse’, because it’s a continuation and improvement of the technologies we are already using, from AR filters to high-def and hyper-real product portrayals.

LVMH Invests in Aimé Leon Dore | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWludmVzdHMtaW4tYWltZS1sZW9uLWRvcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Luxury Ventures, the French luxury conglomerate’s arm dedicated to investing in small creative brands, has taken a minority stake in the New York-based label Aimé Leon Dore for an undisclosed sum.

The streetwear brand was founded in Queens, New York by entrepreneur and creative director Teddy Santis in 2014. Since then, its preppy infused designs have gained traction, reflecting a wider rediscovery of a style that was once a driving force in urban fashion.

Sometimes referred to as “ALD” by its cult following, the brand offers streetwear staples like graphic tees and hoodies alongside more elevated items like rugby shirts, tailored pants and Wallabee lace-ups. The styles harkened back to the iconic fits of ‘90s hip-hop stars like Nas and the WuTang Clan, who employed preppy labels like Tommy Hilfiger in radically oversized silhouettes.

In recent years, Aimé Leon Dore’s unique brand of elevated urban Americana has attracted partnerships with the likes of Woolrich and Clarks — heritage brands seeking to reach a younger, trendier audience. Santis was named creative director of New Balance’s “Made in USA” line last year.

Recent collections have also seen the brand blend streetwear signatures with workwear references evoking Santis’ Greek heritage, like wooly fishing caps and waterproof wader pants.

Aimé Leon Dore will continue to operate independently out of its NYC offices while receiving support and guidance from LVMH, the company said.

LVMH Luxury Venture’s other investments include luxury label Gabriela Hearst and mystery-box start-up Heat. Previous minority stakes by taken by the unit include Stadium Goods, which sold to Farfetch for $250 million in 2019 and Officine Universelle Buly, a relaunch Napoleon-era maker of skincare and perfumes, which ended up being fully acquired by LVMH in October.

"LVMH annual fashion sales surge 47 per cent on US, China - Vogue Business","Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWFubnVhbC1mYXNoaW9uLXNhbGVzLXN1cmdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US and Asia were the key growth drivers, up 30 per cent and up 40 per cent in the fourth quarter 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2019 respectively. LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony noted the “steady improvement” in Europe, where sales rose 1 per cent in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2019.

LVMH is leading luxury’s pandemic bounce back. Its 2021 performance underscores an ongoing pattern over the past two years in luxury fashion: the biggest players have fared best thanks to house cachet and marketing budgets. Sales at Richemont’s jewellery maisons, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, rose 57 per cent in its third fiscal quarter from October to December, versus the same period in 2019.

“The earnings season has so far demonstrated that category leaders are smashing it: Richemont in jewellery and LVMH in leather goods,” wrote Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst Antoine Belge. Consensus expectations for Kering in the fourth quarter of 2021 are an 11 per cent increase in constant currency relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 with Gucci at a 4.2 per cent increase, per Visible Alpha.

Speaking to the fashion unit’s performance, Arnault said that “the credit is first and foremost to Louis Vuitton, which is far more than just a fashion company. In fact, it’s not a fashion company. It’s a culturally creative company,” he said. The dynamic teams and designers have “taken this brand from success to success whilst attracting the youngest as well as the most mature of our customer segments in the world.”

On the drivers of the performance in Western countries and China, Arnault reiterated that, “Louis Vuitton sells culture to Americans and Europeans,” and noted that the Morozov exhibition currently on view at Fondation Louis Vuitton has attracted 800,000 visitors so far. “The reasons why our products, our brands are extremely appealing: we sell a lot more than just fashion. I think that’s the most important thing.” He added: “Indeed, I keep saying this, Louis Vuitton is not a fashion company. And all this is very attractive to our Chinese customers.”

Asked how far along the house is in the process of replacing Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton who died in November, Arnault said: “Virgil was an extraordinary creator, more than a fashion designer. He was a man of culture. His last show that he had actually designed prior to his death was a cultural event. It was not just a fashion show. We are still mourning him. Once that [mourning period] is behind us, we will consider the next move.”"

Its relaunch of designs by Jean Schlumberger also did well.During a results presentation Thursday, CEO Bernard Arnault, who called Tiffany’s integration “the event of the year,” noted the brand performed exceedingly well even though its flagship New York store, a strong revenue driver, was still closed for renovations. The store is expected to reopen at the end of 2022.

Bulgari put on a “good” performance, said LVMH, particularly in its own stores.“Bulgari seeks to concentrate now, as Tiffany is doing, on its jewelry sales in its own stores,” said Arnault.Its Bzero1, Serpenti, and Diva lines did well, as did its high jewelry line, Magnifica. Its Octo Finissimo watch won the coveted Aiguille d’Or grand prize.Chaumet, meanwhile, performed especially well in Japan, said Arnault.The brand has had a busy year, launching a new diamond cut called the Taille Impératrice, celebrating its long-standing history through a “Joséphine and Napoléon” exhibition at its Place Vendôme store in Paris, and introducing “Torsade,” its new high jewelry collection.TAG Heuer also had a good year, signing Ryan Gosling as an ambassador and teaming up with Porsche on a collection.Arnault wore a TAG Heuer Porsche Carerra on his wrist during the presentation, adding the watch is “so successful that it’s difficult to find.”The brand also launched a limited-edition Super Mario version of its smartwatch to appeal to gamers.Hublot collaborated with famed Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on a collection. The brand performed especially well in the U.S. and China, said LVMH.It signed tennis star Novak Djokvoic , who made headlines for attempting to attend the Australian Open while unvaccinated against COVID-19, as its ambassador earlier this year.Speaking about Fred, the jewelry brand “is rebounding with a great team,” said Arnault. The brand has continued its growth, finding success with its Pretty Woman collection.Zenith’s new products also have performed well, he said. Its new Zenith Chronomaster Sport won the 2021 “Best Chronograph” award at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève.Arnault also addressed the metaverse, an area in which Kering-owned Gucci and Balenciaga have joined other luxury brands, but he noted NFTs were not LVMH’s focus at the moment.He suggested others take a cautious approach to the prospect, drawing a connection to the dot-com bubble.“At this stage, we are very much in the real world selling real products,” he said. “We are not interested in selling virtual sneakers for €10. We’re not into that.”LVMH did not provide fiscal guidance for 2022 but said it remains confident that its current growth will continue."

Angel investors this round include OTB Group’s Stefano Rosso, the Hermès family, L Catterton partner Michael Mitterlehner, German grocery start-up Flink founder Oliver Merkel and Spotify’s director of global growth Sven Ahrens.

More from WWD

The fresh capital injection will be used to create more innovative and immersive e-commerce experiences — which include implementing gamification, AI-driven personalization and interactive drops — while continuing to drive sustainability.

Joe Wilkinson, chief executive officer of Heat, added the funding will enable the company to further create “a shopping platform for a digital generation and [we] are positioned to continue to innovate and make an impact in this space.”

Martell Hardenberg, partner at Antler, said, “We are sitting on one of the greatest opportunities in luxury retail with consumer behavior changing dramatically over the coming years. Heat has created a unique platform for consumers and brands alike to create a new shopping and selling experience while protecting brand integrity.”

Cofounded by Wilkinson and Mario Maher in 2019, the London-based company has sold more than 20,000 mystery boxes to its 600,000-plus Gen Z-led online community.

A normal box, which claims to guarantee to have 500 pounds-plus worth of items, is priced at 299 pounds, while the premium version, which comes with items worth more than 850 pounds, costs 500 pounds.

Heat operates distribution hubs in Sheffield, England, and in Milan and has plans to further expand the network in Europe and the U.S.

Wilkinson describes the company as a disruptor of traditional luxury fashion retail, and said Heat is standing “at the forefront of next-generation routes to market for a Gen Z audience.”

From the brands’ perspective, Heat was an appealing outlet for surplus stock. By partnering with Heat on the boxes, brands don’t have to discount the inventory or find other ways to shift it.

“A lot of brands don’t want to put their excess stock on sale or dispose of it in landfill. They need a new way of getting rid of the stock that protects the brand values,” Wilkinson told WWD in an earlier interview.

He said the company began by sourcing products directly from department stores, but soon brands with similar surplus stock issues came calling.

Now Heat is working with more than 60 brands directly, including Off-White, Palm Angels, Amiri, Billionaire Boys Club and Casablanca, and has expanded its scope beyond the streetwear niche to men’s and women’s contemporary and luxury fashion, offering items from brands like Balenciaga, Loewe, Jacquemus and JW Anderson.

The company has also evolved from its initial focus of sourcing previous seasons’ stock to working with brands to launch products via its mystery boxes, namely with Haider Ackermann and British men’s label Represent.

“It’s really turned into a customer acquisition and marketing tool for brands. They now come to us and say that they want to get new season products into the boxes. Because so many influencers are opening the boxes on their Instagram Stories, people are seeing the products and want to go out and buy them at full retail price,” Wilkinson said.

This way of working with new and old season products allows Heat to offer added value to its customers and keeps them coming back for more, while brands get to experiment with a different way of selling and talking to the sought-after Gen Z and Millennial consumer.

“Brands have been coming to us through referrals, say, from their wholesale directors, so we’ve seen organic growth. We are aware we are a new chapter for these brands,” Maher said.

Wilkinson, at the time, touted that the next stage for the company is to launch a kids’ wear mystery box and to have more collaborations with brands on exclusive products that will only be available in the boxes.

"LVMH Net Profit Jumps 156% in 2021, Boosted by Strong Q4 - WWD","Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLWZvdXJ0aC1xdWFydGVyLWZhc2hpb24tbGVhdGhlci1nb29kcy1zYWxlcy1qdW1wLTEyMzUwNTU2OTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said net profit soared 156 percent year-over-year in 2021, as a better-than-expected fourth quarter confirmed strong demand for its luxury products, fueled by the key fashion and leather goods division.

The luxury conglomerate, which owns 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora, said net profit totaled 12 billion euros last year, up 68 percent compared to 2019, beating a FactSet consensus estimate of 10.9 billion euros.

Profit from recurring operations stood at 17.1 billion euros, up 49 percent versus 2019, which is considered a more reliable benchmark due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

Fashion and leather goods posted organic growth of 51 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2019, marking a sharp acceleration versus previous quarters and reflecting the strength of marquee brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as a record year for Celine and Fendi. The division generated profit from recurring operations of 12.8 billion euros, up 75 percent compared with 2019.

In the watches and jewelry division, LVMH flagged a “record” performance by Tiffany, after completing its $15.8 billion purchase of the U.S. jeweler a year ago.

“The performance for the year confirms a return to strong growth momentum following the severe disruption to the first half of 2020 resulting from the global pandemic,” the company said in a statement. “Within the context of a gradual recovery from the health crisis, LVMH is confident in its ability to maintain its current growth momentum.”

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, paid tribute to Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of men’s collections at Vuitton, who died in November at the age of 41 from a rare form of cancer.

“His immense visionary talent and his great wisdom will forever be embedded within the history of our group,” Arnault said in a statement. Abloh’s last collection for Vuitton was unveiled in Paris last week at two shows attended by members of the Arnault family and Abloh’s wife Shannon, alongside celebrities including J Balvin, Victor Cruz, Naomi Campbell, Venus Williams and Tyler the Creator.

Vuitton chairman and CEO Michael Burke told WWD the brand was in no rush to name Abloh’s successor. “It needs to be given the right amount of time. It cannot be done under pressure,” he said.

LVMH’s fourth-quarter revenues totaled 20 billion euros, up 22 percent in organic terms versus 2019, topping analysts’ expectations. The strong results come after Compagnie Financière Richemont reported that revenues in the three months to Dec. 31 jumped 38 percent at constant currency rates versus the same period two years earlier. Kering is due to publish annual results on Feb. 17.

LVMH Luxury Ventures Invests in Aimé Leon Dore - WWD,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtYWltZS1sZW9uLWRvcmUtaW52ZXN0LTEyMzUwMzMwNzQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Underscoring how it has its pulse on what’s cool and emerging in New York City, LVMH Luxury Ventures has taken a minority stake in Aimé Leon Dore, a streetwear brand with a cult following — and a tinge of preppy polish.

Established in Queens in 2014, Aimé Leon Dore is perhaps best known for its sneaker collaborations with New Balance and clothes and accessories inspired by New York City itself, particularly its 1990s hip-hop scene and pick-up basketball culture.

The investment sets the stage for the brand to expand internationally, and likely grow its retail footprint, given the French group’s real-estate clout and relations with developers.

According to sources, the brand plans to open a boutique in London as early as March.

“LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth for Aimé Leon Dore,” founder Teddy Santis said in a statement.

Financial terms were not disclosed.

LVMH Luxury Ventures said Aimé Leon Dore would continue to operate independently out of its New York offices, with the fund’s support and guidance.

Santis launched into fashion with a made-up brand name, slim sweatpants and down vests that he paired with Air Jordan 1 sneakers. Today Aimé Leon Dore creates seasonal ready-to-wear, footwear and accessories collections. It has also done collaborations with Woolrich, Suicoke, Timberland, New Era, Paraboot, Drake’s and Porsche.

The brand’s flagship in NoLIta currently its only location in the world, is also home to Café Leon Dore, which serves coffee and pastries from Greece — a nod to the homeland of Santis’ parents.

It is understood the brand has been charting rapid growth in recent years, primarily via its online store, which ships worldwide, and despite having trimmed all wholesale accounts to become a purely direct-to-consumer brand.

Aimé Leon Dore is analogous in some ways to Supreme — at least in its sparse interactions with the press, commitment to organic growth, and tight control of its distribution and image.

It is understood LVMH was attracted to the company’s cultural relevance, community-building know-how, elevated and refined approach to products, and sophisticated campaigns around product drops, often involving artists and musicians.

The brand counts 726,000 followers on Instagram, an eclectic tumble of vintage photography, film stills, artworks and product shots, including a closeup of an embroidery reading: “A team from outta Queens with the American dream. A.L.D.N.Y.C.”

Santis has collaborated frequently with Boston-based New Balance, reimagining styles including the 550, the 1300, the 990, the 997 and the 827. Last April he took on the role of creative director of New Balance’s Made in USA label, the activewear brand’s designation for product that has a domestic value of 70 percent or more.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton established LVMH Luxury Ventures in 2017 with a mission to take minority stakes in early-stage luxury brands that have high growth potential and compelling business models.

Its first investments were French beauty brand Officine Universelle Buly 1803 and New York-based sneaker reseller Stadium Goods, both of which it has already exited.

In 2019, it took a minority stake in Gabriela Hearst, the luxury women’s wear label devoted to sustainability.

Its current portfolio also includes Los Angeles-based skin care brand Versed, California apparel brand Madhappy, New York-based watch platform Hodinkee, British mystery box start-up Heat, and social shopping specialist Replika Software, based in New York and Paris.

According to its website, LVMH Luxury Ventures targets companies with revenue between 3 million and 30 million euros, and makes equity investments ranging from 2 million to 15 million euros, yielding shareholdings of between 5 and 25 percent.

Nigo Just Might Be the Best Appointment LVMH Has Ever Made - Highsnobiety,"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9uaWdvLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s no longer news that men's fashion has undergone a seismic shift in which luxury, designer, and streetwear bleed into each other. The result is sometimes sublime, and sometimes an absurd amalgam that can be a bit hard to grasp.

Underneath the self-congratulating narrative of the streetwear camp lies something a bit more prosaic. What we are witnessing is a two-fold change: First, that today there are vastly more men who are interested in fashion than even a decade ago. Second, we are undergoing a generational shift, one where the Millennials and Gen-Z are quickly displacing Boomers and Gen-Xers as fashion’s core customer. By and large, what these young men seem to want is an elevated version of the familiar stuff they grew up with. Thus, streetwear and fashion meet.

Highsnobiety / Eva Al Desnudo

Few business people understood this shift better than Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, fashion’s biggest conglomerate. This may have something to do with the business training he received in the years he spent building a real estate fortune in the United States before moving into the luxury industry in Paris; though he may be all Parisian polish on the outside, his business instincts are American.

And unlike most Parisians, who keep holding onto a peculiarly anachronistic and out-of-touch Francocentric outlook on fashion, Arnault has never had qualms about tapping global talent - from Marc Jacobs and John Galliano to Carol Lim and Humberto Leon - for his luxury empire. Thus we saw Virgil Abloh installed at Louis Vuitton, then Matthew M. Williams at Givenchy, and now Nigo at Kenzo. And you see this playbook being emulated across the market with Rhude founder Rhuigi Villaseñor’s recent appointment at Bally. What fuccbois want, fuccbois shall have.

Highsnobiety / Eva Al Desnudo

But the marriage of streetwear and luxury has never been comfortable. The cultural aspect that is (or was) at the core of streetwear, with its grassroots underpinnings that often came from youth subcultures, is as foreign to Parisian ateliers as the latest Young Thug mixtape is to your grandmother. The Louis Vuitton / Supreme collaboration ushered in by Kim Jones - another hypebeast favorite - made many streetwear diehards cringe, but there was no stopping the gilded money printer. Jones made room for Abloh, whose bankable Off-White label, history-making sneaker sales with Nike, and his connection to Kanye West, the patron saint of streetwear, made him a prime candidate.

Abloh’s record at Louis Vuitton wasn’t as exciting as we treat it in retrospect. Notwithstanding his cultural relevance, his output for the brand was inconsistent. In his work I saw the natural uncertainty of someone who knew he was doing too many things at once. Though eager, Abloh never quite settled into the level of confidence that was required for such a daunting task. His shows could have used some editing down, a narrower focus that would have shown strength of conviction. Instead, his good ideas were often diminished by weaker ones, like in the show we just saw where strong tailoring was incoherently mixed with streetwear that was a jumble of logos. I can see a similar shakiness in Matthew M. Williams, who shines at Alyx, where he is comfortable in the product-driven environment he keenly understands, but is less certain at a couture house like Givenchy.

In a way then, Nigo’s task was simpler. Though in its original 1970s iteration under Kenzo Takada it was a luxury fashion house, thanks to a redesign by Opening Ceremony’s Lim and Leon it has become a youthful, quirky label that, like Acne Studios, sits somewhere between designer and contemporary. Hence, it would have been relatively easy for Nigo to make Kenzo into another streetwear-ified, logo-oriented, sneaker-hoodie-T-shirt line. (And by the way, no one knows how to do it better.)

Instead, he took the radical step of presenting a full-fledged fashion collection that looked fresh, energetic, and most importantly, unpretentious. The first look, a women's hooded tartan poncho over tartan pants, and – gasp, were those boots and not sneakers? - was a shot across the bow of preconceived notions and hardened expectations. And on it went, with all-over flower prints as well as Takada’s original drawings and experiments in denim. Logos were kept to a minimum and there was not a single collab in sight.

Highsnobiety / Eva Al Desnudo

“The goal for me at Kenzo — but I think in principle it should be the goal for everyone in fashion — is for the main collection that I’m putting most of my creative energy into to be the thing that is, even in commercial terms, the core driver of the business and the thing that people are most interested in,” Nigo told Vogue. “We are entering a period when the main collection is some kind of background,” he continued, “and it's only the collaborations that generate any interest or sell, which, to me, feels like very much the wrong approach.”

The importance of this statement from one of the forefathers of streetwear can hardly be underestimated. He is not the first to express the notion that streetwear has become too easy and too formulaic — slap two logos onto a hoodie, put it on the right talent, and watch the cash rake in. Undercover’s Jun Takahashi - with whom Nigo started when the pair opened their legendary NOWHERE store while attending the Bunka fashion college in Tokyo - said the same thing with his SS20 collection, which was all suiting and jacquard. Even Abloh expressed the same frustration by declaring that the streetwear is dead.

Certainly streetwear is alive and well and will not be dying any time soon. Its strength lies in its ease; its messaging is direct and its garments comfortable. It does not ask much of its audience. But Kenzo under Nigo already proves two things. First, that the fatigue with the luxury takeover of streetwear is palpable. And second, that there is a way out."
"Luxury Brands LVMH, Prada, Cartier Team Up - PYMNTS.com","Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMi9sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tcHJhZGEtY2FydGllci10ZWFtLXRyYWNrLXByb3ZlbmFuY2UtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’ve ever shopped in midtown Manhattan, you know that you can buy a Louis Vuitton bag for $2,000 in Neiman Marcus or $20 from the guy across the street with a blanket full of “Louis Vuitton” bags. And without a close inspection, they often look basically the same.

That’s why Louis Vuitton’s owner, the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods group is a founding member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium, a private, permissioned blockchain piggybacked on Ethereum that is designed to provide proof of provenance, allowing consumers to trace the history of their LV-logoed bag — or Hublot watch, Prada gown and Bulgari perfume — from the design studio to the French tannery producing the leather to the artisans who sew it together to the warehouses, shipping lines and distribution centers that deliver it to Neiman Marcus.

Announced in April, the blockchain went live Thursday (Jan. 13), with founding members LVMH, Prada Group, Cartier, part of Richemont, and OTB Group working together in a “private permission-based blockchain platform which offers both up-stream and down-stream traceability in the supply chain,” the consortium said. “Aura helps luxury brands to address the following topics: authenticity, ownership, warranty, transparency and traceability” as well as raw materials souring data.

Built on the public, open-source Ethereum blockchain but requiring permission to join, Aura is a “single solution to address the shared challenges of communicating authenticity, responsible sourcing and sustainability in a secure digital format,” the consortium said.

What’s unusual about Aura is that it is an industry consortium, with competitors LVMH, Prada Group, Cartier, part of Richemont, and OTB Group working together.

Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group’s head of Marketing and Corporate Social Responsibility made that point in April, when the Aura project was announced.

Aura is “an incredible journey together with our luxury partners and in a trustful collaboration never seen before in our sector,” Bertelli said at the time. “We have created an exceptional and innovative project aiming to put our customers at the very center creating major values to them through a sustainable authentication system which will unlock future possibilities.”

Why Blockchain?

Outside of cryptocurrency, banking and finance, the main use of blockchain technology is supply chain management. Provenance was one of the first commercial uses of this aspect of blockchain, with upscale French supermarket chain Carrefour using it to allow buyers to use a QR code to trace the particular organic chicken they picked up off the shelf all the way back to the particular farmer that raised it — providing proof of its organic credentials, a rich marketing channel for the product, and a greater sense of trust and loyalty to Carrefour.

But Ford, VW, Tesla and others have used it to show that their Congo-sourced cobalt is ethically mined, and DeBeers Group uses the Tracr blockchain as a way of removing — and publicly proving it had removed — blood diamonds from the supply chain, as well tracing the stone through cutting and polishing, to the jewelry manufacturer and retailer.

Safety is another big use. IBM Blockchain has built platforms to prove that Norwegian seafood was sustainably harvested — a use recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in a 2020 report titled “Blockchain Application in Seafood Value Chains” — and that Chinese pork was safely raised, butchered and transported after a string of safety incidents spooked consumers. Walmart is requiring that suppliers of leafy greens get on its blockchain platform after 2018’s string of romaine lettuce salmonella recalls, with other produce following suit.

But these private — or enterprise — blockchain platforms, which require permission to join, are not just used for food safety or handbag provenance. The Maersk-developed TradeLens blockchain platform is one of the most successful uses, with more than half of the world’s container shipping tracked on the blockchain platform, which includes the top competing shipping lines, port management forms and even customs agencies. In this case, the point is not showing end-buyers where goods came from but tracking them more effectively.

Easy to Use

This blockchain use case offers better logistical support, allows shippers to identify problems — and implement fixes — as soon as they happen. It also makes it far quicker to trace problems to their source. Those romaine lettuce outbreaks forced all of the produce in the country to be destroyed, left to rot for weeks as authorities traced the contagion back to a single region’s farms — searching every step of the distribution chain in sequence. On a blockchain platform, it would take seconds.

Aura is being sold as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) system hosted on Microsoft Azure, with the Aura Blockchain Consortium promising lower upfront costs, as well as low licensing and onboarding costs.

“Aura SaaS provides a game-changing toolbox for the luxury industry with an easy onboarding, minimum costs and without the need to manage any cloud infrastructure and deploying any instance, thus reducing the time-to-market,” said Daniela Ott, secretary general of Aura Blockchain Consortium. “It is a solution suitable for luxury brands of any size, for most product categories within the luxury sphere.”

The service will offer white-label interfaces that are customized to each brand’s front end and a simple-to-manage input system. This ranges from a smart contract generator to easy-to-write webpages and product history management. This will cover features, including authenticity, ownership, warranty, transparency and traceability targeting both upstream use cases (e.g. raw material sourcing) and downstream use cases (e.g. digital certificates of ownership and authenticity certified on the Aura Blockchain, eWarranty, transfer of ownership, etc.)

One of the biggest benefits of enterprise blockchain is that every supplier can add their information to a single system but ensure it is only readable to specific members — or even that specific parts are readable by specific members.

That’s why one of the earliest uses that enterprise blockchain providers pitched back in 2018 was to the health insurance industry. A single blockchain could hold members’ health records on an immutable (unchangeable) blockchain with other members like hospitals only able to see the parts of the records they need — for example, if someone has been vaccinated — when they need them. Equally, the technology could be used to allow an employer to see what percentage of their employees have been vaccinated without telling them who is and isn’t.

That failed to catch on, however, as the corporate executives were unwilling to work with competitors, even with non-private information like a single database of easily updatable healthcare providers’ addresses — something that can bring fines under the federal Affordable Care Act if not accurate. It is time-consuming work repeated by all insurance companies, yet they couldn’t work together on even that.

Then there’s the use of smart contracts. In the car insurance industry, a blockchain could automate payment of claims between industry partners. Once adjusters determine a crash was one person’s fault, the system could send payment to the other’s company to cover what it paid out."
"Louis Vuitton's owner, LVMH, acquires minority stake in Aimé Leon Dore - Inverse","Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL2FpbWUtbGVvbi1kb3JlLWx2bWgtbWlub3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW93bmVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aimé Leon Dore has become one of the hottest brands as it bridges menswear and streetwear, and now it has the backing of the largest luxury conglomerate in the world.

LVMH — the corporation behind Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Off-White, and more — has acquired a minority stake in the Queens-born brand founded in 2014. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, including how much LVMH paid and what percentage of Aimé Leon Dore it now owns, but The Fashion Law reports similar investments typically come in the range of $2 million to $17 million.

“LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth for Aimé Leon Dore,” brand founder Teddy Santis said in a release.

Aimé Leon Dore

A new era for streetwear? — Aimé Leon Dore, often referred to as “ALD,” has helped guide heritage brands including New Balance and Woolrich into the world of hype as it itself has become one of the hottest brands around. While its product drops often garner the same amount of attention to Supreme, ALD is rooted as much in menswear as it is streetwear and played its part in ushering in a more a slightly preppy trend that goes beyond T-shirts and hoodies.

The most apt comparison for Aimé Leon Dore is Noah, which itself was founded by former Supreme creative director Brendon Babenzein. Both put more handsome apparel including suiting, knitwear, and proper trousers, with Noah rooted in Long Island culture and ALD in Queens. Babenzein’s success with Noah was rewarded with a new post as J. Crew’s head of menswear, but it’s Aimé Leon Dore that’s made a more exerted effort to become a high-profile player in fashion.

Hype for Aimé Leon Dore can be seen in its rapid sellouts and a perpetual line for both its store and cafe in the Nolita neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Women’s Wear Daily reports the brand plans to expand with a new outpost in London set to open as soon as March, but that may just be the beginning of ALD’s growth now that LVMH is involved."

"LVMH Sales Top $71 Billion in 2021, Helped By Fashion & Leather Goods - The Fashion Law","Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtc2FsZXMtdG9wLTcxLWJpbGxpb24taW4tMjAyMS1oZWxwZWQtYnktZmFzaGlvbi1sZWF0aGVyLWdvb2RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sales for LVMH amounted to 64.2 billion euros ($71.55 billion) for the 2021 fiscal year, an increase of 44 percent compared to the year before and 20 percent compared to pre-pandemic 2019, the French luxury goods group reported on Thursday. Organic revenue growth was up by 36 percent and 14 percent compared to 2020 and 2019, with the group saying that its performance for the year “confirms a return to strong growth momentum following the severe disruption to the first half of 2020 resulting from the global pandemic,” and noting that “within the context of a gradual recovery from the health crisis,” it is “confident in its ability to maintain its current growth momentum.”

Delving into the performance of Fashion & Leather Goods over the course of 2021, Bernard Arnault-led LVMH revealed that its largest division “reached record levels,” with revenues totaling 30.8 billion euros ($34.32 billion) for the year – up from 21.2 billion euros and 22.2 billion euros in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating margins were up for 2021, as well, totaling 41.6 percent (from 33.9 percent and 33 percent in 2020 and 2019). These results were helped along by a strong fourth quarter, according to the group.

Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Celine, and Loewe achieved “record levels of revenue and profitability,” while Marc Jacobs “also performed particularly well.” (The big name missing here is, of course, Givenchy.) Louis Vuitton and Dior, in particular, turned “an exceptional performance,” complete with enduring rises in profitability, which LVMH confirmed was “already at an exceptional level.” Specifically, Dior – which saw the success of its new Caro bag and its caning pattern, as well as strong demand for micro bags, and the launch of seasonal capsule collections – boasted “exceptional growth in all its product categories among local customers” over the course of the year. Meanwhile, demand for Louis Vuitton was driven by its “reinvention of iconic models,” along with new artistic collaborations.

Speaking of local customers, LVMH management stated during a post-release call with analysts that local customers “are getting more selective in terms of brand choice,” with the group attracting new local customers in Europe to compensate for the lack of Asian tourists. Also worth noting: LVMH management stated that under the watch of creative director Hedi Slimane and CEO Séverine Merle, Celine has one of the fastest growth rates in the industry.

In terms of Fashion & Leather Goods sales by region, LVMH said that sales in the United States and Asia – which account for the majority of revenue – rose “sharply” in 2021, followed by Europe, finally returned to growth in Q4 compared to 2019, and Japan “with more limited growth.”

Turning to the Watches & Jewelry division, LVMH saw “a strong rebound of activity in own stores and the successful integration of Tiffany & Co.,” which helped to send revenues up by 167 percent in 2021 compared to 2020, and boosted profits from recurring operations almost six times compared to 2020 and up 128 percent compared to 2019. The division generated the bulk of its sales in Asia (excluding Japan) and the U.S., which LVMH says are “the best performing regions.” Tiffany, alone, saw “record performance in terms of revenue, profits and cash flow, and increased its global attractivity as a result of its high impact innovations and collaborations” during its first year under the LVMH umbrella. The New York-headquartered brand – which benefitted from “strong interest” in its Knot collection, and the rapid development of iconic lines T and HardWear – was also responsible for “increased intangible assets” and “increased inventories” for the division.

Elsewhere in the group, the U.S. was responsible for the greatest increase in Perfumes & Cosmetics sales, which grew by 27 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. LVMH specifically highlighted the “enormous success” of Dior’s Miss Dior and Sauvage fragrances, noting that in 2021, Sauvage became the highest selling fragrance in the world (women’s and men’s lines, included), which is “a worldwide first for a male fragrance.”

Selective Retailing, the division that houses the likes of Sephora and duty-free venture DFS, saw organic revenue rise by 18 percent compared to 2020 but was nonetheless, down by 18 percent compared to 2019 due to the impact of travel retail. While DFS suffered from “the very limited recovery in international travel, travel restrictions in China, and quarantine measures in Hong Kong,” not all was lost, as growing demand from local customers helped to boost sales at the seven T Gallerias outposts in Macao. Still yet, Sephora helped buoy the Selective Retailing division by “surpassing its 2019 level of activity, benefiting from the strong rebound in its stores and the continued momentum of its online sales.”

In addition to growing e-commerce sales for Sephora, LVMH also pointed to Loewe and Marc Jacobs, stating that Loewe’s “online sales grew significantly” and Loewe enjoyed “a highly impressive surge in online sales.” In what is likely a nod at least in part to the role of e-commerce, LVMH states that “investments in [Celine’s] omnichannel strategy played a key role in the Maison’s new gains.”

As a whole, the group reported “continued strong growth of online sales alongside the gradual return of customers in stores,” noting that in terms of efforts, including continued online endeavors, it “made the choice to keep the distribution [of its major Maisons] highly selective, limit promotional offers and develop online sales through their own websites” in order to “preserve their exceptional image – a key element of their lasting appeal.” Going forward, LVMH says it expects to double-down on “the digitization of its Maisons to enrich customers’ experiences online and in stores.”

In a post earnings call on Thursday, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault stated that he believes that the group “has enough wiggle room to raise prices” – which has been a common move across the luxury landscape over the past couple of years, in particular – “and protect its margins in an inflationary environment,” per Reuters. He cautioned, however, that management has to “remain reasonable” when it comes to boosting prices of the group’s offerings in the year ahead.

On the topic of group’s ambitions on the metaverse, LVMH does not appear as gung-ho as some of its rivals, with Arnault saying that LVMH “is not interested in selling 10 EUR virtual shoes,” noting that “at this stage, we are very much in the real world, selling real products.” On this same note, he further asserted, “We have to be wary of bubbles,” he said. “At the beginning of the internet, there were all sorts of things popping up and then the bubble burst. There may be relevant applications, but we have to see what universes might actually be profitable.” In terms of NFTs, in particular, Arnault stated that “it will be interesting to see how it generates profit, [as] NFTs are generating profits, and I’m sure this will have a positive effect if things are done properly.”

As for what the group is interested in is what Arnault called “more useful features in the future to support real life activities,” as indicated by LVMH’s recent expansion of the Aura Blockchain Consortium, which now includes Aura SaaS, a blockchain-based platform that aims to “help brands to address authenticity, ownership, warranty, transparency and traceability … [with] lower license and onboarding fees.”"

In an annual presentation to investors, Arnault made it very clear that the company is in absolutely no rush to sell virtual fashion.

Business of Fashion reports that Arnault is considering possibilities and “monitoring developments in the space, and is interested in the potential applications of NFTs.” Arnault said, “At present we’re in the real world selling real products. Surely it’s captivating, it’s interesting, it’s fun. But we have to see what the application of the metaverse and these NFTs will be.” He continued to add that while it is very possible that entering into the metaverse could have a “positive impact on our brands” he understands that if it is not “well done” it could lead to catastrophic outcomes for the business. In an apparent slight jab to its Kering competitor, Gucci who launched its NFT sneakers last March, which ultimately sold for approximately $12 USD online, Arnault said, “It’s not our objective to sell virtual sneakers for 10 euros. We’re not into that. But there may be more relevant applications.”

Arnault seems to be quite firm on his stance about not rushing into the NFT space and it appears that LVMH will take the road of precaution before fully entering into the metaverse.

LVMH & Bernard Arnault Aren't Sure About Designer NFTs - Highsnobiety,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1tZXRhdmVyc2UtbmZ0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault of LVMH isn't keen on plunging into the metaverse — he'd rather ease his way in.

Speaking to the press about the luxury conglomerate's performance in Q4 of 2021 (spoiler alert: they did well), the CEO expressed his hesitation to fully embrace fashion's digital frontier.

""It’s a purely virtual world and until now, we are in the real world and we sell real products,"" Arnault said. ""To be sure, it’s compelling, it’s interesting, it can even be quite fun. We have to see what are the applications of this metaverse and these NFTs.""

The executive assured went on to assure onlookers that LVMH, an arbiter of luxury, won't put its name on any old digital collectible.

""We’re not interested in selling virtual sneakers for 10 euros,"" he said, clarifying that well-executed NFTs and other digital activations ""probably"" have a positive effect on brands.

But LVMH — which owns major names including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Givenchy — isn't exactly as meta-averse as Arnault suggested.

Last summer, Louis Vuitton launched a free mobile game featuring 30 NFTs designed by Beeple.

Givenchy also took to the blockchain with a series of Chito-illustrated avatars, which sold for sums as high as 5 ETH (worth approximately $12,325 at the time of publishing).

And earlier this month, Fendi and Ledger teamed up on a series of high fashion crypto wallets (which, some have noted, shouldn't be flaunted in public).

Fashion's continued expansion into the metaverse is inevitable, given the lucrative nature of NFTs and the popularity of illustrated apes, so it's surprising (and a bit refreshing) to hear Arnault take a more cautious approach to the blockchain.

Maybe he still has PTSD from the Boo.com debacle?"

The French businessman is the driving force behind some of the biggest luxury fashion brands in the world. The central rationale of this discussion is to explore more about Bernard Arnault, his entrepreneurship journey, and the approach he used to create the world’s largest luxury empire. The discussion will analyze Bernard Arnault as the CEO of LVMH. The essay will document the attributes that made LVMH become a household name. The main approaches that Bernard Arnault used to make LVMH dominant are acquisition strategy, transformational and visionary leadership, and manufacturing unique products.

Bernard Arnault as the CEO of LVMH

Bernard Arnault is a French entrepreneur born on March 5, 1949. He is the founder, CEO, and chairman of the LVMH. The corporation LVMH is a group of many companies that deal with the manufacture and sale of luxury products such as designer clothes, fragrances, leather products, and alcoholic drinks. The luxury conglomerate consists of more than fifty luxury brands including, Fendi, Dior, and Louis Vuitton. LVMH Company has been regarded as the world’s largest marketer and retailer of luxury brands and products (Chen, 2021). The French company, located in the heart of Paris, has been built into a billion-dollar company through the keen leadership of Bernard Arnault. Because of his stern leadership and excellence in the fashion world, Bernard Arnault has been regarded as the “pope of fashion.” In one of his statements, the CEO of LVMH stated that the company’s role was to sell dreams. He added that his vision in LVMH was to make his company’s dreams a reality.

Manufacture of unique products

The brands that makeup LVMH today might have compromised on many factors but do not compromise on uniqueness. The different brands aim at making unique products that will satisfy customers’ demands and enable the brands to remain competitive in the market. Some of the major fashion and leather goods brands within LVMH include Emilio Pucci, Donna Karan, and Fendi (Donze, 2018). The cosmetic and perfume brands include Acqua di Pama and Guerlain. The watches and jeweler brands include Chaumet and Bulgari. One of the major challenges of LVMT brands is counterfeit and fake products. Louis Vuitton, for example, spends more than 10 million dollars annually in fighting counterfeit products from Turkey, China, Thailand, South Korea, and Italy. However, the CEO of LVMH stated that they seek to broaden their customer base, especially in rising economies such as India.

Utilizing the acquisition strategy

Bernard Arnault has built LVMH into the biggest luxury company by making multiple acquisitions. The CEO used the acquisition strategy to acquire companies dealing in fashion. The acquisition is one of the best strategies to participate in global markets. Owning this kind of investment requires a great commitment of capital and managerial efforts to regulate the vast portfolio. LVMH acquisitions have made it the majority shareholder in companies such as Marc Jacobs, Tag Heuer, Belvedere, and Christian Dior (Oliveira, 2020). The acquisition, joint ventures, and mergers allow LVMH to gain synergy, industry knowledge and skill, increased revenue, and diversification.

The company’s CEO believes that the surrounding he creates is just as important as the product. Products produced within the LVMH bear a mixture of luxury and art so that the clients feel special (Batat, 2019). LVMH has been keen on creating luxury apartments where customers can meet and have dinner-viewing parties. Clients can utilize these kinds of parties to do private shopping. The company has used exclusive parties as a marketing tool to display and advertise its products.

Entrepreneurship and leadership qualities portrayed by LVMH CEO

Advocating for creativity and innovativeness

With Bernard Arnault at the helm of LVMH, the company moved from a small clothing manufacturer to become a large conglomerate of more than 50 luxury brands, including Christian Dior, Dom Perignon, Hauer, and TAG. According to Arnault, one of his major reasons for the conglomerate’s success is his leadership and entrepreneurship skills. He states that coming up with a star begins with massive innovation and radical marketing techniques. His main aim was to work around creative people and deliver unique products to the market. Arnault states that he is very keen on creativity because that is the main secret that sells the company’s products (Donze & Wubs, 2019). For example, one of the designers, John Galiano, made dresses that resembled newspaper prints. Many people did not believe that this type of style would sell. However, when the style was sent down the cat-walk, it became one of the items that caught people’s eyes. Consequently, Dior sold many dresses that resembled newspaper prints and made considerable profits. The paradox of making clothes that resembled newspaper prints became an avenue to sell unique, modern, and highly profitable clothes.

Application of transformational leadership style

Arnault is keenly aware of the crucial role in creating and managing such an entity. He observes that many brands have untapped potential but might not become stars because they are poorly managed. He analyses that a brand should always be seen and treated like a person who needs and requires care. The brand enables the CEO to analyze how best it performs its role and improve that. A brand, just like a person, requires multiple inputs to become functional and beneficial to people who depend on it. Therefore, Bernard Arnault has always seen the conglomerate as a “person” who requires many inputs to perform well in the market.

Bernard Arnault has been regarded by many as a transformational leader because of the success he has amassed at LVMH Company. The company generally deals with fashion products, making it one of the toughest operating businesses. Bernard has been regarded as a transformational leader because he can keep pace with the many changes in the market in matters fashion. The fashion industry requires a leader who can identify the target customers and provide that. Arnault is one of the persons that has accentuated success in LVMH (Pandeya, 2019). The CEO of LVMH was keen on bringing together a team of committed people working for the world’s biggest fashion company. Through the transformational leadership of Arnault, the company has managed to rise to become one of the biggest companies in the manufacture and sale of perfumes, jewelry, and cosmetics.

Through the leadership of Arnault, a brand such as Christian Dior, Vuitton, and Fendi rose to become one of the most preferred companies in the sale of perfumes. While growing up, Alnault always wished to trade in luxury products, a dream that purchased him to purchase a Boussac. He sold the Boussac and later purchased part of the LVMH. Despite his limited knowledge in the fashion industry, Arnault had a deep passion for excelling and becoming dominant in the fashion industry (Raimondi, 2020). His strong leadership skis, authoritarian and transformational, made him gain control and grow. His ability to steer a global enterprise and promote creativity is one factor that made him a great leader and outstanding CEO.

Arnault was keen on running a big enterprise. He decided to acquire and merge several companies to form one big conglomerate. The acquisition started when Bernard Arnault learned about the sale of Christian Dior in 1984 (Antonaglia & Ducros, 2020). The acquisition went on with Arnault acquiring more companies such as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Berluti, Kenzo, Guerlain, Celine, and Loewe. Other companies acquired by the LVMP group include Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Thomas Pink, Heer, Gucci Group, Emilio Pucci, and Rassimoda. Arnault acquired other companies into LVMP to develop a stronger form that would take over the fashion industry. The merging and acquisition were also used as a growth and expansion strategy. In the present day, LVMP has more than 2,500 stores globally. The control of information is very necessary across the retail network of LVMH.

Maintaining a functional network between different departments.

Another crucial element that Arnault has utilized to grow the LVMH is the enterprise resource planning systems used to centralize the company’s information. All departments within LVMH are expected to share information about the company’s flow of goods and services (Schmitt et al., 2021). Sharing of information improves communication throughout the company. For example, the main role of LVMH is to focus on the manufacture and sale of luxury products. Sensing a change of fashion is vital to the company to work on that change. The research department has been keen on ensuring that they are at par with the market demands. The research department also gets customers’ feedback and researches how they can fulfill their needs. If the fashion trends have changed, the research department will quickly adjust. All changes within the company will be communicated throughout all departments. The product design department will look at the information presented and decide whether there is a need for changes in design. This collaboration between different departments has made it easy to implement changes within LVMH. High collaboration and communication between departments enable the company to enact changes faster.

Improved financial and cost management

In rapidly changing economies, many individuals and companies go bankrupt, including those that used to go wealthy. The LVMH conglomerate deals in the sale of luxury products. Part of the clients can use mortgagees to purchase and pay for them in installments. If the customers go bankrupt, the company will suffer many bad debts, automatically leading to losses. The company has provided its customers with various options to purchase products. The company provides an avenue for customers to purchase products and pay for them in installments.

The ERP systems integrated into the company’s operations improve cost management. For example, the manufacturing department in the company is expected to come up with the number of products required in the market. LVMP must control the number of products they produce by balancing demand and supply. The ERP systems help the company only manufacture products that will satisfy the demand in the market. The ERP has been fundamental to the company because it helps the firm avoid purchasing surplus materials that might not be needed.

Establishing a robust supply chain

The supply chain in LVMH includes getting raw materials, product design, manufacturing products, and distributing them to the final customer. The ERP system is part and parcel of the supply chain in LVMP. The supply chain function is the very heart of all businesses. The supply chain in LVMH encompasses multiple skills that come up with the beautiful designs seen at the stores (Borstrock, 2021). The supply chain manager in LVMH, Alain Doudard, stated that his team had to develop the best practices to speed up processes in the supply chain. An efficient supply chain is vital to delivering an excellent customer experience. The supply chain is also responsible for ensuring that the products that reach the final customer are in good shape.

The supply chain in LVMH continually adapts to align with the latest innovations and transformations in the fashion industry. For instance, LVMH recently adopted the supply chain at Ecole Paris (Mase, 2020). The main aim of this collaboration is to have close relationships with future graduates from engineering schools. The central role of the company’s supply chain process is to enable quality products to be manufactured under scrutinized positions. Employees whose well-being is well-maintained manufacture LVMH products in remarkable facilities. The employee’s health and safety are well taken care of in the manufacturing process in LVMH. The manufacturing of products in LVMH is keen on ensuring that environmental sustainability is preserved (Cavender, 2018). For example, the supply chain for Loius Vuitton leather products was given the ISO 14001 to comply with the global environmental conservation standards.

Conclusion

LVMH, led by Bernard Arnault, has pursued a consistent approach to developing unique products. Bernard Arnault is a visionary leader who has been the main reason for LVMH’s success within the fashion industry. Under his stern leadership, LVMH significantly improved the quality of its acquired brands and made them outstanding. Arnault never compromised on the company’s shortcomings but rose above the challenges to bring one of the most stable fashion legacies. The company has produced selective, quality, and detailed-oriented products to attract customers and keep them hooked. One aspect that is quite evident with LVMH products is that they overwhelmingly meet the expectations of its customers. The company has also incorporated the preferences of customers from different cultures. For example, in places like Japan, the customers demand and have an eye for details. Therefore, LVMH has integrated the architecture of different cultures into its products.

LVMH Takes Minority Stake in Aimé Leon Dore—Here's Everything You Need to Know About the NYC Brand - Grazia USA,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:14:05 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2dyYXppYW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS91cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdm1oLXRha2VzLW1pbm9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWFpbWUtbGVvbi1kb3JlLWhlcmVzLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmcteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC10aGUtbnljLWJyYW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury conglomerate LVMH has just acquired a minority stake in the New York-based brand Aimé Leon Dore, through its investment arm, LVMH Luxury Ventures. With the backing of the global fashion group, the collegiate-inspired streetwear label will continue to expand under the groups’ guidance. The brand, founded in 2014 by Teddy Santis, has gained a large cult following, establishing a sector all its own within the streetwear space, collaborating with heritage brands—from New Balance to Clarks—and honing their signature new-nostalgic aesthetic. Existing under the LVMH umbrella will open up many markets for Aimé Leon, and expand their outreach—basically if you’re not familiar with the brand, be prepared to see a lot more of them going forward.

So, let’s get to know the brand more shall we?

Born in nyc:

Founded in 2014 in NYC, Aimé is a love letter to New York. The label draws heavy influence from its founder’s upbringing in Queens, NY. Inspired by the streets, people and communities, of NYC, Aimé picks up on all of that. From basketball references–inspired by Santis’s upbringing playing basketball—to observing the business casual dress of people in the streets. And what about the name? After being denied a trademark for just Aimé (the French word for love), Santis added Leon, his father’s nickname, and then Dore, (the final syllable of his full name Theodore), hence Aimé Leon Dore!

Signature Prep athleisure aesthetic:

Aimé has carved out a distinct aesthetic, building on their own house codes with every drop, collaboration, and collection. It’s a bit preppy (with its collegiate, traditional staples), one part normcore (sweats, New Balances, the 90s inspired denim and silhouettes), throw in some workwear inspirations, and some Saville Row undertones—and that’s the signature Aimé aesthetic.

collaborations:

Aimé is a brand that stays true to its design ethos. Their signature preppy normcore meets athleisure aesthetic stays a consistent through-line throughout everything they do—from campaigns and branding to collaborations. Over the span of the past seven years, they’ve collaborated with brands that naturally fit into the Aimé Leon universe. Take their longstanding collaboration with normcore stable shoe brand, New Balance for example. The Aimé Leon Dore x New Balance sneakers have become quite the coveted release, making for a collaboration that just effortlessly gels. The brand has collaborated with Clarks, British label Drake’s, and American heritage outdoor wear brand Woolrich."
"LVMH Watch Week Includes Tag Heuer, Gears Up for Watches & Wonders - WWD","Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy1uZXdzL3dhdGNoZXMvdGhpcmQtbHZtaC13YXRjaC13ZWVrLWluY2x1ZGVzLXRhZy1oZXVlci1nZWFycy11cC1mb3Itd2F0Y2hlcy13b25kZXJzLTEyMzUwNTMxNjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — For the third year running, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton kicked off the luxury watch industry calendar on Monday with the LVMH Watch Week presentations from its labels Bulgari, Hublot, Zenith and now, Tag Heuer.

Owing to the Omicron variant, this edition shifted back to a mostly digital format, with houses showcasing their latest designs to press and retailers through virtual conferences and, owing to Paris Couture Week, limited physical presentations.

In a statement unveiling the event, Stéphane Bianchi, chief executive officer of the LVMH watches and jewelry division, described the four-day digital showcase as a moment to “shine a light on the momentum of [the group’s] four maisons.”

House executives were upbeat and keen to set a brisk pace of new designs and technical evolutions with the week, and make a mark in an expanding market.

“The trend of the industry is positive, and one of the reasons is that money is still there, as is the client’s desire to acquire beautiful objects, especially when they have less opportunity to travel and live experiences,” said Zenith’s CEO Julien Tornare.

Exports of Swiss watches, a key industry indicator, rose 2.1 percent over the first 11 months of 2021, despite a contraction of the Asian market.

Tornare attributed these good results to “long-term work over the past few years. Despite COVID-19, we worked a lot, stayed in touch, did a lot of digital and won market shares.”

Although LVMH does not release individual figures for its houses, he noted that 2021 had been a record year for Zenith since its acquisition by the French luxury group.

He revealed plans to open the first boutique in Saudi Arabia; expand the company’s operations in China with new stores in cities without a Zenith retail presence, and reinforce its American presence with franchised boutiques.

Among the models presented were matte-finished white ceramic Defy 21 Chroma with touches from all colors of the spectrum; the Defy Midnight Sunset and Borealis, which will have options for bracelets using materials from deadstock textile specialists Nona Source, and the Defy Skyline, featuring the new automatic El Primero 3620 manufacture calibre.

“We are aiming to increase production this year substantially…due to an increased appetite [for watches] that emerged this year. I’m not favorable to creating artificial rarity, because although it made certain models very successful, consumers eventually turn their attention elsewhere,” Tornare said.

For its first full participation, Tag Heuer showcased 11 new models in its Aquaracer Professional Series line. “They aren’t [just] new models, it’s a redesign to clarify both the offer and the range,” said CEO Frédéric Arnault.

Its flagship model is the Aquaracer Professional 200, with a sleeker silhouette and a slenderer profile, functional for speed flying or ice skiing but also adapted to more sedate daily activities, according to the executive. Automatic and quartz options will be available across the range.

Also kicking off during LVMH Watch Week was the 60th anniversary of the Autavia collection, a line created in 1962 by Jack Heuer, who drew inspiration from a dashboard timer that could go from car to airplane — hence the name, a portemanteau of automobile and aviation.

Three new models will join this collection: two flyback chronographs featuring the Calibre Heuer 02 COSC Flyback manufacture movement, and a three-hand GMT model with the Calibre 7 COSC GMT movement.

“But these are just a taste of what’s to come. We’re going to have a very rich first semester, with very strong stories — some that will be revolutionizing the watchmaking world,” said Arnault, noting that Watches & Wonders in Geneva would be the next big milestone where the brand’s major contingent of new releases will be showcased.

Among the developments to be shown, there will be smaller sizes to accommodate smaller wrists, including female customers; mechanical evolutions and increased creativity on watch faces; upgrades on existing specifications such as autonomy, and “a fitness experience, to further invest in sport,” he said.

Jean-Christophe Babin, Bulgari’s CEO, explained that in order to address the requirements of retail partners that need to “see, buy and resell now, not in eight months,” its releases had been structured around three moments: “the LVMH Watch Week, April where we will show at the same time — but not integrated to — Watches & Wonders, and September, with the Geneva Watch Days.”

A highlight for January are the Serpenti Misteriosi secret-watches, containing the minute Piccolissimo mechanical movement with its 12.30mm diameter BVL 100 calibre made to be housed in the snake’s head, and the Octo Roma Emerald Grande Sonnerie and its four-gong mechanism.

Babin also opened up about the Roman high jeweler’s direction for the coming year, in a context where local needs — served physically or digitally — take pride of place.

“The road map for e-commerce that we had set out to accomplish in five years, we did in 18 months,” he said, noting that the Roman house had gone from seven e-commerce sites in 2020 to 28 by the end of 2022, covering 90 percent of the worldwide luxury market potential.

That led to expanding lines to tailor to territory-based tastes. Take the Turbogas family, which will be expanded to include yellow-gold models. “It is structurally an important segment of the market, especially for the United States, where clients traditionally prefer yellow gold [over the other tones],” he said.

The precious metal was also front and center at Hublot, which had its 40th anniversary curtailed by the pandemic in 2020. The brand kicked off 2022 with a yellow-gold offer that nodded to its 1980s roots.

“The first fusion [we did] was to bring a rubber bracelet with a noble material, and when you say ‘gold’, people think of 24-carat gold, which is yellow — not rose, not white, not gray,” said Hublot’s CEO Ricardo Guadalupe.

Six models, drawn from the Classic Fusion, Big Bang and Spirit of Big Bang lines, were showcased in their gold-and-black livery, including a Big Bang Integral 40 with automatic caliber and an open dial. “Our identity is showing what is the soul of the watch — the movement,” he said.

The year will also see new variations on its tattoo-inspired watches, in partnership with the London-based tattoo studio Sang Bleu; the Big Bang Unico Golf Orange Carbon; as well as editions for the soccer World Cup in Qatar in November.

Describing 2021 as a “year of transition,” Guadalupe expected to ease into 2022 on a good footing, despite the Omicron variant and the shifting sanitary landscape.

For its female clientele, who currently amount to around 24 percent of Hublot’s customers and a segment Guadalupe hopes to grow to 30 to 35 percent, the newly launched Big Bang One Click 33 and its patented interchanging bracelet system comes with a rubber bracelet but also the possibility of choosing one of 12 new leather bracelets.

He expressed satisfaction at 2021’s results, which saw the label’s sales surpass those of 2019. He credited local consumers for these results, particularly in China and the U.S., where he expects the “incredible growth rates of 2021 to continue in 2022,” despite the impact of the so-called fifth wave of contaminations.

“In China, we rely on strong local partnerships, like naming [rapper] Lay Zhang ambassador, and developing our retail network, with the opening of five new boutiques last year. And of course e-commerce through WeChat,” he explained.

For the U.S. market, investing in localized advertisement had yielded a growth that saw 90 percent of Hublot’s sales within the country made to an American client.

Digital commerce will also continue to support growth, despite being only “a few percent,” by his admission. But a sale isn’t the only goal.

According to Guadalupe, even though some clients may click through to purchase a 20,000-euro watch remotely, digital was an “opportunity to create a connection to draw clients to know the brand better and transform sales” both on- and offline, or to offer quick turnaround on customer service troubleshooting. “One of the lessons of the pandemic is that keeping contact with your clientele even when your stores are closed allows you to keep working,” he concluded."

The growth was primarily led by the group’s largest earners, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

Louis Vuitton and Dior propelled a 28% increase in sales of fashion and leather goods — LVMH’s largest division — on a like-for-like basis. The group said revenues for the business in the last three months of 2021 came in 51% above their 2019, pre-pandemic level.

All LVMH divisions posted double-digit growth percentage-wise. The fastest pace was marked by the specialised distribution division which hit a 30% rise in revenue over the quarter as consumers flocked to stores amid the holiday period.

LVMH pointed to the United States as its best-performing single country for sales, with the nation accounting for 26% of the total seen in 2021.

LVMH full-year wine and spirits sales rise 26% - The Spirits Business,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwaXJpdHNidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS9sdm1oLWZ1bGwteWVhci13aW5lLWFuZC1zcGlyaXRzLXNhbGVzLXJpc2UtMjYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Nicola Carruthers

The wine and spirits arm of LVMH saw its revenue grow by more than a quarter in 2021, led by Hennessy Cognac’s rebound in the US and China.

LMVH’s wine and spirits unit, Moët Hennessy, saw sales climb by 26% to €5.97 billion (US$6.65bn) last year, of which €3.18bn (US$3.54) came from Cognac and spirits. Profit from recurring operations was up by 34% compared with 2020.

In total, LVMH’s revenue rose by 44% to €64.2bn (US$71.5bn) in 2021, compared with the previous year.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the luxury goods firm, said: “LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis.”

Hennessy Cognac reported an ‘exceptional performance’ over the past year, with volume up by 9%. Growth was boosted by the US, continued recovery in China, and acceleration in Europe and Africa, LVMH said.

The brand has established a global partnership with the NBA, expanded its production capacity and invested in a dedicated store network on the island of Hainan in China.

LVMH also reported an ‘unprecedented performance’ for its Scotch whiskies Glenmorangie and Ardbeg, in line with ‘ambitious innovation and growth plans’. In September last year, Glenmorangie opened The Lighthouse, the brand’s new multi-million-pound innovation distillery.

The company also noted ‘strong growth’ for its emerging spirits brands, American whiskey Woodinville, Volcán De Mi Tierra Tequila and Cuban rum Eminente, aided by the expansion of distribution and production capacities. Volcán De Mi Tierra Tequila and Eminente both entered the UK market last year.

Furthermore, LVMH said it had bolstered its online sales presence with the launch of Clos 19 in France, the Our Cellar site in the US and its joint acquisition with Campari Group of Italian e-commerce company Tannico.

Looking ahead, LVMH plans to ‘continue to strengthen its portfolio and accelerate the transformation and selectivity of its distribution’, as well as expand its range of experiences.

Furthermore, the company said it was committed to acting sustainability and significantly reducing its carbon footprint.

Arnault added: “Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence and are convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to further strengthen its lead in the global luxury market.”"
"Pierre Chausse, Deputy Editorial Director in charge of Digital at Le Parisien - LVMH","Sat, 15 Jan 2022 09:54:17 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx2bWguY29tL3RhbGVudHMvaW1tZXJzaW9uL2ZpcnN0LXBlcnNvbi9waWVycmUtY2hhdXNzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"My Métier d’Excellence

I’m deputy editor for digital content and organization at the French newspaper Le Parisien. This means I manage the teams that provide editorial content for our digital media, including new video formats, podcasts and social media. I’m also responsible for the organization of our editorial teams since this is directly impacted by Le Parisien’s digital transformation.

My background?

I actually first got into journalism when I was an undergraduate at law school and began writing articles about sports for a local paper in Poitiers. Then instead of applying to journalism school I decided to get a master’s in web editorial content, because I was really interested in digital content and I wanted to develop a distinctive skillset. I had a series of jobs in digital content with various publications before joining Le Parisien in my current position in 2016, when I was just 30.

An anecdote?

Two and a half years ago we launched a podcast called Source Code, an initiative I’m really excited about. The context wasn’t really favorable for this type of format at the time, especially internally, but we were able to get it up and running in record time, just three months. Today Source Code is the top news podcast in France. Most importantly, it really showcases our editorial department because we give our journalists a medium where they can report in depth on stories thanks to a long format that’s totally different from the print edition. People are telling us that they really discovered our journalists thanks to these podcasts, and that’s something I’m tremendously proud of.

My advice for someone starting out in this profession?

Don’t think you always need to take the “classic” educational route. Never stop learning about yourself and remain open to learning additional skills. For example, I learned to code a little and I’m pretty good with graphic design software, even though it wouldn’t seem to have much to do with journalism. But I think it helps better understand the digital world."
This is the new Moët Hennessy office space in Paris - Wallpaper*,"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:03:31 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGxwYXBlci5jb20vYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlL21vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktb2ZmaWNlLWJhcmJhcml0by1iYW5jZWwtYXJjaGl0ZWN0ZXMtcGFyaXMtZnJhbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new Moët Hennessy office in Paris is set in an appropriately glamorous location. The 10,000 sq m space is located on the upper floors of Le Bon Marché, the pioneering department store that was brought to prominence by the skills of Aristide Boucicaut, an entrepreneur who became a partner in the store in 1852.

Boucicaut transformed its fortunes, filling the structurally audacious and architecturally elaborate building with thousands of employees and all manner of goods. Le Bon Marché on rue de Sèvres was one of the first and greatest temples of consumption. It is still going strong, a major revamp having refined and restored the interiors in 2013.

As the ‘MH’ in LVMH, Moët Hennessy has earned the right to occupy this spectacular space within a landmark building that, after all, now belongs to its parent company.

(Image credit: Alessandra Chemollo)

The new Moët Hennessy workspaces were created by Parisian firm Barbarito Bancel Architectes, working in close collaboration with MH’s president, Philippe Schaus. Architects Ivana Barbarito and Benjamin Bancel set up their studio in 2011 and have done extensive work for Dior.

For MH, the main aim was to tailor the space to the company’s ethos, using the spacious attic spaces – once home to dormitories for the store’s female workers – to create a variety of different zones, from formal boardrooms, to meeting rooms, a dedicated bar, and a spectacular main space for working, reading, and conversation.

(Image credit: Alessandra Chemollo)

The art deco qualities of the original building have been overhauled, restored, and taken to new levels of elegance. From the tall arched windows set into the mansard roof, to the large light features that give the ceilings a flowing, sculptural quality, through to bespoke elements like the boardroom table and marble bar, the new offices evoke the grandeur of a bygone era.

The architects describe the result as an architectural space that ‘touches the sphere of the invisible, relating to individual feelings and favouring wellbeing that goes well beyond immediate comfort’.

Craft and quality are evident in every surface, with bespoke rugs underfoot, above carefully laid parquet flooring and alongside unique pieces of furniture, ceramics and stone finishes, as well as movable steel-framed glass partitions.

‘Moët Hennessy’s values have been a source of inspiration,’ say the architects, going on to list ‘excellence, know-how, craftsmanship, attention to detail, authenticity of materials, nobility without ostentation, the festive spirit, the pleasure of celebrating, the art of living, and the art of tasting’.

(Image credit: Alessandra Chemollo)

As well as views out across the Parisian skyline, the new offices overlook the department store’s inner courtyard, with its restored original steel structure supplemented by new planting.

Companies are under increasing pressure to lure workers back to their desks, meaning that office design plays a bigger role than ever before. As befits the world of their clients, Barbarito Bancel Architectes have gone all out to embrace richness, charm, and effortless class

Louis Vuitton Parent Company Confirmed As Buyer of Hotel in Beverly Hills - CoStar Group,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS83MTQ0NDYzMDYvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1wYXJlbnQtY29tcGFueS1jb25maXJtZWQtYXMtYnV5ZXItb2YtaG90ZWwtaW4tYmV2ZXJseS1oaWxsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An entity related to French luxury retailer and developer LVMH was the buyer of the former 80-room Luxe Hotel at 360 N. Rodeo Drive for an eye-popping $200 million, or about $2.5 million a room, according to public records and CoStar research.

The true buyer of the property and the price were not named when JLL issued a statement in December that the property had been sold. JLL represented the seller, Harkham Family Enterprises, a Los Angeles investment firm, in the deal. Newmark represented the buyer.

The manager of the buying entity, 360 N. Rodeo Drive LLC, is listed in public records under Dennis Ferrazzano, a partner at Chicago-based Barack Ferrazzano, the primary North American real estate counsel for LVMH.

Ferrazzano and an LVMH representative both declined to comment.

With the deal, the Louis Vuitton parent company is positioned as one of the largest hotel investors along the posh Rodeo Drive. Its first foray into the Rodeo Drive hospitality business came in April 2020, when it revealed it was redeveloping a former Brooks Brothers at 468 N. Rodeo Drive into a nine-story, 115-room Cheval Blanc hotel.

A building permit for the foundation for the Cheval Blanc hotel was sought around Dec. 14 with an estimated construction cost of $66 million, according to city of Beverly Hills records.

""This really speaks volumes to the value that high-end investors place on prime and world famous locations,"" said Alan Reay, president of Irvine-based hotel brokerage firm Atlas Hospitality Group. ""They will benefit from economies of scale in having two hotels, and it will also add real value and exposure to the Louis Vuitton brand.""

It's unclear what LVMH intends to do with the 360 N. Rodeo Drive property, which features retail space leased to Ferrari, Patek Philippe and Rolex. The Luxe Hotel there closed as international travel dried up during the pandemic.

LVMH's Cheval Blanc hospitality business operates hotels in Paris, the French Alps and on an island in the Indian Ocean near the Maldives.

The Hollywood-Beverly Hills hotel market still hasn't fully recovered from the pandemic and has an average occupancy of 58.6%, below the greater Los Angeles average of 66%, according to CoStar data. In February 2020, the market's occupancy was 81%.

The market's revenue per available room, a metric used to measure hotel performance, was $186.49, well above the greater L.A. average of $117.09, according to CoStar data."
Bernard Arnault in Wait-and-See Mode on Metaverse - WWD,"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtY2F1dGlvdXMtb24tbWV0YXZlcnNlLTEyMzUwNTY2NjEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bernard Arnault is in no hurry to charge into the metaverse — his brands are doing just fine in the real world.

Speaking after his luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported record full-year revenues and profits on Thursday evening, Arnault said while he was curious to explore the opportunities of the hotly hyped digital environment, he was also wary of a repeat of the dot-com bubble (LVMH was, after all, a major investor in the ill-fated Boo.com in the late ’90s).

“Let me start by saying that it’s a purely virtual world and until now, we are in the real world and we sell real products. To be sure, it’s compelling, it’s interesting, it can even be quite fun. We have to see what are the applications of this metaverse and these NFTs,” he said in a videoconference with analysts and reporters.

“If it’s well done, it can probably have a positive impact on brands’ activities. But we’re not interested in selling virtual sneakers for 10 euros,” the LVMH chairman and chief executive officer added.

“In conclusion, I would just say, beware of bubbles. I remember this from the early days of the internet, at the beginning of the 2000s,” Arnault continued, noting there are a multitude of companies building the metaverse. “There were a bunch of would-be Facebooks back then, and in the end, only one of them worked out. So let’s be cautious.”

The luxury magnate can afford to take his time. Revenues at LVMH totaled 64.2 billion euros in 2021, up 14 percent in organic terms versus 2019, with sales accelerating in the fourth quarter, fueled by its key fashion and leather goods division.

The group, which owns 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora, reported a net profit of 12 billion euros, up 68 percent compared to 2019, beating a FactSet consensus estimate of 10.9 billion euros.

Profit from recurring operations stood at 17.1 billion euros, up 49 percent versus 2019, considered a more reliable benchmark due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

Group revenues in the three months to Dec. 31 totaled 20 billion euros, up 22 percent versus 2019. The FLG division posted organic growth of 51 percent during the period, marking a sharp acceleration versus previous quarters, boosted by marquee brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, a record year at Celine and Fendi, and a strong performance at Loewe and Loro Piana.

Wines and spirits were up 4 percent; perfumes and cosmetics edged up 1 percent; watches and jewelry jumped 18 percent, driven by a strong performance at Bulgari, and selective retailing was down 5 percent, as travel retail division DFS continued to suffer from a sharp slowdown in international travel.

Touting the “exceptional” performance of Vuitton and a “record” year at Tiffany, Arnault said the outlook for 2022 was positive, despite the shadow of inflation. “The numbers for the month of January indicate a growth rate similar to the end of last year, so it was a very good start to the year,” he said.

While he doesn’t expect tourism flows to return to normal before 2023 or 2024, Arnault noted the group’s performance in Europe perked up in the fourth quarter, as brands worked to develop their local clientele.

“I think that things will continue to improve, but we have an advantage over a lot of other companies and other groups, which is that we’re able to have a certain flexibility on prices. So, in the face of inflation, we have the means to react, and I think that demand for our products will continue to be strong,” he added.

He cited the example of a Patek Philippe Nautilus steel sport watch produced in collaboration with Tiffany, one of a limited edition of 170 with a retail price of around $50,000, that was sold at auction in December for a hammer price of $5.35 million, with proceeds going to an environmental nonprofit.

“When it comes to price, everything is relative. What matters most of all is the quality of the product,” said the executive.

Nonetheless, Arnault cautioned against excessive price increases, in what appeared to be a veiled dig at Chanel. That brand has raised the price of its handbags four times since the beginning of 2021, citing production costs, though the move has been interpreted as a strategy to align its price points with rival Hermès in order to burnish the exclusive aura of its products.

“We don’t want to give the impression, like some brands do, of heading toward prices that no longer match the economic reality of the price of the products. You have to be reasonable. We try to be reasonable so that our customers feel that they’re dealing with brands that offer them something realistic, and not something that is artificially inflated, even if the products are very beautiful,” he said.

Arnault credited LVMH’s exceptional performance to the desirability of its brands and its increasingly sophisticated products.

“We sell much more than fashion,” he argued, citing the example of the Louis Vuitton show in Paris last week unveiling the last collection designed by Virgil Abloh, artistic director of men’s collections, who died in November at the age of 41 from a rare form of cancer.

The display, devised by Abloh before his passing, featured a soundtrack composed by Tyler, the Creator, played by an orchestra conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the music director of the Paris Opera, and choreography by Yoann Bourgeois.

“It was a performance, and that’s the spirit of Louis Vuitton. It’s much more than a fashion brand. It’s a cultural brand with a global audience,” Arnault said.

He paid tribute to Abloh, who last year was handed greater responsibilities at LVMH, in a deal under which the conglomerate gave him leeway to launch brands and seal partnerships across the full range of its activities.

“We are extremely sad. Nobody expected him to go this quickly. It’s a tragedy. He was an extraordinarily powerful creator. He was more than a fashion designer, he was a man of culture,” Arnault said. “We are still in mourning and I will talk about what comes next once this mourning period is over.”

In the meantime, the group is focused on the opening in early March of Dior’s renovated headquarters on Avenue Montaigne, said to include a restaurant, a museum and at least one suite. “I think it’s going to be an absolutely unforgettable event,” Arnault said.

And it will continue to invest in the turnaround of Tiffany, after completing its $15.8 billion purchase of the U.S. jeweler a year ago. LVMH has ramped up production of the T and HardWear lines; spruced up stores including the shop-in-shop in its Le Bon Marché department store in Paris, and launched a global advertising campaign featuring Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

“We made an excellent acquisition for the group,” he said, noting that sales at Tiffany grew strongly despite the loss of “several hundred million in revenues” due to the closure of its flagship in New York City, which is being completely remodeled and is set to reopen toward the end of the year.

Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony noted that with a free cash flow of 13.53 billion euros in 2021, up 119 percent versus 2019, LVMH had virtually offset the cost of the Tiffany purchase. LVMH plans to pay shareholders a dividend of 10 euros, up from 6 euros in 2020.

The strong results come after Compagnie Financière Richemont reported that revenues in the three months to Dec. 31 jumped 38 percent at constant currency rates versus the same period two years earlier. Kering is due to publish annual results on Feb. 17.

Wilkinson — who is the CEO of HEAT — told HYPEBEAST that the investment will allow the company to elevate, saying “HEAT has created a shopping platform for a digital generation, and we are positioned to make an impact in this space.” He added, “HEAT is here to disrupt the traditional approach to luxury fashion.” In short, this could mean anything from “implementing gamification [much like the recent news from Gap], AI-driven personalization, and interactive drops, all whilst driving sustainability,” according to Wilkinson.

HEAT offers two mystery boxes: one priced at £299 GBP (approx. $410 USD) and another at £500 GBP (approx. $687 USD), with both offering over £500 GBP and £850 GBP (approx. $1,167 USD) worth of products respectively. In the past, HEAT has teamed up with Haider Ackerman for a limited-edition box, and has also offered up a $440 USD YEEZY-filled box, however today, the brand works directly with Off-White™ and Casablanca, while also offering boxes filled with goods from LOEWE, Balenciaga, and more.

Speaking on the investment, Julie Bercovy, Founder and Head of LVMH Luxury Ventures, said, “LVMH Luxury Ventures is very pleased to support Joe and the team on their journey. With its mystery boxes, Heat is successfully pioneering a unique and virtuous model reconciling desirability, circularity and price accessibility. We are very impressed by the ability of Joe and the team to build such a robust and wide fan base in a short timeframe. The loyalty and enthusiasm of the HEAT community demonstrates the relevance of this approach and the desirability of HEAT’s curation.”

HEAT’s mystery boxes come in drops, and the next one is expected soon. Stay tuned to the company’s Instagram account for more information.

The head of the French luxury conglomerate and Europe’s richest man is in no particular rush to capitalize on the latest digital trend, unlike Louis Vuitton’s longstanding rival, Gucci, which has dove deep into the virtual realm, selling $12 USD virtual sneakers and embarking on a partnership with The Sims.

In an annual presentation to investors, Arnault explained his stance on NFTs, saying, “At present, we’re in the real world selling real products. Surely it’s captivating, it’s interesting, it’s fun, but we have to see what the application of the metaverse and these NFTs will be. It could surely have a positive impact on our brands — if it’s well done, but it’s not our objective to sell virtual sneakers for €10 EUR. We’re not into that. But there may be more relevant applications.”

Looking back on the history of technological innovations, Arnault cited the early aughts internet era, reflecting, “That was a bubble that burst. There were all sorts of things cropping up left, right and center. There were quite a few Facebooks, but only one pulled through.”"

The deal was made under its Luxury Ventures arm which focuses on investing in emerging labels. The value of the deal is undisclosed.

“LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth Aimé Leon Dore,” said ALD founder Teddy Santis at the investment announcement.

Under the deal, ALD will continue to be based at its New York headquarters and operate independently. LVMH will offer support and guidance to the brand. Sources told WWD that the brand plans to add to its current New York flagship with a London store early this year.

ALD was founded by Santis who is a Queens-born Greek-American designer back in 2014. By still adhering to his Greek heritage, Santis blends ’90s hip-hop references with a classic preppy aesthetic, resulting in an elevated and fresh take on streetwear.

Since its launch, ALD has gained popularity among fashion enthusiasts and streetwear fans, establishing its own cult following. Many celebrities, such as Emily Ratajkowski and Justin Bieber, have been seen wearing this brand.

It also has done collaborations with labels including Clarks, Drake’s and New Balance. Last year, Santis was appointed as the creative director of New Balance’s “Made in USA” line."
LVMH Luxury Ventures Takes Minority Stake in Aimé Leon Dore - Complex,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvdHJhY2V3aWxsaWFtY293ZW4vbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktdmVudHVyZXMtdGFrZXMtbWlub3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW4tYWltZS1sZW9uLWRvcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has been announced to have taken a minority stake in Aimé Leon Dore.

Per a report from Business of Fashion on Tuesday, LVMH Luxury Ventures—the Paris-based luxury conglomerate’s investment division—has taken a minority stake in the Teddy Santis-founded label in the form of an “undisclosed sum.”

To be clear, the ALD team will remain independent in terms of operation, which will continue out of its New York City offices. Moving forward, however, those operations will now be further emboldened thanks to “support and guidance” from the LVMH infrastructure. ALD, per a separate report from Women’s Wear Daily, is also said to be planning to open a London boutique.

Complex has reached out to a rep for LVMH for comment.

ALD, notably, was among those selected by Complex as the best brands of 2021. Highlighted in the ranking as the label’s biggest 2021 moments were the release of its second collab with Porsche and the launch of its second International Friendship Through Basketball campaign with New Balance.

Also last year, Santis was named creative director of New Balance Made in USA, marking what was billed at the time as the kickoff of a “multi-year relationship.” In a statement initially shared last April, Santis said the pairing represented a chance to share “authentic stories” via worldwide campaigns.

“I was drawn to New Balance for the way it has built a business founded on values such as integrity and authenticity, rather than passing hype,” Santis said at the time. “I see a tremendous opportunity to tell authentic stories with real people at the forefront, creating global campaigns that connect our core values with the world.”"
"From the Sea to the Sky, Here Are the Best TAG Heuer Drops From LVMH Watch Week 2022 - sharpmagazine.com","Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2hhcnBtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yNy90YWctaGV1ZXItd2F0Y2hlcy0yMDIyLXdhdGNoLXdlZWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From the Sea to the Sky, Here Are the Best TAG Heuer Drops From LVMH Watch Week 2022

January can be a bit of a drag, which is one reason why LVMH’s annual product showcase is something to look forward to. The other reason, of course, are the watches themselves. Swiss luxury watchmaker TAG Heuer was among a handful of top-tier brands (siblings in the LVMH corporate family) to drop a slew of new releases earlier this year, each of which speaks to a different aspect of the brand’s history and identity. From a new, sleeker version of the Aquaracer dive watch, to anniversary editions of the vintage-inspired Autavia, there’s a lot to appreciate here, so let’s dive in.

TAG Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200

Last spring, TAG Heuer made waves (if you will) by totally overhauling its Aquaracer dive watch. A relatively new addition to the TAG Heuer line-up, the Aquaracer officially debuted in 2004 but has its roots in a Jack Heuer-designed all-purpose sports watch, the Heuer Reference 844, from 1978. The results of the redesign were everything fans of serious professional dive watches could hope for, including a bold redesign of the case and 12-faceted bezel, and several 300m editions made to stand up to extreme conditions. This year’s new crop of Aquaracers carry the same stunning design, but are slimmer, smaller and designed to fit under a suit jacket cuff or over a wetsuit with equal finesse.

Aquaracer Professional 200 Date

The halo models of the Aquaracer 200 collection are this pair, whose dimensions have been slimmed down ever so slightly for easier wearability. Where the Aquaracer 300 is 43mm across the case, this new version clocks in at a much subtler 40mm, in addition to being slightly thinner. While these editions sacrifice the 300’s ceramic bezel insert in place of a steel one, they carry plenty of finesse in their dials which are decorated with repeating horizontal lines with a subtle fumé effect — which looks particularly good in the sea-blue version. Powering these two pieces is TAG Heuer’s workhorse Calibre 5 Automatic, with 38 hours of power reserve and a date function. ($3,450)

Aquaracer Professional 200 40mm Quartz

TAG Heuer has always been a great brand for value at the entry-level, and the Aquaracer Professional 200 delivers here too with a pair of handsome quartz versions. Aside from the battery-powered movement, this duo comes with the same horizontally-striped sunray dial with a choice of black or navy blue, a 60-minute unidirectional turning bezel, and white Super-LumiNova on the indexes and hands. ($2,550)

TAG Heuer Autavia

When Jack Heuer took the helm of his family’s watch brand in the early 1960s, he brought a modern sensibility and a new vision for sports watch design. In 1962 he launched the Autavia collection and simultaneously established a whole new design language that has guided the brand for the last 60 years. Before 1962, Autavia had been the name of a line of Heuer dashboard timers used in both cars and airplanes in the 1930s (hence the name, a portmanteau of “automotive” and “aviation”). To mark the 60th anniversary of Jack Heuer’s first Autavia collection, TAG Heuer is paying tribute to the watch’s influential design while pushing it forward into the 21st century with several key upgrades and two new complications, a chronograph and a three-hand GMT.

Autavia 60th Anniversary Flyback Chronograph

×

While a thoroughly modern watch on the inside, this edition of the Autavia borrows its bidirectional bezel from the 1960s original, and its chronograph pushers and extra-large crown from the 1930s Autavia dashboard timers. In another nod to the Autavia’s past — specifically its use by the German air force in the 1960s — this new model features a flyback chronograph powered by the new Calibre Heuer 02 COSC Flyback manufacture movement. Unlike traditional chronographs, which require pushing separate buttons to reset the counter, the flyback chronograph stops, resets and starts again with a single pusher — all the better for precision timing on the fly. The new Autavia chronograph is available in two versions, a silver “panda” dial with serious 1960s vibes, and a black DLC version inspired by TAG Heuer’s military history. ($7,850 / $8,650)

Autavia 60th Anniversary COSC GMT

×

In another tribute to the Autavia’s high-flying legacy, this model combines the watch’s midcentury looks with the functionality of a GMT complication that displays a second timezone via a dedicated orange hand. Fitted with the Calibre 7 COSC GMT movement — which, like the flyback chronograph is chronometer-certified for exceptional accuracy — the first GMT model in the collection stands out with a bright blue sunray-brushed dial, a blue and black ceramic bezel. Unlike the two chronographs which come with an alligator leather strap, the GMT model is available with an optional steel bracelet, and all of the strap and bracelet options are easily interchangeable thanks to TAG Heuer’s pushbutton quick release system.

What Does LVMH Luxury Ventures' Stake in Heat Mean for the Mystery Box Market? - The Fashion Law,"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3doYXQtZG9lcy1hbi1sdm1oLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4taGVhdC1tZWFuLWZvci1teXN0ZXJ5LWJveC1zcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mystery boxes are the latest target of investment for LVMH’s Luxury Ventures, with the French luxury goods conglomerate’s fund among the parties to a $5 million round raised by Heat. OTB Group board member and BVX CEO Stefano Rosso, Singapore-headquartered VC firm Antler, L Catterton partner Michael Mitterlehner, Spotify Director of Global Growth Sven Ahrens, and the Hermès family are some of the other investors in London-based Heat’s seed round, the funds from which will be used to “implement gamification, AI-driven personalization, and interactive drops, all while driving sustainability,” the company revealed on Thursday.

Founded in 2019 by 20-somethings Joe Wilkinson and Mario Maher, Heat offers up two luxury goods-filled mystery boxes to consumers – one priced at £299 ($410) and the other at £500 ($687), with both offering over £500 GBP and £850 GBP – in furtherance of its aim to “disrupt the fashion industry with innovative, immersive e-commerce experiences.” According to Hypebeast, Heat has partnered with the likes of Haider Ackerman for a limited-edition box, and has also offered up a $440 YEEZY-filled box. More recently, the company “works directly with Off-White™ and Casablanca, while also offering boxes filled with goods from LVMH-owned LOEWE, Kering-owned Balenciaga, and more.”

In addition to acting as a way for brands to market themselves to consumers by way of an exciting medium and thus, for consumers to discover brands outside of more traditional marketing channels, Heat touts the concept of “circularity” as an integral aspects of its model thanks to the fact that mystery boxes provide brands with a way of off-loading previously unsold merchandise without having to mark it down in stores (something that brands have increasingly tried to move away from) or opting to destroy products, a practice that has consistently plagued brands with bad press and that has become the subject of formal regulation in countries like France amid a larger global rise in attention to ESG among consumers, investors, and lawmakers.

As TFL reported last fall, brands have been looking to mystery and/or subscription box services, such as those provided by Heat, for this precise purpose: in an attempt to “innovate around the issue of dead-stock discounting.” This has prompted “a growing number of companies to combine the inherent appeal of subscription commerce with the thrill of unboxing to turn unsold goods into a surprise hit.” The subscription box trend ramped up in 2020, according to commerce-focused site PYMNTS, starting in the streetwear space before eventually “crossing into luxury goods, as brands from Balenciaga to Palm Angels and more get curated and sent to subscribers who do not know exactly what [they are getting].”

Heat co-founder Joe Wilkinson previously told WWD that this is, in fact, a driver for brands to turn to the quickly-growing mystery box company, as brands are looking for “a new way of getting rid of the stock that protects the brand values.”

By partnering with companies like Heat, brands presumably stand to gain the ability to more closely control what the use of their goods looks like – from what products are included (it would not be surprising if brands want to avoid their produced being being included up alongside those of certain brands or in conjunction with the offerings of any other brands at all) to how the boxes, themselves, are marketed. In much the same way as brands have responded to other budding developments in the industry, such as the burgeoning market for pre-owned products, partnerships with the likes of Heat and co. may be a way for luxury brands to test the water and may prove to represent the first step towards ultimately bringing endeavors like mystery and/or subscription boxes closer to home, either by building out an in-house venture or by way of M&A, making this an area worth keeping an eye on.

The investment of LVMH’s Luxury Ventures further increases the stakes in the space, as this would not be the first time that it has had its finger on the pulse when it comes to budding developments in the streetwear space. For instance, the fund – which was rolled out by LVMH in 2017 with the aim of buying stakes in “luxury companies with sales of between 2 million and 5 million euros ($5.4 million) and a high-growth potential” – invested in streetwear and sneaker reseller Stadium Goods back in February 2018, ultimately off-loading its stake in the company a year later as part of a $250 million acquisition by Farfetch. Luxury goods groups have since doubled-down on the secondary market for streetwear and sneakers, with GOAT Group announcing early last year that it would welcome a “strategic investment” from Groupe Artémis – the controlling shareholder of Kering – as it “continues its expansion in fashion apparel and new categories.”

Artémis has since invested in men’s fashion and streetwear-centric marketplace Grailed."

Sees “Remarkable Results” In 1st LVMH Year - JCK,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvdGlmZmFueS1jby1maXJzdC1sdm1oLXllYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. achieved “remarkable results” in its first year owned by LVMH, the luxury conglomerate said in its latest financial results.

The retailer “saw record performance in terms of revenue, profits, and cash flow,” it said.

LVMH officially took over the company on Jan. 7, 2021.

In the conference call following the release of the financial results, LVMH chair and CEO Bernard Arnault boasted that his company has been able to achieve a “turnaround” for the fabled brand.

“[The] luxury industry grew remarkably all the way up to 2019,” he said, according to a SeekingAlpha transcript. “But during these years, which was a period of growth, Tiffany stagnated. Both profit and revenue were flat. So we came at an opportune time.

“People said you’re paying a lot for that company, but I think it was not expensive at all. In fact, [chief financial offer Jean-Jacques] Guiony was able to pay it off very quickly. But it wasn’t such an expensive acquisition, considering and looking at the performance.”

He continued that, under previous ownership, Tiffany’s “shops lacked momentum, maybe some of them had to be redesigned, and business was sluggish…. We were able to turn it around and bring it up to extremely high performance.… We are very confident as to the future of Tiffany.”

He noted that the strong performances came in spite of the company’s New York City flagship being closed for renovations.

He said that Beyoncé’s rendition of “Moon River,” the theme from the 1961 movie Breakfast at Tiffany’s, which was featured in the retailer’s ads this year, caused people to “weep.”

As for as future acquisitions, Arnault said, “We’re in no hurry. I’ve been making acquisitions for the past 40 years. People tell us we’re making many acquisitions. We only have one every so often.”

This is a decisive move that will boost the career launched by Teddy Santis in 2014, founder of the New York-based brand created in Queens. Internationally renowned for his unique style and major collaborations with brands such as New Balance, Clarks and Drake’s, Aimé Leon Dore will now receive support and guidance from LVMH.

According to sources close to the company, the brand will continue with its New York headquarters but plans to expand its flagship store and expand its physical business to London.

“LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history of growing exceptional historic brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to drive the next chapter of Aimé Leon Dore’s growth,” said Teddy Santis in a statement."
"LVMH becomes ""cultural institute"" after record-breaking 2021 - Retail Detail Europe","Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGRldGFpbC5ldS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1iZWNvbWVzLWN1bHR1cmFsLWluc3RpdHV0ZS1hZnRlci1yZWNvcmQtYnJlYWtpbmctMjAyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2021 was another record year for LVMH, beating 2020 as well as pre-Covid 2019. The owner of famous brands like Louis Vuitton has faith in the future, but not in the metaverse – focusing on “selling culture” instead.

55 % profit rise

Both LVMH’s turnover and profit have reached record heights: net profit went up 55 % to 12 billion euros and turnover rose to 64 billion euros, 43 % more than in 2020 and still 20 % more than in 2019, the last year before Covid struck.

Performances were especially strong in North America and Asia, while Europe still struggled more with Covid restrictions. In terms of divisions, fashion and leather were the strongest performers.

CEO Bernard Arnault looks towards the future with a lot of confidence: the luxury conglomerate says it is in an excellent position to reinforce its leading position on the global luxury market.

“Metaverse is a bubble”

While the company looks towards a lot of different ways of expansion, conquering the metaverse is not one of them. Unlike competitors like Gucci or Burberry, LVMH distrusts the new virtual worlds. The somewhat conservative CEO, who earlier expressed his reservations towards Amazon (to put it mildly), warned everyone to be wary of the bubbles that are the metaverse initiatives, CNBC reports.

While relevant applications and business opportunities might come out of it, Arnault warns for caution and says further enquiries into profitability are advised. Regarding all these new fads, he only sees value in NFTs.

Not a fashion brand

Moreover, Arnault says LVMH is not scared of the skyrocketing inflation: he calls his group not just a fashion house, but a real “culturally creative company”. And that means that prices can still go up by quite a bit, within reason. Despite rising costs, LVMH’s margins still went up – meaning that sales prices rose even faster.

The luxury group now says it sells “desire” and “culture” more than it sells watches or jewellery. Flagship brand Louis Vuitton especially is said to be a cultural brand with a worldwide audience – including an important part of the Gen Z group. As evidence, Arnault gave collaborations with Beyoncé for the Tiffany & Co. marketing campaign and the posthumous fashion event to honour designer Virgil Abloh."
Hublot Unveils New Novelties At LVMH Watch Week 2022 - Haute Time,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vaHVibG90LWx2bWgtd2F0Y2gtd2Vlay0yMDIyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s been an exciting week as the highly-anticipated LVMH Watch Week has officially started. A week dedicated to the LVMH Group’s four watchmaking Maisons, LVMH Watch Week welcomes watchmaking professionals, experts, and industry tastemakers into the wonderful world of watchmaking, debuting the latest and greatest. For Hublot, this year marks a return of bespoke classics with a modern upgrade and select new novelties worth noting.

TIME ONLY: FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE BIG BANG INTEGRAL IN 40 MM

For the first time, Hublot has featured three pieces, three hands, three materials with just one diameter: 40 mm. This is a first for the Big Bang Integral—and an exclusively sleek design.“No-one was expecting it, so of course, we did it: a Big Bang Integral that is more compact, vibrant, and powerful than ever, at the same time as being more refined than any of its other timepieces,” explains Ricardo Guadalupe, the CEO of Hublot. “It has been a true exercise in watch design, retaining our aesthetic and technical grammar but in a totally new format for us. We pulled off the challenge by creating a Big Bang Integral, which once again proves its versatility and modernity!”

For a more trendier yet sophisticated approach, the Big Bang One Click 33s reveal their many facets and come with a new luxury of silky bracelets in a range of vibrant colors. “Hublot excels in flouting conventions, perfectly matching materials that are rarely seen together or have no natural affinity. It’s been a very long time since timepieces were synonymous with austerity. Precision is the common denominator of Haute Horlogerie and jewelry. The Big Bang One Click combines the best of both worlds by giving you the freedom to match your jewelry with your look,” says Guadalupe.

THE BIG BANG UNICO GOLF, ORANGE CARBON EDITION

Inspired by renowned American professional golfer Dustin Johnson, the Big Bang Unico gold watch—the first mechanical golf watch with aperture display—is back, but this time in orange carbon. Designed for the modern golfer, the watch is equipped with an exclusive shot-counting mechanism. “The combination of this great sport, this great champion, and this great mechanical golf watch continues to excite us, and we’re very proud to introduce this new version of what has become an icon in golf and in Swiss watchmaking,” explains Guadalupe.

THE MAGIC OF INKED TIME: THREE NEW MODELS OF BIG BANG SANG BLEU II

The Hublot x Sang Bleu collaboration continues, with three new Big Bang Sang Bleu II iterations. In the 7th year of collaboration, Maxime Plescia-Buchi chose to apply his ink to two iconic materials born from the Hublot Art of Fusion—Magic Gold and ceramic. We love these long-term collaborations, which allow us to combine, experiment with, and transpose our expertise and our vision to develop them and push them to new limits,” reveals Guadalupe. “Our ‘scratch-resistant’ materials engraved with the indelible lines of the Sang Bleu geometry imbue with even greater meaning the messages he conveys through his art: perfection, balance, precision, inalterability, and irreversibility.”

THE RETURN TO YELLOW GOLD

Last, but certainly not least, Hublot returns to its heritage. Six new Hublot pieces were exclusively unveiled at LVMH Watch Week that recaptured the original essence of the manufacture: the fusion of gold and rubber in a sporty chic aesthetic, at a time when, over four decades ago, the concept of the sport chic watch didn’t even exist."
Hennessy joins luxury blockchain consortium Aura - Ledger Insights - Ledger Insights,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZGdlcmluc2lnaHRzLmNvbS9oZW5uZXNzeS1qb2lucy1sdXh1cnktYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1jb25zb3J0aXVtLWF1cmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today Hennessy announced plans to integrate the Aura traceability blockchain. The spirits brand is the ‘H’ in LVMH, the luxury group that initiated the Aura project. LVMH has since been joined by founding members Prada, Richemont’s Cartier and OTB, which owns Diesel and other brands.

Hennessy wants to provide traceability for its spirits from the distiller to the customer as part of a sustainability drive. Aura’s initial objective was to prove the authenticity of luxury products, a simpler solution with only two parties, the brand and consumer. However, the same solution can also provide complete supply chain traceability, albeit with more steps along the way, enabling companies to demonstrate their sustainability credentials.

The spirits brand has already used Aura to prove authenticity for the collector’s edition of Hennessy Paradis sold in China during the Chinese New Year. Each buyer received an authentication certificate via WeChat.

This is not Hennessy’s only blockchain deployment. It is selling two limited edition bottles of its Hennessy 8 cognac in conjunction with the BlockBar marketplace. The online solution uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a digital twin for physical bottles of spirits held at a bonded warehouse. Buyers can choose to redeem the NFTs for the physical bottle or trade them.

Another Aura partner OTB is also active with NFTs and has created a division to target metaverse fashion, a major opportunity for the luxury fashion sector. And LVMH’s Louis Vuitton launched an NFT with Beeple art.

Aura itself is working on developing an NFT solution. Last week it launched its software as a service (SaaS) offering for its core authenticity and traceability product. This provides a simple solution to enable easy adoption of its technology. Rather than needing to set up blockchain nodes, companies can connect using APIs and use the solution with a white-label user interface. The platform was originally developed with ConsenSys and uses Quorum, a private permissioned version of Ethereum."

(IDEX Online) - Tiffany & Co enjoyed a record year, said the French luxury conglomerate LVMH which finally acquired the jeweler, for $15.8bn, a year ago.







""Profit from recurring operations was almost six times higher than in 2020 and up 128% compared to 2019,"" LVMH said, as it announced a 44 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue across all its brands to $71.5bn.





Its watches and jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of 167 per cent in 2021 compared to 2020 thanks to Tiffany's remarkable performance.





""For its first year in the group, Tiffany saw record performance in terms of revenue, profits and cash flow, and increased its global attractivity as a result of its high impact innovations and collaborations,"" said LVMH.





The company finally agreed to buy Tiffany in October 2020 - at a modest $425m discount - weeks after it walked away from the deal, citing a tit-for-tat war over US trade tariffs and a poor pandemic performance by Tiffany.





The move was aimed at strengthening its hand in one of the few luxury segments where it has not dominated.





It revealed plans to increase its gold, precious gems and watch sales, to revamp many of its 320 US stores and to expand its operations in Europe and Asia.

Union Claims Former Luxury Hotel Owner Violated Agreement On Sale to LVMH - The Real Deal,"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDEvMzEvaG90ZWwtdW5pb24tY2FsbHMtdGVybXMtb2YtZGVhbC1mb3ItbHV4ZS1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1pbnRvLXF1ZXN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A month after LVMH bought the Luxe hotel on Rodeo Drive, hospitality union Unite Here Local 11 has called the terms of the deal into question by filing a complaint with the former owner.

Unite Here Local 11 has filed a formal grievance, claiming the Harkham family, who formerly owned the hotel, failed to satisfy certain successorship provisions of a labor agreement with the union.

Under a collective bargaining agreement between the local union and Luxe Rodeo Drive, LVMH was required to assume the agreement, meaning it would continue operating the hotel with the same union provisions in place, according to documents seen by TRD.

Beverly Hills-based hotelier Efram Harkham, as the former owner of Luxe Rodeo Drive, was required to notify the union that LVMH had assumed the CBA. Unite Here Local 11 president Kurt Petersen said the union has not heard from either party.

Harkham could not be reached for comment. LVMH did not respond to a request for comment.

LVMH purchased the hotel for $200 million at the end of last year, sources familiar with the deal told TRD at the time. The 42,560-square-foot property at 360 North Rodeo Drive also includes three high-end retail storefronts leased to Rolex, Patek Philippe and Ferrari.

The 86-key hotel has been shut down since September 2020. At the time, Efram Harkham’s son, Aron Harkham, said that the property got “caught up with the bad timing of the global travel market.” At the same time, the firm terminated all of its employees, according to the union.

Under California’s Senate Bill 93, signed into law in April 2021, employers in the tourism and travel industries have to rehire all employees who were laid off during the pandemic when operations restat.

It’s unclear whether LVMH plans to reopen the property as a hotel. The house of luxury brands has not filed any plans for redevelopment with the city of Beverly Hills.

Unite Here has asked lawyers representing the Harkhams to move the complaint to arbitration and for a hearing to be scheduled “as soon as possible,” according to the grievance.

The Harkham family has until Wednesday to respond to the union’s grievance and provide documents related to the sale of the hotel to LVMH."
LVMH Plans New Dior Store on Rodeo Drive - The Real Deal,"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDEvMzEvZGlvci1qYWRvcmVzLWJldmVybHktaGlsbHMtbHV4dXJ5LXJldGFpbGVyLXBsYW5zLW5ldy1kaWdzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH cannot get enough of Rodeo Drive.

The Paris-based fashion and luxury house is planning to build a three-story Dior store with a restaurant to replace its existing men’s store at 319 North Rodeo Drive, according to documents filed with the city of Beverly Hills in October. LVMH owns a 50 percent controlling stake in Dior.

Dior is planning to demolish and excavate the existing 16,000-square-foot store and build a 47,900-square-foot structure, complete with underground parking. Each floor will have an outdoor courtyard.

LVMH has been busy along Rodeo Drive in recent months. In December, the firm bought the former 86-key Luxe hotel at 360 North Rodeo Drive for $200 million. Further down the famed street, the firm is developing a nine-story Cheval Blanc hotel at the former Brooks Brothers building.

LVMH bought the Dior store at 319 North Rodeo Drive for $85 million in 2012, records show. It also leases a space next door, at 315 North Rodeo Drive, for its women’s store, with an option to purchase that property.

The plans for the new Dior store also feature extensive outdoor dining — a trend borne out of necessity for restaurants during the pandemic, given indoor dining restrictions. Dior is planning to have 14 outdoor tables with a total of 46 chairs across 1,440 square feet of space.

The retailer already has a rooftop restaurant in Miami, located above the women’s store in the city’s design district.

Dior’s new plans come amid a slow time for Rodeo Drive, which has seen some stores exit the iconic street amid the pandemic. The trend could be shifting – the personal luxury goods market sharply rebounded in 2021, growing 29 percent to $317.9 billion in 2021, a 29 percent increase compared to 2020, according to Bain.

Dior recorded revenue of €64 million ($71.9 billion) in 2021 — a 44 percent increase compared to 2020 and up 20 percent from its 2020 revenue, according to a January financial report."
LVMH's Bernard Arnault breaks the Internet by flexing his ultra-rare Patek Philippe. - Luxurylaunches,"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3dhdGNoZXMvbHZtaHMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJyZWFrcy10aGUtaW50ZXJuZXQtYnktZmxleGluZy1oaXMtdWx0cmEtcmFyZS1wYXRlay1waGlsaXBwZS5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Bernard Arnault, chairman for LVMH, owns some of the most coveted luxury brands in the world. Some include Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Dom Perignon, Sephora, Tiffany & Co, and many others. Other than all these excellent brands, his recent possession caught the eye of the watch and luxury fans all over; a unique Tiffany Blue Patek Philippe 5740. The uber attractive watch was spotted on the billionaire’s wrist on Frédéric Arnault’s Instagram post. The father-son duo played a game of chess while wearing a kingly timepiece. Frederick is the CEO of TAG Heuer, and it speculated the watch he was wearing looked like a Tag Heuer Carrera. Still, the topic of discussion was undoubtedly the prestigious white gold perpetual calendar in the Nautilus family.





A close-up of the uncommon watch was also leaked, revealing a stunning Tiffany Blue dial and black and white hour markers and hands similar to the 5711 pieces. What makes this watch even more sought-after is the addition of black perpetual calendar sub-dial lettering and a moonphase window. This also means that the price tag on the excellent accessory is much higher than Tiffany Blue 5711 models, retailed at $52,635. It is nearly impossible to put a price on a 5740 unique piece.

Interestingly, the release of Arnault’s premium Patek Philippe makes the $6.5 million Tiffany Blue 5711 sold by Phillips seems almost like a standard watch. A lot of watch fans commented on Frederick Arnault’s post. One user noticed the Patek Phillipe on Bernard Arnault’s hands and wrote, ‘You can announce you have acquired Patek now.’ Another user, cheesycowboy commented, ‘This 5740 will break the internet.’ While most of the internet was left jaw-dropped at this exceptional watch, there were a few who didnt like the opulent timepieces or its blatant show-off.

Askar_t remarked, ‘Thanks for bringing Patek down to Hublot levels,’ while shameonwrist quipped, ‘I never thought that I would say this. But I would choose your Tag Heuer over that PP.’ To each his own, but Bernard can say Check Mate with that out-of-the-box Tiffany Blue Patek Philippe 5740!"

The Aura Blockchain Consortium currently has more than 15 million digital tokens on their own, private permission based blockchain platform which offers both up-stream and down-stream traceability in the supply chain which is direct to consumer.

The launch of Aura SaaS is the first blockchain based platform designed for luxury brands to help the luxury industry to embrace the blockchain in their day-to-day business operations including: supply chain, customer service, marketing, manufacturing, sustainability, purchasing, logistics, and legal. Aura SaaS will allow Aura member brands to quickly and easily onboard, maximising value focusing on the customer journey and digital innovation and allowing for both upstream and downstream traceability in the supply chain for consumers – making it one of the best direct to consumer offerings in the market.

Aura SaaS is a no-code solution that allows for a quick and hassle-free implementation.. There are also lower up-front costs, as Aura SaaS users benefit from lower license and onboarding fees. The launch of Aura SaaS will make Aura more accessible to luxury brands across the globe while strengthening the industry’s response to challenges such as counterfeiting and responsible sourcing.

With Aura SaaS, brands can easily access the Aura Blockchain directly through APIs and connect them to their own IT systems and applications. Main functionalities include:

Smart contract generator - no coding skills needed

Products registered on the blockchain

Product events / rich content management

Product history

Product ownership acquisition & transfer

On top of the blockchain functionalities and APIs accessible by luxury brands, Aura SaaS will offer various white-label front-end interfaces and web pages to easily write, read and display information from the Aura Blockchain – this will be fully customised to align with the UX of each brand, requiring no technical or blockchain expertise. These webpages can be also directly accessible by luxury clients. Aura SaaS helps luxury brands to address the following topics: authenticity, ownership, warranty, transparency and traceability targeting both upstream use cases (e.g. raw material sourcing) and downstream use cases (e.g. digital certificates of ownership and authenticity certified on the Aura Blockchain, e-warranty, transfer of ownership, etc.)

Daniela Ott, Secretary General of Aura Blockchain Consortium, said of the launch: “ Our ecosystem is growing on a daily basis and Aura's solution covers the entire lifecycle of luxury production and consumption. Aura SaaS provides a game-changing toolbox for the luxury industry with an easy onboarding, minimum costs and without the need to manage any Cloud infrastructure and deploying any instance, thus reducing the Time-to-Market to launch new blockchain use cases. This solution is meant to last and benefit the whole value chain. Given its accessible pricing, it is a solution suitable for luxury brands of any size, for most product categories within the luxury sphere.”

Alongside the Aura SaaS solution, the Aura Blockchain Consortium is also developing a suite of turnkey tools to accelerate route to market, with smaller brands in mind. These would include simple, ready-to-use front-end tools that can provide luxury consumers with a visualization of data on the blockchain. For example, brands could offer more transparency into their sustainability credentials by providing consumers with the ability to view the provenance of materials used in the manufacturing process. Such a solution is particularly attractive to brands yet to implement their own advanced front-end but are keen to offer customers more insights and interactions."

Dreams of a trip to snowy Switzerland may have been dashed by Omicron, nonetheless a ‘phygital’ affair ensued as Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith all unveiled killer new novelties for us to fantasise about adding to our collection.

From a sexy classic we fully expect to see Ryan Gosling wearing to a diamond-encrusted stunner we can see Cristiano Ronaldo courting, Robin Swithinbank gives us the lowdown on what was a stellar few days for watch lovers.

Zenith Defy Skyline

Everyone’s talking about Zenith – so let’s start with it. Aficionados have always had a soft spot for the venerable manufacture watchmaker, but it’s rarely had an ‘it’ watch. Last year’s Chronomaster Sport has become that, meaning the Defy Skyline arrives with Zenith in the ascendancy. Steely, sculpted and ever so slightly avant-garde, it’s defined by its 12 bezel facets, a repeating star dial motif and its time-only expression of Zenith’s El Primero movement, which in place of a chronograph fuels a small seconds that makes a full 360-degree tour in 10 seconds (instead of 60). Another hit? Absolutely. £7,100\"
DFS 'still held back' as LVMH post 36% growth - DFNIonline.com,"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xlYWQtc3Rvcmllcy9kZnMtc3RpbGwtaGVsZC1iYWNrLWx2bWgtcG9zdC0zNi1ncm93dGgtMjctMDEtMjAyMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The lack of international travel meant the LVMH travel retail business was “held back” in 2021.

The luxury group’s financial results, which were released this afternoon, paint a positive picture for its wider business, with a “record year” for many major brands. Recorded revenue across the group was up 44% year-on-year and increase 20% on the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019 to hit €64.2bn ($71.6bn). Meanwhile organic revenue grew by 36% compared to 2020.

However, the group’s Selective Retailing arm, which includes travel retailer DFS and Starboard Cruise Services, marked a year-on-year revenue increase of just 18% to hit €10.16bn. However, this still places it 18% down on figures recorded in 2019.

The T Gallerias remained a high spot for DFS Group, with the Macau outlets performing well thanks to local demand and the company’s debut in Hainan was cited as a positive move. Furthermore, the reopened La Samaritaine in Paris saw an “encouraging level” of traffic, according to LVMH.

DFS’ own revenue remained below 2019 levels, according to LVMH’s figures. A report published with the results said: “The health crisis continued to weigh on the activities of DFS due to the persistent weakness in the numbers of travellers.”

Across the whole group, LVHM, posted especially strong results in its Fashion & Leather Good business, with an organic revenue growth of 51% compared to 2019. This was driven by brands including Christian Dior, Fendi and Louis Vuitton. The United States and Asia were the driving forces of recovery, while Europe returned to growth in the fourth quarter.

LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis. The Group’s record results could not have been achieved without the efficiency and exceptional ability of our teams to adapt and notably to remain connected to our customers, continuing to inspire dreams, despite the crisis.”

He added: “The Group and its Maisons carried out numerous actions in 2021 to promote biodiversity, protect nature and to preserve skills and craftsmanship, and will continue to do so in the years to come. Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence and are convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to further strengthen its lead in the global luxury market.”"
Is LVMH getting into the mystery box game? - nss magazine,"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8yODY0MS9sdm1oLWhlYXQtbXlzdGVyeS1ib3jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Heathis an English start-up that has made a lot of talk about itself in recent times for its original way of revolutionizing luxury retail: users pay a fixed price based on the size of the box to buy a mystery box that contains various items of luxury brands. A very simple yet brilliant idea, also thanks to a very attentive presentation and selection of brands, which attracted a number of high-level investors during the most recent round of funding: LVMH and the partner of its investment fund L Catterton, Michael Mitterlehner; Stefano Rosso of the OTB group and the Hermès family, as well as the Antler company. The new capital will serve to improve Heat's e-commerce experiences such as gamification, AI-driven personalization and interactive drops. In general, however, the participation of these large luxury groups in the financing of the start-up, which currently has offices in the UK and Milan, suggests Heat's intention to expand further into Europe and the US – especially since the range of brands it collaborates with has expanded to include brands such as Balenciaga, Loewe, Saint Laurent, Celine, Haider Ackermann, Casablanca, Jacquemus, JW Anderson e Off-White™.

The appeal of the retail format proposed by Heat is well understood: first, the format of the mystery box at a fixed price, with items from past seasons (but which are also including those of current seasons) represents an extremely elegant way for brands to eliminate unsold stock obtaining a profit without resorting to outlets; secondly, the mystery box represents a union of retail, circularity and entertainment, as the spread of the app has been accompanied by the spread of unboxing videos on social networks that record very high views and interactions; thirdly, mystery boxes also feed the resell, as those who receive items that they decide not to wear, can always resell them recovering in many cases all the value of the box with a single sale. A kind of win-win situation for brands, retailers, social media creators and customers that is having great success moving across all levels of the system.

LVMH is obviously interested in the format, which has already been used by brands such as Haider Ackermann and Represent for the launch of new products, as well as the other groups and brands dependent on them, and their participation in the financing of the start-up may suggest that the mystery box format will be enriched with special editions dedicated to this or that brand, or at least start to become a new element of luxury marketing – perfect for dialoguing with Gen Z, to acquire new customers, to launch new products but also increasingly refined thanks to the aforementioned investments in the field of AI to customize and automate the selection of products based on the individual customer."

This week marks the official beginning of a new year in watchmaking with LVMH’s Geneva Watch Week. It’s happening online, which means we can bring to you direct the brand-new launches, unveiled a few hours ago, from some of the luxury group’s storied Swiss brands.

Never knowingly understated, Hublot has been a celebration of cold hard flash since its inception in 1980. Founder Carlo Cracco’s first design, the Fusion, paired solid gold with natural rubber straps for the first time in a watch that looked like no other. It was a polarizing move and the first of many that didn’t always sit comfortably with the prevailing traditional sense of Swiss luxury.

When the watch industry’s favorite maverick, Jean-Claude Biver, joined the brand in 2004, Hublot took that DNA and supersized it. In 2005, Hublot launched the Big Bang, an outsize watch in a new sandwich case construction that managed all at the same time to be simple and complicated, elegant and unmissable. Even the name was a hearty, one-fingered poke in the eye of convention. It proved an instant hit, garnering major watch industry accolades the same year.

While much of Hublot’s out-of-the-box thinking of late has brought forth unforgettable limited-edition collaborations—like its recent Takashi Murakami flower watches—and new materials, like forged carbon, colored ceramic, and even colored sapphire crystal cases, it’s reassuring to know that in 2022, amongst all that innovation, there’s still nothing wrong with gold old yellow gold.

Yellow gold proved for a while (indeed for much of the past 20 years) something collectors linked with flashy 1970s and 1980s tastes. Much of the refined end of the industry stayed away and went instead for the relatively subdued luster of rose gold. It’s only recently that yellow gold has made something of a comeback. Hublot, however, has never had an issue with knowing where its customer’s head is at. As if to prove the point, the house today unveiled a collection unified by its love of the shiny stuff.

Across six watch designs, the house goes back to the original founding cocktail of yellow gold and rubber starting with the Classic Fusion Chronograph—for the first time in gold in a 42mm size. At the other end of the scale is the Big Bang Integral, whose case, bezel, and bracelet are entirely made in gold. Should that not prove baller enough, you can also have the whole thing, strap and all covered, in two all-over diamond configurations. The remaining styles include the Big Bang Unico, which features an in-house Unico movement and a case that combines brushed and polished gold as well as deep black details and a skeletonized display, and the Spirit of Big Bang in a tonneau shape with an in-house movement echoing the mixture of brushed and polished gold with a black skeletonized movement.

None of these watches are shy and retiring; neither are the prices. But Hublot’s penchant for thinking through everything to the nth degree, and creating memorable, beautifully crafted timepieces in the process, has built a strong following among the ballerati and a deal of respect from its fellow Swiss watchmakers for both its ingenuity and its finishing. One glance at the prices may tell you that you don’t have the dough to buy one, let alone all six. It might not even be your cup of tea. But you will certainly be impressed."
"From Bulgari to Zenith, These Are the Can’t-Miss Pieces from LVMH Watch Week - Robb Report","Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2x2bWgtd2F0Y2gtd2Vlay0yMDIyLWJ1bGdhcmktaHVibG90LXplbml0aC10YWctaGV1ZXItMTIzNDY1OTc1MC_SAXFodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL3dhdGNoLWNvbGxlY3Rvci9sdm1oLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstMjAyMi1idWxnYXJpLWh1YmxvdC16ZW5pdGgtdGFnLWhldWVyLTEyMzQ2NTk3NTAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is back with a bang… well, sort of.

The company had originally planned to hold the kick-off for its Q1 watches in 2022 with a big in-person unveiling in Geneva this month, which got derailed due to the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. The company had hosted its first annual Watch Week in January of 2020 with a splashy event in Dubai, just before Covid-19 went global, which gave the company a bit of an unexpected leg up over its competitors who were forced to unveil watches later in the year over a series of Zoom press conferences. But, to accommodate the change of plans this year, the company showed watches in respective markets in lieu of a global gathering. The big trends are yellow-gold cases, slim-down profiles and movements and serious dial work. Here is a look at some of the highlights.

Octo Roma Blue Carillon Tourbillon

Bulgari focused primarily on its women’s collections for its Q1 introductions (see below), but its Octo Roma Carillon got a snazzy update with the introduction of a blue high-tech carbon-based coating on the movement and the circumference of the platinum case when viewed from the side. The company also added hour indexes and an Arabic numeral at 12 o’clock. While the new hue is certainly electrifying, the numerals distract from the modern architecture of the BVL428 caliber with cut-out bridges in an ALD treatment, as well as a perforated surface made of alternating polished steel. Nevertheless, it’s a serious complication piece featuring three gongs, visible on the dial side and attached directly to the body of the case, along with three openings on the side of the case for better sound amplification. The gongs are bent and formed by hand in several stages before being hardened at temperatures up to 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit before being cleaned and reheated in a 932-degree kiln, which gives the metal its superior sound. They are draw out with a file in order to hone the chords of the chime. It plays note C for the hours; E, D and C for the quarters; and E for the minutes.

It features 75 hours of power reserve and houses 432 components in a movement measuring 25 mm by 8.25 mm. It’s a big watch, as is to be expected from this kind of timepiece, at 44 mm by 12.83 mm thick and comes with a matching blue alligator strap to highlight its new hue. Price: Upon request, limited to 30.

Serpenti Piccolissimo

WATCH

Talk about striking! Bulgari’s latest high-jewelry Serpenti Misteriosi timepieces, not surprisingly, are the most seductive women’s watches in the LVMH lineup. The Serpenti is so iconic it hardly needs an update, but this year the Italian house decided to equip the model with its other area of expertise—ultra-slim watchmaking. The new Piccolissimo (Italian for “very small”) BVL100 caliber is one of the smallest calibers in the world. The only other caliber other caliber to rival that claim is Jaeger-LeCoultre’s caliber 101, which is rectangular unlike Bulgari’s spherical creation. Bulgari’s however takes the cake for the thinnest at 2.5 mm versus JLC’s at 3.4 mm.

It’s the company’s latest twist on extreme thinness, following a series of multiple world record’s in its Octo Finissimo line for men. And while the company already laid claim to the world’s thinnest tourbillon movement in the Serpenti Seduttori, Fabrizio Buonamassa Stigliani, Bulgari’s creative director and head of watch design, says it actually takes its cues from the ultra-thin movements of the Finissimo line and zero components were used from the Seduttori tourbillon. “The idea behind this movement was to elevate the Serpenti as the best of our know-how,” he said in a small group of U.S. journalists during a press conference Monday morning. He added that the company felt obliged to create the in-house movement for its high-jewelry Serpentis because, “These kind of pieces that cost a fortune, the idea to have a quartz movement starts to become something that is not interesting for this kind of market. Even the ladies would love to have a mechanical movement for these kinds of watches.”

While the movement is certainly the biggest news for the Serpenti, there have been other refinements including more details on the interior of the mouths from gem-setting to fine-finishing, as well as a slimmer body, neck and a flatter head. In fact, Buonamassa Stigliani says that it took 6 to 8 months just to perfect the shape of the case and head between the size, weight and movement. The entire design, including the movement, was three years in the works. Meanwhile, for the first time, the tongue of the snake operates as a lever to open the head and the interior watch can fully detach from the head for easier after-sales servicing, preventing damage to the jewelry structure. The patented crown, which can be found underneath the serpent’s lower jaw, features a bidirectional system (which does not require the crown to be pulled out) that sets the time in one direction and winds the watch in the other direction.

The new series is based on heritage examples of early Serpentis, including one that belonged to Elizabeth Taylor in the early ’60s (pictured below, left). That piece was mimicked in a white gold case and head set with 626 round brilliant-cut diamonds, 2 pear-cut emeralds, a diamond-paved dial, a yellow-gold double-tour bracelet with round brilliant-cut diamonds and a white-gold tail set with round brilliant-cut diamonds, which is the most expensive of the lot at $274,000. Unlike the original, it features an immaculate invisible snow-setting of diamonds that carry through to the interior of the snake’s mouth and along the bezel of the timepiece inside.

And while you really can’t go wrong with any Serpenti, least of all one that takes after a provenance piece owned by one of the most famous jewelry collectors in Hollywood history, the rose gold case set with brilliant-cut diamonds, turquoise inserts, a 2 pear-cut rubellites for the eyes is another clear standout—so beautiful, it’s downright sinful ($251,000). Both this version and the one mentioned above also come with a faceted sapphire crystal dial cover for extra sparkle. The black ($166,000) and emerald enamel ($228,000) Serpentis are hand-engraved and feature flat, instead of faceted sapphire crystal covering the dials.

Bulgari Serpenti Misteriosi

Needless to say, these are historic pieces, thanks to the introduction of a mechanical movement and a thoughtful redesign, and will be the must-have Serpentis to own for serious collectors (with six-figure price tags to match). While they will be small in production numbers they are, however, not technically limited.

Serpenti Tubogas

The Serpenti Tubogas line went for gold this year in two single wrap Serpenti models in 18-karat yellow-gold model and two-tone steel and 18-karat yellow gold. The line had predominately focused on yellow-gold previously, although a double curved yellow-gold Tubogas did exist in the lineup and it is sold out. “Today, the yellow-gold trend is very, very strong,” said Buonamassa Stiglioni. “It’s massive. A few years ago it was just in some regions, but today we receive requests for yellow-gold from many countries.” Indeed, women have been flocking more towards yellow gold in recent years and the version above left likely won’t be available for long if the $42,000 double strap version is already out of stock.

Price: Yellow gold, $33,600; Two-tone, $13,800

HUBLOT

Big Bang Integral Time Only

The Big Bang trims its waistline. For the first time, the Big Bang Integral is being offered in a new 40 mm size. Hublot watches have, traditionally, catered to pumped-up wrists in sizes up to 45 mm. “In the ‘80s, our first watch, I believe, was 35 mm and at that time that was a men’s watch,” Hublot CEO, Ricardo Guadalupe told Robb Report. “We went to 48 mm five or six years ago and I think we are going down heavily [in size].” Previous editions of the Big Bang Integral, however, came in 42 mm but demand for more unisex-friendly watches has seen many brands begin offering models in reduced diameters. “We believe that we can sell this watch either to men or women,” Guadalupe, confirmed. “We believe that the ergonomics, the lightness and the size are quite important.” The new slim-fit look doesn’t just apply to its circumference; it is also the thinnest iteration at just 9.25-mm thick. The dial has also been scaled-back to a time-only layout versus its predecessor’s flyback chronograph movement. However, it features the same integrated bracelet as the original.

“Integral was really a big challenge, because as you know we are known for rubber straps and not bracelets,” said Guadalupe. “A year ago we launched the Big Bang Integral in 42 mm in titanium, ceramic and rose gold. Since then, we have also developed new colors of ceramic. But we wanted the Integral to be a big pillar in our collection in the future.”

Three versions of the new 40 mm Big Bang Integral are offered in an all-black ceramic, yellow-gold and titanium timepieces.

Price: All-black ceramic, $19,900, limited to 250; yellow gold, $49,400; titanium, $17,800.

Yellow Gold Collection

Reminder: Gold is back, baby! Hublot is introducing the precious metal across all of its pillar collections including the above Big Bang Integral, the Big Bang Unico, the Classic Fusion Chronograph and the Spirit of Big Bang. “I was thinking about yellow gold for a few years, because it was really in fashion in the ‘80s and ‘90s,” Guadalupe told Robb Report. “In 1980, when we came with our first Fusion [the Classic Original] watch it was in 18-karat gold with a rubber strap. So, I said to myself, ‘We should go back to those roots and come with a few models in yellow gold.'” It demonstrates a serious push for the alloy following several years of a steel rush and it’s refreshing. Guadalupe also nodded to the cyclical nature of fashion as an influence, rightly predicting the comeback of ’80s style which has already been reinvigorated on the runways.

“We will see what the market reaction will be, but sometimes it’s just a feeling and we want to be leaders of the trend that is going to happen,” he said. “Fashion always recycles and in fashion, the cycles are shorter, but in the watch industry it can be a 10- or 20-year cycle to come back to a material or another thing that has become fashionable again.” Guadalupe, however, opted for the titanium Big Bang Integral to wear on his wrist during our meeting. Nevertheless, we suspect his big bet on gold will be just in time for the next sartorial wave.

Price: Classic Fusion Chronograph ($26,800), Big Bang Integral ($52,500), Big Bang Unico ($36,700), Spirit of Big Bang ($40,500)

Zenith

Defy Skyline

Following the limited-edition release of its Revival Defy A3642 heritage piece last week, Zenith homed in on dial design for its more accessible Defy Skyline range. Drawing inspiration from the night sky above the manufacture, just like its founder, Georges-Favre Jacot, did 157 years ago, the dial features an engraved star-studded texture in a sunburst finish set within an octagonal case, inspired by the earliest Defy from 1969 on which the Revival A3642 is based, and topped off with a 12-sided bezel. Powered by the automatic El Primero 3620 movement, which takes cues from the El Primero 3600 1/10th of a second chronograph, the Defy Skyline collection features a 1/10th of a second hand, which beats at 5 HZ and comes with a stop-second mechanism for a precise setting of the time. The bi-directional rotor, visible through the caseback, has also been fashioned in a star motif and delivers 60 hours of power reserve. The steel 41 mm watches will, no doubt, draw comparisons to Audemars Piguet’s icon—the Royal Oak, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year after its debut in 1972. But at $8,400 a pop, they are far more affordable, offering a similar look at a, relatively speaking, palatable price. And as an added bonus, you can also switch out the bracelet for a rubber strap, also adorned with star pattern, which are offered in blue and black to their corresponding dial colors or olive-green for the silver-dial version. All can be easily swapped without the use of tools thanks to a quick strap-change mechanism. Price: $8,400 Defy Extreme Carbon At 45 by 15.4 mm this is the heftiest watch of Zenith’s 2022 debuts thus far. But it’s also incredibly light thanks to its layered carbon fiber case and marks the first time a Defy Extreme model has been made in the material. And, inside, it houses the fastest chronograph movement on the market with time measurements at 1/100th of a second and two escapements operating at 36,000 VpH (5Hz) for the hours and minutes and minutes at the chronograph function operating at 360,000 VpH (50 Hz). It’s a full package sports watch and the perfect mascot for the next season of Extreme E racing, of which Zenith is the official timekeeper, which will kick off this February with the Desert X Prix in Saudi Arabia. The partnership means you can expect more limited-edition Defy Extreme watches tied to the Extreme E races in the future. The watch comes on a black leather strap with a titanium triple folding clasp but can be swapped out for a black velcro version or a red rubber strap. The latter will highlight the colorful dial markers including the 1/100th of a second chronograph scale in bright yellow, the chronograph counters in bright blue, green and white and hits of red in the power reserve indicator—all of which, naturally, mimic the color schemes of the Extreme E’s “X Prix.” Fortunately, you won’t have to race to your local AD to claim your stake on one as the Defy Extreme Carbon will not be a limited edition, giving you more time to deliberate on its five-figure price tag. Price: $25,100 Tag Heuer Autavia The Autavia collecting rings in its 60th anniversary with three new models and they are fly. The main attraction of the three, if you ask us, is the all-black 42 mm Flyback Chronograph with sharply contrasting sea green Superluminova Arabic numerals and hands, however its counterpart panda dial configuration offers a more classic look where-with-everything look. The big news behind the design, though, is the new caliber, the Hueuer 02 COSC Flyback manufacture movement, which allows the wearer to reset the chronograph hand and start a new timing without needing to stop it first—ideal for lap times on a race track, a Tag Heuer specialty. Its also an important nod to late ’60s Heuer history, when the reference 1550 SG, a now collectible flyback chronograph, was created as a reliable tool watch for the German Bundeswehr Air Force. The Autavia is a big pillar for Tag Heuer. It was the first product launched under Jack Heuer, the legendary great-grandson of the founder. Its name comes from combining “automobile” and “aviation.” To that end, it was a given that a GMT should be part of the collection to represent the company’s association with the skies. But believe it or not, it is the first GMT model in the collection and houses the caliber 7 COSC GMT movement. It features a blue radiant sunray-brushed dial, a dual-color black and blue bezel and is contrasted by an orange time zone hand and Autavia logo. All three models are delivered on either a stainless steel bracelet or an alligator-leather strap with a deployant strap, althoough a third strap can be purchased should a client want to interchange the look. While the genesis of the Autavia collection had its roots in dashboard timers for cars and planes dating back to 1933, the name is now recognized as one of the brand’s most recognizable wristwatches (along with, of course, the Monaco). The all-black model is the clear standout, although owning one of the first GMTs in the Autavia collection is worthy of the vault. Tag Heuer is said to have even bigger news coming down the pipeline, so stay tuned! Price: black dial Autavia Flyback Chronograph, $6,950; silver dial Autavia Flyback Chronograph, $6,300; Autavia GMT, $4,200"

RAPAPORT... RAPAPORT...



Revenue from the segment soared to EUR 8.96 billion ($10.11 billion) as Tiffany’s sales reached “record” levels, LVMH said last week. The luxury retailer cited the success of Tiffany’s annual Blue Book collection of high-end jewelry, as well as good momentum at Bulgari and Chaumet. Sales across the category jumped 103% versus 2019.



Comparable-store sales — at locations open for at least a year — for the jewelry and watch division jumped 40%. Relative to 2019, sales climbed 7% by the same measure, the company, which acquired Tiffany in January 2021, noted.



Profit reached EUR 1.68 billion ($1.89 billion), nearly six times that of 2020. The increase was due to the addition of Tiffany as well as a low base of comparison with the previous year, when Covid-19 hampered sales. Profit also skyrocketed 128% versus 2019, LVMH added.



In the fourth quarter, revenue from jewelry and watches grew 21% year on year in organic terms to EUR 2.8 billion ($3.16 billion) and was 18% higher than in 2019.



Group revenue for 2021 rose 44% to EUR 64.22 billion ($72.45 billion), with net profit increasing 107% to EUR 17.15 billion ($19.35 billion).

LVMH acquired a minority stake in Aimè Leon Dore - nss magazine,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8yODY4Ni9sdm1oLWFpbWUtbGVvbi1kb3Jl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The LVMH group has acquired a minority stake in Aimè Leon Dore, a move that will help the New York brand expand its retail presence in the world (at the moment it owns only one boutique) and that will instead bring in the portfolio of the mega-conglomerate French a brand known for « cultural relevance, community-building know-how, elevated and refined approach to products, and sophisticated campaigns around product drops, often involving artists and musicians», to quote Miles Socha in WWD. Above all, the deal brings the almighty LVMH board into contact with Teddy Santis, who is perhaps the leading indie designer of today's streetwear, and who was able to invent an aesthetic of his own that is halfway between vintage, preppy and a very clean, classic athleisure style that today everyone associates with Aimè Leon Dore.

In addition to investing in emerging luxury brands, helping them expand production and retail footprint, LVMH has a tendency to cultivate its own talent in-house – meaning that with the acquisition of this stake it has put Santis in the position, in the future, to enter the list of star-designers of the conglomerate. The new chapter in the evolution of Aimè Leon Dore, as Santis defined it, will begin with the opening of the first European boutique in London – an important step considering how so far the brand's strategy has been to centralize sales, cutting relations with wholesalers and interacting directly with its customers. A business model that is not too alien to the streetwear world, just think of Supreme, and that instead that of luxury is exploring with caution. Acquiring shares in brands with innovative business models is another of the objectives of LVMH's financial arm, which is now in considerable expansion and has recently invested in the British start-up Heat, another young company that is revolutionizing the outlet market with its mystery boxes.

Another strong point of the brand, which has become enormously popular among fashion insiders around the world, is its ability to make every collaboration it signs go sold-out, a very important skill in a fashion world where collaborations multiply from month to month and hardly always go sold-out. The brand's collaborations with New Balance and Clarks have been among the commercial hits of recent years, while its relationship with historic brands extends far beyond the successful collaborations with Woolrich or Paraboot to Porsche and Suicoke. It is no coincidence that the brand is booming, even if in Italy it has not yet reached the popularity that it perhaps deserves. But perhaps, when his first store lands in Europe in March, things will finally start to change."
LVMH Luxury Ventures Takes a Minority Stake in Aimé Leon Dore - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LXZlbnR1cmVzLXRha2VzLWEtbWlub3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW4tYWltZS1sZW9uLWRvcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Luxury Ventures investment vehicle has taken a minority stake in budding New York-based brand Aimé Leon Dore. While the terms of the investment, which appears as though it might be the latest deal to have been brokered by Alexandre Arnault, have not been disclosed, LVMH Luxury Ventures typically targets investments ranging from €2 million to €15 million. In a statement on Tuesday, Aimé Leon Dore founder Teddy Santis stated, “LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth for Aimé Leon Dore.”

Growth for Aimé Leon Dore – which was founded in 2014 and has since made its name by way of “sneaker collaborations with New Balance and clothes and accessories inspired by New York City itself, particularly its 1990s hip-hop scene and pick-up basketball culture,” per WWD – is slated to come in the form of new brick-and-mortar outposts, with the brand reportedly planning to open a boutique in London as early as March. At the same time, the almost 8-year-old brand appears to be eyeing endeavors in the metaverse, recently filing trademark applications for registration for Aimé Leon Dore and Café Leon Dore for use in connection with virtual goods and services.

The deal between LVMH Luxury Venture and ALD is noteworthy for at least a couple of reasons: Primarily, it further points to the prowess and potential deal-making power of the younger Mr. Arnault, who is currently in the role of EVP of Product and Communications at Tiffany & Co., and who has had a hand in a number of LVMH transactions in recent years. Beyond that, LVMH’s interest in Aimé Leon Dore appears to be a nod to the influence that a number of relatively young American brands currently enjoy in the market in a way that has not been seen since maybe Ralph Lauren and co. were getting their start several decades ago.

As for LVMH’s investment arm, itself, it was rolled out by LVMH in 2017 with the aim of buying stakes in “luxury companies with sales of between 2 million and 5 million euros, and a high-growth potential.” Spearheaded by Julie Bercovy, who previously served as co-head of LVMH’s M&A department, the Luxury Ventures arm has had its focus, in large part, on the U.S. market from the outset. For instance, it entered into a “partnership” (financial details of the transaction were not disclosed) with New York-based consignment sneaker company Stadium Goods back in February 2018, ultimately off-loading its stake in the company a year later as part of a $250 million acquisition by Farfetch.

It has since taken stakes in New York-based fashion brand Gabriela Hearst, Los Angeles-based lifestyle brand Mad Happy, and New York-based watch media and e-commerce platform Hodkinee, turnkey social selling software company Replika Software, which is based between New York and Paris, and Los-Angeles-based clean skincare brand Versed."

The French luxury conglomerate reaped a net profit of €17.15 billion in 2021, driven by top brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has had an outstanding 2021 with growth exceeding expectations. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bvlgari and TAG Heuer recorded revenue of €64.2 billion last year. This represents a 44 per cent increase when compared to 2020 and up 20 per cent when benchmarked against 2021.

The company’s profit doubled year-on-year to €17.15 billion, which is a staggering 107 per cent jump compared to 2020 and a 49 per cent increase when compared to 2019. “The performance for the year confirms a return to strong growth momentum following the severe disruption to the first half of 2020 resulting from the global pandemic,” LVMH said in a statement.

Growth at the world’s largest luxury company continues to be driven by its iconic brands from the Fashion & Leather Goods business unit. It recorded organic revenue growth of 47 per cent in 2021 compared to 2020 and 42 per cent compared to 2019. Profit from recurring operations was up by 79 per cent compared to 2020 and 45 per cent compared to 2019.

Leading the charge are the brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, where the former celebrated the bicentenary of its founder’s birth. 2021 was also the year when the fashion world saw the premature departure of Virgil Abloh, Men’s Artistic Director of Louis Vuitton. The Maison paid tribute to the life and legacy of the celebrated designer with the Miami fashion show, “Virgil Was Here”.

At Dior, the momentum continues with the collections by designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones. These were presented in Athens and Paris and most had received tremendous reception. The other brands such as Celine, Loewe and Marc Jacobs, also performed outstandingly well

In the Watches & Jewellery division, the acquisition of Tiffany & Co. helped the business group to record a revenue growth of 167 per cent in 2021 compared to 2020. Last year was the first time Tiffany was consolidated within the division. The profit from recurring operations was about six times more than in 2020 and a 128 per cent increase when compared to 2019.

The company stated that Tiffany’s “record performance” was a result of its numerous impactful innovations and collaborations. The American jeweller enlisted the help of big names such as Jay-Z and Beyoncé for its “About Love” campaign and also worked with trending artists like Daniel Arsham for a limited-edition collection.

Other brands such as Bvlgari also had a great year with the launch of its High Jewellery collection Magnifica and new boutique openings. TAG Heuer had also done well with its partnership with Porsche and the release of its Super Mario smartwatch collection. For Chaumet and Zenith, both also had been highly successful with their own product releases.

“Within the context of a gradual recovery from the health crisis, LVMH is confident in its ability to maintain its current growth momentum,” the company said.

“The Group will continue to pursue a strategy focused on developing its brands building on strong innovation and investments as well as a constant quest for quality of their products, of their desirability and of their distribution.”

With this record-breaking result, LVMH is entering the new year with confidence and continues to take point in the global leadership position in the luxury world.

Big Bang Integral Time Only: the newest Hublot from LVMH Watch Week 2022 - - Deployant,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVwbG95YW50LmNvbS9iaWctYmFuZy1pbnRlZ3JhbC10aW1lLW9ubHktdGhlLW5ld2VzdC1odWJsb3QtZnJvbS1sdm1oLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstMjAyMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For LVMH Watch Week 2022, Hublot releases a set of three new time only watches in their Big Bang Integral lineup. Three novelties, three materials, three hands. One new 40mm Big Bang Integral case.

Press Release information with commentary in italics.

Commentary

The Hublot Big Bang Integral collection was first released in 2020 to a good reception from collectors, and received good medial coverage.

It was the first Big Bang’s release in 2005, that an integrated bracelet was added to the iconic Hublot collection. Hublot had chosen to launch with their in-house chronograph movement – the Unico HUB1280.

And in a move to extend the Big Bang Integral collection, Hublot’s new release is a lineup of 3 watches, all with 3 hands, and in 3 different materials – from an entry level model in titanium, a limited edition model in black ceramic, and an yellow gold version for some bling. The new watch is now a very wearable and sensible 40mm case diameter.

Titanium

Yellow Gold

All Black The Hublot Big Bang Integral Time Only Launch Collection, 2022.

The same design language and and open dial architecture is used. The case and bracelet also adopts the same design as the Unico Integrals. This is a good thing, as the fit, finish of the case and bracelet is excellent. As we noted in the review of the launch models, the Big Bang Unico is also well placed in terms of pricing, and the new Time Only models are not exceptions. For a fully integrated, in-house produced watch with 3 hands, the pricing is competitive when compared to the likes of the Chopard Alpine Eagle and the Czapek Antarctique. But lower than the asking prices for Vacheron Constantin Overseas Self Winding, Piaget Polo S, Moser Streamliner, Audemars Piguet Royal Oak.

As usual, we have requested for a hands-on session with the novelties when it arrives in Singapore, and will revert with high resolution photographs and our in-depth review when we have done so.

New: Hublot Big Bang Integral Time Only

Retail prices:

Titanium CHF 16,900 / EUR 17,500 / USD 17,800 / GBP 14,700

Yellow Gold CHF 46,900 / EUR 48,700 / USD 49,400 / GBP 40,900

All Black CHF 18,900 / EUR 19,600 / USD 19,900 / GFP 16,500

Thinner than ever, perfectly adjusted in a case of yellow gold, titanium or ‘All Black’ ceramic, it lends a refined perspective to time. This new collection, simply named ‘Time Only’, refocuses on the essence of watchmaking: hours, minutes, seconds and the date, without losing any of the power of the watchmaker’s codes. The true aesthetic signature of the Big Bang Integral, the integrated bracelet, returns to give the watch its strength.

This iconic three-link bracelet mirrors the sharp edges of the case, echoing the vibrant and powerful architecture of the middle. Each link is individually polished and satin-finished, chamfered and bevelled, providing either matt or glossy complex, alternating surfaces to reflect every spark of light. The new 40 mm case is particularly well suited to this integrated bracelet which makes each composition more profound and incisive. The new ‘Time Only’ Big Bang Integral is the epitome of Hublot, essential, intimate and powerful.

Simplicity is clearly the guiding principle when it comes to the movement: these three ‘Time Only’ versions have a sapphire crystal on the face and back, where the Big Bang’s iconic oscillating weight is housed. Here you will find the perfectly adjusted compact calibre, manufactured by the watchmaker, in its new 40mm space which it fills entirely. Each surface is satin-finished to provide a matt finish on the dial for perfect legibility. The index, hands and date window of each version are finished in yellow gold, titanium or All Black ceramic.

The ‘Time Only’ Big Bang Integral in titanium and yellow gold join the collection. The ‘All Black’ version, like all the

All Blacks crafted by the watchmaker, is limited to 250 pieces.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, Loewe, Tiffany and cosmetics retailer Sephora, reported organic revenue growth of 36% compared to 2020 and 14% compared to 2019.

The group said its Q4 sales growth accelerated, reaching £16.5 million (€20.04 billion) overall, with growth led by the French group’s biggest earners Louis Vuitton and Dior.

The luxury labels contributed to a rise in sales of LVMH’s largest division, fashion and leather goods, recording organic revenue growth of 47% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 42% compared to 2019.

The Group’s organic revenue growth of 22% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019 reflects the accelerated growth of its activities, with revenues for the business in the last three months of last year came in 51% above their 2019, pre-pandemic level.

Commenting on the results, Bernard Arnault, LVMH Chief Executive and Chairman said: ""LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis. 2021 was also a year in which LVMH was deeply moved by the tragic passing of Virgil Abloh, whose creative genius I would like to applaud.

""Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence."""

Aimé Leon Dore will continue to operate from its New York City headquarters and will remain independent from LVMH, although in the future it will build on the conglomerate's infrastructure. As part of its expansion strategy a London boutique is reportedly in the works.

Teddy Santis founded the streetwear brand in 2014 and has amassed a cult following, collaborating with brands such as Clarks, Woolrich and Porsche. After a collaboration with New Balance last year, Santis was named Creative Director of its Made In USA line, kicking off a “multi-year relationship.""

In a statement announcing the investment, Teddy Santis said: “LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth Aimé Leon Dore.”

This week marks the official beginning of a new year in watchmaking with LVMH’s Geneva Watch Week. It’s happening online, which means we can bring to you direct the brand-new launches, unveiled a few hours ago, from some of the luxury group’s storied Swiss brands.

The Autavia is a name that was in use at legendary watch brand Tag Heuer as early as 1933, when it was conceived for dashboard clocks for the blossoming sports of private aviation and motor-racing. It was only in 1962, however, that the name began top grace the dials of a new line of sporty wristwatches for an entirely new generation of petrol-heads.

Jack Heuer’s first new watch since he took the reins of the Heuer brand in 1958 was a hand-wound chronograph with a black dial and white sub-dials, a style known to watch nerds as a reverse panda. Technical, yet easy to read, it defined the accessible new mood of the early '60s and was quickly adopted as much as a style statement as a functional tool. It predated another famous Heuer, the Carrera, by a single year. For an indication of hipness, Mick Jagger owned one of each.

This week Heuer launches three new models of the Autavia in a 60th anniversary homage to the original with some serious upgrades under the hood. Two chronographs, one with an all black dial but with a blackened steel case, and another in steel with a steel dial and black sub dials—effectively a panda—feature a new in-house, COSC-certified Heuer Calibre 02 chronograph movement.

That would be innovation enough for many, but this movement also introduces a flyback function to the Autavia for the first time. The flyback is conceived to allow a user to restart the chronograph function instantaneously with the single press of a pusher without having to stop and restart it, allowing, for example, consecutive lap times to be recorded with ease. Both chronographs come with black alligator straps, with the DLC coated black version—for our money—being the most striking.

The third 60th anniversary Autavia is a major departure for the Autavia family. It features another in-house movement, the COSC-certified Heuer Caliber 07, and it’s a GMT watch, the first time that functionality has appears in the Autavia. Without the classic chronograph sub dials it looks markedly different from the other versions, with a simpler, open dial in blue that features a second time zone indicated by an orange pointer."

Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted record revenue of €64.2 billion in 2021, a leap of +44% year-on-year and up +20% compared to 2019.

Organic revenue growth climbed by +36% compared to 2020 and rose +14% compared to 2019. The performance for the year, said the company, “confirms a return to strong growth momentum following the severe disruption to the first half of 2020 resulting from the global pandemic”.

Profit from recurring operations stood at €17,151 million for 2021, more than double 2020 levels, and up +49% compared to 2019. Operating margin reached 26.7%, up 8 points compared to 2020 and 5 points compared to 2019.

Group share of net profit amounted to €12,036 million, up +156% compared to 2020 and +68% compared to 2019. Operating free cash flow, which exceeded €13 billion, was more than twice that of both 2020 and 2019.

In Selective Retailing, DFS continues to be affected by the limited recovery in international travel, noted the group. Organic revenue was up +18% in the division compared to 2020 and down -18% compared to 2019 “due to the impact of travel retail” though profit from recurring operations was back in positive territory in 2021.

LVMH stated: “The health crisis continued to weigh on the activities of DFS due to the persistent weakness in the numbers of travellers. The T Gallerias in Macau nevertheless performed well thanks to growing demand from local customers and DFS launched operations in Hainan. La Samaritaine, which reopened in Paris in June after an ambitious renovation, saw an encouraging level of customer traffic.”

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +26% in 2021 compared to 2020 and +9% compared to 2019. Profit from recurring operations was up +34% compared to 2020.

Champagne volumes were up compared to 2019. Growth was particularly strong in the US and Europe, which benefited from the reopening of restaurants and the gradual recovery in regional tourism. The year marked the integration, from the third quarter onwards, of the Champagne house Armand de Brignac, in which LVMH holds a 50% stake. Hennessy Cognac performed well with an increase in volumes compared to 2019, despite supply constraints. China and the US experienced a strong rebound.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of +47% in 2021 compared to 2020 and +42% compared to 2019. With organic revenue growth of +51% compared to 2019, the fourth quarter showed a sharp rise compared to previous quarters. Profit from recurring operations was up +79% compared to 2020 and +75% compared to 2019.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of +27% in 2021 compared to 2020. Organic revenue was stable compared to 2019. Profit from recurring operations was nearly nine times higher than 2020 and returned to 2019 levels.

LVMH noted: “In an environment marked by a limited recovery in international travel and the closure of many points of sale over a period of several months, LVMH’s major brands chose to maintain a policy of selective distribution, limiting promotions and growing online sales on their own website.”

Christian Dior benefited from the growth of of Miss Dior and Sauvage. The latter became the highest selling fragrance in the world (women’s and men’s lines included) which is a worldwide first for a male fragrance. Guerlain recorded “excellent performance”, driven by its Abeille Royale and Orchidée Impériale skincare lines.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of +167% in 2021 compared to 2020 thanks to Tiffany, consolidated for the first time. Profit from recurring operations was almost six times higher than in 2020 and up +128% compared to 2019.

La Samaritaine

LVMH has deployed some of its most prominent luxury brands to create a world class spa, beauty and wellness offering at La Samaritaine in Paris, as Karen Maxwell reports





Located in the heart of the French capital, the newly renovated La Samaritaine department store was reopened recently by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron – a testament to the significance of this iconic landmark building on the banks of the Seine. Now owned by luxury goods conglomerate LVMH – the company behind of a vast portfolio of brands from Chanel and Dior to Louis Vuitton and Moët – La Samaritaine has been extended to create 70,000sq m of floor space with the building of a vast glass-walled addition by edgy Japanese architectural firm Sanaa. The original building has also been sympathetically restored to highlight its Art Nouveau features, which include a magnificent staircase and atrium, peacock frescoes and enamelled lava panels on the façade. Sanaa were also responsible for the installation of a statement glass roof with Eiffel-style iron frame which oversails 20,000sq m of luxury retail space, 12 gastronomic ‘concepts’, 15,000sq m of offices and what is reportedly Europe’s largest beauty retail floor, which covers the entirety of the building’s 3,400sq m footprint. The pièce de resistance, however, is a 72-room hotel – Cheval Blanc Paris – which comes complete with luxury Dior Spa, fusing multiple LVMH brands in a single development. This is Cheval Blanc’s first urban location and follows on from openings in Courchevel, St Barts and The Maldives. Further properties are planned for Beverly Hills and London as LVMH takes Cheval Blanc into more urban locations. Huge investment

LVMH poured nearly €500m (US$587.5m, £425.6m) into the project during the building’s controversial 15-year overhaul, with the entire site now being managed by LVMH subsidiary, DFS Group. La Samaritaine had been a staple of the Parisien retail scene since its opening in 1869, serving the mid-market until its closure in 2005. Its reinvention as an icon of luxury, designed mainly for the super rich has angered some local people, with black paint being sprayed onto the building’s facade during its opening weeks during protests about wealth inequality. Reports from Paris indicate that the store is quieter than expected – partly due to the absence of wealthy travellers to the French capital and partly due to pandemic pressures. However, LVMH is taking a long-term view of the investment, so this is not thought to be of immediate concern – especially as the luxury market appears to be riding out the pandemic better than many other sectors. Spa Cinq Mondes à la Samaritaine

LVMH also reached outside its own brand portfolio in creating the spa and wellness offering at La Samaritaine, issuing a tender for the creation of a second spa on the beauty retail floor which was won by French brand Cinq Mondes. Founded in 2001 by Jean-Louis Poiroux and Nathalie Bouchon-Poiroux, Cinq Mondes now trades in 35 countries, with the new Spa Cinq Mondes à la Samaritaine being the brand’s second location in Paris. The design is by Suprem Architectures, with each of the seven treatment rooms – including one for couples – having a backlit feature wall reminiscent of Art Deco stained glass. Poiroux told Spa Business all facilities – including the hammam, double exfoliation room and private relaxation areas – have been conceived to create an immersive healing journey in the heart of Paris. Spa rituals including massages, scrubs, wraps, facials and hammam treatments draw on global healing practices from Japan, India and China, while an exclusive treatment called The Great Ritual from Okinawa lasts 50 minutes and includes a traditional Japanese kobido facial and amma back massage, costing €124 (US$147, £106). The new spa also has a 100sq m boutique showcasing Cinq Mondes beauty rituals and skincare range. The Dior spa

This is Dior’s first standalone spa opening for nearly 10 years and is thought to signal a renewed interest in the spa and wellness sector by the brand. The entire spa pays tribute to the life and work of celebrated couturier Christian Dior, with the layout – from the curved marble staircase to an evocative Parisian ‘salon’ – celebrating landmark moments in the history of the brand. An interactive mirror above a cosy fireplace screens the latest fashion shows, while the spa boutique offers exclusive Dior/Cheval Blanc product collections. The six treatment suites have private white onyx bathrooms and opulent finishes. Among these the rose and gold-decorated Bonheur suite features two massage beds that rise from the floor during treatment for a weightless experience for two; the avant-garde New Look suite has been designed specially for the six-hand Couture Dream massage; and the Sauvage suite – with its alpha quartz massage bed – evokes a natural environment. The standout feature is its 30m swimming pool – reportedly the longest hotel pool in Paris – which is finished with waves of hand-made mosaics by artist Michael Mayer and is overlooked by secluded rest areas with oversized loungers. The opulent ambience is down to design by architect Peter Marino, who previously worked for LVMH on Louis Vuitton stores in Los Angeles and London, Chanel stores in New York, Seoul, Namiki Ginza and Istanbul and a Dior flagship in Seoul – as well as being on the team for the upcoming Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills. The spa’s gym, with kit by Technogym, Peloton and Rogue, has a private personal training studio where training sessions can be viewed on a big screen. The gym is available to hotel guests and a limited number of members, who pay a rumoured €9,000 a year for use of the select facility. The mix is completed by a Rossano Ferretti hair salon located close to the Dior Spa reception where the stylists are personally mentored by the Italian hair icon. The treatments

Dior’s beauty ambassadors combine techniques such as Dior Tissue Massage and Sensorial Awakening with technology to provide bespoke experiences for guests. Three classic treatments are inspired by Dior’s Prestige and L’Or de Vie skincare lines which harness the power of the Rose de Granville – a flower which is hand-picked twice a year for its regenerative properties – and extracts of the Yquem grapevine from Bordeaux vineyard, Château d’Yquem, which is also owned by LVMH. A Sapphire Crystal Micro-Abrasion treatment uses Dior technology for a programme of customised and booster treatments.

The customer service was exemplary, as you would expect with Dior. I was greeted by spa director Sophie Levy Kraeme who – like the other staff members – was impeccably styled in her Dior uniform. She’s considered to be a French spa expert and certainly understands how to deliver a luxurious experience, having previously worked at Cheval Blanc Courchevel. Sophie led me through reception to a comfortable armchair in the opulent beige and rose ‘Parisian’ salon and I was taken through an iPad-accessed diagnostic questionnaire which included simple, uncomplicated questions about my age, health and areas I wanted the therapist to focus on during my treatment. Treatments I had an extensive list of no less than 48 enticing treatments to choose from, which had been carefully curated by Sophie and her team, and decided on the one-and-a-half-hour Precious Energy signature treatment which I was told has been designed to ‘promote positive energy and inner wellbeing’. My Dior ambassador guided me to the Bonne Etoile suite. She was extremely professional and explained the preparation etiquette and checked the room temperature and my music preference before leaving me to undress. The bed linen was embroidered with a classic Dior quote: ‘Deep in every heart slumbers a dream’ – very apt for this luxurious experience and as I lay on the treatment bed, the ceiling lit up to reveal Christian Dior’s ‘lucky star’, showing my personal horoscope in lights – a unique feature within this particular suite. My ambassador seemed exceptionally well trained and showed a natural aptitude for customer care. She examined my face and suggested a deep cleanse before my chosen treatment. This involved the energising use of semi-precious stones – rock crystal, yellow quartz, labradorite and agate and a slow back, arms and stomach massage, followed by a relaxing facial. This started with a traditional thermo-heating mask and followed by a facial massage using dermatologically-tested, high-performance professional products and my personally-chosen fragrances from Dior’s ‘garden of flowers’. I’ve had many massage and facial treatments over the years and this was one of the best I’ve ever had She explained the treatment process, the stones’ effects and the product benefits and regularly checked my comfort throughout. Her expertise regarding treatment protocol, technique and product knowledge was exceptional and I have to say I felt fantastic afterwards. My skin felt light, bright and revived and the Dior floral-fragranced products, which is unusual given the prevalence of unscented products these days, were delightful. Afterwards, she left me to get dressed and handed me over to a colleague who offered water and a selection of teas and escorted me back to reception – through the boutique – where I enjoyed looking through the range of Bains de Dior purifying mists and Solutions Professionelles – which included active formulae exclusively designed for Dior Spa. The verdict In my opinion, the whole experience was superb. Each treatment has been very well designed and presented within the brochure – although the treatments are expensive by Parisian standards – my treatment cost €350 Euros for the hour and a half, while an average range for the city is €150-180. However, I’ve had many massage and facial treatments over the years and this was one of the best I’ve ever had right across the board – spa ambience, therapist expertise and attention to detail, plus the quality of the products and my post-treatment feeling of wellbeing throughout my body. I left Dior Spa Cheval Blanc Paris with a big smile on my face!

LVMH Watch Week 2022: The 6 watches we have our eyes on - Lifestyle Asia Bangkok,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2JrL3N0eWxlL3dhdGNoZXMvbHZtaC13YXRjaC13ZWVrLTIwMjItaHVibG90LWJ2bGdhcmktemVuaXRoLXRhZy1oZXVlci_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5saWZlc3R5bGVhc2lhLmNvbS9iay9zdHlsZS93YXRjaGVzL2x2bWgtd2F0Y2gtd2Vlay0yMDIyLWh1YmxvdC1idmxnYXJpLXplbml0aC10YWctaGV1ZXIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Watch Week 2022 ends today. Here are the highlight pieces we’re still thinking about, whether it’s Bulgari’s emerald-enriched Octo Roma or Hublot’s Sang Bleu II Magic Gold.

The Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton or LVMH Watch Week 2022, in usual fashion, is the first global gathering of the horlogerie calendar. Also, in usual fashion, it’s an absolute fiesta of mechanical mastery, micro-engineering, artistic wrist-ice, and some seriously retro stuff. Surfing through this year’s novelties from Zenith, TAG Heuer, Bvlgari and Hublot, I found a mutual emotion – they’re all celebrating their past while also creating icons for the future, charting new territories for the watch world. These are six of our favourite timepieces from this year’s LVMH watch fair.

LVMH Watch Week 2022: Our favourite timepieces

Zenith DEFY Revival A3642

If you’re looking for a dose of funk and disco in this year’s LVMH line-up, this is it.

Zenith cracked open a vault from the 1960s (the pre-‘luxury sports watches’ era) and pulled out something truly special – The design folder for the original 1969 DEFY, which, right since its debut, has been a hot commodity in the everyday-worn luxe sports watch market. The new ‘Revival’ edit celebrates this success, as it’s a true heritage hot-ticket for fans. For 2022, Zenith retains everything retro about the watch and packs an automatic calibre Elite 670 under the hood. The gradient brown dial comes cased in stainless steel. Limited to 250 pieces.

Bvlgari Octo Roma Grande Sonnerie

In the watchmaking industry, Bvlgari has always served as a vantage point for all things micro-engineered and the ‘haute-est’ enrichment in modern joaillerie. This, of course, is prominently underlined with Roman elegance. With the Octo Finissimo, their mastery has proven time and time again, that the most notorious of watch complications like minute repeaters, perpetual calendars, and tourbillons can fit in cases thinner than four millimeters. On the other hand, we’re forgetting that Bvlgari are ‘Jewelers of Time’ and have a bedazzling heritage in artistic jewelry.

At the LVMH Watch Week 2022, we saw an Octo Roma that celebrates both emotions. Right from case to crown and lugs to bezel, the new Bvlgari Octo Roma Grand Sonnerie appears to be a chandelier for the wrist – Decorated with a total of 446 baguette-cut Zambian emeralds and diamonds racking in over 30 carats. Inside, rests a self-winding BVL703 calibre that boasts up to 8 complications. With four hammers and gongs of the grand sonnerie, we also see a power-reserve indicator. To complement the emeralds, the timepiece is also strapped with green alligator leather.

Bvlgari Lvcea Intarsio

For Bvlgari, the Lvcea is a round-dialed canvas that has always housed the timeless elegance and marvels of Rome. In its 2022 iteration, Bvlgari takes the sundials of ancient Rome that captured light to signal the passage of time, into a three-dimensional form. Using a marquetry technique called Intarsio, the dial consists of 37 hand-cut blue aventurine micro-elements, this allows a highly unique display of lightwork and reflection that creates the three-dimensional effect. To complement this, the 33-mm steel case houses a diamond-set bezel and a cabochon-cut rubellite crown. You also have 11 diamonds as hour markers. You also see a date window at three o’clock. Inside, rests a self-winding calibre B77 with a 42-hour power reserve.

TAG Heuer Autavia Chronometer Flyback Chronograph

The Autavia quite rightfully so, is the chronograph watch, and this year. it’s celebrating its 60th anniversary. This silent chronograph veteran was a real hit back in the 1960s, where watching car races was a Sunday morning staple. Bringing back the heat once again, the Autavia comes forth loaded with a flyback chronograph, a first for the line. You get to choose between dial options of panda, all-black, or blue (GMT). All pieces feature Super-LumiNova indexes and hands. Inside, we see a Calibre Autavia Chronometer Flyback Chronograph or Calibre Heuer 02 COSC Flyback, which boasts an 80-hour power reserve and winds automatic.

Zenith Defy Skyline

Presenting the new Defy Skyline, dedicated to ‘those who follow their light and forge their own path on their journey towards their star’, as Zenith says. The dial boasts a set of geometrically-placed astronomical-inspired motifs, or well, a grid of Zenith stars. The three-hand watch is cased in 41-mm stainless steel with a blue-toned sunburst-patterned dial. The hands and indexes are rhodium-plated and coated with SuperLuminova. It’s powered by an automatic-running El Primero 3620 that promises a power reserve of 60 hours. You also get a tiny date window at three o’clock. You also get to choose between dial options of silver and black.

Hublot Big Bang Sang Bleu II Magic Gold

Seven years running, Hublot refreshes its iconic partnership with Sang Bleu with a super-special case ingredient they call ‘Magic Gold’. What’s Magic Gold? it’s an in-house material cooked up by Hublot where they mix 18-karat gold with ceramic. This way, they almost completely rid the worries of scratches and disfiguration. With a Magic Gold case, the dial, in usual Sang Bleu fashion, retains its intricate, geometric, and symmetric suave. Powering this marvel is a calibre HUB 1240 Unico Chronograph, that runs automatically with a 72-hour power reserve. All of this is strapped in rubber and a special Sang Bleu clasp. Bonus: There’s also a flyback chronograph on board. Definitely a highlight from the LVMH Watch Week 2022.

Dissecting Luxury's Love for Streetwear | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2Rpc3NlY3RpbmctbHV4dXJ5cy1sb3ZlLWZvci1zdHJlZXR3ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, Virgil Abloh’s last show for Louis Vuitton, staged posthumously in Paris, raised questions on how to manage the legacy of a multi-tasking creative genius who brought streetwear to the highest levels of the luxury market and became the only Black designer to not only helm a luxury mega-label but take on a wider role at a major luxury group.

Vuitton chief executive Michael Burke has said the company isn’t in a rush to name a successor, but tapping a designer who can extend the brand’s successful foray into streetwear, increasingly central to the luxury business model, is likely to be a key consideration.

Signs of streetwear’s growing importance to the luxury sector were everywhere this week, not just at the Vuitton show. On Tuesday, as invitations arrived for Japanese streetwear guru Nigo’s debut show for Kenzo, LVMH Luxury Ventures said it had taken a minority stake in New York-based streetwear label Aimé Leon Dore. The same day, Swiss brand Bally named Rhuigi Villaseñor, the founder of Los Angeles-based streetwear brand Rhude, its new creative director.

It’s no secret that streetwear has become a critical part of luxury’s business model, helping to drive blockbuster results in recent years for major brands like Gucci, Dior and Balenciaga.

At the heart of the shift is a new generation of consumers, who grew up with hip-hop, skateboarding and basketball, and have long mixed their Supreme with their Dries Van Noten.

Generations Y and Z are already the main growth engine of the luxury market. By 2025, they are expected to account for 45 percent of total luxury spending. But this underestimates their influence. A “Millennial mindset” has rapidly taken hold in the luxury market, transforming consumer preferences across all generations.

“A style that was rebellious 20 years ago has become totally mainstream now. It isn’t Larry Clark’s ‘Kids’ anymore,” said Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi. “That means brands have to rethink their business model.”

On the back of this shift, streetwear has become a key driver of luxury sales growth. In particular, the category has helped to restore luxury’s appeal with men amid declining demand for suiting, watches and formal shoes. And whereas ready-to-wear for both men and women was once largely focused on complex tailoring, office attire and eveningwear — making it far less profitable than the industry’s “golden-goose” handbags with their high margins and attractive retail economics — the new lexicon of logo tees and hoodies has been highly lucrative.

Streetwear has also brought the luxury industry compelling new sales and marketing strategies, from product “drops” that generate buzz and are more in sync with consumer expectations for newness at the speed of social media to new community-building efforts that tap into eagerness, not just for cool-looking clothes, but something to believe in and belong to. Brands have discovered that when the engaged communities built by streetwear designers collide with the clout of a luxury logo, they can sell status hoodies for the price of a suit.

Importantly, the streetwear ethos has also helped to revamp the very meaning of a luxury logo, the sector’s most powerful commercial tool. Whereas monograms had fallen out of favour for many clients in mature markets like the US and Japan, streetwear designers turned logos into expressions of tribal identity, not just markers of affluence. And while exclusivity remains critical to the luxury equation, reframing logos as badges of belonging to the communities fostered by figures like Virgil Abloh has chimed with a growing focus on inclusivity.

In the US market, where a reckoning with racial inequality has rocked society, harnessing creators anchored in America’s urban culture over designers with a penchant for ivory towers has also helped to combat the perception that luxury brands are not only exclusive but exclusionary.

Ultimately, streetwear may one day become as significant an addition to luxury’s business model as a category like beauty, which also came with millions of new consumers, new marketing and distribution strategies, and highly favourable economics.

"Zenith Defy Skyline Watch Review, Price, and Where to Buy - LVMH Watch Week 2022 - Esquire","Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL3N0eWxlL21lbnMtYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvYTM4ODY3ODg4L3plbml0aC1kZWZ5LXNreWxpbmUtd2F0Y2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Welcome to Dialed In, Esquire's weekly column bringing you horological happenings and the most essential news from the watch world since March 2020. This week marks the official beginning of a new year in watchmaking with LVMH’s Geneva Watch Week. It’s happening online, which means we can bring to you direct the brand-new launches, unveiled a few hours ago, from some of the luxury group’s storied Swiss brands.

While the Defy family of watches from Zenith has produced some mind-bending experimental—and expensive—watches in the past two years, including a Double Tourbillon whose transparent case is made entirely of sapphire crystal, the brand is also mindful of making its recognizable angular aesthetic available at more accessible prices and in simpler forms. The Defy Skyline, officially released this morning in Geneva, is a stripped-down yet luxurious daily beater. At once contemporary and timeless, it derives its good looks from the rugged Defy line first launched in 1969.

Zenith Defy Revival A3642 Zenith Defy Revival A3642 $7,200 at zenith-watches.com

For die-hard vintage fans, a nut-and-bolt replica of the original—the Defy Revival A3642—was launched in a limited run of 250 pieces just last week. It oozes sporty, late-'60s style. It comes in the original size of 37mm and takes almost all its design cues from the original factory drawings of the 1969 Defy, down to the smoky gray gradient dial and the original multifaceted octagonal steel case with a 14-sided fixed bezel.

The new Skyline is an enlarged modern update (at 41mm) that distills much of the vibe of the original and comes with three metallic dial options in black, blue, and silver and a simplified case shape with a 12-sided bezel. A four-pointed star pattern is engraved into the dials echoing the old star that used to decorate the solid case backs. The new version has a sapphire crystal case back to show off the movement.

Zenith Defy Skyline Zenith Defy Skyline €9,200 at zenith-watches.com

But the most unmissable thing about the Defy Skyline, when you get up close, is its seconds counter at 9 o’clock. In fact, it’s not a seconds counter at all. Driven by the El Primero 3620—an adaptation of the 3600 movement used in the super-technical Zenith Chronomaster—the hand counts tenths of a second, which means it makes a full revolution in just 10 seconds instead of the usual 60. Despite the power needed to keep it going constantly, the automatic movement has an impressive power reserve of 60 hours. It’s a function that is conceived to be playful in this application rather than functional—you could certainly waste mesmerizing minutes just watching it whip around its tiny sub-dial or showing it off to others—but it derives from the serious functionality engineered for its more purpose-built cousin, the Chronomaster."
"Aimé Leon Dore Keeps Winning, With Investment From LVMH - Boss Hunting","Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9odXN0bGUvZGVhbHMvYWltZS1sZW9uLWRvcmUtbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aimé Leon Dore has gone from strength to strength in the last year or so, with collaborations coming thick and fast with brands such as New Balance, Porsche, and Clarks just to name a few. All the hard work from founder Teddy Santis and his team, however, appears to have finally paid off, with the overnight announcement of some investment from the LVMH group.

LVMH Luxury Ventures is the investment arm of the luxury conglomerate, tasked with the enviable job of finding exciting up-and-coming brands to offer their backing. Within their portfolio are the likes of HODINKEE, Mystery Box, and Gabriela Hearst – meaning ALD is in extremely good company.

RELATED: Aimé Leon Dore’s Teddy Santis Named Creative Director Of New Balance

While the specific terms of the investment haven’t been made public just yet, LVMH Luxury Ventures typically offers €2 million to €15 million (AU$3.1 million – AU$23.6 million) in funding for between a 5% and a 25% stake in the business. According to one report, the investment may be funnelled towards the opening of an Aimé Leon Dore boutique in London, but the brand will also benefit ongoing from the “support and guidance” from the expansive and resource-rich LVMH network.

While taking funding from investors can spell the end of creative independence for some clothing labels, ALD will remain independent in the running of its operations, which are based in New York City. Aimé Leon Dore was founded in Queens back in 2014, and immediately made waves with its style that blended preppy looks with street style.

At the beginning of 2021, founder Teddy Santis was named as the creative director of New Balance “Made in USA”, in an appointment that has proven wildly successful, including the launch of the fresh silhouette called the New Balance 550. Considering what Aimé Leon Dore has shown themselves capable of without the backing of LVMH, we’re collectively excited to see what is in store with the backing of the group secured."
"John Gerhardt, Creative Director for Moët Hennessy reflects on brand identity, sustainability, and creativity - McGill University","Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2dpbGwuY2EvZGVzYXV0ZWxzL2FydGljbGUvbW1yLXByb2dyYW0vam9obi1nZXJoYXJkdC1jcmVhdGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1tb2V0LWhlbm5lc3N5LXJlZmxlY3RzLWJyYW5kLWlkZW50aXR5LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWFuZC1jcmVhdGl2aXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is synonymous with luxury, excellence, innovation, and creativity and its longstanding global success can be attributed to the great minds behind the brands who work every day to innovate the retail experience and create luxury goods. John Gerhardt is a retailing visionary who has navigated the luxury industry for the last 25 years by holding positions at some of the largest and most renowned North American and Global luxury retailers. The Bensadoun School of Retail Management hosted Gerhart as a guest speaker for a Retail Leaders talk event where he provided valuable insights into career navigation and his current position as Creative Director for Moët Hennessy.

Gerhardt debuted his career in the retail industry, working at Parachute, one of the first Canadian brands to move to SOHO, New York. In this role, he learned how to manage a team by giving ""clear direction [...] not just about supporting [his] staff, but about empowering them [...], motivate people [...] and inspiring people"".

When asked about key responsibilities in his career journey, he again highlights that inspiring others is crucial. This position is what propelled and supported his career in retailing. He then held a position at Holt Renfrew as a Creative Director and DFS/T Galleria (LVMH) in Hong Kong and New York as a Senior Vice President in Branding and Creative. Within the latter role, he internalized the creative, which he now leverages within his current role as the Branding and Creative Director of Moët Hennessy (LVMH) in Paris.

To Gerhardt, being a creative director does not only mean being creative but knowing how to sell and having key presentations skills while inspiring others. By centralizing functions in his line of work, he rebranded five Maisons, leading to cost and production efficiencies.

Moët Hennessy is an ""umbrella of 27 brands"" in which each is marketed uniquely. Branding identity is a significant aspect of John Gerhardt's work, and he outlines three key elements that Moët Hennessy focuses on. The first focus is helping ""the smaller brands and work on their brand identity"" to ""redesign them, reskin them, or reimage them."" The second is content-focused, to support the brands, and the last dives into leveraging photography and video to produce the primary functions.

One example he mentioned with respect to brand identity is how he and his team were successful in elevating the Chandon brand by changing the packaging and creating an inclusive and diverse brand image, utilizing their uniqueness of being the only global Maison that has wineries across various continents. Each brand has a different audience, allowing Moët Hennessy to keep them separate to avoid cannibalization.

""We make certain that there is no crossover. That they are as distinct as possible, and we look at value propositions and how they all have different value propositions. We look at different [corporate social responsibility] programs and how they all have different CSR investments. We look at brand codes and visual codes to make certain they are not playing in the same arena, and whether it is as simple as color or whether it is as big as values, they all have to be different,"" says Gerhardt.

When discussing branding, Gerhardt explains the importance of sustainability at Moët Hennessy who “look[s] at it from things as tactical as packaging and labeling to things as strategic as biodynamic vineyards.” Sustainability is a priority for LVMH and all the brands under it.

Creativity is another crucial part of the Moët Hennessy brand. However, creativity and business are often seen as separate. Many believe business is about generating profit, while creativity is about artistic imagination. For Gerhardt, creativity is a vital business skill that ensures differentiation and successful product development and marketing. He shares insights on managing creativity and explains how 'businesspeople' should embrace creativity.

""I would advise businesspeople not to be so subjective when it comes to creativity and to separate themselves from their ingrained aesthetic or feelings about whether you like it or whether you don't. It needs to come back to the consumer [...], the trend, and whether it is on-brand or not. There are many things I do that I don't like [...], but it's what makes sense to the market and the brand. The biggest advice I can give to businesspeople working with creatives is to [...] separate your personal bias from what is best to the brand.""

As a pioneer of retail and creative direction, Gerhardt left the Master of Management in Retailing (MMR) 2022 cohort with valuable career advice. He attributes risk-taking to his success and emphasizes the importance of developing a niche.

""You can't be risk-averse and be really successful. You have to take risks. Sometimes the risks will pay off, and sometimes they won't, but you have to take them. [...] You have to be vulnerable, put yourself out there, and try new things all the time. I separated myself during my freelance career; when everyone was going left, I went right. And it paid off because I was able to renegotiate my rates [...] they paid for that uniqueness. If I were to look into a crystal ball, I think we will walk away from generalists in retail and people who try to be everything to everybody. You need to be specialized in the way yo develop your career, be as niche as you can and develop your own point of view. The 27 unique brands we have within Moet Hennessy are only there because they are different.""

This opportunity to speak to Gerhardt was enlightening as we learned about the drive, passion, and commitment it takes to work in the luxury sector. By learning more about brand identity, sustainability, and creativity, the MMR students got a 360 view of the inner workings of Moët Hennessy and earned valuable career advice from an inspiring retail pioneer.
