The Jardin d’Acclimatation has been managed by LVMH since 1984, and a recent partnership with Compagnie des Alpes, a company that develops theme parks and ski resorts, means that work on the new project will start soon, with the theme park scheduled to open in May 2018.

The theme park itself will feature 17 new attractions, some of which will be Steampunk themed. LVMH aims for the park to get 3 million visitors a year by 2025, which would make the Jardin d’Acclimatation the second most visited attraction in France, falling just behind Disneyland Paris.

It’s been a busy few months for LVMH, with the luxury fashion and lifestyle group announcing the expansion of its Métiers d’Excellence in Italy, as well as increasing its profits, partly because of the Louis Vuitton x Supreme collaboration.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",neutral,0.9999932050704956,0
This Incredible New Tequila Was Inspired by a Mexican Volcano - Maxim,"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1heGltLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2x2bWgtdm9sY2FuLXRlcXVpbGEtMjAxNy04L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This Incredible New Tequila Was Inspired by a Mexican Volcano

Here’s why Volcan is one of the very best tequilas you can buy…

In the Middle Paleolithic Period, a massive volcano erupted in what is now Jalisco, Mexico. Two hundred thousand years later, it’s about to change the way you drink.

The epic explosion ultimately paved the way for the launch of Volcan De Mi Tierra, a new super-premium tequila brand from LVMH, the French luxury goods partnership, by creating the mineral-rich soil that surrounds the volcano.

It just happened to be ideal for growing two distinct types of Weber blue agave, the essential base of the very best tequila, and is the reason the company chose this spot in which to create its first original spirit since LVMH was founded 30 years ago.

It’s a fitting anniversary gift for the iconic company whose initials stand for Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, combining three of the world’s most famous luxury brands. While many of the components of its spirits portfolio (see “Blithe Spirits,” next page) predate the company’s existence, the fact that LVMH, controlled by billionaire Bernard Arnault, a man of impeccable taste, chose tequila for its first original launch says much about the storied spirit’s evolution.

Of course, to “land of my volcano,” has some impressive heritage to build on, in the way of all LVMH pedigreed holdings. That’s thanks to a partnership with Mexico’s Gallardo family, long-standing landowners in the shadow of the inactive but still imposing volcano, aptly named Tequila.

Volcan De Mi Tierra encompasses

both the fields surrounding the Gallar

dos’ beautifully restored hacienda and a

revamped historic distillery nearby

using time-honored methods of small-

batch production.

The unique landscape offers the ability to grow agave in

both the lowlands at the volcano’s base and the highlands nearer its summit, creating a distinctive spirit that truly expresses terroir, the winemaking term meaning a sense of place. Blending both agave types, which is unusual for a luxury tequila, allows Volcan to “embrace the nuances” of each to create a truly unique style of tequila, notes Anna María Romero Mena, Volcan’s expert maestra de tequila. Lowlands agave is said to give an austere and herbaceous flavor profile while the highland plants proffer the typically preferred citrus and oral notes; Romero Mena considers a blend of both to be essential.

The brand has initially launched two expressions, Blanco and Cristalino, bearing the Volcan De Mi Tierra label. Most consumers will be familiar with blanco, or silver, tequila, which owes its transparency to little or no aging. Cristalino is the result of a newer method in which the color is extracted from aged anejo spirit.

While luxury tequila in itself is not a new concept, LVMH is bringing a bonafide level of expertise to the category, in addition to the innovative recipe, and putting the popular spirit on a par with its other legendary brands. Volcan De Mi Tierra’s dapper president and CEO, Trent Fraser, was formerly the vice president of the most prestigious among them, Dom Pérignon. And so it would not be far off to say that Volcan is poised to become the Champagne of tequilas.

“This is an incredibly exciting time for [LVMH], as we are embarking on something truly unique, designed to really break the mold,” Fraser tells Maxim. “This is a small and entrepreneurial project that has been secretly in the works for over three years. The anticipation and excitement internally is phenomenal.” As for how he might implement skills learned at Dom Pérignon in tequila country, he says: “Strategically our approach will have similarities, as we will be very targeted with the utmost precision in all that we do. We are very considered in our approach and almost surgical in how we go to market.” That means only select retailers, restaurants, and bars who “respect” the spirit will be able to stock it, for one thing.

Why did LVMH launch a tequila brand instead of something with more obvious appeal to the company’s affluent customer base? “Knowledge and education have transformed the tequila category in recent times,” Fraser says. “Many of the older memories and maybe not-so-positive experiences of people going through college 20 years ago are being replaced with more fun, elegant, and appreciative moments. Consumers are now understanding what tequila actually can be capable of, and hopefully

Volcan will further elevate this.”

To be sure, Volcan De Mi Tierra is as carefully crafted as any fabled elixir in LVMH’s portfolio. During the three-plus years of development, much experimentation was carried out with yeast variations, agave selection and blending, and maturation in multiple casks. Romero Mena ultimately settled on barrels that formerly held old-world spirits.

“It was my hope to create a spirit that is truly committed to expressing the heart of the agave and terroir from which it came,” Romero Mena says. The result, she notes, is “authentically complex yet elegant and balanced.” The Blanco is made to be enjoyed mixed into cocktails, while

the Cristalino is especially good served neat or over ice.

The clever bottle design incorporates the dramatic terrain of the

volcano, with a textured relief of the mountain set into the base. The Blanco has a blue tint in homage to the agave it’s made from, while the Cristalino is highlighted in copper, referencing the unique copper stills installed at the distillery to create the perfect tequila.

The handsome vessels took a long time to perfect, with the volcano relief proving particularly difficult to render, but of course there was no thought of cutting corners. The result is not only unique among tequila brands but ultimately worthy of sharing shelf space with the rest of LVMH’s impeccable offerings. Monsieur Arnault, we imagine, must be very pleased.

BLITHE SPIRITS:

THE LVMH PORTFOLIO



Trent Fraser calls Volcan De Mi Tierra “the perfect addition and complement” to LVMH’s unrivaled portfolio of luxury wines and spirits. The new top-shelf tequila brings the number of LVMH’s wine and spirits houses to 23. The oldest, Clos des Lambrays of grand cru Burgundy fame, was founded in 1365. Dom Pérignon (1668), Veuve Clicquot (1772), Hennessy (1765), and Château d’Yquem (1593) are the best known, though not all the brands are French in origin. In the spirits category, Poland’s Belvedere Vodka, founded in 1993 and acquired by LVMH in 2005, is the second newest after Volcan.

Maison Hennessy, one of the pillars of the group, is the sixth oldest among its holdings and the unrivaled leader in the cognac category. Over the course of 250 years, it has been the favorite tipple of everyone from English kings to rap moguls, and continues to make waves with eye-popping new offerings like Hennessy 8, a $39,000-per-bottle tribute to eight generations of master blenders from the same family. A new visitors center welcomes the public to the Maison’s home on the banks of the Charente River.

Across the Channel you’ll need Glenmorangie, produced in the Scottish Highlands since 1843. The lush single malt boasts an impressive history, but since its acquisition by LVMH in 2004, it has become a leader in innovation as well. Now truly a modern luxury brand, Glenmorangie has expanded the horizons of single malt Scotch with rare finishes and elite expressions.

Glenmorangie Original, an elegant 10-year-old with floral notes, continues to be the gold standard, but the brand has also experimented with different casks and maturation methods. One of the most delectable results is Bacalta, first matured in former bourbon casks, then extra-matured in bespoke casks “baked under the sun” that once contained highly prized Madeira from the islands of the same name off the coast of Portugal.

Glenmorangie House, the brand’s picture-perfect country gentleman’s estate located near the historic distillery, where tours are also conducted, was once the preserve of VIPs and company execs. These days it’s available for private bookings, allowing single malt enthusiasts the ultimate immersion experience. There are six bedrooms in the main house, which is stocked with all of Glenmorangie’s gorgeous whiskies. Now that’s our idea of luxury.

The effect is almost punk — exaggerated, impolite, bold.

That’s just how Hewitt, 23, wants it. “Rule Breaker,” “Revolution” and “Change the Rules” are cheeky names for garments in the collection, but they could also be earnest taglines for Maggie Marilyn, the eponymous line that Hewitt launched last September. “There’s a freeness and playfulness in the clothes,” she says. “The feeling that you’re not conformed or constricted by anything.”

Hewitt executes her own nonconformities — cinched sleeves on a “board roomy” men’s shirt; a flouncy dress cut from power-suit pinstripes — with such confidence that it’s easy to forget how young she is. Less than a year out of Auckland’s Whitecliffe College of Arts and Design, her first season debuted at last year’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, where it was immediately snapped up by Net-a-Porter. This summer, she was shortlisted for the 2017 LVMH Prize by a panel of judges including Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs and Phoebe Philo.

Though Hewitt calls herself “very ambitious,” she admits that “the pace that everything has moved at is quite incredible.” For a newcomer and relative outsider (she’s the first New Zealander to be an LVMH nominee), such enthusiastic reception from the fashion world came as something of a surprise. “Being creative can be quite solitary,” Hewitt says. “You don’t know how the rest of the world is going to perceive your work.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999985933303833}",neutral,0.999985933303833,0

The brand, which was sold off by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton almost exactly a year ago in light of years of lackluster growth, has lacked any big names at its helm since ousting Public School founders Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne late last year.

Caroline Brown, chief executive officer of Donna Karan International, also left the company around the same time, leaving the upper ranks of Donna Karan’s brand looking a bit sparse. To top matters off, the brand opted out of showing its Fall/Winter 2017 collection during New York Fashion Week this past February. It is not also not on the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s official Spring/Summer 2018 calendar of shows, which will take place in September.

As such, DKNY has swapped out Bella Hadid – who fronted the brand’s Spring/Summer 2017 campaign – for fellow Instagram famous model (and actress) Emily Ratajkowski for its Fall/Winter 2017 ready-to-wear campaign. Ratajkowski has appeared in prior campaigns for DKNY’s underwear line. The garments – which are logo-heavy athleisure wares – are nothing to write home about.

It is nothing if not clear that DKNY, in its current state, is stagnating, but maybe not for long. Its parent company G-III Apparel says it is in the process of rolling out a new Donna Karan and DKNY, and that it is “optimistic” about the next few years with those brands. The Donna Karan brand could, eventually, be one of its largest, according to NASDAQ.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9875757694244385}",neutral,0.9875757694244385,0

LVMH’s private equity firm L Catterton Asia has been in talks with Gentle Monster’s parent company Snoop Buy since March to invest about 130 billion won (US$115 million) in the Korean firm valued at about 700-800 billion won.











However, the talks have stalled as other investors are reportedly offering higher funds.



“Considering Snoop Buy’s tepid stance, it is likely that some investors could have proposed almost 1 trillion won funding,” an investment banker was quoted as saying by Maeil Business News.



Snoop Buy plans to go public on the local stock market once the investment bids are finalized. Mirae Asset Daewoo is the lead deal advisor, along with the secondary Shinyoung Securities, Hana Financial and KB Securities.



Gentle Monster, launched in 2011 with an initial capital of 50 million, has grown into a leading sunglass brand with attractive designs and competitive pricing. Its daily revenue is about 150 million won at Lotte Department Store alone.



Its popularity among Asian visitors skyrocketed when Korean actress Jeon Ji-hyun wore its sunglasses in the drama “My Love from the Star.”

The vehicle was en route to combat a hungry fire sweeping Shangri-la, the town where Dulou and his wife had just taken up residence.

There was no alternative; the Chinese firefighters’ access to water was restricted.

It was a cold January and the underground water pipes – laid to deal with such catastrophes – had been emptied by the authorities, for fear that they would burst from being frozen. The bulldozer, with its ability to create a “break” in the flammable homes, was the only effective tool left.

Things work differently in China, the Bordelais winemaker reflects, as he recounted surveying the wreckage.

It is at this point that a lesser man might have regretted his decision to leave a cushy job in Bordeaux as winemaker of LVMH-owned Chateau Quinault, in Saint Emilion. Dulou was there for eight years, learning the tricks of the trade from the team behind the legendary Cheval Blanc. Why give that up to head Ao Yun, then an unknown label from mountainous Yunnan, China?

“It is every winemaker’s dream to create something that’s never been done before. Something that will be remembered,” explains Dulou, who’s now in Singapore to promote Ao Yun’s second release, the 2014 vintage. He’s leaning so far forward in his chair that I can almost feel the conviction and excitement emanating from him. “It’s one big adventure.”

SETTING SIGHTS HIGH

The clarion call to establish LVMH’s next wine frontier came in 2012. Revered wine scientist Tony Jordan had just concluded an arduous four-year search across China for terroir that would be ideal for producing world-class red.

“(Northern) China would have been too warm in summer, so you’d lose a lot of freshness and acidity, which in turn reduces the wine’s elegance. You’d also lose a lot of quality when you bury the vines in winter,” explains Dulou. “In the south, summer is too wet, so instead of ripening and producing tannins and phenolic components, (the grapes) are going to grow, so you have poor colour and structure. They’ll also be prone to a lot of diseases, which means they can’t be managed organically.”

Jordan’s “grail” came in the form of four farming villages in south-western Yunnan, thanks to ample elevation and mountainous surroundings. Moet Hennessy took out leases in all four. The stage was now set for Dulou to take the reins, although he was indecisive when the opportunity came.

“It was a dream job; I wanted to create, and at Saint Emilion everything was already done. But during our first visit to Yunnan, I got a little sick from the altitude and so hesitated. But my wife, who is very adventurous, pushed me (to take the post),” he says with a laugh.

Befitting the remarkable altitudes involved, the project was named Ao Yun, which loosely translates to “wandering the clouds”.

(RELATED: Why Bordeaux dominates the wine market.)

SURMOUNTING DIFFICULTIES

As Dulou was about to find out, that romantic setting would come at a cost. Getting hardware, stable electricity and a reliable water supply up to the remote villages proved “a logistics nightmare”.

Even now, electricity may get cut at the winery situated at Adong, the highest of the four villages. A standalone power generator had to be hauled up hours of mountain road, to ensure expensive machinery didn’t fail mid-task.

Dulou, however, finds that the most meaningful adaptations have been his reaching an understanding with the Tibetan farmers, who form the bulk of the operation. “There are some periods when it is difficult to get people in the vineyards,” he says. “For example, if somebody passes away, the whole village will not come to work for two days. You need to know this (about them).”

Dulou’s solution? “We work twice as hard, two days later.”

To complicate matters, a good proportion of the workforce absents itself from May to August, as highly lucrative harvests of Himalayan truffle, matsutake mushroom and cordyceps come into season. He adds: “We respect that too. We just make sure that at least one person from each family stays with the vineyard so we have enough manpower for important operations.”

Yet there are many boons to working with a populace for whom farming is more than a career path, but an entire way of life. He says: “In French vineyards, you will have many students learning viticulture. Here, the farmers are already connected with the land, the animals. There is a virtuous cycle; they don’t buy compost as they make their own, and when they pluck unuseable vines, they feed it to the animals instead of throwing it away.”

His first order of business was to switch the farmers from their “sell-by-kilogram” mindset to one that prioritised the quality of grapes. “They understood very quickly because they are such good farmers.”

A MEMORABLE GLASS

The elephant in the room, of course, is how Ao Yun can overcome the less-than-lukewarm attitudes of wine cognoscenti towards a nascent wine region. Dulou is the first to admit that it will be a long road, but not one that is hard to undertake. “We have, of course, many sceptics. But what we do is to fly them over and let them see the process and taste (the wine) for themselves. And then they become our best ambassadors.”

The first of such converts was respected British wine critic Jancis Robinson, who tasted some lots before they were even bottled. She went on to write: “What I was tasting were wines most influenced by the pure vineyard characters. They were fully ripe but extremely well balanced with real, confident, unique personalities of their own.”

Post-interview, at the tasting of the 2014 vintage, Dulou earns his next fans. Sounds of approval and earnest smacking of lips fill the room as we savour the elegant blend that is 90 per cent cabernet sauvignon and 10 per cent cabernet franc. Reserved minerality and soft, rounded tannins let smoky notes of banana linger on the tongue; an exquisitely long finish one would ascribe to a top-quality wine. The 91- to 94-point Ao Yun 2013 has a worthy successor.

“Tashi delek,” I say to Dulou when it’s time to leave, a Tibetan phrase he taught me earlier. It means “good luck”. But as I watch him exchange sincere farewells with the departing crowd, a tired but fulfilled craftsman eager to create history, I decide he may not need much luck at all.

(RELATED: Gender Did Matter, says First Female Winemaker of respected Burgundy winery, Hospices de Beaune.)

CLEARING THE AIR

These reservations are often aired by those new to Ao Yun.

IS THE WINE TOO EXPENSIVE?

Last year’s vintage cost upwards of $300 – yet producing Ao Yun takes four times the man hours as top French labels, Chateau d’Yquem included. Harvesting and tending is done entirely by hand, and the vineyards are 100 per cent organic. The project is, in fact, not going to turn a profit for a while.

CAN SUCH YOUNG VINEYARDS PRODUCE GOOD GRAPES?

Half of the 30ha had actually been planted in the early 2000s, long before any LVMH involvement. The land was thus already yielding good grapes.

DOES THE NAME MEAN ‘OLYMPICS’?

It means “roaming (among) the clouds”. The Romanisation of the Chinese name 敖云 into “Ao Yun” introduces a lot of ambiguity as it can be pronounced in many ways, and hence misconstrued. Two of the most commonly botched interpretations are “proud cloud” and “Olympics”.

Burnaby may soon be getting its own luxury zone, if a new partnership between mega-development the Amazing Brentwood and private equity firm L Catterton Real Estate—which is backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest high-end retail conglomerate—is any indication.

Shape Properties, the real-estate management team behind the Amazing Brentwood, announced LCRE’s investment in the project today (August 1). LCRE’s interest in the two-billion-dollar-plus site signals that the corporation believes that the Amazing Brentwood will attract a large assortment of the world’s top labels, explains Shape’s executive vice president, Darren Kwiatkowski.

“It’s a strong vote of confidence in the project and, I would say, in the region,” he tells the Straight by phone, adding that this is the first time that LCRE has supported a Canadian endeavor.

With funding from LVMH, which counts brands such as Celine, Louis Vuitton, and Fendi in its portfolio, LCRE has played a part in the launch of luxury developments like the Miami Design District and Tokyo’s ritzy Ginza Six. Both of these retail centres boast LVMH subsidiaries such as Bulgari, Givenchy, and Dior, which may offer consumers a hint of things to come in Burnaby.

“They have a seat at the table, for sure,” Kwiatkowski says of LCRE’s role in the outreach and decision-making process that will determine what labels call the Amazing Brentwood home.

Shape Properties

Kwiatkowski won’t share what brands his team has already contacted, or hopes to lease retail space to, though he does mention that, with two years until the project’s first-phase completion, “we’ve reached out to a lot of them.”

In addition to luxury names, Kwiatkowski would like to see a selection of homegrown and independently owned stores among the Amazing Brentwood’s 250-plus expected shops. He says that the development’s status as a mixed-used urban centre, rather than a traditional mall, makes it well suited for a blend of luxury and local retailers, like in a city’s downtown core.

“We love that combination of cool local boutiques with international brands,” Kwiatkowski notes. “We want to have the full spectrum.”

At the moment, the majority of Vancouver's high-end labels are concentrated on the stretch of Alberni between Burrard and Thurlow streets and the surrounding area, which has subsequently been dubbed ""Luxury Row"". The Amazing Brentwood's introduction of such brands could potentially relieve the crunch for retail space in this zone, which, in recent years, has been taken up by Rolex, Saint Laurent, Moncler, and others.

Spanning over 28 acres, the Amazing Brentwood will include 2.5 million square feet of retail and restaurant space upon completion. This is in addition to the 6,000 homes and office and commercial spaces that will be produced over 11 hi-rise towers.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Cineplex will open B.C.’s first Rec Room, a massive food-and-entertainment district, and an almost 21,000-square-foot VIP Cinema at the Amazing Brentwood. More tenants—retail and otherwise—will be released as the project approaches its spring 2019 first-phase opening date.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999432563781738}",neutral,0.9999432563781738,0

The new retail space, named The Amazing Brentwood, will include over 250 shops, restaurants, office space and a one-acre plaza connected to the Brentwood SkyTrain station.

To help lead the new retail, the developer SHAPE has announced a partnership with L Catterton Real Estate (LCRE), the real estate investment and development arm of LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton and its holding company Groupe Arnault.

LCRE’s projects are world-renowned for award-winning architecture and design, high profile public art and upscale retail.

The partnership with SHAPE and The Amazing Brentwood will leverage LCRE’s experience in launching globally acclaimed projects including the Miami Design District and Ginza SIX in Tokyo.

“We are excited and privileged to welcome LCRE in their first Canadian endeavour and second in the Americas,” said John Horton, president of SHAPE. “This partnership is the perfect fit for SHAPE’s mandate to create a completely new, culturally relevant experience designed for the future of retail. LCRE’s partnership is a huge vote of confidence in the project and validation that The Amazing Brentwood will serve as a point of pride for Vancouver and a sought-after destination for visitors worldwide.”

The new residential towers at The Amazing Brentwood will bring over 10,000 new residents to the 28-acre property.

The first three residential towers have sold out in record time and construction on the first phase of development is well underway. Phase one is expected to open in 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.998211145401001}",neutral,0.998211145401001,0
