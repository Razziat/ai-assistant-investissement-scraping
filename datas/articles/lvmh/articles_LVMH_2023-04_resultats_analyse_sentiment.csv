Birkin bag maker sees pickup in US demand for its pricey products - CNN,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xMy9pbnZlc3RpbmcvbHZtaC1yZXN1bHRzLWNoaW5hLXJlb3BlbmluZy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNC8xMy9pbnZlc3RpbmcvbHZtaC1yZXN1bHRzLWNoaW5hLXJlb3BlbmluZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNN —

Uber-luxury brand Hermès, best known for its coveted Birkin handbag, reported a double-digit jump in sales as high-income shoppers continue to spend on pricey products.

Paris-based Hermès said Thursday that sales rose 23% in the first quarter, driven by rising demand in all of its international markets. Sales in the Americas rose 19% off “good momentum” in the US and were up 23% in Asia (excluding Japan) as wealthy shoppers in China flocked to the brand.

Store traffic in the US also continued to rise, said Eric du Halgouet, executive vice president of finance for Hermès, according to a report.

The results, along with the quarterly earnings of other purveyors of high-end products, show that some status symbols and big spenders are undeterred by economic uncertainty.

Getting a Birkin handbag, which can sell from $10,000 at retail to record premiums of $450,000 at auction, directly from its maker is a difficult feat — one often achieved through celebrity status or at the least a spending history with Hermès. The brand produces only a limited quantity for sale each year.

Yet demand remains so high that earlier this month, Hermès opened a new manufacturing plant in eastern France. Besides its handmade handbags, the luxury goods company also produces ready-to-wear fashion, silk scarves, shoes, watches and saddlery.

Hermès isn’t the only company with rising fortunes rise during a slowdown in the global economy. Shares in LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, jumped to a record high after it reported strong first-quarter sales buoyed by the economic re-opening in China.

The stock of Europe’s most valuable company rose 4.6% Thursday to hit €875 ($965) apiece, boosting the fortune of its owner Bernard Arnault, already the world’s richest man.

LVMH (LVMHF) was targeted by opponents of French President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reforms on Thursday. Protesters taking part in a nationwide strike against an increase in the retirement age forced their way into the company’s headquarters in Paris.

“If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,” Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the building.

The owner of brands such as Tiffany & Co. and Dior reported late on Wednesday sales of €21 billion ($17 billion) in the first three months of the year, up 17% from the same period in 2022.

The conglomerate said first-quarter sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 14% year-over-year, which represented a “significant rebound.”

Sales were lifted by the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in Asia, LVMH said in a statement. China ended its strict zero-Covid policy in December.

“We registered some pretty nice pick-up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,” Jean-Jacques Guinoy, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said Wednesday.

The company’s cosmetics lines were still a “little under pressure” in mainland China, Guinoy added, though leather goods and jewelry were performing well in the world’s second-biggest economy.

“Overall, we are extremely optimistic,” he said.

In Europe and Japan, first-quarter sales were strong, rising 24% and 34% respectively, thanks to “robust demand” from local consumers and international travelers. In the United States, sales rose 8%.

Stocks in the $460 billion company have rocketed 29% since the start of the year, with the luxury goods market proving resilient in the face of high global inflation and fears that some economies could tip into recession.

Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, overtook Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person in December, with a total net worth of $198 billion to Musk’s $176 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Shares in LVMH closed up 90 euro cents (0.1%) to €902.00 (£798.30) on Monday giving the company – whose roster includes Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer watches and Bulgari and Tiffany jewellery – a market capitalisation of €454bn, or half a trillion dollars.

LVMH shares have soared by 30% so far this year propelling it into the top 10 of the world’s most valuable listed companies.

The new valuation puts the stake held by its chair and chief executive, Bernard Arnault, at $212bn – cementing his position as the world’s richest person, $47bn ahead of Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, in second place.

Earlier this month LVMH reported a 17% increase in first quarter sales, more than double analyst expectations. Last year it achieved record sales of €79.2bn and has begun a €1.5bn share buyback programme.

Luxury rival Hermès, the maker of £5,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, reported a 23% jump in first quarter sales earlier this month. Other luxury goods companies including Kering (which owns Balenciaga and Gucci) and Burberry have also seen their share prices soar.

Arnault, who co-founded the luxury goods group 35 years ago, recently appointed his children to key roles within the business. In January, his eldest child, Delphine, was named the head of Christian Dior, the second-biggest brand in the empire. Her brother Antoine was promoted to run the holding company that controls LVMH and the Arnault family fortune.

LVMH becomes Europe's most valuable company at $500 billion - Euronews,"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDQvMjUvbHZtaC1iZWNvbWVzLWV1cm9wZXMtbW9zdC12YWx1YWJsZS1jb21wYW55LWF0LTQ1NS1iaWxsaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French company LVMH, owned by the world's richest man, is Europe's first company to break the $500 billion (€455 billion) barrier.

LVMH, the French luxury company made up of fashion brand Louis Vuitton and drinks companies Moët and Hennessy, is the first European company with a market value above $500 billion (around €455 billion).

The Paris Stock Exchange closed on Monday night with LVMH stocks up 0.1 per cent to a value of €902. It was the end of a day in which the Paris stock exchange broke records with an all-time highest value of 7,581.25 points.

The success of LVMH, which owns 75 luxury brands including Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer, and Bulgari, is due to a growing demand from the wealthiest parts of society.

LVMH alongside Hermès and L'Oréal represent a third of the CAC 40 - the top 40 most significant stocks in the French stock exchange. These companies “have become safe havens for the markets and this capitalisation of LVMH surprises few,” notes Ilana Azuelos-Bossard, deputy director at Kiplink Finance.

Earlier this month, LVMH became one of the top-10 best-valued companies in the world. It’s clearly a very good time for the top end of French luxury retail. Among the top three French companies, Hermès is the fastest growing. They’ve seen a 23 per cent increase in sales in Q1 this year.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault worked alongside Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy’s CEOs to form the current company in 1987. As the founder and chairman of LVMH, Arnault is the current richest person in the world.

In his early seventies, Arnault’s position has led to multiple questions of potential successors. All five of Arnault's children hold senior positions in LVMH and its brands.

Antoine, 45, is vice-chairman and former CEO of Christian Dior; Alexandre, 30, is an executive vice president at Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric, 28, serves as the CEO of Tag Heuer; and the youngest of the five siblings, Jean, 24, is the director of watches development and marketing at Louis Vuitton.

But it is eldest daughter Delphine, 48, who Arnault recently named CEO of Christian Dior who seems tipped as the ultimate successor.

The significance of LVMH as a global player can’t be overstated. They are likely to be a major sponsor at the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, although the competition hasn’t officially announced a sponsorship deal with any fashion house yet.

On a more individual level, LVMH has coupled up with major stars like BTS singer J-Hope as ambassadors, alongside four new young ambassadors in a drive to ethically repurpose spare fabrics left over from their products.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989035129547119}",neutral,0.9989035129547119,0

LVMH is shifting resources out of Hong Kong, reflecting waning interest in what used to be Asia’s premium shopping hub as mainland Chinese consumers switch to shopping at home.

To that end, it’s already moved the regional headquarters of some brands, including the group’s local head office, to Shanghai, and relocated some senior executives to the mainland, the people said.

A spokesperson for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE declined to comment and pointed to the company’s recent earnings announcements.

The financial hub has long been a luxury shopping mecca for mainland tourists drawn in by its lower prices and broader array of product offerings. But fortunes took a turn in 2019, when months of anti-government protests kept many visitors away, while the pandemic dealt an even bigger blow with China sealing itself off from the world as part of Covid Zero. Devoid of shoppers, major retailers began shutting stores across Hong Kong’s glitziest retail strips.

For LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany & Co., the post-Covid recovery has been much slower in Hong Kong than elsewhere in Greater China, according to one of the people.

The company expects the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically to continue, with the portion of total luxury spending that’s done within the mainland expected to almost double from pre-Covid levels, one of the people said. The conglomerate doesn’t break down Greater China sales figures by location in its public results.

LVMH is already reaping the benefits of China’s reopening to the world, with a rush of shoppers unleashing a massive wave of spending that boosted sales and pushed shares to a record this month. The country’s bullish longer-term prospects have made moving closer to the major growth market increasingly attractive, and some of the biggest names in luxury have already been expanding their presence in the mainland.

That’s spurred the rise of shopping centres like the duty-free island of Hainan and the gambling hub of Macau , which are likely to further erode Hong Kong’s significance.

Duty-free sales in Hainan more than tripled to 49.5 billion yuan (US$7.2 billion) in 2021 from 2019, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Even during last year’s Covid Zero chaos, sales were still more than twice the size of pre-pandemic levels, and the island province is well-positioned to benefit from policies to boost onshore spending in China, they said.

Hong Kong’s neighbour, Macau, is also emerging as an up-and-coming luxury destination able to offer cheaper prices as well as a broader holiday experience for mainland Chinese tourists. The gambling hub’s visitor arrivals recovered to about 62 per cent of 2019 levels over this month’s Easter holiday – versus 44 per cent for Hong Kong – building on a tourism boom during January’s Lunar New Year break.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996176958084106}",neutral,0.9996176958084106,0

Arnault has a net worth of $208 billion, according to Bloomberg, and surpassed Elon Musk in December to become the world’s richest person. He began building LVMH, which now owns a number of companies including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Fendi, in 1984 with his acquisition of Christian Dior.

Earlier this month, LVMH’s market valuation hit $486 billion, briefly making it the world’s 10th biggest company. Arnault, 74, also raised the company’s retirement age from 75 to 80 in March 2022.

The LVMH head has two children, Delphine and Antoine, from his prior marriage to Anne Dewavrin, followed by three sons, Alexandre, Frederic and Jean, with his current wife Helene Mercier.

In addition to bringing his children along to business trips and negotiations throughout their childhoods, he reportedly questions each of them on pre-prepared business topics during a monthly lunch held at the LVMH headquarters in Paris.

While he has not publicly stated who will replace him, the decision will be based “on merit,” according to the Wall Street Journal. All five of Arnault’s children have worked at LVMH throughout the years and currently hold executive roles at company.

Delphine Arnault, 48

Delphine, Arnault’s eldest child, was in January announced as the CEO and chair of Christian Dior, LVMH’s second largest brand. “Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior,” said Arnault in a statement at the time.

After graduating from the EDHEC Business School in Lille, France, and the London School of Economics, Delphine worked at consulting firm McKinsey for two years. In 2001 she began working at designer John Galliano’s company, before moving to Christian Dior the next year and later holding the position of deputy managing director from 2008 to 2013.

For the past decade, Delphine was Louis Vuitton’s executive vice president. She has also been a member of LVMH’s board since 2013 and on its executive committee since 2019.

Delphine serves on the boards of Pucci, Loewe and Celine, and was recently named to the board of Gagosian Gallery.

Antoine Arnault, 45

In December, Antoine was named CEO of Christian Dior SE, a holding company that owns the majority of the Arnault stake in LVMH.

Antoine, who attended HEC Montreal and Insead Business School, launched digital company Domainoo, which registered celebrity domains, before joining LVMH’s marketing department in 2005, and joining the company’s board in 2006.

He later became the director of communication at Louis Vuitton in 2007, overseeing its “Core Values” campaign consisting of photographs taken by Annie Leibovitz of stars such as Muhammad Ali and Angelina Jolie posing with Louis Vuitton bags.

Since 2012, Antoine has headed Berluti, a men’s shoe company owned by LVMH. Under his leadership, the company reportedly saw sales increase from $45 million to $130 million in 2013. He was also named chairman of cashmere brand Loro Piana when it was acquired by the conglomerate in 2013.

Alexandre Arnault, 30

Alexandre, Arnault’s middle child, is currently the executive vice president of Tiffany & Co, which LVMH acquired in 2021 in a $15.8 billion deal. Under his leadership, Tiffany & Co has collaborated with streetwear brand Supreme and launched a campaign starring Jay-Z and Beyonce.

Alexandre, who is reportedly close friends with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, received a bachelor’s degree from Telecom Paris and a masters from Polytechnique, the latter of which his father attended.

He interned at both McKinsey and investment firm KKR & Co before becoming an investment manager at LVMH in 2015, where he led the company’s launch of e-commerce platform 23 Sèvre and its acquisition of luxury luggage brand RIMOWA.

Alexandre became RIMOWA’s CEO in 2016 and oversaw the brand’s numerous partnerships with Supreme, Off-White and Fendi.

Frederic Arnault, 28

Announced as the CEO of watchmaker TAG Heuer in 2020, Frederic has worked at the LVMH-owned company since 2017. Moving the company towards e-commerce, which grew by 329 percent in 2020, Frederic has spearheaded TAG Heuer’s pivot away from promotional deals with soccer and towards motorsports through his partnership with Porsche.

Like Alexandre, Frederic attended Polytechnique and held a summer internship at McKinsey, before running a mobile payment startup that was sold to French investment firm BNP. He also had a brief stint working as a paramedic for the Paris Fire Brigade, according to his LinkedIn.

Jean Arnault, 24

Jean, Arnault’s youngest child, became the director of marketing and development at Louis Vuitton’s watch division in 2021. He recently launched the Louis Vuitton Watch Prize for Independent Creatives, awarded to those looking to sell their own watch designs.

Jean obtained a degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London, where he conducted a TAG Heuer-sponsored project on watch oscillators, before receiving a master’s in financial mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He held internships at Morgan Stanley and the McLaren Formula 1 team, later starting at LVMH as a sales associate in 2017.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",neutral,0.9999932050704956,0
LVMH Raises €1 Billion in Oversubscribed Bond Sale - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXJhaXNlcy0xLWJpbGxpb24taW4tb3ZlcnN1YnNjcmliZWQtYm9uZC1zYWxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investors piled in for LVMH’s first debt sale in three years, as the luxury goods maker seized on stellar quarterly results as well as calmer conditions in Europe’s credit market.

Demand for the Paris-based owner of Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton closed above €2.7 billion ($2.95 billion) for €1 billion of new bonds due in 2025, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorised to speak publicly. Interest had peaked at €3.6 billion during marketing before the final price was set.

The bond is LVMH’s first venture into global debt markets since April 2020, when the company sold debt in the wake of the pandemic. That sale came soon after a huge deal in February to support the acquisition of Tiffany & Co.

CreditSights Inc. analysts, including Maryum Ali, said LVMH benefits from “exceptionally strong credit fundamentals.” She highlighted its low leverage and good free cash flow.

Today’s deal comes after LVMH reported first-quarter organic sales growth in its fashion and leather goods unit of 18 percent — almost twice what analysts were expecting and spurring a new record high for the stock. It also comes as a major credit risk measure in Europe falls back near levels seen before the recent banking sector turmoil.

Cargill Inc and Eurogrid GmbH are among other companies marketing new deals in the region on Monday, with market participants expecting deals to pick up this week.

The strong demand allowed LVMH to significantly reduce the spread on offer by about 22 basis points to 7 basis points below mid-swaps, according to the person familiar. In the current environment of rate hikes, it has become rare for a corporate offering to price below mid-swaps, showing the pull of a big name like LVMH.

Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Societe Generale SA and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. are working on the deal.

A spokesperson for LVMH declined to comment.

Sales growth was driven by fashion and leather goods, but also by duty-free sales and by the good performance of Sephora.

Europe and Japan, which enjoyed strong growth momentum, benefited from robust demand from local customers and international travellers; the United States, a market which continues to grow, had a steady performance, and Asia experienced a significant rebound following the lifting of health restrictions, including in China.

In the Selective Retailing division, which includes Sephora and DFS (duty free), revenue has jumped by 30% in the first quarter of 2023 (+28% organically). According to LVMH, Sephora saw exceptional performance over the quarter and continued to gain market share. Momentum was particularly strong in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. The brand continued to expand its distribution network, particularly in the United Kingdom where, already present online, its first store in London enjoyed “an excellent start.” DFS benefited from the recovery of international travel and, in particular, from the gradual return of travellers to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macao.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Fendi...) recorded 18% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023 (+18% organically).

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group continued its strategy focused on highly selective distribution, delivering an 11% increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2023 (+10% organically). Christian Dior achieved a remarkable performance and continued to strengthen its lead. Its iconic Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’Adore fragrances were significant channels of growth. Make-up and skincare also contributed to the performance of the Maison. Guerlain benefited from the success of its Aqua Allegoria line. A new liquid foundation enriched the iconic Terracotta collection. Parfums Givenchy unveiled its new fragrance Gentleman Society. Benefit successfully expanded its The Porefessional skincare range, while Fenty Beauty benefited from the strong visibility given to the brand by Rihanna during the American Super Bowl.

Demonstrators pushed their way into the building at 22 Avenue Montaigne in the city’s tony 8th arrondissement. Protesters did not enter any of the stores on the nearby Avenue des Champs-Élysées.

Videos posted on social media showed dozens of protesters, many wearing CGT union vests, bashing down the glass doors of the building while holding red flares and waving flags. They remained in the lobby for about ten minutes before exiting the building.

Protesters are asking for the legislation to be withdrawn. Macron used a constitutional loophole to push through the legislation last month. The country’s constitutional council will issue its ruling on the reform Friday.

The pension reform bill would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years old. The increase in retirement age is meant to reflect a difference in life expectancy for various generations. When most of France’s current retirees entered the workforce in the 1980s, the average life expectancy was 74. Now the average life expectancy in France is 82.

The protests comes just a day after the Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy parent company reported revenues rose 17 percent to 21.04 billion euros for the first quarter of 2023 despite “a geopolitical and economic environment which remains uncertain.”

Chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault is considered the richest man in the world, passing Tesla and Twitter owner Elon Musk, with an estimated net worth of $211 billion. He has added $53 billion to his net worth over the last year, with soaring sales at his luxury brands.

The French group employs more than 150,000 people.

A spokesperson for LVMH declined to comment. The CGT Union did not respond to requests for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999875545501709}",neutral,0.999875545501709,0
French protesters storm headquarters of luxury giant LVMH - CNN,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xMy9ldXJvcGUvZnJhbmNlLXByb3Rlc3RzLXBlbnNpb25zLWx2bWgtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNC8xMy9ldXJvcGUvZnJhbmNlLXByb3Rlc3RzLXBlbnNpb25zLWx2bWgtaW50bA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris CNN —

Hundreds of thousands of people took part in a fresh round of demonstrations across France on Thursday over government plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, a day before a crucial court ruling on the constitutionality of the divisive law.

Protesters in Paris forced their way into the headquarters of luxury giant LVMH, on the day shares in the company – which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moët – jumped to a record high.

“If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,” Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the LVMH building.

Multiple flare ups have taken place throughout the day.

Police halted a protest in front of the Constitutional Council, France’s equivalent of the US supreme court, which will hand down a long-awaited ruling on the validity of the pension reform law on Friday. A ban on protests in the area is in place from Thursday evening until Saturday morning local time.

CNN teams on the ground witnessed protesters engaging in intense scuffles with police as smoke bombs, projectiles and tear gas were fired, before a group set off red flares outside the court building.

Violence also broke out at Paris’ Place de la Bastille as riot police clashed with angry protestors.

“At least a thousand radical individuals present at the forefront of the demonstration area tried on several occasions to commit acts of violence along the route and to hinder the smooth progress of the demonstration,” a spokesman for the Paris police said.

The police were also seen protecting the BHV department store by charging at protesters in the Rue de Rivoli in central Paris.

The police arrested 47 people in Paris and at least ten police officers were injured, according to Paris police prefecture.

Around 380,000 people attended the protests across France on Thursday, 42,000 of whom were in Paris, according to the latest figures from the French interior ministry.

The figure is down from last week’s 11th round of demonstrations which drew in crowds of approximately 570,000.

Police had been expecting further violent attacks that have been a visible, if minor, feature of the protests across France over the past two and a half months, with particular attention on so-called “black bloc” protesters, part of a radical fringe that has been present from the start of the country’s social upheaval.

Macron pushing reform

France’s President Emmanuel Macron argues reforms are essential to rein in public finances, and has been standing firm, this week saying “the country must continue to move forward.”

Speaking at an incinerator picket line near Paris on Thursday morning, Sophie Binet, the new head of the GGT, one of France’s main unions, insisted: “As long as the pension reform is not withdrawn, the mobilization will continue one way or another.”

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire defended his government’s contested pension reform plans to CNN on Thursday as “vital”, saying “we need to ensure to French citizens that there is a financial balance by 2030. This is the purpose of the reform.”

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo voiced her support for the demonstrators before the new round of protests.

“On the eve of the decision of the constitutional council, I am once again supporting the mobilisations in Paris and everywhere in France,” Hidalgo tweeted.

“This reform is unjust and violent. The French have been asking for it to be withdrawn for months, the government has to hear them,” she wrote.

Friday’s ruling will be decisive on whether the protests will continue. The CFDT, France’s other main union, has been more amenable to a negotiated settlement.

Garbage is meanwhile also set to fill the streets of Paris once more as collectors and incinerator workers are on strike again, according to the CGT union.

This will be a rolling strike, the general secretary of the CGT union branch confirmed in a letter to the Paris mayor.

The previous near month-long strike, up until the end of March, had seen 10,000 tonnes of rubbish piled up across the capital at its worst.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9914717078208923}",neutral,0.9914717078208923,0

Bernard Arnault Says LVMH Will Name New Head of Fashion Group - WWD,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXRvLW5hbWUtbmV3LWhlYWQtb2YtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC1kaXZpc2lvbi0xMjM1NjIxNjcyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is preparing to name a new head of its Fashion Group division as Sidney Toledano transitions into another role at the French luxury group, chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said Thursday.

Speaking at the annual general meeting of shareholders, Arnault thanked Toledano for his leadership during a career at LVMH spanning almost three decades, first at Christian Dior and since 2018 as head of the LVMH Fashion Group, which oversees brands including Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs and Pucci.

“I wanted to underline the exceptional job he has done. He’s not leaving. No, he will take on another role,” Arnault said.

“We will continue to work together in a different framework. I won’t say anything further, but I will tell you about it next year in any case. A big thank you, Sidney, for your terrific work during all these years,” he added, prompting warm applause from the audience.

The luxury executive’s comments come days after a report on independent news site Miss Tweed that Michael Burke, another veteran LVMH executive, was the frontrunner to succeed Toledano as head of the Fashion Group. LVMH declined to comment on the story.

A source with knowledge of the matter said the name of Toledano’s successor would be revealed in the next few months, but the decision had yet to be finalized.

Revenues in the division have swelled under Toledano’s watch and are now approaching 10 billion euros, according to market sources. It is understood Toledano also increased the business unit’s profitability sixfold. Arnault disclosed that revenues at Celine were now close to 3 billion euros.

At the AGM, Arnault also singled out Burke for praise, noting that he had helped Louis Vuitton to become the first brand in the history of luxury goods to generate annual revenues of more than 20 billion euros.

Burke bowed out as chairman and CEO of Vuitton in February after a stellar 10-year tenure to “take up new responsibilities, reporting directly to Bernard Arnault,” LVMH said. He would seem a natural successor for Toledano, since the two men are close, and Burke has been part of Arnault’s inner circle since he founded LVMH in the 1980s.

Responding to a question from a shareholder, Arnault confirmed that LVMH is in talks to become a partner of the organizing committee of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. Worldwide partners include Alibaba Group, Omega and P&G. Carrefour is a premium partner, while Decathlon and Le Coq Sportif are among the official partners.

“Regarding the Olympic Games, the contract you refer to is not signed, it is under negotiation, and like any negotiation, it can end with an agreement or not. So stay tuned,” Arnault said.

Arnault, who recently surpassed Elon Musk as the world’s richest man, also hit back at critics a week after protesters forced their way into LVMH’s Paris headquarters as part of ongoing protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform law, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 64 years old.

Some opponents of the measure have suggested taxing the rich to help fund the pension system instead of asking people to work longer.

“In France, we are criticized,” said Arnault, referring to an unnamed politician who he said had called for the scrapping of the luxury good industry on the grounds that it produces superfluous products.

“Luxury employs 1 million people. So here you have a supposedly responsible politician who is ruthlessly calling for the elimination of a business that employs 1 million people. I’ll let you be the judge,” Arnault continued.

He noted that LVMH, the parent company of brands including Vuitton, Guerlain, Sephora and Moët & Chandon, invests more than 1 billion euros per year in France and hired 15,000 people in its domestic market in 2022.

Arnault also referred to the recent controversy surrounding LVMH’s plan to build a research laboratory on land adjacent to the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique engineering school. LVMH said in January that it would find another location for the 100-million-euro project after current and former Polytechnique students opposed the proposal.

“They said, ‘No, no, it’s better if the state funds it.’ We’ll see. For the time being, it’s an empty field with a couple of frogs in it. We’ll see in 20 years if they’ve done anything with it. In any case, we pulled out because there’s no point getting upset about it,” he said.

“We’ve been invited all over the world, namely in England, in prestigious universities that were not only ready to welcome us, but wanted to subsidize us as well. We’re good French citizens, so we will nonetheless remain in France. Despite all the critics, we remain attached to France,” he said.

Claude Martinez, who recently stepped down as head of Parfums Christian Dior, will supervise the group’s research activities, Arnault added.

Later that day, his son, Antoine, presided over his first AGM as CEO of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH. He paid tribute to Toledano, who preceded him in the role, and saluted his father in comments that signaled the luxury magnate is not ready to hand over the leadership of his group to any of his five children.

“He is today the cement of the unity of our family and a driving force to project ourselves, with him, into the future. In these times when those who take risks and succeed are unfairly criticized or even stigmatized, I would like, on your behalf, to thank him for what he has built,” Antoine told the gathering.

Last year, LVMH shareholders voted in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for Arnault, 74, to serve as CEO. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit.

Responding to a shareholder’s question, Antoine condemned the invasion of the LVMH headquarters by demonstrators, many wearing CGT union vests.

“It was obviously a very unpleasant moment, one we found quite hard to understand. Some reports said it was a non-violent action. I suggest you tell that to the security guard who was burned, who had smoke bombs waved in his face and whose jacket was completely burned, and who could have died, honestly,” he said. “It was absolutely violent.”

Arnault, who is head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, in addition to his roles as CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, suggested that the media was responsible for stoking negative opinions about wealth by reporting on the rankings of the world’s richest people.

“I believe that somewhere, everything you can read about wealth and fortune is presented in a misleading way. When you talk about wealth, you’re not talking about available money, it’s the value of the company in which you are shareholders that’s increasing, which allows us to open more workshops and stores and to continue hiring and training in France,” he argued.

“I was reading last week at around the same time, incidentally, that because the stock had performed well, Bernard Arnault’s wealth had increased by I don’t know how many billion euros, but it’s absurd to present things that way, as if he’d won the lottery and that several billion euros had been transferred to his account,” Antoine continued.

“It’s LVMH as a company that is performing incredibly well,” he concluded. “We should all be happy about that, so we felt this invasion of our headquarters was unfair. We’re part of the solution, not part of the problem.” The audience applauded his comments, which came amid news that protesters had stormed the Paris offices of Pan-European stock exchange Euronext.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999572038650513}",neutral,0.9999572038650513,0

Besides its eponymous products—the fashion lines of Louis Vuitton and the wines and spirits of Moët Hennessy—the Paris-listed conglomerate is also behind a slew of other luxury and lifestyle labels, including Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Christian Dior, and Stella McCartney.

Even before reaching its new sky-high valuation, the French luxury house, founded and run by Bernard Arnault, became the first European firm to slide into the list of the top 10 companies in the world by stock valuation. On the back of upbeat first-quarter sales arlier this month, LVMH clawed its way into a ranking long dominated by US tech behemoths such as Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.

China’s comeback helped LVMH

In January, Arnault said that LVMH had “every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic on China.” He added that if the “green shoots” the company sensed in China continue to grow, “it will be an excellent year.”

By the end of the first quarter, sales were showing promise. While reporting its most recent earnings earlier this month, LVMH noted that “Asia experienced a significant rebound following the lifting of health restrictions.” This included China scrapping covid-19 restrictions after three long years in 2023.

Sales have been buoyed by the return of luxury shopping in China not only for LVMH but also for others such as rival bagmaker Hermès and the British luxury brand Burberry.

To service this group of affluent shoppers, LVMH is gearing up to meet them where they are. The company is reportedly launching a two-story flagship Louis Vuitton store in Hainan, a duty-free haven in China. (Whether the store itself will offer duty-free products is not yet public knowledge.) LVMH also continues to expand further into metros as well as tier-2 and -3 cities such as Fuzhou, Guiyang, and Nanning.

Person of interest: Arnault’s successor

Arnault, who co-founded LVMH 35 years ago, is 74, and he seems to have succession planning on his mind. The tycoon tweaked the structure of his holding company to the kind used by the likes of other French family-owned firms such as Hermes and Michelin, to prevent takeovers and ensure control stays within the bloodline. But the family tree isn’t so straightforward. Arnault has five children from two different marriages to choose from.

In January, Delphine Arnault, Bernard’s 47-year-old daughter and the oldest of his five children, was appointed head of Dior. Antoine Arnault, 45, is CEO of the holding company Christian Dior SE—which controls 41% of the capital and 56% of the voting rights in the LVMH group—and vice chairman of its board of directors.

Arnault’s three younger children also hold important positions in the group: 30-year-old Alexandre Arnault, 28-year-old Frederic Arnault, 24-year-old Jean Arnault oversee the jewelry brand Tiffany, the watch brand Tag Heuer, and Louis Vuitton’s watches division, respectively.

Arnault is in no rush to choose yet. Chairman since 1989, he is considering holding on to his post until his 80th birthday.

By Jessica Mason

LVMH has been named as the first European company to have a market value of over €455 billion (US$500 billion).

The French luxury company, which owns Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot, Cloudy Bay and Château d’Yquem in its wine and Champagne sector, and Hennessy, Glenmorangie, Belvedere in its spirits division, saw its stocks lift to reach an all-time high this week.

According to Euronews, LVMH stocks were up 0.1% to a value of €902 by the close of day on Monday night at The Paris Stock Exchange, helping Euronext reach its highest-ever value of 7,581.25 points.

Earlier this month, LVMH reportedly became one of the top-10 best-valued companies in the world and LVMH founder, chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, who worked alongside Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy’s CEOs to form the current company in 1987, is also currently richest person in the world, worth some US$200 billion.

LVMH sales in the first three months of 2023 recently heralded a return to prosperity, however out of all of the luxury company’s interests, its drinks arm Moët Hennessy showed the least impressive results with sales improving by just 3%.

Despite premiumisation of the Champagne marques pushing revenues ahead by 14%, Hennessy Cognac and other spirits saw sales plummet by 5% over the same period.

LVMH shares have doubled in value in the past three years and key to the spectacular results was Asia where in its first quarter figures saw sales grow by 14% compared with a fall of 8% in the final three months of 2022.

The company also highlighted that Japan was up 34% and indicated that it was a prime driver in the quarter given that China accounts for about 80% of its activity in Asia.

At the start of the year, LVMH offloaded one of Margaret River’s founding five wineries, Cape Mentelle, to Australian retail and hospitality business Endeavour Group in a sale which would see Cape Mentelle joining the Endeavour Group subsidiary Paragon Wine Estate. Around the same time, LVMH’s wine and and spirits division Moët Hennessy acquired a majority stake of Provence rosé producer Château Minuty, adding to a premium rosé portfolio that already includes Château d’Esclans.

These moves followed its acquisition trail last summer when LVMH acquired Napa Valley’s Joseph Phelps Vineyards, which had previously operated under the stewardship of the Phelps family for almost five decades. Speaking about the acquisition, Moët Hennessy CEO Philippe Schaus admitted: “It’s important for us that we are acquiring a family business with a legacy and heritage. It’s super important that we keep that heritage.”

Taking family values and legacy into account, now Arnault is in his seventies, there is much speculation in the industry for him to consider LVMH’s next potential successors and, looking at his five children who all already hold senior positions within the company, his eldest daughter Delphine being rumoured to be the most-likely candidate to fill his shoes. That said, last year, it was suggested that Arnault could potentially remain at the helm of LVMH until he reaches 80 after Reuters reported, citing company filings, that LVMH was looking to raise the age limit for the position of chief executive to 80 at a shareholder meeting.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9915237426757812}",positive,0.9915237426757812,1

On Wednesday, the French luxury giant trumpeted an “excellent start” to 2023, reporting revenues in the first quarter jumped 17 percent thanks to robust demand for leather goods, and sharp increases at Sephora and DFS.

Revenues at the world’s largest luxury conglomerate totaled 21.04 billion euros for the three months ended March 31, despite “a geopolitical and economic environment which remains uncertain.”

The numbers mark an acceleration from the fourth quarter, when sales gained 15 percent, but came in a shade down from the 19 percent logged in the third quarter of 2022.

All business divisions except wines and spirits recorded double-digit gains in first quarter, with LVMH citing “strong growth momentum” in Europe and Japan thanks to both local customers and international travelers, and a “steady performance” in the U.S., which continues to grow.

“Asia experienced a significant rebound following the lifting of health restrictions,” the company noted in a statement issued after the close of trading on the Paris Bourse. The company had been banking on a recovery in China following President Xi Jinping’s decision to reverse strict COVID-19 restrictions.

“We registered some pretty nice pick-up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, told a video conference. “So we’re really back to where we were prior to the complicated period of 2022.”

Only cosmetics remain “a little under pressure in mainland China,” he said, citing sustained interest in fashion, leather goods and jewelry especially.

Overall revenues in the fashion and leather goods division, headlined by its star mega-brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, rose 18 percent. Celine, Loewe, Loro Piana, Rimowa and Berluti also received shoutouts for “remarkable” performances.

Barclays had forecast 11 percent growth for the fashion and leather goods division, and HSBC a 15 percent bump in overall LVMH totals.

By region, Japan improved 34 percent in the quarter; Europe, 24 percent; Asia excluding Japan, 14 percent, and the U.S., 8 percent.

The company noted growth is “normalizing” in Europe versus 2022, while U.S. business was described as “good but softer.”

“LVMH is making the most of sustained European and American demand growth, while reaping the benefit of a rapid and strong rebound in Chinese spend,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a research note.

During the video conference, Guiony was quizzed mainly about prospects for China and the U.S., with the latter market sending off mixed signals in the first quarter. The executive noted a slowdown throughout the quarter for fashion, leather goods and jewelry, while acknowledging healthy business in watches, jewelry, cosmetics and Champagne. Its cognac business is also off in America, due partly to hefty price increases last year and high inventory levels.

“I’m not worried at all,” Guiony commented, noting that the “cognac business is cyclical in the U.S.” and dismissing suggestions that trendy tequila might be the culprit. “It will take three to four months to absorb the excess inventory.”

The executive reminded one analyst that back in September, everyone was expecting 2023 to be a “horrendous year” for luxury in the U.S., which has not come to pass so far. “It’s normalizing, but it’s not bad either,” he concluded. “It’s very difficult to make predictions.”

Asked about the impressive numbers in Japan, Guiony cited “a little bit of growth from tourists” and a “domestic consumer who is still shopping a lot,” confident about the economy and unworried about inflation.

He apologized for not offering a deeper and more thorough explanation, demurring: “I’d rather have good business that I can’t explain than the other way around. We really enjoy these exceptional numbers, which are a great tribute to the quality of the business that our people are doing in Japan.”

Revenues jumped 28 percent in organic terms in selective retailing, headlined by the “exceptional performance” of beauty chain Sephora, particularly in North America, Europe and the Middle East.

Sephora’s first store in London, located in the Westfield shopping center, opened last month and “enjoyed an excellent start,” LVMH said.

Meanwhile, duty-free operator DFS “benefited from the recovery of international travel, and in particular from the gradual return of travelers to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macau.” Guiony suggested the retailer could return to breakeven after a difficult 2022 marred by widespread pandemic-related lockdowns.

First-quarter intake from watches and jewelry grew 11 percent, with LVMH flagging a “very good performance” for high jewelry, “remarkable” progress for Chaumet, an “excellent” start of the year for Tiffany & Co., and “excellent progress” at its watchmaking maisons, which include Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith.

“Jewelry is doing a bit better than watches,” Guiony commented.

Perfumes and cosmetics logged a 10 percent improvement in organic revenue growth, with LVMH noting that “Fenty Beauty benefited from the strong visibility given to the brand by Rihanna during the Super Bowl.”

The singer whipped out a compact to touch up her makeup in the middle of her set, winning the Fenty brand strong visibility and online buzz.

“Makeup is doing well, but fragrances are doing even better and the skin care business if flattish,” he noted.

High stock levels of cognac held back revenue gains in the wines and spirits division to 3 percent, with LVMH touting good growth for its Champagne, wine, whiskey and vodka brands. Overall, Champagne and wines gained 14 percent, while cognac and spirits fell 5 percent.

”LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the start of the year,” the company said, providing no specific forecast other than to “further strengthen its global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023.”

The project was overseen by Alexadre Arnault, son of Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns several companies, including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. Bernard Arnault recently surpassed Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person with a net worth of $205 billion.

Tiffany was acquired by LVMH (LVMHF) in 2021 for $15.8 billion, making it one of the largest-ever sales in the luxury industry. While all of Arnault’s five children hold executive roles at his company, Alexandre, his second-eldest son, is currently Tiffany’s vice president of product and communications.

The jewelry company’s renovation “has been a passion project of mine over the past years,” said Alexandre, 30, in an Instagram post.

“It’s the biggest project for LVMH on the retail side,” he said at the flagship’s ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday (April 26), according to Bloomberg. “More than a store, it’s really a landmark—it’s an art gallery, it’s an exhibition space, it’s several restaurants, it’s a private club, it’s everything all at once that we’ve put under the same roof.”

Actress Gal Gadot presided over the ribbon cutting alongside Arnault and Anthony Ledru, Tiffany’s CEO. Located in Manhattan on the corner of 5th Avenue and East 57th Street, the building, which was built in the 1940s, closed down in 2019 to undergo years of renovations led by architect Peter Marino.

Tiffany has focused on rebranding under Alexandre Arnault

While LVMH hasn’t disclosed the total costs of the renovation, Ledru previously told Bloomberg that it constitutes the largest investment made by the conglomerate on a single store.

Before its renovation, the Tiffany building accounted for 10 percent of the jewelry brand’s global sales. Now, the new 110,000-square-foot space has 10 stories dedicated to various departments, including floors focused on engagement rings, gold and diamonds, and silver. Its decor includes Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1982 Equals Pi painting, in addition to works by Damien Hirst and Richard Prince.

The store also includes a Blue Box cafe run by Daniel Boulud and a room dedicated to Audrey Hepburn. “People relate a lot to her when it comes to Tiffany,” Alexandre told the New York Times, adding that he wasn’t nervous about delivering on the renovation, “because I’m surrounded by the best professionals we could have.”

Alexandre has spearheaded a number of initiatives since joining Tiffany’s, such as the “About Love” campaign featuring Jay-Z and Beyonce. He’s focused on collaborations with streetwear brands, including a partnership with Supreme inspired by pieces from the 1960s and a collaboration with Nike on a new Air Force 1 sneaker and series of accessories.

Alexandre also launched a campaign known as “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany,” in an attempt to attract younger customers to the 187-year-old brand.

In a January earnings call, Alexandre’s father Arnault said Tiffany has doubled its profit since it was acquired for more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), adding that the company would be worth twice as much if it were listed today.

Before coming to Tiffany’s, Alexandre was the CEO of luggage brand RIMOWA, owned by LVMH, and oversaw the company’s collaborations with Supreme, Off-White and Fendi.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999953508377075}",neutral,0.9999953508377075,0
"As LVMH Q1 Sales Rise 17%, China's Rebound Seeds Stellar Expectations For Luxury - Jing Daily","Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXExLXNhbGVzLWNoaW5hLXJlYm91bmQtbHV4dXJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With LVMH being the first luxury company to post global sales growth this week since the Chinese economy started to recoup from the COVID-induced paralysis of late 2022, it is already clear that 2023 should be a stunning year.

Expect record sales and profits for the industry overall, as well as bold creative and retail initiatives that will put many of the dire scenarios to rest. When China's luxury demand was hampered by lockdowns and a lack of consumer confidence last year, other nationalities saved the day. Now, as local consumption in the US and Europe could start to moderate in 2023, China's rebound as well as strong consumer trends in Japan, Southeast Asia and the Middle East should more than compensate.

The good news for 2023? Margins are unlikely to fall despite meaningful reinvestments as operating leverage from strong global sales, greater growth in Asia, and FX (foreign exchange) will all be very supportive. The better news for the long term? Luxury used to be a play for Japanese wealth 20 years ago and Chinese wealth pre-COVID; now it’s just a play for global wealth, whatever the nationality. Caution not warranted.

Earlier this week, LVMH published record Q1 sales on the back of Louis Vuitton, Dior, DFS and its other portfolio brands shooting the lights out. In my book Future Luxe, published in the midst of the COVID-19 panic in September 2020, I made 21 predictions for 2021 and beyond, including one that, in hindsight, is pretty obvious: “Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, will consistently top the list of the richest individuals in the world, ahead of Amazon’s Bezos. His group will hold 90 to 100 brands, up from 77 at the time of writing.”

Arnault is indeed the world’s wealthiest individual, currently ahead of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Whether this will stand or not remains to be seen, but what is clear is that growth of the overall luxury industry and LVMH in particular should be very healthy in 2023.

What carries Louis Vuitton, the biggest brand in luxury by sales and the one generating half of LVMH's profits? Bold collaborations such as the recent Yayoi Kusama project. Unexpected hires such as the appointment of ""Happy"" songwriter Pharrell Williams as the creative director of menswear, which both empowers diversity and reinforces the idea that luxury serves no purpose but to put a smile on one's face.

After their first drop in January 2023, Louis Vuitton and Yayoi Kusama returned in March to release part two of their polka-dotted collection.

And for just a few weeks now, having Pietro Beccari as CEO, a dreamer whose larger-than-life character will help scale the brand. Louis Vuitton was seen as ubiquitous when sales were €2bn, now it's not seen that way anymore despite the brand being 10 times bigger, thanks to the great work of Beccari’s predecessor. Hitting €30 billion in sales is not that farfetched.

Margins are unlikely to soar in 2023 as most brands are family controlled and take the long-term view, meaning they will almost always choose to feed brand equity and top-line growth for the long haul over margins in the short term. However, there are three reasons to believe that despite hefty reinvestments from sector heavyweights such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Hermès, Cartier, Chanel, Gucci and Tiffany, margins will still be supported in the short term.

First, Asia should outperform this year and brands enjoy higher profit margins there. Second, if the luxury sector grows in line with what LVMH put out in Q1 – 17 percent top-line growth – or even a bit below, which is possible given that Q1 had the toughest basis of comparison this year, there is bound to be some operating leverage from such strong growth. Third, but importantly, as most companies are hedging their FX exposure on a 12-month rolling basis, the decline of the EUR/USD from last summer and fall will benefit margins starting now (companies mostly produce in EUR but sell products across the globe).

Long term, the most powerful post-COVID reality is that luxury goods appeal to a global consumer. Although China's luxury sales were muted in 2022 due to country's strict pandemic policy, the year saw very solid growth as Americans and many local clienteles across the globe (French, Italian, Thai, South Korean, Japanese and many more) stepped up.

But in 2023, the luxury consumption of Americans, South Koreans and eventually Europeans will likely show signs of a slowdown. At the same time, most observers had underestimated the power of post-COVID rebounds in Europe and even more so in the US. China's recovery will likely more than mitigate weakness elsewhere while other nationalities in Asia contribute greatly. It is becoming clear that the luxury sector is driven by global wealth, not a single nationality, and that seems to be a lot healthier.

As LVMH likes to put it, Louis Vuitton does not sell handbags, it sells culture. That premise implies that the sky is the limit!

"LVMH Reduces Hong Kong Presence, Scales Up Footprint In Mainland China - Jing Daily","Tue, 25 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXJlZHVjZXMtaG9uZy1rb25nLXByZXNlbmNlLXNjYWxlcy11cC1mb290cHJpbnQtbWFpbmxhbmQtY2hpbmHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Once Asia’s leading international financial center, Hong Kong is losing out to Shanghai and Singapore.

According to Bloomberg , luxury conglomerate LVMH has moved the regional headquarters of some of its brands, as well as the group’s local head office, from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The move included the relocation of some senior executives to the mainland.

The number of foreign companies setting up regional headquarters and offices in Hong Kong declined for a third consecutive year in 2022, reports Nikkei Asia . Between 2018 and 2022, Hong Kong only welcomed an average of 950 companies each year – Singapore registered 18,000 new companies over the same period – compared to the 42,000 companies opening an office in the SAR in 2017 alone.

The Jing Take

LVMH’s move reflects the company’s plan to focus on investing in China’s first-tier cities, such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, as consumers switch to shopping domestically.

In its first quarter 2023 earnings report , LVMH stated that Chinese tourists’ offshore consumption is growing faster than domestic consumption, but in terms of overall consumption, local spending is still four to five times higher than offshore tourism. This shows a shift in consumption habits — homegrown consumers are increasingly willing to buy luxury goods in Mainland China.

The shrinking price differential between the Mainland and Hong Kong for goods, the expansion of brands’ brick-and-mortar footprints across China, and upgrades to in-store experiences have also accelerated domestic sales growth.

For instance, Louis Vuitton’s Neverfull handbag in large sells for 2,200 (15,200 RMB) in China, while in Hong Kong it is priced at 20,100 (14,500 RMB), a difference of 100 (700 RMB). As this price gap shrinks, so too does Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a shopping mecca.

In light of these trends, luxury brands are concentrating their efforts in Mainland China. In recent years, brands have increased their footprint in new areas in the mainland and opened flagship stores in new first-tier cities, such as Chengdu and Nanjing. The aim? To reach a broader spectrum of shoppers and establish long-term customer relationships facilitated by proximity.

As China becomes an increasingly important market for luxury brands, more relocations are inevitable. Only by operating in the same environment as their customers can luxury brands keep up with this dynamic country’s pace.

Along the way, Arnault has brought his five adult children into the fold, building a family-run business that has resulted in the world’s largest fortune.

Arnault, the 74-year-old chairman of LVMH , has built his fortune over the span of almost four decades, amassing a luxury-goods empire that includes some of the best-known names in fashion, jewellery and alcohol, including Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer and Dom Pérignon.

When it comes to the world of luxury goods, perhaps no one is more successful than Bernard Arnault.

Here’s how Arnault got his start and became the richest person in the world.

Bernard Arnault studied engineering

Arnault comes from the northern French town of Roubaix. He studied engineering at one of France’s most prestigious schools, the École Polytechnique. After graduating, Arnault went to work for his father’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel.

He acquired an ailing company in 1984

In 1984, Arnault acquired an ailing company called Agache-Willot-Boussac, which owned brands like French department store Bon Marché and the fashion house Christian Dior. He renamed the firm Financière Agache and initiated a turnaround, cutting costs and selling some of its businesses. Soon after, he bought fashion house Celine and funded the French designer Christian Lacroix.

He defined his goal to run the world’s largest luxury company in the late 1980s

He then set his sights on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, spending US$2.6 billion buying up shares to become the company’s largest shareholder, and eventually its chairman and CEO, by 1989.

His first marriage and family

Arnault married Anne Dewavrin in 1973, and they had two children together before separating in 1990. Arnault remarried in 1991, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist. He reportedly wooed her by playing Chopin and other classical composers.

He lives a lavish life

He travels by private jet, owns a sprawling holiday villa in glitzy Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera and reportedly has also spent at least US$96.4 million on residential properties in the Los Angeles area: in Beverly Hills, the Trousdale Estates and Hollywood Hills neighbourhoods.

He’s an avid art collector

In 2017, Arnault met then-president-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, right before Trump’s inauguration, to discuss expanding LVMH factories in the US. The company opened a new 100,000 sq ft Louis Vuitton factory in Texas in 2019, the company’s third factory in the US.

Arnault considered the legendary designer and Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld a good friend. “The death of this dear friend deeply saddens me, my wife and my children,” Arnault said in a statement upon Lagerfeld’s death in 2019. “We loved and admired him deeply. Fashion and culture has lost a great inspiration.”

His long-standing public rivalry with François Pinault, the founder of luxury group Kering

Worth about US$37 billion, François Pinault’s company Kering owns brands like Gucci and Yves St Laurent as well as Christie’s auction house. LVMH originally tried to acquire a majority stake in Gucci in 1999 but Pinault ultimately snatched up the brand.

He has built LVMH into the biggest luxury conglomerate in the world

Arnault has earned himself an imposing nickname: “the wolf in the cashmere coat”. He’s behind the creation of Foundation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum and performance space in Paris that opened in 2014.

In April 2019, LVMH released a statement on behalf of the Arnault family, pledging €200 million, or about US$218.8 million, to help rebuild the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was heavily damaged in a 2019 fire.

In October 2020, Arnault’s company bought Tiffany & Co. for US$15.8 billion in the luxury sector’s biggest-ever deal. The contentious sale involved multiple lawsuits and a US$400 million price drop.

Not always smooth sailing

When it comes to finances, the past few years have been a roller-coaster ride for Arnault and LVMH. In January 2019, Arnault made US$4.3 billion in a single day after LVMH shares surged 6.9 per cent. And just six months later, on June 19, 2019, Arnault again made news when he became the third person in the world to reach a US$100 billion net worth.

Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and pandemic-related shutdowns sank LVMH’s stock, sending Arnault’s personal net worth down more than US$30 billion by May 2020.

But as the world opened up again, LVMH’s stock recovered, thanks to strong sales in fashion and leather goods and an uptick in alcohol sales, particularly champagne. It’s been a good year so far for the company: it recorded €36.7 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022, up 28 per cent from the same period in 2021.

He’s the world’s richest person with a net worth of US$212 billion

His wealth has grown by US$33.7 billion so far this year. Arnault’s net worth surpassed the US$200 billion mark earlier this month, making him the third-person ever, behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, to do so.

Arnault reportedly meets with his five children for a monthly lunch in the private dining room at LVMH to instruct them on the company’s strategy and manager performance, The Wall Street Journal reported.

But Sidney Toledano, CEO of LVMH’s fashion arm, told The Journal that it’s not guaranteed that one of Arnault’s children will succeed him as CEO of LVMH.

How Vulnerable Is LVMH? | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2hvdy12dWxuZXJhYmxlLWlzLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Thursday, shares in LVMH rose 5 percent to a record market valuation of €432 billion after the luxury conglomerate reported better-than-expected quarterly sales.

Also Thursday: scores of protesters rallying against the French government’s plans to raise the retirement age flooded LVMH’s Paris headquarters. The incursion lasted just a few minutes, but images of the striking workers brandishing red flares and chanting in the lobby of luxury’s biggest group, controlled by the world’s wealthiest person, Bernard Arnault, circulated worldwide.

The dual narratives were typical of luxury’s last year. On the one hand, rebounding travel and events, a tight labour market and big cushions in the budgets of the wealthy have helped many luxury brands keep beating expectations, quarter after quarter.

But there’s always a reminder that the good times might not last: rising interest rates, sinking consumer confidence, and the abrupt collapse of the post-pandemic stock market rally last year have put the industry’s growth streak in question. Then there are the shocks to the system, from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to China’s tightening — then reversal — of Zero Covid policies. And now, French protests.

Markets don’t seem too concerned. Shares across the sector rallied in recent weeks as several investment banks upgraded their forecasts for the industry’s growth, judging that a slowdown in the US will be manageable and possibly short-lived.

LVMH’s first-quarter revenues for fashion and leather rose 18 percent — comforting hopes of a rapid coronavirus rebound in China. Package tours, which were previously the main driver of sales to Chinese customers, have yet to rebound, but LVMH said China’s domestic market is already back to its 2021 peak and high-spending individual Chinese travellers are popping back up in international shopping hubs. Management commentary also reassured investors regarding continued growth in Europe and strategies for managing a slowdown in the US.

Earlier this month, Arnault’s fortune climbed above $200 billion for the first time amid global news coverage of France’s nationwide strikes and rallies sparked by president Emmanuel Macron’s plan to raise the retirement age, which the government has pushed ahead despite popular and parliamentary opposition.

Images of protestors clashing with police, fires on the street and heaps of trash on sidewalks due to a garbage strike might be seen as a blow for French luxury houses — many of whom trade on an idealised vision of Paris, and operate their most profitable flagship stores in the tourist hub. But French luxury companies are well practised in selling the dream while navigating messy realities.

The runaway success of Emily in Paris, Netflix’s campy and romanticised romp through the city, is a case in point for just how well established “Brand France” is, and how adept it is at shaking off dents to its image, like the destructive Yellow Vest protests in 2018 and 2019 just before the show was released.

Despite living in the eye of the storm of the current political crisis, sales to local French customers are currently growing by double-digits, LVMH said. (Outside the scheduled, police-supervised mayhem of demonstrations, life is mostly plodding ahead as usual in France, with most people working, eating, partying — and shopping—as they normally would.)

As for the protests at LVMH, an organiser stressed that the intervention on the margin of Thursday’s nationwide strike was “peaceful and symbolic.” Forcing their way into the company’s offices (as French protestors have done at other companies and banks including BlackRock in recent weeks) is a way for activists to illustrate “the fact that capitalism is neither fluid nor consensual, but is imposed by force,” political commentator Pablo Pillaud-Vivien explained.

Still, the incident was enough to spark questions about public opinion of LVMH and Arnault, who are seen abroad as untouchable champions of French industry.

As France’s (and the world’s) richest man, Arnault and his company are certainly potent symbols of rising inequality. In recent years, discourse has ramped up in France (as in the US) regarding raising taxes on billionaires for projects including fighting climate change, funding pensions and more.

But many French people’s opinions toward Arnault and his company seem to have softened in recent years. Where LVMH used to take a standoffish approach to corporate communications — preferring to hide behind its brands — it’s taken steps to burnish its public profile in recent years: promoting recruitment drives (highlighting job creation), staging open houses for its ateliers (establishing a reputation for protecting craftsmanship) — as well as sponsoring art exhibitions, start-up incubators and training programmes. The company regularly points out that it is the country’s highest taxpayer, paying out over €5 billion in French taxes and social charges last year, as well as employing over 40,000 people in the country.

While LVMH isn’t universally adored, it is broadly respected. Efforts by the group’s brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior to become more culturally relevant, particularly among young consumers, hardly hurt: Today, for every social media post and protest placard denouncing the mega-rich, there are just as many venerating their lifestyle and offering tips for how to attain it. Plenty of French people are proud that Europe’s biggest company, and the world’s richest person, are French.

Should the winds of policy ever really swing against rising inequality, LVMH will, of course, be a prime target no matter how many times they’ve opened their ateliers. But the days feel like a distant memory when, in 2011, a leading French newspaper put Arnault on its cover with the phrase “Casse toi, riche con” (politely translated as “Get lost, rich jerk”) or when François Ruffin made a national hit with his 2015 documentary “Merci, Patron!” (“Thank, Boss!”) — a political satire that featured hidden-camera footage of LVMH fixers attempting to buy off a disgruntled former worker and pressuring left-wing activists.

For now, it seems farfetched that Macron would reverse his stance on retirement reforms in favour of boosting taxes on companies and the rich. A recent push for higher taxes on the “superprofits” of some energy companies — referring to their commodity price-fuelled boom since the war in Ukraine — failed to gain traction in parliament.

Still, France’s political crisis could have negative effects long-term. Discontent with Macron has been adding fuel to the fire of protest parties like Marine Le Pen’s right wing National Rally, whose statist policies may be less friendly to big luxury. But investors seem confident in LVMH’s ability to cross that bridge if they get there: shares didn’t dip in response to the protests Thursday, and continued to rise to a record Friday morning.

Just a day after the protest, LVMH is forging ahead with plans to host a concert by Jay-Z, sponsored by Tiffany & Co., at its art foundation outside Paris Friday night. (An LVMH source underscored that it was not a private concert — the event was open to members of the public who managed to nab tickets online). LVMH seems confident, too, in its ability to keep navigating a divided world.

LVMH Value Tops $500 Billion in 1st for Europe - PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9sdm1oLW1hcmtldC12YWx1ZS10b3BzLTUwMC1iaWxsaW9uLWluLTFzdC1mb3ItZXVyb3BlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury retailer LVMH’s market value has surpassed $500 billion in a first for European firms.

The milestone, observed Monday (April 24) in multiple media accounts, comes weeks after the company reported a leap in sales driven by shoppers in China.

The company — owner of Louis Vuitton, Hennessy and Sephora — said April 12 that its sales had jumped 17% during its first quarter, thanks in part to the lifting of its pandemic restrictions in China, the world’s third largest luxury market.

In remarks during an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said LVMH was “extremely optimistic” about its prospects in China during 2023, adding that its first-quarter earnings “bode well for the rest of the year.”

Guiony’s bullishness echoed sentiments expressed in January by LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, now the world’s richest person.

“We have every reason to be confident — indeed optimistic — on the Chinese market,” Arnault said. “In Macau, where the Chinese can now travel to, the change is quite spectacular. The stores are full and it’s really come back at a very strong pace.”

LVMH in January saw its market value reach $430 billion, cementing the company’s status as the most valuable in Europe.

The company and other luxury brands have continued to enjoy strong sales recently in spite of inflation. For example, Italian luxury group Brunello Cucinelli, known for its cashmere apparel, reported a 33% increase in sales last week.

As noted here, this increase was chiefly attributed to performance in the Americas and a resumption of sales in Asia, an indication of the rise of the “quiet luxury” trend.

PYMNTS also recently looked at the trend of luxury brands promoting exclusivity to drive sales, with companies like Saks and Gucci offering programs catering to their wealthiest customers.

Saks announced last week it was expanding its exclusive top-client program, Saks Limitless, which offers members access to luxury fashion via a range of unique services and benefits.

Gucci, meanwhile, recently opened the Gucci Salon, a store in Los Angeles catering only to its VIP clients and A-list celebrities.

“While luxury items are not exempt from inflation, wealthy consumers are less affected by price increases, so by targeting that demographic Gucci and Saks can maintain sales,” PYMNTS wrote. “With the Gucci Salon and Saks Limitless, both brands have an opportunity to cater to big-spending clients and A-list celebrities who can afford high-end products, while offering exclusive and customized experiences that appeal to them.”

Drinks division weakest performer in LVMH first quarter sales - The Drinks Business,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0L2RyaW5rcy1kaXZpc2lvbi13ZWFrZXN0LXBlcmZvcm1lci1pbi1sdm1oLWZpcnN0LXF1YXJ0ZXItc2FsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Ron Emler

On the face of it, LVMH sales in the first three months of 2023 herald a return of the good times. Yet of all the luxury company’s interests, its drinks arm Moët Hennessy showed the least impressive results.

The rise of 17% in organic revenue to €21 billion compared with the same period a year ago was double analysts’ expectations and shares in Europe’s most valuable company jumped to a record high.

Little wonder that chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault hailed the figures as “an excellent start to the year.”

LVMH shares have doubled in value in the past three years, propelling Arnault, who owns approximately half of the group, into the unchallenged top spot as the world’s richest man, worth some US$200 billion.

Key to the spectacular results was Asia where sales grew by 14% compared with a fall of 8% in the final three months of 2022, when China remained under anti-Covid restrictions.

While LVMH declined to provide a breakdown on its results in the People’s Republic (but was keen to highlight that Japan was up 34%) , there is little doubt that it was a prime driver in the quarter given that China accounts for about 80% of LVMH’s activity in Asia.

“We’re definitely out of the zero-Covid period now. The page has turned,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told the Financial Times. “We expect this to continue, and we are very optimistic about the normalisation of the Chinese market.”

The group said it expected China to drive growth in the rest of 2023.

The lion’s share of the global sales growth came from fashion and leather goods, the company’s largest division, and retailing where the DFS duty-free empire benefited from the continuing recovery in global travel.

Weakest performer

However, the drinks division, Moët Hennessy, was the weakest performer, where sales improved by just 3% over the first three months of this year compared with last.

Further premiumisation of the Champagne marques pushed revenues ahead by 14%, but Hennessy Cognac and other spirits saw sales fall by 5% over the same period.

LVMH said that Cognac volumes were down due to the “softer” US economic environment and high inventory levels.

LVMH total sales in the US grew by 8% in the quarter, more than analysts had expected, but Guiony said most of that growth was down to its less exclusive Sephora retail chain of beauty stores rather than people rushing out to buy fizz.

“For the rest, the business is slowing down a bit,” he said, confirming suspicions that resistance to price rises is becoming a factor in the US economy. “Maybe interest rate rises are taking their toll on spending,”

That is significant as a string of drinks group chief executives have gone out on a limb recently to insist that they had yet to experience any noticeable trading down in the face of aggressive price rises imposed on the consumer to protect margins.

Earlier this month Bill Newlands, chief executive of Constellation Brands, noted that demand for the company’s “mainstream brands” [largely beers] has been lower but “nevertheless consumers are seeking more premium-priced products”.

So Moet Hennessy’s numbers are troublesome because not only do the LVMH comments point to a deceleration in US spirit sales growth but there are other signs that the post-covid spending spree is beginning to slow.

Credit card data from giant US bank Citi showed that luxury spending in March fell to the lowest monthly rate in nearly three years, down 18% as fewer people splashed out on high-end goods.

Younger shoppers, who drew on savings during lockdowns, are now under more pressure from rising prices than older generations with higher incomes, Citi analysts said.

For premium drinks companies, that is a concern. The US is their largest single market and the most profitable.

For instance, it comprised 37% of Diageo’s net sales in the six months to last Christmas and 28% of Pernod Ricard’s.

When it reports figures later this month, no doubt Rémy Cointreau will reflect the upturn in China, where it leads the market for premium imported spirits through its Rémy Martin stable of Cognacs.

At the same time, however, analysts will look closely at its trading in North America and its predictions for the remainder of this year. Signs of sluggishness will impact on sentiment to the whole spirits sector.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997876286506653}",positive,0.9997876286506653,1

His net worth gained US$2.4 billion on Tuesday, bringing the Frenchman’s fortune to US$201 billion, per Bloomberg’s index.

Arnault’s net worth climbed over the US$200 billion mark on Tuesday, making him the third person ever – after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos – to attain that level of wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Arnault is also the first person outside the US to surpass a net worth of US$200 billion.

Bernard Arnault – the CEO and co-founder of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Vuitton and the richest person in the world – has reached another milestone on his wealth journey.

LVMH shares on the Euronext Paris stock exchange closed 0.8 per cent higher at 851 euros, or US$932.30, on Tuesday. The stock is up about 25 per cent this year.

A luxury boom is propping up Bernard Arnault’s wealth

The French tycoon’s net worth has doubled since the beginning of 2020 amid strong demand for luxury goods as consumers splurged on designer handbags and watches during pandemic lockdowns.

This robust appetite for luxury goods is helping LVMH, which owns a range of luxury fashion brands including leather goods maker Louis Vuitton, jeweller Tiffany & Co., and watchmaker Tag Heuer. LVMH posted a 23 per cent year-on-year growth in revenues as well as profits from recurring operations in 2022, according to the company’s financials.

Millennials and Gen Z are also driving growth in this market. A record number of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 are opting to live at home with their parents – at a level not seen since the Great Depression – thus freeing up disposable income for splashing out on luxury goods.

LVMH is also making a targeted move to win over customers in Asia.

Shoppers in China are expected to boost the luxury goods sector this year after the country lifted its zero Covid restrictions. Chinese consumers are expected to boost demand for high-end apparel, accessories, and other items by 20 per cent in 2023, according to a Morgan Stanley report on March 13.

To reach younger shoppers, particularly in Northeast Asia, LVMH has been making a calculated move to enlist K-pop stars for their luxury marketing campaigns across various brands from Dior to Tiffany.

Arnault has kept the management of his business empire in the family

Arnault has managed to keep much of the management of his business empire in the family, appointing all five of his children into leadership positions across the conglomerate’s various luxury brands.

In July 2022, Arnault changed the legal structure of his family holding company Agache – the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior – to ensure his family’s control over LVMH in the long term.

The 73-year-old tycoon has not announced who will succeed him as LVMH CEO. His only daughter Delphine Arnault heads the key fashion brand Dior, while his older son Antoine Arnault is the CEO of LVMH’s holding company Christian Dior.

The French design house reportedly surpassed Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG in market value earlier this week and now stands as the eighth most valuable company across Europe, in addition to placing second behind fashion conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF) in the luxury market.

“In 2022, Hermès had an exceptional year thanks notably to the good performance of its international markets,” said CEO Axel Dumas, a descendant of founder Thierry Hermès who has led the company since 2014, in a statement accompanying its annual results.

Before joining Hermès as an auditor in 2003 and eventually holding positions as head of the company’s jewelry and leather goods divisions, Dumas worked as an investment banker for Paribas in Beijing, Paris and New York City.

LVMH, the parent company of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Fendi, is valued at around $458 billion, while its CEO Bernard Arnault is currently the world’s richest person with an estimated net worth of $194 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Hermès and LVMH have long been rivals, with Arnault acquiring 23 percent of Hermès shares by 2013 and prompting Dumas to convince his family members to pool their shares in a holding company. LVMH later agreed to relinquish the majority of its stakes, quelling concerns of a takeover bid.

Hermès, known for its leather handbags such as the sought-after Birkin bag, which ranges from $8,500 to $300,000, saw revenue increase by 29 percent in 2022 with around 11.6 billion euros ($12.6 billion) worth of sales, a record for the company, with all employees receiving an “exceptional bonus” of 4,000 euro ($4,360).

Why has Hermès seen such significant growth?

Much of the company’s recent growth is attributed to a rebound in demand for luxury goods in China after a series of pandemic-related lockdowns. In 2022, Hermès saw sales grow by 22 percent in Asia, excluding Japan.

“We have seen a strong situation in China with big progression, double digit growth over the last two years,” said Dumas during a February presentation of the company’s 2022 results. “We see this momentum and the attractiveness that Hermès represents.”

The luxury design house has also seen increasing demand for its products and has reportedly doubled its sales over the past decade despite operating from around the same amount of stores.

Hermès plans to increase its leather output by 7 percent through a newly opened leather goods facility in Normandy, France. The company also said it hopes to add one new facility annually, with workshops set to open in the French cities Sormonne and Riom by the end of 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9923560619354248}",neutral,0.9923560619354248,0

""It's nothing to write home about but, nevertheless, what we’ve seen both in jewellery and in fashion and leather is a little bit of a slowdown throughout the quarter. It’s difficult to draw any perspective for the rest of the year. For the time being, it’s perfectly manageable and we still keep a good level of business.” LVMH’s beauty retailer Sephora is a standout in the region, Guiony said, and is doing “extremely well” in the US.

Watches and jewellery rose 11 per cent, also above consensus at 6.9 per cent. Tiffany & Co. is to reopen its iconic flagship later this month, which prior to its closing contributed 10 per cent of the brand’s global sales. Guiony said: “I don’t think we will increase the business by 10 per cent just by clicking our fingers and reopening the store on Fifth Avenue. But this being said, it should have a positive impact, not only in terms of numbers — it’s also very important in terms of marketing and branding because it’s a testimony of what we are doing with the brand.”

Top of mind for Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s largest fashion house, is the men’s business. The brand announced in February that Pharrell Williams had been appointed as its men’s creative director, putting an end to the speculation around who would take over the role. “I think the nomination of Pharrell is actually telling you something about the blurring of boundaries between distribution, marketing and product strategies,” said Guiony. “This is true for most of our brands.

The sale of the 5,000 square foot property represents the largest ever price per square foot commercial real estate transaction in the Hamptons, Suffolk County or Nassau County, according to Daniel Abbondandolo, an investment broker at Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate firm which worked on the sale.

“LVMH saw it as an opportunity to create a flagship store,” he said, adding that the transaction took around 90 days.

Located at 1 Main Street, the building is priced at $4,400 per square foot, while the average cost of a square foot in an East Hampton’s commercial property is $1,348, as reported by the East Hampton Star.

The luxury conglomerate, which owns a number of companies including Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Moet, is valued at $458 billion, making it the world’s most valuable luxury company. In December, its founder and CEO Arnault, who currently has an estimated net worth of $198 billion, surpassed Elon Musk to become the world’s wealthiest person.

Earlier this month, Arnault’s net worth briefly exceeded $200 billion, a mark which only previously been met by Musk and Jeff Bezos.

Why did Arnault purchase a Hamptons property?

LVMH’s new East Hampton property will likely be used as a store for Louis Vuitton, according to Jeremy Tahari, who previously co-owned the building alongside his father Elie Tahari, a fashion designer with an eponymous clothing line who purchased the property in 2006 for $7.5 million to open a store for his brand.

In the past two years, jewelry company Cartier has leased the space for a pop-up showroom. The two-story building, which was built in 1917, has also been used as a post office and grocery store over the years.

The property is “the best piece of real estate in the Hamptons,” said Jeremy Tahari. “It’s a grandiose facade and it sits on the corner of Newtown Lane and Montauk Highway, it’s the most trafficked street in all of the Hamptons.”

LVMH and Robin Zendell & Associates, a real estate firm representing the luxury company in the transaction, did not respond to requests for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999991774559021}",neutral,0.999991774559021,0

Rival Hermès International S.A. subsequently published its own strong numbers, reinforcing the view that China’s reopening from pandemic lockdowns is fuelling growth across the industry.

LVMH’s market value surpassed US$500 billion, becoming the first European company to reach that milestone thanks to booming sales of luxury goods in China and a strengthening euro.

The company’s rising value has swelled the wealth of the world’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, who built LVMH into a global powerhouse through a series of acquisitions. His fortune stands at almost US$212 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Shares of Paris-based LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, as the company is formally known, climbed 0.3 per cent to €903.70 at 10:43am. Monday, valuing the company at €454 billion (US$500 billion).

LVMH and its French luxury rivals are to the European stock market what Big Tech has been to the US: dominant businesses whose growth holds up even as the economy waxes and wanes. That’s evident in the global market value rankings, with a host of technology companies dominating the list, where LVMH has become the latest entrant taking 10th place.

“Luxury stocks embody what the equity market has best to offer at the moment: exposure to Chinese consumption, which continues to surprise on the rise and robust margins thanks to their pricing power,” said Lilia Peytavin, European portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs in Paris. “This differentiates luxury from tech, whose margins have been contracting for several quarters already.”

Demand has held up for LVMH products – Louis Vuitton handbags , Moët & Chandon champagne and Christian Dior gowns among them – even as surging inflation and rising interest rates have threatened to tip the world into recession.

LVMH did caution this month that it’s seeing a slowdown in US growth, with demand for cognac and leather goods particularly affected, and some investors fret that the stock inevitably will be hurt should the economic slowdown worsen.

For now, paradoxically, concern about a recession is lifting LVMH’s value in dollar terms. The euro this month jumped to its highest level in more than a year as the dollar slumped, fuelled by increasing market expectations that a worsening US economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.

Analysts have been raising their targets on LVMH’s stock amid the steep run higher. They see room for further gains, as 30 out of the 36 analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a buy-equivalent rating.

Bank of America Corp.’s Ashley Wallace sees the stock hitting €1,000 in the next year, a relatively huge jump from its current price at €903.70. “LVMH is too cheap given the attractiveness of the luxury goods sector, its strong portfolio of brands and best-in-class execution,” Wallace wrote in a report April 13.

The US$500 billion milestone was decades in the making

Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive officer, made his foray into luxury in 1984, taking over Boussac Saint-Freres, the bankrupt textile group that owned a gem: Christian Dior. He spun off most of the company’s other businesses and used the windfall to buy a controlling stake in LVMH, whose two main companies, Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, had merged in 1987.

Over the next three decades – and through dozens of acquisitions – he built LVMH into a luxury behemoth, selling everything from spirits to leather goods to jewellery through more than 5,600 stores worldwide. He was quick to grasp that China would become a key market, opening the first Louis Vuitton store in Beijing in 1992.

Arnault, 74, and his family own 48 per cent of LVMH’s share capital, and he’s been laying the groundwork to keep the company under family control for decades to come.

Training ground for ambitious designers

The sprawling conglomerate, with its 75 labels ranging from Dom Perignon to Givenchy and Tiffany & Co., became a training ground for ambitious designers seeking to make a name for themselves: Marc Jacobs and the late Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton, Raf Simons at Christian Dior and Phoebe Philo at Celine. All infused the brands with novelty that kept them relevant to young consumers.

In February, Louis Vuitton named musician and apparel entrepreneur Pharrell Williams as the label’s menswear designer, filling the role previously held by Abloh, who died in 2021. Williams will unveil his first collection in June during Paris Fashion Week.

French resentment

The strong performance of LVMH has propelled his fortune higher, making him the world’s wealthiest person, ahead of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

But it’s also prompted resentment in his home country. On April 13, protesters briefly stormed the headquarters of LVMH on the posh Avenue Montaigne. Union members voiced their anger against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to raise the minimum retirement age, urging that any shortfall in the pension system should be made up by increasing taxes on businesses like the luxury behemoth.

There’s no sign Arnault intends to step down any time soon. LVMH last year lifted the age limit of its chief executive officer, which would allow him to stay at the helm until 80. The titan has started to lay the groundwork for his succession, though, through a new holding company.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996873140335083}",positive,0.9996873140335083,1

A retail property in East Hampton has sold for $22 million.

LVMH, the Paris-based luxury-brand conglomerate, purchased the two-story, 5,000-square-foot building on .06 acres at 1 Main St.

The sale price equates to $4,400 per square foot, one of the highest per-square-foot prices ever paid for retail property on Long Island.

The property is currently leased to Cartier.

LVMH is the publicly traded parent company of many luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Fendi, Christian Dior, Bulgari and many more.

Andrew Goldberg of CBRE represented the buyer, while Jordan Sutton, Robert Shapiro, Dan Abbondandolo and Victor Little of Cushman & Wakefield represented the sellers, Elie and Jeremey Tahari, in the sales transaction.

“We are thrilled to have arranged the sale of 1 Main Street, one of the most iconic retail assets in East Hampton,” Sutton said in a company statement. “Luxury brands such as LVMH have embraced the East End of Long Island, not just on a seasonal basis but a full-time lifestyle.”

Abbondandolo added that the transaction defines the strength of East Hampton’s downtown retail.

“Retail pockets such as Main Street have become a critical component to high-end retailers’ marketing and brand recognition,” Abbondandolo said in the statement.

Seller Jeremey Tahari of Tahari Capital said he is “aggressively pursuing multifamily opportunities in this market. Please reach out to me directly with any new opportunities.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999371767044067}",neutral,0.9999371767044067,0

Delphine became CEO of Dior in January, while Frédéric was named CEO of Tag Heuer aged just 25.

LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest person, just saw his wealth surpass US$200 billion . His family seem to be joining in on the ride as each kid has already secured a high-up position in the company.

There are Hollywood nepo babies ... and then there are billionaire nepo babies.

Here’s what to know about the world’s current richest person and his potential successors at the fashion conglomerate.

Bernard Arnault is the world’s richest person

Bernard Arnault is currently the world’s richest person with a net worth of about US$201 billion, according to estimates by Bloomberg. He’s only the third person to surpass the US$200 billion mark following tech moguls Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, both of whom have since seen their wealth fall

Bernard co-founded LVMH in the 1980s, and is its CEO and chair. The French luxury conglomerate owns a range of brands covering fashion, perfume, jewellery, watches, and alcohol including Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Moët & Chandon, Fenty Beauty and Tiffany & Co.

In February, Bernard’s daughter Delphine became CEO of Dior. But it’s not just Delphine who’s risen up LVMH’s ranks. All four of Bernard’s sons work at LVMH and its brands, too.

“Succession planning in strategic roles has been instrumental to the success of LVMH’s key brands over the past 20 years,” Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said, per Reuters.

Bernard, 74, has not said who he wants to take over from him, but it’s a topic that gets discussed every time he gives one of his offspring a new role. Last year LVMH raised the age limit of its CEO from 75 to 80, extending Bernard’s possible tenure.

Delphine, born in 1975, is the eldest of Bernard’s five children , and his only daughter.

She started her career at McKinsey, where she spent two years as a consultant before moving to designer John Galliano’s company.

Delphine worked at Christian Dior Couture as its deputy managing director from 2008 to 2013, before spending a decade as an executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s biggest brand.

The 48-year-old started as the CEO and chair of Dior on February 1.

Delphine sits on LVMH’s board of directors and is a member of its executive committee – only the second woman to join it, and its youngest member when she joined it at 43.

Antoine Arnault is the CEO of LVMH’s parent company. Antoine is Bernard’s oldest son, born in 1977. Like Delphine, Antoine was born to Bernard’s first wife, Anne Dewavrin.

Antoine started working at LVMH in 2005 in its advertising department. Just two years later, he was appointed director of communications at Louis Vuitton, where he launched campaigns with public figures ranging from Angelina Jolie and Bono to Muhammad Ali and Mikhail Gorbachev.

In December, Antoine was appointed CEO of Christian Dior SE , the holding company the family uses to control LVMH. The 45-year-old is also the CEO of shoemaker Berluti and non-executive chair of cashmere label Loro Piana.

Antoine became a board member at LVMH in 2006 and has been the company’s head of image and environment since 2018.

Alexandre was born in 1992, Bernard’s first son to his second wife, Helene Mercier, and is an executive vice-president at Tiffany & Co

After interning in New York at McKinsey and KKR, Alexandre moved to his father’s retail empire, where he worked on digital innovation.

“I was obviously raised to be in the group,” Alexandre told The New York Times in 2018, adding that it was ultimately his choice to work at LVMH and that he turned down offers from McKinsey and KKR.

Alexandre spent about four years as the CEO of German luggage brand Rimowa after reportedly persuading his father to buy an 80 per cent stake in it in 2016. During his time at the helm, he revitalised Rimowa – including launching collaborations with Supreme and Off-White.

After LVMH bought Tiffany & Co. for US$15.8 billion in 2020, Alexandre became executive vice-president of product and communications at the jewellery maker at just 28 years of age.

Former president Donald Trump said in February that he had hosted Alexandre and his wife for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. “He is a young man on the move, the son of one of the great businessmen and leaders in Europe, and in the world,” Trump wrote of 30-year-old Alexandre.

4. Frédéric Arnault, CEO of Tag Heuer

After interning at Facebook and McKinsey, and a brief period running a mobile payment start-up, Frédéric quickly moved up the ranks at LVMH.

He joined the company full-time in 2017 as the temporary head of connected technologies at the Swiss watchmaker. Just a year later, he became Tag’s director of strategy and digital. In 2020, he was named the brand’s CEO at the age of 25.

The New York Times reported that the elder Arnault had groomed Frédéric to become Tag Heuer’s leader from the start, though this wasn’t entirely smooth sailing.

Stéphane Bianchi, who was CEO of Tag before Frédéric and tasked with training his successor, told the newspaper they clashed “everywhere” at the start.

In his time running the company, Frédéric, 28, has focused on connected watches, orchestrated a shift from wholesale to retail and grown its e-commerce sales, and negotiated a partnership with Porsche.

5. Jean Arnault, director of Louis Vuitton’s watches division

Jean Arnault is Bernard’s youngest son and joined LVMH after graduating. He has a master’s in financial mathematics from MIT and another in mechanical engineering from Imperial College, London, according to the Financial Times.

As a student, he interned at both Morgan Stanley and McLaren Racing and had a short stint at a Louis Vuitton retail store in Paris, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Jean became marketing and development director of Louis Vuitton’s watch division in August 2021 at the age of 23, just months after he graduated. He’s now the brand’s watches director.

Jean told the FT that his older brother Frédéric’s work at Tag Heuer had sparked his interest in watchmaking.

“We have a close relationship and he started talking to me about the new watches and all the different things he was working on,” Jean said. “I was fascinated. And that’s really the turning point.”

Jean told The New York Times in November that he still turns to Frédéric for work advice.

Louis Vuitton to build new flagship as luxury retail booms in NYC - New York Post,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzI3L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy1kb3VibGUtZG93bi1vbi1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcmV0YWlsL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzI3L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy1kb3VibGUtZG93bi1vbi1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcmV0YWlsL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The opening of the new Tiffany flagship this month at 727 Fifth Ave., and the upcoming new Rolex tower at 645 Fifth Ave., are part of a Manhattan retail revival.

Leading the way, LVMH is planning an entirely new building for the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street, which will become a glamorous new Louis Vuitton flagship.

Multiple sources tell The Post that LVMH has been hosting a “beauty contest” and interviewing “starchitects” to figure out who will design the next generation flagship offices and retail store for Louis Vuitton.

That’s one reason it signed a seven-year lease with Donald Trump to lease the 65,000-square-foot former Nike spot at 6 E. 57th St., which its own Tiffany’s brand is vacating right now as it moves back into its redeveloped flagship at The Landmark at 727 Fifth Ave.

LVMH intends to completely demolish both Louis Vuitton’s current and narrow 19-story structure, once home to the loopy Warner Bros. store, along with the smaller adjacent building to the north at 743 Fifth Ave., now occupied by its watch brand, Hublot.

“They saw what Rolex is doing at 665 Fifth Ave. and want to create something just as new and important,” said one source requesting anonymity, about the new, 21-story David Chipperfield Architects design for Rolex now underway at East 53rd Street.

Louis Vuitton’s corner site does not have a height limit, experts say, and could be developed as-of-right with at least 122,700 square feet and perhaps nearly twice as much.

According to air rights consultant Brian Strout of TRIZ Advisory: “Any potential new larger building would just need to comply with the light and air setback requirements as you go higher.”

LVMH could also obtain transferable air rights from other properties, including the adjacent landmark at 5 E. 57th St. leased by its Kering-owned competitor, Yves Saint Laurent.

To come up with a project of around 230,000 square feet, M. Myers Mermel of Tenantwise, who also consults on air rights, suggests that along with a store and offices, LVMH could add a Soho House-like club, a restaurant and luxury spa to replace others that have closed nearby.

“A tower floorplate of an isosceles triangle could offer straight-on views of Central Park for the restaurant, spa, and hotel since the northern neighbor sets back above the 14th floor,” Mermel added of a new project with a potential height of roughly 34 stories. “The easiest path forward is just another stone blob to contain a block of retail alone, the solution which has been favored in that locale over the past century,” Mermel continued. “Let’s hope LVMH chooses to move us forward into the 21st century.”

One of the largest retail transactions this year was Louis Vuitton’s lease with Trump to take over the 65,000-square-foot former Nike space at 4-6 E. 57 St. for seven years — at what sources told The Post was a rent of $20 million — while the Louis Vuitton and Hublot buildings are demolished and rebuilt as one tower.

The fashion house’s sister LVMH company, Tiffany, has been subleasing the space connected to Trump Tower while the redevelopment of its own store on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue is completed. Its grand opening is now scheduled for April 28.

In the same vein, Burberry leased 14,700 square feet at 693 Fifth Ave. — previously Valentino — while its store at 9 E. 57th St. is renovated.

Retail in general has been undergoing a revival as brands have been snapping up better locations due to better pricing and vacancies caused by COVID lockdowns.

“Across the board, prices have leveled off,” said Cory Zelnik of Zelnik & Co.

In the first quarter of 2023, a new CBRE report found the number of available ground floor stores in 16 prime retail corridors dropped 7.2% from the end of 2022 to 206 spaces and is a 16.6% reduction year-over-year. Leasing rose 5.4% from the prior quarter and 14.5% year-over-year.

But as vacancies decreased, prices started to rebound from pandemic lows with average asking rents now $638 per square foot, up 3.7% from the prior quarter and 8% higher than one year ago.

Nearby, Zadig & Voltaire leased a 12,000-square-foot triplex for its headquarters and a store at 515 Madison Ave. while further north, the avenue’s luxury corridor from East 57th to East 72nd streets is filling quickly. “If it’s not open yet you see a sign that it’s coming,” Zelnik said.

Any second-generation restaurant “will rent in a heartbeat,” Zelnik added, no matter the area. “There’s a tremendous entrepreneurial spirit [by restaurants].”

The 8,731-square-foot triplex with outdoor space at 87 Seventh Ave. South on the corner of Barrow Street that Sushisamba held down for 17 years has finally leased to a similar tenant coming from Japan.

The space was represented by Gregory Tannor and Jessica Gerstein and had an asking rent of $50,000 per month.

“Let’s hope LVMH chooses to move us forward into the 21st century.” M. Myers Mermel of Tenantwise

“Food and beverage is extremely hot right now,” agreed Brad Siderow of Douglas Elliman who represented the Japanese tenant. “I’m encountering spaces with multiple parties circling the wagons.”

Aware that central office areas are supporting just a three-day work week, eateries are cutting deals based on that business. “It’s 3.5 days a week … with a half-day either Monday or Friday,” said Jeffrey Roseman of Newmark. But Roseman says a QSR — Quick Service Restaurant — owner said while business is down 10% to 20% on Monday and Friday, he’s up 15% to 20% the other three days of the week.

As tourists have returned, the Meatpacking District, Soho and Times Square have all remained strong.

Represented by Charlie Conover of Odyssey Retail Advisors, the Australian skin care and home company, AESOP, which is now being bought by L’Oreal for $2.5 billion, leased 1,700 square feet at 60 Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District which had an asking rent of $500 per foot.

Jared Epstein of Aurora, which owns the property with William Gottlieb Real Estate, declined to comment on that transaction but has redeveloped most of that stretch between Ninth Ave. and Washington which includes Pastis and Bally.

In 2022, 4.5 million people walked the block, he said, while this year, pedestrian activity is already up 50%.

In Soho, Epstein is seeking a new tenant for the 20,000-square-foot duplex store now occupied by Forever 21 at 568 Broadway which even has a rare escalator. “We are hoping to attract something fresh and new,” he said. The asking rent is $3.5 million per year.

Nearby, H&M secured 18,000 square feet for a new outpost at 591 Broadway.

“Soho continues to be a juggernaut,” observed Peter Braus of Lee & Associates NYC. His firm represented the owners of 119 Spring St. which leased the store to the eccentric German fashion designer, Philip Plein. “He’s a very prominent designer and the store is right in the middle of the neighborhood and indicative of what is going on in the market which is seeing a continued influx of national and international tenants.”

“Retail is on fire, there is a renaissance going on.” Greg Kraut of KPG Funds

Rich Johnson and Gabriel Paisner of Odyssey Retail Advisers represented Plein who previously had a Soho pop-up at 40 Mercer St. in 2018 and a larger store at 625 Madison Ave. — and is building a $200 million estate on land Howard Hughes once owned in the hills of Bel Air.

“We were on Spring Street in front of this space and we couldn’t walk next to each other because there were so many people,” recalled Paisner of the space tour. “Philipp stopped and said, `This is monster foot traffic’ and I said, “That’s because you are in the heart of Soho.”

Similarly, Greg Kraut of KPG Funds said he has multiple tenants touring their Soho retail spaces. “Retail is on fire, there is a renaissance going on,” Kraut said.

In Noho, a “Small is Beautiful, Miniature Art” is opening a pop-up at 718 Broadway between Astor and Waverly places showing tiny works from 32 international artists through August. The lease for 16,500 square feet was completed directly with retail co-op owner Ivan Hakimian.

Multiple health users are also finding it a good time to lock in deals for storefronts. For instance, the veterinarian hospital, Goodvets, leased at 544 Hudson St. in the West Village and at 125 Montague St. in Brooklyn Heights.

Ike Bibi and Carolina Aziz of Kassin Sabbagh Realty represented Hakimian in a 2,500-square-foot lease for a different kind of health company: the tattoo removal chain, Removery, at 4 W. 21st St. in the Flatiron.

In another Flatiron deal, the e-commerce luxury mattress company Saatva, leased 6,700 square feet at 873 Broadway between East 18th and East 19th streets.

In other significant leasing news, J. Crew renewed its 27,000 square feet at 91 Fifth Ave. and Abercrombie & Fitch leased 6,700 square feet at 139 Fifth Ave.

In Hudson Yards, a summer pop-up has now opened featuring the Korean K-Pop band, BTS, and is sure to draw throngs to the center which is yet to get either a retail or office user for the multi-level Neiman Marcus space.

Jack Terzi, of Jack Terzi Real Estate, who owns properties in four boroughs said, “We are negotiating letters of interest with tenants and trying to make win-win deals for everyone.”

In Brooklyn, Williamsburg has few good spaces left while in Queens, Zelnik says Continental Avenue and Austin Street in Forest Hills are “tight as a drum” with rents around $150 a foot and in some cases a little more.

Since cannabis is still illegal on a Federal level, Rob Gilman, partner and co-chair of the real estate group at Anchin, advised reaching out to lenders before leasing to such a tenant. “Cannabis is starting to become a bigger business,” he noted, and could boom if it is legalized by the Feds.

Gary Levy and Randy Sherman of Helmsley Spear have a number of cannabis clients searching for spaces in the city as well as Westchester, Long Island and upstate. “Each town and city is trying to navigate the regulations,” said Sherman. “If there’s an available space, it can’t be near a church or school and that is part of the footwork. We are combing the market because we feel that next round of licenses will be issued in a reasonable period of time.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",neutral,0.9999992847442627,0

April 5 (UPI) -- French billionaire Bernard Arnault's net worth has topped $200 billion making him the world's richest person and just the third person to ever amass that much money. Arnault started the luxury goods company LVMH. Bloomberg's Billionaires Index ranked Arnault ahead of both Bezos and Musk as of Tuesday, with a total net worth of $201 billion. That index shows Arnault with a $25 billion greater net worth than Elon Musk and $73 billion more than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Advertisement

Arnault, 74, is just the third person to have a fortune above $200 billion. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos both reached that milestone before dropping below that amount as tech company stocks dropped.

Musk's wealth also declined after he purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October and said last month that its value had fallen to $20 billion.

Bill Gates and Warren Buffet round out the top five richest people in the world.

Arnault is chairman and CEO of LVMH, owner of Louis Vitton, Christian Dior and Moët & Chandon. He co-founded LVMH 35 years ago and is the majority shareholder. His wealth increased by $2.4 billion on Tuesday.

LVMH stock prices have gone up by 150 percent in the past three years. According to Business Insider, Arnault's wealth has doubled since 2020.

Rihanna partnered with Arnault's LVMH in 2019 on a new fashion label. But less than two years after that deal, LVMH said it was putting Rihanna's Fenty fashion house ""on hold.""

Protesters stormed the LVMH headquarters at 22 Avenue Montaigne in Paris on Thursday, as unrest over French president Emmanuel Macron’s proposed pension reforms continues.

“We come symbolically and peacefully to give an idea to the government: you are looking for money to finance the pensions. Take it from the pockets of billionaires, starting with [LVMH chairman and CEO] Bernard Arnault,” Fabien Villedieu, a representative from the Sud-Rail union, told French news channel BFMTV. Protesters entered the building and left soon after. LVMH declined to comment.

Thursday marks the 12th nationwide day of protests against the pension reform, which increases the retirement age by two years to 64. The unrest started on 19 January and has led to widespread disruption, including to public transport.

Last week, protesters stormed the Paris office of US-based investment firm BlackRock. Today’s demonstration saw people march from Place de l’Opéra to Bastille, by way of the Rue de Rivoli. The police advised businesses to temporarily close shops located along the route. LVMH-owned department store La Samaritaine closed its Rue de Rivoli entrance when the procession passed by, as did department store BHV. Protesters stuck union stickers on La Samaritaine’s glass facade. On Twitter, journalist Louis Pisano posted a photo of a Mango store with a window broken and a graffiti tag that reads “justice sociale” (or social justice). Mango declined to comment.

The storming of LVMH’s HQ comes a day after the luxury conglomerate said first-quarter sales climbed 17 per cent to €21 billion, a solid beat that sent the share price up 5.5 per cent by close of market on Thursday. LVMH’s market capitalisation has surpassed €440 billion and Arnault was the richest man in the world as of 4 April 2023, per Forbes.

During the conglomerate’s annual earnings presentation in late January, Arnault insisted on LVMH’s “great economic and social footprint in France”. The conglomerate recruited 15,000 people in France in 2022, making it the leading recruiter in the country and bringing its total French workforce to 40,000.

“In France, a job created by LVMH generates four with our partners and suppliers, so 160,000 people in France work directly or indirectly for LVMH,” Arnault said. “LVMH opens every year a number of manufacturing facilities, notably for Louis Vuitton. We pay €5 billion per year in corporate taxes worldwide, half of it in France, whereas close to 90 per cent of our products are sold abroad. More than €1 billion is invested in France every year… This is equally important — perhaps more important — than the figures that we are discussing today.”

LVMH revenues top €21 billion in Q1 2023 - Cosmetics Business,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2x2bWgtcmV2ZW51ZXMtdG9wLTIxLWJpbGxpb24taW4tcTEtMjAyMy0yMDgyMDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has reported revenues of over €21bn for the first quarter of 2023.

This was supported by an 11% uplift in sales for the luxury goliath’s Perfumes & Cosmetics business division.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s CFO, said the results were largely driven by make-up and fragrance trading.

Christian Dior saw strong growth during the period, and the Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’Adore fragrances benefited from increased sales.

Rihanna’s Super Bowl appearance also brought greater visibility to the Fenty Beauty brand, said Chrisopher Hollis, Director of Financial Communications at LVMH.

Searches for Rihanna's Fenty Beauty soared by 833% during her performance at the Super Bowl LVII in February 2023.

During her 13-minute set, the star stopped mid-performance to touch up her make-up with a product placement using Fenty Beauty’s Invisimatte Instant Setting + Blotting Powder.

LVMH’s skin care division saw more subdued sales, however.

“This has been going on for a while, due to the fact we have less growth in Asia and the bulk of the growth is coming from Europe and the US,” added Guinoy.

“This creates some bias in favour of fragrances and make-up.""

Hollis also highlighted Sephora’s growth in Q1, which saw revenue and market share increases across the US, Europe and the Middle East.

“The first Sephora store in the UK enjoyed an excellent start,” he added.

Sephora’s first bricks-and-mortar store in the UK opened at Westfield White City in West London on 8 March 2023.

A dedicated beauty hub which offers beauty services and treatments features in the 6,000sqft retail space.

“The group will continue to pursue its strategy focused on the development of its brands, driven by a sustained policy of innovation and investment as well as by a constant quest for quality in its products, their desirability and their distribution.”

Additionally, the brand owner saw consistent growth across its key trading regions.

Asia experienced the most significant rebound following the lifting of travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and generated over 36% of the trading period's revenue.

Japan in particular was one of the top performing countries in the APAC area, which saw a 7% increase in sales compared with Q1 2022.

Guiony said part of the growth has come from an unexpected surge in tourists to Japan.

But another key contributor has been increased sales from domestic consumers.

“It seems to be that the Japanese consumer is very confident about the economy, about the global situation and inflation,” added Guiony.

“Inflation strikes way less in Japan than elsewhere, and buyers are active in terms of shopping.”

Sales in Europe, meanwhile, benefited from robust demand from local customers and international travellers.

However, the US market grew by only 8% in Q1, the results of softer demand in the country.

LVMH recently shook up its Beauty division, naming Stéphane Rinderknech CEO.

He oversees the group’s perfumes and cosmetics category globally, which includes Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain and Kendo.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999994039535522}",positive,0.9999994039535522,1
LVMH to name new head of fashion group as Toledano steps down - Vogue Business,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXRvLW5hbWUtbmV3LWhlYWQtb2YtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC1hcy10b2xlZGFuby1zdGVwcy1kb3du0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH will be appointing a new chairman and CEO for its fashion group division, the conglomerate confirmed at its annual general meeting today, as Sidney Toledano transitions into a different role.

Reports have been circulating that Michael Burke, former chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton and since February 2023, strategic advisor to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, is likely to succeed Toledano at the helm of the fashion group, which includes Celine, Givenchy, Loewe, Patou, Pucci, Marc Jacobs and Kenzo.

Online fashion publication Miss Tweed first reported that Burke “is set to become the new CEO”. Sources told Vogue Business an appointment is likely to happen this summer. LVMH declined to comment on whether Burke is in line for the job.

At the AGM, Arnault thanked Toledano for “almost 30 years [of] working together”. “I want to highlight the exceptional work he has done, when he headed Christian Dior Couture and in his role of being in charge of the fashion group,” Arnault told shareholders. He hinted that Toledano was moving to another role within the company, although he did not give details. “He has not left, he is called to other functions. We will continue to work together in another context. I won’t say more, I'll talk to you about it next year,” said Arnault.

Toledano joined Dior in 1994, and was promoted to chairman and CEO of the brand four years later. He moved to become head of the fashion group division in 2018, handing over the running of Dior to Pietro Beccari. Alongside his LVMH role, Toledano is also chairman of Paris fashion school Institut Français de la Mode and president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. In December 2022, he stepped down from his role as CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company that controls 41 per cent of the capital and 56 per cent of the voting rights in the LVMH Group, after 20 years. Antoine Arnault, the eldest son of Bernard Arnault, who’s also CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana, and supervises all communication, image and environment issues related to the LVMH Group, succeeded Toledano in the position.

Speaking of the fashion group, Arnault called out several brands successes, including Celine, which “passed the €2 billion mark in 2022 and is approaching the €3 billion mark”, as well as Loewe whose creative director, Jonathan Anderson, he called a “designer full of potential”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",neutral,0.999993085861206,0
Pension Protestors Storm LVMH's Paris Headquarters - Jing Daily,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXBhcmlzLXBlbnNpb24tcHJvdGVzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French pension protestors stormed LVMH’s Paris headquarters Thursday morning, following news that the French luxury conglomerate’s share price had rose 4.6 percent in early trading to hit a record high of €875 (965).

LVMH’s rocketing stock value, partly attributable to rising sales in China, came after President Emmanuel Macron rammed legislation raising the retirement age in France to 64 from 62 through parliament without a vote on March 16. The move galvanized opposition to the policy and enflamed ongoing protests against the change. Today, a French court will rule on the constitutionality of Macron’s move.

“If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,” union leader Fabien Villedieu told CNN , referring to the conglomerate’s head office.

The conglomerate had begun 2023 on a strong note; the reopening of the Chinese economy following three years of strict lockdowns helped LVMH’s Q1 sales grow 17 percent, while in February the group announced that superstar Pharrell Williams would take the helm of Louis Vuitton menswear, one of its portfolio brands. In January, LVMH became the first European company to surpass €400 billion in market value.

LVMH’s climbing share price propelled CEO Bernard Arnault’s net worth past 200 billion earlier this week, making him the world’s wealthiest person by far. Second is Elon Musk with 188 billion.

French citizens meanwhile have struggled with inflation and stagnant wages. In October 2022, protestors went on strike in response to the skyrocketing cost of living. In January, opponents of Macron’s pension reform ignited a series of protests and strikes. Garbage piled up on the streets of Paris in March as trash collectors went on strike in opposition to the retirement age policy. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has supported the protests, while Macron’s government says the reform is necessary to balance the pension budget.

LVMH has raised its own age limit. Shareholders voted to raise the age limit for a serving CEO from 75 to 80, letting Arnault, now 74, remain at the helm for another few years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9976502060890198}",neutral,0.9976502060890198,0

The Guardian reports that shares in LVMH closed up 90 euro cents (0.1%) to €902.00 ($993.94) on April 24, giving the company – whose roster includes Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer watches and Bulgari and Tiffany jewelry – a market capitalization of €454bn, or half a trillion dollars.

LVMH shares have soared by 30% so far this year propelling it into the top 10 of the world’s most valuable listed companies.

The new valuation puts the stake held by its chair and chief executive, Bernard Arnault, at $212bn – cementing his position as the world’s richest person, $47bn ahead of Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, in second place.

Earlier this month LVMH reported a 17% increase in first quarter sales, more than double analyst expectations.

Last year it achieved record sales of €79.2bn and has begun a €1.5bn share buyback program.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9984601736068726}",positive,0.9984601736068726,1
The Gerald Genta Watch Brand Is Being Revived Thanks to LVMH - Robb Report,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2dlcmFsZC1nZW50YS1icmFuZC1yZXZpdmFsLWx2bWgtMTIzNDgyNjU1Ny_SAVxodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL3dhdGNoLWNvbGxlY3Rvci9nZXJhbGQtZ2VudGEtYnJhbmQtcmV2aXZhbC1sdm1oLTEyMzQ4MjY1NTcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No name looms larger in watch design than Gérald Genta‘s.

The prolific designer—who many credit with saving the Swiss watch industry from the Quartz Crisis of the 1970s thanks to penning popular designs such as Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, the Patek Philippe Nautilus, and the recently revived IWC Ingenieur—will soon have his timepieces produced anew thanks to LVMH.

La Fabrique du Temps, Louis Vuitton’s watchmaking manufacture, announced this week that it had acquired the Gérald Genta brand, and will be producing “high complications made in small quantities.” Bringing the story full circle, Fabrique du Temps founders and master watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini have the blessing of Evelyne Genta, the late Gérald’s widow and business partner. (The two worked together for Genta in the 1980s and ’90s on complicated watches.) Further, Evelyne is granting Louis Vuitton access to her late husband’s archives, which contain hundreds of designs that were never produced.

Ever since LV’s acquisition of Fabrique du Temps in 2011, the brand has refocused itself on high watchmaking: Following the subsequent purchase of dial-maker Lémain Quadrant in 2012 and the opening of a new 4,000-sq. meter facility in Meyrin in 2014, the LVMH-owned company is in a position similar to that of Bulgari to become one of the most exciting watchmakers of the 2020s. And though it’s anybody’s guess which designs will be brought to fruition first, access to the Genta archives mean that collectors may see watches unlike any they experienced while Genta was still active.

WATCH

Genta, who was born in Geneva in 1931, was a larger-than-life character from the start, famously tossing his jewelry-making tools into the Rhône after getting fed up with his original vocation. As a young man in the 1950s, he designed the Polerouter for Universal Genève, and his career as a watch designer was off to the races. He continued this success with the Constellation line for Omega, and worked at such a furious pace that it’s said his watch designs numbered in the thousands by the time he passed away in 2011.

In the early 1970s, Genta was commissioned by Audemars Piguet to design a next-generation “luxury sports watch” that would reverse the company’s ailing fortunes during the trying Quartz Crisis. His 1972 Royal Oak wasn’t a hit at first—it was almost laughably expensive, and unusual in its aesthetics and construction—but rather quickly became a phenomenon. In fact, the model was so popular that none other than Patek Philippe requested a similar watch just a few short years later, resulting in 1976’s Nautilus. IWC’s beloved Ingenieur—revived just this year—and Bulgari’s Octo also sprang from his brilliant mind.

Later in life, Genta would establish his own eponymous brand, working with master watchmaker Pierre-Michel Golay to develop highly complicated pieces that celebrated his meshing of more conventional and unusual geometric shapes. His 1984 series of Disney wristwatches cut against the grain of his more serious work for AP and Patek, but he cared not a whit; his Grand Sonnerie of 1994, meanwhile took five years of R&D to bring to fruition. Cartier later came calling for a complicated version of the Pasha, as did many clients seeking pieces unique and ambitious commissions. Genta’s intellectual and creative aspirations seemingly knew no bounds.

In 1996, Singapore-based The Hour Glass acquired a majority stake in the Gérald Genta brand, which was later purchased by Bulgari in 2000. Though the Italian-founded luxury goods supplier produced Genta-branded Mickey Mouse watches from time to time throughout the years, it also used the savoir faire from the Genta brand to design its own line of extraordinary wristwatches in the form of the Octo and Octo Finissimo lines. One look at these award-winning timepieces leaves no doubt that Genta’s designs of the 1970s clearly inspired Bulgari’s contemporary collections to great effect.

The luxury conglomerate on Thursday revealed its intent to purchase the Platinum Invest group in order to strengthen its high and fine jewelry manufacturing capabilities — with a particular focus on enhancing Tiffany & Co.’s production output.

A spokesperson declined to reveal terms of the deal, aside from that it is expected to close before the end of this summer following standard regulatory procedures.

According to sources, the Platinum Invest group manufactures for luxury jewelers across the world, including brands like Cartier and Bulgari, the latter of which is also owned by LVMH. It is understood that those existing clients will remain unaffected by the acquisition and that LVMH will also utilize the workshops for other jewelry brands in its portfolio.

The Platinum Invest group is a holding company of five workshops across the Grand Est region in France that includes the companies Orest and Abysse. In 2018, Orest was able to expand with strategic investment from Andera Partners and BpiFrance — and renamed itself Platinum Invest. The group acquired Abysse in 2022.

The Platinum Invest group employs more than 800 artisans that will help Tiffany speed its high and fine jewelry pipelines. While Tiffany will add artisans in France, a spokesperson said that the jeweler’s existing workshops in Pelham, New York, and Cumberland, Rhode Island, will remain in operation and this acquisition is only meant to add that production framework. Tiffany’s high and fine jewelry design studios will continue to be based in New York City.

“We are delighted to be able to welcome Orest and Abysse into the Tiffany & Co. family,” said Tiffany chief executive officer Anthony Ledru. “This acquisition is an important step for our house; it will allow us to reinforce our commitment to the highest level of quality, while expanding our production capacity to meet the growing demand of our clients. We are certain that this acquisition will enable us to pursue our momentum and our ambitions for excellence in the global fine and high jewelry market.”

“After years of fruitful collaboration, we are very proud to join the LVMH Group and strengthen our ties with such an iconic house as Tiffany & Co. and, thus, be able to contribute to its growth and development. We will be keen to put our skills and technologies at the service of its products to design unique and durable jewelry,” said Denis De Becker, president for Orest and Abysse.

In a sit-down interview with WWD last month, Ledru laid out plans to accelerate Tiffany’s high jewelry sales. The category doubled in revenue in the 2022 fiscal year.

In its Q1 earnings call on Wednesday, LVMH highlighted Tiffany’s continued performance by calling it an “excellent start to the year.” A group presentation called out Tiffany’s “record performance of high jewelry.”

According to a source, it’s understood that LVMH will continue to eye similar acquisitions in the future as it works toward strengthening its vertically integrated capabilities.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8033946752548218}",positive,0.8033946752548218,1

ThePackHub Luxury brand Owner LVMH to Accelerate the Use of Sustainable Materials for Cosmetic Products

French multinational luxury brand owner LVMH, is collaborating with Dow Chemicals to accelerate the use of sustainable packaging across LVMH’s perfume and cosmetic products. This partnership would enable both bio-based and circular plastics to be integrated into several of the beauty multinational’s product applications without compromising the functionality or quality of the packaging. The collaboration will see the use of circular plastics, which are made from bio-based and plastic waste feedstock respectively, and will be used to produce sustainable SURLYN ionomers, polymers used to manufacture premium perfume caps and cosmetic cream jars. Bio-based feedstocks for the production of bio-based SURLYN can include raw materials such as used cooking oil. A spokesperson for LVMH said that as part of their Life 360 program, they had made the decision that their packaging would contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in the “near future”.

ThePackHub Los Angeles Organic Grocer Erewhon First to Stock Fully Biodegradable Water Bottles

Erewhon is a premium organic grocer based in Los Angeles. They recently entered into a partnership with Cove, the California-based innovation company that manufactures fully biodegradable water bottles. The partnership makes the supermarket the first retailer of Cove’s water bottles, which we have been tracking the progress of in the Innovation Zone. The company says that Cove bottles are plastic-free, biodegradable, renewable, non-toxic, and compostable, as are the caps. They are made with polyhydroxyalkanoate(PHA), a sustainably sourced, naturally occurring biopolymer. PHA is produced and consumed by microorganisms that occur all over the world, including soil-inhabiting and marine microorganisms. The bottle is screen printed with UV-cured ink. Cove partnered with Living Ink to create a UV-cured ink that uses black pigment derived from algae. This replaces the usual carbon black pigment derived from fossil fuels. Cove says that they expect them to take a maximum of five years to be fully broken down by microorganisms in a “reasonable natural environment”.

ThePackHub Tomato Processor Bonnysa Launches New Product With Lid Made From Bio-Based PP

Alicante-based tomato processors Bonnysa and sustainable packaging manufacturer ITC Packaging have collaborated on the launch of a new lid for the packaging of its grated tomato range. The new solution for Bonnysa’s grated tomato is made from bio-based polypropylene, a material from non-fossil fuel sources that helps reduce carbon emissions while guaranteeing the sustainability of raw materials. This second generation biopolymer is different from the fossil raw material because of its plant origin as it comes from organic waste that is processed until it turns into polymers. To guarantee the origin of the raw material, ITC has accepted the system of ISCC Plus certification, a protocol that has allowed the incorporation of new bio-circular materials that optimize the sustainability of packaging into the ITC portfolio. This certification has enabled ITC to launch its first circular-packaging projects, made from material from advanced recycling, and therefore suitable for food contact.

LVMH Just Became Europe’s First $500 Billion Company - Robb Report,"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvbHZtaC01MDAtYmlsbGlvbi1tYXJrZXQtdmFsdWF0aW9uLTEyMzQ4MzQ5Nzcv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3cy9sdm1oLTUwMC1iaWxsaW9uLW1hcmtldC12YWx1YXRpb24tMTIzNDgzNDk3Ny9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH just extended its record-breaking streak in 2023.

At the top of the year, the luxury giant’s share prices rose by 0.4 percent to a record high of $860 (€795.7). The French conglomerate achieved a $434 billion (€400 billion) market cap for the first time in history as a result. On Tuesday, LVMH set a new benchmark with a $500 billion market valuation, making it the first European company to accomplish the feat—and a five-fold increase since 2016.

Booming sales of luxury goods in China and the strengthening euro have contributed to the company’s new financial milestone, Bloomberg reports. Shares in LVMH were up 0.3 percent to €903.70 ($992.69) on Monday, but analysts predict the price could go higher. Despite a reported slowdown in LVMH’s U.S. growth—specifically with demand for Cognac and leather goods—analysts see room for future gains, with its stocks potentially hitting up to €1,000 ($1,098) in the next year.

“LVMH is too cheap given the attractiveness of the luxury goods sector, its strong portfolio of brands and best-in-class execution,” says Bank of America’s Ashley Wallace in a report. That 75-brand portfolio includes the likes of Dior, Fendi, Loewe, Bulgari, and Celine. One Goldman Sachs portfolio strategist is bullish on LVMH because of “robust margins thanks to their pricing power,” says Lilia Peytavin. Essentially, there’s still a lot of profitability to wring out of the luxury sector compared to other industries. “This differentiates luxury from tech, whose margins have been contracting for several quarters already.”

LVMH’s increasing value this year has also pumped a lot more dough into CEO Bernard Arnault’s personal ledger. Earlier this month, the French tycoon became the world’s richest person for a second time with a total net worth of $201 billion (now $213 billion). The dizzying amount reflected a $39 billion increase in Arnault’s finances this year alone, and made him one of three people—alongside Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos—to surpass the $200 billion mark. At the time, LVMH’s stock price stood at a record high of $186.15 on April 4. One month prior, the company announced it would be buying back $1.6 billion of its own shares.

If you’re keeping tabs on the conglomerate, you might also know that a real-life Succession is playing out within its luxury empire. According to The Wall Street Journal, Arnault has been “auditioning” his five kids to run LVMH since they were young.

The billionaire’s son Frederic Arnault is the CEO of Tag Heuer, Alexandre Arnault is an exec at Tiffany & Co., Jean Arnault oversees marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watch department, and his daughter Delphine Arnault now helms Christian Dior. If one of them does end up taking over, they’ll inherit the company their father has turned into one of the world’s largest.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997749924659729}",positive,0.9997749924659729,1

Bernard Arnault, the head of the luxury conglomerate LVMH and the richest man in the world, has long been preparing his five children to take over once he steps down, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. It’s not clear exactly when that will be, but Arnault is making sure that any one of his kids could soon be in his position.

Beginning when they were little, Arnault would test his children in math and bring them along on business trips and to negotiations. Now, they all hold roles within the LVMH empire: Delphine is the CEO of Christian Dior; Antoine is the CEO of the listed company that holds the family’s stake in LVMH; Alexandre is the executive vice president of Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric is the head of TAG Heuer; and Jean is the director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Once a month, the six get together for a 90-minute lunch at LVMH’s Paris headquarters, where Arnault asks his kids for advice on everything from specific managers within the company to whether a major shake-up should occur. And despite the fact that they’re all ostensibly vying for the top job, the kids themselves get along swimmingly, according to Sidney Toledano, who oversees a number of LVMH’s fashion brands.

Arnault, 74, isn’t required to retire until he reaches the age of 80, and he hasn’t explicitly said that he’ll name one of his children as his successor. The only thing he’s noted is that the next LVMH chief will be chosen based on merit, the WSJ wrote.

“You have to choose whoever is best at a given point in time considering the challenges,” Toledano told the newspaper. “It’s what he does with his managers, his advisers, and I think it’s what he’ll do with his children.”

Whoever ends up stepping into Arnault’s shoes, they’ll be taking over a company currently valued at $480 billion. (Arnault himself is worth $208 billion.) More than that, though, they’ll be tasked with carrying on the businessman’s legacy in the luxury world. Thankfully, he’s been training his kids for decades to do just that.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999967813491821}",neutral,0.9999967813491821,0
LVMH's head of research: 'What matters for Dior is to invent and be a pioneer in beauty' - Glossy,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvbHZtaHMtaGVhZC1vZi1yZXNlYXJjaC13aGF0LW1hdHRlcnMtZm9yLWRpb3ItaXMtdG8taW52ZW50LWFuZC1iZS1hLXBpb25lZXItaW4tYmVhdXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reverse aging research is all the rage, with medical companies and now beauty brands exploring how to tap into a newer and more advanced concept than anti-aging.

Most recently, Dior Beauty stepped into the spotlight with its late-March announcement at the 21st Aesthetic and Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress in Monaco that it had established an International Reverse Aging Scientific Advisory Board. Comprising the board are 600 researchers and 18 experts, including Dr. Nicola Neretti, a biologist at the Institute for Brain & Neural Systems at Brown University, and Dr. David Furman, the director of the 1000 Immunomes Project at Stanford University. Dior’s own research will add to the knowledge base on aging science around stem cells, inflammation and cell communication. The idea is to better understand the 12 signs of aging, including genomic instability, epigenetic changes, stem cell fatigue and chronic inflammation. It will then weave that knowledge into skin-care product innovations to reverse these signs, according to Bruno Bavouzet, evp of R&D at LMVH, who oversees all beauty brands including Dior, Givenchy, Fresh and Benefit Cosmetics.

“Our No. 1 goal is understanding the different path [around aging], from a biological standpoint. With time, we will make discoveries on the real mechanisms that accelerate aging,” he said. “No. 2 is to identify the potential actions that we can have through cosmetic [products] and how can we can [reverse] the biological age.”

Bavouzet spoke with Glossy further about the concept of reverse aging, including why Dior is exploring the topic, what can be gained with the new advisory board and what a “collective intelligence approach” means. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

What does ‘reverse aging’ mean?

“When we talk about reverse aging, basically what we know is that chronological age is different from biological age. That means that if you are 40- or 50-years-old, that definitely is your chronological age, but your biological age and the age of your cells can be different. We know in medicine that you can reverse your biological age by adding good health practices. What we don’t always understand is the mechanisms of these aging processes and how they are connected to each other. The first stage [of our research] is to better understand the underlying mechanisms, with all their biological complexity, and why we are aging differently.

Reverse aging starts with the 12 hallmarks of aging. Historically, anti-aging people used to work on one approach, perhaps it was stem cells or polymers, et cetera. But we believe the best approach [to reverse aging or anti-aging] is a holistic approach. But that can be complex. Because there has been progress in biological discoveries and big data, we are able to [process] complex information.”

What is the board’s purpose and what does it do?

“We believe [the field of] reverse aging is impacted by very different biological mechanisms. And we believe that we need to have all the people in different fields work together, exchange information and build bridges between topics. We are working on reverse aging internally, obviously, but we want to accelerate that [research], meaning that we need more insights, from a scientific standpoint, on discoveries, [as well as] more data, and more experience. The board is advising us on our research. It will regroup several times a year. But throughout the year, we might also have continuous exchanges on specific topics with around four people. It’s about building what I would call a ‘collective intelligence approach,’ meaning that we are grouping all these people who are experts on the human body, while we [Dior] work on the skin. Not all of them are skin experts, but they can help us translate some research on different [scientific] topics to the skin, as well.”

Why is Dior Beauty the right LVMH brand for this research?

“Dior has always been science-focused. Dior was the first brand back in the 1980s to launch liposomes in the skin-care industry. That’s really something that was important at the time with big effects. It’s true that when you think about Dior, you obviously think about fashion and makeup. But Dior has always been thinking about and integrating the idea of how to make women happier. At an early stage [in the brand’s history] it started to launch skin-care products that were acting on the transformation of the skin. What matters for Dior is to invent and be a pioneer in beauty, as it has in the fashion industry.”

What has spurred this reverse aging focus?

“There is a continuity from what has historically been the focus of anti-aging. The topic is also led by medicine. There has been a lot of progress in medicine and many therapies, like stem cells which are considered the ‘mother cell,’ … and trying to apply the same science to cosmetics. Obviously, we cannot do exactly the same thing. But when we started to work about 10-15 years ago on the microbiome of the skin, we got inspiration from work that was focused on [gastrointestinal science]. It is a pretty similar approach we are conducting here with reverse aging.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997026324272156}",neutral,0.9997026324272156,0
French protesters storm headquarters of luxury goods company LVMH - New York Post,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzEzL2ZyZW5jaC1wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLXN0b3JtLWx2bWgtaGVhZHF1YXJ0ZXJzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzEzL2ZyZW5jaC1wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLXN0b3JtLWx2bWgtaGVhZHF1YXJ0ZXJzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Protesters stormed the Paris headquarters of luxury goods giant LVMH on Thursday to demand the rich foot the bill for a controversial overhaul of the country’s pension system.

Hundreds of union activists poured through the entrance doors of LVMH’s building on ritzy Avenue Montaigne, where boss Bernard Arnault — the world’s richest man — has his office.

Footage from the chaotic scene showed protesters climbing up an escalator that led to the higher levels of the office building.

“If you’re looking for money to finance pensions, take it from the pockets of billionaires,” said Sud Rail union representative Fabien Villedieu.

Villedieu said the protest was “symbolic and peaceful.”

France has faced waves of protests this year as workers slam a plan by French President Emmanuel Macron to raise the country’s retirement age to 64 from its current 62 by the year 2030.

Macron’s government argues the change is necessary to ensure the pension budget stays solvent in the years ahead.

The French president angered critics by advancing the legislation through special constitutional powers, rather than a parliamentary vote. Detractors have also accused Macron of catering to the rich.

The disorder at LVMH’s headquarters occurred a day before France’s Constitutional Council will determine whether the proposed overhaul is legal. Protesters argue the Macron-backed overhaul should be subject to a referendum or nixed entirely.

“We don’t want to work until 64,” Kathy Brochard, a 50-year-old teacher, said at the Paris protest.

“We still hope that, at some point, someone in high places will decide to abandon this law, sit around a table and look at pension funding differently,” added Francis Bourget, a 52-year-old postal service worker.

LVMH is led by Arnault,

Arnault, 74, who co-founded the luxury goods conglomerate and serves as its chairman and CEO, has an estimated net worth of $198 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

LVMH’s holdings include an array of well-known global brands, including Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior, Fendi as well as its namesake Louis Vuitton.

Approximately 380,000 people participated in the union-led protests across France on Thursday alone, authorities said. The demonstrations reportedly prompted some clashes between protesters and police, as well as dozens of injuries.

Macron has pledged to meet with union leaders following the council’s decision to discuss other potential solutions to their concerns. However, the critics say they won’t be satisfied unless the plan is withdrawn.

“After three months of mobilization, I would lie if I told you that there is no fatigue. We are tired, but a mobilization is like a marathon,” Villedieu added. “We won’t give up.”

The French luxury company reported its first revenue for the first quarter of the year which saw a major jump in sales of 17%.

The company’s early success is in due part to the rebound of Chinese demand, as well as the decent trajectory of U.S. sales and the uptick in Japan to boost the confidence in LVMH. The French conglomerate has noticed that revenue increases have been because of the soaring demand for leather goods, as well as the sharp jumps at Sephora and DFS. By March 31, LVMH’s revenue totaled €21.04 billion EUR, despite “a geopolitical and economic environment which remains uncertain.”

So far, all business divisions except wines and spirits have recorded double-digit increases in the first quarter. LVMH cites the growth in Europe and Japan to be due to international travelers and local consumers. In a statement, the company noted, “Asia experienced a significant rebound following the lifting of health restrictions.” Revenues in its fashion and leather goods division including mega-brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior rose 18%. Other brands like Celine, Loewe, Rimowa and others also had “remarkable” performances.

The increase in revenues has surpassed forecasts and even saw its watches and jewelry segment grow 11% in the first quarter. The “excellent” start pertains to Tiffany & Co., Chaumet, Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith. LVMH also noted that Fenty Beauty definitely benefited from the visibility received from Rihanna’s Super Bowl performance.

Bernard Arnault's succession dilemma – which of his children will inherit his luxury empire? - The Telegraph,"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzA0LzIyL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLWRpb3ItbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zdWNjZXNzaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Bernard Arnault was asked in 2015 what got him out of bed in the morning, he was adamant that it was not money. The world’s richest man said his wealth was “just a consequence of what I do”.

“The reality is that most of the money is in the company,” the LVMH boss told The Telegraph. “It’s certainly not the kind of money that means that I could tomorrow go buy whatever I want or go to the casino and go mad.”

Instead, Arnault said it was being able to make decisions. “What feels good is choice,” he added. “Having the freedom of choice.”

Having that choice may not feel so good today. While succession planning is said to have been on Arnault’s mind for decades, now – at the age of 74 – the question of who will take over from him at LVMH is looming large.

“Even billionaires are not eternal,” says Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “The more time goes by, the more this will be a focus.”

It is likely to be a family affair, though that does little to narrow the field: all five of Arnault’s children have been brought into senior roles in LVMH. The decision of which will step up to the top job is far from clear-cut.

Not that LVMH is alone in facing the question of succession: it is also dogging the Murdoch clan, while at Zara owner Inditex, the founder’s daughter Marta Ortega recently ascended to the chairman post.

But LVMH is a juggernaut against which few businesses can compare. It is the largest luxury goods company in the world, with a market capitalisation of €450bn (£398bn). Its portfolio of companies encompasses luxury fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, jewellery brand Tiffany’s, suitcase line Rimowa and champagne maker Moet & Chandon.

“LVMH is the dominant player in the modern luxury industry,” says Solca.

Arnault’s oldest child Delphine is seen by many as the most likely candidate to take over at the helm. She was named as chief executive of Christian Dior – LVMH’s second largest brand after Louis Vuitton, where she had previously been deputy CEO – earlier this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999598264694214}",neutral,0.9999598264694214,0

The luxury goods titan highlighted Europe and Japan as enjoying “strong growth momentum” in Q1 and benefitting from “robust demand from local customers and international travelers.” Meanwhile, the United States, “a market which continues to grow,” had a “steady performance” during the quarter, and “Asia experienced a significant rebound following the lifting of health restrictions.” The group’s prized Fashion & Leather Goods division, alone, generated 10.7 billion euros ($11.88 billion), up 18 percent YoY, driven by success at Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Loewe, Loro Piana, Rimowa, and Berluti.

In a corresponding conference call this week, LVMH management stated that it is “extremely optimistic for China in 2023,” as “numbers in the first quarter bode well for the rest of the year.” The U.S., on the other hand, is seeing a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, with LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony says that LVMH had seen a “little bit of slowdown there for its fashion and leather goods, as well as jewelry and watches.”

Another interesting takeaway: LVMH management spoke to the rise of “quiet luxury” in the call on Wednesday, saying that it does not see this trending in branding – or better yet, lack thereof – to be a problem since most consumers will continue to favor products with logos. “Nevertheless, LVMH has seen this no-logo luxury trend before and is prepared to accommodate all customers’ preferences,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca stated in a corresponding note. “The company is ready to offer products tailored to clients’ needs, whether they prefer quiet luxury or more overtly branded items.”

On the trademark/parallel market front, LVMH is “cautious” about business on China’s duty-free island of Hainan “due to concerns about grey market Daigou/parallel trading activities.” However, they are interested in the second phase of Hainan development, per Solca, “where Hainan is expected to become a tax-free region similar to Hong Kong.” This is expected to result in significant price differentials between the Chinese mainland and Hainan, which management expects will see 40 to 50 million tourists per year.

As for Korea, “which is becoming an important market due to its growth and size, Chinese tourists, and Koreans shopping at home,” LVMH management says that it is satisfied with their performance in the local market, with Korean tourists, and controlling the grey market business there. (This is something that Chanel has similarly been working on, with the brand making headlines in 2021 and 2022 for putting quotas in place, including in the Korean market, to limit on the number of products that consumers can buy from Chanel each year to “protect customers and curb bulk buying,”)

At the same time, Solca states that the Chinese cosmetics market is “heavily disrupted by the grey/parallel market, which puts pressure on prices and margin,” including for LVMH. Management says the group has stayed away from discounting to protect the equity of its brands. This is point that they have previously made, including in the group’s 2020 annual report, in which management revealed that “in a sector suffering from the decline in international traveler spend and makeup, LVMH’s major brands chose to be selective in their distribution and, unlike certain competitors, limited promotions and refused to sell indirectly to the Chinese parallel market, which presents major risks to the medium term desirability for brands that follow that route.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999804496765137}",positive,0.9999804496765137,1
PETA Hits LVMH and Hermès With Anti–Exotic Skins Actions on Day of Annual Meetings - PETA,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnL21lZGlhL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcGV0YS1oaXRzLWx2bWgtYW5kLWhlcm1lcy13aXRoLWFudGktZXhvdGljLXNraW5zLWFjdGlvbnMtb24tZGF5LW9mLWFubnVhbC1tZWV0aW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As a Shareholder, the Group Stages Disruptions to Call For an End to Cruelly Obtained Skins

London –

Although many major designers have dropped exotic skins from their lines, LVMH and Hermès are still selling these cruelly produced materials. As the two fashion houses held their annual meetings in Paris today, PETA—a shareholder in both companies—targeted the events to call for an end to their support of this bloody trade.

At LVMH, a PETA representative attempted to call on CEO Bernard Arnault to end exotic-skin sales, but, excluded from the meeting space, she instead protested outside the meeting room as a bloody “snake,” loudly informing shareholders about how snakes and other reptiles are tortured so that their skins can end up as luxury accessories. Outside, activists held a “dead snake” and a sign where passersby could read, “LVMH: Ban Exotic Skins.”

Photos of the action targeting LVMH are available here.

PETA’s question—submitted to LVMH ahead of the meeting—ended with this: “Mr. Arnault, in your last report on social and environmental responsibility, you stated that ‘success is only worthwhile if it is virtuous,’ but there is nothing virtuous about systemic cruelty and the exploitation of animals for the manufacturing of your bags. When will LVMH act on its promise to ‘forge a new alliance between LVMH and nature’ by removing fur and exotic skins from its future collections?”

At the same time, a PETA representative also attended the Hermès meeting, carrying an apple leather briefcase to emphasize the availability of luxurious ethical and eco-friendly materials. A photo of the PETA representative calling on CEO Axel Dumas to ban exotic-skin sales is available here.

A PETA Asia investigation into Indonesian slaughterhouses that supply LVMH shows snakes being inflated with water, beaten with hammers, and cut with razors while they were likely still conscious. An investigation by the Kindness Project, filmed on farms owned by Hermès, revealed crocodiles being kept in cramped, barren enclosures and cages and then mutilated and stabbed with a screwdriver.

The full texts of PETA’s questions to LVMH and Hermès are available upon request. PETA notes that it takes three crocodiles to make just one Hermès bag and that designers such as Mulberry, Victoria Beckham, Chanel, Stella McCartney, Burberry, and many others don’t use exotic skins.

PETA—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to wear”—opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview.

The world's richest person: How Bernard Arnault rose to the top - The Week,"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy8xMDIyOTUxL2Etd29sZi1pbi1jYXNobWVyZS1ob3ctYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJlY2FtZS10aGUtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury conglomerate LVMH has passed $500 billion in value, becoming the first European company to ever achieve this milestone. While the average person may not know LVMH, they definitely know the brands it owns, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Hennessy, Moët & Chandon, Givenchy, Princess Yachts, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and many more.

This $500 billion mark cements the status of LVMH's founder, Bernard Arnault, as the world's richest person. Like his company, Arnault is likely not a household name, but Forbes puts his net worth at $243.4 billion. In comparison, the world's second-richest person, Elon Musk, is worth $171.5 billion. Given LVMH's ballooning value, it is likely that Arnault's net worth will only continue to rise.

While the French-born Arnault is the face of the operation, his family also shares a sizable portion of this wealth. His daughter Delphine is the CEO of Dior and the vice president of Louis Vuitton, while his son Antoine is Dior's vice-chair. Arnault's other three children also have roles in LVMH-held brands, The New York Times reports, with major positions in Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Louis Vuitton.

How did Arnault, who is not particularly recognizable outside of luxury circles, make it to the one percent of the one percent?

Arnault's beginnings

Bernard Arnault was born in Roubaix, France, to an industrial family. Described by France24 as a man ""driven by ambition who built his own empire,"" Arnault told the Financial Times his mother had a love of Dior that was passed down to him.

Arnault would eventually study engineering at the École Polytechnique, one of the most prestigious universities in France, Insider reports, before making a small fortune working for his father's construction business. Everything changed for Arnault, though, when he purchased a struggling textile company called Agache-Willot-Boussac in 1984 for $15 million. This company owned a number of French department stores, Insider adds, but also another more notable brand: Christian Dior.

Arnault sold almost all of Agache-Willot-Boussac's other brands to focus on bringing Dior to the top, with The New York Times reporting in the late 1980s that his goal was to create the world's biggest luxury conglomerate. Within a few years, that plan was in motion.

The creation of LVMH and the company's future

After selling off most of Agache-Willot-Boussac, Arnault used the profits to bring together two major luxury brands, Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, with the three companies combining to form LVMH in 1987. Arnault eventually bought a controlling stake in the company in 1989, becoming its principal shareholder.

With LVMH, headlined by Dior, now under his control, Arnault ""led an aggressive expansion, turning LVMH into the world's largest luxury goods firm,"" Forbes reported, slowly acquiring all of the aforementioned brands plus other companies like Loewe, Sephora, Marc Jacobs, and Celine.

Today, the company is by far the largest luxury conglomerate on the planet, controlling more than 70 brands. Its revenues in 2022 totaled $86 billion, according to Forbes. Arnault overtook Musk to become the world's richest person in December of that year. His aggressive acquisitions have earned Arnault both admiration and ire, with The Wall Street Journal noting that many in the industry call him a ""wolf in cashmere.""

The future for LVMH will likely bring more of the same. Recent reports show that despite the downturn in the economy, the luxury goods market remains resilient. At the end of 2021, Arnault announced that LVHM was looking to recruit nearly 25,000 more young people by the end of 2022.

However, Arnault is 74 years old, so thoughts have inevitably turned to the next generation of LVMH leadership. While all of his children are potentially in the running to lead the company, the Journal reports that his eldest child, Delphine, has seemingly pulled out in front. However, Arnault ""has given no indication whom he will choose as his successor, saying only that it will be based on merit,"" the Journal notes, meaning that he likely still sees himself in the role for the foreseeable future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999885559082031}",neutral,0.9999885559082031,0
