One of the sources told Bloomberg that LVMH is competing against other bidders for the property. The landlord of the building is Paramount Group.

LVMH is the latest luxury brand to seek to own a piece of Manhattan’s Fifth Ave. Last week Globest.com reported that Kering, the French luxury group that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, acquired the retail portion of 715-717 Fifth Ave., for $963 million.

LVMH shares jump over 12% as earnings point to luxury sector resilience - CNBC,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjYvbHZtaC1zaGFyZXMtanVtcC04cGVyY2VudC1hcy1lYXJuaW5ncy1wb2ludC10by1sdXh1cnktc2VjdG9yLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzAxLzI2L2x2bWgtc2hhcmVzLWp1bXAtOHBlcmNlbnQtYXMtZWFybmluZ3MtcG9pbnQtdG8tbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci1yZXNpbGllbmNlLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, speaks during a press conference to present the 2023 annual results of LVMH in Paris, France, January 25, 2024.

LVMH shares jumped more than 12% on Friday morning, after the world's largest luxury group posted higher-than-expected sales for 2023 and raised its annual dividend.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, as well as brands including Givenchy, Bulgari and Sephora, on Thursday night reported sales amounting to 86.15 billion euros ($93.34 billion) for 2023, exceeding consensus forecasts and equating to 13% organic growth from the previous year.

Organic revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter.

The result was boosted in particular by 14% annual growth in the critical fashion and leather goods sector, along with 11% growth in perfumes and cosmetics. Wines and spirits meanwhile posted a 4% decline.

The Paris-listed stock provisionally closed Friday's session nearly 13% higher.

""Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,"" Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement.

""While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams.""

After a boom during the pandemic, the luxury sector endured a rough end to 2023 as challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions weighed on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S. and China.

LVMH in April 2023 became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value, but a share price decline over the last six months allowed it to be eclipsed as Europe's largest company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

British luxury brand Burberry earlier this month issued a profit warning in response to slowing demand, as the balloon in high-end spending that peaked during the pandemic loses air. At the time, the news sent Burberry shares plunging and dragged down the wider sector.

Yet luxury stocks broadly advanced on Thursday as investors took heart from LVMH's reassuring results. Burberry's own shares were up 1.7% Friday morning.

Javier Gonzalez Lastra, portfolio manager of the Tema Luxury ETF, told CNBC on Thursday that investors are trying to gauge where the bottom of the earnings cycle revision is for the luxury sector. He predicted that earnings are ""likely to get tougher"" through the first half of 2024 because of last year's unusually high annual comparisons.

Arnault, however, is pinning some hope on LVMH's partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympics, which he said ""provides a new opportunity to reinforce our global leadership position in luxury goods and promote France's reputation for excellence around the world."
LVMH Sees Strong Growth With Kohl's-Sephora Partnership - PYMNTS.com,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyNC9sdm1oLXNlZXMtc3Ryb25nLWdyb3d0aC13aXRoLWtvaGxzLXNlcGhvcmEtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods giant LVMH, best known for brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany, reported a 10% surge in sales for the fourth quarter on Thursday (Jan. 25), outpacing the previous quarter. The momentum was fueled by robust demand, notably from Chinese consumers, who favored its high-end fashion items during the crucial year-end period.

According to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, products at the highest tier have the highest global demand, with haute couture items from labels like Christian Dior leading the way.

Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony reported that Louis Vuitton enjoyed an upswing from wealthy Chinese consumers in Europe, hitting 70% of the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.

While the conglomerate observed resilient luxury goods shoppers, it also gained momentum in its “selective retailing” segment, courtesy of Sephora.

The selective retailing segment, with Sephora and duty-free airport mainstay DFS, strong growth was mainly driven by “exceptional” momentum at Sephora, according to Arnault, particularly from Sephora’s partnership with Kohl’s. Revenue in this segment saw the highest increase across the conglomerate, surging by 25% to nearly €18 billion.

Arnault was content with LVMH’s growth rate and conveyed a high level of confidence in the outlook for 2024.

The company achieved sales of nearly $26 billion in the last quarter of the year.

Sephora and Kohl’s

While Arnault highlighted the partnership as a key asset to its selective retailing performance, Kohl’s has also found the partnership to be beneficial.

In November, the department store mentioned that the collaboration was great for sales, and it is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue by the year 2025.

“The partnership with Sephora is phenomenal,” said Kohl’s CEO Tom Kingsbury said on an earnings call Nov. 21. “And we really feel that the numbers we put out there will be achievable in the near future.”

During the quarter, Kohl’s saw a total beauty sales increase of over 70%.

Luxury Sector Landscape

Luxury goods conglomerates like LVMH and Richemont, the proprietor of Cartier, have demonstrated resilience in the face of a downturn in consumer spending.

According to a PYMNTS report, Richemont announced a sales increase of 8% year over year for the quarter ending on Dec. 31, reaching $6.1 billion. The growth was propelled by demand in China, Hong Kong and Macau, increasing 25%, along with 18% growth in Japan.

Despite facing challenges in the U.S. market, Richemont saw an increase in sales, bucking the overall slowdown witnessed by industry counterparts in the region and mitigating a decline in Europe.

Richemont’s focus on the higher-priced hard luxury sector shielded it from a downturn in aspirational and middle-class consumer spending, a factor that hurt luxury sales at other firms.

Conversely, competitors targeting lower price points, like Burberry in the U.K., encountered difficulties. The British brand attributed its lackluster financial performance to a decline in luxury sales during the holiday season.

“We are continuing to deliver the transition to our new modern British luxury creative expression for Burberry which started appearing in our stores in early autumn,” Jonathan Akeroyd, CEO, said in a Friday (Jan. 12).

Neiman Marcus, facing the luxury market slowdown, saw a small drop in holiday sales compared to last year. Even with challenges in the upscale market and careful shoppers, the company was happy with the results, considering the impact of widespread retail promotions on profit margins.

While certain consumers have cut back on luxury spending, brands like Hugo Boss have chosen to focused on attracting millennials and Generation Z shoppers are reaping the rewards.

“We ended 2023 on a high note, making it a record year for Hugo Boss,” CEO Daniel Grieder said on Jan. 16. “The double-digit top and bottom-line improvements in the final quarter are all the more remarkable considering the current challenging global market environment.”

LVMH by the Numbers

“Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” Arnault said in a press release.

“Our growth strategy, based on the complementary nature of our businesses, as well as their geographic diversity, encourages innovation, high-quality design and retail excellence, and adds a cultural and historical dimension thanks to the heritage of our Maisons.”

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported revenue of €86.2 billion in 2023, reflecting 13% organic growth compared to 2022. All business groups reported organic revenue growth, except for Wines & Spirits, which faced challenges due to a high basis of comparison and high inventory levels. Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia achieved double-digit organic growth. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 10%.

Profit from recurring operations stood at €22.8 billion for 2023, an increase of 8%. The operating margin remained stable compared to 2022. Group share of net profit amounted to €15.2 billion, up 8%."

Arnault’s nomination of sons Alexandre, 31, and Frederic, 29, could come as early as this week, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming a report from online publication La Lettre. LVMH is due to announce annual results on Thursday.

The board nominations would then be subject to a vote at the company’s annual general meeting in April. A spokesman for LVMH declined to comment.

The appointments would underscore the family’s firm grip on LVMH. Arnault and his family own about 48% of LVMH shares and nearly 64% of voting rights.

Arnault, 74, is the world’s third-wealthiest person, with a fortune of about $161 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s been grooming his children in a variety of roles at the company as he develops a succession plan.

All five of Arnault’s children work at the firm. Delphine, 48, is chief executive officer of Christian Dior Couture, the group’s second-biggest fashion label after Louis Vuitton. She’s the only Arnault child to currently sit on LVMH’s executive committee.

Antoine Arnault, 46, is responsible for LVMH’s image and communications and is a non-executive chairman of cashmere specialist Loro Piana, which belongs to the company. He is also vice chairman and CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company through which the Arnault family controls LVMH. Both Delphine and Antoine became board members before the age of 30.

The billionaire founder’s three youngest sons came via his second marriage, to Canadian concert pianist Helene Mercier. Alexandre has overseen product and communications at Tiffany & Co. for the past three years while Frederic runs the group’s watch unit, which includes labels such as Hublot, Tag Heuer and Zenith. Jean, 25, is in charge of developing Louis Vuitton’s watch category.

In 2022, Arnault lifted the age limit for his CEO role to 80. LVMH last week announced that his close lieutenant Sidney Toledano, 72, will step down from the executive committee."

That’s the conclusion of an ever-growing list of studies that show companies with a socially diverse workforce are more innovative, productive, and boast better financial performance.

LVMH, the world's leader in luxury goods, is a case in point.

Counting among its 196,000-strong workforce more than 190 nationalities and people from four generations in over 80 countries, LVMH's luxury goods empire includes 75 prestigious brands (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Loewe, Guerlain and Dom Perignon), more than 3,000 stores, and reported sales of €79.2 billion in 2022

Not to mention ranking first in the CAC 40 stock market index by market valuation and in the top 20 of the world's largest companies.

Its Founder, Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault is the second wealthiest person in the world – with an estimated net worth of US$200.7 billion, per Forbes.

While the success of LVMH is based upon numerous factors – diversity is at the heart of the French conglomerate, with a business model marked by a creative and long-term momentum to develop its 75 Maisons as ‘distinctive identities’.

Similarly, this is how LVMH treats its people too.

‘People make the difference’ underscores the approach the Group takes to everything, from guiding the Group’s HR policy to its choice of suppliers, retailers and partners.

Seeing diversity and cross-fertilisation of perspectives as a tremendous source of creativity and performance, LVMH strongly believes in people’s uniqueness, in their talent, and singularity, whatever their background, and values the differences of perspectives that make the business more innovative.

Among DEI goals, LVMH is looking to these workforce targets by 2025:

50% Women in Group Key Positions and Pay Equity

30% Black, Indigenous and People of Colour in key positions in North America"

Burke succeeds Sidney Toledano, who is now appointed personal advisor to CEO Bernard Arnault and leaves the group’s executive committee. The changes will take effect Feb. 1, 2024.

“Sidney Toledano is an exceptional leader who has been at my side for many years, first at Dior and then at LVMH Fashion Group,” Arnault said. “During more than 30 years of a close and beneficial collaboration, he has identified and fostered many creative talents who are now among the world’s most recognized designers. With his unique strategic vision, he has played a key role in making Dior one of the world’s most prestigious maisons. As head of LVMH fashion group, his creative leadership has contributed to the spectacular growth of our fashion houses, which have benefited from his deep expertise to strengthen their desirability.”

Arnault then confirmed that Toledano will remain “very involved” as his advisor. “He still has much to offer.”

Toledano recalled in a statement that when he joined Dior and led the brand for 20 years, Arnault gave him an unparalleled chance to be part of the company with a long-term vision and an entrepreneurial venture with a family at its base. “My time in the LVMH Group was the experience that stimulated and enriched me the most in my entire career. Partly because I was surrounded by talented designers, exceptional artisans, and teams with a remarkable dedication to their craft,” Toledano said. “I share with Bernard Arnault a passion for innovation, creativity, excellence and savoir-faire, and it is thanks to him, to his bold vision, that today the LVMH Group is a global leader.”

Toledano went on to call his successor Burke an exceptionally experienced, universally recognized manager with great energy. He reiterated that he will not disappear from the scene, while also remaining involved in the fashion industry through the IFM (Institut Français de la Mode) and the executive committee of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.

Arnault also commented on the appointment of the group’s new chairman, “After guiding Louis Vuitton to new levels of success, I am delighted to see Michael Burke at the head of the fashion group. He has been at my side since before the creation of LVMH, and always been a key player in the group’s success, especially through his remarkable discernment and finesse at the helm of Bulgari, Fendi and Louis Vuitton. These fashion houses have continued to grow and evolve while remaining true to their heritage and unique savoir-faire.”

Arnault, the luxury giant’s founder, stressed under Burke’s 10-year leadership at Louis Vuitton, the brand has become the largest and most prestigious fashion house in the world, placing culture at the center of its creative vision and development. “His vast experience and passion for craftsmanship and creativity are invaluable assets to pursue and further accelerate the dynamic growth of other fashion houses,” he concluded.

“I am proud and honored by Bernard Arnault’s trust in me after 40 years of collaboration,” said Burke. “This is an exciting challenge. Like him and like Sidney Toledano himself, I am a great believer in long-term vision, craftsmanship, creativity and excellence. All basic ingredients in the recipe that I want to apply to the teams and the brands, whose desirability I intend to elevate by achieving new record results. Sidney and I have worked together and are also friends, having shared over 30 years,” he adds. “What he has done is impressive for the fashion houses whose magic and ability to innovate, starting from a unique history and savoir-faire, I plan to further strengthen.”"

The buying spree helped recoup some of last year’s losses after China’s economic revival proved lacklustre following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.

Shares in LVMH jumped as much as 11 percent, adding about $30 billion to its own stock market value and boosting peers of the French luxury giant including Kering and Hermès.

That helped lift the pan-European STOXX 600 index to its highest level in two years.

LVMH, home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Moet Hennessy and Tiffany & Co, posted a 10 percent rise in fourth-quarter sales on Thursday, driven by resilient demand for its high-end fashion over the end-of-year trading period.

Investors had grown skittish about the industry’s prospects following LVMH’s previous report in October which showed its sales growth slowed to 9% after a long spell of routinely outpacing expectations with strong double-digit growth.

At a results presentation on Thursday, LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said he was happy with the company’s current growth rate.

With its latest report, LVMH “reassured — and coped nicely with a sharp slowdown in sales momentum” in the second half, Jefferies analyst James Grzinic wrote in a note to clients, adding the report should “steady nerves in the near term”.

Chinese Demand

Appetite from Chinese shoppers for European fashion brands has been a key source of concern for investors in recent months, as a property crisis and high youth unemployment dashed hopes for a strong rebound, while the return of travelling Chinese beyond Asia has been slower than initially expected.

Executives at LVMH said it was hard to measure Chinese demand as they have begun travelling outside of mainland China to places like Hong Kong and Macau, but noted that the group has twice as many Chinese customers as it did in 2019.

“We’re not particularly concerned,” said LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony.

While large bus loads of Chinese customers are no longer arriving in Europe, the group is doing brisk business with wealthier Chinese customers, with LVMH’s biggest label LVMH reaching sales levels with Chinese in France and Europe of 70 percent of 2019 levels.

The luxury goods industry had come to rely on fast growth in China, where over the span of five years, from 2017 to 2021, the luxury market tripled in size, according to Bain.

Chinese luxury consumption is expected to reach 35-40 percent of the world’s total, with mainland China one of the leading global markets reaching a 24-26 percent share by 2030, according to Bain.

As the sector comes down from the high paced growth seen after the pandemic, the diverging fortunes of brands has come into view, with those catering to wealthier clients, like Hermès, better equipped for economic challenges than those pursuing turnarounds, like Burberry, which issued a profit warning earlier this month.

But shares of Burberry also traded higher on Friday, up 2.9 percent.

LVMH was the top gainer on the euro-zone blue-chip STOXX50E index.

Friday’s gains added about $70 billion to the value of the top luxury and drinks companies, including LVMH, Gucci-owner Kering, Hermès, Pernod, Remy, Cartier-owner Richemont and Moncler, according to Reuters calculations.

Wines & Spirits: Contrasting trends across different markets following an exceptional year in 2022

The Wines & Spirits business group saw a revenue decline (-4% organic) in 2023, faced with a particularly high basis of comparison. Profit from recurring operations was down 2%. Driven by its value strategy, the champagne business posted growth, with a good performance in Europe and Japan offsetting the effects of an unfavorable macroeconomic environment in the United States. Hennessy cognac was affected by a mixed recovery in China and by the post-Covid normalization of demand in the United States, while efforts continued to maintain optimal inventory levels among retailers. In Provence rosé wines, LVMH acquired the prestigious Minuty estate, the second-largest market player after Château d’Esclans, which also continued its international development.

Fashion & Leather Goods: Exceptional performances by Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Loro Piana, Loewe, Rimowa and Marc Jacobs

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 14% in 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 7%. Louis Vuitton had an excellent year, once again buoyed by the creativity and quality of its products, and by its strong ties to art and culture. Many new designs were unveiled, including the GO-14 leather goods line and the new Tambour watch, a fusion of Swiss watchmaking expertise and Louis Vuitton’s Parisian elegance. Nicolas Ghesquière, who celebrated his 10th anniversary designing the Maison’s Women’s collections and renewed his contract for a further five years, continued to captivate audiences with his boundless creativity. Set on the stage of the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris in July, the first fashion show of the new Creative Director of Menswear Pharrell Williams sparked enthusiasm worldwide. Christian Dior continued to deliver remarkable growth in all its product lines. Giving center stage to excellent craftsmanship, fashion shows curated by Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones reinvented the magic of the Dior name, season after season. Victoire de Castellane’s creative verve was once again on full display in her new high jewelry collection, Les Jardins de la Couture. The year ended on a high note, with a spectacular Dior display at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, whose facade was bedecked with a captivating “Carousel of Dreams” and 24 enchanting window displays. Celine continued to enhance its desirability, driven by the success of Hedi Slimane’s designs and fashion shows. Loewe’s robust growth continued to be driven by J.W. Anderson’s bold, creative leadership and by the success of the latest new leather goods designs. Loro Piana confirmed its superb momentum and its leadership position in ultra-premium, sophisticated luxury. Fendi expanded its retail network. Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti all turned in an excellent performance.

Perfumes & Cosmetics: Excellent momentum in fragrances and makeup

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group posted organic revenue growth of 11% in 2023 thanks to its highly selective retail policy and dynamic innovation strategy, backed by the scientific excellence of LVMH’s research center. Profit from recurring operations was up 8%. Christian Dior achieved a remarkable performance, extending its lead in its key markets. Fragrances were once again buoyed by the success of iconic scents Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’adore, which was enriched with Francis Kurkdjian’s latest creation, L’Or de J’adore. Makeup (with Dior Addict) and skincare (with Prestige and L’Or de Vie) also contributed to the Maison’s growth. Guerlain continued to grow, driven by the popularity of its Aqua Allegoria line and its L’Art et la Matière high-end fragrance collection, as well as the excellent response to its Terracotta Le Teint makeup. Parfums Givenchy benefited from its fragrances’ ongoing success. Benefit was buoyed by its The Porefessional skincare line, while Fenty Beauty posted robust growth, driven in particular by one of its latest innovations in mascara.

Watches & Jewelry: Rapid growth in jewelry and further innovation in watches

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of 7% in 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 7%. Tiffany & Co. embarked on a new chapter in its history with the reopening of “The Landmark” in New York. Substantially raising the bar for jewelry retail worldwide, the spectacular transformation of this legendary flagship store was exceptionally well received. The new Lock collection, which continued to be rolled out worldwide, was a huge success, and Blue Book: Out of the Blue – the new high jewelry collection designed by Creative Director for Jewelry Nathalie Verdeille – was unveiled. Bulgari posted strong growth, driven by high jewelry, in particular the success of the Mediterranea collection. Its iconic Serpenti line, which celebrated its 75th anniversary, turned in a remarkable performance, both in jewelry and in women’s watches, taking home awards at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix. Chaumet continued to channel its powerful creativity through a new high jewelry line and held its A Golden Age: 1965-1985 retrospective exhibition in the historic salons of its 12 place Vendôme location. Fred inaugurated its Fred: Jewelry Designer exhibition in South Korea, where it was a major success. In watchmaking, highlights of the year included TAG Heuer’s achievement of record-breaking revenue and its celebration of the 60th anniversary of its Carrera collection, along with Hublot’s appointment as the official timekeeper for the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia.

Selective Retailing: Exceptional performance by Sephora; DFS growth supported by the recovery in international travel

The Selective Retailing business group posted organic revenue growth of 25% in 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 76%. Sephora achieved another historic year, both in terms of sales and profit, continuing to gain market share through its distinctive, innovative range of products and services. Momentum was particularly strong in North America, Europe and the Middle East. The expansion of its store network continued, with the highly successful opening of its first two stores in the United Kingdom and the thriving collaboration with Kohl’s in the United States. Another major event during the year was the reopening of its Champs-Élysées flagship store in Paris, whose renovation reflected Sephora’s sustainability strategy, aimed at reducing the energy consumption of its sales floor area by 50%. DFS benefited from the gradual recovery in international travel and, in particular, from the return of tourists to flagship destinations Hong Kong and Macao. The Maison announced its plans to open a new Galleria on the island of Hainan in China by 2026. Le Bon Marché, which is growing steadily, continued to develop innovative concepts and benefit from a loyal French customer base as well as the return of international travelers.

Confidence for 2024

While the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, LVMH is confident in its ability to continue to grow in 2024, in the highly distinctive quality and creativity that its products offer its customers, as well as in the professionalism of its management, to stand out and gain market share. LVMH will pursue its brand development-focused strategy, underpinned by continued innovation and investment as well as an extremely exacting quest for desirability and quality in its products and their highly selective distribution.

Driven by the agility of its teams, their entrepreneurial spirit and its well-diversified presence across the geographic areas in which its customers are located, LVMH therefore enters 2024 with confidence and once again sets an objective of reinforcing its global leadership position in luxury goods.

"
Sephora's 'exceptional' 2023 drives 25% retail boost for LVMH - Cosmetics Business,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3NlcGhvcmEtcy1leGNlcHRpb25hbC0yMDIzLWRyaXZlcy0yNS1yZXRhaWwtYm9vc3QtZm9y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An “exceptional” year for LVMH's beauty retail brand Sephora is helping the group weather the downward trend in luxury.

For full-year 2023, LVMH’s revenue hit €86.2bn, a 9% increase on 2022.

Selective Retailing – the company’s second largest business after Fashion & Leather Goods – was a jewel in LVMH’s crown in 2023, growing 25% to reach €17.9bn.

This trajectory was led by Sephora, according to LVMH, which had a historic year for both sales and profit.

Momentum was said to be particularly strong in the North America, Europe and the Middle East markets.

Highlights included the much-hyped opening of its first two UK stores.

Sephora’s collaboration with Kohl’s in the US was also noted, along with the reopening of the beauty retailer’s Champs-Élysées flagship store.

Sephora continues to loom large in the public’s consciousness, with the phenomenon of ‘Sephora kids’ and the behaviour of the store’s pre-teen fans recently going viral.

Hong Kong-based luxury travel retailer DFS – also under LVMH’s Selective Retailing business – benefited from the recovery in international travel, especially the return of tourists to flagship destinations Hong Kong and Macao.

Under its Perfumes & Cosmetics business umbrella, LVMH said it saw “particularly strong” momentum in fragrances and make-up across all regions, boosted by its men’s fragrance Dior’s Sauvage, which was the world’s best-selling scent last year.

The business segment posted organic revenue growth of 11% for the year, reaching €8.3bn.

In addition to Sauvage, LVMH credited other Dior big-hitters Miss Dior and J’adore – including perfumer Francis Kurkdjian’s latest creation for the brand, L’Or de J’adore – with fuelling growth.

Fenty Beauty in make-up was likewise said to have posted robust growth, driven in particular by its 2023 launch Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara.

LVMH’s 2023 figures suggest it is weathering the drop in luxury spend in key markets such as the US, Europe and China as the post-pandemic spending spree wears off, more successfully than its rivals.

Its performance outstripped prestige brand-owners like Kering (which saw group revenue decline 13% in Q3 2023 – its most recently reported results) and Estée Lauder Companies, for whom net sales decreased 10% in fiscal 2024.

However, it is not fully immune; LVMH’s growth last year was at a significantly slower pace than the 23% increase it achieved in 2022."
Weekend Briefing: LVMH expects a positive bump from the U.S. election - Glossy,"Sun, 28 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3dlZWtlbmQtYnJpZWZpbmctbHZtaC1leHBlY3RzLWEtcG9zaXRpdmUtYnVtcC1mcm9tLXRoZS11LXMtZWxlY3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, LVMH’s earnings report showed the company bucking the trend of slowing luxury sales. CEO Bernard Arnault said he expects the U.S. election this year to further boost the company’s revenue. Don’t forget to subscribe to the Glossy Podcast for interviews with fashion industry leaders and Week in Review episodes, and the Glossy Beauty Podcast for interviews from the beauty industry. –Danny Parisi, sr. fashion reporter

The last few months have been hard on the luxury market, with major companies like Kering and Saks Fifth Avenue struggling with lowered demand for luxury goods from consumers around the world.

But LVMH finally bucked that trend with its latest earnings report released on Thursday. It reported revenue of over $93 billion for 2023, beating analyst estimates. That’s an increase of 13% over the year prior, with a 14% boost in the fashion and leather goods segment.

During the earnings call, CEO Bernard Arnault praised many of the designers of LVMH’s brands, particularly Pharrell Williams who started as the creative director for the company’s best-performing brand, Louis Vuitton, last year. He said he’s happy with the growth across the group and seemed unperturbed by the slowdown currently affecting much of the sector.

“So I’m not going to dwell too long on all the brands because there are many that are successful,” Arnault said. “Great success for Celine driven by Hedi Slimane that is now topping €2 billion [or $2.2 billion] in sales. Also for Loewe. Fendi is continuing to grow from strength to strength, and Loro Piana is posting very high growth rates. To my mind, it’s overly high. We need to put the brakes on a bit because I’m often told about growth rates, ‘Why are you only delivering 8-9%?’ Well, I find that’s pretty good. And I hope that we won’t exceed that. I’d rather grow slow than push.”

Arnault also spoke confidently about the company’s prospects for 2024, citing several new initiatives coming up like Louis Vuitton’s reinvention of its watch category. Interestingly, he also said the upcoming U.S. election may present a good opportunity for LVMH and luxury, in general.

“We expect a positive impact in the U.S. from the coming election,” Arnault said. “Every time there’s an election in the U.S., the market is more dynamic. So we expect the U.S. market to be more dynamic in 2024 than it was in 2023.”

That dynamism needs to come back for the U.S. luxury market to recover. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony noted that the U.S. was among the hardest-hit markets for LVMH last year.

“The United States had a challenging year,” he said on the call. “It ended up well enough, better than it started. Q2 and Q3 had little growth, but there was some acceleration in Q4, and that’s not just because of Sephora, even though Sephora enjoyed significant growth.”

Arnault said he’s confident that the demand will return. Whether that only holds true for LVMH or extends to the rest of the luxury category remains to be seen.

“I expect to continue the growth that was achieved in 2023,” Arnault said. “The market went through a [rough] period, and we’ll see during the course of the year the effect of the interest rates decline that will kick in.”"
"LVMH, TikTok team up to counter fake luxury goods - Jing Daily","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXRpa3Rvay1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1jb3VudGVyZmVpdC1sdXh1cnktcHJvZHVjdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is reportedly in discussions with TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to address concerns about the sale of fake luxury products on the world’s top short video-sharing platform.

The app is popular across all age demographics in selling and recommending “dupes,” a hashtag referring to cheaper, duplicate products that currently has 6.6 billion views . The trend is massively contributing to the issue of counterfeits, as recognized by the luxury conglomerate LVMH.

From beauty products by Benefit to Louis Vuitton bags, many items sold by vendors on TikTok are actually counterfeits. This not only tarnishes the reputations of these luxury brands but also adversely impacts the sales of their official products.

Toto Haba, Senior Vice President of Global Omni-Marketing for Benefit Cosmetics, an LVMH-owned brand, shared insights into talks with TikTok, emphasizing that both companies aim to “set the right guardrails.” The app is already flagging apparent counterfeit products to the company.

Given LVMH's existing collaboration with Alibaba Group for its Tmall marketplace, a potential partnership with TikTok could further enhance the platform's credibility within the B2B luxury fashion sector.

The discussions align with TikTok's ambitious goal of reaching $17.5 billion in US e-commerce business by 2024, as reported by Bloomberg.

LVMH considers these discussions pivotal in safeguarding intellectual property, especially in light of TikTok Shop's ongoing integration and expansion initiatives, shedding light on the ongoing complexities faced by online marketplaces in the B2B luxury fashion landscape."

LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that owns Sephora alongside major fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, reported earnings Thursday. Good stuff! Revenue in 2023 was up 10% from the year before to 86 billion euros ($93 billion). And although the company never says how much any one of its individual companies are doing financially, it does like to drop in the occasional phrase cluing investors into how things are faring: Louis Vuitton had “another excellent year,” perfume brand Guerlain merely “continued its growth,” and in the watches and jewelry category, where business was flat, Tiffany & Co. “embarked on a new chapter in its 187-year history with the reopening of its legendary New York flagship.”

For “selective retailing,” the department that houses Sephora and duty-free airport mainstay DFS, “strong growth was mainly driven by exceptional momentum at Sephora.” Revenue rose the most of any other section of the empire, up 25% to nearly 18 billion euros. On the earnings call itself, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said that the brand “managed to exceed all our forecasts.”

Last year, a survey of young shoppers from investment bank Piper Sandler found that Sephora had unseated its competitor Ulta as their favorite beauty destination the first time in five years.

In a display of resilience, LVMH saw its shares surge by over 8 percent on Friday morning. This leap came in the wake of the group announcing its 2023 sales, which not only surpassed analyst forecasts but also showcased an impressive 13 percent organic growth from the previous year, reaching a staggering $93.34 billion (86.15 billion euros) in revenue.

The luxury behemoth, which houses esteemed brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët & Chandon, Hennessy, Givenchy, Loewe, Tiffany & Co., Bulgari, and Sephora, reported a commendable 10 percent rise in organic revenue in the fourth quarter alone.

A notable 14 percent annual growth in the crucial fashion and leather goods sector bolstered these figures, alongside an 11 percent uptick in the perfumes and cosmetics segment. However, the wines and spirits division saw a 4 percent decline.

The Jing Take

The luxury sector, which experienced a surge during the pandemic, faced a challenging 2023, with macroeconomic slowdown in key markets like China and the US, as well as global geopolitical unrest.

Despite these headwinds, LVMH's fashion and leather goods division, which includes industry stalwarts like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Celine, secured greater global market share, reaching unprecedented revenue and profit heights.

The performance was boosted by sales in Asia, including China, which accounts for 31 percent of the conglomerate's total sales. Despite the shadow of the pandemic, LVMH has doubled its Chinese clientele since 2019, prompting iconic brands in the group to increase their footprint in the country.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH who was also momentarily the world's richest man in 2023, remarked yesterday on the group's reliance: “Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” he stated.

Arnault singled out: “Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior’s spectacular fashion shows, Tiffany’s reopening of ‘The Landmark’ in New York, and the ever-growing popularity of Sephora’s store concept worldwide” were strategic milestones that helped boost performance last year.

Arnault also emphasized the group's strategy of “geographic diversity,” its diverse product sectors, “retail excellence,” and the “cultural and historical dimension thanks to the heritage of our Maisons,” as key factors for growth.

Dior's Sauvage reaffirmed its status as the world's top-selling fragrance in 2023, underscoring a high-performing year for beauty and fragrances, while Tag Heuer, Tiffany & Co. drove hard luxury inroads.

This year has been big for LVMH. From being the first European company to break the 400 billion euro market barrier to the group's executive reshuffles, along with expansion into China's beauty R&D sector and thoughtful localized activities among its brands, there's been much effort made to stay in luxury consumers' good graces.

With Louis Vuitton's global Kusama activations and Chinese New Year dragon sculptures, coupled with the onboarding of Pharrell Williams to lead the brand's menswear, it has been a year filled with positive headlines for key labels in LVMH's portfolio.

Luxury Briefing: LVMH men's shows are heavy in handbags as leather goods sales slow - Glossy,"Sat, 20 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2x1eHVyeS9sdXh1cnktYnJpZWZpbmctbHZtaHMtbWVucy1zaG93cy1hcmUtaGVhdnktaW4taGFuZGJhZ3MtYXMtbGVhdGhlci1nb29kcy1zYWxlcy1zbG93L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, a look at why designer brands are betting big on men’s handbags. Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments, giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.

From paparazzi shots to runway shows, more men are being seen carrying handbags. It could be the Jacob Elordi effect, but there’s a good chance it’s brands’ attempt to expand their customer base as sales of luxury goods slow.

The men’s fall 2024 shows, currently rolling out in Paris, have been heavy in handbags. That’s especially true of shows by brands owned by LVMH, which in October reported a quarterly revenue increase for its fashion and leather goods division of 9% year-over-year. That fell short of analysts’ expectations of 10–11% growth.

For example, out of the 81 looks in Pharrell’s fall 2024 men’s show for Louis Vuitton, which played out on Tuesday, 73 featured a handbag or trunk. And of those, three featured multiple bag styles. Out of the eight looks styled without a bag or trunk, three featured an alternative leather accessory, such as a bound notebook or a held pair of gloves.

Meanwhile, every look in the show of LVMH-owned Fendi seemed to feature a bag or two, though a few proved to be portable speakers created in collaboration with Devialet Mania. And 25 of Dior Homme’s 60 looks featured bags – again, some multiple. Bags were also seen in around 38 of Kenzo’s 61 looks, 10 of Givenchy’s 34 and 21 of Loewe’s 55, excluding a repeated waist pouch that mimicked the base of a hoodie. LVMH, which reports its full-year 2023 earnings on Thursday, did not comment on time for this story.

Overall, according to Bain, growth in the luxury leather goods market slowed in 2023, to 3-4%, after overperformance in recent years. Sales volumes decreased for the first time in the decade, with the growth being owed to price increases.

LVMH isn’t the only company pushing men’s bags for fall 2024. Among Kering brands, 38 of 56 looks in last week’s Gucci show featured bags. In its most recent earnings report, in October, Kering reported a disappointing decline in its overall quarterly sales, of 9% year-over-year. Prada, meanwhile, featured bags in 12 of 49 looks, and nearly half of Giorgio Armani’s 81 looks were accessorized with a crossbody bag or duffel.

Handbags showing up in menswear shows is nothing new, but the growing number is significant. For its part, LVMH has gradually increased their presence, showing bags in 56 of 69 men’s looks for fall 2023 and 63 of 71 for spring 2024. And merchandising-out a runway lineup has been done, but we’re arguably approaching peak accessories. See: Balenciaga’s co-ed December 2 show, overflowing with branded water bottles, coffee cups, phone cases, sunglasses and totes in the style of Erewhon shopping bags.

The jumbo size of many of the new men’s bags is also worth noting, seeing as bigger bags typically come with a higher price tag. The trend took shape via styles introduced at the shows of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, JW Anderson, Fendi, S.S.Daley and Zegna, among others.

Brands’ efforts to sell men’s bags have been working, though the impact on their bottom line has remained minimal. According to Beth Goldstein, footwear and fashion accessories analyst at Circana, sales of men’s bags — including handbags, totes, slings and fanny packs — grew 6% year-over-year in 2023, following double-digit growth in the two years prior. Compared to 2019, the category’s sales in 2023 were nearly double.

But, she noted, “this is a very small market,” driving less than 1% of the sales volume of the women’s bag market. And unit sales have declined, with price increases driving the growth to date. Designer bags are the largest and highest growth segment of the men’s bag market, she said.

“The growth is driven by a few factors, including the acceptance of handbags being carried by men and the availability of more gender-neutral styles,” Goldstein said. “Also, slimmer men’s pants cuts mean they can’t necessarily fit everything in their pockets.”

Along with Elordi, who seems to favor styles by Kering’s Bottega Veneta and LVMH’s Celine, the well-accessorized men fueling the trend include A$AP Rocky, Bad Bunny and the many athletes who have made a fashion statement out of cradling a designer dopp kit on game day.

“The rise of men’s bags post-pandemic is equivalent to the rise of women’s novelty bags; people are being bolder and taking more risks [with their style],” said Emily Blumenthal, founder of the Handbag Awards and industry expert. She credited men’s newfound comfort level with carrying bags to their recently adopted habit of expressing themselves through their choice of sneakers. And, she added, “The crazed trend of the genderless Lululemon belt bag has given license to many men who wouldn’t have historically worn a bag at all.”

But, as for the men’s bags being paraded down recent runways, according to fashion commentator Hanan Besovic, the brands behind them may simply be tapping into a marketing opportunity and not targeting men at all. “They don’t read as menswear only,” he said in an Instagram video about the bags at Louis Vuitton. “If the strategy for Louis Vuitton menswear accessories is to cater to women, that’s actually pretty smart; that would be very lucrative.”"
Weekend Briefing: Can Frédéric Arnault reshape LVMH's watch division? - Glossy,"Sun, 07 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3dlZWtlbmQtYnJpZWZpbmctY2FuLWZyZWRlcmljLWFybmF1bHQtcmVzaGFwZS1sdm1ocy13YXRjaC1kaXZpc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frédéric Arnault, the second-youngest son of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, took over as CEO of LVMH Watches last week as the company seeks to become a major player in the space. Don’t forget to subscribe to the Glossy Podcast for interviews with fashion industry leaders and Week in Review episodes, and the Glossy Beauty Podcast for interviews from the beauty industry. -Danny Parisi, sr. fashion reporter

Last week, Frédéric Arnault, former CEO of the LVMH-owned watch brand Tag Heuer and son of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, was announced as the first CEO of the newly-formed watch division LVMH Watches. That puts Arnault in charge of not just Tag Heuer but all of LVMH’s watch brands which include Zenith and Hublot.

LVMH, and Louis Vuitton in particular, has its eyes on the lucrative and growing luxury watch market. It already has a solid footing there, but its watches are considered by most enthusiasts as “fashion watches” — high quality, but not on the same level as a high-end horological brand like Rolex or Patek Philippe. But LVMH has been meaning to change that view. Last year, it announced that it would be reshaping Louis Vuitton’s watch output by reducing the number of watch models sold and significantly increasing the price to better position its watches alongside other premium brands.

Arnault helped do exactly that at Tag Heuer where, under his leadership, he pushed the brand into higher-end territory. The $500,000 Tag Heuer Carrera watch became a hot commodity during Arnault’s time, growing to have a waitlist of over two years to get one as of this past summer. Other expensive models in the five- and six-figure range popped up during the three years Arnault was CEO of Tag Heuer, pushing the average price point of the brand’s watches above $3,000.

It seems Arnault’s mandate is now to do something similar with LVMH’s entire watch catalog. LVMH Watches is already a $2 billion business and has the backing of LVMH, with a $500 billion valuation, to invest in making its watch ambitions a reality.

But the appointment comes just as watch sales and luxury in general are slowing down. Richemont ended 2023 showing a 3% decline in quarterly sales. It owns popular Swiss watch brands including Vacheron Constantin.

A down period in watches could be the best time for LVMH to invest. When things are slow and calm, change may be better received – but it’s not a guarantee. Pushing prices higher just as sales of high-end watches are slowing and people are curbing their spending may make the transition a difficult one."
Sephora is a bright spot in LVMH 2023 earnings - Glossy,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvc2VwaG9yYS1pcy1hLWJyaWdodC1zcG90LWluLWx2bWgtMjAyMy1lYXJuaW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sephora’s power within the LVMH portfolio continues to rise.

On Thursday, LVMH shared in its 2023 year-end earnings report that selective retailing, the business unit that houses Sephora, posted a year-over-year revenue increase of 25%, to $19.4 billion, ahead of the luxury conglomerate’s four other units. Behind selective retailing was fashion & luxury goods, with a 14% year-over-year gain, and then perfumes & cosmetics, with an 11% year-over-year gain. The other selective retailers in LVMH’s portfolio are travel retailer DFS and department store Le Bon Marché. Overall, LVMH reported sales of $93.79 billion for 2023, up 13% on an organic basis from the previous year but below the 17% growth the group reported between 2021 and 2022.

LVMH singled out Sephora as having “another record-breaking year for revenue and profit,” though exact figures were not shared. The “exceptional” sales performance was across North America, Europe and the Middle East. Standout moments for Sephora in 2023 included bringing Glossier in-store in February and launching the influencer program Sephora Sounds in August. That was soon followed by updates to its loyalty program in September and the return of the consumer-facing event Sephoria in September.

In Sept. 2023, the beauty retailer announced the promotion of Artemis Patrick to CEO in North America, taking over the title in April from Jean-André Rougeot, the current president and chief executive officer, who has revealed he will retire. Priya Venkatesh, the svp of global merchandising, stepped into the global chief merchant role on Oct. 2, succeeding Patrick. Alexis Rollier, the global chief operations officer, began overseeing the Latin America region, in addition to his existing duties, effective Jan. 1. More recently, on January 22, Maggie Chan, CEO of Sephora Greater China, stepped down after five years with the company. No successor has yet been named, but the Chinese market has struggled to become a driving force for Sephora amid strong competition and a softer economic climate.

A key driver of Sephora’s success in North America is the Kohl’s at Sephora shop-in-shops. On its third-quarter earnings call in November, the Kohl’s executive team said the partnership will be a $2 billion business by 2025. There is currently a Sephora presence in over 900 Kohl’s stores, a 50% increase compared to 2022. Additionally, customers returning for additional purchases at Sephora shop 2x more often than Kohl’s-only shoppers, and 30% of the customers that shop Sephora at Kohl’s are new to Kohl’s.

“The partnership with Sephora is phenomenal. And we really feel that the numbers we put out there will be achievable in the near future,” said Tom Kingsbury, CEO of Kohl’s, during the Nov. 2023 earnings call.

In 2022, LVMH’s selective retail unit sales grew 17% year-over-year, just behind fashion & leather goods at 20%. In 2021, notably a Covid-19 recovery year for nearly every industry, selective retail posted a 16% year-over-year sales growth compared to 2020 and a decline of 18% compared to pre-Covid 2019 sales.

“While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams,” LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement."
Bernard Arnault's LVMH is stepping into 2024 with confidence as shoppers chase its highest-end products - Fortune,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjQvMDEvMjYvbHZtaC1xNC1zdXJnZS1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury’s luster seemed to be dimming in 2023 as the rich held back on lavish spending. However, some players, like LVMH, are defying economic headwinds.

The French powerhouse, home to Dior, Louis Vuitton, Sephora, and Tiffany & Co., stunned with a 10% sales surge in the final quarter of 2023, surpassing analyst forecasts.

Despite global uncertainties, the ultrawealthy are still splurging on high-end items, even in China, where luxury demand was in doubt, owing to a sluggish economy.

Now LVMH’s stellar performance is injecting fresh confidence into the luxury market.

“Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” LVMH’s billionaire CEO, Bernard Arnault, said in a statement, adding that the company was stepping into 2024 with confidence.

The optimistic tone sent LVMH’s shares up by the most in nearly two years, while other luxury company shares also rose following the earnings, including Gucci owner Kering.

Luxury industry banking on LVMH

LVMH’s performance is closely watched in the luxury sector, boasting a diverse portfolio from fashion and beauty to spirits and hotels.

The crucial fashion and leather goods segment saw a robust 9% sales uptick last quarter, while watches, jewelry, beauty, and fragrance brands also thrived. Sephora, in particular, delivered “exceptional performance” throughout 2023, according to LVMH’s earnings.

Just a few months ago, the Paris-based giant raised eyebrows with slower revenue growth in the third quarter, signaling potential shifts in the industry. This came after luxury enjoyed a significant boost from consumers’ pandemic-linked savings.

“The stock doubled between March 2020 and March 2021 and trebled to its high in April 2023, establishing the company as the real pandemic winner with very significant market share gains and raising profitability by over a third,” said Flavio Cereda, co-manager of asset management firm GAM’s luxury brands investment strategy, in a note to Fortune.

While LVMH’s fourth-quarter and 2024 outlook instills hope that it may not be gloomy for luxury this year, it also points to some pain points the industry still has to navigate.

Chinese spenders yet to fully recover

Shopping activity for Chinese shoppers in Europe at Louis Vuitton was at 70% of pre-pandemic levels, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said in a call with reporters, pointing to resilient luxury demand from Asian countries.

However, it may still be a while before Chinese spenders fully recover, given the continuing impact of travel disruptions in the country, Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst of consumer discretionary and luxury goods at Morningstar, told Fortune.

“Chinese solo tourists are starting to show up in Europe, but they don’t see the groups yet, and the groups are really the bulk of travelers,” she said, adding that backlogs in visas and uncertainty in the country’s real estate market where Chinese nationals have tied up a bulk of their savings, are also factors to consider.

“They [Chinese shoppers] do also have savings from the pandemic like people in the West had, but given the economic uncertainties … they’re a bit more reluctant to spend.”

There’s also a growing chasm between the likes of LVMH and Richemont, and their rivals offering luxury goods in a lower price range—such as Burberry—which cater to so-called aspirational consumers.

In a call with analysts, Arnault pointed to how “the highest-end products are those that have the highest demand in the world.”

Sokolova said that exposure to affluent consumers, who are more economically resilient, has been key to driving sales at brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, owned by Richemont, or the Birkin-bag maker Hermès.

Meanwhile, other entry-level brands might experience a rockier path to recovery."
Frédéric Arnault Named CEO of LVMH Watches - WWD,"Fri, 05 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZXMvZnJlZGVyaWMtYXJuYXVsdC1jZW8tbHZtaC13YXRjaGVzLXplbml0aC1odWJsb3QtdGFnLWhldWVyLXRvcm5hcmUtZGUtY2xlcmNrLTEyMzYxMDk4OTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is doubling down on watchmaking with the appointment of Frédéric Arnault as chief executive officer of LVMH Watches, a newly created role that puts him in charge of the Hublot, Tag Heuer and Zenith brands.

Unveiled Friday by the French luxury group as part of a management reshuffle of its watches and jewelry division effective since Jan. 1, the move sees Arnault pass the baton in his previous role as CEO of Tag Heuer to Julien Tornare, who had been CEO of Zenith since 2017.

Benoit de Clerck succeeds Tornare at Zenith. The executive is an industry veteran who spent 25 years at Compagnie Financière Richemont, where he was most recently chief commercial officer of Italian watchmaker Panerai.

Tornare, de Clerck and Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe will report to Arnault, who in turns will answer to LVMH Watches & Jewelry Division CEO Stéphane Bianchi.

“I am extremely pleased to have Frédéric [Arnault] join me now within the LVMH watches and jewelry division to oversee our three watches maisons, and eager to see what his unique insights and vision will bring to fuel additional and sustainable growth for them,” said Bianchi, also lauding Tornare’s track record at Zenith and de Clerck’s solid expertise.

Bianchi added that Tag Heuer had seen a “spectacular transformation” where it “recovered its credentials in record time as the luxury watch brand driven by high performance,” thanks to Arnault’s “unique and disruptive vision” of the industry and tenure of six years, including three as CEO.

While LVMH does not break out figures for its individual brands, it is understood that Tag Heuer’s turnover reached around 780 million euros in 2022 and grew by 50 percent between 2020 and 2023.

Though his Tag Heuer tenure brought “a deep transformation that is starting to bear fruit,” tangible in sales and brand equity, Arnault’s promotion comes as the watch industry gears up for a challenging 2024.

Industry sources see LVMH’s watchmakers as well-positioned, but a less buoyant demand in the final weeks of 2023 and a coming market slowdown could still make for choppy waters for the brands in his purview.

As far as Tag Heuer is concerned, “independent of market context, we have this strength that is being established that will continue to accompany us and buoy us,” he said. “2023 will be another record year for the house in terms of growth compared to 2022, which was already a record year.”

Although Arnault relinquished his role at the helm of Tag Heuer, don’t ask him quite yet about his strategy for the new watch division.

First, because the new executive wanted to take stock of the brands he knows only from an external point of view, he told WWD in an exclusive interview.

But most importantly, because he is keen to “ensure a real human and strategic continuity” for Tag Heuer. “We know how important it is for the brand today, [particularly] in this industry, to have genuine stability and long-term thinking,” he said.

So the learnings of his tenure at Tag Heuer are top of mind as Arnault emphazised he would remain highly invested.

The primary focus of his six years has been brand elevation, in his opinion. Sales progressing well “is an indicator but isn’t the only measure of success.” Brand desirability and factors such as resale price are just as, if not more, important.

Cutting out discounting was his opening gambit for the “profound culture shift” to move conversations in store from pricing to “design, icons, history,” he said.

“We have the good fortune and responsibility of having a robust heritage,” he continued. “We have the responsibility of nourishing it.”

If there is a watch family that epitomizes Arnault’s strategy, it’s the Carrera, which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2023. His personal favorite is the Carrera Skipper released in July, which “really represents the vision we had and will continue to have,” he said.

Not all of Tag Heuer’s hits were born in the previous century. Case in point: the Connected smartwatch range, which will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 2025.

“In 2015, we were the only [Swiss] watchmaker to have a connected watch,” Arnault said. Not only is the brand going to keep mining existing grooves such as wellness, sports and its highly popular golfing edition, but the smartwatch is also slated to become “the ultimate Tag Heuer watch” come January’s LVMH Watch Week in Miami, he revealed.

Its upcoming software update will include all the brand’s watch faces, and future mechanical timepieces will have a digital twin available for the connected watch.

Doubling down on its DNA also meant recapturing its reputation for innovation — TAG stands for “technique d’avant-garde” — repositioning itself so it could “afford to open doors others wouldn’t or would be scared to go for, such as lab-grown diamonds or quartz,” which underpins the solar-powered movement of its Solargraph model, according to Arnault.

Though it sits among the brand’s entry-level models with its 2,300-euro price point, that didn’t mean skimping on innovation to deliver a product he considered “one of Tag Heuer’s great successes,” he said.

And though the brand is increasingly speaking to an audience of collectors, Arnault said it was “first and foremost speaking to a clientele who wants the watch of a lifetime.”

Those customers seek “a rather reassuring design, from a reassuring brand whose product will not go out of style and will embody values long-held and that will continue for decades to come, so that’s why the notion of icons is extremely important,” he continued.

Arnault also put in the time to rebuild the brand’s communication platform, particularly cementing its partnerships to bring it closer to the worlds of sports, performance and innovation as well as cinema.

“When I joined, our connection to motorsports was fading so reinforcing it and bringing it back into the core of the brand was key to me,” he said, highlighting partnerships with Porsche and the Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team.

The move proved timely, landing Tag Heuer on the radar of a younger – and increasingly female – audience with a growing interest in cars and motorsport, in particular Formula 1 due to the popularity of hit Netflix series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.”

The watchmaker extended its partnership with Oracle Red Bull Racing in November, with the deal expected to span beyond 2030, said the executive.

Another example was teaming up with Ryan Gosling, particularly for the action-comedy “The Chase for Carrera” short film, which worked well, the executive continued.

Achieving these goals meant building a team fit for purpose. “Along with company culture, this is one of my biggest sources of pride, which also leaves the company with a very clear plan until 2027 and even 2030,” Arnault said.

Key hires included Carole Forestier-Kasapi, Tag Heuer’s movements director, but also Edouard Mignon, who piloted research and development and became chief operating officer of LVMH Swiss Manufactures. There is also the now 60-strong connected technologies team.

Investments are also underway in Tag Heuer’s production arm. First out of the gate within 18 months is the reconstruction of its watch case factory, to introduce new technologies but also scale up its output to meet the brand’s growth.

Asked if this is one area where his Tag Heuer experience and his new role will entwine to build bridges between the French group’s watchmakers, he noted that “mutualization isn’t a watchword at LVMH, which is about the autonomy of houses, entrepreneurship and creativity.”

That said, he sees potential to build or foster existing organic synergies in fields such as distribution or industrial tools, giving the example of the ArteCad watch dial manufacturer. Piloted by Tag Heuer, it also serves its LVMH stablemates as well as other brands.

However, investing in all these areas came at the cost of rising retail prices, which Arnault said had been done by introducing new products at higher price points, rather than hiking up sticker prices on existing references. Average prices rose from 1,800 euros in 2017 to hover slightly above the 3,000-euro mark today.

Retail was also reconfigured since 2019, with overall doors cut by half down to 2,300 worldwide by the end of 2023. Over the same period, stand-alone stores, either its own retail network or franchises, doubled to 300.

Arnault was also instrumental in bolstering the digital firepower of the brand, both internal and consumer-facing, in communication as well as retail. “When I joined, we developed this area with vigor because we believed in it, particularly e-commerce,” he recalled. “We have had very good results with sales online on our own site as well as retailers with whom we work closely and respect.”

Going forward, he remained cautiously confident the brand’s desirability would continue to carry it upwards, supported by its communication and product plans, which include coming introductions such as eyewear.

Among strategic projects the company will need to pursue is expansion in China, where it has “good growth levels but a penetration level that is very low compared to the territory size,” he said.

The country is “a very important reservoir of potential growth as the brand is starting to connect meaningfully with the Chinese client,” Arnault continued, expressing satisfaction at Tag Heuer’s “very strong position” in the U.S., U.K., Japan, South Korea and its reinforced one in Europe.

Australia is also a big market for the brand, he said, noting that its currently under-renovation Sydney store was among the top boutiques worldwide, alongside New York’s Fifth Avenue, Dubai and Paris flagships.

“The challenge is continuing on the track that has been traced,” he said. “The roadmap is set but execution is crucial. I trust Julien [Tornare] and the teams — and I’ll be there to accompany them.”"
"EXCLUSIVE: Michael Burke, Sidney Toledano Take New Roles at LVMH - WWD","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtZXhlY3V0aXZlLWNoYW5nZS1idXJrZS10b2xlZGFuby1uZXctcm9sZXMtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC0xMjM2MDAyNjc4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two of the fashion industry’s most accomplished and admired executives, Sidney Toledano and Michael Burke, are taking on new roles at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, WWD has learned exclusively.

Burke is to succeed Toledano at the head of LVMH Fashion Group, and with a mission that is different from 2018 when Toledano took up the role overseeing Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Emilio Pucci.

Meanwhile, Toledano will leave the LVMH executive committee and become an adviser to LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, a responsibility he will take up alongside roles at the Paris fashion school IFM, French fashion’s governing body, and family commitments.

“I am not retiring,” Toledano stressed, while citing a wish to reduce his workload and gain more personal time. “It gives me more freedom to look at the market and have a different point of view.”

The handover — Toledano called it “more a transmission than succession” — takes effect Feb. 1 and completes one of the biggest changing of the guards at LVMH in recent memory. It commenced one year ago when Burke stepped down as chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton after a stellar 10-year tenure, handing the baton to then-Dior chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari, who in turn was succeeded at Dior by Delphine Arnault. She had been Burke’s number two at Vuitton.

As Toledano and Burke settled in for an hourlong interview with WWD in a bright conference room at LVMH headquarters, a photographer at the ready for candid shots, both men rolled their office chairs to avoid the glare of sunlight that might make them squint in photos. The gesture felt like a metaphor for the enormous mutual respect between the two men — not wishing to take too much spotlight, or to leave a beloved colleague alone in the shade.

Not that they minced words about their immense esteem for each other.

“I’m coming into this job standing on the shoulders of a giant,” Burke said. “How do I build upon this incredible success story that Sidney has written over these last years?”

For his part, Toledano said he couldn’t be happier to hand the baton to Burke.

“Who else?” he asked rhetorically, for indeed Burke was the natural candidate to take up the high-profile, multifaceted position. “Yes, he has the experience. Yes, we are friends, and more than that.…We know what the other is thinking without even talking.”

Michael Burke Thomas Chéné/WWD

Yet beyond Burke’s experience, and his past successes leading Vuitton, Fendi and Bulgari, Toledano said he’s right for the job “because Michael can do it, and he will have challenges. I told him, ‘Michael, we still have a lot of potential and this mission is for you.'”

To be sure, both men have a solid track record of catapulting companies to new heights and profitable growth, and a strong capacity to interface with creative talents and managers alike.

According to market sources, revenues at the LVMH Fashion Group more than doubled since Toledano took over the division in 2018, with profits multiplying more than eight times.

The chief engines of the growth have been Celine, Loewe and Marc Jacobs, the same sources said.

Burke and Toledano echoed each other in stressing that all brands in the LVMH Fashion Group have enormous development potential, some requiring longer time horizons than others.

And they both agreed that leading them to greatness will require a different approach.

Providing a glimpse of his vision for the LVMH Fashion Group, Burke cited an ambition to make it the industry’s preeminent internal talent pool for creatives and managers — and a place for more risk-taking.

“The second phase of this will be more people-centric because we now have houses that can actually take risks,” Burke said.

Indeed, he characterized the LVMH Fashion Group as “a platform that can be used differently than when Sidney joined because he had to build some of the foundations.”

“A number of the Fashion Group houses now have enough depth and enough heft to be more into risk-taking when it comes to people. That means hiring people, training them and getting them ready for the biggest jobs in the group,” he said.

Does that foretell a host of high-level changes at brands under his purview?

“Not more than necessary,” Burke replied with a smile. “We don’t reposition all brands simultaneously. There is a certain amount of sequencing so that we can do it in depth.

“At any given time, there’s one or two houses that are in need of repositioning, rebuilding, re-dimensioning or redirecting, and with what Sidney has achieved, we now have more freedom to do that.”

In his view, the brands under his purview will need more TLC, of the bespoke variety.

“When you’re in a group as successful as LVMH, you can become a little risk-adverse, because we have a number of formulas that work. And we can at times fall back too much on formulas. What will make these houses successful is remaining true to their iconic status, remaining true to their origins, remaining true to the specificities of each house,” Burke explained.

It is understood Burke’s stable of brands will be expanded to include Fendi, where he was CEO from 2003 to 2012, setting it on an impressive growth trajectory and proving his ability to immerse himself deeply into the culture of a brand and build strong business pillars around it.

In the interview, the executive stressed that design, communication, manufacturing and distribution must be controlled directly by each LVMH maison. “And I will fight like a devil to make sure that the Fashion Group houses will have customized, bespoke tools at their disposition,” he said, stressing, “It’s not about scalability, it’s about uniqueness. It’s about creating unique desires, and unique ways of communicating.”

In Burke’s estimation, the “three enemies” of business success are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency.

By contrast, he argued that LVMH companies “are always managed with a very positive energy that tomorrow will be better. That’s our fundamental value. We like to have fun, and we’re very passionate about what we do. We don’t aim for the average — we aim high, we aim far into the future.”

Both men frequently lauded Jonathan Anderson’s masterful reinvention of Loewe, whose revenues are believed to be approaching 2 billion euros, fueled by the designer’s daring designs and storytelling built around craft in fashion, film, art and more.

“He came up with an entirely different way of communicating that really resonates with the Loewe customer, and that didn’t come from LVMH,” Burke enthused about the designer, who hails from Northern Ireland and whose dalliances with Loewe’s historic home of Spain had been limited to vacations in Ibiza before he joined the Madrid-based house in 2013.

Near the top of Burke’s to-do list will be helping to decide on the next artistic director at Givenchy following the exit of Matthew M. Williams at the conclusion of his initial three-year contract. He and Toledano sat together at the brand’s menswear show on Wednesday.

During a wide-ranging interview, they steered clear of discussing plans for specific brands, though both men have a reputation for bold recruitment choices — and spectacular business results.

When Phoebe Philo stepped down at Celine at the end of 2017, the appointment of Hedi Slimane as her successor “was not an obvious decision,” Toledano said. “Frankly, if we had used artificial intelligence, I don’t think the software, the algorithm would have given the name of Hedi Slimane.”

Before exiting Dior, Toledano appointed Maria Grazia Chiuri as its seventh couturier — a decision based largely on intuition and soft criteria, and one that has propelled the brand into the stratosphere. Previously, he had worked with John Galliano and Raf Simons at Dior, in addition to Slimane and Kris Van Assche for the men’s universe.

In a press release shared first with WWD, Arnault noted that Toledano “has identified and promoted numerous creative talents who are now among the world’s most recognized designers.”

“With his unique strategic vision, he played a pivotal role in making Dior the world’s most prestigious and admired fashion maison,” while as head of the LVMH Fashion Group, “his creative leadership contributed to the spectacular growth of our fashion maisons, which benefited from his deep experience to further heighten their desirability,” Arnault said.

He noted Toledano would “remain very much involved as my adviser and will continue to share his passion and exacting professionalism with all the group’s teams. He still has a tremendous amount to bring us.”

Among Burke’s masterstrokes was recruiting Virgil Abloh, founder of Off-White, as Vuitton’s artistic director of menswear in 2018, which brought the house buzz, cultural currency and a mold-breaking creative figure whose impact reverberates still. Burke is also said to have had a strong hand in wrangling Japanese streetwear guru Nigo for the top design job at Kenzo.

According to market sources, Vuitton’s revenues tripled during Burke’s tenure, with profitability leaping fourfold.

Commenting on Burke’s latest role in the press release, Arnault noted that the executive has been at his side even before the creation of LVMH, initially working on residential real estate in the U.S. in the early ’80s before joining Christian Dior stateside in 1986.

“He has always been a key player in the group’s success, in particular thanks to the remarkable discernment and finesse of his work at the head of Fendi, Bulgari and Louis Vuitton,” Arnault said. “His extensive experience and his passion for craft and creativity are invaluable assets to pursue and further accelerate the dynamic growth of the maisons in the LVMH Fashion Group.”

Toledano is similarly optimistic.

“I don’t know other groups in the industry already having two giant brands and preparing very big companies as well,” Toledano said, referring to Louis Vuitton and Dior, and his view that “four or five” of the Fashion Group brands harbor potential to be very big.

Both men are firm believers in having the right combination of CEO and creative director, but also matched to the right brand.

Toledano described it as his “triangle theory,” with the center of gravity in the middle of those three elements. “If you take talented CEO and a talented designer and you give the wrong brand, I’m afraid it will not work,” he said.

“The relationship is an osmosis,” Burke piped in. “You can’t recognize the individual parts once it’s happened. And when that happens, it’s not twice as much or four times as much, it’s 100 times more powerful than something that is management-driven and authoritarian. When the teams notice that this osmosis is occurring, that the triangle is happening, everything comes instantaneously.”

A charismatic, cerebral and well-rounded executive with a fun-loving streak and a ready laugh, Burke is known for his ability to motivate teams, meshing well with creative types and for thriving on complexity.

Born in the French Alps, Burke had a peripatetic childhood since his father was in the air force. He grew up in the U.S., went to high school in Germany and then enrolled in business school EDHEC in Lille, France, going on to work as an intern for an associate of Arnault.

After Dior, Burke next served as president and CEO of Louis Vuitton North America from 1993 until 1997, when he moved to Paris, ultimately becoming Toledano’s number-two position at the fashion house.

After eight years leading Fendi in Rome, Burke was conscripted in 2011 to take up the management helm at Bulgari SpA, which LVMH had acquired earlier that year. He brought two signatures of his brand leadership to Bulgari: surprise and speed.

At the end of 2013, he was moved over to Louis Vuitton, where he initiated an upscaling drive that changed the brand’s fortunes, and scope.

Toledano is perhaps best known for his eventful 18 years as CEO of Christian Dior Couture, nimbly steering the French fashion house through many delicate creative transitions, economic and other crises. He was widely admired for his decisive and dignified handling of John Galliano’s fall from grace in 2011, and managing strong growth in the aftermath, first with Galliano’s deputy Bill Gaytten and then Raf Simons.

Toledano famously expanded the Dior business tenfold, transforming the company from a licensing-driven operation to one centered on control of production and distribution.

An engineer by training, Toledano’s strong financial and analytical skills are married to a passion for the fashion industry. After getting his engineering degree from École Centrale Paris, he started his career at market research firm A.C. Nielsen.

His first step into fashion came when a friend of his invested in French firm Kickers, known primarily for its shoes and children’s clothes. After two years, he was recruited by Lancel — a pivotal move that let him “discover the world of leather goods,” which would become the engine of the luxury goods sector.

In 1993, Toledano joined Dior to help Arnault build a leather goods business for the storied French house. By 1998, he assumed the management helm and initiated its global expansion.

A right brain/left brain type, Toledano has a knack for managing creative leaders, and boasts a gold-plated Rolodex of industry contacts.

Now as adviser to Arnault, he sees the role extending beyond LVMH companies to other matters and subjects, be it related to a certain geography or creative conundrum. “It will be advice from experience — a connected one, not operational,” he noted.

In the press release, Toledano noted that he and Arnault “share a passion for innovation, creativity, excellence and passing on savoir-faire. It is thanks to his bold vision that the LVMH Group is today a global leader.”

Outside of LVMH, Toledano is chairman of the board of the Institut Français de la Mode; president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture; a member of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode’s executive committee, and a board member of French luxury association Comité Colbert."
Bernard Arnault Tightens Family Control Over LVMH - WWD,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtdGlnaHRlbnMtZmFtaWx5LWNvbnRyb2wtbHZtaC0xMjM2MTU1NDU0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Global demand for luxury goods may be slowing, but Bernard Arnault is always eyeing a bigger slice of the pie.

Speaking after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported another year of record results, the tycoon said he has no intention of breaking up his group, which posted sales of 86.15 billion euros in 2023. Rather, he’s tightening his family’s grip on its leadership and continues to target growth.

In the latest move to prepare his succession, Arnault, who turns 75 in March, confirmed that the luxury conglomerate will propose the appointments of his sons Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault to the board at the next annual general meeting, to be held on April 18.

“It’s fashionable right now in a lot of countries to bring in younger leadership. Well, we’re getting younger too, even if I’m not planning to go anywhere either in the short term or long term. I prefer to let that be known straight away because you might ask me about it, so rest easy,” the LVMH chairman and chief executive officer told analysts and reporters.

Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president of product and communications at U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., and Frédéric Arnault, CEO of LVMH Watches, will join their siblings Antoine Arnault, head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, and Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the board.

That leaves the youngest sibling, Jean Arnault, who is in his mid-20s and is marketing and product development director for watches at Louis Vuitton. “He’s got time, he’s young,” Arnault told reporters on the margins of the press conference at the company’s headquarters in Paris.

Speaking to a small group of journalists, the executive quashed suggestions that LVMH should break up its business to unlock value for investors.

This follows an article this week by Bloomberg Opinion columnist Andrea Felsted pointing out that LVMH is trading at a steep discount to Hermès because of the disparate nature of its businesses, which include Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as beauty retailer Sephora, but also wines and spirits, duty-free retailing and hospitality.

“I can’t consider it under any circumstances. I find it completely inappropriate,” Arnault said of the suggestion to split LVMH. “If our financial services are dynamic enough, we must significantly increase our price-to-earnings ratio without any spin-off, because that would be a mistake, since the group is built precisely on this diversity of brands.”

He said LVMH was likely to get even fatter, whether through acquisitions or organic growth. Citing another recent newspaper article during his opening speech, he said Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel and Hermès were considered the market leaders in soft luxury, and Tiffany, Bulgari, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels the top four in hard luxury.

“Among the eight brands that I consider to be the best in the world, we have half, which is already quite good. We’ll see what happens later, if we manage to expand the scope a little, or if we manage to push some other brands to join the first four,” he said.

Addressing past rumors that LVMH was interested in acquiring rival Compagnie Financière Richemont, Arnault was playful, after chairman Johann Rupert reiterated last year that he has no plans to sell Richemont or its star brand Cartier.

“I consider Mr. Rupert an exceptional leader and I have no desire to interfere with his strategy. I understand that he’s keen to remain independent,” Arnault said. “I think it’s very good and if he needs support to retain his independence, I will be there,” he added to chuckles from the room.

The executive said he expected growth to remain stable in 2024 versus the prior year. It promises to be a banner period for LVMH, which is a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

“Personally, I’m very confident,” Arnault said. “We’re going to start to see the impact of future interest rate cuts, and I also expect a positive impact on the U.S. economy from the upcoming [presidential] election. Each time there’s an election in the U.S., the market is more dynamic.”

On the risk side, he raised the prospect of a spiraling of the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. “That is the main concern I see for 2024. Aside from that, I think the economic outlook will be better overall for our products,” he said. “Oddly enough, the strongest demand is for the most premium products.”

He also sought to put a positive spin on the normalization of the luxury industry’s growth rates after three years of post-pandemic euphoria.

In results reported after the market close on Thursday, LVMH said like-for-like sales at its key fashion and leather goods division rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with market expectations. Arnault noted that after several years of double-digit organic revenue growth, Dior was now performing in line with the segment’s overall progression.

“We have reached a stage where we no longer need such strong growth and for me, between 8 and 10 percent is ideal,” he said, noting that he prefers to focus on the desirability of his brands with exclusive products, rather than chasing higher sales. “I would rather hit the brakes than the accelerator.”

Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony noted that the group’s average annual organic growth rate over the last 35 years was 9.1 percent.

LVMH’s sales growth slowed in the second half of 2024, although there was a slight improvement in the fourth quarter, thanks to the strong performance of its selective retailing and perfume and cosmetics divisions, and an easier comparison basis with the same period last year when much of China was in lockdown due to COVID-19.

Overall group sales were up 5.5 percent at actual exchange rates to 23.95 billion euros in the three months ended Dec. 31, following a 1 percent increase in the previous three months. This represented a rise of 10 percent on a like-for-like basis, up from the 9 percent recorded in the third quarter.

To help future-proof its strategy, LVMH kicked off the year with several senior executive changes.

Group veteran Michael Burke is set to succeed Sidney Toledano at the head of LVMH Fashion Group, overseeing Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Emilio Pucci. It is understood Burke’s stable of brands will be expanded to include Fendi.

Toledano will leave the LVMH executive committee and become an adviser to Bernard Arnault in the handover, which takes effect on Feb. 1. Arnault said Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, would also move on to a new role, though he declined to elaborate.

French businessman Henri de Castries is also among the nominees to join the board, following the decision by Charles de Croisset, Yves-Thibault de Silguy and Nicolas Bazire to not stand for reelection as directors.

LVMH shares have fallen by more than 23 percent over the last six months amid a global slowdown in luxury demand. In late August, LVMH was overtaken as Europe’s most valuable listed company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.

Its fourth-quarter report comes on the heels of mixed results for its luxury peers.

Burberry lowered its full-year profit guidance after disappointing holiday sales, but Richemont beat expectations thanks to strong demand for jewelry in markets such as Japan, mainland China and North America.

Meanwhile, Brunello Cucinelli said results in the fourth quarter were the best ever in absolute value, with sales up 15.6 percent year-over-year. Kering is due to report full-year results on Feb. 8, with Hermès International set to follow on Feb. 9."
Luxury Group LVMH's Revenue Defies Macro Pressures - Markets Insider,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL2x1eHVyeS1ncm91cC1sdm1oLXMtcmV2ZW51ZS1kZWZpZXMtbWFjcm8tcHJlc3N1cmVzLTEwMzMwMDAzNzTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH (FR:MC), delivered impressive revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, defying macro pressures. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year to €23.9 billion, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimate of around €23.6 billion. The top line reflected a marked improvement from the 1% revenue growth in the third quarter. The fourth quarter revenue grew 10% on an organic basis, better than 9% in Q3 2023. LVMH shares were up 9% as of writing.

LVMH is one of the world’s largest makers of luxury goods. It owns several popular labels, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bulgari, and Tiffany.

LVMH’s Resilient Results

For the full year 2023, LVMH’s revenue of €86.15 billion surpassed analysts’ forecast of €85.74 billion and grew 13% on an organic basis. All the segments reported impressive organic revenue growth except the Wines & Spirits business, which was weighed down by tough comparisons and high inventory levels. Coming to region-wise performance, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia generated double-digit organic revenue growth.

The full-year net profit increased nearly 8% to €15.17 billion but slightly missed analysts’ estimate of €15.68 billion. The bottom line was impacted by currency headwinds in the second half of the year.

Overall, LVMH’s 2023 performance reflected resilience, given the tough macroeconomic backdrop in key markets. However, the company still lags the strong post-pandemic surge that it experienced when customers splurged money on high-end goods. The pent-up demand for luxury goods started fading due to elevated interest rates.

Looking ahead, management is confident about the company’s performance this year. Also, LVMH proposed a dividend of €13 per share, up from the prior-year’s payment of €12 per share. The company’s final dividend of €7.50 per share will be paid on April 25, 2024.

Separately, the group confirmed the nomination of Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault, and French businessman Henri de Castries to the board of directors at the upcoming annual general meeting, to be held on April 18. The move is a part of LVMH’s efforts to bolster the Arnault family’s hold on the company.

Is it Worth Investing in LVMH?

LVMH shares have declined more than 14% over the past year. Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about LVMH stock, given the ongoing macro uncertainty in key markets and geopolitical tensions.

With seven Buys and seven Holds, MC shares score a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton share price target of €799.14 implies nearly 17% upside potential. However, analysts could revise their ratings and/or price targets in reaction to the company’s results and management’s commentary.

Will LVMH Signal an End to Luxury's Slump? - The Business of Fashion,"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZWFybmluZ3MtbHV4dXJ5LW91dGxvb2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Haute couture shows start in Paris this week. The ultra-expensive, handcrafted looks on display there are among the few luxury items brands can still count on their customers to buy these days.

The category is off to a grim start this year, with a slew of bleak sales and profit warnings from brands such as Burberry and Hugo Boss. The slowdown appears to be global, and driven by a pullback from aspirational shoppers who are most vulnerable to inflation and economic uncertainty (quiet luxury purveyor Brunello Cucinelli and high-end jewellery focused Richemont have fared better as they cater to the wealthiest consumers, the reason couture labels likely also have little to fear from the current moment). Though inflation is coming under control in most major economies, it may take some painful discounting to lure those entry level customers back into stores.

LVMH’s fourth-quarter results on Thursday will provide the definitive read on the state of luxury in 2024. The conglomerate has the biggest window into just about every geography and strata of the market, whether it’s how entry-level Louis Vuittion handbags are selling in China, appetite for Dior couture in the Middle East or global beauty sales at Sephora.

Expect a mix of optimism and caution: Loro Piana’s sales are almost certainly surging right alongside Cucinelli’s, and perhaps executives can make the case for modest improvement in the US and China at megabrands Louis Vuitton and Dior. Among LVMH’s smaller labels, Celine and Loewe are starting to gain critical mass commercially.

Investors have low expectations. LVMH shares are trading close to the lows they hit after reporting a shock slowdown in sales growth in October. A strong showing will likely lift the entire category. Another weak report will be interpreted as a sign luxury brands haven’t yet hit bottom.

On Sunday, Miami will play host to the first watch event of the year, albeit one dedicated to just a handful of brands under LVMH’s watch stable. The fifth iteration of the luxury conglomerate’s annual Watch Week will feature two recently revived venerable watch names, Gérald Genta and Daniel Roth, alongside regulars such as Hublot, Tag Heuer, and Zenith. It is also the first event to take place just three weeks after a top-level reshuffle of the chief executives of some of its brands.

At the event, Gérald Genta — the brand named after the legendary designer behind Patek Philippe’s Nautilus and Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak models, among others — will be presenting a fresh take on the Mickey Mouse model, 40 years after its original was first revealed at a Swiss watch fair.

“When Mr Genta unveiled the original at the 1984 Montres et Bijoux exhibition in Basel, the organisers asked him to leave because it was not considered a serious enough watch for the show,” says Jean Arnault, the Louis Vuitton watch director who is now in charge of the Genta brand. “Afterwards, he wrote a letter to management, politely removing himself from any further watch exhibitions.”

The Gérald Genta dial name passed to the Italian jewellery house Bulgari in 2000, which LVMH then bought for $5.2bn in 2011 — the year of Genta’s death. But the brand had produced little of note between 2000 and last year, when it was announced that it would be relaunched under LVMH with its original remit of making high complication watches in low numbers.

Its latest octagonal, platinum-cased model is powered by a minute repeating, jump-hour movement and has a hand-enamelled dial on which time is marked by a prancing Mickey’s revolving arm. Given the SFr390,000 ($449,900) price, few event organisers would consider Genta’s offering anything less than serious, these days. Indeed, the horological scene has changed beyond measure in the 40 years since Genta was rebuffed — as has the burgeoning world of watch shows.

Gérald Genta’s latest take on the Mickey Mouse model

Until 2019, Baselworld — the century-old Swiss event that began as Montres et Bijoux — and Geneva’s Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie were pretty much the only two watch exhibitions that mattered. But it is a very different picture after the Covid pandemic and Baselworld’s collapse in 2020.

Now, globetrotting watch lovers can indulge their passion almost year-round at events in locations ranging from Las Vegas to London, from Geneva to Doha, and from Singapore to New York.

Although LVMH Watch Week was only launched in 2020, in Dubai — and was forced to go virtual for two years amid the pandemic, before returning “live” in Singapore last year — it has quickly gained traction as one of the most important events in the horological calendar.

For Bulgari chief executive Jean-Christophe Babin, who was one of the main driving forces behind the instigation of Watch Week, the event is all about having frequent opportunities for product announcements during the year.

“I felt very uncomfortable back in 2019, when we were told the dates for the Basel and Geneva watch shows would be moving to April,” he recalls.

The sooner clients know some of the novelties that are going to be produced, the sooner they can plan their own activities

“I believe clients need to be able to create a structure at the start of the year — the sooner they know some of the novelties that are going to be produced, the sooner they can plan their own activities.

“Now, in addition to LVMH Watch Week and Watches & Wonders, we also have Geneva Watch Days, at the end of August. That gives us the chance to focus on three separate sets of new products. And we are calling next week in Miami our ‘time of gold’, because most new pieces will be made from precious metals.”

Babin says the strategy is based on the expectation that high-end consumers are generally far less likely to be affected by difficulties in the global economy, “and that they are even more likely to want to indulge in luxury and go looking for objects made from precious metals”.

Hublot’s store in Miami’s Design District

As part of the executive reshuffling earlier this month, ex-Tag Heuer chief executive Frédéric Arnault became head of the LVMH’s watch division, which necessitated handing over the reins of Tag Heuer to Julien Tornare. The latter’s position as chief executive of Zenith has, in turn, been filled by Benoit de Clerck’s move from Richemont-owned Italian brand Panerai.

As he settles in to running Tag Heuer, Tornare welcomes the opportunity to kick-off his role with a debut in Miami. “The US is our biggest market, so the concept behind LVMH Watch Week — which is largely that we go to the markets rather than the markets come to us — is particularly relevant to Tag Heuer, especially since we have a very important boutique in the Design District.”

Meanwhile, Hublot chief executive Ricardo Guadalupe says that the combination of big watch events in Switzerland and smaller ones in different parts of the world allows him to regularly “meet 100 per cent of our distribution network as a result of us going to them in different locations each year”.

Guadalupe adds that, for Hublot, watch shows have evolved from being almost entirely B2B events to more skewed towards consumers. “We have around a dozen [boutiques] in the US and we will invite some VVIPs to Miami, after which we will send the 20-or-so new pieces on a roadshow around the country. Clients definitely appreciate the opportunity to meet CEOs and, in our case, the artists with whom we collaborate.”

Michael Burke, an American and long-standing ally of LVMH's patriarch Bernard Arnault, is poised to take the reins as CEO of LVMH's Fashion division, overseeing a constellation of high-profile brands including Céline, LV, Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Loewe.

His distinguished predecessor, Sidney Toledano, transitions to an advisory role to Arnault after a fruitful tenure at the helm of Dior and the LVMH Fashion Group.

Burke is a seasoned executive within LVMH, and is stepping up from his role as advisor to Arnault, a position he's held since relinquishing a decade-long leadership at Louis Vuitton.

""Like Bernard Arnault and Sidney, whom I am succeeding, I am an apostle of the long term, of craftsmanship, creativity and excellence,"" he says in a press release.

The announcement follows other recent executive reshuffles within the LVMH leadership, including the appointment of Frédéric Arnault to spearhead a new Watches division and Antoine Arnault's transition from CEO to Chairman of Berluti.

This latest move underscores LVMH's commitment to continuity and excellence in leadership. Burke's appointment is a testament to his profound imprint on the group's trajectory. Under his stewardship, Louis Vuitton scaled new heights, surpassing the €20 billion mark in annual sales. He oversaw projects such as the ground-breaking LV x Supreme collaboration, regarded as a game changer for the luxury and streetwear movement.

Bernard Arnault's endorsement of Burke is emphatic, highlighting his pivotal role since the inception of LVMH and his astute leadership across brands like Fendi, Bulgari, and Louis Vuitton. Burke's vision for the LVMH Fashion Group is clear: to perpetuate the legacy of craftsmanship, creativity, and excellence, synonymous with the group’s ethos.

As LVMH gears up to unveil its annual results for 2023 on January 25, the industry watches closely, anticipating the next chapter under the stewardship of these seasoned titans in the world of luxury fashion, especially during challenging times for the industry and economy."

LVMH, which owns labels including Louis Vuitton and Dior, posted a 10% rise in Q4 sales on Thursday (January 25), hitting $26 billion.

The company’s analyst-beating growth was driven by continued demand for high-end fashion, including from Chinese buyers.

It offered reassurance to investors over the luxury industry’s resilience in the face of economic headwinds and slowing demand after a lengthy spending splurge that fuelled stellar sales following the global health crisis.

Investors had become skittish about the industry’s prospects after the conglomerate’s October report showed sales growth had slowed to 9%.

That was after a long spell of routinely outpacing expectations with strong double-digit growth.

An analyst said the new report should be enough to “steady nerves in the near term”.

The group proposed a dividend of 13 euros per share, up from 12 euros a year ago.

And it forecast continued growth next year despite an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical context."
Bernard Arnault Plans to Appoint Two More of His Sons to the LVMH Board - Robb Report,"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtYm9hcmQtc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi0xMjM1NDg0MTg5L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtYm9hcmQtc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi0xMjM1NDg0MTg5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault’s succession plan may not be any clearer, but the billionaire CEO of LVMH is making some familial moves at his company.

Arnault is set to put two more of his sons on the board of his French conglomerate, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Alexandre, 31, and Frédéric, 29, could be nominated as early as this week, an anonymous source familiar with the matter told the outlet. A vote would then occur at LVMH’s annual general meeting in April. (A spokesperson for the company declined to comment to Bloomberg.)

Already, two of Arnault’s other children sit on the board: Both Delphine and Antoine, the two oldest kids, became board members before they turned 30. Delphine, 48, is now the CEO of Dior, the second-largest fashion label in the LVMH family. Antoine, 46, is in charge of the entire conglomerate’s image and communications arm.

The rest of Arnault’s five children also hold roles within LVMH: Alexandre is currently the head of product and communications at Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric runs the watch unit, including Hublot, Zenith, and TAG Heuer; and Jean, 25, is leading efforts to expand Louis Vuitton’s watch offerings. In all, the family holds about 48 percent of LVMH shares and almost 64 percent of voting rights.

Over the years, Arnault has been expanding his family’s hold on LVMH, involving his children in various aspects of the company so that one day they can take over. Back in 2022, Arnault lifted the age limit for the CEO of LVMH to 80, and given that he’s just 74, any succession plans may take years to bear out. But he’s made it clear that he wants his kids to one day run the massive empire he’s created. So far, though, that hasn’t led to any Succession-style antics, with the Arnault children saying that they get along extremely well.

Whoever does end up taking Arnault’s place will have big shoes to fill. The Frenchman is currently the third-wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $161 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And LVMH last year became the first-ever $500 billion company in Europe. That sort of status and responsibility may scare off some people. But the Arnaults have demonstrated that they’re much more than just “some people.”"
LVMH's Sidney Toledano: Lessons From 40 Years in Luxury - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 22 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLWx2bWgtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — “We don’t have the luxury of waiting” flashes on a screen on the ninth floor of LVMH’s Avenue Montaigne headquarters. Luxury may take time, but the world’s largest luxury group prides itself on moving quickly.

Flanked by two Murakamis and a Rothko, longtime LVMH executive Sidney Toledano advances down a hushed corridor to a meeting room surrounded by the Paris sky.

Toledano is preparing to conclude a transformative six-year tenure as chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Fashion Group, whose labels Celine and Loewe have grown into global megabrands during a period of explosive growth for the luxury sector.

In a statement Thursday, LVMH confirmed that Toledano, who previously led Christian Dior Couture as its CEO for nearly 20 years, would transition to an advisory role after passing the baton to former Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke on Feb 1. In addition to advising LVMH, Toledano will serve as chairman of French fashion school IFM.

“Over more than 30 years of close and fruitful collaboration, [Toledano] has identified and promoted numerous creative talents who are now among the world’s most recognised designers. With his unique strategic vision, he played a pivotal role in making Dior the world’s most prestigious and admired fashion house,” LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

In a series of interviews with The Business of Fashion in the months running up to the changing of the guard, Toledano shared insights and memories from four decades in the luxury business, as well as his personal life, tracing his trajectory from a childhood in Casablanca to a blockbuster tenure at Christian Dior — alongside top designers including John Galliano, Hedi Slimane, Raf Simons and Maria Grazia Chiuri — and beyond.

Toledano often speaks of the past in the present tense, in short, direct sentences — underscoring his conviction and intuitive pragmatism as he revisits an extraordinary path.

Laurence Benaïm: You were born in 1951 in Morocco, then a French colony.

Sidney Toledano: I was lucky to grow up in a family irrigated by several cultures: Moroccan Spanish through my father, and Sephardic Turkish through my mother. At home, we used to speak Spanish, Ladino and French. My upbringing was a school of tolerance: I learned Hebrew from a rabbi who came to the house three times a week, while attending classes at a Catholic kindergarten. We would celebrate the end of Ramadan with our Muslim friends.

LB: Your father was president of the Jewish Community of Casablanca. What did he pass on to you?

ST: A taste for learning, for transmission, but also a yearning for freedom. I come from a family of three boys. My father wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer.

The important thing was to do good to others. There were over 280,000 Jews in Morocco. Most of them were poor, in particular in the Mellah [a walled district where most Moroccan Jews resided]. My father was at one point rabbi of Larache, a port town where Jews and Muslims shared a common sanctuary, before fighting as a Republican soldier in the Spanish Civil War. When the American army landed in Northern Africa in 1942, my father saw the world change.

He and my mother loved fashion: a symbol of renewal. He was the first person in Casablanca to have parachutes turned into shirts. A tailor used to come to the house to make his suits. He was very elegant. In his own way, he passed on to me a taste for fashion, for a kind of North African dolce vita that has never left me.

LB: Tell me about your arrival in France and early career.

ST: I arrived in France in 1969 and spent two years in Marseille. I wanted to be a researcher in physics. If I’d been born in France, it would have been different: I loved history and literature, too, but mathematics was a neutral language. When faced with a math problem, we were all on an equal footing. French culture couldn’t impose any barriers.

I was admitted to the École Centrale de Paris, where I began to love statistics, and ended up graduating in Applied Mathematics. I started my career as a data analyst at Nielsen: five years of travel, from Europe to the United States. Then consulting firms, Procter & Gamble, L’Oréal, and Coca Cola.

One day in Paris, at the Bar des Théâtres on Avenue Montaigne, I met Jacques Toledano (no relation) who had just bought the shoe brand Kickers. I knew nothing about leather or shoes. I’m 31 years old and my wife, Katia, is pregnant with my first daughter Inès. I started working at Kickers in September 1982 and stayed until December 1983. The company was in difficulty and went into administration. I learned what it means to have unpaid debts and union problems, and at the same time to launch new products, to advertise.

Then I went to Lancel, a leather goods brand created in 1876 that initially specialised in accessories for smokers. It was with Lancel’s owners, the Zorbibe brothers, that I learned the basics of leather goods. At first, they took me on as a financial controller. But I took a liking for the product, for luggage and bags. I launched the famous Red luggage line which was a triumph. Then there was the Elsa bucket bag, a reinterpretation of the Noé shape created by Gaston Louis Vuitton in the early 1930s. “Red 1876″ became the brand’s symbol while the Elsa bag was the bestseller. I learned how to build lines and analyse sales, going to the store every Saturday.

LB: How did you join LVMH?

ST: At the end of 1993, I was approached by Bernard Arnault. The meeting in his office was decisive: I signed my first Dior Couture contract on Jan. 17, 1994, becoming director of leather goods. Arnault’s vision was very clear: he wanted the leather goods business to grow from 5 percent [of sales] to a significant share of the retail business, to make it profitable.

On my first day at 9 AM, the telephone rings. It’s Bernard Arnault, who asks “Have you thought about the bag?” Three months later, I showed him a bag that referenced the caning on Napoleon III chairs, which we called internally the “Chouchou.” It was to become the Lady Dior. Launched in leather in 1995, it became a worldwide success. I was appointed managing director in charge of international development in 1996. Then in 1998, I became chairman and CEO. Others hit bags followed, like the Saddle. When I left Christian Dior in 2017, leather goods represented more than 45 percent of sales.

LB: How else did you develop the house of Dior?

ST: The success of Dior’s leather goods allowed us to stop licensing — there were hundreds of them — and to develop the retail, adopting a Louis Vuitton-type model. Gianfranco Ferré designed beautiful haute couture, but we had more difficulty in ready-to-wear. The development of leather goods was enabling us to grow. At the end of Ferré's contract, in October 1996, John Galliano was appointed. His first Dior couture show took place in 1997.

With John, a new era began. It was a big bang. John brought his vision and gave a huge creative impulse. After I succeeded François Beaufumé as CEO, in March 1998, I appointed Victoire de Castellane as director of jewellery. In 1999, we asked ourselves the question of men’s ready-to-wear. We needed a young designer. Discussions started with Hedi Slimane, who was then at Saint Laurent where he’d been chosen by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé to design the house’s Rive Gauche collections. After Saint Laurent was taken over by Domenico De Sole and Tom Ford, Hedi came to Dior.

His first fashion show took place in January 2000 in the presence of Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Bergé and Azzedine Alaïa: Hedi got a standing ovation. That was another creative big bang. Hedi Slimane launched the men’s equivalent of the “New Look.” His new image of the Dior man, younger and very slim, becomes a global movement, a revolution. Everyone will copy it. The house of Dior then consisted of three powerful creative directors: John Galliano, Hedi Slimane and Victoire de Castellane.

We started the development of a worldwide distribution network. In 1994, Dior only had six directly-operated stores and a few franchises; we started opening 25 stores per year. In 1997, Peter Marino renovated the boutique on Avenue Montaigne for the house’s 50th anniversary, and his concept was applied from New York to Tokyo. Hedi Slimane developed a men’s store. In 1993, Christian Dior Couture’s sales were around €120 million euros ($130 million). We passed the €1 billion mark in 2011, despite the effects of the Great Recession and John Galliano’s departure earlier that year.

LB: Can we talk about February 24, 2011, the day a complaint was filed against John Galliano for making anti-Semitic remarks at Café La Perle in Paris?

ST: It was a shock. I used to attend a lot of fittings; I would even visit the creative team unexpectedly. It was a great pleasure watching them work, even better than the show. Joy was everywhere; a dream that I’ve never found again. The level of creativity and energy was dizzying.

We knew that John had alcohol problems. We’ve been trying to warn him for weeks. The week before the incident, he did not come to the office, having sent a medical certificate. I came back from Milan. The atmosphere was already stressful. Then I received a fax telling me he had made these comments the day before. He was questioned by police. His lawyer told me it wasn’t true. Over the weekend, we learned of other incidents. On Monday, a video was broadcast by an English television channel, with John making anti-semitic comments which were just unacceptable. Something was broken.

LB: You called Daniel Sibony, the French mathematician and psychoanalyst for guidance. What did he tell you?

ST: I wanted to understand. I wanted to know if it was drugs or alcohol that could make people say such things. He reminded me of a phrase found in the Babylonian Talmud: “Wine comes, the secret goes,” and of course the Latin expression, “In vino veritas.” Sibony talked to me about self-hatred, the hatred that drives you to the irremediable, this irruption of violence that targets others.

LB: On March 1, Dior fired John Galliano. Have you seen him again? Do you have a relationship today?

ST: We were right there, in this room, with Bernard Arnault and [his daughter] Delphine, and we unanimously decided to fire him. I thought he was going to apologise. He didn’t. I waited. John Galliano left the country the next day. It was Tuesday and the show was scheduled on Friday. I went to the studio. I met Bill Gaytten, John’s right-hand man in the creation studio, and the whole team to announce John’s departure. We were no longer in a state of grace.

The runway show took place a few days later.

Seven years later, he finally understood. He came to ask for forgiveness. I remember from my childhood how on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), I saw men reaching out to others: they said “Mehila” (forgiveness in Hebrew) for the offended to remove from their hearts any feelings of hatred or anger. He did it, and I felt relieved. I took him to Dior to visit the archives; and we met recently again at Margiela. I continue to admire John.

LB: Two drivers, a bodyguard, a doctor, a hairdresser, a make-up artist, a sports coach. Do you regret giving in to John Galliano’s every whim? What lessons have you learned from this episode?

ST: No, I have no regrets.

LB: How did Dior cope with the incident?

ST: I knew that time was running out; we had to move forward. We went a year without a creative director, looking for solutions. We talked to a lot of people. The first person I called was Alber Elbaz. We loved him very much. He was at Lanvin; it didn’t work out because he was feeling very good there. I even spoke to Azzedine Alaïa, who had been approached by [former CEO] Beaufumé before Galliano. My idea was to only do haute couture with him. Then, there was Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière… And finally, I came across Raf Simons, who was leaving Jil Sander. And we said to ourselves that perhaps it was the solution to move towards more minimalism. But the American sirens of Calvin Klein lured him back. Then there was the arrival of Maria Grazia [Chiuri] in early July 2016;. Kris Van Assche succeeded Hedi on the men’s side of the business. A new adventure began.

LB: According to market sources, Dior Couture’s annual sales are now around €9 billion euros. Did you ever think it could become that big? What makes this brand so powerful?

ST: By 2016, sales had reached €2.5 billion euros. All the foundations were solid. Flagship stores were already opened worldwide, as well as the infrastructure for product development, ateliers and factories. The dynamic has been accelerated by my successor Pietro Beccari. And thanks to Maria Grazia Chiuri, whose new strong image of women’s style at Dior is blooming.

LB: What do you appreciate the most in her work?

ST: She understands what women want. She dreams with her feet on the ground. She’s able to talk directly not only to designers but to prototypists of bags, and shoes. This touches me, because I need to feel and experience the product. It has always been ingrained in me. I am very sensitive to beautiful fabrics and material.

LB: What is your advice for working with creative people in the corporate world?

ST: The new generation of artistic directors is rather aware of business. They want to know about sales, to push them. They are motivated.

To work with a creator, you have to give them time to mature, so that they can express a coherent image. The important thing is to make the brand desirable to a targeted audience. Desire is the most important thing.

They need to feel supported. They need to be given the means to get things done on time. Step by step. The boss must check. It’s like the director and producer of a film. They need to have a real dialogue. The creative is the master builder, but they cannot do it alone. We must agree on the target, we need empathy.

There has to be a dance between the two. It’s not about becoming friends. That’s a trap. You must know how to keep your distance, but be available when they need you, otherwise you become a nanny, managing anxiety attacks. There are coaches for that. You must love creative people, and above all you mustn’t compete with them. The creative director is the face of the brand, not the CEO.

LB: LVMH has an active controlling shareholder, Mr. Arnault, whose family has become more involved in the company in recent years. What is your advice for working with a family business? How is it different?

ST: Decisions are made quickly. It’s not like bosses who have been appointed by funds. From Dior, Bernard Arnault built the world’s first luxury group, LVMH, thanks to a true long-term vision. In 1984, the company was worth 100 million francs — not even €20 million. Bernard Arnault gave me a unique opportunity. And the thirty years I have spent with him were the best part of my professional life. All his children grew up in the business. Delphine worked with me for 12 years. And I had an ongoing dialogue with the others, Antoine, Alexandre, Frédéric and Jean. They now have operational roles in the group and share the same values. My advice when working for a family is to understand and share these long-term values.

LB: In February 2018, you were appointed Chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, a division that includes Celine, Givenchy, Loewe, Emilio Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs and Patou. What have been your biggest achievements at the head of this group?

ST: Beyond the fact that the Fashion Group has grown considerably in terms of sales and profitability [Editor’s note: Fashion Group sales have more than doubled since 2018 according to market sources, while profitability grew eight-fold], I believe that with the leaders of this group, the CEOs and creative directors, we have built very solid foundations, enabling a high potential of growth for the future. Brands like Celine, Loewe and Marc Jacobs have already successfully reached a high-level trajectory. We have to give time to the other brands to find their own path to critical scale. Long-term vision is one of the Arnault family’s core values.

Former Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke will succeed Sidney Toledano as chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Fashion Group, effective February 1st. Stéphane Feugère. (Stéphane Feugère)

LB: Any message for your successor, Michael Burke?

ST: My friend Michael is the best person to manage the Fashion Group. The main objective is to have, in the next five years, four or five of the brands not only becoming big in terms of the business, but with a very high desirability and meeting all criteria of excellence.

LB: What is the secret of optimal management within a luxury house?

ST: Being passionate about people: both creative and business leaders. Identify the young talents. Care about people.

Luxury Group LVMH's Revenue Defies Macro Pressures - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:36:28 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dsb2JhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2x1eHVyeS1ncm91cC1sdm1ocy1yZXZlbnVlLWRlZmllcy1tYWNyby1wcmVzc3VyZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH (FR:MC), delivered impressive revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, defying macro pressures. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year to €23.9 billion, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimate of around €23.6 billion. The top line reflected a marked improvement from the 1% revenue growth in the third quarter. The fourth quarter revenue grew 10% on an organic basis, better than 9% in Q3 2023. LVMH shares were up 9% as of writing.

LVMH is one of the world’s largest makers of luxury goods. It owns several popular labels, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bulgari, and Tiffany.

LVMH’s Resilient Results

For the full year 2023, LVMH’s revenue of €86.15 billion surpassed analysts’ forecast of €85.74 billion and grew 13% on an organic basis. All the segments reported impressive organic revenue growth except the Wines & Spirits business, which was weighed down by tough comparisons and high inventory levels. Coming to region-wise performance, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia generated double-digit organic revenue growth.

The full-year net profit increased nearly 8% to €15.17 billion but slightly missed analysts’ estimate of €15.68 billion. The bottom line was impacted by currency headwinds in the second half of the year.

Overall, LVMH’s 2023 performance reflected resilience, given the tough macroeconomic backdrop in key markets. However, the company still lags the strong post-pandemic surge that it experienced when customers splurged money on high-end goods. The pent-up demand for luxury goods started fading due to elevated interest rates.

Looking ahead, management is confident about the company’s performance this year. Also, LVMH proposed a dividend of €13 per share, up from the prior-year’s payment of €12 per share. The company’s final dividend of €7.50 per share will be paid on April 25, 2024.

Separately, the group confirmed the nomination of Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault, and French businessman Henri de Castries to the board of directors at the upcoming annual general meeting, to be held on April 18. The move is a part of LVMH’s efforts to bolster the Arnault family’s hold on the company.

Is it Worth Investing in LVMH?

LVMH shares have declined more than 14% over the past year. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about LVMH stock, given the ongoing macro uncertainty in key markets and geopolitical tensions.

With seven Buys and seven Holds, MC shares score a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton share price target of €799.14 implies nearly 17% upside potential. However, analysts could revise their ratings and/or price targets in reaction to the company’s results and management’s commentary.

LVMH's Sales Climb 10% in Q4 2023 - HYPEBEAST,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzEvbHZtaC1xNC0yMDIzLXNhbGVzLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the mammoth luxury conglomerate that oversees industry-leading brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine and LOEWE, exceeded analysts’ expectations in the fourth-quarter of last year, reporting organic revenue growth of 10%. The average estimate among forecasters was 8%, per Business of Fashion.

The company’s full-year operating profit climbed by 8% to reach €22.8 billion EUR ($24.7 billion USD). LVMH experienced the highest growth in its selective retailing division, which houses labels including Sephora, Hong Kong’s DFS and Belmond Hotels. Sales increased by 21% in the category.

On the fashion and leather goods front, where LVMH makes the majority of its sales, the company saw sales grow by 9%, which mirrors the results that were reported for the third quarter. The parent company also reported particularly strong momentum in its fragrance and makeup division, across all regions.

For the full year, the leading luxury group recorded revenue of €86.2 billion EUR ($93.3 billion USD) in 2023, marking an organic increase of 13% with respect to 2022. The figure surpassed industry estimates of €85.3 billion EUR, per WWD.

“Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement. “This was reflected in Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior’s spectacular fashion shows, Tiffany’s reopening of “The Landmark” in New York and the ever-growing popularity of Sephora’s store concept worldwide.”

Looking to the future, Arnault added, “While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams. It promises to be an inspiring, exceptional year for us all, featuring our partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, whose core values of passion, inclusion and surpassing oneself are shared by our Group.”

LVMH Sales Rise 5.5% in Fourth Quarter On Robust Fashion Performance - WWD,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXNhbGVzLXJpc2UtcTQtZmFzaGlvbi1kaXZpc2lvbi1tb21lbnR1bS0xMjM2MTUzNTg2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was updated Jan. 25 at 1:53 p.m. EST

PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said organic sales for its key fashion and leather goods division rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with market expectations, confirming a normalization of growth rates even as the world’s biggest luxury group reported record full-year revenues for 2023.

In results reported after the market close on Thursday, LVMH said overall group sales rose 5.5 percent at actual exchange rates to 23.95 billion euros in the fourth quarter, following a 1 percent increase in the previous three months.

This represented a rise of 10 percent on a like-for-like basis, up from the 9 percent recorded in the third quarter, and above a consensus forecast for 8.6 percent growth, according to financial services firm Morningstar.

The increase was driven by the strong performance of LVMH’s selective retailing and perfume and cosmetics divisions. The quarter benefited from an easier comparison basis with the same period last year, when much of China was in lockdown due to COVID-19.

LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora and Tiffany & Co., reported total sales rose 8.8 percent to 86.15 billion euros last year, representing a rise of 13 percent on a comparable basis. This was above a consensus forecast of 85.83 billion euros, according to a poll of analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet.

Net profit was up 8 percent to 15.17 billion euros, missing the consensus forecast of 15.72 billion euros, according to the FactSet data. LVMH had cautioned in October that negative currency effects were likely to impact group margins in the second half, though it did not plan to scale back marketing investments.

“Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

“While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams. It promises to be an inspiring, exceptional year for us all, featuring our partnership with Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, whose core values of passion, inclusion and surpassing oneself are shared by our group,” he added.

In a separate statement, the group tightened the Arnault’s family grip on its governance by confirming it will propose the appointments of Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault, alongside French businessman Henri de Castries, to the board of directors at the next annual general meeting, to be held on April 18.

This follows the decision by Charles de Croisset, Yves-Thibault de Silguy and Nicolas Bazire to not stand for re-election as directors.

“LVMH is a family-run group, whose vocation is to ensure the long-term development of each of its maisons in keeping with their identity, their heritage and their expertise. I am delighted to welcome Alexandre and Frédéric to the board. I am convinced that they will each bring interesting perspectives,” Bernard Arnault said in the release.

This comes on the heels of a senior management reshuffle, announced last week, that will see Michael Burke succeed Sidney Toledano at the head of LVMH Fashion Group, overseeing Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Emilio Pucci. It is understood Burke’s stable of brands will be expanded to include Fendi.

Toledano will leave the LVMH executive committee and become an adviser to Bernard Arnault in the handover, which takes effect on Feb. 1. Earlier in the month, LVMH said it was promoting Frédéric Arnault to CEO of LVMH Watches.

LVMH shares have fallen by more than 23 percent over the last six months amid a global slowdown in luxury demand. In late August, LVMH was overtaken as Europe’s most valuable listed company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.

Its fourth-quarter report comes on the heels of mixed results for its luxury peers.

Burberry lowered its full-year profit guidance after disappointing holiday sales, but Compagnie Financière Richemont beat expectations thanks to strong demand for jewelry in markets such as Japan, mainland China and North America.

Meanwhile, Brunello Cucinelli said results in the fourth quarter were the best ever in absolute value, with sales up 15.6 percent year-on-year. Kering is due to report full-year results on Feb. 8, with Hermès International set to follow on Feb. 9."
LVMH Shares Soar After Record Full-year Results - WWD,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXNoYXJlLXByaWNlLWluY3JlYXNlLXJlY29yZC0yMDIzLXJlc3VsdHMtMTIzNjE1NTk2Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Shares in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton soared on Friday as investors cheered the group’s record 2023 results and positive outlook, reversing some of the recent slide in luxury sector stocks.

LVMH shares rose 12.8 percent to 773.10 euros in trading after the world’s biggest luxury group reported sales rose 8.8 percent to 86.15 billion euros last year, up 13 percent on a comparable basis. This was above a consensus forecast of 85.83 billion euros, according to a poll of analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet.

Analysts said the results were reassuring, signaling that the group was able to rapidly adjust its cost base and protect margins despite a normalization of luxury spending. They also noted positive brand momentum, with a resilient Chinese customer base and signs of improvement in the U.S. market.

The news had a ripple effect, with most sector stocks also posting gains. Kering was up 6.6 percent; Compagnie Financière Richemont gained 6.2 percent; Hermès International rose 6.6 percent, and Burberry Group posted a 4.9 percent increase.

“It was a total rerating of the sector, even if investors do not expect the same decent results from all the other companies,” said Mario Ortelli, managing partner of the luxury advisory company Ortelli&Co. “It’s a sector that until a few months ago was a star, and in the last six months lost its luster. The investors realize that probably they were too harsh.”

In results reported after the market close on Thursday, LVMH said group sales rose 5.5 percent at actual exchange rates to 23.95 billion euros in the fourth quarter, following a 1 percent increase in the previous three months. This represented a rise of 10 percent on a like-for-like basis, up from the 9 percent recorded in the third quarter.

Organic sales for its key fashion and leather goods division rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with market expectations.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said he expected the positive momentum to carry over into this year.

“Personally, I’m very confident,” he said. “We’re going to start to see the impact of future interest rate cuts, and I also expect a positive impact on the U.S. economy from the upcoming [presidential] election. Each time there’s an election in the U.S., the market is more dynamic.”

Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC, noted Arnault took the “exact reverse view” to many hedge funds, which have forecast poor U.S. demand in an election year.

He also lauded chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony delivering on his commitment to hold margins broadly stable. Guiony said the operating margin eased to 26.5 percent in 2023 from 26.6 percent the previous year.

“You buy luxury stocks for sales momentum, not as much for margins. But you did have a thesis with hedge funds that margins needed to moderate and it helps that that thought has been invalidated,” Rambourg said.

The analyst said he was impressed by the “very constructive” tone of management comments and by Arnault’s “frankly great sense of humor,” referring to the tycoon’s playful comments about potential future acquisitions. “[It] gave the impression that he’s not (and his group is not) losing much sleep at night about what’s next,” he said.

While the intraday fillip was estimated to have boosted LVMH’s market capitalization by as much as 40 billion euros, Ortelli cautioned that the market was still vulnerable to swings.

“The market is very nervous. If two important companies report in the same day a completely different thing, the market will go down, so nothing is forever in the stock market — as in fashion,” he said."
LVMH is fed up with fake goods being sold on TikTok—so it is in talks to join forces with the video platform to stop it - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 11 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWZlZC1mYWtlLWdvb2RzLWJlaW5nLTEyMTc1MDM2OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TikTok is among the most popular social media platforms with hundreds of millions of users in the U.S. and Europe. In recent years, it has also become notoriously famous as a hotspot to discover branded counterfeits which sell at a fraction of the price of their original versions.

Now the video-sharing app and its parent ByteDance are looking to join forces with French luxury conglomerate LVMH in an effort to weed out the dupes sold through its marketplace, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.

The issue of counterfeit luxury goods online goes far back—well before TikTok became a Gen Z craze. Other social media sites including Facebook and Instagram have also faced challenges battling a growing market for luxury counterfeits of labels like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Prada. The trend for cheap and deceptively good-looking branded products has taken off as the cost-of-living crisis and high inflation make the real brands less affordable. This is especially true of the younger generation of shoppers, who don’t object to owning fakes, according to the Financial Times.

TikTok’s e-commerce foray

The Chinese ByteDance-owned app is still relatively early in its e-commerce foray. Media reports suggested TikTok had dropped its e-commerce efforts in 2022 as it was struggling to click with customers.

But it officially launched TikTok Shop in the U.S. in September (it had been experimenting with shopping in some other markets since 2021). Low-quality products and knock-offs quickly flooded the marketplace, even as TikTok onboarded big brands like Revolve and L’Oréal. TikTok’s efforts with LVMH could help mend its perception as a site offering inferior-quality products, especially as it hopes to expand its e-commerce endeavors. For instance, it’s investing $1.5 billion into growing its Indonesia presence through a joint venture with e-commerce site Tokopedia.

TikTok’s website says it doesn’t “permit the purchase, sale, trade, or solicitation of counterfeit goods” and offers guidelines on how to identify if a product is a dupe.

Story continues

The goal of working with LVMH would be to create an “elevated shopping experience,” Toto Haba, a senior executive at Benefit Cosmetics, a beauty brand owned by LVMH that has a presence on TikTok Shop, told Bloomberg.

Details on TikTok and LVMH’s upcoming plan to tackle counterfeits haven’t been released, and neither company immediately returned Fortune’s request for comment.

LVMH, which is the world's most valuable luxury company, has partnered with companies in the past to help curb counterfeits—in 2014, it announced a partnership with Google to “fight fakes,” the luxury company said at the time, while Bloomberg reported that the Bernard Arnault–owned conglomerate has an agreement with Alibaba to target dupes in its online marketplace, Tmall, according to Benefit Cosmetics’s Haba.

The French brand ran into similar problems on eBay several years ago—the two companies ultimately settled their legal battle in 2014.

Burke will oversee Celine and Loewe, key megabrands-in-the-making, as well as Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Kenzo and Patou.

Burke succeeds Sidney Toledano, the longtime Dior chief who has led LVMH’s Fashion Group since 2018. During Toledano’s tenure, the unit’s sales have grown significantly, largely powered by the success of Celine and Loewe.

Toledano will stay at LVMH as an advisor to chairman Bernard Arnault, the group said, alongside a new role at Paris’ IFM fashion school, where Toledano was named chairman in 2022.

Burke’s appointment follows months of speculation over where the diehard LVMH loyalist, who has worked for Arnault since the 1980s, would land after being succeeded at the group’s biggest and most profitable brand, Louis Vuitton. Pietro Beccari, who previously led a blockbuster tenure at Dior, took the top job at Vuitton early last year.

Some industry sources have questioned whether LVMH’s Fashion Group structure still makes sense: Loewe and Celine now operate at a scale that requires strong, autonomous leadership at the brand level, and the opportunities and challenges they face no longer resemble those of the unit’s smaller outfits as they start to have more in common with larger brands like Loro Piana, Fendi and Dior, which are not housed in the Fashion Group.

Burke will add oversight of Fendi to his responsibilities, and could eventually add Loro Piana to his portfolio, too, as LVMH seeks to streamline reporting lines to ease the succession of Bernard Arnault, aged 74, sources familiar with the group’s thinking said.

Bernard Arnault, the world's third-richest person, is set to appoint two more of his children to LVMH's board, France's La Lettre first reported. The story was also reported by outlets including Bloomberg and The Financial Times.

The French billionaire plans to propose his sons Alexandre Arnault, 31, and Frédéric Arnault, 29, as board members, the reports say, quoting unnamed sources. Their appointments would need to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in April, but that is largely a formality.

Four of Arnault's five children will sit on the LVMH board if their appointments are confirmed.

Delphine, Bernard's oldest child and only daughter, has been on the board since 2003, while eldest son Antoine has been a director since 2006.

The moves will spark renewed speculation about which of Arnault's children might one day take over running LVMH. It's valued at about 335 billion euros ($363 billion), making it Europe's second most valuable company after Novo Nordisk, the Danish maker of Ozempic.

Arnault hasn't commented publicly about a possible successor. In 2022, LVMH raised the age limit for its CEO from 75 to 80 , extending Bernard's possible tenure. He turns 75 in March.

LVMH didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the board appointments.

Alexandre became executive vice-president for product and communications at Tiffany & Co aged just 28 after LVMH bought the jewelry maker for $15.8 billion in 2020.

He also spent about four years as CEO of Rimowa after reportedly persuading his father to buy an 80% stake in the upmarket German luggage brand in 2016.

""I was obviously raised to be in the group,"" Alexandre told The New York Times in 2018. Former President Donald Trump said in February that he'd hosted Alexandre and his wife for dinner at Mar-a-Lago and called him ""a young man on the move.""

Frédéric was appointed head to a new role running LVMH's watches division in January. He was previously CEO of Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer, a role he'd held since 2020 when he was just 25.

Delphie is CEO of Christian Dior Couture, Antoine is CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company the family uses to control LVMH, and Jean, the youngest of Bernard's sons, at 25, leads Louis Vuitton's watches division.

Arnault cofounded LVMH in the 1980s and is its CEO and chairman.

In May 2023, he became the third person to be worth more than $200 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Arnault is worth an estimated $162 billion, mostly from his stake in LVMH, putting him third after Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who are worth $217 billion and $180 billion respectively, per Bloomberg."
LVMH Earnings: What to Expect This Thursday - Morningstar,"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdzdGFyLmNvLnVrL3VrL25ld3MvMjQ1MTU5L2x2bWgtZWFybmluZ3Mtd2hhdC10by1leHBlY3QtdGhpcy10aHVyc2RheS5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH (MC) will release its full-year earnings on January 25 after market close.

As the largest luxury group in the world, its comments on the state of luxury market, in particular in Europe, the US and China, will be watched closely. As usual, the company will say little about its own outlook.

When it released third quarter sales figures last year, LVMH characterised its outlook in the following terms:

""In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the Group is confident in the continuation of its growth and will maintain a strategy focused on continuously enhancing the desirability of its brands, drawing on the authenticity and quality of its products, excellence in distribution and agile organization.""

Expect more of the same for 2024.

What to Watch For: LVMH Sales and Profits

After a solid first half in 2023, when sales grew 17% on a like-for-like basis, revenue growth sharply decelerated in the third quarter at +9%. In Q4, consensus expects total revenue of €23.62 billion (£20.2 billion), growing at 8.6% organically.

Fashion & Leather, which houses Louis Vuitton and Christion Dior and has been the main driver in growth and earnings for many years, has also seen its growth decelerating.

In the final quarter of 2023, analysts expect the division to grow 9% on a like-for-like basis. Some analysts are more bullish than others, seeing growth rebounding, in part thanks to easier basis of comparison in China.

For the full year, LVMH is expected to report total sales of €85.74 billion, an operating profit of €22.49 billion and net income of €15.70 billion (compared with €79.18 billion, €21.06 billion and €14.08 billion in 2022 respectively).

Fair Value Estimate for LVMH

Morningstar analyst Jelena Sokolova recently upgraded her Fair Value Estimate (FVE) for LVMH to €670 from €640 per share, to incorporate the time value of money ""offset by slightly more pessimistic expectations for 2023 sales and profits.""

""We expect Louis Vuitton brand to grow 3% faster than the luxury leather goods supported by an outsize marketing budget, brand recognition, and pricing power"", she wrote in a report dated January 8. In 2023, the fashion and leather good division should grow 7% and report an operating margin of 40%, compared with 20% and 40.6% respectively in 2022.

Key Morningstar Metrics

• Fair Value Estimate: €670;

• Current Price: €661;

• Morningstar Rating: ★★★;

• Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide;

• Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium.

Is Luxury Slowing Down?

After years of double-digit growth, the slowdown in luxury market and more cautious consumers in the US and Europe have weighed on the momentum for many luxury companies, with few exceptions like Hermes.

One important question for LVMH is what is the ""new normal"" in terms of organic growth and profit margins going forward?

Pricing should help fuel some growth and protect margins, and the company should be able to continue enjoying its favourable business mix towards Fashion & Leather, thanks to its continuous investments in marketing and in retail channels.

Yet despite somewhat easier basis for comparison in Q4 of 2022 (mostly due to China's lockdowns), analysts don’t expect growth to reaccelerate.

This has translated in a compression in valuation multiples, from a peak of 27.6 times expected earnings in April 2023, when it reached an all-time high of €901 a share to 21.3 times currently.

LVMH – Wide Moat Rating

We believe LVMH's portfolio of leading brands spanning multiple industries will allow it to generate economic profits for years to come. It scores highly on most of our brand intangible asset supporting criteria. Most brands in LVMH's portfolio are at least 100 years old.

The flagship Louis Vuitton brand is among the best known and recognised luxury brands with strong market share (double the next biggest peer in leather goods according to Euromonitor) and a strong track record of pricing power. The brand generates around three fourths of its revenue from iconic bags and low-double-digit percentages in accessories, where product cycles are long (reducing product and fashion risks and encouraging people to spend more for a product they will use longer), and scale allows to generate very attractive margins (usually in excess of 40%). Recurring buyers represent around a half of Louis Vuitton’s revenue, somewhat reducing revenue cyclicality.

LVMH's portfolio of watch brands is made up of midrange and high-end brands, with average prices of €2,000 and up. LVMH also has a strong position in branded jewelry with the Bulgari and Tiffany brands, which is among the leading players in the industry, where we consider entry barriers to be higher than other luxury goods, thanks to the high value attached to raw materials, low availability to communicate the brand, stickier gifting demand, and need for quality assurance on the top end.

In perfumes and cosmetics, LVMH has around 10% global market share, with a strong heritage in fragrances (notably Christian Dior and Guerlain). In wines and spirits, it commands leading market share in attractive conspicuous niches. It has over 20% global and 30% export market share in Champagnes with such brands as Moët & Chandon, Dom Perignon, and Ruinart, and it has undisputed global leadership (half of the market) in cognacs with flagship Hennessy.

Louis Vuitton Sees Spectacular Growth

We assign LVMH a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Medium. Luxury goods growth over the past 15 years has been fueled by emerging markets demand linked to China's economic development. This makes industry growth vulnerable to future structural and cyclical growth in this region.

Recent growth for Louis Vuitton has been spectacular (doubling in revenue from 2018 to 2022 from around €10 billion to around €20 billion) and faster than its historical pace, thanks to favorable cyclical demand environment, brand investments, pricing, and strong brand momentum. Slower demand for luxury goods overall and an adverse fashion cycle could further limit the brand's growth on an increasingly challenging comparison base.

Deceleration of demand from European and American customers, who spent record amounts on luxury in the years since Covid-19, was helped by savings from foregone experience spending, solid asset markets, and payment checks in the US Chinese demand, dampened by weak real estate prices and slower GDP growth, may not compensate for this slowdown.

While the firm's overall record of mergers and acquisitions is quite successful, in our view, there remains a risk of overpaying or choosing a target poorly. Acquisitions can also drift the group into less moaty and more competitive areas.

A large portion of production and administrative costs is incurred in euros, while almost 80% of revenue is invoiced in other currencies. In addition, given the global pricing transparency that the internet has made possible, adjusting pricing for currency movements has become more challenging. While LVMH has historically been able to pass through currency-related cost increases to consumers, this may prove more difficult in a weaker demand situation."

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne is:

28% = €17b ÷ €59b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each €1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made €0.28 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's Earnings Growth And 28% ROE

To begin with, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Even when compared to the industry average of 29% the company's ROE is pretty decent. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 23% net income growth seen by LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.

Next, on comparing LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 23% over the last few years.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is MC worth today? The helps visualize whether MC is currently mispriced by the market.

Is LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a three-year median payout ratio of 44% (where it is retaining 56% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.

Additionally, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 47%.

Conclusion

LVMH's Steady Holiday Growth Offers Reassuring Signal For Luxury - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWx2bWgtZWFybmluZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – Is no bad news good news? Analysts and investors at LVMH’s annual results presentation Thursday expressed relief as the luxury industry’s biggest player expressed tempered optimism regarding the length and severity of the industry’s current slowdown.

Chairman Bernard Arnault said he expected macroeconomic conditions for the luxury sector to improve despite the growing risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East.

“I anticipate that the economy will mostly move in a good direction for our products,” he said. “I’m relatively confident a solution will be found [in the Middle East], but we do have to be prepared for if the situation should degrade.”

LVMH reported sales that beat estimates, rising 10 percent on an organic basis in the fourth-quarter. Analysts had forecast 8 percent growth according to an average estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year sales topped €86 billion ($93 billion).

The French group’s selective retailing unit was the fastest-growing division, with sales rising 21 percent as businesses like Sephora, Hong-Kong based tax-free shopping giant DFS and Belmond Hotels were lifted by the easing of Covid-era travel restrictions.

Fashion and leather goods, the company’s biggest and most profitable division comprising mega-brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior and fast-growing houses like Celine and Loewe, reported sales up 9 percent, in line with the previous quarter.

The news that LVMH’s fashion brands had maintained a stable pace of growth during the pivotal holiday season— rather than posting a feared further slowdown — will likely be well received by investors. The results “demonstrate LVMH’s defensiveness on revenues and margins … with the diversified business model once again delivering consistent and stable earnings growth despite moderating trends,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania said in a note to clients.

Following a post-pandemic surge, growth has slowed sharply for the luxury sector in 2023, with many brands entering negative territory in the second half of the year. While Cartier- and Van Cleef-owner Richemont reported strong growth during the holiday quarter, as did top-end clothier Brunello Cucinelli, weaker brands haven’t fared as well. Burberry reported a 4 percent drop in same-store sales last quarter. Thursday, Ferragamo said full-year sales had fallen by more than 8 percent at constant currency compared to 2022.

At LVMH, full-year operating profit grew 8 percent to €22.8 billion euros ($24.7 billion).

Arnault recognised Louis Vuitton’s new CEO Pietro Beccari and menswear creative Pharrell for the brand’s strong performance in their first year, as well as womenswear designer Nicolas Ghesquìere, whose contract was recently renewed. A smiling, smartphone camera-wielding Arnault was evidently captivated at Pharrell’s star-studded menswear show last week, and seems to have brushed off critiques suggesting the designs were unsophisticated.

“It’s important to remember that Louis Vuitton isn’t a fashion business. It’s a business where we wanted to put some fashion into it starting in 1995,” he said. Pharrell’s emphasis on reinterpreting and celebrating historic products alongside proposing highly wearable new designs has clearly landed well with Arnault.

For other fast-growing brands like Loro Piana — a major winner in last year’s push toward logo-free luxury — and Christian Dior Couture, where sales have more than tripled in five years, Arnault said the group was preparing for slower growth at around 8 to 10 percent per year.

“The goal isn’t to have growth at any cost. I’m happy to pump the brakes a bit now rather than to end up pushing the cart.”

LVMH said it does not plan any significant price hikes this year.

Amid economic uncertainty and election-year retail gloom in the US, analysts see rebounding sales to Chinese clients as the most likely source of upside for the luxury sector. While LVMH’s slight beat on revenues won’t be interpreted by markets as spectacular, investors may embrace signs of steady improvement in the company’s Chinese business.

Sales to Chinese clients both domestically and abroad are steadily improving as the company annualises last year’s strict coronavirus lockdowns and as tourism picks back up.

Despite the fact that package tours have not made a comeback, sales to Chinese customers in Europe have recovered to around 70 percent of 2019 levels, the company said. As travel restrictions eased last year, the ranks of wealthy Chinese travellers who travel more independently swelled.

“Were not that far off 2019 levels with the Chinese at some brands like Vuitton in Europe. But it’s not the same clients, they’re not from the same places or buying the same things,” chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said. “We don’t expect the tour groups to come back tomorrow but we still manage to do an activity with the Chinese in Europe that’s perfectly significant.”

In Mainland China, the group hopes to fuel growth through a faster pace of store openings.

“The sales per square metre are really high; we’re at the maximum of what we can do while still offering a satisfying experience to our clients,” Arnault said. “As in the rest of the world, we’re focused on how we can buy really special locations.”

LVMH announced Thursday that two more of Arnault’s five children, watch executive Frédéric and Tiffany & Co. executive Alexandre, would join the company’s board, joining older siblings Delphine and Antoine (who lead Dior Couture and LVMH’s group communications, respectively). Former AXA CEO Henri de Castries is also set to join the board

In a meeting with analysts and press, however, the 74 year-old chairman and CEO said he had no plans to retire, “neither in the short or long term.”

Arnault also fired back at suggestions that the group would ever break up its various units. “In no case would we ever do any kind of spin-off, that would be a mistake. The group is built on a diversity of brands,” he said."

SEANA SMITH: LVMH shares rocketing higher this morning. Seeing fourth quarter organic revenue climbed 10% from a year ago. Moet Louis Vitton also raising its annual dividend. And similar to what we were just talking about with Amex, this is another company that's showing that the consumer is still out there spending. And specifically here with LVMH, there was a little bit of hesitancy or trepidation, maybe, I should say, going into this quarter here, going into these results, Brad, that we would see a further deterioration given the fact that maybe there were some trends heading into the holiday season that people have been pulling back on some of the higher end spending.

But when you take a look at these results, it's really certainly is putting any of those fears at rest. It is important to point out that there is some analyst commentary out there this morning-- Morningstar being amongst them-- saying that, hey, we're not out of the woods just yet. But, yes, this is a very strong report here for the broader sector.

BRAD SMITH: It's a different consumer too. When you think about LVMH and who they're typically marketing to, it's typically more high affluent, has a propensity to spend even in a compressed or pressured economy, I should say. And so when we think about where they're still seeing strong organic revenue growth, it's coming in across all business groups, except for wine and spirits. And, ultimately, they saw market share gains worldwide here.

Story continues

But it's also worldwide where they're seeing some of that growth. They saw double-digit organic revenue growth in Europe, Japan, the rest of Asia, as well. And growth in champagne actually driven, they said, by some of the value strategy. And a transitional year for cognac after two years of strong growth. Maybe they should talk to Shannon Sharpe on that. He could help them out.

But anyway, fragrances-- we talk about these little luxuries. Fragrances doing well. Strong momentum there. And that is an area that I think a lot of investors would be apt to pay close attention to over the course of this earnings season, when we hear even more from some of the retailers that carry even some of the mid-tier to lower tier fragrances. And, of course, self-care Sunday trade, if you will. That's going to be, particularly, noteworthy because it's all of the areas that customers are still willing to, perhaps, pay for that little luxury, and, in order to still have that retail therapy at the end of the day, too.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And you see it reflected in the share prices too, right?

BRAD SMITH: It is. Yeah, absolutely.

SEANA SMITH: Excitement this morning."
TikTok Wants to Work With LVMH to Get Fake Luxury Goods off the App - Robb Report,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvdGlrdG9rLWx2bWgtZmFrZS1nb29kcy0xMjM1NDcxMjgyL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvdGlrdG9rLWx2bWgtZmFrZS1nb29kcy0xMjM1NDcxMjgyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TikTok has finally gotten into the e-commerce game, and it’s hoping to work with some pretty big names in the luxury world to make sure its experiments are a success.

The app is in talks with LVMH about a plan that would see the two work together to limit the amount of fake goods sold on TikTok, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. LVMH, Europe’s largest luxury company, oversees dozens of brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany & Co., and TAG Heuer.

The goal is to create an “elevated shopping experience,” Toto Haba, the senior vice president of global omni-marketing for the LVMH-owned Benefit Cosmetics, told Bloomberg. “It’s important for us to guard our IP … TikTok and ByteDance seem much more willing to talk with us on that and set the right guardrails.”

A spokesperson for Benefit reached out to Robb Report to clarify that Haba is only speaking on behalf of the cosmetics brand, adding that LVMH is not pursuing a partnership with TikTok. LVMH does have a similar agreement in place with Alibaba, though, in which the two work together to remove counterfeit goods from the Tmall marketplace. When fake products are sold to consumers on a certain platform—a deceptive practice to begin with—it can give brands pause from selling on that platform, since it can decrease the value of the actual product.

WATCH

On TikTok, which launched shopping in the United States last year, users can buy items directly through videos or via a tab that’s laid out like a more traditional online-shopping site. Some brands have been early to the party, like Benefit and the fashion retailer Revolve, but many have been more hesitant to hawk their wares on the app. TikTok, though, is trying to entice brands to sell with them, and the app is hoping to increase its American e-comm business to $17.5 billion this year, 10 times its current value, Bloomberg has reported.

While it’s always the safest bet to buy directly from a retailer creating a given product, third-party sellers can list items on TikTok, and pre-owned items can be sold as well. While Louis Vuitton doesn’t sell its products on the app, for example, LV-branded accessories still pop up, and many appear when you search for the misspelled “Luis” Vuitton, according to Bloomberg. This potential partnership with LVMH would ideally clean up those dubious LV bags.

Maybe someday soon, you’ll even be able to buy a Speedy direct from a Louis Vuitton video on TikTok. The future really has arrived."

Frédéric Arnault Named CEO of LVMH Watches - HYPEBEAST,"Fri, 05 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzEvZnJlZGVyaWMtYXJuYXVsdC1uYW1lZC1jZW8tbHZtaC13YXRjaGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is strengthening its timepiece sector with the appointment of Frédéric Arnault as CEO of LVMH Watches.

From Bulgari to TAG Heuer: The Top Watch Releases from LVMH Watch Week - Robb Report,"Mon, 29 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2dhbGxlcnkvYnVsZ2FyaS1odWJsb3QtdGFnLWhldWVyLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtbHZtaC13YXRjaC13ZWVrLTEyMzU0OTEwODIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Watch Week kicked off yesterday in Miami. The annual event, which began in 2019 in Dubai just ahead of the pandemic, has meant the luxury conglomerate is the first in the watch industry to launch new releases. It’s a wise and strategic move for the company to flex its timepieces in a major press moment, while the rest of the industry generally waits until Watches & Wonders in April in Geneva.

“The concept was actually founded by Bulgari, by [Jean] Christophe [Babin],” said Frédéric Arnault, the newly minted CEO of LVMH’s watch division, at a poolside cocktail event at the W Hotel. “Initially, it was to really kickstart the year. It started with three brands from LVMH: Bulgari, Hublot, and Zenith. I’m proud to say it grew over time from how successful it was. It’s a great moment for all of our watch brands. It shows the strength and ambition of the group, LVMH. It is such an important category in the luxury world.”

This year, the event included six brands under the watch division: Bulgari, Daniel Roth, Gérald Genta, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith. Notably absent were Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co., two of LVMH’s largest brands that carry watches. It’s no secret that watches are a big push at both, particularly Louis Vuitton, but rumor has it that they’ll join next year’s edition. As far as this year’s participants go, the releases were mostly subdued with tweaks to existing models in new dial colors or case materials, such as a new green Hublot Big Bang SAXEM or a new sunray blue dial for the 18-karat yellow gold Octo Finissimo. Others, like the Daniel Roth Tourbillon Souscription timepiece—a tour de force revival of the revered brand—had already been released to the press last year. Nevertheless, the week is more about drumming up a big press moment at the start of the year, ahead of every other watch conglomerate and brand in the industry. And, set against a backdrop of a white-pillared mansion on Miami’s ultra-exclusive Star Island overlooking the city’s turquoise waters glistening beneath the warm sun and 80 degrees in January, it certainly stands apart from the bustling stress of Watches & Wonders in chilly Geneva.

Hublot Big Bang Unico SAXEM Green Image Credit: Hublot Hublot’s well-funded research and development division continues to make good on its commitment to find ways to add new color to watchmaking’s most high-tech case materials, specifically ceramic and SAXEM, Hublot’s proprietary variation of sapphire crystal. Fans of the exuberantly colorful brand will remember last year’s launch of Sapphire Aluminum oXide and rare Earth Mineral, or SAXEM for short, in neon yellow. It’s a sapphire crystal-like substance that Hublot figured out how to infuse with a combination of minerals to create a fluorescent color that glows like neon. This year it reappears in green, which is emerging as the year’s hottest color in watches. Like sapphire, SAXEM is transparent, so you can see the movement, the HUB1280 flyback chronograph, through the case side. For contrast, it is openworked and blackened, so the dial contrasts with the green case – calling to mind a popular look in jewelry design, the pairing of green garnet with blackened gold. The difference between sapphire and SAXEM, explains Hublot, is that Sapphire has a trigonal (three-sided) structure, while SAXEM has a cubic (four-sided) form.” Hence the more intense color, like a gem with more facets. The material does not receive light, but creates the illusion of emitting it. It’s large size – 42mm – enhances the drama. SAXEM was first used in 2019 in a similar shade of emerald green on the Big Bang MP-11. An integrated rubber strap is perfectly matched to the case, as is the green lume on the hands. Hublot will make 100 pieces. Price: $116,000, 100 pieces.

Case Material: SAXEM

Case Size: 42mm x 14.5mm

Hublot Classic Fusion Tourbillon Orlinski Image Credit: Hublot Hublot’s Classic Fusion Orlinski series has had a minimalist and muted aesthetic, with white or black dials and a slightly bolder royal blue ceramic version. This year it has been infused with a renewed sense of color that doesn’t detract from the artist’s sculptural design so much as transform it. The design is stark and angular, with time only, plus seconds, leaving the faceted dial and bezel to deliver all the drama. This year the drama is in the color. The Classic Fusion Tourbillon Orlinski appears in scorching-sun yellow or clear-sky blue versions, both infused in ceramic, inching them even closer to the dramatic pop art sculptures created by Hublot’s collaborator on the series, French artist Richard Orlinski. The architectural style of the watch carries over here to the openworked movement, the manually wound HUB6021 tourbillon, with faceted bridges coated in black PVD for the yellow version and silver rhodium for the blue version. There will be 30 pieces of each model. Price: $95,000, 30 pieces

Case Material: Ceramic

Case Size: 45mm x 10.6mm

Hublot MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium Image Credit: Hublot Hublot is a young brand, founded in 1980, compared to most top Swiss watch brands, which were founded about 100 years earlier. It therefore has a singular claim to post-modern watchmaking and design, free from the shackles of upholding the classical traditions of watchmaking. It has proposed instead to take watchmaking into the future. Its masterpiece line, or MP, thus has one goal: to reinvent existing complications. The MP-10, the brand’s tenth MP takes on the tourbillon. It has no dial, no hands and no oscillating weight (even though it’s automatic). The 592-component movement was five years in development and works on a system of aluminum rollers and a vertical winding system. Time is read from top to bottom on four constantly rotating displays: Hours on top, followed by minutes, a red/green power reserve disk, and lastly seconds, rotating on the 60-second tourbillon. The seconds take prominence over the tourbillon, since the escapement is angled at 35 degrees and thus largely out of sight. “There is a chronometric reason why the tourbillon is angled – the fact is that 35 degrees in different positions is a bit technically more accurate, but here the reason for the angle position of the tourbillon, explains Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe, “is aesthetics – we wanted to make the seconds very visible.” In case there is any misunderstanding about which functions are where, each is spelled out on bridges above or below each index. The case is made of two pieces—a middle and a back—in micro-blasted titanium, with a sapphire crystal wrapped on three inclined planes on three axes. Hublot has a patent pending for this configuration, its most complex to date. The rotor is not a rotor at all, since it doesn’t rotate. It works on a verticalized weight principle with two blocks of white gold that move up and down, winding the movement bidirectionally. Shock absorbers prevent them from colliding at each end. The system, which delivers 48 hours of power reserve, is also pending a patent pending. “We always try to reinvent some aspect of watchmaking in our MP creations, and here, we have tried to reinvent the self-winding system,” says Guadalupe. “We believe that the movement is part of the design of the watch today, so we try to display complication mechanics in a different way to be innovative.” There are two crowns, neither of which rests in the traditional 3 o’clock position. The massive crown at 12 o’clock winds the watch. Time is set using a second crown nestled on the caseback side “to preserve the fluidity of the design,” explains the Hublot release.

Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Jewelry Image Credit: Hublot As a modern brand, Hublot has always had an uninhibited sense of the jewelry watch, more red-carpet bling than aristocratic classicism. This year’s Big Bang Jewelry collection includes a can’t-miss-it Rainbow model – the first of Hublot’s signature multi-colored sapphire pieces to appear in the barrel-cased Spirit of Big Bang collection. There are two versions, one in steel and the other in King Gold, Hublot’s proprietary warm red gold alloy. Each set with 493 multi-colored gems. Likewise, there are both steel and King Gold versions of the new Spirit of Big Bang Full Pavé showstoppers. Each is fully set with diamonds on the bezel, case, and dial, with a whopping 479 brilliant-cut gems totaling just over 2 carats. Hublot has even calculated the number of facets which adds up to: 27,782 per watch, with each of those facets reflecting light like a klieg light. They are accompanied by black or white rubber straps.



Prices:

Steel Full Pave: $34,600

King Gold Full Pave: $46,200

Steel Rainbow: $72,600

King Gold Rainbow: $80,000

Case Material: King Gold, steel

Case Size: 32mm x 11.10mm









Bulgari Octo Finissimo Image Credit: Bulgari If these two models look familiar, that’s because they were officially launched in the U.S. market last year, but now Bulgari is announcing a global offering. The steel model with the Tuscan copper dial remains the same as the model that was initially released stateside last year in a limited run of 50. The 18-karat yellow gold model, however now comes dressed in a blue sunray dial. Its 2023 release in the U.S. came with a chocolate brown dial. There’s nothing groundbreaking here. This model has already done enough trailblazing—the Octo Finissimo has set eight world records. The steel model is the most appealing with the coolness of the metal paired with the soft warmth of copper, but while yellow gold might seem rather bold on a watch with such a wide bracelet it’s not as overpowering as you might assume in person. A female Bulgari representative who was wearing the piece on her wrist at LVMH Watch Week made a compelling case for the yellow gold version, while also proving that even at 40 mm, this watch’s ergonomics somehow make the sizing work even on smaller wrists. Price: $45,500 in Yellow Gold and $13,300 in Steel

Case Material: 18-karat Yellow Gold or Steel

Case Size: 40 mm x 6.4 mm

Bulgari Lucea Image Credit: Bulgari The Lucea collection is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, so Bulgari naturally had to bring an ultra-special model to the table. The most striking new Lucea is the rich malachite dial version which was made with scraps of the stone material leftover from other watch models in the Bulgari manufacture. Instead of throwing away the tiny fragments, the company put them to use in a beautiful marquetry compilation. The varying hues of green create an arresting pattern accented by brilliant-cut diamond hour markers and encircled by a bezel adorned with 56 diamonds. The malachite pairs nicely with the two-tone case and bracelet in steel and 18-karat rose gold, as well as the ruby crystal crown protector. It is, by far, the most outstanding Lucea release of the year (so far). Price: TBC

Case Material: Steel and 18-karat Rose Gold

Case Size: 33 mm x 9.6 mm

La Fabrique du Temps X Gérald Genta Manufacture Calibre GG-001 Image Credit: Gerald Genta Forty years after famed watch designer Gérald Genta first defied the highly traditional watch industry by putting Mickey Mouse on a watch dial, La Fabrique du Temps is resurrecting this playful design as it relaunches the brand. And for those of you who scoff at the idea of a Disney-themed timepiece, kindly consider the type of watch we’re talking about: The new GG-001 is no simple time-only piece, but a minute repeater with a jump hour and retrograde minutes display developed by the horological illuminati at La Fabrique du Temps itself. Housed in a 32.4mm case that measures just 6.91mm thick, it has an impressive 80-hour power reserve and a beautiful dial graved by everyone’s favorite mouse: At 3 o’clock is a magnified jump-hour window, while Mickey’s left arm serves as the minute hand along a retrograde track running along the dial’s periphery. Playful yet subtle, this creative integration of multiple complications is an impressive feat of watchmaking — one that will be appreciated by both die-hard “watch nerds” and those whose taste runs more toward compelling aesthetics. (Not to mention by Disney fans everywhere!) Price: TBD

La Fabrique du Temps X Daniel Roth Tourbillon Souscription Image Credit: Daniel Roth Since 2000, the Daniel Roth brand has been owned by Bulgari, which was itself acquired by LVMH in 2011. Now, the eponymous maison founded by the famed French-born watchmaker has been revived with the involvement of La Fabrique du Temps, the LVMH-owned movement manufacture founded by star horologists Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini. The first product to see the light of day will certainly delight Daniel Roth fans: The new Tourbillon Souscription is an homage to the ref. 2187/C187, Roth’s first model. Housed in the watchmaker’s famed double-ellipse case, it takes inspiration from the designs of 18th/19th-century watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, with exquisite finishing and the integration of remarkable complications. Extremely limited in production, the new timepiece features a solid-gold guilloché dial, a new in-house movement, and an impressively thin case depth of just 9.2mm. With its visible tourbillon cage and retrograde display, it’s truly a piece of horological art, and bodes well for the reconstitution of this important marque. Price: TBD

TAG Heuer Plasma Diamant Image Credit: TAG Heuer Just when you think the cutting edge of tool watch design means a tourbillon in your chronograph, TAG Heuer hits you with one of these: A sports watch positively encrusted in diamonds like the bottom of a caïque off the coast of Paros. The new TAG Heuer Carrera Date Plasma Diamant is merely the latest in a series of timepieces featuring lab-grown diamonds, whose uniform color is achieved via a Chemical Vapor Deposition technology that the brand calls “Plasma.” In this instance, rather than set diamonds throughout the case of a larger 44mm watch such that of as last year’s Carrera Plasma Diamond d’Avant Garde, TAG Heuer has taken its 36mm, time-only version of the Carrera and jazzed it up: Fashioned from white gold, it features a 2.9-carat polycrystalline dial with baguette-cut diamond indices; a yellow gold TAG Heuer shield logo; and a 1.3-carat yellow diamond crown. The interplay between the case material, sparkling dial, and bright pops of yellow is striking without being gaudy — a difficult feat to achieve with this many precious stones. Price: TBD

TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon Image Credit: TAG Heuer Launching alongside the aforementioned “Dato” model is a similarly teal-colored Carrera Chronograph in Tourbillon form, with a dual-register chronograph layout accompanied by Abraham-Louis Brguet’s famed invention visible at 6 o’clock. Developed by the famed French watchmaker in the early 19th century, the tourbillon is a horological device that places the movement’s escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage, which helps negate the effects of gravity on a pocket watch movement. Nowadays, the inclusion of a tourbillon is a way for a watch company to show its expertise in movement construction, which TAG Heuer does here to good effect. Joined by 30-minute and 12-hour chronograph totalizers and easily visible beneath a curving “glassbox” sapphire crystal, the tourbillon in question is part of the TAG Heuer Calibre TH20-09 movement, which features bi-directional winding and a high level of finishing. Housed in a 42mm stainless steel “glassbox” Carrera case and paired to a black alligator leather strap, the TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon is a high-end riff on a beloved sports watch.

TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Image Credit: Tag Heuer Jack Heuer, great-grandson of company founder Edouard Heuer, launched his famous racing chronograph in 1963, naming it after the Carrera Panamericana, a notoriously dangerous road race that took place in Mexico in the early 1950s. (And which also inspired the nickname of a certain Porsche.) Since then, the Carrera has taken on many guises, receiving a complete refresh in the form of the (still relatively new) “Glassbox” references launched in 2023 — just in time for the model’s 60th anniversary. This year, TAG Heuer is reviving a perennial fan favorite in the form of a new “Dato” model, which features a single, 30-minute chronograph totalizer at 9 o’clock and a date window at 9 o’clock. Hearkening back to a moderately rare Carrera variant from 1968, the new chrono marks the first time this unique date arrangement has appeared within the “Glassbox” case, which measures 39mm and features a curved inner flange housing a 1/5th-second track, all of which is enveloped by a gently curving “glassbox” crystal. With its striking, teal green dial and pared-down aesthetic, it’s sure to bridge the gap between fans of vintage Heuer and more casual watch buyers. Price: $6,550

Zenith Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar Image Credit: Zenith Most watch brands, when they announce the re-issue of a vintage design, are quick to include a note that while the design may be true to the original, the watch now contains a modern, in-house movement. In Zenith’s case, the movement was already there. The high-frequency El Primero caliber contained in the new Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar is a direct evolution of the one designed in 1969. In fact, the original El Primero movement was designed to accommodate triple calendar and moon phase functions right from the very beginning. Zenith made a small series of 25 prototypes in 1970 as a proof of concept, but the watch was not produced commercially until later in the 1970s, and even then, it was a different style than the prototype. The model being reissued this year, mirroring the prototype design, was never released at all. The new Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar is therefore technically the first. The homage version is a tribute to the original movement, and its design is true to the signature A386 chronograph case design from 1969. The dial architecture mirrors the chronograph design codes – from a distance, you might have to do a second take to notice the Triple Calendar is not a chronograph-only. Days of the week and months are displayed in subtle windows above the east/west subdials – with small seconds at 9 o’clock and 60-second counter at 3 o’clock. The date window is in the traditional El Primero position at 4:30, and the moonphase display is incorporated right into the chronograph’s 60-minute counter at 6 o’clock. The movement is an adapted version of the El Primero 3610, an improved version of the original triple calendar movement, with improved gearing and added stop seconds mechanism. It runs at 36,000 vph to deliver a 1/10th of a second chronograph function. Even with the addition of the complete calendar, it has a power reserve of approximately 60 hours. There are two regular versions, one with a sporty silvery-white panda opaline dial with black counters and 1/100th of a second scale, and an opaline slate-gray dial with silvery-white counters and scale that is directly inspired by the small series of El Primero triple calendar prototypes from 1970. A third, boutique-only variant has a sunburst olive-green dial. All have rose gold-tone applied baton markers and hands, to match the polished rose gold moon.

Zenith Chronomaster Sport Image Credit: Zenith Having perfected the El Primero movement over the past 55 years, Zenith is now ready to have a little fun with the design of its flagship chronograph—but not so much that it obliterates the signature look. Two new versions include a first-ever gem-set Chronomaster Sport and an all-green model with a first-ever green ceramic bezel. Both models retain the signature tri-color subdials of the Chronomaster in the familiar shades of gray and blue. The background dial of the green version is lacquered green to match the ceramic bezel and there’s a green FKM rubber strap to switch out the steel bracelet. The green is a vibrant, almost neon color that is emerging as a strong watch color, and it works surprisingly well with the tri-color subdials. In a way, it’s back by popular demand. “We launched a green Chronomaster Sport Aaron Rogers [NFL quarterback and Zenith ambassador] watch last fall, and all 250 pieces sold out immediately. People loved it, especially the green ceramic bezel, which not a lot of brands do. So it inspired us to come back with this one,” says Zenith CEO Benoit de Clerck. For the jeweled Chronomaster Sport, Zenith leans in even closer to the tri-color aesthetic by setting the bezel with baguette-cut gems to match the signature subdial colors. There are white diamonds, black spinels (which read dark gray), and gray and blue sapphires. “We had a request for this gemsetting,” says Zenith CEO, Benoit de Clerck. “It will never be a core collection, of course, but there is definitely a clientele for gold and gemstones. We will continue to make special editions like this.” On the jeweled Chronomaster Sport, Zenith leans in even closer to the tri-color aesthetic by setting the bezel with baguette-cut gems to match the subdials. There are white diamonds, black spinels (which read dark gray), and gray and blue sapphires. The dial is meteorite in the so-called “Windmanstätten” pattern (with long mineral crystals in geometric patterns), treated in a warm golden color that matches the 18k rose gold case and bracelet. It’s a very dressy version of the Chronomaster Sport that dovetails with the ongoing trend toward dressing up sports watches and sporting up dress watches, which often cry out for definition: are sporty dress or dressy sport watches? The tri-color chronograph registers, pump pushers, and El Primero 3600 movement tend to emphasize the sporty side of this one, but the precious gems and gold case elevate the watch to somewhere well beyond the race track. It’s your call.

Major Leadership Changes At TAG Heuer & Zenith Prior To LVMH Watch Week 2024 - aBlogtoWatch,"Sat, 06 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbWFqb3ItbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFuZ2VzLWF0LXRhZy1oZXVlci16ZW5pdGgtcHJpb3ItdG8tbHZtaC13YXRjaC13ZWVrLTIwMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In late January of 2024 in Miami (this year), LVMH will host its annual Watch Week event where media and guests are flown out from around the world to preview some of the hottest new timepieces from the major luxury group’s watchmakers including TAG Heuer, Zenith, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, and Bulgari. In addition to new products, LVMH has announced rather big changes to some of its leadership team, prompted by the promotion of Frederic Arnault. As the son (one of several children) of LVMH Group leader Bernard Arnault, Frederic Arnault now steps into the corporate management position, which his predecessor Stephane Bianchi at TAG Heuer stepped into when Arnault took the CEO position at TAG Heuer back in 2020.

Presumably, Mr. Bianchi is now out as CEO of LVMH Watches, making room for Frederic Arnault to step in. Unlike the more public and visible role of brand CEO, the head of LVMH Watches is more managerial, and less on the creative or product side. LVMH watch brand CEOs report directly to the CEO of the LVMH Watches Division, which will now be held by Frederic Arnault. With brand-running experience now under his belt, the presumption is that Frederic Arnault will continue to climb the responsibility and power ladder at the company. It is often pointed out that while among the “sexier” luxury products made by the LVMH Group, wristwatches nevertheless represent a relatively small portion of overall corporate earnings. Why then is there so much interest among the Arnault family members (not all of them of course) to actively manage this segment of LVMH products? The simple answer is “desire.” According to a number of insiders, watches are the most desirable (in terms of pricing, quality, complexity, etc.) object category that a luxury firm like LVMH can produce. There is a natural gravitation for the top leaders to actively oversee the development, marketing, and sale of “desire,” which is an intangible but is also probably the most important resource that a group like LVMH trades in.

With Frederic Arnault in the top position at the LVMH Watch Division, this leaves an opening at TAG Heuer to fill. Rumors last year already suggested that Zenith’s then-current CEO Julien Tornare would replace Mr. Arnault at TAG Heuer – which is exactly what happened. Julien Tornare was someone who originally came from Richemont but had a very successful time running the challenging Zenith brand. He was hired in 2017 when Jean-Claude Biver was still in a top-level leadership position at LVMH – who himself was an interim CEO of both TAG Heuer and Zenith for a while. According to Mr. Biver at the time, from a marketing perspective, Zenith was the hardest nut to crack. Mr. Tornare has thus done a very good job given the stakes and opportunities presented to him. His hard work has paid off, and now Mr. Tornare will enjoy greater resources and responsibility at TAG Heuer. The brand will be re-expanding its product portfolio in 2024, relaunching a product category (not watches) that was profitable for it in recent decades. Julien’s energy, enthusiasm, and creativity will be fully required at his new role as the CEO of TAG Heuer.

With Mr. Tornare leaving Zenith, that left another management opening to fill for LVMH. Once again, LVMH goes to Richemont and chooses a star player who has less often been in the spotlight to fill the CEO position at Zenith. Richemont has had a talent flight of late, with LVMH currently being seen by some as a more dynamic, stable, and creative place to work if you are interested in watches. Now Mr. Benoit de Clerck will be the CEO of Zenith, and he comes most recently from working a high-level sales management position at Panerai. I originally met Benoit when he was working at IWC some years back, although I have not experienced Mr. de Clerck in a CEO leadership role, so he has yet to reveal his style. He is smart and hardworking, with a penchant for practicality and performance. I am looking forward to speaking with him to understand what his plans are for Zenith, and how he feels about being at a new group after many years of being at Richemont.

What we really don’t know yet is how any of this news will affect consumers and translate into production changes or decisions. Given that Zenith released a lot of desirable products under Mr. Tornare’s tenure, there is great enthusiasm that TAG Heuer will likewise enjoy his prolific ability to focus on many different watch models and styles at the same time. Frederic Arnault has been a pragmatic and studied leader of TAG Heuer, but his larger ambitions for the LVMH Watches Division remain unknown. My guess is that his main focus will be to keep the LVMH watchmakers as competitive as possible, while ensuring that each of them comes out with headline-catching new products on a regular basis. He will no doubt want to make sure that appeal and visibility for the brands he oversees remain high over the next few years. Careful and cautious, I don’t think Benoit de Clerck will make any major immediate changes to Zenith from a product or sales perspective. My guess is that he will take a few years to study the market and overall brand performance, and then to choose trusted voices within his circle to rely upon for making product and other creative decisions. He does not strike me as someone who likes to rock the boat, as opposed to someone who wants to improve the system he inherits prior to making changes to it – but we will see.
