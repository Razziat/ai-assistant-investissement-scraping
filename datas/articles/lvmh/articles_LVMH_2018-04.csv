"No, LVMH is Not Looking to Take Over Chanel, Says Bernard Arnault - The Fashion Law","Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL25vLWx2bWgtaXMtbm90LWxvb2tpbmctdG8tdGFrZW92ZXItY2hhbmVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in acquisition talks with Chanel? The Paris-based conglomerate’s honcho Bernard Arnault explicitly said, no, on Thursday at the group’s annual shareholder meeting. It is unclear exactly where this rumor, which Arnault declared as “fake news,” originated. Although, there it is worth noting that highly-followed luxury analyst Luca Solca wrote in his column for BoF in February discussing what brands LVMH and Kering will acquire next that “an LVMH tie-up with Chanel” would be “striking.”

When asked to comment on rumors that an LVMH executive had met with members of the Wertheimer family, whose billionaire brothers Alain and Gérard together own the privately-held Chanel, to discuss a potential acquisition, Arnault shot down the suggestion on Thursday in Paris. According to Mr. Arnault, “Chanel is an outstanding business, but we are not in contact with them. I don’t know who told you that, but in my opinion, it is fake news. There’s a lot of that around, you know.”

As for Chanel, which, as WWD aptly noted, “rarely comments on market rumors, also dismissed the speculation,” its chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux told WWD in a statement: “We confirm that Chanel is not for sale and that these rumors are totally unfounded.”"
LVMH leads the luxury sector higher as Chinese demand propels sales - CNBC,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvMTAvbHZtaC1sZWFkcy10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci1oaWdoZXItYXMtY2hpbmVzZS1kZW1hbmQtcHJvcGVscy1zYWxlcy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTgvMDQvMTAvbHZtaC1sZWFkcy10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci1oaWdoZXItYXMtY2hpbmVzZS1kZW1hbmQtcHJvcGVscy1zYWxlcy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shares in LVMH hit record highs on Tuesday and the rally extended to its luxury goods rivals, after the owner of fashion labels like Christian Dior signaled strong momentum for the sector with better-than-expected first-quarter sales growth.

The upbeat start to the year for LVMH, the industry's biggest company, sets an encouraging tone for peers and points to enduring demand from Chinese consumers, which sustained strong earnings at many luxury firms last year.

LVMH, which derives the biggest slice of sales from its mega-brand Louis Vuitton, reported a 13 percent sales rise from a year earlier on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and sales and acquisitions.

That beat expectations for an increase of around 9 percent in the January-to-March period.

LVMH shares were up 5.2 percent in early session trading, touching record highs.

The shares of its French rival Kering, owner of Italian fashion brand Gucci, also briefly touched record highs and were trading 3.3 percent higher, while Britain's Burberry also climbed 1.7 percent.

""LVMH's results confirm the ongoing strong underlying trends in the market,"" analysts at Berenberg said in a note.

Rebounding Asian appetite for luxury goods, especially from a younger generation of shoppers comfortable with buying big-ticket items online, is a major motor for the industry.

But headwinds still lurk and investors have been seeking reassurance that the sector's revival was not running out of steam, especially as earnings comparisons against a strong 2017 may not be as favorable.

A strong euro is still a disadvantage, as it can put off foreign shoppers and can hurt sales made in other currencies and converted back into euros.

Currencies had a 10 percent negative impact on LVMH's sales in the first quarter, more than some analysts had expected, although some added that the company should be able to mitigate this risk in future by hiking prices.

Trade tensions between the United States and China, meanwhile, could have a knock-on effect on the sector if they hurt Chinese consumer sentiment, analysts at BNP Paribas said earlier this week."
Bernard Arnault Dismisses Rumor of LVMH Bid for Chanel as 'Fake News' - WWD,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1ydW1vcnMtbHZtaC1iaWQtY2hhbmVsLWZha2UtbmV3cy0xMjAyNjQ4MTU2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Following its failed bid for Hermès, could LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton be angling to snap up another independent competitor, Chanel?

Not so, said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, at the company’s annual general meeting in Paris on Thursday. The luxury titan, flanked by members of the group’s executive committee onstage, was responding to a query during the meeting’s question and answer session.

Asked to comment on rumors that a senior LVMH executive had met with members of the Wertheimer family, which controls Chanel, to explore an acquisition, Arnault said: “Chanel is an outstanding business, but we are not in contact with them. I don’t know who told you that, but in my opinion, it’s fake news. There’s a lot of that around, you know.”

Chanel, which rarely comments on market rumors, also dismissed the speculation. “We confirm that Chanel is not for sale and that these rumors are totally unfounded,” Chanel chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux said in a statement to WWD.

LVMH surprised markets in October 2010 when it revealed it had amassed a 17.1 percent stake in Hermès via cash-settled equity swaps that allowed it to circumvent the usual regulations requiring firms to declare share purchases. Over the next few years, it raised its stake to 23.2 percent.

The share acquisition triggered an investigation by France’s stock market regulator and a legal battle between the two companies, which eventually signed a truce in 2014 that saw LVMH distribute its Hermès stake to shareholders.

Alain and Gérard Wertheimer, the reclusive billionaire brothers who own Chanel, have never commented publicly on their strategy for the maker of 2.55 handbags and tweed jackets."
"The new luxury landscape: How Tiffany & Co., Gucci and LVMH are embracing digital transformation - ClickZ","Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrei5jb20vbmV3LWx1eHVyeS1sYW5kc2NhcGUtdGlmZmFueS1ndWNjaS1sdm1oLzIxNDExOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s no secret that some industries have embraced digital transformation faster than others. Luxury brands have typically been at the slower end of the scale. Ecommerce democratizes access to products and information. However, for brands like Tiffany & Co., Chanel and Gucci, exclusivity is a good thing.

Luxury brands trade on their names. The name “Louis Vuitton” evokes a certain craftsmanship, but more than that, those brown handbags are a status symbol. And in the brand’s eyes, purchasing one should be all about the experience, complete with white glove service that is hard to replicate online.

The problem for these brands is that wealthier consumers are doing more of their shopping online. According to last year’s Adobe Digital Price Index, the states with the biggest online shoppers—D.C., New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland—are among the states with the highest per capita incomes. Over the past five years, luxury brands have outpaced the global market in ecommerce growth, which is only going to accelerate. McKinsey & Company projects that ecommerce will make up 19% of the market by 2025, up from 8% in 2016.

Luxury brands have no choice but to embrace digital transformation. And here’s how five of them are doing it.

LVMH: Accelerating innovation

LVMH—the French conglomerate that includes brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Dom Pérignon and Sephora—recently announced an accelerator program for international start-ups. Participating companies’ areas of focus include chatbot customer service, visual recognition-based predictive technology, biometric wristwear and robotic technology that creates clothing customized for individual consumers’ bodies.

The start-ups will attend workshops about the unique challenges facing luxury retail. That gives them guidance in their innovations, while LVMH benefits from their technological solutions.

Gucci: Putting the “AR” in “art”

Imagination is a big part of luxury brands’ mystique. With Gucci’s spring campaign, consumers don’t have to picture themselves living a lavish lifestyle; they can actually do it. (Kind of.) Virtual and augmented reality are the centerpiece of Gucci Hallucination, which is based on the work of Spanish artist Ignasi Monreal.

It includes in-store AR and VR installations that allow consumers to be a part of the campaign. There are also scannable ads for the shoppers at home.

Chanel: Going all In(stagram)

One company in LVMH’s start-up accelerator developed an artificial intelligence solution that consumers can use to detect counterfeit products with their smartphones. Of course, “digital transformation” also includes simpler strategies. According to a recent study from PMX Agency, social media is one of the top sources of website traffic for luxury brands. And none of them do social better than Chanel, which boasts more Instagram followers than any other luxury brand.

Chanel’s Instagram maintains the brand’s aspirational image, with every photo looking like a magazine ad. But Chanel’s social media presence is just as much about function as it is about fashion. Following what the followers want, Chanel has since launched two additional accounts. One revolves around beauty products; the other is all about user-generated content, creating a sense of community.

Tiffany & Co.: Dominating the SERPs

Social media is the number two driver of website traffic, according to PMX Agency. Number one is Google, of course. Studying jewelry brand keywords for a summer, L2 Inc found that Tiffany & Co. “shines at keyword visibility.”

Compared with its competitors, Tiffany & Co. is the most visible on SERPs across every region L2 analyzed. When you Google “Tiffany,” the brand dominates the entire first page, with the exception of two links to Tiffany Glass galleries and the ’80s pop star’s Wikipedia page. Tiffany & Co. dominates Google’s Local 3-Pack. Regarding visual search, 48 of the first 50 images relate to the brand. Even if you search for “Tiffani,” you have to scroll through Tiffany & Co. ads to find out what Tiffani “Kelly Kapowski” Theissan is up to these days. (She’s one of the stars of a new Netflix show called Alexa and Katie, by the way.)

Neiman Marcus: Focusing on omnichannel

Neiman Marcus, where the aforementioned brands and many others live under one roof, received the 2017 IRT Retailer Innovation Award in Customer Engagement. Why? The department store has been hyper-focused on creating omnichannel shopping experiences, including a website that remembers customers’ sizes based on previous searches and personalized direct mail and email letting shoppers know that items they’ve been eyeing have arrived in their local store.

There’s also the “Memory Mirror” that allows consumers to take 360-degree videos of themselves trying on clothes; the videos live in-app to be perused later. And what may be the coolest one of all is “Snap. Find. Shop.” If you see an item you like, take a picture. Neiman Marcus’ app uses image recognition to serve up comparable products."

First-quarter sales rose 13 per cent on an organic basis, the Paris-based owner of Sephora and Christian Dior said on Monday after Paris markets closed.

LVMH set an upbeat tone for the luxury industry, ploughing ahead with double-digit sales growth that beat analysts’ estimates for the start of the year.

Prosperous Chinese consumers have been stocking up on LVMH’s Louis Vuitton handbags and Givenchy make-up, powering record sales last year for the company with the highest market value in France.

Gucci owner Kering and Birkin bag-maker Hermès International benefited, too.

While China’s economic growth is expected to slow to 6.5 per cent in 2018 compared with 6.9 per cent last year, according to forecast data compiled by Bloomberg, the strong sales show that demand for luxury products remains high.

“This is a remarkable start to the year for LVMH, with broad-based market share gains in a buoyant environment for luxury goods,” says Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Europe, who rates the shares the equivalent of buy, in a note to clients.

Digital Efforts

With more than 4,000 stores from Paris’s Avenue Montaigne to Los Angeles’s Rodeo Drive, LVMH is getting a boost from a rising Chinese middle class that is travelling more than ever.

Digital allows us to reach the client more quickly and directly. Innovation and creativity are fundamental values for LVMH Bernard Arnault, chairman LVMH

It’s also gaining from a push into e-commerce and new products to entice young consumers – such as luxury sneakers and iPhone cases styled like Louis Vuitton trunks.

LVMH highlighted its digital efforts, such as its sponsorship for a start-up accelerator that aims to encourage entrepreneurs developing new technologies and services for the luxury industry.

The programme is situated in Station F, a former Paris terminal that telecommunications billionaire Xavier Niel has turned into a sprawling campus for start-ups.

“Digital allows us to reach the client more quickly and directly,” says Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and France’s richest man, speaking at Monday’s inauguration ceremony for the accelerator. “Innovation and creativity are fundamental values for LVMH.”

LVMH moved to ramp up its e-commerce business across its stable of brands last year with new sites for its Celine handbags and Berluti shoes, the first online store in China for its largest brand, Louis Vuitton, and a new multibrand emporium called 24 Sevres.

“We’ve really seen progress across the board,” chief digital officer Ian Rogers says, pointing to the online openings as well as increased engagement on social-media platforms such as Instagram and China’s WeChat.

The company saw organic growth of 10 per cent or greater in categories such as spirits, fashion goods, cosmetics and jewellery.

LVMH Faces $10 Million Suit by Makeup Artist - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1mYWNlcy0xMC1taWxsaW9uLXN1aXQtYnktbWFrZXVwLWFydGlzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — LVMH is facing a $10 million lawsuit brought by makeup artist Sammy Mourabit, who claims that the French luxury group rescinded his contract offer to be the global artistic director of the ailing cosmetics brand Make Up For Ever after wooing him to join the company for one year and promising to pay him a $1 million-a-year salary. The complaint was filed late on April 9 in the United States district court for the southern district of New York.

Mourabit, who is best known for his theatrical editorial and advertising work with photographers Steven Klein and Patrick Demarchelier and celebrity clients including Madonna and Rihanna, is suing for ""fraudulent inducement to contract."" He claims LVMH executives repeatedly promised to hire him to with a start date of January 1, 2018, but reneged just months before he was due to take up the role.

Mourabit claims that the terms of a contract for him to replace Make Up For Ever founder and artistic director Dany Sanz were agreed in August 2017. But on October 27, Nicolas Cordier, chief executive of Make Up For Ever, telephoned him to say the offer was no longer on the table, Mourabit alleges.

When asked about the lawsuit Mourabit said: “I left major clients, major personal clients, with tremendous amounts of money lost and I did that for 12 months, turning down opportunities after opportunities, turning down fashion shows because I want to be able to work with them. It’s a bittersweet feeling, it’s sad, I’m still in shock.”

LVMH declined repeated requests for comment.

LVMH’s Make Up For Ever sits in a fast-moving beauty market where buzzy new brands, many of them digital-first and driven by social media, are challenging traditional players. Make Up For Ever is one of the smallest brands in LVMH’s cosmetics division, with annual sales of around €100 million, according to Zuzanna Pusz, associate director of equity research at Berenberg Bank. LVMH does not break out performance by brand.

“It feels like it hasn’t been too much of a focus” for LVMH, said Pusz. Mourabit alleges he was to “breathe new life” into the “faltering and flailing” brand. Cordier exited Make Up For Ever in December, just weeks after allegedly telling Mourabit LVMH was rescinding his contract offer. He was replaced by Rachel Marouani, the brand’s current chief executive.

“It’s a brand that is everywhere but is being overshadowed by flashier players such as Fenty, but also Instagram brands like Anastasia Beverley Hills that command more attention,” said Lisa Payne, senior beauty editor at trend forecaster Stylus, referring to Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty brand, launched in partnership with LVMH. “[Make Up For Ever]’s sticking point is that it struggles to speak above the noise. The Fenty launch is a good example. The hype generated around Fenty’s extended foundation portfolio almost created the impression that it was the first brand to offer such a big foundation shade line, but because of its history as a theatre and TV brand Make Up For Ever has had a 40-piece foundation offering since 2015. Fundamentally, it is a middle-of-the-road brand.”

Make Up For Ever’s cosmetics range targets performers, professional makeup artists and end consumers with a mix of technical and special effects ranges and advertising campaigns featuring the likes of transgender model Andreja Pejić, singer Jessie J and R&B artist Kehlani. Its 40 shades of $43 UltraHD foundation are sold at LVMH-owned beauty chain Sephora and over 2,200 stores globally.

Make Up For Ever was started by makeup artist Dany Sanz in 1984 and was bought by LVMH in 1999. Growth in LVMH’s cosmetics and perfume division, the group’s third largest unit by sales, climbed by 14 percent last year, buoyed by Christian Dior perfumes and Fenty, the company said.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

By Sarah White

PARIS (Reuters) - France's LVMH is fostering projects by entrepreneurs in the luxury goods sector, including a startup working with silkworms on new materials and another whose software might help detect counterfeits.

The Louis Vuitton owner on Monday unveiled a Paris-based startup program, which aims to support some 50 businesses a year by hosting them in a mega-campus where they can collaborate with its brands.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, is following in the footsteps of French cosmetics giant L'Oreal in grabbing a corner of Station F, a vast startup incubator in Paris where it offers rent-free space to the startups.

""The idea is to animate and activate those conversations around the things that might affect the luxury industry,"" said Ian Rogers, a former Apple music executive who joined LVMH in 2015 as chief digital officer.

Paris is among major European cities bidding to displace London's dominance in the startup scene as Britain's EU exit looms and President Emmanuel Macron pushes a pro-reform agenda designed to promote budding businesses and draw investment.

LVMH was for now concentrating its startup efforts on the French capital, Rogers added. ""It's our home, and it's in a unique moment right now,"" he said.

Station F was launched last year by French billionaire Xavier Niel, who is also the partner of Delphine Arnault, an executive at Vuitton and daughter of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault.

Luxury and beauty firms are increasingly interested in tech projects, as they do more business online and use apps that allow customers to try out products, and many are investing in new fabrics or connected objects too.

LVMH, which also owns fashion label Christian Dior and champagne house Moet & Chandon, did not disclose how much it was spending on Its Station F venture, which kicked off in November but was formally unveiled on Monday.

Rogers did not rule out that LVMH or its venture capital arm could invest in some of the startups later on, though said there were no immediate plans to support the firms financially.

Story continues

LVMH on Monday posted a better-than-expected rise in first quarter sales, boosted by strong demand from Chinese consumers.

Many of the startups have already had some contact with LVMH or other luxury brands but want to grow their reach.

Clara Hardy, co-founder of Sericyne, which has patented a new technique allowing silkworms to spin shapes onto moulds, said the firm had designed decorative watch faces using the material, for instance, and had more projects in the works.

""Our business still has a lot of commercial development to do,"" said Hardy, 28.

The space will serve as a year-round physical base for a curated community of start-ups developed through various initiatives implemented by LVMH since the arrival of the group’s chief digital officer Ian Rogers two and a half years ago.

LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault on Monday led a select group of journalists on a tour of the area — measuring around 2,400 square feet with 89 work stations — discovering the innovations of a handful of start-ups from the program. The business magnate was flanked by Rogers and his son Frédéric, head of connected technologies at Tag Heuer, as well as Station F founder Xavier Niel and his life partner, Arnault’s daughter Delphine, who is executive vice president at Louis Vuitton — the group’s largest brand — and a member of the LVMH board.

In an upbeat mood, Arnault personally tested Memomi’s Memory Mirror, a digital mirror platform harnessing a combination of artificial intelligence with virtual and augmented reality to allow customers in real time to virtually try on products such as clothing, eyewear, footwear, accessories and makeup. He sampled a range of augmented wood materials by Woodoo and checked out a new generation couture mannequin robot by Euveka, but politely declined a bespoke cocktail proposed by connected mixologist Kuantom.

“For me, this place is so great, I’m starting to wonder if we shouldn’t move the LVMH headquarters here, things would certainly run more smoothly, and it would be less expensive. That could be an idea for a start-up,” quipped Arnault during his speech at the event, reminding the audience of the start-up roots of his group.

“We have a historic proximity to the start-up world. A lot of our brands started from scratch, going back to Christian Dior in 1947. The first thing he did was ask his first assistant of the time, Pierre Cardin, to go and buy a sewing machine,” said Arnault. “We have continued to innovate each year, most recently with the launch last September of a beauty start-up by a certain well-known singer called Rihanna. From zero, we went on to generate several hundreds of millions in the first year and are expecting to reach almost 500 million euros in revenues this year.

“The thing these firms [on our program] have in common is that they have an innovative idea and want to develop it. The second, which is very important for us, is that they have the entrepreneurial spirit needed to get things done as efficiently as possible no matter how many countries you are present in. We find this spark in the companies present here and that’s why we want to stay close to them,” he added.

Arnault told journalists a fusion with a tech company was not on the cards. “We are users of technology but we are not a tech group, it’s a different métier,” he said. “You cannot mix fire and water.”

Media-shy Niel took the opportunity to point out a specificity of Station F. “Forty percent of the start-ups here were created by women, and it’s a place that is directed by women,” he said, handing over the microphone to the site’s communications director Rachel Vanier.

Set to welcome 50 international start-ups yearly, in two six-month terms, the LVMH program, which had its soft launch in November, is geared at accelerating collaboration between start-ups proposing solutions and services for the luxury market and LVMH’s portfolio of 70 brands. All of the start-ups selected are already in discussion with, or developing projects with, one or more of the group’s brands, according to a statement.

Over half of them were identified through the LVMH Innovation Award introduced last year in partnership with the annual Viva Technology fair, set to celebrate its third edition this year. Areas span artificial intelligence; augmented and virtual reality; retail and e-commerce; blockchain and anticounterfeiting, and raw materials and sustainability.

Trend anticipator Heuritech — winner of the inaugural innovation award in 2017 — figures among the program’s first batch of start-ups. Others include VisioPM, specializing in digital signage solutions; Aryballe Technologies, which develops and sells portable, connected noses, billed as the Shazam of odors; SmartPixels, which creates “digital skins” for product displays and is already working with brands including Guerlain and Berluti, and Cypheme, an artificial intelligence capable of detecting a counterfeit product by analyzing the microstructure of the packaging using only a picture from a smartphone.

LVMH employees who have won awards on the group’s DARE LVMH intrapreneurship program, introduced last July, will also be invited to the space to develop their projects. One is said to involve the creation of a new LVMH brand.

Station F is billed as the largest start-up campus in the world, measuring 58 meters in width and 310 meters long — the equivalent of the Eiffel Tower lying down. Based in a reconverted freight station in Paris’ 13th arrondissement, it was designed by French engineer Eugène Freyssinet in the Twenties, with architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte behind its new incarnation.

The venue boasts eight event spaces, a 360-person auditorium called the Master Stage, 24 themed lounges, more than 60 meeting rooms located in raised glass-fronted shipping containers and a coworking coffee shop, dubbed Anticafé.

Among other actors moving in on the space, L’Oréal in October inked a strategic partnership with Station F to support the development of early stage digital beauty start-ups around the globe.

The driving motive for La Maison des Startups, explained LVMH’s Rogers during an interview in the run-up to its launch, was to “funnel” the torrent of start-ups in the group’s space and nurture relationships with the most relevant crop throughout the year in a dedicated space.

LVMH will provide workshops, networking sessions and seminars, with personalized coaching and support from in-house experts.

The second edition of the group’s innovation award has attracted applications from more than 800 start-ups, almost 60 percent more than last year, Rogers said. Around 30 finalists selected by a group of journalists and venture capitalists will present in the group’s Luxury Lab booth at Viva Technology in May, with a new winner to be selected.

“One of things we’ve discovered is that LVMH is so vast there are challenges of scale,” explained Rogers. “There are so many start-ups in our space, they call the brands directly, and the brands are looking for solutions.”

He said some firms contact him, others reach out to Alexandre Arnault, son of Arnault and co-ceo of German luggage maker Rimowa, while others call on Groupe Arnault, the investment firm controlled by the Arnault family. “There’s no way to get your arms around it,” Rogers said.

“Alexandre Arnault was the one who said, ‘Hey, let’s do something big that gives us a rhythm. Let’s create a moment where we build a relationship with the ones that matter,’” he added. “Instead of it being totally ad-hoc, there’s a process. What I’ve learned is, if you don’t formalize it, you don’t stand a chance. It’s death by a thousand cuts. It gives us a place and a way to prioritize.”

The idea is also to encourage interactions with the group’s “maisons.”

“We hosted Claude Martinez, president and chief executive officer of Parfums Christian Dior, and he spent three hours with the start-ups. Laurent Boillot [Guerlain’s president and ceo] is down there a lot as Guerlain has a team working out of there,” said Rogers, adding that the meetings are set up in a spontaneous manner so as not to create too much distraction for the start-ups.

“I’ll speak for myself and Alexandre Arnault: I’ve done a number of start-ups myself, and he’s in the start-up community — it’s not a corporate zoo. I don’t want it to be like, ‘Come look at the start-ups, these foreign creatures.’ [What we look at is], what are some legitimate ways that we can help their businesses, that we can learn from them, get inspiration,” he said.

Rogers described Station F as being like a little city, saying of its scale, “I’ve never personally participated in anything like it.”

“We wanted it to be a beautiful, comfortable place to work but not extravagant,” he said of the LVMH space.

“When you’re a start-up, you don’t need to leave Station F, you can do everything there; you can eat, interact with the French government, make use of the post office — it’s just amazing,” continued the executive, who, prior to being tapped by Arnault, worked on the launch of seven start-ups in the music business — including Mediacode, which was purchased by Yahoo — and headed up the launch of Apple Music.

Groupe Arnault, Aglaé Ventures, the early stage investment program of Groupe Arnault, and LVMH Luxury Ventures, a new investment entity for emerging brands launched last year, are open to investing in the start-ups, but “It’s mostly about having this focal point,” he said.

“What is certainly true is that Groupe Arnault is aware of every start-up, it’s on their radar…You just want to have that relationship,” added Rogers. Asked if there are other similar initiatives in the pipeline, he replied: “Right now, we’re open. And I think that’s very much the start-up way.”"
How Does LVMH Create Luxury Power Players? Rimowa Provides Some Clues - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2hvdy1kb2VzLWx2bWgtcmVwb3NpdGlvbi1hLWJyYW5kLWhhdmUtYS1sb29rLWEtcmltb3dhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"image: Rimowa x Off-White

How does LVMH turn a brand into a luxury power player? We need not to look much further than Rimowa for a glimpse. After acquiring an 80 percent stake in Cologne-based Rimowa in October 2016, 25-year old Alexandre Arnault was appointed to the co-CEO role alongside Dieter Morszeck, the grandson of Paul Morszeck, the founder of Rimowa. Together, the two have been enacting widespread change for the premium luggage label, from restructuring its distribution network and reworking the layouts of its stores to expanding the breadth of its collaborations and refining the nature of its branding.

Arnault, the third child of LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault, has been a loyal fan of Rimowa since his late teens. He is said to have been the guiding force behind the 2016 acquisition, one that Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli told Bloomberg at the time, is firmly in line with LVMH’s modus operandi of “looking for brands that have heritage and a unique position.” The Paris-based conglomerate – which owns 70 brands ranging from Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior to Hublot and Dom Pérignon – “knows that when they acquire these brands they can accelerate their development,” per Bernstein.

One of the first efforts in the grand plan to build up Rimowa – whose suitcases will set you back as much as $1,300 – came in early 2017 when the brand opened its Parisian flagship store. Speaking later in the year, ahead of Rimowa’s buzzy pop-up shop on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills (its first-ever pop-up), Arnault told Fashionista, “If you look at our former [retail] concepts, they were very white and very old-fashioned and we want to modernize our stores and make them more — it’s going to sound like every other brand — but more experiential.”

The revamp of Rimowa’s brick-and-mortar outposts and a slew of new store openings in Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, is part of what the company calls “a broad strategy initiative,” one that includes a healthy dose of modernization.

Rimowa already boasts a loyal fan base thanks its meticulously designed and crafted, and inherently practical travel pieces. But in a rapidly changing market, one that includes many younger travelers – thanks to “traveling becoming a lot less expensive,” per Arnault and an influx of millennial-focused luggage brands (Away, which just launched its own aluminum collection, comes to mind) – the 120-year old company has set out to inject some youth into its model, while still respecting its luxury foundation, of course.

In addition to changes in its stores, including adding “unique lifestyle product [offerings] that are made by local talents especially for the brand,” Rimowa-branded products, themselves, are getting the collaboration treatment, one of the more sure-fire ways to resonate with easily-bored millennials.

For instance, to coincide with the 80-year anniversary of the launch of its aluminium suitcase, Arnault enlisted the help of Nigo, Carine Roitfeld, David Fincher, Fan Bingbing, Virgil Abloh, and Karl Lagerfeld, among others, to personalize Rimowa suitcases. And shortly thereafter, Rimowa teamed up with fellow LVMH-owned brand, Fendi, for an exclusive collaboration. The “a modern yet elegant” luggage was front and center on the runway for Fendi’s Fall/Winter 2018 menswear show in January and shortly thereafter, imagery of the collab flooded Instagram, vying for the attention of fashion-forward travelers.

But even that was small change compared to the buzziest collaboration yet, which comes from Off-White, the streetwear brand created by newly-appointed Louis Vuitton menswear director, Virgil Abloh.

The brand’s social media presence has, of course, been subjected to a much more modern, high fashion-oriented aesthetic, whether it be in the form of videos featuring buzzy fashion publication 032c; a “Personal Journeys series” featuring young LA-based creatives Martine Syms, Lera Pen, and Jacob Bixenman; or polaroid-style imagery featuring some of fashion’s “it” influencers, such as Bella Hadid and Virgil Abloh.

As Hedi Slimane, who is now back under the LVMH umbrella as the creative director of Celine, demonstrated during his tenure at Saint Laurent, nary is a brand revamp complete without a change in branding. In furtherance of its attempt to best outfit Rimowa for the 21st century, its visual identity has gotten a makeover.

Since the LVMH takeover, Rimowa – led by Arnault and Hector Muelas, Chief Brand Officer of RIMOWA and in collaboration with German design studio Bureau Borsche and London-based design agency Commission Studio – developed a new “logo, monogram, visual language, and packaging.” The new look comes “in conjunction with celebrations around its upcoming 120th anniversary,” and aims to “project an image as distinctive and contemporary as its suitcases.”

Specifically, in place of the pill-shaped frame and rounded letters of Rimowa’s former logo is a new, more understated design. Additionally, the new branding does away with the blue hue and replaces it with shades of black, white and gray, all of which “encapsulates the timeless and considered nature of the brand,” per Muelas.



Still yet, Rimowa, under the watch of Arnault and Morszeck, is tightening its supply chain considerably. In what appears to be an extensive attempt to situate the brand further up the ladder in terms of exclusivity, Rimowa has confirmed that all existing contracts with its European trading partners have been terminated. Until very recently, the brand’s offerings could be found in a rather extensive number of third-party stockists across the globe, from high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Harrods in London to lesser known travel-specific retailers.

As set forth this week by Retail Detail and confirmed by a number of German news outlets, “The luxury suitcase brand made the decision [to formally cut ties with its suppliers] after LVMH decided to restructure Rimowa’s sales.” The goal is reportedly for Rimowa “to end up with fewer dealers,” with which it “will work more closely” and for which it will maintain “higher standards.”

Putting aside the modernization of its brand-owned and operated stores, its updated branding, and its new-found penchant for buzzy collaborations, Rimowa’s latest endeavor – its effort to limit the scope of its accessibility – arguably rings most true to the standards, and efforts, of LVMH. Its brands are not some of the most sought after in the world because they are available everywhere, after all."
"LVMH Launches an Accelerator Initiative to Discover, Foster Industry Start-Ups - The Fashion Law","Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtbGF1bmNoZXMtYW4tYWNjZWxlcmF0b3ItaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS10by1kaXNjb3Zlci1mb3N0ZXItaW5kdXN0cnktc3RhcnQtdXBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is looking beyond its arsenal of luxury stalwarts, like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, to start-ups and more niche brands as a means of getting a more secure hold on all aspects of the luxury market. To date, this has seen the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate partner with “premium sneaker + streetwear marketplace” seller Stadium Goods, enabling LVMH to tap into the hype of such resellers, while helping the New York-based business to fund future expansion.

The Stadium Goods deal is the first investment for the conglomerate’s LVMH Luxury Ventures, a subsidiary for the purpose of investing in emerging-stage fashion, cosmetics or accessories companies, that it launched in February 2017. The LVMH Luxury Ventures – which is headed by group deputy-head of mergers and acquisitions Julie Bercovy – will enable LVMH to buy stakes in luxury companies with sales of between 2 million and 5 million euros ($5.4 million) and that show high-growth potential.

In furtherance of its efforts to tap up-and-coming companies, LVMH, which holds the title of the world’s largest luxury goods group, announced the launch of La Maison des Startups, an accelerator initiative, which will be housed in Station F, a “startup megacampus” located in Paris. (As noted by Reuters, Station F was launched last year by French billionaire Xavier Niel, who is the significant other of Delphine Arnault, an executive at Louis Vuitton and daughter of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault).

According to WWD, “Set to host 50 international start-ups yearly in two six-month terms, the program is geared at accelerating collaboration between a curated range of start-ups proposing solutions and services for the luxury market and LVMH’s portfolio of 70 brands. All of the start-ups are already in discussion with, or developing projects with, one or more of the group’s brands.”

The trade publication further notes that over half of the start-up entities that are slated to take part in LVMH’s new program “were identified through the LVMH Innovation Award introduced last year.” The start-ups are expected to extend beyond fashion brands to those innovating in the areas of “artificial intelligence; augmented and virtual reality; e-commerce; blockchain and anti-counterfeiting, and raw materials and sustainability.”

As for who had a strong hand in spearheading the program, it turns out to be 25-year old Alexandre Arnault, the co-CEO of Rimowa, who, per LVMH’s chief digital officer Ian Rogers, was the one who said, “Hey, let’s do something big that gives us a rhythm. Let’s create a moment where we build a relationship with the ones that matter.”

In addition to “workshops, networking sessions and seminars, with personalized coaching and support from in-house experts,” there will also be potential for investment on the table. Groupe Arnault and LVMH Luxury Ventures are open to investing in the start-ups, said Rogers, who, along with Alexandre Arnault, is also involved with Miroslava Duma’s similarly-focused Future Tech Lab. Although, he says there are no immediate plans to support the firms financially."
LVMH's Eyewear Venture Looks to Triple Production - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbHZtaHMtZXlld2Vhci12ZW50dXJlLWxvb2tzLXRvLXRyaXBsZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONGARONE, Italy — A joint venture between Dior-owner LVMH and Italy's Marcolin could triple its production of glasses over time as its portfolio of brands expands.

LVMH last year followed in the steps of rival Kering which decided in 2014 to bring its eyewear business in house to increase control and pocket profit margins previously left to licensees.

The shift in strategy has dealt a blow to Italy's Safilo — the world's second-largest eyewear manufacturer behind domestic rival Luxottica.

Safilo lost LVMH's Celine brand to the new joint venture in December and is seen at risk of losing Christian Dior and other prestigious brands owned by the French luxury goods group after 2020.

The Thelios joint-venture, 51 percent owned by LVMH, could potentially boost production to 4.5 million pieces a year from 1.5 million currently, CEO Giovanni Zoppas said.

LVMH Managing Director Toni Belloni said the group's brands had freedom in their licensing choices but added Thelios would become what he termed a privileged partner.

""Some of the most important licences are due to expire in 2020 and in the following two years, which is a timeframe consistent with Thelios' learning curve,"" Belloni said.

Safilo's Dior licence expires in December 2020, Givenchy in 2021, Fendi in 2022 and Marc Jacobs in 2024.

The joint-venture inaugurated on Tuesday an 8,000 square metre plant in Italy's north east, an area famous for eyewear manufacturing. Thelios could more than double the plant's size if needed, Zoppas said.

In addition to Celine, the Thelios' portfolio includes at present Loewe and Fred.

""If we remained with three brands we would very disappointed ... we're determined to add more,"" Belloni said.

The executive said LVMH had no plans to raise further its 10 percent stake in Marcolin.

"LVMH, Marcolin Unveil Plans for Eyewear Joint Venture Thélios - WWD","Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbWFyY29saW4tdW52ZWlsLXBsYW5zLWZvci1leWV3ZWFyLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtdGhlbGlvcy0xMjAyNjU5ODA0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONGARONE, Italy — LVMH has “the ambition to do formidable things.” And to do so in a very strategic category such as eyewear, the group is banking on Thélios, the joint venture inked last year with Marcolin, according to Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

On Tuesday, Belloni and Giovanni Zoppas, chairman and chief executive officer of Thélios, unveiled the state-of-the art production plant here, a one-hour drive from Venice, and known as Italy’s storied eyewear hub. Manifattura Thélios is already producing eyewear collections for Céline, previously licensed to rival manufacturer Safilo; Loewe, which will debut in the second half of the year, and Fred, to bow by the end of the year.

Belloni identified Marcolin as “a consolidated and winning, experienced partner, and the ambition is to build a system of innovation and excellence, craftsmanship and technology and to reach global excellence, although we are aware we are only taking the first steps now.”

Asked about the choice to opt for a joint venture vis-à-vis internalizing production, as did Kering with the creation of Kering Eyewear in 2014, the executive said, “We thought it was best to lean not only on the district of excellence but on a company with a long experience to compete efficaciously. The fact that [Marcolin] will continue to be on the market is a guarantee that the ecosystem will always be open to innovation. Thélios will have to deserve the brands that could potentially be added [to the portfolio].”

Confessing he somewhat “envied pure players” focused on one category, Belloni remarked on how different categories work at different speeds in “this moment of big changes.” Thélios will allow to share knowledge, leverage synergies and “offer a wealth of opportunities such as technology that is derived from other processes in other categories of the group.”

Zoppas echoed Belloni’s forward-looking vision, “working on understanding what the market wants. Our ambition is to have a unique role in the eyewear market.”

He noted that current production of 1.5 million pieces could potentially reach 4.5 million pieces.

“Italy is the second country for our group and with France we share a patrimony of art and culture, and six Italian brands that are expressions of this culture are part of our group: Acqua di Parma; Cova; Bulgari; Fendi; Loro Piana; Pucci and, partly, Berluti,” said Belloni. “It’s an incredible patrimony and beyond the brands and the products, it’s about that inimitable Italian hand. Product is the fundamental pillar of our group. We have 23 production sites in Italy, up from five only five years ago, and we have invested 600 million euros in the past five years to strengthen production in Italy.”

Belloni mentioned the new Bulgari facility in Valenza, the Louis Vuitton footwear factory in Fiesso d’Artico and the plant in Berluti in Ferrara, which opened three years ago and “is already almost not enough [to sustain production].” LVMH is building a leather goods atelier in Tuscany’s Chianti for Céline, said Belloni, and one in Florence for Fendi. “Thélios becomes part of this stream of innovation and excellence,” he observed.

Overlooking the stunning Dolomites mountains, Thélios Manifattura was designed by Design Group Architetti Associati architects. The facade stands out, with its rust-colored panels in Cor-ten steel and large glass windows. The building is also considered durable and environmentally responsible, featuring over 2,300 solar panels installed on the roof. The site generates 10 percent of its annual energy needs, features LED lights and all its industrial waste is processed and not thrown back into the environment. The company employs 250 people, of which 100 are in the plant, and the majority are below age 30.

The factory was set up in record time in less than a year on land that covers 248,400 square feet. The plant spans over 86,400 square feet, of which 25,920 square feet are for offices and the rest is production. Thélios has reduced timing of production to 16 weeks from 20 weeks. Belloni did not provide details about the investment and noted there is a potential to expand by another 108,000 square feet. The company has reduced lead time in production by 30 percent, and it takes from six to nine months to go from design to market. “We blend know-how with technology,” noted Zoppas.

LVMH controls 51 percent of the joint venture, with the rest held by Marcolin, which, separately from Thélios, produces and distributes eyewear for Tom Ford, Ermenegildo Zegna, Tod’s and Diesel, among other brands. The French group has taken a 10 percent stake in Marcolin. Belloni said there were no plans to change LVMH’s shareholding.

Jean Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer of LVMH, said “there are not that many licenses that are as important as those of eyewear, which is a complicated category. LVMH did not want to risk doing [poorly in the category]. This is a long-term project and we believe we can work together well, but we don’t want to go too fast.”

Belloni said LVMH will allow each brand to choose its strategies and “will not force them but will encourage a dialogue with Thélios, which will be the preferred partner. But we must deserve the confidence. Let’s say that if [Thélios will total] only three brands, we would be very disappointed.”

Regarding Louis Vuitton, Belloni said the brand does not work with licenses, “so Thélios will propose a specific model for Vuitton.”

“This is one of the oldest sectors and our ambition is to bring through Thélios a different way to propose content, product and merchandising,” said Zoppas. Distribution is what makes the difference, he contended, and can even damage a brand.

Asked whether Thélios was considering its own stores, Belloni conceded retail is one of LVMH’s “obsessions.” Taking things one step at a time, “if there is a form of integration to optimize our presence, with attention to travel retail, we would consider it, but the distribution strategy is brand by brand and must be absolutely integrated with the label. The goal is not the same for each brand, Céline is different from Fred in the number and quality of doors.” Execution must be tailor-made on each label, he observed.

Zoppas touted the advantages of having all steps of design, production and industrialization under the same roof, with employees working together and “understanding a problem before it presents itself. What is wrong is irreversible in eyewear. LVMH is leaning on someone who knows the industry and the system, someone who has already learned from its mistakes,” he said, sharing a laugh with Belloni.

Belloni addressed the issues related to the gray market, noting that he expected Thélios to focus on this as an “area of intervention” and careful control of distribution.

Speaking about potential business opportunities, Zoppas views omnichannel, also in the sense of digital communication, as a strong vehicle for growth in all markets. Belloni agreed, saying customers are informed and interact. “We must be there to be as accessible as much as possible and provide good service. Eyewear is easily shared, and has a strong potential in communication,” he said. A Thélios web site is “not an immediate plan,” he said.

Zoppas, underscoring the respect for the cultural heritage of the region, said Thélios brings “new initiatives to the district. This is not about stealing employees from other companies, but about training new people — we are investing in young people.”

Thélios is the synthesis of the names of the Greek gods Theia, of light and sight, and Helios, god of the sun.

Marcolin was founded by Giovanni Marcolin Coffen in 1961 in Longarone. PAI Partners took control of the company in 2012."
LVMH's Silicon-Valley-style startup incubator will foster innovation in luxury - Quartz,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL3F1YXJ0enkvMTI0ODgwMC9sdm1ocy1zdGFydHVwLWluY3ViYXRvci1hdC1zdGF0aW9uLWYtd2lsbC1mb3N0ZXItaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1pbi1sdXh1cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, has unveiled a startup incubator, like the ones that have nurtured countless young companies in Silicon Valley—only this one is based in Paris, and its focus is specifically on technology for the luxury world.

The program will support 50 international companies each year, LVMH said in its official announcement, and will host them at Station F, the enormous Paris facility supported by French president Emmanuel Macron and billed as the world’s largest startup campus. The startups will get to familiarize themselves with challenges facing the luxury industry through a series of workshops, and will do regular pitch sessions on their solutions to representatives of LVMH’s various brands.

The companies’ ideas are in a variety of areas, including artificial intelligence, blockchain and anti-counterfeiting technology, augmented reality, personalization, internet of things, e-commerce, and sustainability. LVMH published a document (pdf) with brief profiles of the innovators it selected for its inaugural program.

One company, Heuritech, has visual-recognition technology that can analyze millions of social media images every day to anticipate trends.

Orbis specializes in “hologram communication solutions to energise events and retail networks.”

VisioPM says it creates and broadcasts 3D animations on screens that are visible without 3D glasses and that viewers can manipulate with hand movements.

Aryballe Technologies creates portable odor sensors, devices “billed as the Shazam of odors,” according to WWD, which toured the accelerator (paywall).

LVMH—whose brands run the gamut from Dior and Louis Vuitton in its fashion division, to Acqua di Parma and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in its perfumes and cosmetics group—looks to be positioning itself for an increasingly techy future in fashion.

The luxury landscape is changing shape as shopping moves online, technology changes how physical stores look, and science opens up new avenues for materials. Millennials and younger generations, who care little for a brand’s heritage (pdf), make up a growing share of luxury buyers, and LVMH can no longer rely on its famous names to keep their attention.

Ian Rogers, who LVMH poached from Apple in 2015 to lead its digital operations, told Reuters that “the idea is to animate and activate those conversations around the things that might affect the luxury industry.”

The incubator program actually launched in November, and nearly all of the startups are already working with at least one of LVMH’s labels."
PETA Says it Will Take on LVMH Over Use of Animal Skins for Pricey Accessories - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3BldGEtc2F5cy1pdC13aWxsLXRha2Utb24tbHZtaC1vdmVyLXVzZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtc2tpbnMtZm9yLXByaWNleS1hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Early last year, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced that it had acquired a single share in French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and now, it will attempt to make good on the rights that come along with it. After allegedly being refused entrance to an April 2017 LVMH shareholder meeting on the heels of announcing that it would challenge the use by the conglomerate’s fashion brands of crocodile skins for their accessories, PETA is undeterred.

The well-known animal rights group has confirmed that it will try again to confront Louis Vuitton executives at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s annual meeting in Paris on Thursday, which is well within its rights, according to the group, as a shareholder in LVMH, the French luxury group that owns fashion brands, including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, and Fendi, among others.

On the heels of exposing an array of grave animal abuses at the group’s Vietnam crocodile farms — including two that have supplied skins to a tannery owned by LVMH — PETA upped the ante by acquiring a small stake in LVMH in 2017 in order to have access to its annual meetings, in much the same way it acquired stakes in Prada and Hermes in recent years.

“LVMH knows full well the extreme cruelty behind its bags, watchbands, and shoes,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said on Wednesday. “This company has blood on its hands, and PETA will continue to demand that it stop selling the stolen skin of animals who endured extreme confinement and agonizing deaths.”

As PETA confirmed to TFL this time last year, one of its representatives was barred from LVMH’s 2017 annual meeting, after announcing to the press that it planned to challenge the group’s use of animal skins, including alligator and crocodile hides in its pricey products. An LVMH spokesman did not comment at the time.

Per PETA’s statement last April, “Upon arriving at LVMH’s annual meeting, PETA’s representative was refused entrance to the main meeting room and denied the opportunity to ask board members a question about the company’s appalling use of exotic-animal skins. Companies will go to great lengths to avoid confrontation about the suffering that animals endure at their hands. Although PETA is disappointed by LVMH’s rebuff, we remain steadfast in our efforts to advocate for change.”

While old-school picketing and red paint – two of PETA’s most notorious protest tactics – may still work in some cases, it is 2018, and PETA has obviously seen a need to incorporate new tactics into the mix, including good old fashioned ownership stakes, even if it is not having much luck in the LVMH board room … yet."
"LVMH's Watch, Jewelry Sales Rise 20 Percent in First Quarter - JCK","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1zYWxlcy1yaXNlLWZpcnN0LXF1YXJ0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s stable of watch and jewelry brands enjoyed an astounding 20 percent organic revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018, the luxury conglomerate announced recently.

That’s better than all of the luxury conglomerate’s other business groups, and it also tops the 13 percent organic growth the overall company registered for the first quarter of the year.

LVMH’s “organic growth” metric is calculated using comparable exchange rates. When looking at reported growth, the watch and jewelry business group only showed 9 percent growth over the prior year, a lower but still impressive number.

In a press release, the Paris-based company singled out the following initiatives by its stable of watch and jewelry brands:

– “Bulgari enjoyed an excellent performance and continues to gain market share thanks to the strength of its iconic lines Serpenti, B.Zero1, Diva, and Octo.”

– “Chaumet unveiled its new high-end jewelry collection.”

– “The innovative products presented by LVMH’s watch brands at the Baselworld Watch and Jewelry Fair were very well received, including Hublot’s Big Bang Sapphire Tourbillon, Bulgari’s Octo Finissimo Automatic Tourbillon, and new models in the iconic Monaco and Carrera lines at TAG Heuer and Defy at Zenith.”

LVMH’s watches and jewelry division comprises Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Chaumet, Dior Watches, Zenith, Fred, and Hublot.

Overall, LVMH dubbed the business environment in the first quarter of the year “buoyant,” although it continued to be “marked by unfavorable exchange rates and geopolitical uncertainties.”

“LVMH will continue to focus its efforts on developing its brands, maintaining strict control over costs, and targeting its investments on the quality, excellence, and innovation of its products and their distribution,” a statement said. “The Group will rely on the talent and motivation of its teams, the diversification of its businesses, and the geographical balance of its revenue to reinforce, once again in 2018, its global leadership position in luxury goods.”

PARIS (Reuters) - France's LVMH <LVMH.PA> is fostering projects by entrepreneurs in the luxury goods sector, including a startup working with silkworms on new materials and another whose software might help detect counterfeits.

The Louis Vuitton owner on Monday unveiled a Paris-based startup programme, which aims to support some 50 businesses a year by hosting them in a mega-campus where they can collaborate with its brands.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, is following in the footsteps of French cosmetics giant L'Oreal <OREP.PA> in grabbing a corner of Station F, a vast startup incubator in Paris where it offers rent-free space to the startups.

""The idea is to animate and activate those conversations around the things that might affect the luxury industry,"" said Ian Rogers, a former Apple music executive who joined LVMH in 2015 as chief digital officer.

Paris is among major European cities bidding to displace London's dominance in the startup scene as Britain's EU exit looms and President Emmanuel Macron pushes a pro-reform agenda designed to promote budding businesses and draw investment.

LVMH was for now concentrating its startup efforts on the French capital, Rogers added. ""It's our home, and it's in a unique moment right now,"" he said.

Station F was launched last year by French billionaire Xavier Niel, who is also the partner of Delphine Arnault, an executive at Vuitton and daughter of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault.

Luxury and beauty firms are increasingly interested in tech projects, as they do more business online and use apps that allow customers to try out products, and many are investing in new fabrics or connected objects too.

LVMH, which also owns fashion label Christian Dior and champagne house Moet & Chandon, did not disclose how much it was spending on Its Station F venture, which kicked off in November but was formally unveiled on Monday.

Story continues

Rogers did not rule out that LVMH or its venture capital arm could invest in some of the startups later on, though said there were no immediate plans to support the firms financially.

LVMH on Monday posted a better-than-expected rise in first quarter sales, boosted by strong demand from Chinese consumers. [L8N1RM4ZJ]

Many of the startups have already had some contact with LVMH or other luxury brands but want to grow their reach.

Clara Hardy, co-founder of Sericyne, which has patented a new technique allowing silkworms to spin shapes onto moulds, said the firm had designed decorative watch faces using the material, for instance, and had more projects in the works.

""Our business still has a lot of commercial development to do,"" said Hardy, 28.

Dominique Muret Published

Apr 25, 2018

At the end of 2016, announced its intention to make a serious investment in the eyewear segment through a partnership with Italian group Marcolin. As a result, the companies created the joint venture , 51% of which is owned by LVMH and 49% by Marcolin. Sixteen months later, the project has taken physical form, following the inauguration on Tuesday of an ultra-modern factory in Longarone, in Northern Italy's eyewear district, Belluno, where Marcolin has its HQ.

LVMH Group Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer Jean-Baptiste Voisin were on site for the occasion. ""Italy is the second home of LVMH. We have 9,500 associates here – a figure which has doubled in the last five years – as well as 23 production sites, compared to five only a short time ago. In the last five years we have invested 600 million euros in the peninsula,"" stated Toni Belloni during a press conference.



LVMH has no fewer than seven Italian houses in its portfolio – , , , Loro Piana, , footwear manufacturer Rossimoda and Cova cafés –, and a number of the group's 70 brands also operate factories on the peninsula.

""We have developed substantial infrastructure in the country. Thélios is part of this estate"", continued Belloni, who refrained, however, from giving further details about the total sum of the investment. When the project was first announced, Marcolin evoked an initial injection of some 50 million euros which would be made over ""four to five years"" and be split equally between the partners.



""When we acquired this 23,000-square-meter plot in April 2017, there was nothing here. Today, there's an 8,000-square-meter building, 5,600 square meters of which are set aside for production, with the rest used for offices. We also have an extra 10,000 square meters at our disposition. Currently, Thélios employs 250 people with an average age of under thirty, a headcount which should double before 2018. The facility's full production capacity is 1.5 million pairs of glasses a year, a figure which could rise to 4 million should the site expand"", said Thélios CEO .

Thanks to state-of-the-art tools and machines, the factory, a corten steel and glass structure designed by Designgroup Architetti, will reduce the production time of a pair of glasses by 30%. The companies' objective is to reduce the entire process, from production to delivery, from 20 weeks to 16.



The joint venture's operations began in December with the production of 's line of glasses. ""They're already on the market! To achieve this, on this occasion, we had to rely on Marcolin's sites, where our craftsmen were trained"", explained Giovanni Zoppas. Looking forward, the first eyewear collection should launch before the second quarter and jewelry brand Fred's line – previously produced by – is set to be released before the end of the year.



""Obviously, we'd like to expand beyond these three brands. But before we do, we need to fine tine our machine, particularly the communication with our brands, who are free to make their choice. We won't force them to come to Thélios to produce their glasses. We prefer to start small, developing our excellence in order to make our factory more attractive"", said LMVH's managing director.



The luxury giant's eyewear operations are currently very diversified. A number of collections are manufactured through licenses with a variety of different partners, including , which produces Bulgari's glasses, for example, or , which holds the license for , recently renewed until 2020, as well as for Fendi. As for , the brand manages its own eyewear collections internally through suppliers.

With Thélios, which takes its name from Theia, Greek goddess of sight, and Helios, god of the sun, 's luxury group hopes to implement a new business model, similar to that adopted by rival , which internalized all of its eyewear operations through Kering Eyewear. The objective is to ""construct an ecosystem of innovation and excellence built around expert craftmanship, industry and new technology, while also guaranteeing the high-end distribution appropriate for the product"". In this spirit, an office has also been set up in Paris to help tighten the bonds between brands.



In Marcolin, which is owned by the French investment fund PAI Partners and holds licenses for brands such as , , , , Tod's, Dsquared2 and Swarovski, LVMH looks to have found a strong partner for its new venture.



""There are fewer and fewer operations carried out through licenses. Eyewear is one of them, because it's a very complex business. LVMH didn't want to take any risks in this segment, which is why we've partnered with an expert in the sector. We were also in talks with others, including Safilo. But we very much appreciated Marcolin's work, especially what they did for "", explained LVMH Chief Strategy Officer Jean-Baptiste Voisin.



""We intend to stay in this industry for a long time. At what speed we'll progress, honestly, I don't know. But it'll be our own – the speed at which we are able to acquire the necessary knowledge and brands. Eyewear is too complicated a sector and the stakes are too high for us to rush into it and do a bad job"", he concluded."

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Arnault - who is the CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH - is now the fourth richest person in the world and the richest in Europe with an estimated wealth of $70.7 billion (£50 billion). His financial boost comes as Christian Dior posted record sales last week. LVMH also oversees Louis Vuitton, Céline and Givenchy.

In 2017, the company reported record sales of 42.6 billion euros, a 13 percent rise on 2016. Rising demand in the Far East is thought to have helped LVMH, as well as the strength of the euro against the dollar and pound. It has also made big steps in the digital sphere, last year launching its multi-brand luxury shopping platform 24 Sevres, which was the first online destination to stock Céline - considered a big coup within the industry.

However, Arnault still has a way to go before he becomes the world's wealthiest man. In first position is Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who is worth $118 billion (about £83 billion), followed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates with $90.3 billion (£63 billion) and business magnate Warren Buffett in third with $84.1 billion (£59.6 billion)."

Its revenue grew by 10 per cent for the first quarter to reach €10.9 billion.

Organic growth was 13 per cent compared to the same period last year, with all business groups contributing to the result. Excluding the loss of the DFS Group airport business, the figure would have been 15 per cent.

There was 20 per cent organic revenue growth for the watches and jewellery business group, with Bulgari continuing to gain market share.

Organic revenue increased 17 per cent in perfumes and cosmetics, with strong growth momentum again for Parfums Christian Dior.

The fashion and leather goods business group had organic revenue growth of 16 per cent, with Louis Vuitton making a remarkable start to the year, says the company. Christian Dior Couture, which was consolidated into the group in July, turned in an excellent performance, while Fendi and Loro Piana grew rapidly in ready-to-wear and shoes.

For wines and spirits, organic revenue grew 10 per cent. Champagne volumes rose by 1 per cent. In a context of supply constraints, Hennessy cognac volumes grew by 5 per cent.

In selective retailing, organic revenue rose 9 per cent, or 16 per cent excluding the termination of the Hong Kong airport concession. Sephora continued to gain market share with its new store concept continuing its roll-out.

Online sales grew rapidly all over the world. DFS performed particularly well in T Galleria outlets in Hong Kong and Macau, while the new store in Cambodia performed strongly.

Despite unfavourable exchange rates and geopolitical uncertainties, the year started with a buoyant environment, says LVMH.

Rodeo Drive Keeps Its Retail Luster With Recent Deal - Apparel News,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGFyZWxuZXdzLm5ldC9uZXdzLzIwMTgvYXByLzEyL3JvZGVvLWRyaXZlLWtlZXBzLWl0cy1yZXRhaWwtbHVzdGVyLXJlY2VudC1kZWFsLz9wcmludNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Vacancy is common for most retail streets under attack from e-commerce competitors, but not Rodeo Drive. There is hardly a vacant space on the hoity-toity retail shopping district in Beverly Hills, Calif. When real-estate news is made on the street, it makes a splash.

That was seen when the French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. paid $110 million for a two-story white building at 456 N. Rodeo Drive, next to a Ralph Lauren flagship. That puts the price for the 6,200-square-foot building at $17,750 a square foot.

The Paris-headquartered entity is the parent company of some very high-end brands, including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Christian Dior, Céline, Fendi and Marc Jacobs. It already runs boutiques for six of its brands on the street, but the company hasn’t disclosed its plans for its recent acqusition, purchased on March 28.

The sale also made news because the previous owner, Sterling Organization of Palm Beach, Fla., bought it one day for $55 million and the next day flipped it for $110 million, according to a statement from the organization, which is not related to Los Angeles billionaire Donald Sterling.

After buying the property, Sterling approached LVMH about leasing the property. Instead, the company said it preferred to own it.

Jay Luchs, vice chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, who handled the deal, said the benefits of buying a building include knowing your rent won’t rise or that you will not lose your lease. “They are in full control. They are the landlord. They can control their own destiny,” Luchs said.

Keeping the Golden Triangle golden

While many may doubt the future of retail in general, Brian D. Kosoy, Sterling’s president and chief executive officer, said it was crucial for luxury brands to be on the affluent shopping street, which marks the center of Beverly Hills’ Golden Triangle. “In New York, luxury retailers have plenty of viable options where they can locate,” Kosoy said. “On the West Coast, it’s all about those three, high-value blocks of Rodeo Drive, where the world’s premier luxury brands must have a presence by planting their flag. As a result, when a circumstance presents itself to acquire a Rodeo Drive property, you aggressively pursue it, regardless of the complications involved in getting a deal done.”

Space does not come cheap on Rodeo Drive. A square foot of commercial space on the street rents for $50 to $70 per month. The second most expensive retail space in the Los Angeles area is on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Calif., where retail rents average $20 a month per square foot, Luchs said.

The LVMH acquisition may have made headlines, but it doesn’t compare to Chanel’s deal at the end of 2015 to buy the building it now occupies on the corner of Rodeo Drive and Brighton Way for $152 million.

In August 2016, LVMH paid $122 million for the House of Bijan building at 420 N. Rodeo Drive.

Finding a space on Rodeo is tough, said Kathy Gohari, president of the merchants group Rodeo Drive Committee and the general manager of the flagship for Valentino. “When flagship stores open on Rodeo, they don’t really leave,” she said. Stores may move to temporary quarters when the flagships are being remodeled.

Currently, there are a handful of spaces available on Rodeo Drive. The former Hugo Boss space, at 414 N. Rodeo Drive, is being split into two spaces. Also vacant is 449 N. Rodeo Drive, which formerly housed the Paul & The Shark menswear brand. The Zadig & Voltaire space at 465 Rodeo Drive is listed as available for sublease.

Rodeo Drive is a big attraction for tourists. Walk through the enclave and you’ll hear people speaking in languages from every corner of the world. But there has been criticism that tourists and locals merely window-shop on the street and make few purchases with the flagships serving as expensive billboards for major European fashion houses.

Retail analysts are divided on the business of flagships. Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst of The NPD Group, said luxe flagship stores don’t earn their keep with cash. “Flagships are not about making money but showcasing the brand. The money allocated to it often comes from the marketing budget, not the retail budget. Having a high-profile flagship at a prestigious location is one of the few ways brands can continue to showcase the essence of the brand and reinforce the full range of products not able to be displayed at retail partners,” he said.

Michael Brown, a global strategy and management consultant, said marketing is a significant function of flagship stores, but it isn’t the whole story.

“Retail location profitability is becoming increasingly more difficult to measure because purchases made online are often a result of a store visit. We call this the difference between ‘value creation’ [the visit] and ‘value capture’ [the sale transaction]. In a broad definition of profitability, the flagship’s contribution can be measured and they can be profitable,” he wrote in an email.

Selling expensive clothes can help the bottom line.

“Luxury retailers have the advantage of high price points, which facilitates profitability even when real estate comes at a high price,” added Brown, who is a partner at A.T. Kearney and the author of “The Future of Shopping Centers.”

Tyler Higgins, a director of global consultancy AArete, said it is crucial to have space on Rodeo Drive because of the people who shop there. “Companies may assign a value to the intangibles of being on Rodeo around other luxury brands, but they are still able to make money. Why can they be unwavering in their price point? For starters, their target shoppers are not ones who browse Amazon.com looking for rock-bottom pricing but rather ones who want the bespoke treatment that these stores provide.

“Being able to shop on Rodeo Drive drives an air of exclusivity that these brands are seeking. This exclusivity drives up the ability for them to charge $4,000, $10,000, $30,000 for bags, shoes and clothes. As long as tourists, along with other shoppers, continue to arrive, Rodeo Drive and the flagship stores will remain,” Higgins said."
China's Streetwear Fans Are Hyped About Rimowa x Supreme Collab - Jing Daily,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluYS1yaW1vd2Etc3VwcmVtZS1jb2xsYWLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Excitement about a new collaboration between luggage brand Rimowa and clothing brand Supreme offers yet more evidence of the cachet streetwear now has among China’s young luxury shoppers.

Marking the 120th anniversary of Rimowa, the LVMH-owned luxury brand unveiled a special edition of the Topas Multiwheel suitcases in collaboration with streetwear label Supreme on April 12. The deal was announced just three days ago, though the information was leaked and has been circulating online for a while. On launch, the collection will be available in four cities – New York, Los Angeles, London, and Paris, as well as Rimowa's official site . The price range is 1,600-1,800.

Though the suitcases aren't being sold in Chinese stores, there is plenty of buzz about the collaboration online. Mainstream fashion and streetwear media such as Yoho! have posted articles on the crossover explaining how Chinese consumers can successfully “grab” (抢) the items by taking advantage of the time difference.

An analysis of the seven-day and 90-day heat chart of the word “Rimowa”, enabled by WeChat Index, indicates that mentions of the brand on WeChat have skyrocketed since April 9, the day when the brand officially announced the collection.

Dealmoon , an e-commerce site aimed at Chinese consumers in the United States, also promoted the collaboration on Wednesday, generating a great number of user comments. Most expressed interest in purchasing the suitcases, with some joking that they would “forever be concerned about the safety of the suitcase” if they owned one.

Others asked for tips on how they can beat the crowd when ordering online, anticipating the items would be sold out in seconds. Many shoppers plan to line up in front of the store on April 12, but they will need to enter a lottery to win the opportunity to make a purchase in-store.

Cloris Lei, a 21-year-old Chinese student studying in New York, succeeded in ""grabbing"" the suitcase online. “It’s all about luck and the speed,"" she told Jing Daily. But she has no plan in keeping it forever, as the hype demand among Chinese consumers for the suitcase has pushed up the price dramatically.

""I plan to resell it at least for 20,000 RMB (3,178, which double the original price) maybe on Taobao or eBay,"" said Lei.

Chinese luxury consumers skew younger than those in other markets, and their numbers and purchasing power make them a real driving force behind luxury and streetwear crossovers. The latest study by Goldman Sachs shows that the number of Chinese millennials reached 415 million in 2017, accounting for nearly one-third of China's total population. Bain & Company predicted that this group of people will be the main driver of the global luxury goods market in coming years.

It's a fickle market however, and a difficult line for heritage luxury brands to walk. A collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Supreme in 2017 was not free from criticism in China."

by Vincent Lane

It’s official: At the age of 69, Louis Vuitton CEO Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault is now the richest man in fashion, on top of being the richest person in all of France.

In their register of the world’s richest people, Forbes Magazine listed Arnault at fourth place behind Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet ($84.1 billion), Microsoft’s Bill Gates ($90.3 billion), and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($118 billion). But with a considerable $86.3 billion to his name, there is nothing to complain about for Arnault, who oversees an empire of over 60 luxury brands in a variety of categories.

On the LVMH empire.

Louis Vuitton, or the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, is the product of a merger between Moët Hennessy – itself a product of a union of champagne producer Moët & Candon and cognac brand Hennessy since 1971 – and the Louis Vuitton fashion house. The merger, which was completed in 1987, was made possible through Arnault’s leadership and careful mediation. By 1989, his efforts paid off in the form of Executive Chairmanship and the title of Chief Executive Officer.

In the three decades since he took over, Arnault has transformed the small clothing manufacturer into an instantly recognizable global conglomerate that employs 120,000 people all over the world. The firm raked in over $51 billion in revenues in 2017 alone. Balancing ubiquity and exclusivity, the Louis Vuitton brand itself is a fashion powerhouse, appearing on runways and red carpets.

This year’s Oscars was dotted with LVMH couture, from Sandra Bullock’s mesmerizing custom silk Louis Vuitton gown to Jennifer Lawrence’s form-fitting metallic dress from Dior, an LVMH subsidiary. Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot also graced the red carpet in sparkling two-tone Givenchy, also under the LVMH group of brands. The Garnette Report readers might also remember Loving’s Ruth Negga, wearing a stunning bold and black number from Louis Vuitton.

Outside of fashion, the LVMH portfolio of luxury brands are divided into five main groups. These include Wines and Spirits (Mercier, Chandon, and Belvedere), Perfumes and Cosmetics (Make Up Forever, Dior, Benefit Cosmetics), Watches and Jewelry (Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Chaumet), Specialist Retailing (Sephora, Starboard Cruise Services, and Le Bon Marché). In Fashion and Leather Goods, other brands include Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Rimowa, and Céline.

The man behind the empire

One of the world’s most prestigious taste-makers, Arnault actually began as an engineer in his father’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel, in 1971. Under his counsel, the company liquidated its construction division to focus on real estate, and holiday accommodation, going under the name Férinel. From then on, he became the organization’s CEO in 1977 and president in 1979.

Arnault finally entered the world of fashion in 1984, when he acquired a luxury goods company called Financiére Agache and took control of textile company Boussac Saint-Fréres. At the time, the latter had owned Christian Dior as well as Le Bon Marché. By July 1988, Arnault spent an estimated $2.1 million to become the first shareholder of LVMH, setting off a chain of events that has led him to become fashion’s richest today.

Outside of fashion, Arnault is an art patron and collector. He has also invested in web companies, yachts, supermarkets, and even Netflix. He is also a recipient of numerous awards, including the Woodrow Wilson Award for Global Corporate Citizenship, and the Museum of Modern Art’s David Rockefeller Award."
LVMH shares hit record high as first-quarter sales jump on thriving luxury sector - ZAWYA,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLXNoYXJlcy1oaXQtcmVjb3JkLWhpZ2gtYXMtZmlyc3QtcXVhcnRlci1zYWxlcy1qdW1wLW9uLXRocml2aW5nLWx1eHVyeS1zZWN0b3ItamprbjUzbDfSAYIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemF3eWEuY29tL2VuL2J1c2luZXNzL2x2bWgtc2hhcmVzLWhpdC1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1hcy1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLXNhbGVzLWp1bXAtb24tdGhyaXZpbmctbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci1qamtuNTNsNz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS - Shares in France's LVMH rose over 5 percent to record highs in early trading on Tuesday after the Louis Vuitton owner posted better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter, helped by thriving Chinese appetite for luxury goods.

The upbeat start to the year for LVMH, the industry's biggest company and parent to brands like Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, sets an encouraging tone for peers at the start of their reporting season.

Luxury goods firms benefited from a strong rebound in Asian demand last year, a momentum that has shown little signs of fading.

""Despite the concerns about the toughening comparable basis in the luxury sector, we believe that LVMH's results confirm the ongoing strong underlying trends in the market,"" analysts at Berenberg said in a note.

Shares in Paris-based conglomerate Kering , owner of fashion label Gucci, also advanced by 3.8 percent while shares in Burberry climbed 1.7 percent.

LVMH shares never go out of fashion - Times of Malta,"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L2x2bWgtc2hhcmVzLW5ldmVyLWdvLW91dC1vZi1mYXNoaW9uLjY3NjU0MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE released Q1 2018 revenue results and once again impressed the market. Having gone through our model, we increased the price target from €290 to €305.



Main highlights from the Q118 revenue release:



• Good start to year with double-digit growth

• Despite strong negative currency impact partly offset by positive perimeter effect

• All business groups and regions contributed to organic revenue growth

• Good performance of Wines & Spirits

• Creative momentum at Louis Vuitton drove its strong performance

• Christian Dior Couture, integrated since July 2017, continued its good momentum from H2 2017.

• Other fashion brands performed well.

• Continued robust growth at Parfums Christian Dior, driven by all product categories.

• Sustained impressive increases at Bvlgari

• Sephora’s growth continued in key regions

• Strong increases at DFS in Hong Kong and Macao

Investment rationale below:



• We expect the group to continue generating an EBIT margin of 20%+ in the coming years. The current EBIT margin of the Group is 19.41%.

• Our price target is based on a forward P/E of 27x. We would not be surprised if this had to increase to 30x given the strong positive momentum we are seeing in the sector.

• LVMH 1Q was a strong quarter for the group with all business groups and regions contributed to organic revenue growth.

• Management remain optimistic about the future.

• Don’t forget this group outperformed even during the Asian crisis (end 2015/ beginning 2016) when retail was getting slaughtered due to concerns China was slowing down. LVMH was still managing to outperform consensus.

• All brands within the group are well known and doing exceptionally well.

• A large number of product launches ahead.

• Potential for price hikes at Louis Vuitton if the euro continues to strengthen against other currencies.

• Asia is the largest market for LVMH. This is seen as a positive as we expect growth from this region to remain strong in the years ahead.

• Other analysts are also increasing their price target on this stock given the strength of this company.

• Management is going through a cost cutting exercise which should improve margins going forward.

• LVMH is well positioned to benefit from improved economic conditions.

Concerns

• Geopolitical risks.

• Weakness in global growth.

• Continued strength in the Euro.

Conclusion

We believe LVMH is well positioned to benefit from future growth. We don’t expect the optimism being reported by the company on its performance to slow down anytime soon. The strong product mix, favourable environment, strong position in Asia as well as favourable tax rates from the US going forward make LVMH excellently positioned to continue to benefit from global growth.

We recommend that LVMH should form part of the core holdings in a well-diversified portfolio.
