How LVMH helped make Rihanna a billionaire - Quartz,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwNDMxNTYvaG93LWx2bWgtaGVscGVkLW1ha2UtcmloYW5uYS1hLWJpbGxpb25haXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna has joined the exclusive ranks of the world’s billionaires. The singer’s worth now stands at $1.7 billion, according to an estimate from Forbes. Despite her fame as a performer, it’s her makeup line, Fenty Beauty, that makes up the majority of that fortune—about $1.4 billion of it, to be exact.

Rihanna’s stardom undoubtedly helped to make the brand so valuable. Even more important was her insight in making cosmetics for a wide range of skin tones to address the needs of darker-skinned women, who had been historically underserved by the beauty industry.

But it certainly didn’t hurt that she had a powerful partner in her corner: LVMH, the luxury conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton, Dior, and many other successful brands.

Fenty Beauty—its name comes from Rihanna’s full name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty—launched in 2017 under the umbrella of LVMH’s beauty incubator, Kendo. The program creates products to be sold in Sephora, the popular cosmetics and perfume retailer also owned by—you guessed it—LVMH. The conglomerate invested €30 million (about $35 million) in cash in the venture, taking a 50.01% stake. Rihanna agreed to put in €30 million in “in-kind” contributions, meaning assets such as her time, effort, and name, and controls the remaining 49.99%. “We are aiming for the stars,” David Suliteanu, Kendo’s CEO at the time, told trade outlet WWD in 2016 (paywall).

Rihanna and LVMH: a powerful partnership

Fenty Beauty had not only had the technical expertise and financial backing of LVMH, which already had a portfolio of perfumes and cosmetics brands, but also a built-in distribution channel in Sephora. (The brand also sells online through the Fenty Beauty site.) With Rihanna’s savvy and promotion, it took off. In its first full year in operation, it generated a reported €500 million in sales.

While LVMH doesn’t break out the brand’s sales separately in its quarterly reports, it has consistently said the brand continues to grow. Last year, it also expanded into the lucrative skincare space. Forbes now estimates Fenty Beauty’s value at a “conservative $2.8 billion,” and since Rihanna owns half, that amounts to about $1.4 billion for her.

Another $270 million of her worth comes from Savage x Fenty, her lingerie company, which has also found success with a more inclusive approach than established competitors. It has a number of backers, among them L Catterton, the private equity firm owned in part by Bernard Arnault, CEO and majority shareholder of LVMH.

The ties between Rihanna and LVMH have generally been profitable for both, leading them to announce the launch of a full-fledged luxury fashion brand in 2019. It was one venture that didn’t succeed, however. It had difficulty building a clear identity, while its high prices—$700 for a shirt dress or $900 for high heels—left out many of the customers who otherwise line up for Fenty Beauty’s $22 lipstick and other products. In February, LVMH said it would put the line on pause."
How LVMH Beat The Pandemic - Jing Daily,"Mon, 02 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWJlYXQtcGFuZGVtaWMtaDEtMjAyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH reported 34 billion (28.7 billion euros) in revenue, up 56 percent compared to the first half of 2020 and up 14 percent over the first half of 2019.

These results from LVMH dramatically defied the market and show that the strategies many other brands deployed during the pandemic — playing “wait and see” or engaging in price reductions or promotions — were completely misguided.

A few years ago, Louis Vuitton’s shoe portfolio was comprised of dressier shoes and boots. Now, the brand’s footwear sector is most visible via its sneakers, including its new sustainable Charlie sneaker, made with innovative, recycled materials across 90 percent of the shoe.

The first half of 2021 has by no means been a “normal” half-year. Even if, by the end of 2020, most of us had hoped COVID-19 would be behind us, reality showed a starkly different picture. The pandemic had a fierce grip over the world, with countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa in turmoil and many critical European markets like UK, France, and Germany under partial lockdown. In many places around the world, the impact on retail was a reality many brands had to face. Last but not least, global travel restrictions were still widely in place, dramatically impacting the travel retail that was so critical to many luxury categories, such as alcohols, perfumes, high-end beauty, accessories, and sunglasses.

And while many markets recovered from the shocking first half of 2020, when the pandemic took the world by surprise, many companies are still feeling its impact on their top and bottom lines. I've had countless conversations with luxury brands worldwide, across many categories, that see a silver lining. Yet, their performances today are shaky at best.

In this context, the first-half performance of LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group by revenue and profitability, is even more remarkable. The group reported 34 billion (28.7 billion euros) in revenue, up 56 percent compared to the first half of 2020 and up 14 percent over the first half of 2019. Its net profit was a record 6.3 billion (5.3 billion euros), which is even more impressive when comparing it to the same period in the previous years (ten times higher than in the first half of 2020 and 62-percent above the first half of 2019). Bernard Arnault, the group’s chairman & CEO, commented that “LVMH has enjoyed an excellent half-year and is reaping the benefits of having continued to innovate and invest in its businesses throughout the pandemic despite being in the midst of a global crisis.”

These results reflect combining an unparalleled vision, some of the best management talents in the industry, a superior strategy, and excellence in execution. And they are nothing short of astounding. An impressive example is the Fashion & Leather Goods business group, comprised of iconic brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi, among others. It recorded organic revenue growth of 81 percent in the first half compared to 2020. Compared to the first half of 2019 (which was a record year, mind you), the growth was a stellar 38 percent. Its Wines & Spirits division, with brands like Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Dom Pérignon, and Hennessy, saw a record 44-percent organic revenue growth across the first half of this year compared to last year, with a 12-percent increase versus 2019.

These results dramatically defied the market and show that the strategies many other brands deployed during the pandemic — playing “wait and see” or engaging in price reductions or promotions — were completely misguided. The LVMH Maisons did the exact opposite.

In terms of innovation, category expansion, and creativity, 2020 and 2021 have been the most exciting periods for the LVMH group. Categories like sneakers, backpacks, and practical totes have become growth engines in a world where customers seek the highest combination of comfort and quality. A few years ago, Louis Vuitton’s shoe portfolio was comprised of dressier shoes and boots. Now, the brand’s footwear sector is most visible via its sneakers, including its new sustainable Charlie sneaker , made with innovative, recycled materials across 90 percent of the shoe. During a recent meeting in Europe, I spotted at least ten people wearing LV sneakers in a small gourmet restaurant, making it the most dominant footwear brand among that location's high-end clientele.

Icons like the Louis Vuitton Bandoulière were reimagined in different colors, designs, and sizes, making them collectibles while also usable everyday items. The recently introduced and highly desirable Louis Vuitton Light Up speaker marks the brand's entrance into luxury loudspeakers and the ecosystem surrounding them, including a 410 carrying strap. Meanwhile, the perfumes of Louis Vuitton already rank among the world’s best-selling fragrances. These are just some examples of how the group significantly expanded its footprint of iconic brands to reach new target groups and create an unprecedented amount of buzz.

At the same time, prices across most of its brands increased, and its limited editions, often priced in a non-linear way, reflected the desire of customers to differentiate and own unique pieces (ones that may be increasing in value due to their scarcity). The brand's digital capabilities were also significantly extended, both in distribution and in marketing.

That leads to a unique formula: aggressively entering new categories, exciting customers with creativity and rare limited editions, making significant investments in digital marketing, using powerful influencers, opening new digital channels, and permanently reinventing existing brands. While most other luxury brands played it safe, LVMH played to win — and significantly expanded its market shares across many segments. The house was not afraid to make bold moves and risk its status quo to connect strongly with young, affluent target groups.

These moves uniquely position LVMH to grow much more once the luxury market fully rebounds. Its market share gains during the crisis are predictors of future profits, assuming the company's Maisons continue to excite their customers.

What is even more impressive is that this performance occurred during its takeover of Tiffany & Co. A move like this would have distracted most other companies, causing them to lose focus on their core businesses. With 75 Maisons and an extremely diverse category portfolio catering to the most discerning customers, it would've been easy for LVMH to get lost in the takeover's complexities and underperform. LVMH did not only break all revenue and profit limits, but it also showed how a complex portfolio can be managed successfully with the right leadership and creative approach. Expect them to break even more limits.

"With His New LVMH Deal, Virgil Abloh Protected His Biggest Asset. Here's How. - Complex","Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvbGVpLXRha2FuYXNoaS92aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtbHZtaC1vZmYtd2hpdGUtZGVhbC1leHBsYWluZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Obviously over time, fashion labels fall from grace. When that time comes, what does LVMH do with its brands to keep them afloat? They eventually sold off brands like Donna Karan. But they’ve kept other labels that have struggled, like Marc Jacobs, afloat.

LVMH always seems to play a very long game and to develop lots of personal relationships. So I think that they’re investing in the brand Off-White. But more than that, they’re affirming the success of their relationship with Virgil as their creative director for menswear. They’re kind of confirming that it was a good bargain for both sides. And so I think what you saw with Donna Karan is that she ultimately wanted to step away from her brand. And they didn’t sell it out from under her. They sold it after she was gone. Granted, they brought in Public School to do the designing and unfortunately, the relationship with the brand didn’t last past the transition because the new owner G-Three didn’t keep them on. Similarly, the Marc Jacobs brand has ebbed and flowed with time. But they’re still supporting Marc Jacobs. But it’s really a family owned company that seems to treat its creative directors like family. So I don’t see them doing something that an uninformed venture capitalist might do, which is to buy it, milk it, and sell it. It is not the LVMH style. It’s not what they’ve done over decades now with other brands. So none of us see Off-White declining soon when it comes to its stature in the streetwear world or the fashion world. In fact, it’s really inspiring lots of other companies to believe that traditional luxury can be a lot more open to different kinds of participation. So it’s still very much a trend-setter. But inevitably decades from now, when it becomes less cool, I still don’t think that LVMH would drop it flat. They would find ways to help it maintain its level and find a new foot.

LVMH has fired designers like Galliano in the past. Does LVMH now have the power to replace Virgil as the creative director of Off-White? With or without his approval?

Obviously, you and I can’t see the contract. But I’m sure that there are protections, on both sides. There are protections for Virgil and I’m sure there are protections for LVMH. So moral clauses are very common. And so if Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs are different kinds of LVMH success stories, John Galliano left because the designer had a personal breakdown. And we all heard that horribly racist anti-semitic rant he went on. And he has done the work, gone through therapy, and moved on in his personal career. But LVMH had to take a dramatic step, and they did very quickly, to distance themselves from that individual behavior. Any time you have a creative director or executive who is very high profile, and is very much associated with that brand, that person lends credibility to it. They can uplift the brand when they’re doing well and when they have a meltdown, it can harm the brand. So the brand has to be able to cut off the gangrene, when necessary. And if that sometimes means cutting off your own limb to save the body, that’s what you have to do. Of course, there’s a possibility for any designer to have some kind of crazy meltdown. And LVMH is betting that it won’t with Virgil, as they bet on everybody. But hopefully fashion in general has learned to support its people a little better and pay attention to when someone is struggling. I think the lessons of Galliano, the lessons of the Alexander McQueen, and others who have either gone off the rails or committed suicide, speak to the pressure of being the creative spark driving a multi-billion dollar brand. So hopefully we won’t see that ever happen. But if it does, there are ways that a corporation has to deal with that.

Since they’re investing so much in Virgil as a person, I hope they give attention to what Virgil needs as a person. I honestly think that the pandemic has made us think in those terms as well. Mental health is important. It’s why Simone Biles walking away from the Olympics, is something that she’s been applauded and celebrated for by and large. Because she’s drawn attention to mental health and she has a self-awareness about what she needs as a person. Right. That’s true, despite the fact that she has not only an entire nation rooting for her and the gymnastics community around the world who were rooting for her, but lots of corporate sponsors.

So it’s something that the corporate world has had to grapple with recently. And so I feel like the world is in a different place now than we were when Galliano went off the rails and the solution was like, cut that off quickly. I’m hopeful that if we ever had a high profile creative director or other individual under pressure and showing signs of a potential crack, or breakdown, that a corporation would be able to address that upfront rather than letting it turn into a crisis."
Cipriani chairman puts LVMH on blast over alleged knock-off restaurant: 'I'm not flattered by imitation' - Fox Business,"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnJpZ28tY2lwcmlhbmktc2xhbXMtbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb3Zlci1rbm9jay1vZmYtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1ub3QtZmxhdHRlcmVkLWltaXRhdGlvbtIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnJpZ28tY2lwcmlhbmktc2xhbXMtbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb3Zlci1rbm9jay1vZmYtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1ub3QtZmxhdHRlcmVkLWltaXRhdGlvbi5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Italian restaurateur Arrigo Cipriani, whose family legacy in authentic fine dining stretches across the globe, says he was stunned to learn that LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, one of the richest men in the world, seemingly imitated his brand.

""I'm very surprised that he thought he was able to copy my soul. You cannot copy that. Absolutely, there is no way you can,"" the 89-year-old second-generation Cipriani Chairman told Fox Business in an interview this week from the famous Harry's Bar in Venice that his late father Giuseppe Cipriani founded in 1931 and of which he was named after.

The alleged knock-off Arrigo Cipriani is referring to is Restaurant Cipriani in Saint-Tropez, which opened its doors on July 7. Despite the new digs bearing his family's well-known last name, Restaurant Cipriani in Saint-Tropez is not the product of Arrigo or his son, Giuseppe Cipriani, who is the CEO of Cipriani. Instead, it's owned by French luxury giant LVMH , of which billionaire Arnault is the chairman and CEO .

LVMH was allowed to open a restaurant with the name Cipriani thanks to a trademark the brand registered for in the EU in multiple categories, including hospitality.

Arrigo is understanding of LVMH's right to own a business with his family name, but his issue, he says, comes down to the finer details. He claims the new restaurant has ripped off the very precise elements his father Giuseppe and the generations after him successfully created: the logo, furniture, and design, down to the tableware, tablecloths, the chairs, and menu items.

WHO IS BERNARD ARNAULT?

Arrigo claims photos of his restaurants – there are nearly 20 Cipriani Group locations around the world in places like Venice, Moscow, New York, Las Vegas, and Abu Dhabi – next to Saint-Tropez's Restaurant Cipriani show glaring similarities. Mainly, Arrigo balks at the wooden chairs, the arrangement of the round dishes and glassware, and the look-alike carpaccio, a popular dish invented by his father in 1950. Giuseppe's carpaccio consists of paper-thin raw filet mignon with a white sauce drizzled on the meat in a lattice design.

""Arnault, if you do a place, copy the chefs, copy the table, copy the bellini, copy the carpaccio, name it Cipriani, you're confusing people,"" Arrigo tells Fox Business.

The 89-year-old also reminded us his father created the Bellini cocktail, inspired by the fifteenth-century Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini. The drink is sold at most bars and restaurants, including LVMH's Cipriani.

WHAT IS BERNARD ARNAULT'S NET WORTH?

Reps for LVMH and Arnault did not return Fox Business' requests for comment.

""The chairs designed by my father – you cannot change them. He created things with the vision of wanting his customers to feel free. So the chairs designed by my father, they are at the right height. The tables are at the right height. The forks and knives, they're small because they balance in your hand and you don't even know you use them. The plates are round. Everything is studied to make the customer comfortable,"" Arrigo explains.

Despite Saint-Tropez's Cipriani's alleged similarities, Arrigo laughs off any questions about being angry or wanting to take the matter to court. The latter, he says, he has ""no interest"" in doing but points out it would ultimately be a decision for his son Giuseppe to make.

""I'm not angry. I'm surprised,"" he said. ""I thought that Mr. Arnault was much more intelligent than that. He's used to a different kind of luxury.""

Arnault, who oversees 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Moet Chandon, Sephora, Dior and, most recently, Tiffany & Co., is too subject to copycats, Arrigo argued.

""You can copy a handbag. Still, a copy is always a copy, even of the best handbag in the world. It's strange that a man who is always afraid that people will copy his handbags and he thinks of copying my plates in Saint-Tropez. He will realize soon that he made a mistake.""

Arrigo claimed that the loyal patrons of his family's restaurants, many of which boast a celebrity clientele, have already called out the ""fake"" Cipriani in Saint-Tropez.

""I already hear customers that say nothing is the same, the food, the service is not the same. People that go to Harry's bar or any of my restaurants know exactly what they came for, what they want. You go to another place even if it has the same name and they don't get what they're expecting then they'll never go back. That's it. I can assure them.""

CHEESECAKE FACTORY DEVELOPING LOYALTY PROGRAM AS PART OF MARKETING PUSH

Reviews of the LVMH's Cipriani on TripAdvisor are mixed but some repeat Arrigo's claims. One alleged visitor from July commented, ""Avoid this Cipriani restaurant its a fake its not owned by the Cipriani family! They copied Giuseppe Cipriani's restaurants."" Another critic claimed their dining experience was ""disappointing.""

""It's definitely not a real Cipriani,"" another reads. ""It is using the name as a franchise.""

A more recent review, however, refers to it as the ""best summer spot in Saint Tropez.""

At the end of the day, the Cipriani Chairman says he's confident people will recognize the imitations used by the Cipriani restaurant in France all on their own. And in the meantime, Arrigo says his family will continue to perfect their expanding brand for their customers.

""I'm not flattered by imitation,"" Arrigo said. ""I'm flattered by the customers saying how good we are and how wonderful the food is. That's the only thing I'm flattered by."""

» The making of a luxury titan: Aquisitions & Milestones

» Fresh focus: Remaking Tiffany & Co.

Most people are astonished by the size and dynamics of the luxury market. Intuitively, they assume luxury is a niche business – even people who work for luxury brands share this outlook.

But what many underestimate is a luxury brand’s enormous value creation potential.

This year, 2021, marks a historic moment for the luxury industry. All brands are hoping for better performances than last year and a speedy recovery for the European and North American luxury markets.

Both regions fared poorly during the pandemic, with some categories losing 50 per

cent or more of their market in these geographic regions, which many of the world’s most- admired luxury brands call home.

However, with the pandemic still raging across the first quarter of 2021, and most key European markets in strict lockdowns, the news that Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) became Europe’s most valuable company might have come as a surprise.

According to data analyzed by Finaria, the French luxury conglomerate reached a staggering $US319.4 billion (€264.6 billion) as of February 26, 2021, surpassing Nestlé, the Swiss food giant.

What’s driving this all-time-high valuation is how the luxury group used 2020 better than other luxury houses and put itself in the pole position for when the markets returned to – relatively – normal trading.

In short, their strategy execution is a masterpiece of extreme value creation from which other brands can learn.

What many businesses don’t fully understand is that consumers don’t buy luxury for the product itself, but for the brand’s exclusive value – which I describe using the term ‘Added Luxury Value’ (ALV).

ALV is fascinating yet at the same time tricky. It is a value that results from psychological effects that make our brains attribute positive aspects – such as higher attractiveness, more expertise, a better life, and more self-esteem – to a person who buys or showcases a luxury item or brand.

In other words, a luxury handbag or luxury watch ensures you are perceived as smarter, more attractive, and more fun to be with, according to my research.

It is an automatic, archaic response in our brains that we cannot deny. Studies in Europe, China, Japan, and North America confirmed that the ALV effect is universal – regardless of how much we like luxury and independent of age or other variables.

Even the product is mostly irrelevant, as this desire is driven primarily by the perceived story about the brand.

Hence, brands with powerful stories that create desire can add significant premiums due to the rare value they produce; it is not only the raw materials, but what the branded product represents, that the consumer purchases.

If your business’ brand creates high perceived consumer value, you can price for it and achieve profitability far beyond other categories; conversely, if brands cannot develop powerful stories, offer consistent experiences, or price their products correctly, ALV either does not develop or collapses completely.

And once it’s gone, it rarely returns.

That is why many brands in the luxury sector decline quickly or never take off at all – managing ALV is a core task in luxury, and few brands spend the proper time on it.

Unsurprisingly, LVMH is a master of storytelling and brand experience creation. Its founder and CEO, Bernard Arnault – who briefly became the world’s richest man in May – famously described luxury as “the ability to create desire”; the greater the lust, the higher the value creation.

In turn, more customers flock to the brands with the highest value creation and are willing to pay prices that correspond to that value.

Jeweller Research

So how is that value achieved? The answer is with a combination of the best managers in luxury and uniquely talented creatives like Dior’s Kim Jones and Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh.

A good example is the acquisition of Rimowa in October 2016. Before LVMH controlled the luggage brand, it was without a clear profile or quality brand storytelling.

It overemphasised its heritage – displaying almost a complete lack of innovation – and exclusively sold products wholesale, with little oversight of how they were merchandised or marketed. This impacted consumers’ ‘brand experience’ significantly.

As CEO, Alexandre Arnault – Bernard’s 29-year-old son, who reportedly convinced his father to pursue the acquisition – cleaned up the 122-year-old brand’s distribution, removing wholesalers and promotions, significantly increasing prices, and making the brand a disruptive force.

Because of Rimowa’s efforts, carry-on luggage became as desirable as handbags for the first time in history, with seasonal collections that created the urge among wealthy travellers to showcase their newest and latest Rimowa holdalls.

The Off-White x Rimowa transparent trolley quickly became an instant hit, as did a collaboration with streetwear brand Supreme.

“Brands with powerful stories that create desire can add significant premiums due to the rare value they produce; it is not only the raw materials, but what the branded product represents, that the consumer purchases.”

Then, with travel limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rimowa switched to backpacks and more practical items that people could use every day.

As a result, Rimowa became the perfect example of how a lagging brand can transform into a creative luxury powerhouse with a compelling brand story.

During the pandemic, LVMH acquired the famed jeweller Tiffany & Co. I expect the company to give the brand a complete transformation similar to Rimowa’s, which will breathe new life and significant growth into the iconic American brand which already enjoys massive appeal in Asia.

With an injection of creativity and ‘experience creation’, as well as more coherent pricing and assortment strategies, Tiffany will have enormous potential to expand. Notably, Alexandre Arnault left his CEO role at Rimowa earlier this year to join

Tiffany & Co. as its executive vice-president of product and communication.

In March, LVMH named Ruba Abu-Nimah – a creative director, design and experiential consultant – as Tiffany’s creative director, with Cartier’s Nathalie Verdeille as vice-president and artistic director of jewellery and high jewellery, appointed in July.

CHART A + TABLE 2: LVMH Composition by product Category & Revenue

Unlike many other luxury houses, LVMH has refrained from lowering prices or from promoting during the pandemic – a strategy that I suggest is the best practice for luxury brands.

In fact, brands like Dior introduced price increases, reflecting the extreme value its brand creates.

Another of LVMH’s strong characteristics is that it isn’t afraid of making tough decisions.

One such decision was putting Fenty – the glamorous fashion house it created together with pop singer Rihanna – on hold in February 2021.

Rumours about Fenty’s disappointing results and the high cost of establishing a new brand led LVMH to shift its focus to more promising and scalable brands for the time being.

In 2020, key LVMH brands like Dior continued to expand digitally by experimenting with newer platforms like TikTok while other luxury brands were reluctant and slow to adapt.

As such, the Dior x Air Jordan limited edition shoe created one of the highest instances of ‘digital demand’ ever, with more than 5 million people attempting to buy the shoes over the Dior website.

This increased resale prices of the limited edition shoes to between $US10,000–$20,000, depending on the platform. That initiative alone shows the power of ALV.

The ability to consistently manage a complex brand portfolio with the primary focus of creating desire and ALV – and translating that extreme value into higher prices explains LVMH’s success story and has driven its market valuation to unprecedented heights.

The company’s brands have been among the best managed during the pandemic, connecting strongly with their customer groups while always innovating.

LVMH provides a lesson for other luxury brands: if you focus on the excellent execution of a strong brand story, avoid the urge to promote, and digitally engage with your customer base in tough times, then you will be rewarded in customer desire, larger revenues, and higher profitability.

The current surge behind LVMH reflects that investors believe the company is well-positioned to lead, even in a pandemic.

Do people have that kind of faith in your brand?

FRESH FOCUS

REMAKING TIFFANY Since acquiring the American jewellery juggernaut in January 2021, LVMH has undertaken a full-scale transition of its executive leadership. Veterans of its other divisions – including senior management from Louis Vuitton and Rimowa – have taken the reins, with creative positions filled by executives from brands such as Cartier and Revlon. Among plans for store renovations and pop-ups – including the successful yellow store on Los Angeles’ Rodeo Drive, to accompany the Tiffany Diamond – LVMH has also indicated it will invest significantly in expanding the Tiffany & Co. brand worldwide. Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer LVMH, told investors earlier this year, “Integrating Tiffany is very important to us... [The company is] a big acquisition for us [and] our number one priority. “It will take years to do what we want to do with this brand, from a distribution, merchandising, and marketing viewpoint. It is a lot of work – we are committed to doing it.” High-profile new celebrity spokespeople have been announced in recent months, including actresses Anya Taylor-Joy (top right) and Tracee Ellis Ross (top center), Olympian Eileen Gu, Blackpink singer Roseanne ‘Rose´’ Park (top left), and performer Jackson Yee.

"LVMH's Top Brands Continue to Take Market Share From Smaller Competitors, Per Polen Capital - The Fashion Law","Mon, 30 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtY28tY29udGludWUtdG8tdGFrZS1tYXJrZXQtc2hhcmUtZnJvbS1zbWFsbGVyLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLXBlci1wb2xlbi1jYXBpdGFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s most recent quarterly results suggest that the sales-specific impact of COVID-19 “is passing,” with strength in “numerous categories from Fashion & Leather goods to Wines & Spirits and across continents implying a broad-based recovery in demand for luxury goods” despite the striking drops in sales that have plagued luxury players as a result of the pandemic. In its Q2 letter to investors, investment management firm Polen Capital says that it is continuing to bet on the Paris-based conglomerate, holding that the group – which reported in late July that it generated $33.7 billion in revenue for the first half of the year (up from $21.7 billion in H1 of 2020) – is “poised to continue growing its total returns to shareholders at a low double-digit rate over the coming five years.”

Looking specifically at the Bernard Arnault-run group’s top revenue-generating brands within the Fashion & Leather Goods division, Polen stated that both Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior “maintained their leadership [in the market],” which the firm says “suggests that the largest luxury brands are continuing to take market share from smaller competitors,” including privately-held ones, as the luxury market as a whole continues to make gains. This is in line with findings from Jefferies analysts, who estimated last month that LVMH’s share of the global personal luxury-goods market has risen from a pre-pandemic 10 percent to roughly 16 percent, helped along, at least in part by its acquisition of Tiffany & Co. LVMH’s growth comes as the global market for personal luxury goods, as a whole, rose by 5 percent between 2019 and 2021, according to Bain, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.

The success of conglomerate-held brands in the midst of the pandemic – and rising costs of competing against them in the digital battle field, where many luxury brands were slow to adapt – has opened the door to a steady stream of merger-and-acquisitions, with Etro, Jil Sander, Pucci, Sergio Rossi, Tod’s, and Christian Louboutin, among others, selling off stakes since the onset of the pandemic. And if M&A chatter is any indication, more deals are likely to come, as a handful of key brands remain in independent hands.

Addressing LVMH’s acquisition of Tiffany & Co. Polen stated that the famed jewelry company showed “a promising start to the year,” but noted that “management cautioned that turning this recently acquired business around would take ‘years, not quarters.’”

The Rise & Role of E-Comm

Another key takeaway for Polen was LVMH’s increased reliance on e-commerce, which it says “continues to power results during lockdowns.” In its first half report, LVMH specifically highlighted the role that e-commerce has played within its Perfumes & Cosmetics division, stating that its brands “are benefiting from continued growth in online sales, partially offsetting the impact of the suspension of international travel and the closure of many points of sale.” It similarly pin-pointed the “progress” of online sales on a global basis in connection with its Selective Retailing business group, under which Sephora falls. The cosmetics chain revealed in June that it would further expand its digital reach by partnering with Berlin-based e-commerce company Zalando in order to create “an unrivalled online prestige beauty experience for European customers.” That venture is expected to launch later this year.

“Despite recent strength [in the e-commerce space],” Polen asserts that “LVMH management believes luxury shopping will be an omnichannel experience, with discovery happening online but purchases happening in stores.” This seems particularly likely for brands like Louis Vuitton, for instance, which has significantly bolstered its online offerings, but still does not appear to offer its entire collection for sale online. Of the 466 handbag styles that appear on Louis Vuitton’s e-commerce site, for instance, only 134 are marked as “available online.” At least some of the items are not listed as available online, as they are “out of stock,” but others require consumers to call for availability.

In this same vein, it will be interesting to see what approach Phoebe Philo takes when she launches her new LVMH-backed eponymous label early next year. The former Celine creative director adamantly opposed social media and e-commerce when it came to the advertising and sale of her quiet-but-pricey offerings. While that approach may have worked in the past, the new demands that have come about as a result of the pandemic, both in terms of mandated lockdowns and corresponding store closures, and in wavering consumer comfort in shopping in-store as opposed to online, particularly in light of the recent onset of the Delta variant, have forced formerly online-resistant brands to embrace digital shopping experiences for fear of missing out on tens of billions of dollars’ worth of sales.

Uncertainty in the Chinese Market

What still remains to be seen is how luxury goods groups like LVMH will fare amid impending crackdowns on rising wealth inequality in China, which have the stock market spooked and luxury brands in a potentially problematic position, given their large-scale reliance on Chinese consumers for a huge portion of their revenues and growth. While striking stock drops for the likes of LVMH, Kering, and Hermès, among others, on the heels of Xi Jinping’s August 17 call for wealth redistribution, have stabilized, uncertainty continues to loom in light of the messaging coming out of Beijing.

In a note last week, Jefferies analysts Flavio Cereda and Kathryn Parker stated that they believe that the situation in China “is likely to result in some change in spending habits [for the fast-growing cohort of high spenders], certainly in terms of visibility, and may also tweak the marketing campaign of brands.” In addition to changes in the nature and content of brands’ marketing efforts, the looks of their wares very well may be impacted, as well, with a shift towards less ostentatious uses of logos – and even a move away from pricey materials like exotic skins, etc., which have typically been promoted in heavy-spending markets like China – likely to come into play due to the planned crackdowns on excess wealth. This could prove to be damaging to brands, which rely heavily on the margins of logo-heavy offerings, for instance.

At the same time, brands will also be notably impacted by any additional taxes that are levied on luxury goods. Although, it is unclear if that is the route that the government plans to take, particularly given its sweeping efforts in recent years to get consumers shopping on the mainland. That effort has been helped along significantly by the onset and enduring effect of COVID, but it is not a given that once borders open again, Chinese consumers will not resume their old ways of buying tens of billions of dollars’ worth of luxury goods beyond China’s borders."

A return of 5.57% was delivered by the fund for the Q2 of 2021, outperforming its MSCI All Country World benchmark that delivered a 5.47% return for the same period. You can take a look at the fund’s top 5 holdings to have an idea about their top bets for 2021.

In the Q2 2021 investor letter of Polen Capital, the fund mentioned LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE: LVMUY) and discussed its stance on the firm. LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne is a Paris, France-based luxury goods company with a $368.3 billion market capitalization. LVMUY delivered a 16.71% return since the beginning of the year, extending its 12-month returns to 53.82%. The stock closed at $146.95 per share on August 25, 2021.

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne in its Q2 2021 investor letter:

""Paris-headquartered luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) delivered favorable financial results during the past quarter. Although rolling coronavirus lockdowns continued into 2021 and kept numerous LVMH stores closed, these results indicate to us that the pandemic’s impact is passing. Strength in numerous categories from Fashion and Leather goods to Wines and Spirits and across continents imply, in our opinion, a broad-based recovery in demand for luxury goods. In high fashion, both Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior maintained their leadership, which we believe suggests that the largest luxury brands are continuing to take market share from smaller competitors. Tiffany is showing a promising start to the year, but management cautioned that turning this recently acquired business around would take “years, not quarters.” E-commerce continues to power results during lockdowns. Despite recent strength, online LVMH management believes luxury shopping will be an omnichannel experience, with discovery happening online but purchases happening in stores. We think LVMH is poised to continue growing its total returns to shareholders at a low double-digit rate over the coming five years.""

LVMH-Backed Company Leads €100 Million Funding in Amazon Seller - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbHZtaC1iYWNrZWQtY29tcGFueS1sZWFkcy0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1mdW5kaW5nLWluLWFtYXpvbi1zZWxsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin-based start-up SellerX has raised €100 million ($117 million) in funding, led by LVMH-backed investment firm L Catterton, to buy brands sold via Amazon.com Inc. and Shopify Inc.

Founded in 2020, SellerX has so far bought more than 30 e-commerce brands that mainly sell their wares through the world’s largest e-commerce sites, and plans to use the new cash to double that number over the coming year, co-founder Philipp Triebel said in an interview.

Rivals including Berlin Brands Group and Thrasio have raised billions of dollars from investors, who are betting that the rise of start-ups combining hundreds of direct-to-consumer brands will continue to grow.

While SellerX is focused on brands with much of their sales on Amazon, co-founder Malte Horeyseck said that the company has also bought sellers with significant operations on Shopify, and that they may buy sellers purely focused on that platform in the future.

SellerX has already raised around €250 million of debt and equity, the company said in a statement, and Triebel added that the new equity funding puts the company in a strong position to raise more debt in the future.

Other investors participating in the round included Sofina and existing backers Cherry Ventures, Felix Capital and 83North.

“This isn’t just about rolling up great brands and great products, it goes beyond this. This is the very future of how consumer products are developed and brought to market,” said Christopher North, managing partner of L Catterton’s growth fund. “I expect they will continue to acquire at a blistering pace.”

Courts Controversy With Start of New Revamp, What is the Risk at Play? - The Fashion Law","Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2FzLWx2bWgtb3duZWQtdGlmZmFueS1jby1jb3VydHMtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktd2l0aC1zdGFydC1vZi1uZXctcmV2YW1wLXdoYXQtaXMtdGhlLXJpc2stYXQtcGxheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. is courting controversy, and it is not mincing words in the process. The New York-headquartered jewelry stalwart very unambiguously announced late last month – via an ad campaign that swept Instagram and found a home on the sides of buildings and barricades in New York and Los Angeles – that its new products are, well … “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany.” The response to the campaign was as swift as it was fractured. Many longtime Tiffany & Co. customers expressed feelings of exclusion and frustration as a result of the new millennial and Gen-Z-centric push. Some called the new positioning ageist; others characterized it as lazy, uninspired marketing – a “cop out” even. “There is nothing unique or special about claiming that a brand is contemporary,” branding and marketing consultant Leigh George stated. Even some young consumers – i.e., the ones being wooed – were put off by the tone.

At the very same time, other consumers did not appear to be quite so dismayed, either approaching the campaign in a more light-hearted manner, maybe? – and/or simply not feeling targeted by the new “not your mother’s” message.

The campaign is one of the first major marketing moves since Tiffany & Co. assumed its position under the expansive ownership umbrella of LVMH in December 2020. And it comes as part of a new multi-prong, multi-year repositioning project being spearheaded by newly-installed EVP of Products and Communication Alexandre Arnault, 29, who is fresh from a successful revamp of German luggage brand Rimowa, and Tiffany’s new creative director Ruba Abu-Nimah. Ultimately, it is part of a “super aggressive change,” as former Amazon executive creative director Anthony Reeves put it, aimed at modernizing the brand that got its start almost two centuries ago and has been readily waning in relevance.

He emphasized the need for “common prosperity” while promoting development, moving the committee to outline a plan to regulate and redistribute excessive wealth.

As reports of the meeting emerged the next day, they sent a shudder through luxury investors.

Chinese shoppers have been loyal to luxury brands

Behind the panic is an acknowledgment that many luxury companies depend on Chinese shoppers for a large share of their sales. And the industry’s reliance on China had been forecast to increase further in the years ahead.

What should help insulate luxury businesses from political moves targeting the wealthiest Chinese is that much of the sales growth in China is occurring among the country’s rapidly expanding middle class. The committee indicated its intent to create more of an “olive-shaped” society, with the bulk of the Chinese people being middle income and only small numbers of the extremely rich or poor.

China’s policies have hurt luxury brands before

China’s government has shown that its actions can have real effects on luxury sales. From about 2012 to 2014, an anti-corruption crackdown targeting the exchange of lavish gifts caused sales of items such as pricey Swiss watches to plunge in China.

In an Aug. 18 note to clients, investment bank UBS pointed out that the anti-corruption campaign was narrower in scope and only affected a small number of high-end categories. Even so, “a slowdown among the sector’s largest nationality would likely have a negative impact on sales and as such the development of the situation is likely to be carefully watched by the market,” it said.

Luxury and inequality

While incomes in China have risen overall, the gap between rich and poor has grown significantly, provoking concern around the country. Beijing has indicated it doesn’t intend to let it widen indefinitely and is said to be considering policies such as new taxes on property and inheritance.

Such policies could have ripple effects in luxury sales. “Luxury demand doesn’t just come from bubbles here and there but from Gini coefficient type disparities,” HSBC wrote, referring to a measure of income inequality. “A good example of that has been the K-shaped [pandemic] recovery in the US where wealthy individuals benefited from the stock market, secondary home markets and ‘staycationing’ and had more means to spend and did just that.” (For more on the Gini coefficient, read this.)

The Chinese government has yet to detail exactly how its goals will translate to policy, so it’s hard to predict how its plans might affect the incomes of wealthy shoppers. But it’s clear China’s efforts to curb inequality are shaking the confidence of investors, and could do the same for luxury shoppers. As HSBC noted, “luxury demand is likely more correlated to wealthy consumers’ psychology more than just to financial means.”"
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Is Again World's Richest Man - WWD,"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJlem9zLXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi0xMjM0ODk0NDg4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BACK ON TOP: Luxury titan Bernard Arnault is again the world’s richest man, according to Forbes. The chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton bumped Jeff Bezos from the top slot with a net worth of $199.9 billion, topping the Amazon founder and chairman’s $194.9 billion. Tesla founder Elon Musk was in third with a net worth of $185.5 billion.

While Bezos has been busy blasting himself into space via his Blue Origin rocket, Amazon’s shares haven’t been quite as lofty of late, slumping on Friday to $3,344.94 after hitting a one-month high on July 12 of $3,761. LVMH’s shares, meanwhile, have gone in the other direction, and on Friday rose slightly to close at 698.2 euros. The shares have been driven by LVMH’s strong results for the first half, driven by its fashion and leather goods brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and buoyant demand for luxury goods in Asia and the U.S. as well as recovery in Europe. Arnault’s empire encompasses 75 brands ranging from Dom Pérignon Champagne and Cheval Blanc wine to the La Samaritaine and Bon Marché department stores and Bulgari jewelry.

And while Arnault might not be donning a jumpsuit, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat to go into space, he does have a new blue bauble he can call his very own: iconic jeweler Tiffany, which LVMH acquired last year for $15.8 billion and is in the process of buffing up. Clearly the stock market prefers diamonds to star dust."

The French start-up claims to have created the first recycling chain dedicated to unsold textiles, rolls of fabric and offcuts from major fashion houses by transforming them into new yarns and fabrics that are 100% traceable and European-made.



Through this recycling chain customers are given access to a network of logistics specialists, recyclers, spinners and textile manufacturers who try to conserve resources and raw materials by prolonging their life span. By combining digital sorting and low-cost collection tools, Weturn says that it can develop and distribute new materials at competitive prices aligned with the market.



While according to statistics, the closed-loop recycling rate in the textile industry is currently varying and it is difficult to receive reliable data, Weturn’s initiative wants to provide planning security and to allow fashion houses to recycle their unsold products protected by intellectual property, after considering donation and reuse solutions, to create new eco-designed textiles.

Therefore, Weturn works with several LVMH Group Maisons to support them in recycling their textiles and to help them reuse these recycled materials in future products (packaging, accessories, fabrics for workshops, uniforms for teams or research projects for integration into ready-to-wear products), intended for the original Maisons or other brands and designers in the market. The start-up states that it provides the fashion industry with a solution for achieving recycling rates of over 50%, while offering the promise of transparency through a traceability chain, from collection to reuse.As for LVMH, the group has set various objectives through its Life 360 environmental program and, for example, by 2030 wants all its new products to follow an eco-design approach, with a controlled environmental footprint, from the extraction of materials to their processing, and its whole strategic supply chains to have a dedicated traceability system.“Today, this partnership [with Weturn] allows us to take a new step towards achieving our ambition in the field of creative circularity, which is one of the four strategic priorities of Life 360, our environmental policy for the next 10 years. As our designers continue to integrate more and more upcycling into their collections, as the Nona Source platform enables them to obtain high-quality unused fabrics and leathers , and as Cedre [a company specialized in waste collection] intervenes in the end-of-life of products, Weturn offers our Maisons the opportunity to recycle their unsold finished products, branded fabrics and textile packaging in the form of spools of thread.

The deal means users who search for Bulgari on JD.com will be redirected to a special Bulgari mini-programme operated within the JD.com infrastructure. In essence, Bulgari products with be available in a separate store within JD.com, but not directly on its platform alongside other brands.

“[This] customised and innovative model is a brand new exploration for both of us, and both sides will explore in-depth cooperation in the future to enhance the consumer experience and better meet the personalised needs of consumers while purchasing luxury goods online,” said Kevin Jiang, president of International Fashion and Lifestyle at JD.com.

It’s a similar arrangement to that of Louis Vuitton, which also chose JD.com as its first third-party e-commerce partner in April. In that case, users who search for “LV” on JD.com are redirected to Louis Vuitton’s official WeChat mini-programme where a full range of the brand’s products are available to purchase (WeChat owner Tencent also owns a 17.1 percent stake in JD.com and the two are generally considered allies in China’s highly-competitive tech landscape).

Other LVMH-owned brands to partner with JD.com recently include Berluti and Givenchy Beauty, both brands opened flagship stores on the platform in July. As of April, JD.com said it has over 500 million annual active users on its platform.

The deepening of ties between the world’s largest luxury conglomerate and JD.com comes as Chinese tech companies face intense scrutiny by regulators. In particular, the practice of “er xuan yi”, or “choose one of two”, which essentially forced merchants into exclusive partnerships with one of China’s major platforms has been a major target of the crackdown, which led to a record $2.8 billion fine for e-commerce leader Alibaba earlier this year.

A significant aspect of the agreements struck with LVMH Group brands and JD.com is their flexibility. Brands are joining the platform in a variety of ways and seemingly on their own terms, a significant departure from the previous status quo in China’s hotly contested e-commerce environment.

Louis Vuitton's CEO now worth $200 billion — here's how to invest in the world's richest - Yahoo Finance,"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9ucy1jZW8tbm93LXdvcnRoLTE2MDAwMDYyOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton's CEO now worth $200 billion — here's how to invest in the world's richest

Most of the world’s richest people are household names at this point: Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates.

Yet Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, has surpassed them all to become No. 1 — and now his family's net worth has hit a colossal $200 billion.

Here's how this French tycoon became the second person in history to achieve that milestone, and how investors (even those with limited funds) can steal a piece of his success.

Who is Bernard Arnault?

IAN LANGSDON/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock

Arnault is the face behind LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), a luxury empire that includes not just the three iconic brands in the company’s name but also such revered fashion houses as Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

Other brands you may recognize include Dom Pérignon champagne, Sephora cosmetics — and just this past January, his company acquired Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion.

His father, Jean Arnault, made his fortune in construction, and the younger Arnault started his career working for him, eventually taking over as president in 1979.

Five years later, for $15 million, he bought up Boussac Saint-Frères, a company whose assets included Christian Dior. Then, in 1988, he maneuvered to take a majority stake in LVMH.

By the mid-’90s, LVMH’s value had multiplied 15 times over, and sales and profits increased fivefold.

How did he become the world’s richest man?

Forbes’ list of top billionaires has long been populated by American names, but Arnault made it into the top 10 back in 2005.

He inched his way to the top five by 2018, and a year later, he clinched the top three with a $76 billion fortune.

Even the pandemic — which put an end to retail shopping, fancy galas and international travel — couldn't derail his trip to the top.

Luxury sales have recovered surprisingly quickly, particularly as conditions improve in China, and LVMH’s stock price continues to soar.

In late May, LVMH’s stock rose 0.4% in the first hours of trading, adding $600 million to Arnault’s personal fortune and knocking Amazon's Bezos off his pedestal.

Story continues

Arnault and Bezos have traded places a few times, but at time of writing, Bezos is firmly in the No. 2 spot with a net worth of ""just"" $190 billion.

How to invest in the world's richest

LVMH stock isn’t traded on the major U.S. exchanges. But that doesn’t mean you can’t buy in.

One way to get shares is by way of the company’s unsponsored ADR, or American depositary receipt, which is a U.S.-bank-issued certificate that can be traded like regular stock.

The ADR is only available on the over-the-counter market, though, which is more complicated to navigate than the markets you're probably used to.

A much easier way to grab some LVMH stock is through any of the luxury-themed ETFs that include LVMH.

With modern investing apps, it’s simple to add any ETF to your portfolio. Once your portfolio is set up, some apps will even automatically invest your “spare change” so your money is always growing in the background.

And if you want to spread out your risk by investing in Arnault’s rivals for world’s richest, you can always buy a bit of Amazon, Tesla or Berkshire Hathaway. Full shares in those companies cost $3,293, $717 and $432,900, as of this writing — but with fractional shares you can spend however much you like.

Where to go from there

If you’re keen to get into investing like a luxury tycoon, but there’s not much room in your budget right now, you have a few options to find some extra funds.

Bundle up your debt. If you’re struggling to pay off multiple debts and high interest rates, consider rolling your debts into one. You can chip away at your debt faster with a lower-interest debt consolidation loan.

Slash your insurance premiums. When was the last time you looked around for a better price on your auto insurance? If it’s been a while, it may be costing you more than $1,000 extra every year. Shop around to ensure you’re paying the best possible rate. And while you’re at it, use the same technique to save hundreds on health insurance, too.

Save big without clipping coupons. Even if you’ve trimmed your budget down to the bare necessities, you’ll still need to stock up on essentials here and there. When that time comes, use a free browser extension that will scour the internet for better prices and coupons.

But while Rihanna has plenty of songs that have topped Billboard charts, it’s her fashion and beauty endeavours that built much of the wealth.

Rihanna’s lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, is worth some $270 million, while her Fenty Beauty line is worth about $2.8 billion, Forbes estimated. Rihanna owns 50 percent of the LVMH-backed beauty line and 30 percent of her lingerie line.

Fenty Beauty is often celebrated for its inclusive colour range, with the “Fenty effect” pushing other brands to also offer 40 different foundation shades. In 2018, sales topped $550 million, beating competing celebrity brands like Kim Kardashian West’s KKW Beauty and Jessica Alba’s Honest Company.

Since debuting her makeup line in 2017, Rihanna has gone on to launch a skincare line, and most recently, a gender-free fragrance. Some other endeavours have fallen flat, like her high-end fashion line with LVMH, which launched in 2019 and was shuttered in February 2021.

According to a report from Forbesi, the 33-year-old Grammy winner-slash-makeup mogul has an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion, with a substantial portion of that coming by way of her 50 percent ownership stake in Fenty Beauty (LVMH owns the other 50 percent of the joint venture), which the financial outlet claims is “conservatively” worth approximately $2.8 billion.

Speaking to the success of the Fenty Beauty venture, Forbes states that in its first full calendar year in 2018, the brand “was bringing in more than $550 million in annual revenues, according to LVMH,” enabling it to “beat out other celebrity-founded brands like Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics, Kim Kardashian West’s KKW Beauty and Jessica Alba’s Honest Co.” In its full year report for 2018, LVMH name-checked the beauty brand as “enjoying exceptional success.” Fast forward two years, and LVMH revealed that the brand was continuing to perform well, with the Fenty Skin sub-brand, which got its start in 2020, off to “very promising start” and “generat[ing] unprecedented buzz,” and Fenty Beauty brand, itself, “maintain[ing] its appeal as a premier makeup brand.”

The impending launch of Rihanna’s first Fenty fragrance, which will drop on the Fenty Beauty e-commerce site on August 10, is expected to drive numbers up even further.

“Much of the rest [of Rihanna’s net worth] lies in her stake in Savage x Fenty,” the lingerie brand that she launched with Techstyle, the retail group that owns Kate Hudson’s Fabletics and ShoeDazzle, to much fanfare in May 2018. The subscription-centric Savage x Fenty – which boasts bras in sizes 32A to 38DD, underwear up to a size 3X, and other lingerie that ranges from extra small to 3X – was valued at $1 billion in February 2021 in connection with a $115 million Series B funding round. Prior to that round, Forbes estimated that Rihanna’s 30 percent stake was worth about $80 million.

And still yet, Rihanna’s income as a singer and an actress rounds out the rest of her net worth.

THE BROAD VIEW: The success of the Fenty empire – and in particular, the Fenty Beauty brand – comes as no shortage of celebrities have rushed to get in on the $500 billion global beauty segment by developing and marketing products to their sizable bases of devoted fans. Celebs, such as Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Jennifer Lopez, and Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown, among others, have increasingly gravitated towards to cosmetics and skincare space, and in the process, are readily going beyond the traditional licensed fragrance model that long-served as the standard for famous faces to boost their bottom lines in the consumer products space.

This larger trend also comes as savvy celebs – armed with tens (if not hundreds of) millions of social media followers – and their management teams have been looking to rethink the structure and strategy behind such ventures, distancing themselves from the largely one-dimensional deals of the past, which saw famous figures paid to appear on packaging and in ad campaigns for licensed fragrances under their names, and moving towards more hands-on and potentially lucrative arrangements with equity and/or profit-sharing elements in place."

The move signals continued growth for the second-hand watch market, a growth that has proven to be much faster than the new premium watch space.

Expectations were high last week that the four major spirits producers announcing results – Diageo, LVMH, Campari and Becle – would please investors. They duly did so, all beating market forecasts.

Diageo, LVMH and Davide Campari Milano all ended July with their shares at record highs. Becle, the parent company of the Jose Cuervo range of Tequilas, saw its shares rise by almost 4% in the week but they remain marginally below their June peak.

While LVMH’s stunning 53% growth in organic revenue in the first six months of this year was driven largely by the dominant fashion and leather goods division, the Moët Hennessy wine and spirits arm, achieved sales 56% up on the coronavirus-crippled 2020.

Much more significantly, they were 14% ahead of the same six months in 2019, before the pandemic struck. Diageo’s organic net sales rose 16% for the year ending 30 June, beating the 13.7% rise analysts had expected.

They were 6% above the level Diageo achieved in its fiscal year to June 2019, suggesting the biggest high-end spirits producer is firmly back on track to increase its annual growth at a rate in the high single digits.

Campari also had a bumper first half in 2021 with sales growing by 37.1%. They were 22.3% above the level achieved in the same period two years ago.

Diageo increased its dividend, as it has done without fail since the company was formed by merging Grand Metropolitan and Guinness in 1997, while Campari reminded investors that it has increased their total returns 15-fold over the past 20 years. LVMH shareholders can expect a handsome dividend when it is announced.

Becle’s performance in the three months since Easter drew fewer headlines but at 9.7% above last year’s level its sales were impressive. It was between April and June last year that much of the shutdown took place in the key North American market and Jose Cuervo’s sales boomed as demand for tequila was fuelled by the switch to home consumption.

Despite boards issuing the obligatory warnings that Covid could strike again, these figures point to one conclusion; that the major players in the drinks sector, distillers in particular, are coming through the crisis stronger and healthier than 18 months ago.

Free cash flow growth and the strengthening of balance sheets point to future acquisitions. Diageo’s Ivan Menezes said “we are restless and hungry” with “a lot of opportunities to do better”.

Despite being the world’s biggest premium drinks producer, Diageo accounts for just 1.6% of the global volume sales in the Total Beverage Alcohol sector and 4.1% by value.

Menezes said he had no particular niche to fill in his portfolio, being more interested the quality of any brand and the extra scope it created for the group.

LVMH’s finance chief said that the French group was in a period of consolidation following the US$100 billion-plus takeover of Tiffany in the New Year period. But that has not prevented it bolting on to Moët Hennessy a 50% stake in Armand de Brignac Champagne plus filling a plethora of niches in other divisions.

Campari’s chief executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz said the Italian company was “firing on all of our cylinders” and hinted that opportunities could occur as smaller producers struggled to recover from the financial effects of the pandemic.

Over the past 18 months companies have been forced to focus in even greater detail on costs. Marketing and advertising budgets have been rigidly controlled and targeted with much greater precision than previously, aided by deeper data mining of consumer activity.

The on-trade in North America and much of Europe has reopened and is experiencing what Kunze-Concewitz calls a “revenge hospitality” boom as consumers go out to enjoy themselves in a spending spree.

How far will the pre-Covid balance with the booming off-sector redress itself? All are waiting to see. But all are sure that e-commerce, whether business to business or business to consumer, will continue to grow rapidly.

Menezes says: “By increasing the visibility and ease of purchase for our brands online, we have driven strong performance with some of our largest e-commerce customers.”

Diageo heads spirits retail sales on Amazon in Europe and on Drizly in the US. It tops the small but growing share of online whisky sales in China via Tmall. Yet the e-commerce route accounts for only 5% of the company’s business.

“As well as building on our partnerships with e-retailers and traditional trade channels, we are developing our own e-commerce channels”, says Menezes. Diageo launched nine new sites in the past 12 months, bringing its total to 28, with more to come.

One of the biggest moves in this field is Campari’s link with LVMH following its takeover last year of the Italian online specialist drinks retailer Tannico.

“We’ve gotten together with our friends at Moët Hennessy, and we’ve pooled our stake in Tannico, into a joint venture with them, which is 50-50,” says Kunze-Concewitz .

“This makes two strong and complementary players, obviously there to support the growth of Tannico, which already started by making an important acquisition in France, but this will not be the last one.

“Our agreement is to have a JV which is focused on Europe. There’s plenty to do in a very, very fragmented marketplace, it’s exciting. There’s a great management team at Tannico which, with the support of MH and ourselves, I think, has great opportunities ahead.”"

This isn't the first time Arnault has led the list of the world's wealthiest people.

In December 2019, January 2020, May 2021, and July 2021, he reached number one.

Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Tiffany & Co., Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, R.M Williams, EDUN, Moynat, and Donna Karen are all part of Bernard Arnault's LVMH empire, which also includes TAG Heuer, De Beers, and Bulgari.

Arnault owns a 96.5 per cent stake in Christian Dior, which controls 41 per cent of LVMH.

According to the Bloomberg, he had spent $538 million buying shares of the world's largest luxury goods company in recent months.

The stock was purchased by the CEO through firms that he and his family own.

In Asia and the United States, the premium brand has been posting pre-pandemic sales figures.

Tourists flock to LVMH's home market in Europe for its prized handbags and booze.

Furthermore, as China's economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, LVMH's sales are surging.

On the other hand, when Amazon's stock price plunged 7% last week after the firm reported second-quarter growth that fell short of expectations, Jeff Bezos' net worth plummeted $13.9 billion in a single day.

The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list of the world's wealthiest people is as follows:

The news was announced in a video interview with Beyoncé by Harpers Bazaar this week.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z are the new faces of iconic jewellery brand Tiffany & Co

LVMH has been updating Tiffany’s marketing, stepping away from its signature blue brand image to give it a more edgy, modern look.

This is evidenced in its new ad campaigns, plastered around New York and Los Angeles, titled: “Not your mother’s Tiffany.” Dressed down models in jeans and tank tops stand against a white background wearing items from its jewellery collection. The campaign feels more like American Apparel than anything you would expect from Tiffany’s before.

According to Business of Fashion, citing comments on social media, this campaign has angered some shoppers who say that the new is look is alienating the most loyal fans who remember it best for its Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffany’s days . But some analysts feel differently.

“I think making Tiffany more in sync with the times is a smart move,” said Bernstein senior research analyst Luca Solca. “We were counting that LVMH would know how to inject more content into Tiffany’s marketing, so that the brand could be more relevant to consumers. I don’t believe brands that go through this evolution risk alienating their core audiences – look at Gucci , for example.”

Tiffany’s has been trying to shake off its “fusty … old-fashioned” image long before it was acquired by LVMH but these efforts were blown off course by the pandemic, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

“Now that society is, hopefully, opening back up, Tiffany needs to drive awareness and trade,” he said. “This is quite difficult to do with younger groups as while they respond to marketing, they are fickle and will shop around. And there are plenty of younger, aspirational jewellery brands to snag their custom.”

The massive success of LVMH Moët Hennessy in Asia, specifically China, bumped up LVMH’s valuation to €329 billion in 2021, making it the most valuable company in Europe. Together with his family, Arnault is currently worth $220.9 billion.

Who Is Bernard Arnault?

The LVMH chairman and CEO has been overseeing his luxury goods empire since its inception in 1987 when the then 30-something Arnault decided to build a luxury conglomerate, the first of its kind. The Frenchman was no self-made, rags-to-richest product. Arnault was born into privilege as the son of a French manufacturer with a small fortune in construction. Arnault used his inheritance to begin his aggressive acquisition spree to fulfill LVMH’s ambitious goal to be the biggest luxury goods company in the world.

The king of acquisitions, Arnault started with Christian Dior’s mother company Boussac Saint Feres in 1985, and went on to acquire Celine, Berluti, Kenzo, Guerlain, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, and more in the ‘90s. Moving into the 2000s, LVMH and Arnault fixed their eyes on Emilio Pucci, Fendi, DKNY, and La Samaritaine. His most notable deals in the 2010s were with Bulgari, Stella McCartney House, and Fenty Beauty. Their most recent headline-making acquisition was Tiffany & Co. For a whopping $15.8 billion, largely believed to be the biggest luxury acquisition to date.

With over 70 brands in his empire of luxury goods, fashion, cosmetics, jewelry, wines, and spirits, it’s no wonder Arnault is called the “ultimate taste-maker.” Despite being a ruthless businessman with aggressive strategies, Arnault and LVMH are known for being France’s biggest patrons of the arts. Arnault has spoken more than once about the importance of appreciating creatives.

I’m lucky in that I can say, ‘I want my group to be in such and such a situation in 10 or 20 years’ time’ and then formulate a plan to make that happen.”

“What we do in our group is the opposite of the bad effects of globalization. We produce in Italy and in France and we sell to China, when usually it’s the opposite.”

""China is clearly going to be the number one economic power and it is already full of potential.. with lots of population and the buying power increasing by the day.”"

Who is the world’s richest man, and what does that have to do with Beyoncé? As of the beginning of August, the world’s richest man was not Jeff Bezos but Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury conglomerate LVMH. Yesterday it was revealed that Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a new partnership with Tiffany & Co. Last year, after a contentious takeover process, LVMH acquired Tiffany – it’s the “largest deal in the luxury space”.

Tiffany & Co is one of the world’s most recognisable brands, and up until recently, Tiffany’s whole vibe was Audrey Hepburn styles; it’s a very specific look and energy – a white look and energy, a look that’s become pretty flat, with the Wall Street Journal describing it a few years ago as a brand “with a midlife crisis”. So, as I wrote yesterday, the fact that the Carters are now repping Tiffany signifies the brand’s shift, a big swing to modernise the brand, make it once again culturally relevant. And all of this happening under the leadership of Alexandre Arnault, Bernard’s third child. Who is 29 years old.

Alexandre took over at Tiffany in January and his appointment, according to industry analysts, signalled what a major priority Tiffany’s rebrand is for Bernard and the LVMH empire. But also, perhaps, a test. Because while there is no indication that Bernard intends to step down, he’s 72 years old, he has a reputation for being aggressive and ruthless in business, he has not decided on a successor…and “four of his children are in an unspoken competition” to claim his throne.

Sound familiar? Like Waystar Royco familiar?

The middle child of the Arnault family, Alexandre Arnault, is now trying to prove himself as an executive at @TiffanyAndCo.



Here's how well prepared he is to prove he can inherit his father's luxury empire, LVMH.ðŸ‘‡https://t.co/Z9OI9sapF4 — Business Insider (@BusinessInsider) July 21, 2021

This is Succession, but non-fiction. With real billionaires and not pretend billionaires trying to become a political dynasty.

As for the Carters and Alexandre, was this the first sign that something was happening?

Arnault's net worth rose by $482 million and currently stands at a jaw-dropping $199.2 billion. His net worth in April 2021 was $150 billion.

The 72-year old French billionaire heads the world’s leading fashion brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) which oversees an empire of 70 brands. These brands include Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo, Stella McCartney Fendi, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Sephora.

LVMH completed an acquisition deal with the American jewellery brand Tiffany & Co for $15.8 billion in January 2021, reported to be the biggest brand acquisition ever. It also spent $3.2 billion in 2019 for luxury hospitality group Belmond, which owns or manages 46 hotels, river cruises, and trains.

The crossing received a makeover to mark Qixi Festival, or Chinese Valentine's Day, which falls on Saturday. [CHEN ZHONGQIU/FOR CHINA DAILY]

Foreign firms pin hopes on market as consumer confidence recovers

With the approach of Qixi Festival, Chinese Valentine's Day, on Saturday, international luxury brands are launching limited editions of products featuring heart shapes and the color red to attract more Chinese consumers and make further inroads in China with localization strategies.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic has been brought under better control in China, and with international travel stagnating, China's domestic luxury market has rapidly rebounded and presented global companies huge business opportunities.

In the first half of this year, French luxury group LVMH, the owner of such brands as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine and Fendi, saw its revenue increase 53 percent year-on-year, its earnings report said.

The group attributed the growth to strong performance in its fashion and leather goods divisions, and hard luxury sector－which includes goods such as jewelry and watches. Asia, and especially China, continues to drive LVMH's major growth, accounting for nearly 40 percent of its revenue, it said.

""China's luxury market has grown rapidly, and Chinese consumers have become the main force in global luxury consumption. They serve as an important group to drive further growth of the global luxury market,"" said Zhang Weilin, an analyst at Lead-Leo Research Institute, a market research provider.

A group of luxury brands, including watch retailers Vacheron Constantin and IWC Schaffhausen, introduced more than 500 styles of new products in limited editions for Qixi Festival on Tmall, an Alibaba Group e-commerce platform.

Italian luxury brand Bottega Veneta launched a special edition of its wool handbag for the festival and first released it through a mini-program on WeChat. Louis Vuitton, Valentino, Dior and Gucci all rolled out related products with red hearts and love characters for the festival.

Tmall has become a major online site for global luxury brands to launch new styles in China. Last year, sales of high-end watches on Tmall surged more than 200 percent year-on-year, according to Tmall.

""Luxury brands are making more efforts in strengthening communications with China. Qixi, a festival that is unique to China, has naturally become a good opportunity for luxury brands to boost holiday sales,"" Zhang said.

""Launching limited editions of new styles ahead of Qixi can help brands better promote their products by leveraging the festival atmosphere and generating discussions on social media. Limited editions for holidays can also draw more young consumers to make a purchase through hunger marketing,"" she said.

Hunger marketing is a strategy that aims to generate a strong desire in consumers to buy items that other people also want.

During Spring Festival, China's Lunar New Year holiday, luxury brands usually launch products that feature the Chinese Zodiac and color red, and they tend to release derivative products such as red envelopes.

Consumer confidence on the Chinese mainland has recovered to the pre-pandemic level, according to a report released in June by global public relations firm Ruder Finn and Consumer Research Group.

The report surveyed 1,500 consumers from the Chinese mainland. Forty-one percent said they would consider increasing their spending on luxury products this year, especially in categories like cosmetics, clothing and shoes.

More respondents said that they have been buying more high-quality products since COVID-19 appeared because they want to treat themselves. They have started using online channels to buy luxury items, the report said.

Fueled by the favorable duty-free shopping policies, Sanya, in Hainan province, now ranks No 5 among Chinese mainland cities for luxury shopping. It follows Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Guangdong province.

""Hainan is ideally placed to absorb Chinese luxury duty-free demand. Even after Chinese borders start reopening to leisure travel, Hainan is likely to play an increasingly significant role in drawing Chinese luxury spending,"" said Aimee Kim, a senior partner at the McKinsey& Co consultancy.

""With Hainan scheduled to become a fully duty-free island province by 2025 and growing fast to take a significant share of China's luxury market, it is imperative that luxury brands formulate a strategy to enter, operate, and scale in the market,"" she said."

These conservative business practices almost killed the Swiss watch industry in the 1970s when Japanese watches began to dominate the global market, but things might be starting to slowly shift. In a landmark deal, the online watch marketplace Chrono24 has received a $1 billion (AU$1.3 billion) valuation after securing $116 million (AU$160 million) of funding – some of which has come from LVMH-backed, Aglaé Ventures.

The Series C fundraising round was led by private equity giant General Atlantic with Aglaé Ventures, which is backed by the controlling shareholder of LVMH, Groupe Arnault. This builds on Chrono24’s €37 million Series A funding round from Insight Partners in 2015 and the Series B round of €43 million from Sprints Capital in 2019.

The $1.3 billion company valuation of Chrono24 makes it the first billion-dollar technology disruptor in the watch industry. This is thanks to the incredible growth of the preowned watch market, which barely existed at scale a decade ago.

According to reports, Chrono24 receives more than 500,000 unique visitors every day, hosts more than 30,000 private sellers, 3,000 dealers, and has around half a million watches listed for sale at any given moment. Impressive numbers, especially in an environment where the second-hand watch market is expected to hit nearly $40 billion by 2025.

“Once again, Chrono24 has been able to win premier growth-experienced partners like General Atlantic and Aglaé Ventures,” said Chrono24 Co-CEO, Tim Stracke.

“As originators of the digital marketplace concept within the luxury watch world, we’ve built a platform that not only supports and encourages evolving consumer behaviour, but also provides invaluable proof of concept to an industry that has traditionally shied away from disruption.”

“We are very pleased that General Atlantic and Aglaé Ventures recognise the vast market potential lying in the digital evolution of luxury retail and our company’s role in this industry.”

While this is a significant moment in the history of Chrono24, it also marks an important moment for the watch industry at large. The involvement of Aglaé Ventures effectively sees LVMH buying a part of one of the world’s largest grey market businesses, where brand new watches are sold outside of authorised channels.

Is this simply the tactic of backing all horses when you’re unsure of the winner? Perhaps… but the latest valuation and round of funding will see Chrono24 enter into the LVMH orbit, and further their position as the dominant marketplace player."

Although Swatch, Richemont and LVMH are the most prominent luxury conglomerates, controlling multiple prestigious brands, the watch industry has other important players worth being aware of.

Some might own only a couple of notable watchmakers alongside brands in other segments, while others like Citizen rival the Swiss big boys in scope and importance. Understanding them and how certain brands are related can help make sense of the larger watch industry and put your favorite products into perspective. Don’t be surprised if you find some brands below you didn’t know had a common boss.

The Citizen name means much more than inexpensive solar-powered watches, and the Citizen Group is unusual in a few ways. It owns more watchmakers than LVMH, and it’s the only Japanese brand that’s proactively taken this approach to expansion. In addition to its own Citizen-branded watches and the prolific movement maker Miyota, it controls once-American brands Bulova and Accutron, as well as some Swiss luxury watchmakers with significant knowhow and production capacity.

Frederique Constant, Alpina and Ateliers de Monaco are all related parts of a Swiss group that joined Citizen in 2016. High-end watchmakers Arnold & Son and Angelus are, similarly, sister brands under Citizen since 2012.

According to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, Arnault had a net worth of $199.1 billion on Thursday. Meanwhile, Bezos' real-time net worth stood at $193.8 billion, while that of Musk was $184.7 billion.



LVMH

Arnault, 72, is one of the leading authorities in fashion around the world. The billionaire runs LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world leader in luxury goods. The company oversees 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Moët, Fendi, Christian Dior, Givenchy and Sephora.

The group's reported 10-fold increase on annual basis in its bottom-line net profit soared at 5.3 billion euros ($6.3 billion) between January and June this year.

His net worth took a giant leap after LVMH completed a deal with American jeweller Tiffany & Co in January 2021 for $15.8 billion, which is believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever.



In 2019, LVMH completed the acquisition of luxury hospitality group Belmond, which owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants, trains and river cruises.



Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos' net worth suffered a hit last week as Amazon shares fell after reporting second quarter earnings.

Both billionaires went back and forth for the top spot on the Forbes rich list between May and June.

According to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List, the French business tycoon's net worth was recorded at $198.9 billion. Keep in mind that the Forbes list is dynamic and can change at any given time since it is based on real-time.

This is not Arnault's first time being number one, he has been declared as the richest man quite a few times before as well in December 2019, January 2020, May 2021, and July 2021.

Arnault recently overtook Elon Musk, owner of Space X and Tesla in its first quarter with a revenue of €14 billion in 2021. Recently, he also spent $538 million dollars to acquire the shares of his own French label.

Arnault looks after a consortium of 70 brands including Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Tiffany & Co, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Christian Dior and Givenchy. His four out of five children help him manage his empire - Frédéric, Delphine, Antoine and Alexandre.

In January 2021, LVMH acquired America’s largest jewellery maker Tiffany & Co. for USD 15.8 million.

LVMH's Trent Fraser comes home to join Top Shelf International - Drinks Trade,"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyaW5rc3RyYWRlLmNvbS5hdS9sdm1ocy10cmVudC1mcmFzZXItY29tZXMtaG9tZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Trent Fraser has left LMVH and will return to Australia to lead Top Shelf International’s (TSI) Australian Agave project and international expansion.

Mr Fraser joins the team with more than two decades of experience in wine and spirits, including the last 13 years spent in New York with Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH).

Adelaide born and bred, Mr Fraser spent close to a decade working with Penfolds and Treasury Wine Estates in Australia. In 2008 he took up a position in New York with Moët Hennessy within its luxury spirits portfolio, where he spent nine years as Vice President for the iconic Champagne producer, Dom Perignon.

Staying within the Moët Hennessy wine and spirits family, Mr Fraser was then appointed to build and launch a new international tequila brand, Volcan De Mi Tierra which he built from the ground up over a six-year period, guiding the strategy, branding, route-to-market and overall sales and marketing initiatives, as well as taking a hands-on approach to the establishment of the farming, harvesting and distillation side of the business.

Today it is one of one of most respected Tequila brands in the world and well on its way to becoming a top five player in its category.

TSI CEO Drew Fairchild says that this experience makes him the perfect candidate to develop and rollout TSI’s Australian agave spirit production.

“We could not have found a more well-credentialled, internationally-recognised Australian in the spirits world to help TSI realise its ambition to become Australia’s first globally relevant multi-branded spirits company.

“We’re thrilled he shares our vision and passion to create not only Australia’s first agave spirit of global relevance, but also to help guide our spirits portfolio’s entry into markets around the world.”

Trent Fraser said, “I’m a very proud Aussie and the opportunity to return home to lead something so ground-breaking is undeniably the main driving motivation, as is the rule-breaking, hungry and pioneering attitude of the TSI team. I’m honoured to be part of this amazing team and company.

“Before accepting this role and major life change I obviously needed to test and trial if this concept could work. The team sent to me some of its early experimental liquid and I was immediately impressed. A stunning Agave liquid profile that has been carefully nurtured to flourish outside of its native Mexico will be the next chapter in Agave’s future.”

Mr Fraser relished his experience at LVMH, particularly his work in building the Volcan De Mi Tierra brand from constructing the distillery in Guadalajara to drilling for water, being head down in the intricacies of IP and contractual law to working across diverse customs and cultures.

“The branding and bottle design won numerous awards and we launched into market in 2017 with many accolades and medals in top wines and spirits shows. Today I’m proud to leave behind a legacy of one of the most respected Tequila brands in the world.

“I’ve never been more fired up in my life to apply my agave and international spirits knowledge and learnings to create the best Australian Agave to inspire and share with the world.”

Mr Fraser commences his role in September having left LVMH in June. He is currently living in Portgual with his wife where he is working through the challenges of returning home given the current restrictions due to COVID. He will work remotely until he is able to return to Australia."
The Dark Truth About Louis Vuitton's Bernard Arnault - Grunge,"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdydW5nZS5jb20vNDg1OTU2L3RoZS1kYXJrLXRydXRoLWFib3V0LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b25zLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Dark Truth About Louis Vuitton's Bernard Arnault

There are two ways people tend to view billionaires, and it really comes down to what part of their lives you're looking at. It's difficult to amass that much of the world's wealth while being an all-around good guy; some might even assume it's impossible. It's all about perspective. So, if you look at their business dealings and what products or services their companies have brought to the table, you might think they're intelligent, business savvy individuals.

Then again, if you look at how they got to that level through the corners they cut — there's a good chance they cut corners — and the people they've taken advantage of, you might just think they're supervillains, or at least not-so-cool individuals. This is what the ""dark truth"" of these billionaires is all about, and LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault didn't get to where he was by being the best guy on the block.

There always has to be one richest man in the world, and for a while now, that's been Jeff Bezos, but Arnault keeps periodically stealing the No. 1 slot away from the Amazon billionaire. Forbes points out that Arnault was about $500 million ahead of Bezos at the end of July 2021. He probably won't stay in that position, since he's bounced up there a few times. But whether he's first or second richest man in the world, there's a dark truth behind his wealth and the company that made him that rich in the first place."

How The Fashion Industry Made Bernard Arnault World's Richest Man - - HOLR Magazine,"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vaG9scm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beating Jeff Bezos on the number 1 spot for the World’s Richest Man, Bernard Arnault jumps back to the spot with a net worth of $199.9B.

According to Forbes, Arnault beat Bezos when Amazon stocks went down by 7.6%, making Bezos lose $13.9B while the French tycoon lost $2.9B but still managed to be ahead of Bezos. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton currently carries 75 brands and subsidiaries and 17 of which are luxury fashion brands like Celine, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, and Loewe.

So how exactly did this luxury giant becomes the world’s richest man?

Bernard Jean Arnault, born in Roubaix, France was a son of a manufacturer and the civil engineering company Ferret-Savinel. Having graduated from École Polytechnique— France’s leading engineering school– he started working for his father’s company. Soon, he convinced his father to divert the company’s focus on real estate. The young Arnault became Ferret-Savinel’s president from 1978-1984.

In 1983, Boussac Saint-Frères declared bankruptcy. Boussac is a textile and retail giant which owned a number of department stores and luxury goods including Christian Dior. The French government was looking for someone to save the textile empire and Arnault was eager to acquire Dior so with the help of his family’s fortune and the French financial institution, Lazard Frères, he purchased Boussac.

Within 2 years of obtaining the company, he laid off 9,000 workers and sold most of the company’s assets with the exemption of Christian Dior and Le Bon Marché department store. Within those 2 years, the company was profitable again.

Becoming LVMH’s largest stakeholder

It did not take long for Arnault to build his dream luxury group. In 1987, Louis Vuitton, Moët et Chandon, and Hennessy merged to form the LVMH Group. The man dubbed as the “wolf in cashmere” sought to oust Louis Vuitton’s chairman, Henry Racamier by buying the majority of the shares while Racamier was in the middle of a business feud with LVMH’s then-chairman, Alain Chevalier. Racamier eventually resigned and Arnault was unanimously elected as LVMH’s new chairman.

Since then, the business tycoon expanded LVMH’s reach by acquiring luxury brands varying from haute couture houses to jewelry, beauty products, and even yachts. Their recent transactions included buying Tiffany & Co. (but for a reduced price), taking 60% of shares from Virgil Abloh’s brand, Off-White, and taking a minority stake at Phoebe Philo’s upcoming new label.

Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, surpassed the Amazon founder after Bezos’ net worth fell $13.9 billion in a day. According to CNBC, Arnault’s current worth is $195.8 billion as of Monday, whereas Bezos’ stood at $192.6 billion.

Apart from being the CEO of Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, better known as LVMH, Arnault is also an investor, and art collector. He owns a 47.5% share at LVMH, which has a market capitalization of $400 billion. Companies like Fendi, Givenchy, and Christian Dior, are also owned by LVMH.

While other sectors have suffered during the pandemic, LVMH recorded pre-pandemic sales figures in Asia, and the United States, with a rise in Chinese sales, due to the country’s economy coming out of the COVID-19 induced lull. Arnault gained considerable profit during the pandemic, with the French tycoon’s wealth growing by nearly $100 billion last year. He also owns a 95.6% stake in Christian Dior, which controls 41% of LVMH.

On the other hand, Amazon’s stock went down on Friday, with management expecting the top line to increase just 10%-16% in the third quarter, much lower than the estimated values. The valuation also shows that the pandemic tailwind is over. Amazon shares closed down 7.6%, erasing nearly $120 billion of market value, resulting in Bezos’ demotion as the world’s richest man.

However, the net worth of Jeff Bezos still surpasses that of Elon Musk, the CEO and Chief Engineer of SpaceX and Tesla by $13 billion, making Musk the third richest man on the planet.

Bezos, Arnault, and Musk are all centibillionaires, meaning that each has had a net worth of at least $100 billion. Bernard Arnault is the only non American member of this ultra-wealthy club."
