The iconic yellow Rodeo Drive store sold for $122 million to the parent company of Louis Vuitton, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to CoStar.

That’s a whopping $19,405 per square foot for the 6,287-square-foot store, significantly pricier than Chanel’s storefront down the road, which the fashion house bought for $13,217 per square foot last year.

The seller, according to CoStar, was the Brooks Caddell Barton Trust and Dominium Management. They were represented by HFF’s Bryan Ley, Marc Schillinger, and Bill Fishel.

Properties on Rodeo Drive rarely sell, JLL broker Houman Mahboubi told the L.A. Business Journal last month. That’s why, he said, “the value only goes up.” [LABJ] — Cathaleen Chen"
Grace Wales Bonner's interview for the 2016 LMVH Prize - Numéro Magazine,"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm51bWVyby5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi0wL2ludGVydmlldy1ncmFjZS13YWxlcy1ib25uZXItaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWx2bWgtcHJpemUtMjAxNi1tZW5mYXNoaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"She’s only 25 years old but her maturity is astonishing. Winner of the 2016 LVMH prize, Grace Wales Bonner seduced the prestigious jury - made up of all the group’s artistic directors - with a committed discourse far from the norm. Having graduated from Central Saint Martin’s in 2014, this young Londoner with Jamaican origins conceives her fashion in resonance with a reflection that goes way beyond the image of black men in our western contemporary society. Ever since her first runway show in 2015 as part of the Fashion East program, her menswear collections mix African and European influences with her own artistic work: videos, texts, collages assembled in her magazine entitled Everythings for Real. Numéro caught up with this young woman at the LVMH prize-giving ceremony.

Numéro: Beyond fashion, you’re also an artist. What’s the relationship between your research work and collections?

Grace Wales Bonner: It’s true my world doesn’t stop at fashion. I always start with a broader issue and then I look for how I can translate my ideas. I never close any doors. I concentrate on the way I can translate these references in a final piece. You have to be very precise. In this way I think my artistic work and my collections nourish each other.

Do you see clothing as a social sign?

Absolutely. The more I concentrate on fashion, the more I realise the extent to which clothing is a vector of communication. Getting dressed is an act full of emotion and meaning. I want my clothes to reflect that. What motivates me most is to give a broader vision to black culture, and to open a debate on masculine beauty.

Black culture is poorly represented in fashion, and often treated with clichés. How do you position yourself in relation to that?

Showing black people or dealing with black culture shouldn’t be used as a gadget or a trend. This question has always been crucial to me. I started doing fashion because current representations of black people have no resonance with the reality of my life. I wanted to show an image of beauty, sophistication and dignity that I couldn’t find anywhere else.

I guess there’s no chance of you reifying your models.

Certainly not. I’m very involved with my casting. I talk to my models a lot; I draw inspiration from their feelings when I conceive my clothes. I work with the same people season after season. I highlight the natural allure and the personality of each individual. I want to show the boys of today because they’re the ones that inspire me.

Do your references come from fashion?

Most come from other disciplines. I’m particularly inspired by the painter Kerry James Marshall. He paints black people according to the conventions of classic portraiture emphasising their power, their dignity and beauty. The canvases are commercially successful and they’re big in size so when you hang one in your apartment, it really does occupy the space. Suddenly black people who have been sub-represented take on a dominating dimension. It’s like a subversive strategy and I find that really interesting.

What importance do you give the beauty of your clothes that combine African and European influences?

I place great importance on the making and the quality of the pieces. When you’re a young designer you have to work hard at persuading factories and craftsmen to join you. So I really sought out people who believed in my project and wanted to support it. With this prize I’ve just won, I’ll be able to improve the quality of my pieces and explore so many more possibilities.

The sale occurred last month.

On a price per square foot level, the deal by LVMH trumps the price luxury retailer Chanel paid last year for a neighboring building on Rodeo drive. The Paris-based conglomerate paid more than $19,000 a square foot compared with the $13,000 paid by Chanel.

The 6,200-square-foot space may be passing from one luxury retailer to another but it is still a changing of the guard. Bijan had occupied that space for 40 years.

Holliday Fenoglio Fowler’s Bryan Ley, Marc Schillinger, and Bill Fishel represented the sellers, confirmed via CoStar as the Brooks Caddell Barton Trust and Dominium Management Corp. When reached by phone an LVMH representative declined to comment.

224-Year-Old Goyard Seduces Luxury Giants | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9nb3lhcmQtbHVnZ2FnZS1tYWtlci1mb3ItdGhlLXRydWx5LXJpY2gtc2VkdWNlcy1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Only the really wealthy know Goyard.

Unlike Gucci or Louis Vuitton, the more than 200-year-old Parisian maker of luxury luggage and bags — with one of its 19th-century-style trunks going for €52,380 ($59,315) — maintains a studied silence. It does not advertise in glossy magazines, and is among the last of its kind not swallowed up by a larger peer. So far, that is.

Kering chief executive officer Francois-Henri Pinault would not be averse to adding it to his company's stable of brands, a person familiar with the matter said. While neither Kering nor its larger rival LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton will officially comment on whether they are interested in Goyard, industry observers say it is unlikely they would pass up a chance to consider buying it.

""In the event that Goyard is for sale, LVMH and Kering will surely take a look,"" said Mario Ortelli, London-based head of luxury at Sanford C. Bernstein. ""The Goyard brand would be compatible with Kering’s portfolio, for example, or LVMH could seek to increase its market share in leather goods rather than let another company build up a competitor to its brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Céline.""

ADVERTISEMENT

Businessman Jean-Michel Signoles, who bought Goyard in 1998 from its founding family, will not say if he wants to sell the company he turned around by expanding sales to the new, burgeoning wave of the world’s wealthy.

Aristocrats’ Bags

Luggage maker of aristocrats in the 19th and 20th centuries, Goyard counted the Maharaja of Kapurthala, the Rockefellers, the Romanovs, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Karl Lagerfeld among its customers, it says on its website. The company, which boasts a ""complete disregard for marketing or mass-production,"" also says it doesn't engage ""in any form of e-commerce."" It declined to respond to Bloomberg's questions.

A visit to Goyard’s flagship Paris store on rue Saint-Honore, across from Louis Vuitton and Moynat outlets, is a journey into the past, with trunks hearkening back to a bygone era. The shop also features an array of cases and duffle bags ranging from less than €3,000 to close to €6,000, as well as tote bags from €1,560 and a red crocodile-skin number for €37,000. Beach bags, towels, pouches, wallets, hangers, belts, dog collars, slippers, umbrellas, pens and pen cases complete the collection.

On a recent day, customers had to wait outside the shop because it could only accommodate a limited number of clients. Assistants in white gloves attended to the shoppers fortunate enough to have entered.

""Goyard has evolved from a very functional brand, and while it remains very classic, it’s technically and aesthetically appealing to people, with its hand-painted initials, seals and images,"" said Dana Telsey, founder of Telsey Advisory Group in New York.

Burgundy Touch

The company traces its history back to 1792 when it was founded in Paris by Pierre-Francois Martin as a maker of cases and boxes to transport fragile objects. Childless, Martin passed his company on to one of his workers, Louis-Henri Morel, who hired 17-year-old Francois Goyard in 1845. Goyard took over the company after Morel’s death.

In 1885, the business was taken over by Francois’s son Edmond, who came up with the company’s emblematic Goyardine canvass, a soft and waterproof mixture of linen and cotton inspired by the clothes worn by the family’s water log drivers and their community in the village of Clamecy in Burgundy. The business was then handed down from father to son until it was bought by Signoles, who brought his own sons Alex and Remi on board.

Raking in Profits

For all its claims to ""timeless elegance, craftsmanship and exclusivity,"" Goyard was accumulating losses when it was taken over by Signoles, the founder of children’s clothes brand Chipie. Signoles pumped in capital, refurbished the Saint-Honore store and opened outlets in Asia and North America as well as a couple in Europe and one in Sao Paulo.

""The fact that it’s no longer family-owned, that it’s gained a better-known name, expanded its leather goods assortment and opened new stores, like the one on Madison Avenue in New York, that already says that the brand is aiming for greater reach,"" said Telsey.

The strategy has paid off, regulatory filings with Paris’s Commercial Court show. Revenue surged to €41.1 million in 2013, the latest available data on the company, from €1.14 million in 2000. Profit rose to €12.8 million from €18,000 as exports accounted for a third of sales from less than 4 percent.

Brilliant Job

""Signoles has done a brilliant job of maintaining the brand heritage while growing it slowly,"" said Milton Pedraza, chief executive officer of the Luxury Institute, in New York.

Still, to be all that it can be, Goyard may need some help, he said.

ADVERTISEMENT

""To reach a critical mass where it can survive and thrive on a larger scale, while remaining unique and exclusive, it will need the larger capital and know-how that larger groups can provide, as happened for Bottega Veneta with Kering, or Vuitton with LVMH,"" Pedraza said.

5 mind blowing facts about Louis Vuitton - Luxurylaunches,"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmctZmFjdHMtb24tbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

There’s a lot we know and love about Louis Vuitton! They make excellent luggage and handbags, they’ve just launched a series of perfumes, and they even recently changed their packaging. But there’s still a lot to be learned about this luxury goods giant. We’ve rounded up some surprising facts that even the most committed LV fans might never have come across before, from beautiful store spaces to a brand value that’s unsurpassed by any competitors and from the power of the luxury conglomerate to some unexpected products, we’re taking you inside the world of LV like never before. In fact, though this brand always takes pride in its heritage, it may even have a skeleton or two in its spacious closet! We’ve talked about some interesting Louis Vuitton facts before here on LuxuryLaunches and you can consider this the much awaited sequel to our story. Some of these facts will surprise even longtime LV devotees!





Its brand value surpasses Gucci, Hermes and a lot more

Louis Vuitton placed 19th on Forbes’ 2016 ranking of most valuable brands. It is the only luxury fashion brand to make it to the top thirty (Nike was the closest possible competitor at Number 18 while Gucci lagged at 44) and is followed by Mercedes Benz. The Louis Vuitton brand is worth an astonishing $27.3 billion which is more than Hermes ($11.7 billion) and Gucci ($12 billion) combined! Even the fast fashion brands H&M ($15.9 billion) and Zara ($10.7 billion) couldn’t measure up to Louis Vuitton’s awesome lead. We knew that monogram was powerful, but even we didn’t even anticipate a value of several billion dollars!



Their parent company literally controls the luxury market

Louis Vuitton is part of the LVHM conglomerate which owns almost all the major luxury brands seen in the market today. Subsidiaries of LVHM include Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Emilio Pucci even Dior and Celine. Among watches and jewelry, the conglomerate owns Hublot, Tag Heuer, Zenith and Bulgari. Dom Pérignon, Domaine Chandon California, Hennessy, Glenmorangie, Krug, Mercier and Moët & Chandon are some of the wine and spirits companies that are owned by LVHM. This conglomerate which is managed by Bernard Arnault is sometimes thought to have a monopoly over the luxury good sector. Imagine you’re wearing Fendi shoes and a Pucci dress, your makeup is from Sephora and you’re sporting jewelry from Bulgari as you sip Moët from a fluted glass. Suddenly you’re in head to toe LVHM without even realising it! Given these facts Arnault could easily be one of the most powerful men in the industry since every move he makes on behalf of the conglomerate could have incredibly far reaching consequences.



Louis Vuitton’s grandson Henri was allegedly a Nazi supporter!

In 2004, a book called Louis Vuitton, A French Saga exposed ties between the Vuitton family and the German Nazis. Author Stephanie Bonvicini reveals that she stumbled across the information when she was researching story of Louis Vuitton for a story on the brand’s 150th anniversary. When she approached the brand for information about its wartime activities, they clammed up and claimed that documents from 1930 to 1945 had been destroyed in a fire. However, historical archives revealed that Louis Vuitton’s store at the Hotel du Parc, in Vichy where Pétain set up his puppet government, was the only store allowed to operate while others were shut down. The author even states that Henry Vuitton, great-grandson of the firm’s founder Louis, apparently set up a factory making artifacts to glorify Petain including busts of him. A spokesperson for the company responded with the following statement, “We don’t deny the facts. But regrettably the author has exaggerated the Vichy episode.”



Louis Vuitton’s cuddliest creation is a $9,000 limited edition teddy bear

Louis Vuitton only created one teddy bear design on their 150th anniversary that was completely designed, developed and manufactured by their own company. 500 pieces of the monogrammed bear – christened DouDou– were created and each one retailed for a staggering $9000. One of them was even sold at a Christie’s auction in Monaco for a whopping $182,000! Everytime a treasure like this hits the market, Louis Vuitton collectors are front and center trying to snag a piece of the action. And the auctioned off bear is an indication of the demand for limited edition products from luxury goods companies, especially considering it sold for many times the original price. Smart collectors know exactly when to buy and when to sell to make the most profit!



Louis Vuitton’s Singapore Maison has an underwater access tunnel, bookstore and a relaxation deck

Located in a multi-storey building that acts as an island and connected by tunnels to Marina Bay Sands is Louis Vuitton’s Singapore maison. The space was originally intended to be a gallery, but it caught the fancy of Bernard Arnault and after a series of long and complex negotiations, LVHM secured the space for Louis Vuitton. The store opened last September and has already established itself as a Marina Bay Sands landmark. Designed by architect Moshe Safdie, the space is part of the Marina Bay Sands resort, but the nautical interiors by Peter Marino give the store a distinctly Louis Vuitton feel. The timber used in shipbuilding as well as the stone of harbors can be found here. The space has been designed to encourage visitors to look outside the building and enjoy the view but the fantastic display of Louis Vuitton products might steal all your attention. This store retails all the usual LV clothing and accessories that fans love, but as an added bonus this space boasts a dedicated watch room where you can peruse the brand’s timepieces to your heart’s content. Believe it or not, there’s even a deck where you can sit back and relax as you soak up the fabulous views and atmosphere."
LVMH Fund Sells L'Avenue Stake to Angela Leong - Mingtiandi,"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2ZpbmFuY2UvbHZtaC1mdW5kLXNhaWQtdG8taGF2ZS1zb2xkLXN0YWtlLWluLXNoYW5naGFpcy1iaWctYm9vdC10by1hbmdlbGEtbGVvbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L Real Estate, a private equity vehicle controlled by the family behind luxury conglomerate LVMH, has reportedly exited its investment in a Shanghai commercial project after selling out its 50 percent stake to a company controlled by Angela Leong On Kei, a Hong Kong businesswoman and consort of Macau gambling billionaire Stanley Ho.

L’Avenue International Holdings, a privately held holding company controlled by Leong took 100 percent possession of L’Avenue, a 140,000 square metre (GFA) office and retail complex in Shanghai’s Hongqiao area, from the French luxury firm in a previously undisclosed transaction earlier this year, according to accounts in the Shanghai Daily and Forbes Asia.

Leong Names Holding Company After Shanghai Project

L Real Estate had reportedly been trying to dispose of its share of the boot-shaped commercial project since early 2015, only to see the property linger on the market for more than one year, despite record demand for prime assets in first tier Chinese cities, especially in Shanghai.

No price has been announced for the transaction, however, a rumoured sale of the project to Blackstone which was reported last year, put L Real Estate’s asking price at around RMB 5.3 billion ($799 million) at the time.

William Wang, head of L’Avenue International Holdings’ China operations, reportedly confirmed the sale to the Shanghai Daily, as well as acknowledging his company’s status as sole owner of the project on Hongqiao’s Xianxia Road. L’Avenue International was set up by Leong to manage her property portfolio, which also includes more than a dozen buildings in Hong Kong, as well as assets in Beijing, Shanghai and Macau.

Retail Slowdown May Have Hurt Luxury Development

Leong, who is commonly referred to as Ho’s “fourth wife” acquired her 50 percent stake in the 31-storey tower when the assets of the ailing 94-year-old tycoon were divvied up among his family members. Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau (STDM), which is Ho’s primary holding company, set up a 50-50 joint venture with LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault in 2009 to develop the distinctively designed project.

Rather than attracting customers to L’Avenue, however, the projects’s association with LVMH and its stable of luxury brands may have proved a drag on revenues rather than a plus for the suburban project. Retail sales growth slowed to 10.3 percent in China during July, with ecommerce accounting for much of that expansion.

With the Xi Jinping government continuing to crack down on conspicuous consumption and corruption, sales for retailers such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi – all of which anchor L’Avenue – have been particularly disappointing. L’Avenue has 40,000 square metres of retail space in addition to just under 100,000 square metres of office space."
