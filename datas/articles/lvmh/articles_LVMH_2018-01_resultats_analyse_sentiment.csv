LVMH Chief Predicts Huge Hedi Slimane Impact at Céline - WWD,"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtcHJlZGljdHMtY2VsaW5lLXRyaXBsZS1yZXZlbnVlcy1oZWRpLXNsaW1hbmUtMTExMjkyOTcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bernard Arnault is betting big on his latest recruit.

The chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said on Thursday he hopes Hedi Slimane, a “global superstar” designer, will help Céline double or triple its revenues within five years. Slimane is set to join the brand on Feb. 1, and extend its activities into men’s wear, couture and fragrance.

Speaking after LVMH reported record results for 2017, with net profit jumping 29 percent to break the threshold of 5 billion euros, Arnault said sales at Céline are close to 1 billion euros. That places it just behind Fendi as among the group’s most powerful luxury brands. Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior are the top two.

“The objective with him is to reach at least 2 billion to 3 billion euros, and perhaps more, within five years,” Arnault told analysts and reporters gathered at LVMH’s headquarters on Avenue Montaigne here. “Everything is in place for this brand to achieve quite exceptional growth.”

Slimane famously set in motion the skinny tailoring trend during his tenure at Dior Homme from 2000 to 2007. He has been on fashion’s sidelines since April 2016, when he wrapped up a celebrated, and controversial, four-year tenure at Yves Saint Laurent, which he helped propel past 1 billion euros in sales.

Louis Vuitton remained LVMH’s undisputed star brand in 2017, helping to drive sales in the fashion and leather goods division up 13 percent in organic terms to 15.47 billion euros. In the fourth quarter, the segment grew 10 percent, slightly exceeding analysts’ forecasts.

Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury groups equity research at Citi, estimated that Vuitton recorded double-digit sales growth, adding 1 billion euros in revenues last year alone — a figure that Arnault neither confirmed nor denied. LVMH does not break out sales data for individual brands in its fashion division.

“We could have had a much bigger turnover. We didn’t for several reasons: one of them being production capacity, but also the fact that when there is too much demand for a given product, we prefer to ensure diversity. Top-tier products are growing very well right now at Louis Vuitton,” Arnault said.

He singled out high jewelry and exotic leather handbags, and described Vuitton’s collaborations with U.S. artist Jeff Koons and streetwear brand Supreme as very successful, with the latter selling out in two weeks.

In a veiled dig at rival group Kering, which has seen stratospheric growth with its flagship Gucci brand because of creative director Alessandro Michele’s geek-chic aesthetic, Arnault said he preferred Louis Vuitton not to expand too fast.

“Our ambition…is to remain the most desirable brand for the next 10 years and beyond, and for that, you have to be very careful and try to be wary of overly pronounced and divisive trends, which have the disadvantage of weighing on the image. We aim to combine modernity with timelessness,” he said.

The luxury magnate said LVMH has maintained its momentum in January so far, after posting revenues of 42.64 billion euros for all of 2017, up 13 percent over the previous year. Stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations, sales were up 12 percent last year.

The group recorded double-digit growth in every region, except Europe, in the fourth quarter. “I am confident in our business in the medium-term,” Arnault said, noting that living standards were set to continue improving, both in mature and developed economies, ensuring a growing customer base for luxury brands.

Nonetheless, he reiterated his by-now-standard warning that a crisis could hit at any time. “I am personally convinced that we are going to have a crisis sometime in the next five years — I can’t say when,” he said. “That’s why I say that I’m confident for 2018, but you have to be cautious.”

Arnault suggested that a financial markets meltdown could have at least one silver lining: Making potential acquisition targets cheaper.

“Prices are very high, so for mergers and acquisitions, I would wait for the next crisis. Everything collapses, and that’s when it becomes attractive, and in general that is the moment when people no longer want to buy anything,” he said, displaying the business instincts that have made him France’s wealthiest man.

In the meantime, he suggested Louis Vuitton might have to tweak its prices in certain regions to compensate for the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar. A strong euro makes European products more expensive in foreign-currency terms.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, said currency fluctuations shaved 6 percent off group revenues in the fourth quarter. They cost the group 243 million euros in revenues last year, mostly in the second half.

He reported that Marc Jacobs, which is undergoing a lengthy and painful restructuring, is seeing the first signs of improvement. “The work on product is starting to bear fruit,” the executive said, noting an uptick in sales in the U.S. brand’s own stores.

“We are already seeing an improvement in orders. To be clear, we are very far from breaking even, but there is a certain amount of improvement. That is the first time I am saying that,” Guiony added.

Among last year’s notable successes in perfumes and cosmetics was the launch of the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna line. LVMH is a majority owner of the brand through its Kendo division, which was estimated to have paid up to $10 million to make the deal in 2016.

Arnault highlighted the “terrific” success of the cosmetics collection, noting that sales were in the hundreds of millions of euros since the line’s launch in September, and its target for 2018 is equally ambitious.

“We started from scratch, so we didn’t make an investment, and when you see some highly respectable competitors paying more than 1 billion euros for cosmetics brands with revenues of 200 million or 300 million euros, I would just like to highlight the difference in approach compared with our strategy,” he said.

The Rihanna line, together with strong sales at Christian Dior Parfums, helped to propel organic revenues for the perfumes and cosmetics division up 14 percent in the fourth quarter. Watches and jewelry rose 9 percent, buoyed by the strong performance of jeweler Bulgari.

Turnover in selective retailing, the division that includes Sephora, rose 14 percent in organic terms, while wines and spirits posted a 6 percent increase.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9983409643173218}",positive,0.9983409643173218,1
Hedi Slimane Taking the Reins at Céline - The New York Times,"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvMjEvZmFzaGlvbi9oZWRpLXNsaW1hbmUtY2VsaW5lLWx2bWguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hedi Slimane, one of the most successful but also controversial designers of his generation, will be the new artistic, creative and image director of Céline, the luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced on Sunday.

He will control all aspects of the collections and the brand image, including advertising campaigns and store design. He will introduce a men’s collection and work on fragrance as well as fashion and accessories.

The move is a return home of sorts for Mr. Slimane, 49, who began his career at Yves Saint Laurent and was hired by LVMH in 2000 to create Dior Homme, where his pin-thin jeans and sharp tailoring became the stuff of men’s (and some women’s) obsessions. He left Dior Homme in 2007 and returned to Yves Saint Laurent, owned by LVMH’s rival Kering, as creative and image director in 2012.

“I am particularly happy that Hedi is back within the LVMH Group and taking the reins of our Céline maison,” Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH, said in a statement. “He is one of the most talented designers of our time. His arrival at Céline reinforces the great ambitions that LVMH has for this maison. He will leverage his global vision and unique aesthetic virtuosity in further building an iconic French maison.” (Industry observers still remember Mr. Arnault’s wearing Mr. Slimane’s Dior Homme suits.)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999618530273438}",neutral,0.9999618530273438,0
"LVMH Up 13% Last Year, Bolstered by Bulgari - National Jeweler","Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsamV3ZWxlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNDYwOS1sdm1oLXVwLTEzLWxhc3QteWVhci1ib2xzdGVyZWQtYnktYnVsZ2FyadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

New York--In its recently released year-end report, luxury conglomerate Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) reported a 13 percent year-over-year increase in revenue across all divisions.



Total revenue was 42.6 billion euros, or approximately $52.59 billion per current exchange rates.



LVMH said organic revenue grew 12 percent and each of its divisions grew organically by double digits, with the exception of wines and spirits. Profits increased 18 percent, while operating margin hit 19.5 percent.



In the company’s watches and jewelry division, the strongest-performing brand was Bulgari, which grew considerably across Asia, Europe and the United States.



LVMH attributed the brand’s popularity to iconic lines like Serpenti, B.Zero1, Diva and Octo.



Overall, watches and jewelry saw organic revenue growth of 12 percent, while revenue growth on a reported basis was 10 percent. Profit from recurring operations grew 12 percent.



Chaumet grew due to the success of its Liens and Josephine collections.



In watches, both Hublot and TAG Heuer saw growth, with the latter launching a new generation of customizable smartwatches in the period.



Commenting on the company’s performance as a whole, Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH achieved another record year. The excellent performance, to which all our businesses contributed, is due in part to the buoyant environment but, above all, to the remarkable creative strength of our brands and their ability to constantly reinvent themselves … In an environment that remains uncertain, we can count on the appeal of our brands and the agility of our teams to strengthen, once again in 2018, our leadership in the universe of high-quality products.”



LVMH said it is viewing fiscal year 2018 with “cautious confidence.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Delphine Arnault: The Quiet Force Charting a New Era for LVMH - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2RlbHBoaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtYW5vdGhlci1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"image: LVMH

In a January 2009 earnings call, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault announced that the Paris-based conglomerate would largely do away with the famed Toile Monogram of its top-earning brand. Following (another) six months of slow growth in 2008, in particular, Arnault vowed that Louis Vuitton would be making changes, and this included putting its logo-covered products on the back burner to a large extent.

The move was not completely unexpected. Up until that point, few brands had experienced “logo fatigue” in as significant a manner as Louis Vuitton. After “going mainstream,” so to speak, in the late-90’s and early-to-mid-2000s by upping the quantity of logo-covered goods that were manufactured and expanding its offering in terms of price to include more accessible logo-ed products, the house embarked upon a 180-degree-turn once discerning consumers said (by way of their wallets), “Enough!” and demanded more discrete goods.

So, in an attempt to regain the favor its once-devoted well-to-do clients, Louis Vuitton’s leather goods division acted upon Arnault’s promise to prune its portfolio of logo-emblazoned canvas bags. What followed this was a large-scale revamp of the Louis Vuitton’s product offerings, including those put forth by then-creative director Marc Jacobs, who left the helm of Louis Vuitton in 2013 following the showing of his Spring/Summer 2014 collection.

In addition to looking to expensive leather and exotic-skinned bags with subtle – if any – exterior logos to right the ship, the board of LVMH enlisted Delphine Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s only daughter, who had been serving as the Deputy Chief of the designer Christian Dior Couture, to act as Louis Vuitton’s Director and executive Vice President. In that role, she “supervises all the products at Louis Vuitton – the ready-to-wear, the bags, the shoes, the accessories, the scarves, et cetera – for womenswear and menswear, but more on the business side,” she told 032c in 2016.

“I make sure we have all the right products for the different markets. Then I work on the pricing, the margins, the visual displays in the shops, all the development of the product, from first sketch until it arrives in the shops.”

A Quiet Rise

Having joined LVMH in 2000, Ms. Arnault got her start working with John Galliano on his LVMH-owned eponymous label, and had been quietly working her way up since, shying from the media (“Despite her height and stature, Arnault shrinks from media attention, approaching interviews as cautiously as one might an electrified fence,” per the Financial Times), and focusing, instead, on her various roles within the family business.

“I grew up” at Dior, she told the Financial Times in 2014: “I was 26 when I went there, and I left at 38.”

“I was in charge of the shoes,” she told 032c reflecting on her start. “I was managing the shoe business, working with the designers, making sure that the collection was good, that we didn’t just have 12-centimeter heels, but we also had flats and mid-heels.”

It was during her tenure that she ultimately rose to become Dior’s deputy managing director in 2008, second-in-command to CEO Sidney Toledano, and had a strong hand in sustaining the brand during John Galliano’s controversy-centric ouster in 2012 and the growing of it quite remarkably during Raf Simons’s tenure.

Describes her managerial approach as “quite calm,” it is also fair to say Ms. Arnault is undeniably hardworking. “Sometimes I had to push her out of the office,” Toledo told the Wall Street Journal several years ago. “I left on vacation at the beginning of August [2012], and she was still in Paris, two days before giving birth [to her daughter], sending me emails. I said, ‘Delphine, stop it!'”

In the years since, the London School of Economics-educated Delphine Arnault – who is one of the two heirs-apparent to LVMH, alongside her brother Antoine Arnault, who currently serves as CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana – has proven a strong ally for the luxury conglomerate. In addition to her most recent role as executive VP of Louis Vuitton, Delphine, 42, has served as the guiding force behind many of LVMH’s recent investments.

This includes spearheading LVMH’s recent fashion-related round of investments, which range from jewelry company Repossi to Nicholas Kirkwood’s footwear brand, Italian design brand Marco de Vincenzo, and Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson’s London-based eponymous label, among others.

And still yet, Ms. Arnault, who was coined by W magazine as “Fashion’s First Daughter,” almost singlehandedly launched the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, an initiative aimed at fostering emerging design talent. As noted by WWD, “The contest [which will return for a fifth round this year] has galvanized the industry around the challenges of upstart fashion businesses, and attracted invaluable attention to [each year’s] 30 semifinalists,” which are subsequently narrowed down to twelve and then two special prize winners, and the LVMH Prize winner.

As noted by W, the smart businesswoman is not unlike her father: “Very much in the mold of her father, Delphine Arnault delights in nurturing the creative sparks that fuel the industry, following design ideas through the multiple steps until they reach the sales floor.”

The Bigger Picture

On a broader level, however, there is a strategic shift by LVMH is underway, and that can be tied quite notably to Ms. Arnault. As the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman wrote in late 2015, LVMH is shifting “from a global sector domination machine to a kinder, friendlier giant, an approach that has been shaped by Ms. Arnault, as well as her brother, Antoine Arnault, and one that it increasingly seems may define the group for the future.”

It is worth noting that it is arguably not terribly difficult to be considered a “kinder, friendlier” giant than the LVMH we have known under the director their father, who in his role as chairman of LVMH, has been described by the press as “ruthless,” as “able to exploit,” as “famously litigious,” and as “the wolf in cashmere clothing.”

In terms of for her interest in fashion, she says that it rests most heavily on the business side. Hence, her belief that “success lies in the combination of both talent and business savvy, and that the magic comes through partnership between both. It’s important to see both sides, the business and the creativity,” she told WWD for an article, entitled, Delphine Arnault Rising.

With an impeccable educational background and the ability to work on virtually any of LVMH’s countless holdings, which range from real estate projects to strictly philanthropic endeavors, why has she opted to remain in fashion? “It is hard to reject fashion,” she told 032c. “I was ten years old when my father bought Dior. Fashion is part of my life.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998970031738281}",neutral,0.9998970031738281,0
"Op-Ed | Watch Out, LVMH and Kering — China Inc. Is Coming - The Business of Fashion","Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9jaGluYS9vcC1lZC13YXRjaC1vdXQtbHZtaC1hbmQta2VyaW5nLWNoaW5hLWluYy1pcy1jb21pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BEIJING, China — At first blush, the heroic progress of Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co. looks like the same old, same old story of an once-obscure Chinese firm on the M&A warpath.

With its origins in a Cultural Revolution-era woollen mill in the northern coal town of Jining, Ruyi's busy acquisitions of luxury-goods businesses over the past few years might seem a triumph of hope (and debt) over financial reality.

The company is the leading bidder for Bally International AG, the Swiss luxury leather-goods brand owned by closely held JAB Holding Co., and has been discussing a price of around $700 million, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Ruyi already owns British trenchcoat brand Aquascutum, controls tailors Gieves & Hawkes and Kent & Curwen via its majority share in menswear group Trinity Ltd., and spent more than $2 billion last year buying the owner of Lycra.

Ruyi's published cash-flow statements show there's a thin reed of operating cash and a fat dollop of finance capital supporting all that investment. That would suggest a bumpy journey, like those followed by Anbang Insurance Group Co., Dalian Wanda Group Co., Fosun International Ltd. and HNA Group Co. as the bills for a debt-financed acquisition strategy inevitably come due.

There's a Brand New Dance

Were Shandong Ruyi listed, it would already be among the top 20 global fashion and luxury groups by revenue.

There may be more to this latest case than meets the eye, though. The traditional flaw of the Chinese way of M&A is a tendency to focus more on buying a collection of trophy assets than on building a cohesive company. Operational synergies and market timing — the traditional ways acquisitive companies extract returns — rarely get a look-in. Fosun, which at one point mixed steel, insurance, pharmaceuticals, real estate and entertainment, is a classic example.

That's less of a problem in the luxury businesses Ruyi is targeting. Indeed, synergies can be a positive disadvantage in the sector, where brand value can depend on heritage qualities that risk being destroyed by attempts to squeeze more cash out of supply chains. Shoppers attracted to the Savile Row values of Gieves & Hawkes would probably be turned off if it started sourcing its wool from Ruyi's own mills in Shandong.

The strategy of Qiu Yafu, the chairman and controlling shareholder, has instead been to get stakes in every stage of the supply chain and clip the ticket each time. In Australia, where Gieves & Hawkes sources its wool, Ruyi's CS Agriculture Pty unit owns the vast Cubbie Station cotton farm and half of Lempriere (Australia) Pty, one of the country's largest wool suppliers. In Scotland, it bought a stake in the Carloway Mill, one of three working producers of Harris Tweed.

Judging by its access to finance, Ruyi has Beijing's blessing to build a domestic luxury powerhouse. There's potential in that ambition: China accounted for three-quarters of luxury spending growth in the eight years through 2016, according to McKinsey & Co., and will have 44 percent of the global market for such products by 2025.

Moreover, while China's acquisition machines tend to underperform when they're asked to drive down costs, in luxury goods the key competitive advantages tend to be the availability of capital to develop brands and diverse global operations to inculcate and retain internal talent.

There's no intrinsic reason why Ruyi should struggle there. It's already learning how to play up those heritage values, judging by its website: for all Jining's unglamorous present, it's also the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius and a long-standing port on China's Grand Canal.

These 10 companies have the market position and size to appeal to an acquisitive Ruyi.

The global luxury industry should take notice. If you're an underperforming brand with strong recognition in Asia (Prada SpA, say, or Salvatore Ferragamo SpA) it might be time to start primping for a takeover. And the three groups that dominate the industry — LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, and Kering — should start worrying. China Inc. is coming for you, and it's got its checkbook out.

"The Battle for the Gucci Group: ""One of the Most Bitter Fights in Corporate History"" - The Fashion Law","Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3RoZS1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXRoZS1ndWNjaS1ncm91cC1wYXJ0LWkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PART I – Just hours before two planes hit the Twins Towers in New York on Monday, September 11, 2001 as part of a larger series of coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda, news broke that “one of the most bitter fights in corporate history” had come to a head. The revelation followed from a weekend agreement – signed late on Sunday evening in Paris – between two of France’s richest men: François Pinault and Bernard Arnault. At issue: Who would claim ownership and control over one of the most famous fashion brands in the world, Gucci?

To be exact, Pinault (father of current Kering chairman François-Henri Pinault) agreed in writing to pay rival scion Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, $806 million for 8.6 million Gucci shares. The deal followed from a vicious two-and-a-half-year war.

While Pinault and Arnault were able to agree on an owner for Gucci on that Sunday evening in Paris, it was hardly the end of what has been deemed the most momentous battle to ever take place between the two conglomerate-builders and their iron-clad inner circles.

Quietly Amassing a Stake in Gucci

In 1998, despite extensive fashion (and non-fashion) acquisition efforts by LVMH and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (“PPR”), neither conglomerate boasted any publicly-known ownership stake in Gucci.

PPR (which, since 2013, has been known as Kering) would not make its first move to acquire shares in Gucci until March 1999. However, the parties’ battle for the brand that Guccio Gucci built – which the New York Post has described as “the bloodiest fight in fashion” – would first rear its ugly head for the world to see in early 1999.

It was January 5th, and Gucci’s then-CEO Domenico De Sole was en route from New York to London when he received a phone call. Yves Carcelle, a longtime friend but more importantly, a Louis Vuitton director, was on the line. He was calling to inform De Sole that LVMH had acquired a 5 percent stake in Gucci. “He wanted De Sole to understand that the investment was purely ‘passive,’ that Arnault’s intent was nothing but ‘friendly.’ Maybe, Carcelle suggested, the two companies could find ways to work together,” according to Vanity Fair.

De Sole hung up the phone. The 55-year old notoriously shrewd business mind and Harvard-trained lawyer was stunned.

The next day, on January 6, 1999, the news that Carcelle had shared with De Sole was revealed to the public: LVMH had quietly acquired a 5 percent stake in Gucci by way of the open market.

Gucci’s board members came together almost immediately. This would proceed one of two ways, they decided: LVMH would make an outright play to purchase Gucci in its entirety, or it would slowly – and quietly – continue to build up its ownership stake until it could enact a complete takeover.

Gucci, and the world, would come to learn that the latter would be LVMH’s move of choice, but they would not have to wait long to find out.

“Events developed quickly,” WWD wrote at the time. Within a matter of a few days, Arnault unabashedly escalated his acquisition efforts, buying out the 9.5 percent stake in Gucci that Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli had previously acquired. Bertelli – who was busy building a luxury fashion empire of his own at the time, taking control of fashion companies Helmut Lang and Jil Sander and shoemaker Church & Co. – had acquired a 9.5 stake in Gucci some years prior for an estimated $260 million.

In January 1999, he sold his entire stake to Arnault for $398 million. If reports are true, there was more to that deal than a $140 million profit for Bertelli. According to Forbes, “Arnault may also have promised Bertelli marketing and production collaboration between LVMH and Prada; neither executive [was willing to] comment.”

Either way, with Bertelli’s stake in hand, LVMH became Gucci’s largest single shareholder, and Arnault did not stop there. By mid-January, LVMH revealed that it had upped its stake in Gucci yet to 26.7 percent. Arnault had been busy buying shares from various sources, including Chicago-based Harris Associates’ Oakmark Select Fund.

The news of LVMH’s initial ownership and Arnault’s continued efforts to buy any – and every buy-able share in Gucci – came as a shock to both industry insiders and those within the ranks of Gucci. Among those taken aback by Arnault’s quietly cunning efforts? De Sole, who would soon come to learn that a 26.7 percent ownership stake was only just the beginning.

Arnault, then aged 50, was not content to merely hold the title of one of Gucci’s largest shareholders; a natural businessman, known for his “American style of aggressive corporate raiding and ruthless decision-making,” the LVMH chairman wanted more. So, he saw that a meeting with De Sole was arranged.

It took several days for both sides’ teams to agree to a viable date and an appropriate location for the meeting. The men ultimately met at Morgan Stanley’s offices in Paris. That was De Sole’s venue of choice; Arnault, on the other hand, had proposed a dinner.

In that meeting, which lasted just over an hour, Arnault, at times reportedly reading from a typed-up document, “lavished praise on Gucci’s management,” according to Vanity Fair. “It would be ‘a disaster’ if De Sole and [Gucci’s mega-star creative director Tom] Ford resigned,” according to Arnault, who “insisted that the last thing he wanted was ‘to go to war’ with Gucci.”

Arnault then proposed that he be allotted three seats on Gucci’s board, given his significant ownership stake.

De Sole, who had also been heavily prepped for the meeting, reacted firmly to his opponent’s proposition and niceties: three seats on the board was out of the question. As a rival, he argued, no one from LVMH would be given a place on Gucci’s board.

The meeting ended without compromise. Instead, De Sole made Arnault a counter-offer a few days later on January 27, 1999, one day after another bout of unforeseen news for Gucci: Arnault had increased LVMH’s stake in Gucci again. The result saw LVMH with a whopping 34.4 percent ownership stake in Gucci.

That number was significant. A 34.4 percent stake was a calculated power move that demonstrated that Arnault was well-aware that Gucci’s star creative director Tom Ford’s contract included language enabling him to resign without breaching his lucrative deal with the brand if any individual shareholder amassed a 35 percent ownership stake. LVMH was inching dangerously close.

Ford – with the of De Sole – had managed in just a few short years to take Gucci from its position as a brand on the brink of bankruptcy to one of the most in-demand fashion houses in the world. At the time, Gucci was nothing without Tom Ford, and Arnault knew this.

“I was furious!,” Ford told Vanity Fair in 2014, reflecting on LVMH’s too-close-for-comfort 34.4 percent stake.

On January 27, the day after he got wind of LVMH’s latest stake, De Sole met with Arnault and made his counter-offer. The Gucci CEO proposed that LVMH be given two – not three – seats on Gucci’s board. In return, however, LVMH would be required to reduce its 34.4 percent stake to 20 percent. LVMH would also have to guarantee that Gucci would be able to operate independently of LVMH, and LVMH would be required to ensure that De Sole and Ford – and De Sole and Ford, alone – would remain in control of the brand.

De Sole and Arnault parted ways, again, without resolution.

A few days later, in early February, Arnault rejected De Sole’s offer, and wasted little time in going straight to Gucci’s board to demand a special meeting of the company’s most prominent shareholders. Uninterested in negotiating any further, the Frenchman would nominate a ninth member to the company’s existing eight-member board, someone to represent the interests of LVMH. This was well within his rights.

Yes, as noted by the New York Times, it was in line with Gucci’s bylaws that “anyone with a stake of 10 percent or more can ask for a special meeting and that the meeting must be held within six weeks.” LVMH had a 34.4 percent stake, and so, Arnault’s camp was entitled to much more than an honorary title in the company. It was entitled to voting rights.

That special meeting of the Gucci board never happened, as just four days later, De Sole made Arnault an offer: Buy the entire company for $85 per share. Arnault did not take the bait. He did, however, agree to read – and consider entering into – an acquisition standstill (an agreement to halt plans to further increase LVMH’s ownership of Gucci) in exchange for a number of seats on Gucci’s board.

For De Sole, Arnault’s willingness to entertain the deal was a surprise and a pleasant one. It was a show of civility between the two men, perhaps. More generally, it was a promising indication for the future of the parties’ negotiations, particularly since a standstill was imperative in De Sole’s view. Unbeknownst to anyone, he was actively harboring suspicions that Arnault had come to secretly possess some undeclared three million shares of Gucci stock over the previous year.

With that in mind, he certainly was not comforted by Arnault’s adamant assertions that LVMH was merely building a “passive stake” in Gucci and not fashioning a creeping takeover designed to enable the conglomerate to stealthily gain control of the Italian fashion brand without its knowledge or approval.

Within just a few short hours, De Sole saw that a standstill agreement was drafted and sent to Arnault’s “right hand,” Pierre Godé. In exchange for multiple seats on Gucci’s board, LVMH had two days to read, sign, and return the agreement. The due date was February 17. There would be no exceptions, and no such offer would be extended to Arnault again. He had one shot and this was it.

At precisely 5:01 pm on the 17th, the agreement was faxed back to De Sole’s office in Milan. It was unsigned.

Arnault had changed his mind.

LVMH Hopes Hedi Slimane Will Triple Profits At Céline - British Vogue,"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvY2VsaW5lLXByb2ZpdC1hbWJpdGlvbi1oZWRpLXNsaW1hbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getty

BERNARD ARNAULT, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, has high hopes for his latest appointment: Hedi Slimane at Céline.

“The objective with him is to reach at least two billion to three billion euros, and perhaps more, within five years,” Arnault told reporters at LVMH’s Paris headquarters on Thursday. “Everything is in place for this brand to achieve quite exceptional growth.”

Currently Céline sits just below Fendi on LVMH’s brand leaderboard, with profits close to one billion euros in 2017. If Slimane lives up to Arnault’s “global superstar” hype, he will have to triple the brand’s profits at the French house. During Slimane’s four-year tenure at Saint Laurent he propelled the brand past one billion euros in sales.

Arnault's comments chime with the official announcement of Slimane’s appointment as artistic, creative and image director of Céline on January 21. ""I am particularly happy that Hedi is back within the LVMH Group and taking the reins of our Céline Maison,” he said. “I have been a great admirer of his work since we collaborated on Dior Homme, which he launched to global critical acclaim in the 2000s. His arrival at Céline reinforces the great ambitions that LVMH has for this Maison.”

"Hedi Slimane to Join Céline, Launch Men's and Couture - The Business of Fashion","Sun, 21 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvaGVkaS1zbGltYW5lLXRvLWpvaW4tY2VsaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — In an announcement that took the fashion industry by surprise, LVMH announced on Sunday that Hedi Slimane is set to join Céline, starting February 1. The designer will take on the title of artistic, creative and image director, and expand the LVMH-owned label's offering into menswear, couture and fragrance. He will show his first collection for the brand in September during Paris Fashion Week. Slimane takes over at Céline from Phoebe Philo, who announced she would be leaving the house after its Autumn 2018 presentation in March.

""I am particularly happy that Hedi is back within the LVMH Group and taking the reins of our Céline maison,"" said LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault in a statement. ""He is one of the most talented designers of our time. I have been a great admirer of his work since we collaborated on Dior Homme, which he launched to global critical acclaim in the 2000s. His arrival at Céline reinforces the great ambitions that LVMH has for this maison.""

Slimane has a storied past at Dior Homme, a brand he singlehandledly created and built between 2000 and 2007, popularising the skinny silhouette in menswear. He left, in part, because he wanted to launch his own label, doing both men's and women's wear. Before his tenure at Dior Homme, the Frenchman worked at Yves Saint Laurent, to which he returned in 2012 to helm the brand's womenswear and menswear labels.

At Saint Laurent, Slimane's creative directorship divided opinion, but his LA youth culture-driven collections commanded the attention of the global fashion industry and drove stellar financial results: In his first three years, the French brand more than doubled annual sales revenue to €707 million in 2014 (about $787 million), up from €353 million in 2011. However, the designer exited the Parisian house suddenly in April 2016 amid reports of a falling out with François Henri Pinault, chairman of Kering, which owns Yves Saint Laurent.

On joining Céline, Slimane will be reunited with Sidney Toledano, the influential chief executive who led Dior, one of the world's most coveted brands, through global expansion and has overseen the creative directorships of John Galliano, Raf Simons and Maria Grazia Chiuri. Slimane's appointment follows BoF's announcement in November 2017 that Toledano is handing over his role to Fendi chief executive Pietro Beccari in 2018, as he steps into the position of chairman of the LVMH Fashion Group, which includes Céline as well as Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Nicholas Kirkwood and Marc Jacobs.

During her 10-year tenure at Céline, Philo turned the once-middling label into a fashion authority with her minimalist designs. She was also behind many of Céline's hit bags, including the Phantom, Trapeze and Trio. Over the past decade, the London-based designer help lift Céline's annual sales from €200 million (about $236 million at current exchange) to more than €700 million ($828 million), according to analysts. (LVMH does not break out figures for the label.) Yet the brand was a digital laggard: it only launched an Instagram account in 2017, and in November, it launched its first presence on WeChat.

In December, Céline — then the only LVMH-owned fashion business without its own e-commerce business — started to offer online sales in France, and plans to eventually roll out to the rest of Europe and the United States in 2018. The move comes at a time when e-commerce is one of the most significant growth opportunities in the luxury market — in the next 10 years, McKinsey & Company expects the share of luxury sales occurring online to triple, making e-commerce the world's third largest luxury market after China and the US.

It is understood that Slimane will maintain his home base of Los Angeles in his new role at Céline, while shuttling to Paris, where the label is based.

“I am delighted to join Bernard Arnault in this all-embracing and fascinating mission for Céline,” said Slimane. “I greatly look forward to returning to the exciting world of fashion and the dynamism of the ateliers.”

Sidney Toledano added: ""Hedi Slimane is an exceptional designer, complete artist and passionate about his work. I am certain that he will bring his renowned creative energy and discipline to lead Céline to ever greater success.""

Stephanie Watine Arnault’s Clos19 Is Elevating the Art of Drinking - Observer,"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvc3RlcGhhbmllLXdhdGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWNsb3MxOS13aW5lcy1hbmQtc3Bpcml0cy1sdm1oL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDEvc3RlcGhhbmllLXdhdGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWNsb3MxOS13aW5lcy1hbmQtc3Bpcml0cy1sdm1oL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Generational wealth can be something of an enigma. When playing by the old rules, all it took was one intelligent risk-taker to create a nest egg that could fund an entire family tree for decades—and sometimes centuries—to come. The same is not true of the Arnault family, who, among their many investments, are the largest stakeholders in Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. While the business is certainly an example of generational wealth, as the luxury conglomerate owns an impressive number of fashion and spirit brands, the Arnaults also happen to be a skillful bunch.

Leading the pack is Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH (LVMHF); his daughter Delphine Arnault, 42, is the director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. Then there are his sons: Antoine Arnault, 40, who sits at the helm of both Berluti and Loro Piana and Alexandre Arnault, 25, who heads the recently acquired German luggage label, Rimowa. After proving themselves, all three earned the reigns to these already-established businesses, but one member of the family has decided to start from scratch. Enter Stephanie Watine Arnault, 33, the niece of Bernard, who has founded Clos19, an LVMH-owned venture. Clos19 is a digital platform that operates as a three-tiered system with a hand in just about every aspect of wine and spirits, starting with sales and ending in consumption. From cocktail recipes and food pairings to far-flung excursions at the Veuve Clicquot maison, the overarching goal of Clos19 is to bring a new level of connection to the world of spirits. “I observed the market, and noticed that nobody was explaining how to use the product. There were plenty of places to buy beautiful champagnes, wines, and spirits, but nobody is giving you that extra layer of lifestyle, of what to enjoy your Champagne or wine with, or how to craft a cocktail recipe in a fun way,” said Watine Arnault. So she set out to create an experience, where the customers could discover the history behind their favorite wine and liquor—all while becoming a better host.

Three years in the making, Clos19 first bowed last November and has since hummed along with a steady flow of unique products and experiences, all paired with striking visual content. The site does seem to tick all of the boxes associated with the next crop of luxury spirits consumers: The Millennial. You know, those who prefer pictures over words and first-hand experiences over tangible luxury goods. The only thing that does not pander to the average millennial is, perhaps, the price point. A bottle of Dom Pérignon Vintage 2009, available through a partnership with delivery service Thirstie, will set you back $109, while a six-day visit to New Zealand’s wine country, complete with private jet transfer, will cost you several thousands. And yet, these luxe offerings stand alongside gratis advice for aspiring hosts. With meticulous continuity of style, readers can readily navigate a library of recipes and instructional videos on how to craft the Elderflower Cosmopolitan using Belvedere Citrus Vodka, or a “hot toddy with a twist” using Hennessy VSOP Cognac. “We don’t like to describe our customers by an age group, but by affinities,” Watine Arnualt was quick to point out. “Our customer is a hedonist. Somebody who enjoys eating and drinking and knowing more and improving their lifestyle. More and more you have these young chefs and foodies who appear, and they’re not stuffy. There are one Michelin star restaurants underground now. These are the hedonist people we want this idea to resonate with.”

It’s the hedonist—the frivolous consumer with a taste for the finest—that keeps Watine Arnault and her team of 22 employees busy. But it’s also an archetype that strikes a nostalgic cord within the astute businesswoman. “When I was a little girl, we always used to have family lunches on Sunday, like many families, and I remember my grandmother would ask me to come see her on the side and she would give me a little sip from her champagne glass,” Watine Arnault recalled. “So from a very early age I developed a taste.”

Before creating Clos19, Watine Arnault walked a winding trail through the LVMH brands. That included a two-year stint as the store manager of Louis Vuitton’s Bond Street menswear universe in London that she considers to be her most valuable work experience. “When I came out of my MBA at INSEAD, I knew that I needed to know who the customers are, and what they like, and how to manage retail operations,” she told Observer. “So, when my friends decided to go into investment banking and consulting, I decided to go and work in the store. It was very hands-on every day, and I valued it a lot, because it is rare that you have the chance to meet your customer every day. You get first-hand feedback, and it’s a great way to learn how to improve.”

It’s experiences like these that clearly show the Arnaults won’t settle with a single success story. With that in mind, it seems no one can rest on their laurels.

“We have to find our own path and work with the great people who are working within our companies,” Watine Arnault said. “We have to explain exactly what we want to do, and be treated the same as everybody else, and there’s beauty in that.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999759197235107}",neutral,0.9999759197235107,0
Smashbox makeup artist takes LVMH to court over alleged copy of lip art - us.fashionnetwork.com,"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdXMuZmFzaGlvbm5ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3Mvc21hc2hib3gtbWFrZXVwLWFydGlzdC10YWtlcy1sdm1oLXRvLWNvdXJ0LW92ZXItYWxsZWdlZC1jb3B5LW9mLWxpcC1hcnQsOTM0Njc3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Smashbox makeup artist takes LVMH to court over alleged copy of lip art By



Robin Driver Published

Jan 10, 2018

Vlada Haggerty, Smashbox’s recently appointed “lip editor in chief”, filed her complaint in federal court in California late last week, alleging that -owned (MUFE) copied her lip art in its logo for its new Lustrous cosmetics line.







An image posted by Haggerty on Instagram showing her ""Dripping Gold"" and ""Rose Gold Lip Art"" images above MUFE's Lustrous logo - Instagram: @vladamua



The logo in question depicts parted lips coated in high-gloss lacquer which is forming a drop on the bottom lip. Haggerty alleges that the image copies two “dripping lip” looks which she first published on her in 2015 under the titles “Dripping Gold” and “Rose Gold Lip Art”.



of Haggerty’s images are copyrighted and the “Rose Gold” variation is a registered trademark.

A statement issued on the makeup artist’s lawyer’s website, claims that MUFE’s logo does more than simply take inspiration from Haggerty’s work, as it exactly replicates her lip art’s drip placement, highlights and “distinctive texture”. It also states that use of the image to promote the brand’s Lustrous line has led to “actual confusion as to whether Vlada is affiliated or collaborating with MUFE,” citing comments from Instagram users.



According to the makeup artist, MUFE had previously approached her concerning a possible collaboration in 2016 and 2017, but she declined as she was already working with a competing cosmetics company under an exclusive contract.



“After Vlada declined MUFE’s requests, MUFE went ahead and adopted an unauthorized logo for its new line of “Lustrous” cosmetics that directly copied Vlada’s trademarked and copyrighted lip art,” the statement concluded.



Haggerty also took to social media to call out the makeup brand, posting a comparison image on her Instagram and telling her over 803,000 followers, “If you too were wondering about the MUFE's holiday collection: no, I did not collaborate with them on it. Instead, I said 'No' multiple times, but they clearly went ahead and used my images anyway.”



Vlada Haggerty is a Ukrainian-born, LA-based makeup artist who has been featured by brands such as Labs, Cover Girl and NYX Cosmetics.



She previously threatened Kylie Jenner’s with legal action via Instagram in 2015, although a complaint was never filed.



With new communication technologies leading consumers to expect ever greater transparency and accountability from companies, social media has established itself as the favored platform for designers and other creatives wishing to publicly shame brands over alleged copies.



Designer Lisa Marie Fernandez published details of her case against Emily Ratajkowski’s Inamorata Swim line on her Instagram account in November of last year, while Jimmy Kimmel recently took to to denounce alleged copies of his daughter’s designs produced by Reformation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9970346689224243}",neutral,0.9970346689224243,0

The luxury goods giant holds stakes in many coveted international brands like Dior, Fendi and Givenchy, to name a few.

While it may seem like an odd arrangement at the outset, there lies some logic in the fact that health has become the ultimate luxury to invest in. An acknowledged fashion powerhouse, LVMH intends to up-sell the products that Patanjali produces and could invest $500 million to this end, according to a report in the Economic Times.

Seeing Ayurveda brand's meteoric rise as India's fastest growing FMCG company, L Catterton Asia—a private equity firm co-owned by LVMH—has expressed interest in taking it to a global platform. Established as a private limited company in 2006, Patanjali is reported to have hit revenues of Rs 2,000 crore across 4,000 stores in 2015. While the indigenous brand is seeking investors and this move could help their products get a global reach, their business model which is positioned against multinational corporations may prove to be a hurdle in this alliance with LVMH. While Acharya Balkrishna, Patanjali CEO, stated in the Economic Times piece that the company isn't open to selling stakes or equity to foreign MNCs, Ravi Thakran, managing partner at L Catterton has expressed his enthusiasm, saying that they would “love to work with him if we can find a (business) model.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999548196792603}",neutral,0.9999548196792603,0

""It's a lifestyle."" Such holistic thinking is appropriate coming from a creative talent whose trademark is an all-inclusive approach to restoration, architecture, and design, whether for a private residence for the likes of Bill and Melinda Gates or as storied a property as New York's Woolworth Building. With Design Partners, Despont's talents are matched by his longtime friend, who is no stranger to close collaboration: She worked alongside her brother Alberto until his death in 2012 and now runs Cabinet Alberto Pinto.

The two hope that Design Partners will become for the interior design world what LVMH is for the luxury goods market. ""LVMH has different brands, from wine to hotels, to fashion, all within LVMH,"" Pinto explains. ""We want to try to do that with DP.""

""We are combining our experience and friendship into one total design house which will offer services from architecture to interior design on all luxury projects: residences, planes, boats, hotels,"" continues Despont. ""We are establishing a new brand with a capacity to work all over Europe, the U.S., and the Middle East.""

For the duo, who are longtime friends as well as admirers of each other's work, the collaboration seemed like a natural extension of their practice. ""We realized one day we have basically the same company: me in Europe, Thierry in New York,"" says Pinto. ""So it was natural to be together. It’s new, but it feels like it should have been like this for a long time. We’re so complementary.""

So much so that the client lists of the two firms—which Pinto and Despont will continue to operate, at least for now, separately along with Design Partners—were nearly indistinguishable. ""We realized that very often we would be serving the same clients on different projects,"" explains Despont. ""Linda would work with them in Europe and then in the U.S., I’d work with them. So we serve a multicultural, international clientele. In today’s time, there’s no reason to be locked in to one country.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999922513961792}",neutral,0.9999922513961792,0
Record year for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton - Inside Retail Australia,"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3JlY29yZC15ZWFyLWZvci1sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi0yMDE4MDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It has been another record year for luxury products group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Revenue increased by 13 per cent year on year to reach €42.6 billion (US$52.9 billion), while organic revenue growth was 12 per cent.

All business groups recorded double-digit organic growth with the exception of wines and spirits, where second-half growth was hit by supply constraints.

Profit from recurring operations reached €8.2 billion, up 18 per cent. Operating margin reached 19.5 per cent, while the group share of net profit was €5.1 billion, growth of 29 per cent.

Describing the performance as “excellent”, LVMH chairman/CEO Bernard Arnault says the record year was partly because of a buoyant environment but above all a result of the creative strength of the group’s brands “and their ability to constantly reinvent themselves”.

Key highlights of last year listed by the group include:

● Record revenue and profit from recurring operations.

● Growth in Asia, Europe and the US.

● The success of both iconic and new products at Louis Vuitton, “whose profitability remains at an exceptional level”.

● The acquisition of Christian Dior Couture.

● Growth at Fendi and Loro Piana.

● The first year of integration of Rimowa luggage.

● Strong momentum at Parfums Christian Dior, driven by product innovation.

● An excellent year for Bulgari and good progress at Hublot and Tag Heuer.

● Growth at Sephora.

● Free cashflow of €4.7 billion, up 20 per cent.

“Significant” growth in China helped Hennessy cognac volumes grow by 8 per cent, with 7.5 million cases shipped despite the second-half supply constraints.

In fashion and leather goods, key events of the year were products arising from collaborations with artist Jeff Koons as well as the Supreme brand, the launch of the brand’s first smartwatch and the inauguration of the Maison Louis Vuitton Vendome in Paris.

There was rapid growth in Asia for the perfumes and cosmetics segment, and growth was particularly strong in Asia for Bulgari. Asia again shone in the selective retailing group with Sephora continuing to gain market share.

LVMH says the year was a positive turning point for DFS, with new stores in Cambodia and Italy continuing to grow sales.

Despite unfavourable currencies and geopolitical uncertainties, LVMH says it is well equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups this year.

CEO Spotlight: LVMH's Bernard Arnault - Born2Invest,"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybjJpbnZlc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2Nlby1zcG90bGlnaHQtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault is the CEO and Chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Company since 1990. Part of his tasks is to oversee luxury brands such as Dom Perignon, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, Sephora, De Beers, Bulgari and Tag Heuer.

Brief background

Arnault was born in Roubaix, France on March 5, 1949. His father owned an engineering company. Years later, he took over the family’s construction and property business firm called Ferret-Savinel. He finished high school at Maxence Van Der Meersch in Roubaix and earned his engineering degree in École Polytechnique in 1971.

His estimated net worth is $73.6 billion. Considered the wealthiest man in France, Arnault is ranked 11th on the Forbes’ list of billionaires in 2017 and he placed 66th on the list of most powerful people in 2015.

He has married twice and has five children in total, two from the first marriage with Anne Dewavrin and three from his second wife, pianist Helene Mercier. Two of his children named Delphine and Antoine are now helping him run his luxury goods empire.

Passion for the arts and career

Arnault is also a renowned art collector and his collection includes a Claude Monet, Mark Rothko, Picasso, Yves Klein, Henry Moore, Andy Warhol and Bernard Buffet. He is credited with building the Louis Vuitton museum in Paris’ Bois de Boulogne. The $135 million worth facility was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in public in 2014.

After taking over the family business, he convinced his father to sell the company and transform it into a real estate firm. The company’s name also changed to Ferinel, which specialized in constructing holiday accommodations.

In 1984, he collaborated with the senior partner of Lazard Frères et Cie Antoine Bernheim to acquire Financière Agache. After the deal was signed, Arnault managed a textile company called Boussac which owned Christian Dior and the department store Le Bon Marché. He later sold Boussac but retained Christian Dior brand and Le Bon Marché department store.

He also serves as the President of the Board of Directors of Groupe Arnault S.E., a holding company owned by his family.

Leadership at LVMH

Arnault has control over half of LVMH which has over 3,900 retail stores and spans over 70 luxurious brands which feature Christian Dior, Dom Perignon, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, and Sephora. In 2016, LVMH posted revenues of $41.6 billion. He also entered the yacht business after acquiring Princess Yachts for €253 million and Royal van Lent.

He has expanded his empire and made investments in Netflix, Blue Capital, and Carrefour. As well as in Boo.com, Libertysurf, and Zebank. The company also acquired Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, R.M Williams, EDUN, Moynat and Donna Karen. Arnault, however, has failed to buy Hermes. It is safe to say that majority of luxury brands today are under LVMH and under the leadership of Arnault.

With such a huge success, Arnault says he is not done yet and will not rest on his laurels. “What I love is to win. What I love is being number one. But yes, today I still feel passionate about taking on brands like Dior, and mixing those world famous roots with modernity,” he explains. In fact, when he took over Louis Vuitton, he managed to grow its revenue ten times despite the company already enjoying relevancy at that time.

He has worked with Marc Jacobs, Alexander McQueen and John Galliano which earned him the nickname, “The Pope of Fashion” from Women’s Wear Daily.

Tax issues

The billionaire was allegedly involved in tax evasion case before. This was initially thought as the reason why he once sought to become a citizen of Belgium. To clear the issue, he dropped applying for Belgian citizenship altogether. “I explained several times that I would remain a resident of France and that I would continue to pay my taxes there. In vain – the message did not get through,” a part of his statement reads.

Philanthropic works

LVMH has been supporting various organizations in the past such as Save the Children, the Foundation for Hospitals in Paris and Princess Grace of Monaco Foundation.

Awards and achievements

In 2007, he received the Commmandeur of the Légion d’Honneur. Four years later, he was a recipient of the Grand Officer of the Légion d’Honneur and the Woodrow Wilson Award for Global Corporate Citizenship. In 2012, he was given the Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and two years later, he was the recipient of The Museum of Modern Art’s David Rockefeller Award.
